She'll always be with you, right?
Look, I'm...
I can't stay but er...
I want you to have this.
But promise me... promise me you won't open it until your birthday, OK?
- OK.
- OK.
Come here.
Aunty Di says that you're ill, that it wasn't your fault, not really.
No...
Aunty Di's upset.
You know?
We all are.
But I haven't done anything bad, OK?
You remember that.
Whatever people say, trust me, OK?
It's a conspiracy, right?
Like JFK.
Yeah, that's right.
That's exactly what it's like.
Look, I have to go, but I'm coming back for you, OK?
I am coming back for you, darling.
Come here.
AUNTY DI:
Martha?
- Don't go, please!
- Come on.
- Come on, let's hide this from Aunty.
- Martha?
Martha?
Quick now, they're calling you now.
Off you go.
Go.
I love you.
Go.
Martha?
Go on, go!
- What are you doing?
- I couldn't find my ball.
Oh, come on.
You OK?
This is all down to Hagan.
Walk to your car.
- What do you think you're doing?
- Right now, or I will kill you here.
Do as he says.
We've got the disc with Danush's murder on it.
I want you to make a full confession - that and the disc will blow this thing wide open.
And what thing is this, exactly?
God's Fist!
But I have no absolutely no idea what you are talking about.
- Alice, what are you doing with this man?
- This is not up for debate.
You will go to the police, tell them you are funding a secret death squad and you are being backed by the Validus Group.
You will tell them a member of that death squad killed my wife, and tell them his name was Elliott and he committed suicide on the 24 bus.
- They'll put me in a straitjacket.
- Enough.
The truth or I'll put a fucking bullet in your head!
Hagan's channeling money from Validus through Defence Concern to fund God's Fist.
He wants to create conflict.
Conflict creates wealth, and they don't just fund God's Fist, they fund Islamic groups as well, to fan the flames, to keep the war on terror alive and well.
But for me this is... is just about protecting our Christian democratic way of life, you know that.
For Hagan it's just business.
- How do I prove that?
- You can't, they've covered their tracks.
There's no paper trail, it would be like climbing a stair of sand.
- Where is he?
- Hagan?
- I have no...
- Where is he?
He's in his hotel.
The London Regent.
- Get in.
(RUSTLING)
Get in!
Drive him about till I call you.
Don't do what I think you're going to, it won't change anything.
Yes, it will.
Max?
What about the disc?
If anything should happen to me, Jimmy Kerrigan, my news editor.
Ground floor covered.
We still running to schedule?
Yeah, Hagan's leaving by the basement door in the next five minutes.
- Can I help you?
- Stay where you are, don't move.
- Put the gun down, sir.
- I will shoot you.
- I told you to put the gun down.
- I mean it.
Urgh!
(WHIMPERS)
Mr Hagan's leaving now.
Move and you're both dead.
Listen to him.
Put the gun down, Mr Raban, let's talk.
About what?
The fact that you killed my wife?
I can assure you, Mr Raban, I did not kill your wife.
Stay where you are.
HAGAN:
Mr Raban seems confused.
I'm telling the truth.
If I'm guilty of anything it's of trying to protect you and your cherished freedoms.
God's Fist isn't trying to protect anything.
Conflict means profits, right?
It's the way of the world.
You can either harness chaos to your own advantage or get swamped by it, but we are on the same side.
BLAKE:
It's OK, it's OK.
He doesn't have the guts.
Do you?
What?
Even after we killed your wife, you don't have the guts.
What are you saying?
You just can't pull that trigger.
When it comes to the crunch, you bottle it, Like you did with that woman Helen McVay.
- Blake, shut up!
- You've a chance to cut off the serpent's head.
You still can't do it, can you?
Cut off the serpent's head.
- Can you?
- He was at Hagan's seminar talking to Daniel.
They've got plans for you, mate.
Big plans.
The Defence Secretary's having an affair with an erotic dancer.
We need dirt.
COSGRAVE:
Hagan's channeling money from Validus, through Defence Concern to fund God's Fist.
This is all down to Hagan.
Cut off the serpent's head.
You want this.
You want me to kill him.
You...
Leave it!
What's going on?
(GUNSHOT)
Somebody call an ambulance!
Hagan's been shot.
We need an ambulance!
Hagan's dead.
But Raban isn't,
He's missing.
It's done.
Hagan dead at the hands of a lone gunman with links to Iran.
(LAUGHTER) It's just what we wanted.
You did the right thing.
And er... and Raban?
Well, he's still alive, unfortunately.
Still, you have the disc?
(PUNCHES IN NUMBER)
- Mamood Asir.
- Mr Asir?
How did your meeting with Alice Ross go?
Who is this?
I'm with Defence Concern.
It's a follow-up call on your meeting with Miss Ross yesterday.
I'm sorry, I don't know anyone called Miss Ross.
You spoke to her.
She came to see you at the Inns of Court?
No, I'm sorry, I never saw anyone yesterday.
I was in court all day.
You must be mistaken.
TV:
And some shocking news just breaking.
Ex-US Secretary of Defence Donald Hagan has been assassinated.
The senior US statesman and Vietnam War hero has been fatally wounded as he left his hotel at the start of his return... (TV OFF)
You set me up.
You shouldn't have come here, Max.
The defence cuts were a disaster for God's Fist, they needed another 9/11.
Hagan's assassination would achieve that for them.
Right so far?
Nobody's gonna listen to you, Max.
Nobody.
They were even willing to sacrifice the man that created them.
You knew the minute you told me to forget about the Validus Group, I'd do the opposite.
You had the Slovenian girl plant the fax in the Defence Secretary's bin.
Why me, Jimmy?
You were the ideal candidate, Max.
Paranoid, desperate for a conspiracy story, ideal to manipulate.
You didn't let us down, did you?
You made the perfect assassin.
Oh, it's high risk, sure.
Elliott nearly screwed the whole thing up by topping himself but it's worked.
(TV ON)
- Just look.
We know who this journalist is.
We have proof of direct links with the Iranian Secret Service.
But how can you talk about defence cuts after this?
Worked like a dream, eh?
When did you become like them?
Like them?
Max, for years I listened to your self-righteous rants and let you look down on me.
But we both know you looked after number one, eh?
Look at Helen.
- Look at what you did to Helen.
- You can't compare this...
Out of everyone we knew, she was the best, the brightest, the most courageous.
Max, she had a real future and you came and took it away from her.
You think I forgave you?
Look on the bright side, though...
You finally got yourself a real conspiracy.
And the mood in Washington... is grim.
If Iran is involved in this assassination, when the President expects the British Prime Minister to take a very hard line.
The President's view is that recent UK defence cuts must stop.
It's thought he will encourage the UK to step up their military presence in the Middle East and stand firm with the US in taking direct action on the Iranian situation.
Thank you for that, Madeleine.
We will go over shortly to Downing Street where the Prime...
- Destroy the disc, will you?
- Daniel?
- The PM's gonna make a speech about Iran.
- Daniel, it's a...
This is exactly what we want.
He has to do something or the Americans...
It's a girl band!
His daughter's got it.
He must have swapped the disc.
(DIALS NUMBER)
Blake, Raban's daughter's got your trophy disc.
Get it back.
(MOBILE RINGS)
He didn't trust me.
When did they get to you?
Just before you resigned, right?
Look, I'm sorry about your wife.
I'm sorry about Majid Danush, but this wasn't the time to sit on the fence.
Our boys are dying every day out there.
My brother is not coming home in a cardboard coffin because of people like you, Max.
I had to choose.
I chose my brother,
I chose my country
- I did the right thing.
Did you?
(COINS RATTLE IN SLOT)
(PUNCHES IN NUMBER)
(MOBILE RINGS)
Hi.
Here, keep an eye on that guy for us, I'm gonna go and make a call.
Argh!

Argh!
Argh...
(PHONE RINGS)
- Hello?
I'm here.
She's safe.
Thank you.
Hello.
Mercy, isn't it?
It's Louise, and we don't sell alcohol after ten.
Oh, I'm not buying it, I'm stealing it.
Fine with me, it ain't my wine.
How's life, anyway?
Still shit?
If I told you, you wouldn't believe me.
Can I borrow your mobile, please, Louise?
Just for a minute?
Sure.

I repeat, lock your fingers, palms up, on top of your head, or we fire.

What's going on?
ELLIOTT:
Shit!
BLAKE:
Christ!
You wanted him dead, didn't you?
The bullet's still in there, they can trace it, you arsehole!
TV:
Images broadcast on the internet...
- Daniel.
...apparently show the murder of Majid Danush by what can only be described as a death squad.
Links with Pungus Dei, or God's Fist as these vigilantes are known, have already been made to rogue officers from our own security services and there is the suggestion that the policy group Defence Concern may also be involved.
(SIRENS, SHOUTING)
(COMMOTION)
Daddy!
Dad!
"Surrounded her a heap of matchbox, ...and much-many burned matchsticks.
A poor little thing wanted to get warm the people said it.
Nobody knew it she, how much bliss saw, and the glorious light that surrounded her, when, cradled in her grandmother's arms, she left this dark world forever."
Why haven't I got a daddy?
Why are we always alone?
You're still too tiny to understand, but believe Mummy, when she tells you that we are better off as we are.
You're the mum everything, You're the apple of her eye.
As long as we've got each other We need nobody else.
You know?
Congratulations!
Some to you, my old egg.
Work was beautiful!
We say thank you for it.
Beni!
- Thank you, thank you.
- Congratulate, was divine!
Somewhere Oscar and between Nobel.
We could set it up an interview!
Good, good.
Sure.
Be reversed already, my old egg!
You, these adored the film.
Don't believe a word that they say?
David, it was puke.
What are you talking about?
They're all going mad about it!
What a catastrophe.
Whatever made them think...?
The book was sweet.
Just very slightly chauvinistic.
Yet beautiful that it, since a fella wrote it.
And that was three years ago now.
You wrote a good book three years ago, and now you've just helped to ruin it completely, and you want me to congratulate you like this lot?
Get a load of her!
Her!
That's more important than whether or not, your fans like it.
Okay, but you know about these things.
Hello, baby!
A new fan?
Oh, I don't know.
I take no notice!
- Beni, come over here!
- Ah, the computer geek!
Read from you in the yellow press.
It is written, there is everything properly with you, you are happy, and the baby comes.
- Hey, when's the wedding?
- No wedding, no baby!
If God had made Dávid instead of Adam, man would have died lonely under the apple tree!
That really is a gem for Miss Tabloid.
Thanks, Beni!
- Ciao, enjoy the party!
- Bye, Babe!
I'm going.
I am sorry.
- I ask for an auto...
- I do not have time for this now.
- Could I receive an autograph?
- Hello!
- Do you have a pen?
- No.
I apologize, onto a minute.
Who may I write it to?
Eventually, not your name interests.
Thank you.
You can thank me later.
The last time I saw enthusiasm like this was at Queen concert in 1986.
Really?
That was before I was born.
Don't be cheeky!
What are you doing?
Hunting?
Escaping.
Gábor?
I know a quite place.
Angi!
You didn't like the film, did you?
We can talk about the film some other time.
So, to what do I owe the pleasure?
You owe it to the fact, that you haven't written a line for three years.
Let's not start that now.
You'll have it, okay?
- Tell me, how much have you done?
- I'm finished.
- Oh, Dávid!
- Halfway through...
I still haven't written a single word.
Sweetheart!
The directors have had enough.
I can't carry on defending you, and I don't really want to anymore.
Angi!
I'm your star performer.
I'm the hen laying the gold egg.
Once, his neck is cut off.
Be in my office at ten tomorrow morning!
That's not an invitation, it's an ultimatum.
9 and a Half Dates
You look like shit!
Steamroller?
Your wife!
My ex... ex-wife.
Since I left, she has been forced to practice her domina tendencies on others.
And what are you going to write in your column tomorrow?
Or can't you tell me to my face?
Good book shit film.
You should have spent more time on the script, and less on the self-promotion!
And you really know what you're talking about, don't you?
You're still here getting wasted on the free booze.
Hey, you've pissed on your shoes!
Emma?
- Let us go away?
- Let's go.
And where you read it?
But why not?
I cannot believe it!
Drink!
- Good evening, Vilmos!
- Good evening, Mr. Debreceni!
My niece!
What?
Of course, Sir!
Mr. Debreceni!
What is it?
Good evening, Miss.
Yes?
It's time your bill was settled!
You haven't paid for a good few weeks now, Sir!
And is that why you are stopping me in the middle of the night?
Yes, Sir!
And I thought you wanted to thank me on the premiere.
- I suppose you've heard about it.
- Of course!
- Sure!
Congratulations!
- So send up a bottle of champagne!
Make that two!
Arsehole!
Miss?
323.
Mr. Debreceni?
I am guessing that you are his niece.
Maybe.
The rest of the family are upstairs.
I don't believe it!
That'll be the champagne!
Don't stop now!
323?
Am I intruding?
Does it look like it?
I don't believe it!
Miss!
Miss, there is no way that I can allow you to go up there.
- Good evening, Vilmos!
Why not?
- Evening.
Well, because there's a quarantine.
- What?
- That's right.
It's sealed off because of a tsetse.
A giant tsetse fly got away, and if he stings somebody so you can't go up.
- Medical regulation!
- Please!
- Over my dead body.
- I apologize.
- I couldn't allow something to happen to you!
Have you gone mad?
Why won't you let the director's daughter enter the building?
- Please, come in!
- Thank you!
- Please, feel free.
- And the quarantine?
- Sorry?
What quarantine?
Not again!
Who's that?
Whoever it is, there's no more room!
This must be the champagne!
Room service!
What?
Mr. Kempelen sends it and congratulates.
You bastard!
Tünde!
Tünde!
Wait!
Shitface!
You're a shitface!
We were just celebrating.
What now?
Be a bit more understanding!
I've had enough!
You're sick, David!
Sick!
You're genetically incapable of being faithful!
You know it what the faithfulness is about for you?
It means private property!
My hotel!
My boyfriend!
My money!
- However this my life!
- Is it?
Well you've just ruined it!
Reveille!
Good morning, Mr. Arsehole!
Hey...
- It is known who I am?
Of course, how we know it.
- You can't do this to me, Kempelen!
- Oh, but I can!
And this is yours, and this!
"Following the premiere of the film based on his book,
Dávid Debreceni split up with his girlfriend, the Tokaj Media Empire and with a chain hotel's heir.
This foolish mistake, could cost this bestselling author his career.
We have also heard that he owes his publisher a substantial amount of money."
I'm here to see the director!
Who may I announce?
You're not telling me that you work here and you don't know who I am?
Dávid Debreceni!
What's wrong?
Your book not on the school curriculum yet?
Hi!
I haven't seen you for ages.
How long exactly?
Since I caught you with a police woman, and you tried to tell me, that you had a childhood fixation with women in uniform.
Shit line!
- You can go up!
- Thank you.
Have to go.
I've got a date with a squad of riot police.
Thank you.
It was good to catch up!
I don't believe it.
Good morning!
This is for you.
Have you already read it?
You chucked his daughter, the old man freaked out and being as he owns half the media, he stirred things up a bit.
Great!
Did you know about this?
Has this got anything to do with you, Angi?
I am the only idiot left in Budapest who's still bothered about you.
So that would be a no.
Have you got somewhere to stay?
I've moved in with Beni.
- The computer geek?
- Yeah!
You know, does not like it very much, if it is calling him that.
Perhaps, he could help you.
Beni?
How?
Why lonely the women?
Oh, no.
I have misgivings!
Why lonely the women?
I don't know.
Possibly, because I may not be there everywhere?
Reader survey, fresh and crisp.
80 of the percentages of the publisher's readers increase.
And hold tight, more than 50% he lives without a lasting partnership.
I don't want to know what you are trying to say.
I want you to write a novel about these women.
The single metropolitan woman.
Why does she live alone?
Why are there so many singles in the city?
It's an inexhaustible topic.
Are you listening to me?
- Yeah, definitely.
- Where are all the lonely men?
Why can't they find each other?
Where does it all go wrong?
"10 Dates" That will be the title of the book.
You date 10 women in 10 days and each one at a different place.
You slyly switch your Dictaphone on and chat to them.
Be listening, very much annoys, he is what you do!
You'll talk to them about their lives about what they want about why they live alone and about men.
You just sit and listen, and then you go home and write it.
In your style.
One date, one story from a man's perspective, that's the point of the whole thing.
I never heard anything so stupid before in my life.
You've got two options, Sweetheart.
One...
You do the book, you earn praise and cash, ...and you pay off your debts.
You can work your way back into la dolce vita in a couple of weeks.
- Two?
- Two...
You remember the goose that laid the golden egg?
I can assure you that I've got better things to do than baby-sit you.
Yes?
Like what?
Go and tidy your room?
I'm not going to be living with my mother forever.
Don't be fooled.
I'm going to write a groundbreaking software.
I found a multinational company firm, and I take over the world hegemony.
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Sorry.
Take your hand off!
Listen!
I took you in and I feed you, but don't touch my spaceship.
My father gave me that.
Firstly, your mother took me in and she feeds me.
You still don't touch my Millennium Falcon!
Come here and let's get you registered.
What box should I tick?
Heterosexual?
We're in.
"Salsa date, cooking date, ski date.
English date, paintball date, biker date.
Astro date, veggie date.
Rapid date, sms date, rummy date.
Diet date, natural date." Oh, my God!
What the bloody hell is that?
And what should I write about you?
Ballsy boy from the backwaters is looking for a willing wench.
You're such a funny kid, Beni!
Yeah, and here's the first response.
Tomorrow at three, Oxygen Gym, you'll see me.
I'm just working on thighs and bum.
You see?
Yeah, you've got really lovely nails.
You manicurist is a real Michelangelo.
They make it hard to handle all these machines.
What's that?
What?
It's my mobile.
Brand new.
Come out at 200 thousand.
My fella's one cost more than that.
You telling me you've got a fella?
- Yeah.
- But you said on the net that...
Yes but he's gone away so I thought I'd give myself a bit of a break.
Oh, I see.
If he ever found out I was seeing someone else, he'd smack me one and then he'd smack the bloke one...
Feel how firm my bum is!
Hey?
Look, you're really pretty and attractive but I need to get to know your essence first.
Okay, know what?
Let's go up to my place, and I'll show you my essence.
Hey...
This... very intimate.
- Isn't it?
So eclectic.
- Yeah, eclectic.
You fancy a dip?
Yeah, shall we take a dip?
Climb in!
- I pee one.
- Good.
You, this not too bad.
May turn up to get used.
What does your fella deal with otherwise?
Is he a gold-digger?
So you want to chat?
I don't like chatting it makes me tired.
Really?
- What do you like doing?
- Watching TV.
- What do you like to watch?
- Daytime talk shows.
I was on one once when my fella smacked my ex-husband one.
You've been married before?
Four times.
- Haven't ever lived on your own?
- Oh, that must be so boring.
And haven't you got any ambitions?
I don't use those kinds of things.
I don't need them.
Me neither.
I was just asking.
Is there anything in your life you'd really like to succeed at?
I'd like to be in films.
My fella said he'd get me into porn.
I'd never do one with animals, and I'd have to think about S and M.
- Honeybunch!
- Lovey-dovey!
Who's that?
My fella.
I said he was coming!
No, you said he gone away for a while!
Hey, Merci, give your daddy a big, sloppy kiss.
Look, I can explain.
I just wanted to get an interview with your lovely wife about single women in Budapest.
- What women?
- The life of single women in Budapest but she asked me here...
- because she wanted to show me...
- That's what I mean!
Honeybunch!
Have you shown the gentleman the Vampire?
Not, is not needed, in that direction there is no need, really.
But really, we are people...
- And the Vampire is coming now?
- Hey, don't argue with him and he won't hurt you!
The Vampire!
V 216!
Top model!
Don't look, ask!
Are you Vacuum cleaner agent?
We prefer the term:
VCM.
Vacuum Cleaner Manager.
Why, what did you think?
- The same as you!
- All right!
The sun shines, the moon moons, not planning on writing about women soon.
Ask for anything, I do it with pleasure, my dear Angela, mercy, mercy!
Is Nóri in?
- I am asking you, sends in!
- No!
You want to put an inspector on me?
An editor to help you with your work!
- Oh, no!
- Oh, yes!
Dávid Debreceni, Nóra Angyal.
You worked together on "Bakelite" three whole years ago... and we all know that gave this company its greatest ever success.
Okay, it's an exaggeration to say that we did it together.
- Nóri just checked the spelling...
- We all of us know what Nóri did for that book.
Shall we just leave it at that?
Okay, so why don't you get her to write the whole thing?
If only I could!
But, we have advertised your sorry book for Book Week.
For the third time.
Our friend, David, has been working on a new book since yesterday.
It's a book that will undoubtedly turn his comfortable life on its head.
What has that got to do with me?
I want him to write the rotten book.
That's the most important thing.
And in the meantime I would be very happy if he would realize what a dickhead has become of that young hopeful
I took under my wing back then.
Hey, just carry on as if I wasn't here.
To cut a long story short, we need someone to hold his hand.
I've held it enough.
That's why ten days either way won't make a difference.
He trusts you.
Angi, we are not already together.
What would you say, if you had to hold your ex-husband's hand from tomorrow onwards?
I'd hold it, I guess.
Perhaps we'd fall in love again.
But you're different.
You're strong.
You're Nóra Angyal, the most sensible woman in the world, and your mind controls your heart.
Thanks.
They used to call her "Icicle" at kindergarten.
- You promised...
- I know I promised to let you go.
I release you.
This will be your last job for us and then you are as free as a bird.
You can be tanning your hide in Brussels, ten days from now.
- That's blackmail.
- Of course it's blackmail, but you'll get it over with soon enough.
So forget what happened between you three years ago, ...and behave like two adults.
Dávid dates and Nóri types and Angi gets a beautiful, little book in her hands for Book Week.
Have I made myself clear?
Of course.
Have I made myself understood?
Yes!
You're adults, you're pros, so get to work.
- You are very kind.
- There you go.
Do you like the children?
Of course.
I show something to you, right?
He my nephew, Peti.
He cute very much.
And he, Boldizsár.
- Do I bore it?
- No, No.
Far from it.
Please, the ordered mineral water.
Wow, it's good!
Knows it I had so many unfortunate dates already.
It's so blighter.
Really, do you date a lot?
- Five times a week.
- Five?
How long for?
- For eleven months.
- Jesus Christ!
You haven't found anyone suitable in all that time?
No one.
- You're perfect.
- That means I passed the test.
You're too perfect and that's what's suspicious.
Bingo!
You're gay!
You're joking, aren't you?
You touched my arm when you helped me to my seat.
Why did you do that?
- Oh, I don't know.
- You're not taking me seriously.
And I thought that your intentions were serious.
I thought you signed up because you wanted to find a partner.
- Quiet happiness.
Do you remember?
- Look, Dalma!
Let's just sit here and wait for your taxi and what happens just happens...
But then...
But what do you want now?
You want me to marry you after one dinner?
Exactly!
I knew!
You are just like all the rest of them.
Talk about quiet harbor!
She's a complete nutter.
Do not call it me, that this totally normal!
Angi, this not it!
Even more music, even fewer speeches.
Radio Danubius!
This is the Broken Hearts' Club on Radio Danubius.
This next number is for Chipmunk.
Hi, Meringue!
Good afternoon!
David Debreceni.
Apology, I did not understand her name.
Anna Karenina.
I know you're still mad with me.
I thought we could pretend, that... we were meeting for the first time.
Right?
And we could do this job in a professional manner.
What do you say?
Tolstoy, again?
Isn't life too short for things like that?
One day you're going regret you didn't read the classics.
It doesn't matter, you've read enough for both of us.
I only just survived yesterday.
The woman was totally insane.
I thought I was going to be killed on the spot.
You should ask for danger money.
The famous Nóri Angyal sarcasm.
I'll write a book about you one day.
Do you know what the title will be?
"The Girl Who Got Out of the Wrong Side of the Bed Every Morning".
Subtitle?
"I Know Everything About the Soul...
I Read it in a Book".
Right, I'm leaving.
Oh, okay.
Do you happen to have the cassettes with you?
Yes I do.
Look after them.
I suffered to get them.
Good!
And please, never call me, Meringue!
You used to like it.
I used to like Baby Daddy as well.
It's better if you stick to the simple, standard questions like "what job do you do?" or...
"what are the three most important things you'd say about yourself?"
- Get it, Casanova?
- What are you grinning at?
Still better than a peaceful harbor.
Hey, that stuff's dangerous.
You're going to have a load of horny women following you home.
It makes me shiver to think.
Hey, I'm up for it.
It might even do you some good.
Oh no, and the sanctity of my private life?
I only let certain people into my life.
Our next dater is a charming, young lady who has been here before.
Her name's Lenke.
Let's hear what she's got to say about herself.
My name's Lenke.
Understanding... oh, that's not it.
I'm looking for a likeminded, understanding, non-smoking, cheerful partner.
- I love you...
- What do you say?
I love reading, making friends, that's it.
...That's all!
- Thanks!
Thanks and let's give Lenke a hand.
- Thank You!
- Lenke, here's your badge.
Take your place on the girls' side.
Ouch, Lenke!
I can see three gents have arrived a little late and a couple of them are new.
- Girls!
- Hi!
Can the new boys please come up onto the stage?
What good-looking boys, and both single?
Yes, you know, today's girls are so...
But you've come to the best place.
Rapid dating will solve all your problems, and if today's date doesn't work out, the next session is free.
Introduce yourselves, boys.
Péter Pázmány.
Pál Pázmány.
Tells us something about yourself, Pál!
Okay.
Hi!
My name's Pál or Pali and I've already met my girlfriend on the internet.
She's a stewardess and we haven't met in person yet but we chat for about two hours a day.
- Really?
- Really.
You didn't say.
- Please?
- That's not why we're here.
- What's her name?
- Trinity.
- But here something...
- Trinity?
Lovely, traditional, Hungarian name.
If something should work out for me?
It was about time.
You're thirty and still a virgin.
I'm not a virgin!
I'm sorry!
No, I mean...
- I'm not technically a virgin.
- Good, good, thanks.
Thanks for that short and sweet introduction.
Let's give Pali a hand.
Here's your badge and please sit on the boys' side.
Please, tell us something about yourself, Péter.
Hello, my name's Péter.
I'm interested in all solutions.
I can see that the bloke at the back has had a Jacuzzi.
The Vampire sucks good, doesn't it?
Let's give Péter a hand.
Here's your badge, and go and sit in the boys' line, please.
Thanks for the introduction.
I'd just like to go through some of the rules for the newcomers.
Each date lasts for five minutes, and after five minutes we change partners.
When I say: "change".
So "change" and the gong like this.
You're not allowed to upset your partner with sexually sensitive topics.
Please stay polite and respectful.
Because we will have to expel anyone who breaks the rules.
Is everything clear?
Okay, then let's start!
Don't forget that there is a salsa party here, every Sunday.
- Hello, I'm Ramóna.
- Hi!
My boyfriend left me, because he said,
I didn't have my own opinion about anything.
Well I told him, that... really, really, I have to agree with him.
Ramóna...
Be waiting, only the chair...
I put on the chair...
Change!
What do you do?
- Hi, my name's Dalma.
- Hi, I'm Pali.
So, Pál.
I'm not really a dating type.
I don't have time for a serious relationship.
That's bad.
Change!
Change!
I like to read, go walking, to sing psalms, go walking, I've said that.
I'm a virgin.
What did you say?
I like reading, walk...
No, what did you say at the end?
Oh, I'm a virgin.
So you're interested in astrology?
You really are a virgin.
You remind me of my first girlfriend.
Was she a virgin too?
Yes.
She was on the first date.
- Okay, I'll move over.
- Wait!
You came to meet people, didn't you?
I'm looking for a husband.
And you came straight to a rapid date?
I thought it would be better to get it over with as soon as possible.
Of course, great idea, Lenke.
Others waste years and you get stuck straight in.
My parents have already found me someone.
He's a really good man, but his collar is always dandruff, and...
I don't like the way he kisses me.
I see.
Your parents don't know that you come here, do they?
Well, no.
I told them that I was going to a sewing circle.
I've been coming twice a week, but no one has wanted to date me yet.
Maybe you should take it one step at a time.
You can't attack a bloke on the first date with an offer of marriage.
This is my best birthday ever!
- What, Mum?
- Well...
You did think of me after all?
My little Beni!
Thank you!
You're welcome.
I'm going to try it.
What?
Okay.
So our friend, the second-class heartbreaker, now in possession of a major experience and a vacuum cleaner answering to the name of "Vampire", makes a fortunate escape while the appealing couple, both as his hosts and accomplished vacuum cleaner managers,
wave after him.
The moment had arrived when our hero realized that he had reached an important turning point in his life...
- He hurried to ask himself...
- Come in!
...whether or not false nails are an aesthetic issue a telltale sign or perhaps a character fault.
Hang on, what was that?
- What was what?
- You nearly smiled.
I'm in a good mood.
- Here.
- Thanks.
So can we start with a clean sheet?
Yes.
Sorry.
I was moody yesterday and the day before, but I just keep thinking about my trip.
Registering, packing, standing in line.
- Because you're really moving to Brussels?
- Yes.
And now what?
Nothing.
It's just odd.
It took you months to decide whether to move to the next street.
I've changed.
So much?
Three years is a long time.
You're the living proof of that.
When I met you, you were a very kind, sensitive bloke.
But ever since you've become a media personality...
And what are you going to do in Brussels?
I've been given a job in the department of culture.
Jesus, when did you get so serious?
When I realized it was time that I grew up.
You really have changed.
I leave on Saturday.
I wouldn't have normally taken work while,
I was moving but the truth is that I owe the company a tiny favor.
Ah!
She's blackmailing you as well?
But what about?
Did you break the coffee machine?
Sorry.
How are you getting on with the book?
Fine.
Do you like it?
Well, you did ask.
The "Ten dates" trick humiliates the single women living in the city whom it should speak to or talk about.
It's a cheap attempt to profit from the suffering of others.
The publisher is immoral, the writer's a chauvinist, and the editor will spit on her reflection until the day she dies.
But I really enjoyed myself, when I was typing it up.
Did you really buy that Hoover and where are you going today?
Where are you going today?
One-two-three-five-six-seven...
One-two-three-five-six-seven...
Great!
Smile everyone!
Bottoms moving, that's it!
I want to see all your teeth.
That's it!
The salsa is a Cuban dance.
A four-four dance.
It's about passion, emotion.
Great, watch!
The one in the white shirt in the second row, that's it...
Listen up!
Have you sweated enough yet?
Can't hear you!
Yes?
All choose a partner!
Okay!
Listen up!
One-two-three-five-six-seven.
Great!
Do it!
Very good!
Hello?
Hi, baby!
Shure.
Onto 11, I am at home.
Right, okay.
Bye!
Great!
Attention!
Look into each other's eyes.
Everything else disappears, you're just left with your partner's eyes.
That's it!
One-two-three five-six-seven.
Change partners!
Oh, fine!
- Do you know that you really look like someone?
- Who?
That charming writer.
Yes, don't.
He's just taller.
What's the problem?
Are you angry?
Yes, I'm really angry.
I'm outraged about by the fact that such a good women lives on her own.
Is there a problem?
Don't do that.
Don't provoke me, okay?
You're very naughty.
Have you ever been engaged?
Six times.
The last time was last year.
My mother reckons they based "Runaway Bride" on me.
I was eighteen, when my first boyfriend proposed.
I chucked him.
The next one was two years later.
Then there was an English businessman, Kevin.
The engagement was at Big Ben.
The bells played the wedding march.
A plane wrote "marry me" in the sky.
Really?
We broke up two weeks later.
And why do you always run away?
I'm frightened of getting attached?
I don't like thinking that my life has come to an end.
But let's forget it, okay?
Don't do that, because it'll drive me mad.
This is great, is it from the Matrix?
Yeah.
Are you a stewardess?
I prefer to be called a flight attendant.
I'm fine, Captain.
This is an emergency landing.
The nearest emergency exit...
Ah, hello!
I need your advice.
Seize the day.
No, something specific.
Why, isn't that specific enough?
I want to meet her.
Who with?
- The chat girl?
- Yes.
What did you say her name is?
- Trinity!
- Trinity.
- Like in "The Matrix"?
- And she loves Quimby like I do.
Hang on!
Listen!
Have you ever stopped to think what would happen if Trinity... didn't turn out to quite as sweet as she first seemed?
What?
An unbearable drunken bitch, who dragged a new man into her bed every night?
Ah, you mean just like you but a woman?
Hold on, did you need my advice or not?
- Was that your advice?
- Yeah!
Okay, okay.
Where have you been?
- In the city.
- With Nóri?
- Why?
- No, nothing.
She just phoned to suggest the three of us get together, this evening and go out somewhere.
Just like the good, old days.
We could.
Are you after her again?
Nóri?
No!
She's thrown me out once.
I'm not an stupid!
It's because you kept cheating on her and you couldn't sit on your arse.
And for just one night?
No ties?
Just one night.
Look You can always fit in a quick shag.
- With Nóri as well?
- With Nóri as well.
Okay, but be careful, you don't break her heart.
That's impossible, she hasn't got one.
Why is everyone in black?
- It's a long story.
- Are you into this music?
Of course.
I'm mad about them and I go to all their concerts.
- Hello, hi!
- And when you're not?
I'm a bag and a jewel maker.
Let's go somewhere quiet instead?
You can have a juice and we can chat.
Do not make a face.
Come, let us go to dance!
- You can't dance to this.
- Of course you can, come on!
I think Anna really deserves her fate.
How could she trust in the count for a single minute?
Because, she loved him.
Nóri, it is not possible for two people to love each other but you don't know that, because you haven't got a heart.
Ah, but I have got a heart, but I can control it with my mind.
Hey, Beni's right.
When was the last time you did something because it felt good?
Not because you should or because it was useful but because it felt good.
Okay, I'm going to Brussels, because it feels good.
Okay, but I wasn't thinking of something that trivial but something more important.
When did you do something crazy?
- Am I today's topic?
- Why, should it be me instead?
- Sorry!
- Thanks.
Okay, if I'm the topic...
I think we should try to achieve the best possible.
Just because one bloke is better than another, it doesn't mean that I have to go and jump into bed with him.
He has to be the best possible.
And how many "best possible" have you found after me?
That's private.
Okay, I just want to get to know more about women.
If I happen to be writing a book about them.
All three of us know, that you are only interested in women in one position.
Really?
That is interesting.
There are about nine for you.
Will you shut up?
You're just like your own parents.
Okay, let's listen to the head boy.
Thank you.
Love isn't about control.
- No?
- No.
- And it's not about mental manipulation.
- No?
No!
Love is about honest and open emotions.
And however many times it's been hurt, you have to open your heart up again and again.
Beni, how many joints have you smoked today?
What you said was beautiful.
You are not beautiful already.
What you said was beautiful.
Did you read it somewhere?
Okay, let's go!
- Okay, let's go.
- Aren't we staying?
- Let's stay!
- Then I'll stay too.
- Shall we go?
- Let's go!
Bye, Beni!
See you at home.
- Come on!
- Okay.
What's this?
A last adventure before Brussels?
You know, I hate crowds.
So, what happened was that there was this French novel, a load of rubbish, and Angi asked me to translate it into Hungarian and I did.
Only not on a courtly, like that, was expected from me.
- You rewrote it a bit?
- Yes.
The French publisher found out and sued us.
This is where the debt comes from.
And the blackmail.
- What?
- Nothing.
Simply...
Your wonky, little teeth.
So much I missed them.
- I missed you.
- Let's drop that.
And what have you been doing for the last three years?
Why isn't there a new book?
- Who's asking?
Angi?
- I'm asking.
Are you checking up on me?
Friendly curiosity.
Oh...
Are we friends?
I spent the first year advertising the book.
Giving interviews.
Appearing on the shopping channel.
I spent the second year resting.
The third year...
The third year just slipped by without me even noticing.
Did you try to write?
Of course, I tried, but somehow...
You blocked.
You panicked!
Yes.
You were frightened that whatever you wrote, ...it couldn't live up to "Bakelite".
You were frightened, that...
Your grave would bear the inscription:
"Dávid Debreceni, who wrote one book".
Well, really not too I would call it a fear.
But some kind of... for terror.
Something is expected of me... that I don't want to do... and that I don't think I will be able to achieve.
Familiar.
That was the problem with us too, wasn't it?
I wanted too much, and you kept backing off.
Do you think that sounds mad?
Why, do you think it does?
We shouldn't.
Never again.
But why not?
Because, I'm...
Because, I'm getting married next Sunday.
Nóri!
Who to?
- Is it a secret?
- Not important.
What's his name?
He must have a name.
Alex...
Alex Vronsky.
I'm leaving.
Good afternoon!
It's as if your thoughts are somewhere else.
No, I'm just thinking that it must be hard for you to find the right partner.
Just like you.
I can find a veggie easy enough, but I'm a tantric vegetarian, that tends to complicate matters.
I understand.
I mean I don't understand.
The tantra teaches that sex forms the basis of our whole being.
I have to agree.
But not just enjoyment, but a path to our higher selves, as a man's and woman's energies fuse in a kind of cosmic orgasm.
And this the...
Do you have cosmic orgasms on a regular basis?
Do you think I'd be sitting here if I did?
You're not a veggie are you?
Well, no, not really.
We could still give it a go, it might just work.
What?
A cosmic orgasm.
Wow...
I don't know.
It's a tempting offer... but... there's this girl...
Oh, my friend!
That's love.
Why are you sitting here like a fool?
The tantra teaches us to seize the day!
Here, it is!
Run!
And enjoy a cosmic orgasm.
Then call me and tell me what it was like.
Oh, and pay the bill!
Hi, Little Man!
- Hi!
- Have a sip of grass juice.
This is very choice!
- Jesus, did you really eat here?
- Just hay.
The straw hasn't arrived yet.
Why did I have to rush over here from the other side of town?
You said it was an emergency.
Where is it?
I can't see it.
Yesterday...
I strolled along the Danube with Nóri.
We are there!
No, it wasn't that sort of date.
- Did you kiss her?
- No!
I mean, yes, but it was a sibling kiss.
Siblings don't kiss.
She's marrying some Russian bloke, on Sunday?
So what's the problem?
Emergency solved.
What?
Doesn't he miss his dad?
Don't mention that idiotic swindler, because I'll go mad.
You still love him.
You know me, I like a challenge.
Do you know how much easier it would be to hate him?
I tried to... but then I remembered how he woke up in the morning with the creases of the pillow on his face.
And he had the inquisitive look of a child.
Perhaps I don't miss him just moments like that.
Listen, I'm not used to being asked questions.
You did not say that I may have a date, with strange women simply.
Well...
What number am I?
Hang on...
Six and a half.
Nice, round number.
And I guess I'm the only one who brought her kid along.
The only one.
And the prettiest.
And the cleverest.
More!
And the sweetest.
Well now I've cried all my makeup off, ...I'll go and fix it up.
I'll order one in a minute, okay?
You're not much of a chatterbox.
It's good talking to you.
Oh, my God!
This woman collapsed!
Call an ambulance!
How is she?
Panic attack.
She went to the bathroom and fainted.
I'm afraid it was my fault.
I didn't know she had a panic problem.
Neither did she.
What did you say to her?
It's not important now.
Good night.
- Thanks for looking after him.
- No problem.
- Well.
I'll...
- Yes?
- Bye.
- Bye.
- Hello, daddy!
- Meringue!
Well...
How are you?
What are you reading?
"Distant Shore".
- Give me that!
- I found it on the table.
- You never told me you write.
- Because I don't!
But this looks a lot like a novel...
- This is a very good novel at that.
- Do you like it?
Yes, a lot.
I've only flicked through, but I'd like to read it properly.
Okay?
There is one scene that I don't like.
Seriously, right at the end, it's slushy.
Rowing on the Danube?
It is just a bit too much.
That's why I haven't shown it to anyone.
Nóri!
You can't go to Brussels.
You'd be making the biggest mistake of your life.
You can't be stuck in an office.
You have to write it!
- This emerges from this much.
- Why are you doing this?
What?
Why are you wrapping me around your little finger?
So that you can get bored again and cheat on me?
Nóri!
How have we gone from a kiss to a cross-examination?
- Oh, is it one of those moments?
- What sort of moment?
When your mind controls your heart.
What do you want from me?
I want to prove to you that I'm the best.
The best possible.
Just trust me.
Will you try to trust me?
Yes.
Dad, cider vinegar would be needed!
Anyway good to watch, you are busy.
But why don't you do this at home?
Husband?
Kids?
That kind of thing?
No time at the minute.
Own company, lots of work, large projects.
So don't you come here to meet people?
Not really.
Perhaps, if someone should come along,
I wouldn't protest.
Fine.
That's right!
That's it!
Shit!
Good we walked back.
I'm hungry again.
- No!
- Yes!
- You don't want to work now, do you?
- Have to.
I'm behind.
Should I make the food we learned?
- Come on!
- Okay!
- Be waiting, I take this off, because I reek of the oil.
- Ok.
...this was compulsory landing.
Nearest one night?
With no ties?
Well, onto a night, be listening...
There's always time for a quick shag.
- With Nóri as well?
- With Nóri as well?
Okay, but be careful, you don't break her heart.
That's impossible, she hasn't got one.
No, Nóri, no!
Nóri, switch it off!
That's not what I meant.
I was just messing around with Beni.
Go away!
I'm such an idiot.
Just go.
Is it you?
Do you have any idea what time it is?
I don't give a shit!
Are you going to let me in?
Dávid, it's not the best time.
What do you mean it's not the best time?
I want to sleep, let me in!
Beni!
Who's that?
Beni!
- Is something wrong?
- No problem, Darling!
What are you doing here?
- Are you spying on me?
- I live here.
Do you know each other?
- No!
- No!
We just went dancing.
- I got a bit drunk.
- What?
- Bally.
- Yes, but somebody else did not happen.
What...
What did not happen?
A moment, from where do you know each other?
Beni and I, we are friends, kindergartener since our age.
You know, I supported him and he sticked to my neck.
Sorry.
What happened here accurately?
I was drunk.
I am sorry.
Nothing happened.
We slept simply.
Let me explain it.
You may hear it on the cassette!
Did you write she into it?
- Did you write Viki into it?
- What?
Did you record all?
What you talk about, let me understand it.
Dávid, writes a book, from the single women.
Right?
- That's right...
- Dávid Debreceni.
Thought that was you!
So, was because of your book, this all?
Did you make use of me?
- Viki!
- Viki!
- Why, not enough for you, for the world all of his women?
- Enough.
- Why is my woman needed?
- Not needed!
- Why do you always think you're the first?
- I don't think that!
- Let me say something.
- Get out of here, okay?
- Please!
- Get the hell out of here!
I have to get that cassette.
At who is the audiotape?
- At Nóri.
- Who the hell is Nóri?
Dávid's ex-lover.
She's his editor now.
They want to publish it without my agreement?
No, I shouldn't think so.
- Where does she live?
- Viki!
Write the address down here!
Don't know why I always have to ruin things that are good.
I'm cursed...
I'm crock.
This stupidity!
Hey!
I give up, I've had enough!
That's life!
I reckon men have a pain threshold much lower than women.
Some don't even have one at all.
Does it really hurt that much?
Only if I laugh.
- And what's that?
- What?
Nothing, just my mobile.
It's a Chinese, analogue Dictaphone.
Why did you bring it with you?
I'm a journalist and it got left in my pocket.
...have a pain threshold much lower than women.
Some don't even have one at all.
Does it really hurt that much?
- Only if I laugh.
- Good, I'll explain.
I'm listening.
I'm writing a book.
It's about single women in the city.
I date them and interview them.
Are you a writer?
Dávid Debreceni.
Listen here, Dávid Debreceni!
Have you ever heard about personal rights?
Yes... and I know that you're right.
But if I'd told you beforehand you wouldn't have been able to show your true self.
Would you like to know what it's like when I show my true self?
Yes.
Mr. Debreceni!
Vilmos, I'm not giving autographs now.
I saved your stuff, it's with me.
Thank you.
Come on, you can sort yourself out inside.
Don't worry, Kempelen is out.
Bakelite.
No!
Is it you?
Sure!
We were really big in the seventies.
- Can I put it on?
- Of course.
I used to go to sleep to that every night.
What's this?
It was the book that caught my eye first.
"Bakelite".
Then your name.
You started to interest me.
I read everything that they wrote about you.
I saw a picture of you as a child.
T was like looking at myself.
Then the papers had a go at your mother too.
Then I was sure.
Ilonka Debreceni.
I didn't know that she knew you.
She never talked about you.
We loved each other.
But we had our own separate lives.
Her life was ordered and predictable.
My life was full of touring, unpredictability and chaos.
And, of course, there were the women.
She couldn't deal with that and she dumped me.
I was so angry that I took a contract in Holland.
I didn't know she was pregnant.
Good.
If you had known, would it have changed anything?
Well, that's a hard one to answer now.
I don't want to tell a lie.
This track sounds terrible now.
It looks like I messed everything up.
I don't need a father.
I don't have one anymore.
You're too late.
I don't expect it from you.
But stay here now.
Let me help you.
Not as a father only than an old good acquaintance.
Then we'll see how it goes after that.
What should I call you?
How do you address an old good acquaintance, who turns out to be your father?
Let's stick with Vilmos for now.
Hi!
Hi!
Are you here about the ad?
Unfortunately, I rented out the flat already.
No, I want the cassettes.
You're Nóri, aren't you?
Are you're the new editor?
- Yes.
- I'll get them.
I was hoping, they'd send someone.
...Viktória, salsa date, attractive but burnt-out.
- Are you furious?
- Yes, I am very furious.
Shocks I said this already, I am virgin.
What you said...
Shit!
Zsuzsa Márton, the tantric sex goddess.
Sweet girl.
The tantra teaches us that sex forms the basis of our whole being.
I have to agree.
But, not merely indulgence...
They'll be no happy end to this story, Mate.
You're not going to get rich at our expense.
Waiter!
The WIFI's playing up.
Wi-Fi?
Sweet God!
Once, the people, shouted on the mountain how "I love you", and it was properly.
Now here these many gadget.
Teleport home, Jedi knight, ...and then do it from home, okay?
Hey, don't you know me?
Do you really not know me?
I'm the customer!
So a little more respect, please!
With respect, Doctor your server is full of beer.
It would be better if you go home, ...because someone has to be missing you.
I'm paying, so another drink for everybody.
Hi!
Beni, Viki, what happened?
The prodigal son returns.
What's this?
Girls, we still don't know each other!
My name is Viki and I asked you here, because there is something that connects us all a man who has underhandedly exploited us all.
Viki, is that why you asked me here?
No!
Hang on a second!
Let me introduce Dávid Debreceni.
The writer?
Péter Pázmány!
Isn't there anything you want to say?
Hi!
Yes... my name's Dávid Debreceni.
And I'd like to start with an admission.
I lied to everyone.
I dated in order to collect material for my next book,
And meanwhile unfortunately I fooled you.
Yes.
- Just how Viki said.
- It doesn't matter.
No one else mattered except me.
I wasn't bothered about what anyone thought or what anyone else wanted.
I wasn't even bothered about what you really wanted.
But you have to believe that I have changed and I can only thank the women I have talked to over the last ten days.
That's you.
And now, there is not something else back, since...
Let me ask for your apology.
Girls, you're all fantastic women!
You could all make any man happy.
I mean it.
But you're worth just as much without them and you don't need anything more than to know this.
Perhaps a bit of self-confidence.
And while I'm at it there is somebody yet, from who, I have to apologise yet.
Someone I hurt when I really didn't want to.
Beni!
You're my oldest friend.
I'm sorry, Mate.
No problem.
And don't take this the wrong way, but...
I love you.
I love you too.
Otherwise...
We with Viki, very once came term with.
Right?
And what about Nóri?
Are you going to let her go?
Gets married, something to Russian.
- Who's Nóri?
- What Russian?
- Sorry!
- I don't know.
Alex...
Alex Vronsky, I believe it.
- Alex Vronsky?
- Why, do you know him?
Is he in the Hoover business?
No, it's Count Vronsky from "Anna Karenina".
It's a book.
A Russian fella wrote it.
On the last week they failed on this in the telly, didn't you see it?
Tolstoy.
Tolstoy!
Tolstoy, of course!
Alex Vronsky, so there is no man in Brussels!
Viki, when does the Brussels flight leave?
Okay, okay, Nóri, bye!
Look after yourself and have a good trip!
Bye!
Hey, where is she?
She's not leaving for another hour, because she's still at home, waiting for her taxi.
- Good, that's good.
- Super!
Perhaps this is mad.
Thanks for being here with me.
So we need to synchronize our watches.
- Oh, no!
- I've been wanting to ask for ages.
Who's this?
Oh, you missed the family event.
Present it, my newborn father.
Okay, let us step onto the gas!
We've only got an hour.
Girls, let's have a drink!
That's the minimum.
But, we made such a beautiful couple.
Okay, I'll call you in exactly 45 minutes and put me on.
Good, Thanks.
Bye!
Keep your eyes on the road!
- For Miss Angyal, right?
- Yes, yes.
- Haven't you got any bags?
- No, I sent everything earlier.
We can go!
Hello!
- Good afternoon!
For Miss Angyal?
- Yes!
- Did I say terminal 2/B?
- Yes.
- Thank you.
...it's Danubius request show.
Even more music, even fewer speeches.
Shall we?
- Wait, Dávid!
Listen!
I host you immediately and you may start it then.
Just hang on!
Good, thanks!
Even more music, even fewer speeches.
Radio Danubius.
This is the club of the broken hearts and is here, the first phoning in.
He's Dávid and his voice might be familiar to a few people.
- You come, Dávid!
- Hello!
You believe it now, that you may get out simply, and you may fly away into Brussels.
No!
Believe it, I did not want it, that let this happen.
I did not want, you to be important again for me.
I was afraid of the emotions.
I was afraid of the responsibility...
But mostly from it, that I'm not enough good for you.
And soon or late, you realize this.
Once, it seems like a thousand years ago, you said that:
"I would miss not having read the classics."
I didn't believe you.
Remember?
I never thought the time would come when my life would be in Tolstoy's hands.
I did not take it to reason, that your confidence... with which second gave a present... the greatest thing, that a man may get from a woman.
I proved that I was a fool for a second time.
I lost you.
But I have finally realized, Meringue, how empty and aimless my life is without you.
Do you know it?
And I decided, I take a risk and I put my future into your hand.
Look, the time was pressing...
- Please.
- Thanks.
Onto a desperate step determined myself.
I had you kidnap, yes.
And now here compromise myself, ahead an all the world.
And I am willing to shout out to the world what I have never said to anyone before!
People!
Read Tolstoy before it's too late!
You still won't get put on the curriculum.
But at least you've earned Tolstoy great satisfaction.
- We heard of Dávid Debreceni.
- Guys!
The taxi's here.
Cockle-shell!
Nóri!
I love you!
What should I say to that?
Viki, right?
What would you do if a man declared his love for you... when you are just about to get on a plane to start a new life?
That's been happening to me every week until now.
Beni!
Would you really throw away your predictable and certain future for a crazy, blazing, but completely unpredictable love?
Yes.
You would believe it, for the world's largest womanizer, that changed?
Yes!
Yes.
- Come on!
- Nóri!
Wait!
Have a good trip!
Tanks.
Let me help.
Wait!
- This is yours.
- Thank you.
In the romantic films, the roses are being thrown at this time.
- Really?
- Yes.
You have all said that the end is slushy.
Okay, I made a mistake.
It looked slushy at the beginning.
But you lied about going to Brussels to marry a guy.
Because, I was frightened of you!
- Why?
- Why?
Think about it.
You said, that you were going to trust me.
You've made so many promises.
But you did not die of it, into a little lies.
Why do you throw all into it?
Do you know how much these roses cost?
Do not be mingy!
Ok, excuse me.
- Do you ask for strawberries?
- Yes, ask for!
You asked it, ask for this.
Then why do not give?
- Champagne?
- Good, let us drink champagne!
- Do you ask for a little champagne?
- Yes, I say it, that ask for!
Let us drink a little champagne.

NARRATOR:
On this combustible episode of "Mythbusters"...
Oh, that's pretty!
NARRATOR:...
Adam and Jamie try a little tenderness.
[ French accent ] Red meat and high explosives!
NARRATOR:
They're testing the myth that blasting the heck out of low-grade steak with high explosives makes it so much softer.
[ Normal voice ] That's awesome!
I love results!
NARRATOR:
Then Kari gets to torture Grant and Tory...
KARI:
I knew that we were gonna make him angry, but I didn't realize he'd be this angry.
NARRATOR:... to see if stressed-out drivers really do use more gas.
Where did those rats go?
!
I didn't know -- l-l really --
NARRATOR:
Who are the mythbusters?
Adam Savage...
Hail, people of Earth.
NARRATOR:
...and Jamie Hyneman.
Mush.
NARRATOR:
Between them, more than 30 years of special-effects experience.
These things are always catching on fire.
NARRATOR:
Joining them -
- Kari Byron...
I feel so sci-fi.
NARRATOR:
...Grant Imahara...
Warning, warning!
NARRATOR:
...and Tory Belleci.
All right, release the hound.
NARRATOR:
They don't just tell the myths.
They put them to the test.
Adam, I thought we talked about doing that while you're at work.
[ French accent ] Ha ha!
Oh, Jamie, mon frÃ¨re, you know, many fans have written to us over the years and said,
"Mythbusters, is a hammer the best way to tenderize my steak?"
Now thanks to a viewer submission, we may have a new technique, for we might replace this... avec this.
The question we'll be answering is --
Can you tenderize a steak with explosives?
[ Laughs evilly ]
Oh, it went out.
NARRATOR:
Over the years, we've used explosives to answer all sorts of vital questions.
Can they clear a clogged-up cement truck?
Can they help cushion a fall?
And can they make a surfable wave?
Now it's time to open the fridge on combustible condiments.
So, Adam, if we were using explosives on steaks, wouldn't it just blow up the steak?
I'm going to go without the accent now, okay?
-lt's too hard.
-Okay.
[ Normal voice ] No, it won't.
The technique we'll be testing involves putting the meat into a vacuum-sealed bag, putting that into a barrel of water, and then detonating a small amount of explosives in the water.
The theory is that the shock wave created by the explosive will actually tear apart microtissue fibers within the meat, rendering it a heck of a lot more tender.
NARRATOR:
A steak's tenderness depends very much on where it's cut from the cow.
Meat from the short ribs is super soft.
Meat from the neck and the rump -- not so squishy.
It's all due to the strength of the connective tissue between muscle fibers.
The weaker the tissue, the softer the meat.
Two common ways to break those bonds are powdered-pineapple enzymes and a sound thrashing.
But the fans want to see this third method thoroughly investigated.
If you're gonna tenderize meat with explosives, it's not like you're just gonna throw a stick of dynamite on the steak and expect it to work.
You've got to put it in water because the water is actually gonna transmit the pressure of the blast wave a lot more effectively.
And you also don't want to contaminate the meat.
You've got to seal it in something.
So we're gonna vacuum-bag this meat in some really tough plastic.
NARRATOR:
These crash-test steaks are all relatively low-grade select cuts.
So there's plenty of room for improvement.
They're sealed and delivered -- not to the kitchen, but the bomb range.
[ French accent ] By popular demand, today we are joining two of my favorite things -- red meat and high explosives!
[ Laughs ]
JAMIE:
What we're creating here is a shock wave that is traveling at supersonic speeds, and it is just ripping apart all those little fibers that make up the muscle of the meat -
- Hence, it's tender.
NARRATOR:
As to how much explosive they need -- well, they'll find that out by trial and error.
Tenderizing steak with explosives in 3... 2... 1...
ADAM:
Whoa!
JAMIE:
[ Laughs ]
Jamie, I think that was too much explosives.
NARRATOR:
Some chefs add too much salt.
Some go nuts with the garlic.
But Frank's added way too much C-4.
What can you say?
This recipe is just plain wrong.
Everything else is gone, but the steak is here...
Sort of.
NARRATOR:
So, while Adam and Jamie recalibrate, let's jump-start our second myth.
[ Growls ]
Aah!
Okay, I'm relaxed!
What does a shoulder massage have to do with fuel efficiency?
Well, according to this myth, the idea is that if you're driving and you're relaxed and you're happy, you'll save a lot more fuel than if you're angry and stressed out.
So, if you want save fuel, don't drive angry.
Precisely.
NARRATOR:
It's a widely accepted fact that bad driving habits like stopping and starting abruptly result in less fuel efficiency.
But could the simple act of driving stressed turn an otherwise careful motorist into a gas-guzzler?
You know, I really like the sound of this myth.
We get to relax, kick back, and then take a little drive.
You know, it's not gonna be all easy, though.
It sounds like we're gonna have to get stressed out, too.
In fact, I think it's gonna be dangerous.
So we're not gonna do this on the road.
We're gonna go to an abandoned neighborhood, and I'm gonna set up a course.
NARRATOR:
And this is the test track -- a once-thriving California suburb that someone pulled the plug on.
TORY:
This is Cypress Knolls.
It's an abandoned military-housing neighborhood, and the city of Marina has agreed to let us use it.
And there are plenty of neighborhood streets.
And we are gonna be tearing around these streets to see if you use more fuel when you drive stressed.
NARRATOR:
These streets haven't seen traffic for 15 years.
So for the test car, we've gone retro-rusty.
This is the car that we're gonna use for our test.
Now, it's pretty old and it doesn't get great gas mileage, but that doesn't matter.
What we're trying to test here is whether or not driving stressed out or driving calm has a difference on whether or not you use more fuel.
NARRATOR:
And to get a precise reading on fuel usage, they'll bypass the car's gas tank for a gas bag.
GRANT:
What we're doing is measuring the fuel before and after, but not by volume, but actually by weight so that it's more precise.
NARRATOR:
Now for a few practice laps, just to get a feel for the car and the old neighborhood.
All right, who goes first?
-BOTH:
Rochambeau.
-All right.
Dynamite.
[ Laughing ] There's no dynamite!
You're pointing at me.
That means I go first.
NARRATOR:
Kari's marked out a four-mile course that, like most racetracks, finally brings you back to where you started.
Grant's the first to try a test lap.
GPS:
Approaching playground on right.
Playground on the right, then turn left.
[ Engine turns over ]
NARRATOR:
Then Tory tries cruising the cul-de-sacs.
It's like a modern-day ghost town.
Turn left on Lindsay Street, then arrive at smashed computers.
All right, looking for smashed computers.
Does this GPS sound condescending, or is it just me?
Am I the only one that feels this way?
Turn right on 4th Avenue.
And I'm the sole survivor, searching -- searching for a lone survivor.
Hopefully, it's a female so I can start procreating.
NARRATOR:
That's enough of that, though it might surprise Tory to learn that a rather more wholesome fantasy awaits him just around the corner.
NARRATOR:
Home, home on the bomb range.
-ADAM:
Whoa!
-NARRATOR:
Adam and Jamie are testing a viewer myth that low-grade steaks can be tenderized with high explosives.
So far, it's a total bust.
ADAM:
Now we're gonna pull it back in the other direction and detonate what is essentially an extra-large firecracker full of aluminized black powder, which is a fairly low-speed explosive, as opposed to what we just used.
It requires a fuse to light it.
Now, getting a fuse to light into water is not undoable, but it's a little finicky.
NARRATOR:
Finicky for some, but for Jamie, it's just like shooting fish in a barrel.
That was a nice, little blast.
NARRATOR:
It sure was.
The bucket's destroyed.
But more importantly, how's the steak?
Well, that went perfect -- The explosion went off, and we didn't ruin our bag of meat.
Now, I can't tell anything specific just by touching this meat.
The proof in any improvement in texture is really gonna be in the cooking.
MAN:
1, 2, 3.
NARRATOR:
The bag's intact, so the steak's still good to eat.
Even better, they've tracked down someone at the Department of Agriculture who says he knows how to blast a steak to perfection.
And they say that we've got to put a steel plate at the bottom of the barrel, we have to suspend it in the air, and they gave us a precise amount of explosive we have to use.
So that's what we're gonna do.
[ French accent ] In a few minutes, we should have very tasty meat.
NARRATOR:
And just for the record, this one goes back to using high explosives.
So, we've done Baby Bear, and we've done Papa Bear.
This is Goldilocks, right?
This is the recommended recipe in 3.. .2... 1...
JAMIE:
Oh, look at that.
NARRATOR:
Boom time for fans of exploding meat.
And just like last time, the steak is...
ADAM:
Not breached!
NARRATOR:
And that means it's time to get cooking.
As the sun goes down, the barbie fires up.
So, let's meet the meat.
Now, the first one is a low-grade steak.
It's not been altered or tenderized in any way.
The second one is that same low-grade steak, but we tenderized it with a low explosive.
The third one we've tenderized with a high explosive.
And the fourth one we've tenderized with a pineapple-enzyme commercial preparation.
Now, the last one is a prime steak that's been aged 28 days.
We're gonna test all of these and see which one is the most tender.
NARRATOR:
And so as not to influence the results,
Adam adds a touch of color.
We have five different cuts of meat to cook and test.
Each of those cuts of meat has been assigned a color, which matches to these pans and our little taste-test bowls here.
NARRATOR:
To ensure there's no bias from the barbie, steak chef Joe Kohn cooks all five cuts just the same.
And another celebrity chef has been invited to dine in the dirt.
ADAM:
We're bringing in Ron Siegel, who's the chef at the Ritz-Carlton, and he is the only American ever to win
Japanese "Iron Chef" program.
Ron, thanks for coming on to help us out.
Thanks for coming out to the bomb range.
Thank you.
NARRATOR:
Let the chewing commence.
Steak's good.
Some of it is better than others.
[ Burps ]
I'm done.
NARRATOR:
So, drumroll, please.
[ Drumroll ]
Three different tasters and three totally different results.
For this myth to be true, the order should be red, yellow, blue, pink, then green.
But no one agreed on anything, and that's got Adam worried.
Even though we had five different samples here, the main thing we wanted to see was that the green -- the high-explosive tenderized meat -- would be rated higher than the red, our control.
And even though I did that, neither Ron nor Jamie felt like that.
So, right now, it's not looking that good for this myth.
Let's get back to the shop and crunch the numbers.
I'm cold.
All right.
Is there any more steak left?
[ Glugging ]
NARRATOR:
Here's a few simple rules for safe driving.
Don't do it drunk, distracted, or stressed.
Aside from the danger, driving under duress might add to your fuel bill.
And that's today's motoring myth.
Later on, we'll try to redline Grant and Tory's stress levels.
Oh, you suck!
NARRATOR:
But first, we need a nice, calm comparison test.
And Kari knows just how to put the boys into a mellow mood.
KARI:
Grant, for you, we have puppies.
Tory, for you, we have the director's cut of "Blade Runner"...
Yeah!
...and all your favorite desserts.
I don't want to leave.
KARI:
These are the fluffiest puppies we could find.
They're 8 weeks old.
TORY:
Gosh.
KARI:
Okay, I think we've found Grant's happy place.
[ Laughs ]
NARRATOR:
While Grant gets acquainted with his extra-fluffy puppies,
Tory slips next door for a pre-movie massage.
This is the best day of "Mythbusters" ever.
Tory's the first cab off this restricted rank with precisely 2,500 grams of gasoline.
Now, for the first of three nasty surprises, as he learns he's not alone out there.
Go, angry driver.
[ Horn honking ]
[ Laughing maniacally ]
KARI:
Good job, angry driver.
Awesome!
What was that guy's hurry?
Whew!
Cue slow driver.
Over.
Oh, look at this guy.
NARRATOR:
Kari's added these distractions to simulate a typically frustrating day on the road.
[ Laughs ] He's overtaking the slow driver.
Man...
That was annoying.
That doesn't seem very calm.
NARRATOR:
Now let's see the response to one very annoying pedestrian.
[ Laughs sarcastically ]
Aah...
There you go.
[ Thud ]
Nice San Francisco park.
I like the bumper bump.
That's why they call them "bumpers."
Okay, well, now I'm gonna weigh your fuel and see how much you've actually used up, and then we'll have
-something to compare.
-TORY:
Cool.
KARI:
So, Tory's used 924 grams of fuel.
Next step is to top this back off to exactly 2,500 and start the test again with Grant.
All right.
The birdie has flown the nest.
That means Grant's gone.
Do you make this stuff up, or is somebody writing it down for you?
[ Chuckles ] There's a writers' strike in my head.
[ Horn honking ]
Approaching the bush on right.
uhen turn right.
GRANT:
[ Laughing ]
KARI:
Okay, that's angry driver.
Can you hear him honking?
TORY:
Oh, I can hear him honking.
NARRATOR:
Grant takes both the angry...
[ Engine revs ] ...and the slow drivers in his sedate stride.
[ Laughing ]
NARRATOR:
He's been told to stick to a safe speed, and that's no problem at all.
That... is... funny.
NARRATOR:
Now for the parallel park.
Grant's so relaxed, it takes him a minute to find his inner rage.
TORY:
This is attempt number 9.
Ohh.
This isn't fair!
Now you're starting to [bleep] me off.
-TORY:
See, it's getting -- -[ Crash ]
Ohh, yeah!
That -
- That was real smooth!
[ Thud ]
There you go!
NARRATOR:
Kari weighs Grant's remaining gasoline and comes up with a figure she wasn't expecting.
All right, Grant used 1 ,053 grams, which is actually quite a bit more than Tory.
But that's not what's important here.
They are testing against themselves.
So what is important is how much they use in their calm test versus how much they use in their stressed test.
NARRATOR:
And how exactly does one go about turning two very relaxed dudes into quivering wrecks?
Ooh, this is gonna be fun.
We're about to find out.
All right, guys, we know one of the most stressful things about driving is having to go to the bathroom and not being able to.
Sweet.
You're gonna have to drink caffeine all day, and the potty's off-limits.
NARRATOR:
Here's the exploding-steak story so far.
Adam, Jamie, and one of America's best chefs can't agree on which steak is more tender -- the prime cut, the one sprinkled with pineapple enzymes, or those we've blasted to hell and back.
I don't know what to do with this one.
I'm dumbfounded.
We clearly have too many variables in the mix because we could run this test a dozen more times, and I don't think we'd come up with results that agreed with each other.
Yeah, I think having humans involved is the problem.
We need to have a mechanical, purely objective test.
And, for that matter, I was thinking about it, and there have got to be a lot of other ways that we can tenderize meat.
Like what?
What say we fire it out of a cannon at a steel plate?
That ought to tenderize it.
[ Laughs ]
I love it!
Let's do it.
NARRATOR:
Jamie's got the plan, the hardware, and the real estate to build a cannon as long as a four-story building is high.
As a tenderizer, it's total overkill, and that's why we're doing it.
Today's target is simply meant to stop the steak cold.
uhat is our target.
It's a toughened steel plate Jamie calls the flower of death.
Now, this is going to be a very sturdy catching device for our steak tenderizing.
We're going to be shooting a Kevlar burrito full of meat at it.
And hopefully, this will help prevent it from just spraying all over the room.
NARRATOR:
To get a fair comparison between unmodified meat and "cannon con carne,"
Adam's cut each steak in two.
One half gets blasted, and the other control cut doesn't.
So, your very rational question might be, why go through all the trouble to make every steak its own control?
See the white parts here?
That's marbleization.
That's fat and connective tissue.
Now, while a good portion of this makes the steak delicious, it also makes it inconsistent.
That's why we're going steak to steak.
Every single steak is tested against itself for evidence of improvement.
NARRATOR:
That testing will eventually be done by a highly sophisticated machine that promises indisputable results.
Meantime, we've got some steaks to shoot.
The four-cylinder air-pressure charge is set, and Jamie estimates the potential velocity at over 400 miles per hour.
Tenderizing meat when you're ready.
In 3.. .2... 1.
ADAM:
Oh, shoot.
[ Laughs ]
Well, this is actually through the other side.
There's your problem.
[ Laughs ]
Some meat-soaked Kevlar on the other side.
This is only part of it.
I'm -
- I'm missing some.
ADAM:
[ Laughs ]
NARRATOR:
I think it seems prudent to recalibrate the pressure.
ADAM:
What's the PSI you want to go to?
I'm backing it down a third to 100 PSI.
It's not gonna make a single bit of difference.
I'm gonna bet you that it's not gonna make a single --
It's gonna obliterate it.
-You want to bet?
-No.
$20 -
- I got -- I got 20 bucks.
20 bucks?
Anyone want to give me some action?
NARRATOR:
But Jamie made this cannon, and, hey, let's not forget who runs the joint.
So he calls the shots.
Totally not gonna work.
JAMIE:
This time, we're using four times the Kevlar.
We've backed off the pressure about a third to 100 PSI.
We'll see what happens.
Firing in 3.. .2... 1.
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
Well, there's the outer layer.
[ Chuckles ] That's hard on that thing.
ADAM:
Here's the inner layer.
-Oh.
Oh!
Oh!
-NARRATOR:
Once again, this New York strip's been less tenderized than pulverized.
But there is hope amongst the carnage.
Here's its other half -- unmodified.
I'm gonna cook both of these, freeze them again, test them, and see if there's any improvement.
NARRATOR:
First off, both cuts are cooked precisely.
ADAM:
So, the magic temperature here is 70 degrees Celsius.
When it's 70 degrees at the middle of the steak,
I've reached the USDA standard for cooking a steak for testing.
NARRATOR:
Once they're cooked, the steaks need to be cooled to 4 degrees Celsius.
Modified cooked.
Here's another steak for you, Jamie.
NARRATOR:
Adam needs more than one sample, and Jamie's happy to fill the order.
Firing in 3.. .2... 1.
NARRATOR:
At 340 miles per hour, it looks like we finally found our range.
It's totally intact.
NARRATOR:
It's almost enough to inspire yet another change of career.
I can see it now.
I start a restaurant.
It's Jamie's cannon-fired steak.
You place your order, and then a few seconds later, there's this big whoosh!
NARRATOR:
There are several simple ways to tenderize a substandard steak.
But we want to find a way that's both effective and, well, unexpected.
For those with limited access to high explosives or 40-foot cannons, turn left at the kitchen and head for the laundry.
So, the first thing I thought of was a dryer because, you know, it's that kind of motion, and if you put a steak or anything you want to tenderize in there, sooner or later, it's got to loosen all those fibers up
and make it nice and tender.
NARRATOR:
Sounds straightforward.
But to make it work, the dryer needs some, uh, modifications.
JAMIE:
Okay, so, that's the slit right there.
If we put that over that thing.
[ Chuckles ] This is dry ice, and this is gonna pour down into our dryer and hopefully keep the meat cold while it gets tumbled.
Yeah, let's do it.
NARRATOR:
And to keep the meat company, a generous helping of tenderizing ball bearings.
To the chagrin of our sound guy, we're throwing it in the dryer -- a whole bunch of them -- and see that what that does to the meat overnight.
[ Loud clattering ]
ADAM:
[ Laughs ]
[ Talking loudly ] So far, my neighbors think it's cool to be next to the "Mythbusters."
That could change.
[ Clattering continues ]
NARRATOR:
Next morning, the dryer should still be running.
Uh, but it's not.
-ADAM:
Did you turn it off?
-JAMIE:
I didn't turn it off.
I didn't turn it off.
That's not a good sign.
[ Laughing ] This is the color of the plastic bags that were in there.
[ Laughs ]
JAMIE:
It still kind of turns, but...
ADAM:
Something got messed up.
I think we might have burned out the motor.
How many did we put in there, four?
ADAM:
Four.
JAMIE:
Four went in, and two sort of came out.
ADAM:
[ Laughs ]
NARRATOR:
Adam now has a fridge full of tumbled and blasted meat to test for tenderness.
And he's got the perfect machine for an impartial appraisal.
Starting from the bottom up, we've got a plate in here, which the meat is placed on.
It's got a slot in it exactly the width that the USDA specs the slot in their machines should be.
Above that is a blade that is exactly the angle the USDA says it should be.
Above the blade is a pressure gauge, which, as the blade pushes through the meat, will read exactly the number of pounds of force required to push through that meat.
And what's pushing this down at a constant speed but a linear actuator, which I will power with a power supply.
This is exactly the way the government tests the tenderness of meat.
It ought to be good enough for us.
Oh!
Wow!
NARRATOR:
Tory, Kari, and Grant are testing the myth that your mood affects your mileage.
The boys have already run the course in a state of supreme serenity.
[ Horn honking, Tory laughs ]
[ Laughs ]
NARRATOR:
Now Kari has two short hours to turn these angels into deranged, distracted motorists.
Drink that.
Come on, come on.
We're on a time limit.
Seriously.
So, I've had nearly a liter of caffeinated energy drink.
TORY:
Kari informed us we're not allowed to go to the bathroom from this point on.
And it's the thought that I can't go to the bathroom anymore that's starting to stress me out.
If you got to go to the bathroom, you got to go to the bathroom.
NARRATOR:
But needing to tinkle in traffic might be the least of their problems.
In each of your drinks this morning, I put one of these.
That's why I took it from the car and you got them already opened.
TORY:
Yes!
Is it a laxative?
KARI:
This is a laxative.
-Oh, you suck!
-Yes!
Payback's a -- You know what it is.
You've got a few hours left, so enjoy.
NARRATOR:
Pumped full of jumping juice, the boys are getting real antsy.
You mother -- [ Grunts ]
I'm not stressed!
I'm totally fine!
NARRATOR:
Kari responds by hemming them in.
KARI:
This is your permissible area.
You cannot leave this area, sit in this area, or lay in this area.
You must stand within the lines.
No, I'm not going in the circle.
You can't keep me in the circle.
Man, if we had a football, we could be, like, chucking the football.
Whoo!
Let's pretend like we got one.
Catch it!
Yeah!
He can't even catch it with his imagination.
[ Laughs ]
NARRATOR:
Leaving the boys on a slow simmer,
Kari sets about reverse-pimping their ride.
I have got so much stuff I'm really excited about.
I've got stink bombs that smell like sulfur, so they basically smell like flatulence.
Those are going to go in my scent-orator.
I've got some gross, slimy stuff that goes on the dashboard.
They won't know what it it is.
It looks like guts.
I've got stressful noises I'm going to put in the CD player.
I've got a seat cover that is filled with golf balls, so it's sticking in your back.
And the seat's gonna be at an uncomfortable angle.
I think I might make it wet.
And then the steering wheel's gonna be sticky because I'm gonna cover it in cola and then, like, gross melted candy bars.
So it'll not only be sticky but kind of slimy, and it'll just be, like, brown crap all over your hands.
NARRATOR:
All this suffering is in the name of science, to see if the boys use any more gas when they've got their dander up.
Good news is you guys get to leave the circles.
No, I like my circle.
The bad news is it's not necessarily gonna be any better.
-Are you ready?
-[ Laughs ]
The anti-spa!
Come on in.
-MATT:
Howdy!
-TORY:
Oh, my God.
MATT:
Come on in!
Welcome to Mad Matt's Man Massage right here in the break-your-back shack.
I'm over this experiment.
How about you?
-Get on the table!
-TORY:
Is this gonna hurt?
MATT:
Well, it depends on how you define "hurt."
NARRATOR:
While Tory gets pummeled...
[ Groans ]
NARRATOR:...
Kari takes Grant to his own personal hell.
This has nothing to do with driving.
It's nothing to do with fuel efficiency.
This is all about torture.
Grant's torture is a goldfish foot bath, guaranteed to send his stress levels through the roof.
GRANT:
The problem is that I really don't like any fish touching me.
It's just something -- It's a phobia that I have.
Aah!
Now for our final stress-inducing condition.
There are two live rats in this box.
The reason we chose rats instead of, say, snakes or spiders, is because rats are self-aware.
They're not gonna run under the pedals.
NARRATOR:
And the first angry man to slide his baleful butt behind the wheel is Tory.
-Are you feeling stressed?
-A little.
-Are you feeling angry?
-Yeah.
NARRATOR:
Kari adds the rodents, and this stinking, sticky rat trap is ready to roll.
TORY:
Buckle your seat belts, little fellas.
We're going for a ride.
[ Horns blaring ]
KARI:
I would say he's sufficiently angry.
NARRATOR:
There's no mistaking the look on his face, but he is driving within the speed limit and at least trying to stick to the traffic rules.
Adding to his frustration, the racket from the CD means Tory can't hear the GPS.
-TORY:
You're not talking to me!
-[ Sirens wailing, buzzing ]
KARI:
Uh, Tory's actually skipping the course.
NARRATOR:
He's totally missed a turn and now the slow driver gets burned off.
[ Beeping, blaring ]
It worked.
You guys got me [bleep]
You guys definitely did a great job.
I knew that we were gonna make him angry and stressed out, but I didn't realize he'd be this angry.
NARRATOR:
Back on the H.Q. hilltop, they're all standing way back from the curb.
[ Blaring continues ]
KARI:
Wow, significant amount of stress, he still does a great parking job.
Well, I definitely saw a difference in the way I drove -- calm versus stressed out.
I think he's used more gas, but he did a third less of the course,
which is kind of crazy.
We've got 1 ,089.
You were so stressed out that you actually missed pretty much a third of the course.
You went right by it.
-I did?
-Mm-hmm.
But you can't hear that GPS.
-You still used more gas.
-Are you serious?
Shorter amount of time --
Your crazy driving that made me fear for your life actually made you use about a third more gas.
That is incredible.
NARRATOR:
Time for Kari to top up the tank and fetch Grant from the torture tent.
-How was the fish?
-Really sucky.
Why are you walking funny?
I might have to go to the bathroom.
NARRATOR:
And you've got to figure that a man who gets spooked by ornamental fish will not be a rat lover.
-KARI:
One more thing.
-GRANT: [ Laughs ] No!
KARI:
There are two little live rats that are gonna go for the ride with you.
NARRATOR:
Kari's turned a puppy kisser into a moving violation.
[ Beeping ]
This time around, Grant's demeanor is less demure.
[ Horn honking ]
KARI:
Aw, crap!
Grant almost missed the turn.
NARRATOR:
Just like Tory,
Grant finds himself accelerating and braking much harder this time around.
And his steering's not nearly as smooth.
[ Siren blaring ]
Where did those rats go?
!
Where did you go?
!
Hey!
KARI:
Crosswalker in position.
WOMAN:
Crosswalker is ready.
[ Tires screech, engine revs ]
NARRATOR:
Thankfully Grant's at the end of his run.
KARI:
Actually...
TORY:
He's doing better parking stressed out.
[ Grunting ] That's it!
That's it!
That's it!
NARRATOR:
At least he ran the full course.
And Kari's in no doubt that angry Grant used more juice than his calm counterpart.
KARI:
Grant has 826 grams left, which means he used 1 ,674 grams.
Last time he used 1 ,053 grams.
NARRATOR:
Grant's also used a third more fuel than on his calm drive.
The lesson is clear -- drive under stress, and it will cost you.
You both used a significant amount of fuel more when you were stressed than when you were relaxed.
Yeah, that seemed pretty obvious.
[ Chuckling ] Yeah.
Yeah, well, now we have the results to back it up.
Well, that's cool.
This one's confirmed.
Confirmed.
By the way, how are your stomachs doing?
That wasn't laxative.
That was, um, a vitamin.
So you should be okay.
[ Laughs ]
Placebo effect!
Are you kidding me?
!
I'm gonna kill you!
Number one.
ADAM:
Number one.
NARRATOR:
Back in our cowpoke kitchen, the boys are ready to test the cannon-fired meat for tenderness.
Each steak from each test is numbered so they can match those figures with the unblasted control halves.
2.5.
2. 1.
2.4.
[ Laughs ]
Dude, you know, the readings are...
[ Pops ] ...looking pretty consistent here.
NARRATOR:
Now to test those modified meat missiles.
ADAM:
Here's your moment of truth, Jamie.
Air-cannon testing.
[ Machine whirring ]
No, nothing -- 0.0.
that could mean it's so tender it just fell apart, but let's try a second one.
NARRATOR:
Test after test shows their "cannon con carne"
is way softer than the steaks that sat this one out.
0.7.
Dude, the averages are in.
The controlled steaks were averaging a tenderness of about 1 .33.
The post-cannon-fired steaks -- average tenderness of about 0.4 pounds.
That's pretty tender.
There's a clear, clear improvement.
[ Laughs ]
It just takes a 40-foot air cannon.
Yeah, and about 50 bucks' worth of Kevlar.
[ Both laugh ]
[ Loud clattering ]
NARRATOR:
Now for that marbled mess that totaled the tumble dryer.
All right, this is the ball bearings.
[ Laughs ]
And this steak -- who knows what we're gonna get out of this?
NARRATOR:
The very first slice sets the standard.
Zero.
And that seems like an honest zero to me, man.
This...
There's, like, nothing here.
NARRATOR:
And that calls for one more reading.
ADAM:
Total zero.
That looks like it's falling apart in your hands.
But it does still look like meat.
It's not like it looks like hamburger.
So, this definitely showed some significant improvement, although the process itself also needs a little improvement.
Steak in a dryer with ball bearings actually did really tenderize the meat.
Of course, there were problems, because, it, like, tenderized the dryer itself, and it fell apart.
But if you get over that, you've got a tender steak.
NARRATOR:
Two positive results confirming that meat really does benefit from a bashing.
Now that they found a reliable way to test for tenderness, it's back to the bomb range to bring this one home.
We began to look for, what's an empirical, nonsubjective test?
And we went right to the USDA's testing procedures for grading meat.
2.5.
2. 1.
So, we are following all of their guidelines now with all of our steaks in order to gauge their tenderness.
NARRATOR:
Adam and Jamie shape a lump of C-4 to the size of a pool ball.
They add a fuse, then wrap it inside a plastic glove.
There it is -- the blue hand of death.
-Works for me.
-Let's put it in.
NARRATOR:
Following strict instructions, this handful of high explosive is dangled and secured a foot below the surface.
Well, there it is.
Let's blow it up.
Okay.
NARRATOR:
The crane's deployed, and the boys retreat to the bunker.
-Are we set?
-I think we're set.
Tenderizing meat with high explosives in 3.. .2... 1.
Oh, that's pretty!
That's great!
This one's breached.
I can see that, but these two are totally intact.
That's fantastic!
JAMIE:
And even that one looks like a usable sample.
ADAM:
Yeah, completely.
NARRATOR:
Back at M5,
Adam scrapes down the hot plate for the last time.
But Jamie's on tenterhooks.
So, what, does it feel any different?
Like, tender?
It doesn't feel that different.
All right, sample number 16.
NARRATOR:
This final test should make or break the myth of tenderizing meat with high explosives.
70 degrees Celsius.
NARRATOR:
After a quick chill, the unmodified meat is cored and sliced.
2.3.
[ British accent ] Nothing to sully our science.
[ Normal voice ] I'm getting good at this.
2.9.
All right, that's pretty good.
Let's just call that, and let's do the exploded ones.
NARRATOR:
We're moments away from finding out if a high-powered shock wave through water really can make steak more digestible.
1 .8.
NARRATOR:
And this time, thanks to modern mechanics, it's not personal.
ADAM:
Another zero.
These two zeroes are accurate.
There's nothing here.
I mean, this is -- If you take a look at it...
JAMIE:
I would say so.
It's going towards the direction of the cannon or the ball bearing.
I think I know the results.
Tell me what the averages are.
Control was 2.82, and the exploded steak was 1. 16.
oh, that's so great!
[ Laughs ]
I'm exhausted -
- All of this protocol to build the machine and to have it actually give us results...
We were hoping to see something, and we got something.
Yeah, when you're chewing on it, you can't tell, but the machine won't lie.
That's awesome.
That's awesome!
I love results!
Don't we all?
And against all expectations, it seems blasting a steak to kingdom come really does make it melt in the mouth.
Our core sampling from both the control and the exploded steaks is totally conclusive.
The high explosives absolutely have a marked effect on the tenderness of the steaks.
Tenderizing steak with explosives -
- It works.
What did you bring for us?
Did you see this monkey?
Monkey?
It's seems to be normal, but it's not.
He has developed strange abilities.
He builds huts like them.
Females use weird stuff to accommodate his fur.
They make twisted ropes like that.
What's this?
21.
I don't know.
I don't know, I swear.
Almost Angels 2nd Season Episode 1
- Without Cielo
Okay, where did you find the monkey?
Fifty.
Thirty.
No, no.
Alright, it will be fifty.
Everything that I have is fifty.
Take it.
Perfect.
Ask him where he found it.
- He is saying that way.
- Get the boats ready!
Alright.
What are you doing here?
How did you get here?
You shouldn't be here, you should have to be at home, in the mansion.
- What are you doing here?
- I didn't want to stay at the mansion, it's boring.
I told you for a thousand times that you mustn't come with me.
Come!
Come here!
Listen to me!
I need ropes, to rescue Cristobal.
I need them, I'm close to find Cristobal.
Help!
Hold on!
I'm coming!
It's over.
She'll be fine.
Let me handle this.
Thank you, Mat.
Thank you for saving me, Mat.
'Summer Camp'
- Thank you very much, Tachito!
- It's nothing!
- The truth is that you're very good-looking.
- Yes, yes, but you haven't finished yet.
No, no.
Let me to work with machines.
Well, no.
Nobody is speaking about work.
Look what I have here.
We need to rehearse dance.
- Rama!
- Wait, wait!
Carefully, babe!
What are you doing?
Haven't you realized that you almost hit me?
Forgive me I got hit by a stone and...
I don't know...
I know that you don't know how to drive, but you almost killed me.
Do you want to kill me?
- No.
- No?
Don't you want to kill me?
I want to kill you!
Wait, wait...with the seven.
- Come on seven by seven.
- Don't make me nervous!
- Seven by seven!
- 42.
- 49.
- Mar, forgive me!
- Forgive me, it wasn't intentional!
- Start to run!
Because I'll kill you!
Seven by seven to say hi!
Come here!
I'll kill you!
Come here!
What happened?
Where have you gone?
We told you to wait a moment!
Last opportunity!
Isn't she beautiful?
Brenda.
Well, well.
I need practise, because it's not so easy.
Ugh, again!
It can't be.
Well, well, easy, easy...
On the right and up is Luli.
Wrong.
It's Brenda.
And what do you think?
Stunning, beautiful, marvelous.
Well, well.
It's like having a doll house.
You are telling me that because you love me, nothing more.
No, I love you so I'm not lying.
Don't change one thing for another.
It's amazing, so many details, how many things.
It's like having a dream house.
- Sorry.
- No, why sorry?
On the contrary, my love.
Above all, I love these colors.
They are already here on my palette.
Hopefully...
Feli, while the girls are not yet here, can we sleep in their room?
Yes, of course yes.
But don't move anything it's still under process.
Don't move anything.
Has Nico returned?
Has he found Cristobal?
- Attention guys!
- Now?
Let me go!
Come on, let's go!
Meeting at the beach!
Listen to me, let's go!
No, wait, wait!
Come on, everybody here!
Come on, quickly!
- We'll start now!
- Come on, let's start it!
- Hey, hey!
And Thiago?
- He is with the girls.
- Where?
- What?
- With who?
- Who?
Thiago.
No, he likes to say...
- That...
- Thiago is coming.
Come on, Thiago.
- Aloha.
- Ciao.
How beautiful you are!
Where were you?
I had a meeting.
And those marks?
They are from a... cream.
You, to ask you, what were you doing?
I...
I was studying to the exams with German.
And why are you so perspired?
Because the weather is hot.
Why are you wet?
Because I was in the water, because of the heat.
No, no.
You're four fools, why don't you just say out loud what you want and to be together like before?
Shut up!
Are you crazy?
What?
!
No way!
Don't be foolish!
Alright, alright...
We are free, just like you, bro.
Alright, perfect, I'm free I'm enjoying my solitude, I've nothing to be jealous about, to reclaim, to...
Well, well.
Now that every guy is here!
And girl!
I will tell you that the Team Orange has 420 points!
Come on Orange!
The Team Green also has 420 points!
Come on!
That means you've to compete...
Guys, guys!
Get ready, because the final challenge will start soon...
- Wow, it's beautiful Cielo.
- Do you like it, my love?
I'm happy for you, but you don't seem to be that satisfied.
- Is it, because they are in the jungle?
- Yes, I'm worried because of Cristobal.
- But I miss you more.
- I'm here, dear.
Yes, I know that you're here.
- With who is she speaking with?
- Poor girl.
My little sunshine.
Do you want to eat snacks?
Yeah.
Then, go to the bar.
I'm sure that the guys from the street are already there.
- Is Rama called me?
- Yes.
Yes...
No.
But I told you to relax, they'll return home.
Go, go.
- I was speaking with Cielo.
- Very well.
She said that she talked with Cielo.
Yes, my poor soul.
She can't get over that Cielo is not there anymore.
But what happened with Cielo?
Why does is nobody speaking about her?
Because... because... it's a mystery.
Because it's a... it's a secret.
Because... because...
Ay!
It's beautiful what you made from the house on the lake!
- Do you like it?
- I love it!
- I made it for you.
- You're too good, Bueno.
Attention guys!
There's five torches like these and the last torch is hidden.
The team who finds it will win.
Prepare yourselves!
Come on, prepare yourselves.
Good luck for everyone.
To the start line!
Let's go until the end!
- Are you alright?
- Now that you hold me, I'm even better.
Jazmin!
Jazmin!
Come on!
I kill you!
Go, go, run!
Go, go!
Quicker!
Come on!
Come on, Thiago!
Go, go!
Girls, girls!
- Girls, that's a draw!
- No!
It's a draw!
So we will decide it with a music competition.
- I was thinking...
- Be nice, I've to go.
- Feli?
- Yes?
- Has my brother called?
- Yes.
No...
Sweetie I don't know how to lie.
I told you to relax, they're fine.
Okay?
Pauliti, will you look after them?
Thank you!
Alright, I will visit my cousin, then I'll be back, okay?
- To Tina?
- She doesn't deserve it!
- Sorry, Luz!
- It's alright!
If she's asking about me, tell her that I'm fine.
- Ay, my love!
- But to never send me letters, because I won't read them.
- Okay.
- I still don't understand why are you visiting her.
- She's really evil.
- Look, my little beloved ones, who don't understand it...
There's no person in the universe who doesn't deserve a chance.
And I think that Tinita just like us, has something good inside her heart, okay?
- Yes?
- Kiss the aunt.
Kiss the aunt.
Kiss the aunt.
Ciao.
Be good.
- Beauty, beauty!
- Oh, that's me!
Who else would it be?
Come!
We finished for today.
Tomorrow we'll do the last smoothing, and it's done.
That's amazing, Bueno.
Thank you.
You're a real soul.
Still, don't you want to do some restoration on the clock?
Ah yes...
No!
No, Doctor Bauer doesn't want changes there.
But it could look a bit better, without changing anything on it.
What is it there?
Let's make it clear, Bueno.
That room is untouchable.
- You can't even go inside there, is it clear?
- Yes.
Kiss the girlfriend.
Hi?
Doctor Bauer?
Hi!
Do you hear me well?
Yes, yes, I hear you, Doctor Bauer.
How's the portal?
I mean the clock?
Good, good.
We're making infra-red images.
There's no electromagnetic variety, we can't solve these vibrations.
I already know that.
Did you contact me just to repeat it?
Yes, but we don't know what else we can do, Doctor Bauer.
Okay.
I've an idea, try to test it at night.
That's why I'm paying for you.
I'll pay twice as much, but please don't tell many people about it.
Yes.
Relax, we will return here, until we find a solution.
The monkey peed on me, Nico.
I have to put it down.
Feli and the guys, are they home?
Everything is fine, if something happens we will call you.
I'm going out to the toilet.
Good afternoon.
There are no changes or news.
If you don't order me to do it differently, I'll return in 4 hours.
Till our next meeting.
Krausen has reported, there are no news.
Good.
Outside search.
And?
Do I have something?
I think you're a bastard.
Do you have got some there as well?
No, no.
Hey, why don't the three of us go out to a date with girls since you're so late?
We can invite them to drink something, to...
- What?
What?
- Shut up!
Has Nico called?
We weren't here, sorry.
Watching Mat while he was surfing.
That's why we have eyes or not?
Why don't you fold down your shirt?
No, no.
That way it looks better.
Hi!
No, no now it's not working.
Hi, hi, can you hear me guys?
!
Hi!
Yes, yes, we can hear you.
Do you have any news about Cristobal and Malvina?
We're close.
I have a new lead.
- We miss you.
- Yes, yes Nico.
We would like to be with you.
Come on, come on, take off on the 5th day by car, and when you arrive home, I will be there.
Have fun, enjoy everything.
Yes, but we're unable to have fun when we know that you're there.
Relax, you don't have to think.
Leave it to me.
- Nico, when will you return?
- Soon Jazmin, I promise you.
Ay, Ay, Nico!
The monkey has peed On me for the 2nd time.
He took a crap on me!
Well guys, I need to go.
I have a hygiene problem.
Tomorrow I will call you at the same time.
- Kisses.
- Be careful.
By.
Well, well it's not easy for Nico, but at least he found the track of Cristobal.
But he hasn't said anything about the clock.
No, but asking him would make him worse, because he can't do more.
Hey, I'm going to by an ice-cream.
Someone wants to have one?
- No.
No.
- Hey.
What's up, man?
Don't you want to come to sing?
- Not now.
- What do you mean with 'not now'?
Are you serious?
Man, you're the ones who should sing for our team, don't abandon us now.
- We left the band.
- Yes, we made succes with Cielo.
That's all, we stopped to sing a while ago and we won't start it again now.
We have to win!
Come on, you need to sing a song.
Let's go.
By.
Alright, we have no news.
The kids and Feli are well.
We're making progress, not much but a little.
You will see that Paolo will help.
You know everything is cool there, and here, we're tracking a monkey, that's our mission.
Don't you think?
No, we're not tracking monkey, we're following it.
The monkey knows, it was there with my son.
With the ropes...
Come, come.
Where is Cristobal?
- Where is Cristobal?
- It's unable to speak.
Here's the map.
Monkey, monkey.
Come here.
Help with me with this, please.
Come.
Here's where we found the airplane.
We found there a corpse of a man.
Who, thank God, was not Malvina or Cristobal.
It has to be Marcos Ibarlucia.
It's a finished business.
I'll continue, I'll find them.
We will find them.
- Cristobal?
- What happened, Malvina?
My love, I was thinking...
Everything is cool, we've amazing friends.
The house is splendid, well decorated.
I say, what if...
What if...
I have a sensation that we should start to walk towards north.
To south?
To south.
What is happening is that in my mind the south means that everybody is poor there.
On the north always everybody is...
What happened?
Is he coming?
- Who is coming?
- The baby.
What baby...
How funny the baby.
I still have got a lot of time, I'm getting fatter...
Then why do you have pain?
It has nothing to do with it.
There are people who deliver in the 9th or 10th month.
I have a friend whose son completed a year within her belly...
Don't pretend to be silly, Malvina.
The birth has started.
Love, I'm fine.
Leave me alone a bit.
Malvina!
I would choose you to be the mother of my little brother, and dad hasn't left you.
Could you do me a favor?
Could you go find me some food?
Because I'm really hungry.
Go!
Relax, relax, Malvina.
Everything will be alright.
Here is your bed.
There's enough coconut.
Relax.
That's it.
Only Nike is missing.
Doesn't matter, you have to continue.
Calm down, watch the sky.
There's no sky, Cielo is not here!
HELP!
I can't do it!
Permission!
Tini!
No, I've never...
Tini!
Wow you look amazing, beautiful.
Look, what I bring to you?
Look, pickled peppers that you love so much.
And that's the most important, Tini.
A book to have something to read.
'Escape from the darkness'.
Get out from here or I will call the guards to remove you.
Tini, Tini, Tini.
You will realize that I'm your only visitor in the universe.
You have got no idea where you've stepped in.
In the jail?
Guards!
Hey, hey, hey!
Have you thought it over?
There's nothing to think about.
The best would be if you would sing.
You have got the voice, the song, the soul for it.
Yes, but we've got no desire.
Among other things that we're missing.
Can't you do it for once?
It's a competition, don't you get it?
We said no, that's all.
Stop it.
Stop letting yourself be screwed with doing it without Cielo.
What is...
Don't you dare speak about her again!
For all your life you'll think about a girl who...
Stop, Tacho, stop!
Relax a bit!
- Stop it!
Are you alright?
- Why don't you ask us about how are we?
- Leave us in peace.
- Yes, I will do that.
Calm down, it's over.
Move, let's go!
Well, officer, thank you for everything.
I left on your desk a cake, eat it with pleasure, it's really delicious.
Look after Justina, I don't know if I will visit her again.
Well, if she will change, then I will come.
- Hey, What happened?
- Stay here!
Have we arrived already?
So quickly!
Let's see!
What's going on?
What is happening?
Who are you?
What's this?
Okay, okay, it's logical we're on the river.
I'm sure that we'll arrive there, we just need to continue by the river's path.
People are always looking for water.
I don't know, Nico.
Why don't we start to search with the help of the police, it's just the 2 of us...
I don't understand why do you do this like that?
We'll never find them.
Lleca, Lleca, relax.
I want to finish the searching.
I'll find them even if they're already dead.
We will find Malvina and Cristobal.
I know it, I have faith in it.
Trust me.
Thank you, but why did you come like this?
Who are you?
Why?
What are you doing?
What are you doing here?
Ladies, change your clothes!
- Excuse me!
- What?
Do it!
We have to stop!
We have to get out now!
Wait, wait!
Why now?
What's going on?
What's happening?
I don't understand!
- There!
- What's that?
Is it more than rain?
- That's not good.
- Relax guys, it's just rain!
It's alright, is that the place where it's raining or not?
- Is it coming towards us?
...
- We can't leave, my son is out there somewhere.
- It's not good.
- Wait, come here!
Come back!
What're you doing?
You can't stay there!
Easy, young man.
Leave me alone!
Mister, I'm very well-known, but who are you?
Everything in time, Miss Justina!
I'll answer all your questions!
- Tiniti!
Help me out from here!
- Shut up, 'guanaca' [simpleton]!
Who will respond to my questions?
You will see that as well!
Later!
No, no, don't leave me alone!
Tini!
Tini, no!
Get me out, Tini!
Listen to that, it's very strange!
Seriously!
It's a sign!
It's says that we have to continue.
Come on, let's go!
Mon...
Monkey.
It's just the two of us.
Are you afraid?
- No?
- No.
Why would I be afraid?
What are we doing here?
Why don't we leave?
- No, stay here Tacho.
- I also want to leave.
Alright, but Nico was right.
It's just two days left, nothing more.
Another two days without Cielo.
At least at home we'll have Indi.
Yes.
You know I feel that Nico will find Malvina and Cristobal.
If you feel it, Gipsy, then he'll find them.
Don Indi.
We'll find them, Nico.
Yes, yes, we will find them, because Cristobal knows how to look after himself.
He's my son, he will look after Malvina.
He will look after the baby, everything will be alright.
Eat something, otherwise you can't listen to me completely.
- Imagine that.
And her?
Do you miss her?
I mean, Cielo.
Like no one else in this world.
I never thought that I could miss someone so much.
Look, Nico.
I...
Not too much happened with me, but, well, I would like to...
- I would like to tell you.
- Do what you feel, it's very good, do it!
- Tell me!
- Well, listen to me, you know that
Cielo filled, let's say fills a lot of places with her happiness.
Meanwhile, sometimes it's like that I can hear her singing... close to me.
It's clear to me that she's beside me.
I don't want to say lies, but that's what I feel and for me it's the truth.
You will think that I'm crazy, but a very similar thing is happening with me.
Every night when I'm sleeping I feel that she's caressing my hair.
And I need to force myself to think that I won't look at her, I won't, because otherwise she'll disappear.
And I'm sleeping with her caress.
If that's what you feel, it's right.
I have nothing more to say.
I...
I'm also finished.
Welcome!
Congratulations for being free again!
Nay...
Nay.
Firstly I want to know what is this?
Where am I?
What am I doing here?
Well, it's a much nicer place than the prison, isn't it?
Do you want to drink something?
Tea or coffee?
No!
I want something stronger.
- You must have lot of questions.
- Yes, I do.
I'm more disorientated than a forensics person in a delivery room.
Who are you?
I'm Franca, I'm working for the Corporation CC.
And that would be?
The corporation who freed you from the jail.
Why did you free me from the jail?
- We need you.
- For what?
We freed you to change your identity with your cousin, and that way you would work for us.
I asked you for what reason, why?
Alright, do you think that I will accept it?
Well, we can imagine that you're eager to meet again with your daughter, or no?
Good, I saw that it's attractive.
Now, listen carefully.
What happened, Malvina?
Is he coming?
That's why it hurts?
No, no, no, he is not coming.
It's just a false alarm.
Go, everything is fine.
Leave me alone.
I'm not going away, I will help you.
Tell me what to do, that's all.
Sweetie, I won't lie to you.
Come.
Your little brother is arriving.
Yes, but relax.
Sometimes the women has to do things alone, and that's one of those things.
I need you near me, because you're a champion and you helped me a lot, but... go out side, guard the entrance of the house, and I will call you when I'll need you.
- Relax, Malvina.
I'll be there.
- Okay, okay.
The ... say
Everything will be alright.
If anything happens I will shout loudly and you will come running.
No, it will be better if I will shout 'Cristobal', alright?
Go!
Hi!
All of you here?
And Feli, kids?
- She hasn't returned yet.
- We're alone in the mansion.
Look, it's not that we're afraid alone, it's just that we're kids.
No, I don't believe you.
Let's do something thing.
I will close the bar and I will make some food to eat and we will stay together until Feli is here.
- What do you think?
- Yes.
Alright that's the plan.
Let's go!
- I have to ask for help?
- Yeah, right!
It's beautiful, Mar. What's this?
No, no, nothing.
It's just a melody that I dreamed about.
Nothing more.
Have you dreamed it without lyrics?
No, I haven't thought about the lyrics.
Still, it's nothing, we're not singing anymore.
No, wait, it wasn't nothing.
How was it?
Tell me a bit about it!
- About the composing?
- Yes, about how you made it.
- I'm nervous...
It's nothing.
- Come on, Mar!
Come on, come on!
There's a place where I go when I am sad.
It's a place within me that you never saw.
I invented it to feel that you love me.
It's a place where I go when I am sad.
And if you go, then I also go.
And if you're not there, neither am I.
And nothing matters, nothing helps,
Everything is worthless, nothing is left...
Without your love.
An endless labyrinth where I get lost.
And I'm running and running without stopping and I can't find you.
And though I want to escape from you, I always remember...
That there's a place inside me where I have you.
And if you go, then I also go.
And if you're not there, neither am I.
And nothing matters, nothing helps...
Everything is worthless, nothing is left...
Without your love.
And if you go, then I also go.
And if you're not there, neither am I.
And nothing matters, nothing helps,
Everything is worthless, nothing is left...
Without your love.
It's strange that Feli hasn't come back, isn't it?
Well, it's strange, but she can leave whenever she wants to, that's what Nico said.
- Was it delicious?
- Yes, it was.
Now, help cleaning the table, please!
My stomach aches, I can't help you.
It's a lie, so he doesn't have to help.
Let's see if it really hurts so much!
Alright, alright I'll help to clear the table!
I told you!
Relax, guys!
It must be Luz coming back!
- Feli!
- Pancho you came really late!
The kids were worried, Feli!
Ah, well... but here I am!
Here I am!
- Feli!
- Luz!
I missed you a lot...
I missed everybody!
You will really do it?
You and you and you?
Take a break, it's a disaster, you're fools!
Your theme is very good, Mar!
Yes, I really loved it too, it's very good!
Well, thank you... still it was...
You know what?
When Cielo found out that I love to act, she said that I have a hidden talent for it.
- And?
- Nothing, it's just...
No, it's not nothing.
You want to say that all of us have to do what we like to do.
And we love to sing.
No, no, no.
What, are you thinking that Cielo would be happy if she would hear that we abandoned our dreams?
No, definitely not.
Do you remember when we were sad, angry, she said that the solution is singing and dancing?
Exactly, I'm always remembering her with singing and dancing.
It's good to remember to her.
We can sing...
for Cielo.
For Cielo.
- For Cielo.
- For Cielo.
For Cielo.
Jero, Jero, come here!
Well, look, we changed our minds, we will sing.
Finally, you've realized it!
What will you sing?
We will find something.
If you're afraid of making mistakes, you've already made them.
If you're afraid to lose, you've already lost.
If you're afraid to live, you've already been defeated.
If you're afraid to feel, that you haven't been chosen.
One step is already the way, a step towards your destiny.
With one step you're opening the door and the dreams of your soul are awakening.
The steps of life.
One step is already the way, one step towards your destiny a step is just another step
One step and you're alive.
What are the kids are doing?
Nothing at all, they're singing.
I've got news.
I detected electromagnetic signs, the kids are singing.
Breathe!
Relax, relax!
Wicked dreams my boy sleeps through Send us Lord, an angel true by his bedside he must stay to keep the bad dreams away
What is going on here?
What have you done, Daníel?
I...
I don't know.
-Why is Guðbjörg lying here?
(Slurred speech) I just woke up...
I was coming home from the dance.
Guðbjörg!
Guðbjörg!
You have murdered her!
-What?
It's obvious, you hit her on the head with the pan.
Are you drunk?
Oh my god.
Oh my god.
-Don't you remember anything?
No...
I don't believe this!
Gugga!
Gugga!
-It's no use, she can't hear you.
We'll have to report this.
Take it easy now.
Let's not rush things here.
Oh my god!
I should not drink.
I should never drink.
Do you realise what you have done, Daníel?
Are you ready to spend half your life in prison?
It's murder, Daníel!
Murder!
That's at least 16 years.
But we could...
I could help you make it look different.
What?
No!
Haven't you done enough to your family, Daníel?
She wasn't a good person.
Nobody will miss her.
The only thing to do is make it look accidental.
That's not possible!
-Everything's possible!
Because I have...
I have an idea.
Hello?
Daníel?
Good morning.
-Good morning.
(Heavy dragging noises)
What have I done?
What have I done?
Stop that at once, boy!
We have no time for wailing.
Sorry.
Let's try to be professional about this.
Here's the invoice.
Could you come back later?
I'm the only one around.
No, can't do that, I'm heading back into town.
It's always paid up front.
With money then?
(Laughs softly)
The hotel manager, she usually just writes a check.
There was nothing you could do.
It was self-defense and...
You had to protect yourself.
She was bullying you around.
Making sexual advances.
-What?
I assume so.
But she's not the victim here.
You are.
No Georg, we can't...
I have to turn myself in.
Nobody is turning themselves in.
I've become an accomplice!
But what if it gets found out?
It won't be found out.
I'll make certain of it.
Tomorrow I'll call the police and tell them that Guðbjörg wandered up into the mountains while drunk.
They'll find her there and it'll look like an accident.
No.
It's not like you'll be helping her if you do this.
You think she'll come back to life if you go to prison?
No.
-Exactly.
Hey.
Where have you been?
-We've been looking for Guðbjörg.
Yes, hello, what happened to your forehead?
Bang a wall?
Yeah.
How irresponsible for her to disappear without a word.
Yeah.
Where did she go?
We don't know.
She was here last night, drunk as a skunk.
Then she went out, probably looking for some company.
Let's just hope nothing has happened to her.
Did she say that she wasn't coming back or?
We don't know Ólafur.
But because of these events, me and Daníel have reached the mutual decision that I become the hotel manager in her absence.
Isn't that so?
-Yes.
Shouldn't you be the manager?
You've been here longer.
No.
Georg has more experience.
Yes, I have the experience and I agree with Daníel.
Did you check in her room...?
Don't you worry about this.
Just go and do the outdoor chores.
Outdoor?
But I'm the supervisor...
Not anymore.
Now go and clean up the mud between the tiles so that the moss won't grow there again.
And put salt in the gaps!
Now!
Get going!
March!
Daníel, let's not tell the idiot about this.
He'll crack under the slightest pressure and blabber it to everyone.
-Yeah sure.
You know that this is all being done for you, Daníel.
Now lighten up a bit, grab a shower and now it is important to just pretend that nothing has happened.
Just try to forget it all.
-Yes.
(Scraping sounds)
(Papershuffling sounds)
(Clicking sounds)
Cassettes
(Machine sounds)
I look like a woman.
-It looks good on you.
These are women's clothes.
-Don't be silly Ólafur.
This doesn't fit me at all.
It's ridiculous.
Ridiculous?
The only thing here that's ridiculous is your face, and since me and Daníel could get used to that, you should be able to get used to this.
It's weird to move around in this.
It's work attire and I won't hear another word about it!
I have drawn a new work schedule here.
Hold this.
Daníel is Green, Ólafur is Blue and I am Red.
Green is in charge of the kitchen and the rooms.
If Blue is in the kitchen area then he becomes your underling and you may use the radio to contact him.
Blue is in charge of the camping area as well as everything else outdoors, but between 11:00 and 13:00, as well as 17:00 and 21:00, then you are in charge of the
dining area.
I don't want you talking much to the guests.
If Blue asks you for assistance in the camping area then you become his underling, and then vice versa.
This will make our work much easier as well as more fun.
(Door opening)
Hey.
Hello.
Well, Flemming Geir.
Don't you have some explaining to do?
I'm sorry I went to the dance.
-You disobeyed direct orders.
So?
-So?
What does that imply?
I was gonna ask the lady if I could get paid in advance.
In advance?
But you haven't done any work?
I'll work to cover it.
Where is she anyway?
She is not here.
In her absence I am in charge here.
Wait, so I can't get any money?
How much do you need?
-About five thousand or so.
Five thousand?
Why in the blazes?
-Because.
No, that is out of the question.
Uhm...
Flemming?
I am willing to accept this.
But you'll have to work for it.
Stanford-Binet IQ test for 12-16 year olds
You'll show up for work every morning at nine and work 'till five.
Longer if it's needed.
That too?
-Yes.
I'll be in my office when you're done.
Wait, do I get my money then?
-Yes.
Are you ready?
And go!
Hurry, you have 25 minutes!
I know exactly what happened here, you know.
I'm not born yesterday, I can see right through you.
You can?
-Don't need an expert to see that.
Well, I...
-He just scared her off.
Huh?
-Georg.
He must have said something to her and she just up and left.
Had enough.
Left us two alone here with him.
It's obvious.
But I don't understand why you let him run the place.
I'm not sure...we'll have to help each other and...
Someone has to be in charge and Georg has experience.
Are you two suddenly just kissing ass dot com?
Since when are you two such good buddies?
Don't badmouth Georg.
-Why not?
We just have to keep the place running while...
While Gugga isn't here.
-Did I hit a weak spot?
Listen, there are people waiting for their food.
Get back to work.
OK.
-Yes, I'm Green!
I'm in charge in the kitchen!
Some boss you are.
-Don't disturb me!
I need to cook here.
(Turns on recorder)
Point number 6B.
Forced subject to take a
Stanford-Binet IQ test and rewarded subject with money.
Even though subject disobeyed orders.
(Car starting)
Subject showed a positive reaction and smiled.
Enjoy your meal.
-Thanks.
Hannes?
-No.
Dad?
-Kristján?
No, Ólafur.
Dad, don't you recognize me?
Ólafur.
Ragnar.
Ólafur?
!
?
Ólafur...man, what are you doing here?
I work here.
-You work here?
Yeah, I supervise the outdoor area, and I'm also the head waiter when needed, like now.
Ah.
-I sorta watch over the hotel.
What are you wearing?
Is that a...
It's a suit.
Work attire.
I thought I'd take a small break away from the city.
Uh-huh.
-I had just had enough of it all.
What exactly was it that wasn't panning out for you?
Just so much to do and...
I needed some time to relax.
There's free room and board here, you know.
Hmm.
-I'm just getting myself back on track.
I see.
-But what about you?
What are you up to?
I'm still selling...always selling stuff.
Yes.
-I have to live and a family to feed and...
I see.
-Yes.
You have a new family then?
-With Magga.
You have met Magga, haven't you?
-Uh...yes, sure.
OK.
And your little brother?
Oh...
But what are you selling these days?
I have a sticky thing going now, my friend.
Something neat, then?
How do you do.
My name is Georg Bjarnfreðarson.
I am an employee here at Bjarkalundur.
(Voice on phone) Oh howdy.
I am calling around in the neighbourhood and inquiring about our hotel manager, Guðbjörg.
Oh?
-We haven't seen her since yesterday.
No?
That isn't good.
-No, we are getting worried here.
See, there are travel bags and travel toilets and travel this and that.
But this my friend, to give you the short of it, is a travel sauna.
Yes, hello!
-Yes.
What is it?
-A sauna.
A travel sauna.
Get out of town.
-Now you can take a sauna whenever you feel like it.
You come home exhausted from work and slip it out and the nest thing you know you find yourself in a jacuzzi at home.
Yes, and just have a cold one with it?
-Exactly.
What does it run on?
-Nothing.
Just plug it in.
Yes...
Babe in a sauna.
-Right on.
Do we need to talk about it?
-This doesn't get groovier.
No, I don't think so.
Have you sold much of this?
I'm shovelling it out.
The country folk loves it.
Coming from the stables with manure between your toes and then sitting in this, they're like new persons.
These people didn't look like that before they got their hands on the Total Sauna kit.
Nosiree.
You'll lose a ton by sitting in this.
Surely.
-It's a total revolution.
You have plenty of these?
What are you doing?
-I was just...
Those are drugs Daníel!
I'm putting my life on the line for you and
I do not deserve this from you!
I'm sorry, it was just left behind...
I've made myself an accomplice, Daníel!
I know...don't...it was just this one time.
Wasn't it enough for you to take Guðbjörg's life, now you have to ruin mine as well?
Don't you ever get enough?
I'll sell it for...12 thousand each.
Family price.
I kinda owe it to you, due to that Confirmation fiasco.
What should I be selling them for?
Twenty thousand?
At the very least.
-Hello!
That's a double profit.
I'll take them all.
-Then you'll get them for 11 thou.
That's very good man.
-Yes it is.
Why are you not working?
I'm...sealing up a deal here.
Use proper language with me.
Say, is there any chance to get an advance from that mutual account...
-No, that is not possible.
It's very important.
I'm doing something big...
Out of the question!
-Why not?
We took a mutual decision and we stand by it.
Relax, haven't you crossed out of your oceans here?
Yeah, aren't you getting some back home?
I live with my mother!
And?
Is there a cold front over the country?
Don't be stiff, stagnant and stubborn.
Who is this?
This is Georg, my colleague.
Oh, I'm Hannes.
Ólafur's father.
Georg Bjarnfreðarson is my name.
I'm the boss here.
So you're Ólafur's father, then?
Yes.
That even went before the courts, but wasn't appealed.
Say...we're trying to conduct some business here, so...
Yes.
And this place would then be the Gates of Hell?
Huh?
-Left wide open and you two just sail on through.
The boy's gonna make millions on this.
You think so?
-Yes.
I can tell where Ólafur got his business sense from.
Sure you can.
You have five minutes Ólafur, and not a second more!
Well Óli, are you going to take them, or...?
Do you have a pen?
-Sure.
Results of IQ tests show that subject is well over average in intelligence, in which his genes play a big factor... (Bell chimes)
Good evening.
-Evening.
Are you Georg?
Yes.
-Yes hello, we spoke on the phone this morning.
I'm Víglundur, this is my wife Stella and my son Óðinn.
How do you all do.
-Hi.
Has Guðbjörg turned up yet?
-What?
Oh, no...no word yet.
She'll show up.
-I most certainly am hoping so.
But it's hard on the staff that she disappears like this.
It's irresponsible of her.
But enough of that, what can I do for you?
Do you have a table for us?
It's the boy's 20th birthday.
Oh, it's your birthday?
-Yeah.
Congratulations for that.
-Thank you.
Shouldn't I be serving them?
Ain't I Blue?
No, I'll serve our honored guests, Ólafur.
Daníel, there's a lovely couple here with their son and it's his birthday.
I ask of you to do your best with their meals and to be extra generous.
Ólafur, put some good music on in the dining hall, let's try to make a good ambiance here.
(Clears throat)
(From outside kitchen) Well, there's music coming up and we're doing our best to make everything comfortable for you.
(Flowerpot breaking)
(Soft music playing)
Here we have organically grown cherry juice in soda, all on the house.
Isn't it good?
Yes, it is.
-Wonderful.
(Sings falsely in key to the music) Happy birthday to you, happy...he's twenty today he's...this boy here.
Ólafur, come out here!
Sing this song with me!
The text is simple, it's...
Happy birthday to you, he is twenty years old this boy here.
-...this boy here.
Wonderful, and when you settle the check you shall receive a 50% discount.
-Isn't that too much?
No no, not at all.
It's the least I can do.
For I call the shots.
I am the boss here!

Árni Víkingur Hafsteinsson
Oh, Amy, this is gonna be fun.
- I think so.
- A nice quiet night together.
- Yeah, it's gonna be good.
- Movie night.
- Uh, sir?
- Yeah?
Um, you have some late charges here on the movie "Whores on the Loose."
- What?
- No no.
No no no.
- Stop right there.
- Tim!
- I did not rent that.
- You sure did.
You've had it out for 56 days.
- Tim!
- That's crazy.
- I can't even afford that.
- I can't believe this.
No, what's the plot?
What happens?
Okay, a bunch of whores go into a dance club and whore it up all night long.
That's the plot?
That's not even a good storyline.
- I'm leaving.
- You're leaving?
- Yeah, forget it.
- It's movie night.
Tim, have fun with the whores.
It's movie night.
Ooh.
Actually, sir, you were right.
It was "The Notebook" that was late.
- Not "Whores on the Loose."
- Nope. "The Notebook."
My bad.
- Oh, Stu?
- Yeah?
- I got problems.
- Really?
I need to impress Amy somehow.
- Okay.
- She thinks I'm a screw-up.
That's a fair assessment.
- What's that?
- Don't listen to me.
Ask for a promotion.
- A promotion?
- Yeah.
- You think he'll give it to me?
- Yeah.
Just storm in there and lay down the law.
- Storm in?
- Mm-hmm.
I don't storm in anywhere.
- Okay, I have a solution.
- Yeah?
Walk in there nervously and lay down the law in a stuttering, insecure manner.
I can handle that.
That's more my speed.
So I hate to just storm in here and lay down the law like this...
- Mm-hmm?
...but there's no two ways about it.
I'm...
I'm due for a promotion and I'm here to claim it.
I'm sorry.
How did you get in here?
- How did I get in?
- Who on earth are you?
- I'm Tim.
- Tim.
- Timothy.
- Yeah.
Terrible name.
Very weak weak.
It implies a weak will.
Have you considered changing it?
How does "Keith" strike you?
- Keith?
- I have a daschund named Keith.
- What?
- It would make things very easy for me if your name was also Keith.
I don't want to change my name to Keith.
That's... my license I've gotta change...
All right, all right, but listen, I'm gonna give you this promotion.
That's amazing.
I got the promotion.
Done.
I just need you to do me one small little favor.
- Anything.
- Tomorrow night, you will accompany my daughter to her senior prom.
- Prom?
- Golden years.
That sounds like fun, but I can't go to a prom.
- Some punk canceled on her...
- No.
...and she's been bawling and weeping in the bathroom ever since.
I'm sorry to hear that, but my girlfriend... she doesn't like me doing things with teenage girls
- in general...
- Really?
...dancing with them or...
- Listen, just go to the prom, you get your promotion.
That's the way the business world works.
- Come on, Keith!
- All right, if that's the way
- the business world works.
- Good boy.
Tim, why are you all dressed up?
- I got great news.
- Tell me.
My boss invited me to a black-tie function.
Yeah, right.
I am going to a black-tie function at work.
- You're lying.
- I'm lying?
No.
I'm up for a promotion.
And after they asked me, they said,
"Why don't you come to this black-tie function tonight?"
Why do you keep saying "black-tie function"?
- That's what it is.
- What does that even mean?
I can't get into the details of corporate events...
- Why?
...with loved ones at home.
- What is it, a dinner?
- It's a black-tie function.
Okay, well, whatever it is, congratulations.
- Thank you.
- But why are you carrying a corsage?
You don't do that at business dinners?
- No...
- You don't pin a corsage on your boss?
- No, you don't.
- I'm gonna bring it just in case.
Ah, finally a meeting of the two Keiths.
No, I'm Tim, remember?
- I thought...
- Remember, I didn't switch it.
- I thought you did.
- I'm still Tim.
Hmm.
So anyway, you horny son of a bitch, the ground rule for tonight is this... it's simple:
Don't touch my daughter.
- That's it.
- Don't hug her, don't shake her hand, don't dance any closer than three feet away, you understand?
Those are all subsets of the same rule?
Don't touch my daughter.
- Hi, I'm Crystal.
- Oh, hey.
- You must be Tim.
- I am.
- I got you this.
- Oh, a corsage.
- That's so sweet.
- If you'll allow me...
Okay.
- Ow, that's my boob.
- Whoops whoops, no touching.
Ouch.
That's my boob again.
- No touching.
Hold on.
- Timothy...
Let me get around back.
Let me do it from back here.
That is not my boob.
That's my ass.
What is it?
No, I'm just trying to gain my footing.
- Timothy!
- One second.
- Forget the corsage.
- All right, no touching.
Keith?
Oh, Tim, have you ever seen "Girls Gone Wild"?
- Uh, no.
- I'm in four of them!
- Really?
- Yeah.
I'm in "Girls Gone Wild:
High School,"
"Girls Gone Wild:
Spring Break,"
"Girls Gone Wild on the D-Train,"
and "Girls Gone Wild in Front of the Post Office."
- That one just came out.
- Really?
You should look for it around Christmas.
I will.
Your dad knows about this?
Oh yeah, he totally supports it.
No!
Duh!
So, Tim, I know that you like work with my dad and all, but I just think you're totally hot.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Nice.
- I mean, that cute little way you stutter and everything...
- Really?
...it, like, totally makes me horny.
Stuttering makes you horny?
- It just does.
- Wow, that's... that's easy.
Um, listen, you're...
you're a great girl, and I'm...
I'm glad I'm making you horny,
I really am, but nothing can happen tonight, you know?
I promised your dad I'd watch after you.
And I have a girlfriend, who I've gotta say I think she's the one.
Oh my God, we are totally dancing!
Hold on a second.
I gotta take this.
- Amy, is that you?
- Hi!
Hey, Tim,
I just want to see how it's going.
- It's going good.
- Oh good.
Pretty straightforward black-tie corporate function.
Well, that music's kind of loud, isn't it?
It's the corporate theme.
- Oh.
- They're just getting ready
- to do a PowerPoint presentation.
- Ah, okay.
Let's slam some tequila, brother!
Whoo-hoo, yeah!
South of the border!
- Whoa, what was that?
- That's the CEO.
Whip out your sombrero!
Let's tie one on, chief!
Who's he...
is he talking to you?
He was pretty pleased with the quarterly results.
Ah.
Okay, well... have fun.
Okay, come on, Tim, get into it.
I'm not allowed to touch you.
- I have to stay three feet away.
- Come on!
Just spank my butt rap-video style.
Your dad is not into rap-video style.
Don't be such a lame date.
Spank me!
I guess I have no choice.
Ouch!
What?
What happened?
- Hey!
Hey, you!
- Me?
- Old guy, yeah!
- Me?
- You spanked that girl!
- Yeah, that was an agreement we had.
- She requested it.
- I didn't mean a real spank, you loser!
I meant a fun, you know... ooh ooh... dance-floor spank!
I don't even know what that means.
Not cool, Jumpstreet.
What are you, some kind of rat?
Hold that fucker down, man.
I'll get the principal.
All right, you, Timbo, phone number now.
- I'm calling your parents.
- No no.
- What do you mean no?
- My parents live in Italy.
Italy?
Shut up.
This is a prom.
It's not an orgy, son.
I'm aware that I'm not at an orgy.
- Zip it.
- That much I know.
Crystal, how are you doing?
- He got me pretty good.
- Of course he got you good.
Look at the mitts on this creep.
So, yeah, Tim's finally getting promoted.
- Isn't that great?
- Oh, that's wonderful news, sweetheart.
- Good for him.
- Yeah, I'm really proud of him.
Oh, you should have seen it.
He looked so cute in his tuxedo when he left.
Hold on, Mom.
Let me grab this other call.
Hi, this is Principal McCreevy
You've got to come down to the prom and pick up your son.
- My son?
- Your son.
I think you have the wrong number.
You think... your son Timothy, he's here at the prom.
Caught him spanking a young girl...
her ass looks like a tomato.
- Oh, that son Timothy.
- Mm-hmm.
Yeah, why don't you send him home?
False alarm, Mom.
No promotion for Tim.
I figured as much.
- Okay, let me get this straight.
- Yeah?
Instead of attending the business dinner you told me you were going to, you went to a high-school prom?
No, I told you I was going to a black-tie function.
I delivered on that promise.
Tim, you went to a prom with an 18-year-old girl and you spanked her so hard she can hardly walk.
The spank got away from me.
- And you got sent home!
- Yeah.
They send you home once you spank someone.
I've learned that lesson.
Listen, Amy,
- I did it for you.
- For me.
- All of this.
- Thank you, Tim.
- I really appreciate it.
- Don't mention it.
I wanted the promotion.
I was gonna spank my way to the top.
That's all I'm trying to do here.
You know, I don't ever want to talk about this again.
I like that plan.
I like that a lot.
- What a day.
- Mm-hmm.
- Any big plans tonight?
- Nothing.
- How about you?
- Yeah, I'm actually having dinner
- with Amy and her friends.
- Well, let's see,
I've got my MetroCard.
I've got... no seats available...
that's typical.
Man, I feel bad for that old guy.
Why don't you give him your seat?
You know, I might just do that.
- Excuse me, sir?
- Hello.
I couldn't help but notice you looking for a seat, and I'd like to offer you mine.
What the hell is that supposed to mean?
What does it mean?
Are you not understanding me?
I was offering you my seat.
You can sit, sir.
Do you think I'm some kind of feeble old man?
- Oh, no.
- Is that what's spinning in your skull right now?
Oh no, I was just being nice.
I swim 10 laps every day.
I can do push-ups with my John Thomas.
- Did you know that?
- What's a John Thomas?
- I think it's a penis.
- No, that's not possible.
No, it's very possible.
I've seen it on YouTube.
- No, that's too much weight.
- You've got some nerve, you condescending son of a bitch!
I didn't mean to offend you.
I'm sorry.
- Well, too late, pal.
- Too late.
Yeah, sit down, you dick!
What?
What's going on here?
I was being nice.
Just leave the guy alone, dude.
This is not the reaction I was expecting.
- It offends the hell out of me.
- Why don't we just drop it?
The only thing I want to drop is you.
- You want to drop me.
- I want to fight you.
- You want to fight me.
- I want to fight you.
- Come on, mano y mano, dude!
- I'm not fighting anybody.
Everyone, relax.
What was that?
You just got bitch-slapped.
I'm not fighting you.
You can slap me all day, I'm not gonna fight an elderly... stop.
How does this happen?
Stop.
Ouchie!
You know what?
Now we're fighting.
- Good.
- All right.
You pick the place.
Hell, I'll pick it for you.
Gleason's Gym in Brooklyn, you chickenshit.
Ah... okay.
He's not stopping.
Stop.
Stop slapping.
So I spent the summer in Slovakia helping to build a school in a town where no real education system existed before.
- Wow.
- The look on those kids' faces, it's just hard to put into words.
That's amazing.
Oh, honey, tell them what you're doing with the animals.
- Oh, um...
- You wanna order something?
Well, now that you've asked,
I work with an animal shelter for ferrets and gerbils.
I drive them up to Westchester each weekend and I'll let them run free.
You know, the looks on their little faces when I turn them loose, they're... now I'm doing it...
- they're just so happy.
- That's incredible.
I mean, I don't know how you find the time for all of this.
Well, Amy, you know, you just make the time.
- That's right, sweetie.
- You just make the time.
Well, enough about me.
Tim, do you do any charity work?
Not a lot.
I'm just too busy.
Well, why don't you join me Friday night?
Come to the animal shelter.
- I, uh...
- We'll bake treats for the gerbils.
- No, Friday's bad for me.
- Aw, why?
Yeah, what are you so busy with on Friday?
I'm boxing an old man.
Oh, that was a fun dinner.
You're boxing an old man.
- Uh...
- What is wrong with you, Tim?
- That's a good question.
- You and George are the same age, and he's out there making a difference in the world.
Hey, at least I'm out there fighting.
It's not like I'm sitting at home on the couch.
That was so embarrassing.
George does all these things.
- No.
- He gives so much.
- You don't do anything.
- He gives too much.
When you're flying to Slovakia, I think you've got a problem.
I just think you have some serious soul-searching to do.
All right, I'll go down and I'll cancel the fight and soul-searching... soul-searching might have to wait till the weekend.
Hey, Stu, thanks for coming down, but I decided to forfeit the fight.
What possible reason do you have to not want to fight an old man in a weird old gym with old men all over the place?
I get it.
I guess I understand.
Yeah, Amy's mad at me.
She wants me to start doing more charity work.
- Excuse me.
- Yes?
- I'm Henry's daughter.
- Oh.
- Are you the young man from the bus?
- I am.
Listen, there's no way I'm fighting your father.
I just came to forfeit and apologize to him
- in case I hurt his feelings.
- Oh.
I just want this to go away.
Please, please don't do that.
- Please don't forfeit?
- It makes him feel young again.
Won't you fight him, please?
I can't fight an elderly...
Look, just take a dive and let him win.
- Take a dive.
- Yeah.
This'll be his last hurrah.
You can look at it as charity work.
It is like charity work, I guess.
- Right?
- Yeah, it's a lot like charity work, but instead of building a bridge in a needy village, you're gonna break the bridge of an old man's nose.
- You look fantastic, champ.
- The glory days.
- You're gonna take him, I can feel it.
- Back to the glory days.
Just remember we'll be with you every swing.
I gotta say this actually feels nice.
- Mm-hmm.
- I can see why people volunteer.
Let's make it real fun for him.
If he used to be a boxer, then he probably loves to trash talk.
- I'm not gonna trash talk.
- Come on, Timbo.
Step it up.
This guy's having the time of his life and yelling vulgar obscenities is the only way to top it.
What would I say?
"I'm gonna knock you out real good"?
Wow, you're like Hemmingway.
You've got to really lay into him
- if you want to make it seem realistic.
- Okay.
You say to him, "Hey, old man, I'm gonna knock you out.
And when I'm done with this, I'm gonna go home and hump your wife from behind
- like a rabid dog."
- You think stuff like that
- would help him enjoy it?
- I think he'll have a great time when he hears that kind of stuff.
Okay, gentlemen, I want a good clean fight.
- Understood?
- Understood.
Oh, I'll keep it clean by mopping the floor with this old man's ass.
- How's that sound?
- Excuse me?
Let's get it on!
I am here to kill an old man.
- Good.
- That is my goal for the evening.
Tell him you want to cut off his skin and wear it as a coat.
I'm gonna cut off your skin and wear it as a coat.
What an awful thing to say.
Oh, I'm gonna pound your face until you shit your pants.
- Good.
- Who knows?
I might just go hump your wife afterwards back at the condo...
- What?
...after I knock the shit out of you.
So you're gonna pound me until there's shit all over the floor...
- Exactly.
...then go violate my wife?
I will be humping your wife within the hour.
- Oh my God!
- I'm gonna go into your cabinet and switch your medications with my fist.
Don't you dare touch my medication.
- I'm gonna switch 'em.
- Don't you dare!
- I'm gonna switch 'em.
- You're out of your mind!
- I can't breathe.
- You ever feel a fist down your throat?
I can't breathe...
- What happened?
- Down goes the old man!
You sick bastard!
What?
- Get out of the ring!
- One, two, three...
I never hit him.
...eight, nine...
- It's only charity if I lose.
...10!
We have a winner,
- and his name is Tim!
- No no.
- Don't hold my hand up.
- Tim!
- Tim!
- Please stop doing that.
You monster!
Good news, gentlemen.
- Yeah?
- He is eating solid foods
- and he knows exactly where he is.
- Nice.
Now could you help me out and tell me what happened here?
- What happened?
- Mm-hmm.
Um, we were at a charity event...
- Okay.
...and there was a mishap,
- a minor mishap.
- Charity mishap.
- That's kind of broad.
- What sort of mishap...
Let me just clarify.
Tim got in a fight with an old man,
- and threatened to hump his wife.
- No.
And then he also said he was gonna beat him until he lost control of his bowels and crapped on himself.
- I see.
- Just put down "charity event mishap."
That sums it up, no?
Could you wait here for one minute?
I have some paperwork for you to fill out.
Amy is so gonna find out about this.
- How would she find out?
- She always finds out.
- Hey, Tim?
- See?
- Hey!
- Hey, George.
- Hi!
- Why are you possibly here?
Well, I finished up early with the gerbils, so I thought I'd come down and help out with some retarded kids.
- You don't say.
- I help mentally-challenged children set up their own MySpace pages.
Incredibly thoughtful.
You should see the looks on their faces when they log in.
I can only imagine how rewarding it is.
- What are you doing here?
- Uh, same thing actually.
- Charity work.
- Charity work.
Your words inspired me to get involved.
- Oh really?
- Yeah yeah.
Elderly.
- Aw, that's terrific.
- Yeah, giving back.
Okay, son, if you could just fill this form out for us?
Explain exactly how and why you were fighting an elderly man.
It'll just save some time for us when the police get here.
So before you say anything,
I just want to thank you and your friend George for getting me into the world of charity.
Tim, what happened to forfeiting the fight?
What are you talking about?
We never fought.
He had the heart attack before any...
before I landed any punches.
Tim, I just read the police report.
- Yeah?
- "Hey, old man, you're gonna shit your pants after I open this can of whupass on you."
- No.
- What is that?
- I don't know.
I didn't say that.
- It's in the report, Tim.
- Who talks like that?
- Saying you were gonna fuck his wife?
That's awful, hearing it back out of context.
- What kind of charity is that?
- It's not a great one.
It's not exactly Meals on Wheels.
What he's trying to tell you is that...
I'm pregnant.
I have a new puzzle for you to solve.
This complex is massive.
- Prewar.
What, late 30's?
- I believe.
It's before Eureka was built.
What's down there?
Ever since you got to this town, you've been looking for something.
Tell me what's going on.
No.
- I have to what?
- Oversee the mayoral election.
This is the official polling place.
It's not a big deal, Carter.
- Well, now why can't Jo do it?
- Because Jo's not your lackey.
Well, the town charter says that voting security falls on the highest ranking law enforcement officer.
That would be you.
Unless you promote me or become otherwise incapacitated.
The Mayor's seat has been open for over a year.
The town needs a voice.
This is a very important service card.
How important can it be?
I mean, my daughter's backing her 17-year-old boyfriend for the job.
Eureka doesn't discriminate.
Some of our smartest citizens are teens.
So instead of working, I have to sit here and count ballots for some doogie Mayor?
No, actually, your sister volunteered for that job.
It's a bad idea.
Lex becomes really obsessed with politics.
And her mood swings are already out of hand.
Actually, she's really into it.
And you should be more sensitive.
- Your sister's pregnant.
- I'm Mr. Sensitive.
Like...
What...
Paper ballots?
Digital voting machines are way too easy to tamper with.
And campaigns get really competitive around here.
Okay.
I'll do it.
I'm...
I'm...
- Thank you.
- Mr. Sensitive though.
Oh, my goodness.
What a beautiful baby.
Love that shirt.
That's me, you know.
More Vinspresso?
Remember, vote Vincent.
You're doing great.
They love you!
I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
I hate politics.
We're the glue that holds this town together, Vincent.
It's time we had a voice.
Smile.
- That's great, thanks.
- All right.
Now back to kissin' babies.
A vote for Lucas is a vote for youthful innovation.
Oh, here's his ten point plan.
Kylie, can you help me pass out some more buttons, please?
Then can we work on our lab project?
What's more important, Kylie, homework or changing the world?
I don't know, Zoe.
- I've never been much of a leader.
- Which is why you have me.
That baby face of yours promises idealism and hope for all the minors of the town.
And I am going to help you deliver it.
- You mean manipulate it.
- Tomay-to.
Tomah-to.
Sheriff Carter.
Paulo Herrera.
Nephrologist, concerned citizen, and future mayor of Eureka.
Well, you don't see that combo platter every day.
I'd like to talk to you about getting your endorsement.
I'm getting coffee.
- Could...
- Not your lackey.
Well, I...
Mr. Herrera is it?
I would love to endorse somebody, but...
But he's already promised his endorsement...
- To my candidate, right, Sheriff?
- Actually...
Eureka needs a mayor who understands how a company town works.
Why?
So your boss can have some Global Dynamics puppet to sell out the town?
How many people is Thorne gonna fire?
So Vincent is the best candidate, he's all about nurturing the community.
Guys!
I just want my coffee.
Vincent, get Sheriff Carter a Vinspresso on the house.
It's already on the house and bribery is a crime.
Yeah.
Nice try, Fargo.
Do we amuse you, Herrera?
Watch and learn, kids.
Folks, would everybody follow me outside?
I have something that will entertain and amaze you.
Okay.
I'm done.
Now can we talk about our project?
I've got some damage control to do.
- Why don't you just get it started?
- But we're supposed to work together.
We will after you've shown me what you've got.
- So you're letting me take lead?
- That's right.
Now get to work, partner.
Leave professional politics to the professionals.
- Told you it gets competitive.
- That's just wrong.
- Big news, guys.
- Yeah, what's up?
Those ancient security cameras we saw in the bunker,
I pulled the negatives before Thorne locked the place up again.
It's 35 millimeter.
We just have to find someone old enough to develop it.
What?
The latest next gen technology Zane's been developing for our sponsor.
Overengineered to keep you cool in the hottest situations.
It's amazing what the greatest minds and a big old corporate check can buy.
Too bad we can't buy the next mayoral election.
Just kidding, Allison.
I would, however, like you to endorse Dr. Herrera.
Well, won't that be seen as Global Dynamics taking sides?
Maybe.
But on the other hand, having someone to smooth ruffled feathers during the next round of cutbacks isn't a bad idea.
Well, I prefer to make up my own mind.
You should also think about what's best for Global.
We need a personal relationship with the town.
One that shows that we're all on the same team.
Are you and I on the same team, Eva?
Of course.
I'd like to think we're also friends.
Good.
So why don't you tell me what's in the bunker under Tesla.
We found bariogenic radiation.
Zoe and her friends are very lucky that they weren't infected.
That's why I'm ordering a thermal cleaning of the entire facility.
You realize you'll destroy any organic material that's left inside.
Our first obligation is to the town.
Excuse me.
Make sure you vote.
This is Allison Blake.
I need some records from the archive.
What a time suck this is.
How did we live before digital?
I never knew you had an artistic side, Carter.
I'm a man of many facets.
Check out the date stamp. 1939.
I thought Eureka wasn't founded till 1950.
Well, it wasn't.
What were they doin' down there?
Well, whatever it was, they tried to bury it for good.
Look who we have here.
- Sarah, lights.
- Certainly, Sheriff.
That was yesterday?
Thorne's been lookin' for somethin' ever since she came to Eureka.
How much you wanna bet it's in this room?
So what is she up to?
That's gonna have to wait till tomorrow.
The debate's about to start.
- You prepare your opening remarks?
- What opening remarks?
Hello.
Hello.
Is this on?
Hi, everyone.
Welcome to debate night.
- I'm Sheriff Carter and I'll be...
- Cut to the chase!
We want issues, not filler!
Thank you, Lexi, for your wildly inappropriate enthusiasm.
So without further ado, I give you your candidates.
And if elected, I'll bring the same principles to the mayor's office as I do to Café Diem.
In short, you want it, I got it!
I promise to bring a voice to the pre-teen prodigy that the establishment too often sees as just another pretty brain.
Times are changing and Eureka must change with it.
I will protect the tenets on which this town was founded and help usher in a new day for Eureka.
It's a new day all right.
Just another days in Eureka.
Well, it's a mini sun.
Really?
Took you all night to come up with that?
No.
It took us all night to rule out any GD experiments as the cause.
- So now we have two suns.
- Just like Tatooine.
- Tatu-what?
- Geek speak.
The good news is it's stable holding its position at about 1,000 feet.
We're not lighting the entire state.
The last thing we need is a spotlight on the town the whole world can see.
Well, agree.
But it's 6:00 A.M.
And 90 degrees.
How do we turn it off?
I'm not sure yet.
It has to be some kind of fusion reaction.
- Sounds dangerous.
- No, not necessarily.
Based on its containment, I'd say it's deliberate.
Who'd want to make a second sun on purpose?
Maybe the guy who was trying to make a big bang at the debates.
Oh, cloud guy.
Herrera.
Eva wanted me to endorse him.
- Such a hidden agenda.
- What do you mean?
Zane found some security photos of her sneaking around the facility.
- What's down there anyway?
- Well, nothing for long.
She ordered a thermal cleaning.
Can we stop it till we get inside?
No, she's forbidden access.
The whole place is classified.
Something's goin' on.
You go talk to Herrera.
I'll look into it.
Yes, Allison Blake.
She asked for me?
Okay.
I'm on my way.
- Hot enough for you?
- Yeah.
What's with the umbrellas?
He likes to be prepared?
Did that just come from inside?
That would be yes.
You changed your mind about that endorsement?
Not really.
What is this?
This is the end to drought, which we may be needing sooner than later.
Welcome to my cloud farm.
Cloud farm?
Yeah, that's...
that's what he said.
I'm taking Cloud City to a whole new level with nanotech hydration.
Cumulus, stratus, cirrus, I can create 'em all.
Like you did with the cloud gag yesterday.
Nice, huh?
I found a way to hydrogenically infuse the atmosphere so I can sculpt clouds.
The commercial applications are limitless.
Well, I'm more concerned about your sun stunt.
Sun?
No, no.
I'm a cloud guy.
Not that I don't mind the bump in the polling numbers.
People love a spectacle.
Yeah, but you have to admit the timing was suspicious.
Have anyone from Global come and review my record.
My life is an open book, Sheriff.
I'm beholden to my constituents.
Gotta admit, it's a hell of a show.
Zane.
Just the man I'm lookin' for.
Save your breath, Fargo.
I already know who I'm voting for.
I'm offended.
You think I'm only here to get your vote?
- You're not?
- No.
I also want a favor.
It is roasting out there.
A candidate has to project cool confidence under the most extreme conditions.
I hear you're beta testing something that can help with staying cool.
- Yeah, I might be.
- Give me enough to get through the election and if... when Vincent wins,
I'll name a park bench after you.
Tempting, but no.
I don't do politics.
But good luck with that.
Based on these sun scans, I'd say your competition's definitely heating up.
I was testing the voting machines and I got dizzy.
I know you're not an OB.
Not really a fan of western medicine.
- But I trust you.
- Well, I'm flattered.
I'm sure you have much bigger issues to deal with.
Yes, and I have people to deal with them.
So let's put your mind at ease.
So Carter says you've always been interested in politics.
He said I'm obsessed, didn't he?
No.
Jack thinks the system is broken.
But I think it's up to us to make the system work.
Well, this little guy's system is working perfectly.
Here.
Want to take a look?
It's amazing.
- What, is something wrong?
- I think I figured out why your hormones are so out of whack.
You're getting a double dose.
Lexi, you're having twins.
Both boys.
Two sons?
Two suns.
Why didn't I think of that?
- Because it's crazy.
- It's brilliant.
Lucas, I don't think you appreciate what's at stake here.
I mean, the mayor's office oversees City hall.
- So?
- So...
That includes the Sheriff's department.
You could be my dad's boss.
- And I thought he hated me now.
- It's time to step up our game.
When the world hands you suns, make sunscreen.
Iced mocha, folks.
Stays cool as Vincent will be when he takes the oath of office.
Suits?
It's over 100 degrees out here.
Some candidates can handle the heat better than others.
Nice gimmick.
We're just helping the voters stay refreshed so they can make a cogent decision at the polling booth.
We're just trying to protect voters from harmful UV rays so they won't be blinded by indecision.
- Iced mocha!
Get it while it's cold.
- Sunscreen, people.
Vote Lucas and say no to premature aging.
Zoe, I've had a small issue with our class project.
Bigger priorities at the moment, Kylie.
Here, grab a box.
No.
I think this is something you're really gonna want to see.
This better be good.
Okay, Fargo, what's the big emergency?
The corruption of the democratic process.
Everyone knows Herrera's in Thorne's pocket.
And now she's harassing my candidate.
Look.
- What are you talking about?
- It's my wall of fame.
Thorne took it.
She redacted all the photos of Eureka's founders.
She doesn't want the voters to see how connected Vincent is to this town's history.
- Why would she do that?
- Why?
Herrera checked out.
There's nothing in his background having to do with solar energy or fusion power.
Great.
So we got two suns and no suspect.
And now apparently no air conditioning.
Get anything off Herrera?
Other than a creepy politician vibe, no.
No, nothing.
- What did you find?
- Well, I ran some scans.
The sun has all the properties of a main sequence dwarf star.
The big question is its energy source.
Well, I might be able to shed some light on that.
I ordered copies of all records having to do with the hidden facility under Tesla.
Now, of course, Eva's either had them redacted or they don't exist.
But she forgot one thing.
Accounting.
Oh, somebody messed up their lunch receipt.
The DOD keeps track of every penny that they spent.
So I thought I'd see where they were spending in 1939.
Check out the stuff they were ordering.
Deuterium.
Tritium.
These are heavy hydrogen atoms.
Yeah, and the essential elements in building fusion bombs.
So Thorne dug up an old bomb testing facility?
We gotta get into that room before Thorne does her thermal cleaning thing.
To do what exactly?
To figure out whether something down there is causing what's up here.
Hurry up.
It's over here.
Kylie, it's a billion degrees out.
I don't have time to play house.
Excuse me.
I'm nine and I'm a junior.
I don't play house.
Then what are we doing here?
Take a look.
Kylie, can you remind me what our assignment was?
Build a working model of the solar system.
Took that a bit literally, did you?
How'd you get all the planets to orbit like that?
They are not the problem.
The sun's a little off.
We are so getting an "A".
One small issue.
I can't make it stop.
So we're not getting an "A"?
Yeah, not so much.
You know what, a controlled fusion reaction like this takes real talent.
Well, it wasn't even that hard.
Take a gravitron field generator, surround it in a little reactor plasma, heat and serve.
Served up kind of a big helping, don't you think?
Well, we're a little off on the plasma density.
We?
Oh no, no, no.
See, I didn't do this.
And I'm gonna need you to resign from the campaign.
We can't afford the scandal.
Thanks for the support, partner.
Henry, I got a town full of cranky people who need some sleep.
You got any ideas?
Yeah, make it do what it's supposed to do.
It should've started to dissipate by now.
Well, it's... it's getting some fuel from somewhere.
Chances are it'll burn itself out.
But in the meantime, I'm gonna go back to my garage and research just how fast.
- Thanks.
Let me know what you found.
- Can I come?
I want to help.
I think you helped enough already today, don't you?
I tell you what, you can take atmospheric readings, okay?
Great.
Great.
So what convinced you?
Oh, Eva had all the old photos removed from Café Diem.
Add that to the mass redaction of old GD records...
And making Jo shut down the Eureka museum.
And having me and Henry dig up this place.
They're all windows into Eureka's past.
Windows Thorne seems to want shut.
Let's find out why.
Focus on our constituents.
No swag for seniors.
We're on a budget.
Hey, Kylie, look, about earlier.
- You mean when you sold me out?
- You made a second sun.
- You told me to take the lead.
- I was being nice.
Like all politicians, you'll say whatever it takes to get what you want.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have work to do.
The radiogenic detection field reads negative for fusion products.
That good or bad?
It means we're not being radiated.
Rats.
That's definitely a good thing, Carter.
No, I mean, literally.
Rats.
- You got somethin' you want to say?
- No.
Okay, come on.
Henry said that the second sun was getting fuel from somewhere.
- Is it down here?
- Well, if it is, I'm not finding it.
Can't believe this place has been under us all these years.
It's like a door into Eureka's past.
Look at this.
That's the door we saw in the security photos.
All right,
- let's unlock it.
- My specialty.
So how long do you need?
This long.
These old school locks are no match for a 20 zettahertz processor.
Okay.
This is a bit of a letdown.
Why order a thermal cleaning of an empty room?
Good point.
Maybe it wasn't always empty.
Can I see the light scanner thingy?
One biotelemetric dispersion scanner.
Yes.
Okay.
Coming up.
This baby reads patterns of movement left behind by organic materials.
All right, let's see who's been in here.
Look at that.
The dust layer means that these prints are old.
But these high heels are definitely new.
So are the military boots.
Looks like they were moving stuff out.
Like what?
- Like them.
- Oh, my God.
- Are those...
- Bodies?
Carter, hand me the scanner.
These bodies were removed in the last 24 hours.
We have to find out who they were and what they were doing down here.
And why Thorne was trying to hide them.
This facility is classified and scheduled for thermal cleaning.
Yet here you are violating direct orders.
I'd except this kind of insubordination from you, Sheriff.
- Thank you.
- But from you two...
I've always had a bit of trouble with authority.
As far as I'm concerned, this just became an active crime scene.
Oh, this is out of your jurisdiction, Sheriff.
I'd be happy to have the DOD remind you of that.
And I'd be happy to tell them why.
- You tryin' to bluff me?
- No, he's not, because he's leaving.
- We all are.
- No, actually.
- We're not.
- Carter, we crossed the line.
Let's not make it any worse.
- You sure about this?
- Sorry.
Okay.
- I can't believe Allison backed down.
- Yeah, me neither.
Now Thorne has all the evidence.
I wouldn't say all the evidence.
I yanked the chip from the dispersion scanner before they took my stuff.
We can see images of everything we scanned.
Nice.
That's definitely not good.
Really?
Based on my initial data, it should've burned itself out hours ago.
That doesn't look like it's burning out.
It looks like it's getting hotter.
I'm melting.
It's midnight and 110 in the shade.
- People are getting pretty testy.
- Yeah, me included.
It reminds me of tornado weather.
I have a really bad feeling about this.
Well, just keep everybody calm and preferably indoors.
Roger that.
Kylie is gathering atmospheric data.
I should know something soon.
All right.
Zane's working on it too.
And in the meantime, Thorne's wiping out any evidence that connects her to these bodies.
- Any idea who they were?
- I'm getting conflicting information.
How so?
From the surveillance photos, their approximate age is somewhere between 35 and 45 when they entered the room in 1939.
- All right.
With you so far.
- The organic residue that you scanned establishes that they also died in 1939.
So they were buried there for 70 years?
Yeah, here's the really puzzling thing.
Common sense says they were around 40 when they died.
But based on these readings, their biological age is somewhere around 80.
I want someone posted outside that facility at all times.
Nobody comes in until after the thermal cleaning.
Let's get the bodies ready for transport.
Transport?
To where?
I'm afraid it's classified information, Allison, as is everything in this room.
And I'd really appreciate it if you leave now.
You said that you considered us to be friends.
I do too.
So why don't you just tell me who those men are?
I know what it looks like from where you stand, but it's not what you think.
These were good men who gave their lives for this town.
And it could've been prevented.
You make it sound as if you knew them.
It's time for you to go now.
- Why are you doing this?
- Because I have to.
Dr. Deacon, there's something I think you're really gonna want to see.
Well, please tell me you didn't make another sun.
No, I've been trying to figure out how to extinguish the first one.
- You mean the second one.
- Semantics?
Really, Sheriff?
Could we just...
Kylie, what did you find?
Well, I've been doing readings all over town and the upper air is saturated with excess hydrogen.
- Is that bad?
- Well, not by itself.
But mixed with Kylie's project, hydrogen could cause a whopping fusion reaction.
Well, how whopping are we talking?
Well, depending on the source and how much is left, big.
Look, I don't know where this hydrogen is coming from, but I promise I didn't do it.
That's okay.
I have a pretty good idea who did.
There's no way my clouds caused this.
Well, it's not the clouds themselves.
It's what's inside of them.
- It's a whole lot of hydrogen, right?
- Well, not that much.
Maybe 1,000 liters at standard temperature and pressure.
Well, you've been outside.
It's plenty.
How was I supposed to know someone'd be creating a stellar fusion reaction?
Hello.
You live in Eureka.
I guess this means I won't be getting your endorsement.
Well, it's...
Just stick to the problem.
Is this how you deliver the nanos to make your clouds?
Yep.
A single stage booster that fuels the cold accelerant mixer for better saturation and heat dispersion.
- Nice.
- We gotta fix this.
Can you reverse it?
You mean exsanguinate the excess hydrogen from Eureka's lower atmosphere?
- Yes.
- No.
I mean, I can make any shape you want, but once the clouds have seeded, natural hydration processes take over.
I say we enjoy the extra sunlight while we can.
It'll burn itself out soon enough.
You were saying?
It should've extinguished itself.
But it didn't.
That's because Kylie's sun...
Ingenious though it is... has evolved from a dwarf star and is developing into a red super giant.
- Which means?
- Instead of burning out, it's blowing up big time.
Not my fault entirely.
It's not stopping there.
The sun flares are just the beginning.
And we only have a few hours before it goes critical.
Okay, what are our options?
If we can launch a dispersion module, a concentration of iron atoms fired directly into the sun's core
- should cause it to implode.
- And imploding's a good thing?
Yes.
Once the sun's incapable of fusion reaction, then, we'll all be safe.
What if it doesn't work?
We all get front row seats to a supernova way bigger than Hiroshima.
And Eureka becomes a mile deep crater.
That's too risky.
We need to evacuate now.
Y...
Jo's already started.
But this is also the most advanced research complex on the planet and we have an opportunity to save it.
And I'm already developing a compound to trigger the implosion.
- And I'm working on a delivery system.
- Towns can be rebuilt.
People can't.
Which is why we're evacuating the people while we're trying to save the town.
Sheriff, you might be comfortable risking lives, but I'm not.
Make sure everybody gets out while there's time.
Eva, we have a chance to save decades of research.
That wasn't a request.
It's like she wants to see the place go up in flames.
I think she might.
Well, what now?
Let's go, people!
Move!
Move!
Shuttles are waiting outside.
Let's go!
You know what, after the election, we'll have the influence around.
- Maybe I can up your pay rate.
- Don't make me use the stun gun.
You heard her, Fargo.
Keep moving.
Everybody move.
But we're just making sure his constituents are safely away first.
How come you two aren't drenched like the rest of us?
Oh, a worthy candidate is always cool under pressure, Sheriff.
And it's classified.
However, I could be convinced to share my secret for, say, your endorsement.
This is mine.
Both of you on the bus.
Go.
Go!
Everybody move!
Keep goin'!
Sounds like we're using sunscreen to beat injustice.
- Just smile and look pretty.
- Zo, what are you doin'?
You gotta go.
Guys, please.
Not yet.
Latest election polls only show Lucas down by two points.
You wanna score points with the voters or with your girlfriend's old man?
No contest, sir.
- That'll work.
- Vote Lucas!
All right, everybody's cleared out.
Any luck?
- We're locked and loaded, Sheriff.
- XRT online and ready.
It'll take two people to get the module in position for launch.
I can do that on my own.
No.
I'll go with you.
I know this baby best.
Okay.
All right.
You three get to an evacuation site.
- Nice work.
- Thanks.
- Be careful.
- Thanks.
Could you keep an eye on Lex and Zoe?
Of course.
Just come back safely.
Thanks.
We're at a safe distance from town.
We can move everyone quickly if we need to, but with... ten evac camps for 2,600 people.
Things are gonna get crowded.
How are you feelin'?
I just wish someone would do something about the heat.
I hear your pain.
This town needs a Mayor who can be cool in a crisis.
And if I'm elected, I promise I won't sleep until darkness falls again on Eureka.
Oh, please.
You don't need stale campaign promises.
You need ideas that are fresh as baked bread, which by the way, Vincent also provides twice daily.
Say no to half-baked science and overbaked bread.
- Lucas is your man.
- Can't bake his way out of a paper bag.
- Like cloud makers...
- What is wrong with all of you?
Eureka was founded to protect the greater good.
You're worried about votes.
You should be worried about lives.
You cannot be a leader if there is no town to lead.
So I suggest you get your priorities straight.
That was beautiful.
Having fun yet?
Driving headlong into a fiery death is everybody's idea of a good time.
Sometimes I think it's his.
Carter, could we have a minute?
Sure.
Jo, you're supposed to be miles away at an evac camp by now.
I should risk my life more often.
I prefer you didn't.
Come on, Josefina, don't go all serious on me now.
It's too late.
- I thought we agreed to evacuate.
- We did.
What are you still doing here?
None of your business.
Don't play games.
I'm not.
I think Zane's device is gonna work.
- Probably.
- If you don't die first.
That is part of the job.
And the men in that bunker would know that.
Whatever it is you think you know about what you found or about me, it's wrong.
Maybe.
But I'm just gettin' started.
If there's one thing I learned in life is that nobody should be left behind, no matter what the reason.
And that includes you.
Ms Thorne, I'm duty bound to enforce this evacuation.
Jo, make sure she gets out of town safely.
And no, that's not a request.
That looks pretty bad.
You sure the rocket can handle it?
An untested delivery system aimed at an out of control mini sun.
What could go wrong?
Ready?
It's fried.
I'll call Allison.
Okay, Carter, what's wrong?
Zane's module.
Electronics are fried.
Do you have any spares lying around?
GD has plenty of short range booster assemblies.
We just need to adapt them to the XRT's specifications.
- We'll never make it back in time.
- There is another way.
Dr. Herrera's hydrogen seeding device.
It uses similar boosters to the XRT.
But my greenhouse is too close to that sun.
And there's no way they'll ever survive the heat.
Well, hold on.
Maybe there is.
- What are you thinking?
- Well, like Fargo said earlier.
We just need to stay cool under pressure.
I've been workin' on this heat protection formula for weeks.
- Sure that'll work?
- It's a prototype.
But it's overengineered to respond to increased body heat and adrenaline.
Takin' on a supernova so we should have plenty of both.
All you gotta do is slather it on.
We should have a good 10, maybe 15 minutes before we combust.
Fantastic.
That's gettin' worst.
- Then why are you slowing' down?
- I'm not.
You smell burning rubber?
Gonna have to run for it.
Dude, it's like 2 zillion degrees out there.
- Okay, I'm game.
- You do anything normal for fun?
I play a wicked game of yahtzee.
Put that gel on thick if you know what's good for ya.
You ready?
I feel like a lobster in here.
Temp's climbing.
If we stay long, we'll boil.
Find that rocket.
- It might help if I could see anything.
- Keep looking!
Got it!
Got it!
Yep!
Right!
This way.
And... set.
We only get one shot at this.
I don't wanna miss.
Using GPS to target?
- I was gonna eyeball it.
- Oh, stellar.
Whatever happens, it's been fun.
No, it hasn't.
Push the button.
Take a look at that.
That is quite a sunset.
So you managed to pull it off.
You sound disappointed.
Someone cancelled the thermal cleaning.
I wonder who.
You may have the backing of the DOD, but these people still work for me.
- And you work for me.
- Not without an explanation.
- Those bodies...
- Are my concern.
You're asking me to trust you, but you're giving me nothing.
Well, I'll give you some advice.
History has a way of haunting you no matter how far you run.
This is mine and I'm putting it to rest.
So you stay out of my way.
Listen, whoever wins, it was nice doing battle with you.
After all this, I don't even care who wins anymore.
- As long as one of us buries that guy.
- Amen to that.
Hey, partner.
Thanks for the save.
Fiery death not popular with voters.
I caused it.
It's the least I could do.
My fault too.
I got so caught up in everything when I should've been helping you.
- This time I'll make it up to you.
- This time?
Well, we have to make a new model.
And someone should make sure I don't destroy the universe.
So...
Partners?
- Glad to see you're okay.
- Me too.
- Look, about before...
- It's cool, Jo.
It was a crisis.
You were caught up in the moment.
No, I wasn't.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Way to go, Sheriff.
So how's the...
Itchy.
Hope that means it's healing well.
Listen, what... you and Zane did was a brave...
mythic.
Maybe selfish.
- I'm growing attached to the town.
- This town, is fortunate to have you to protect it.
- I'm just doin' my job.
- And...
Thorne?
I'm workin' on it.
May I have your attention, please?
'scuse me.
Everyone, can I have your attention, please?
Everyone.
Quiet!
Thank you.
All the ballots are in.
It was a very close race.
But after a late night surge at the polling booths, our new mayor elect is...
Mr. Henry Deacon.
Seriously?
No, wait.
I wasn't even on the ballot.
I kinda started a write-in campaign.
And someone gave you their official endorsement.
You're welcome.
I don't know...
- What to say.
- Say that you'll take the job because Zoe's boyfriend is the runner up.
Clearly this is a surprise.
I'm not one for making campaign promises.
But I will say this.
What makes Eureka special is not the ideal behind it,
but you.
This community.
This family that I'm very proud to be a part of.
And it's this family that I promise to protect no matter what.
Thank you.
See.
Sometimes the system does work.
Previously on Eureka
What Sheriff Subtle's trying to tell you is that...
I'm pregnant.
I have a new puzzle for you to solve.
This complex is massive.
- Prewar.
What, late 30's?
- I believe.
It's before Eureka was built.
What's down there?
Ever since you got to this town, you've been looking for something.
Tell me what's going on.
No.
- I have to what?
- Oversee the mayoral election.
This is the official polling place.
It's not a big deal, Carter.
- Well, now why can't Jo do it?
- Because Jo's not your lackey.
Well, the town charter says that voting security falls on the highest ranking law enforcement officer.
That would be you.
Unless you promote me or become otherwise incapacitated.
The Mayor's seat has been open for over a year.
The town needs a voice.
This is a very important service card.
How important can it be?
I mean, my daughter's backing her 17-year-old boyfriend for the job.
Eureka doesn't discriminate.
Some of our smartest citizens are teens.
So instead of working, I have to sit here and count ballots for some doogie Mayor?
No, actually, your sister volunteered for that job.
It's a bad idea.
Lex becomes really obsessed with politics.
And her mood swings are already out of hand.
Actually, she's really into it.
And you should be more sensitive.
- Your sister's pregnant.
- I'm Mr. Sensitive.
Like...
What...
Paper ballots?
Digital voting machines are way too easy to tamper with.
And campaigns get really competitive around here.
Okay.
I'll do it.
I'm...
I'm...
- Thank you.
- Mr. Sensitive though.
Oh, my goodness.
What a beautiful baby.
Love that shirt.
There we go.
More Vinspresso?
Remember, vote Vincent.
Great.
They love you!
I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
I hate politics.
We're the glue that holds this town together, Vincent.
It's time we had a voice.
Smile.
- That's great, thanks.
- All right.
Now back to kissin' babies.
A vote for Lucas is a vote for youthful innovation.
Oh, here's his ten point plan.
Kylie, can you help me pass out some more buttons, please?
Then can we work on our lab project?
What's more important, Kylie, homework or changing the world?
I don't know, Zoe.
- I've never been much of a leader.
- Which is why you have me.
That baby face of yours promises idealism and hope for all the minors of the town.
And I am going to help you deliver it.
- You mean manipulate it.
- Tomay-to.
Tomah-to.
Sheriff Carter.
Halo Herrera.
Nephrologist, concerned citizen, and future mayor of Eureka.
Well, you don't see that combo platter everyday.
I'd like to talk about your endorsement.
I'm getting coffee.
- Could...
- Not your lackey.
Well, I...
Mr. Herrera is it?
I would love to endorse somebody, but...
But he's already promised his endorsement...
- To my candidate, right, Sheriff?
- Actually...
Eureka needs a mayor who understands how a company town works.
Why?
So your boss can have some Global Dynamics puppet to sell out the town?
How many people is Thorne gonna fire?
So Vincent is the best candidate, he's all about nurturing the community.
Guys!
I just want my coffee.
Vincent, get Sheriff Carter a Vinspresso on the house.
It's already on the house and bribery is a crime.
Yeah.
Nice try, Fargo.
Do we amuse you, Herrera?
Watch and learn, kids.
Folks, would everybody follow me outside?
I have something that will entertain and amaze you.
Okay.
I'm done.
Now can we talk about our project?
I've got some damage control to do.
- Why don't you just get it started?
- But we're supposed to work together.
We will after you've shown me what you've got.
- So you're letting me take lead?
- That's right.
Now get to work, partner.
Leave professional politics to the professionals.
- Told you it gets competitive.
- That's just wrong.
- Big news, guys.
- Yeah, what's up?
Those ancient security cameras we saw in the bunker,
I pulled the negatives before Thorne locked the place up again.
It's 35 millimeter.
We just have to find someone old enough to develop it.
What?
The latest next gen technology Zane's been developing for our sponsor.
Overengineered to keep you cool in the hottest situations.
It's amazing what the greatest minds and a big old corporate check can buy.
Too bad we can't buy the next mayoral election.
Just kidding, Allison.
I would, however, like you to endorse Dr. Herrera.
Well, won't that be seen as Global Dynamics taking sides?
Maybe.
But on the other hand, having someone to smooth ruffled feathers during the next round of cutbacks isn't a bad idea.
Well, I prefer to make up my own mind.
You should also think about what's best for Global.
We need a personal relationship with the town.
One that shows that we're all on the same team.
Are you and I on the same team, Eva?
Of course.
I'd like to think we're also friends.
Good.
So why don't you tell me what's in the bunker under Tesla.
We found bariogenic radiation.
Zoe and her friends are very lucky that they weren't infected.
That's why I'm ordering a thermal cleaning of the entire facility.
You realize you'll destroy any organic material that's left inside.
Our first obligation is to the town.
Excuse me.
Make sure you vote.
This is Allison Blake.
I need some records from the archive.
What a time suck this is.
How did we live before digital?
I never knew you had an artistic side, Carter.
I'm a man of many facets.
Check out the date stamp.
1939.
I thought Eureka wasn't founded till 1950.
Well, it wasn't.
What were they doin' down there?
Well, whatever it was, they tried to bury it for good.
Look who we have here.
- SARAH, lights.
- Certainly, Sheriff.
That was yesterday?
Thorne's been lookin' for somethin' ever since she came to Eureka.
How much you wanna bet it's in this room?
So what is she up to?
That's gonna have to wait till tomorrow.
The debate's about to start.
- You prepare your opening remarks?
- What opening remarks?
Hello.
Hello.
Is this on?
Hi, everyone.
Welcome to debate night.
- I'm Sheriff Carter and I'll be...
- Cut to the chase!
We want issues, not filler!
Thank you, Lexi, for your wildly inappropriate enthusiasm.
So without further ado, I give you your candidates.
And if elected, I'll bring the same principles to the mayor's office as I do to Café Diem.
In short, you want it, I got it!
I promise to bring a voice to the pre-teen prodigy that the establishment too often sees as just another pretty brain.
Times are changing and Eureka must change with it.
I will protect the tenets on which this town was founded and help usher in a new day for Eureka.
It's a new day all right.
Season 3 Episode 7 Here Come the Suns (v 1.00)
Team Projet-SG.
Just another days in Eureka.
Well, it's a mini sun.
Really?
Took you all night to come up with that?
No.
It took us all night to rule out any GD experiments as the cause.
- So now we have two suns.
- Just like Tatooine.
- Tatu-what?
- Geek speak.
The good news is it's stable holding its position at about 1,000 feet.
We're not lighting the entire state.
The last thing we need is a spotlight on the town the whole world can see.
Well, agree.
But it's 6:00 AM.
And 90 degrees.
How do we turn it off?
I'm not sure yet.
It has to be some kind of fusion reaction.
- Sounds dangerous.
- No, not necessarily.
Based on its containment, I'd say it's deliberate.
Who'd want to make a second sun on purpose?
Maybe the guy who was trying to make a big bang at the debates.
Oh, cloud guy.
Herrera.
Eva wanted me to endorse him.
- Such a hidden agenda.
- What do you mean?
Zane found some security photos of her sneaking around the facility.
- What's down there anyway?
- Well, nothing for long.
She ordered a thermal cleaning.
Can we stop it till we get inside?
No, she's forbidden access.
The whole place is classified.
Something's goin' on.
You go talk to Herrera.
I'll look into it.
Yes, Allison Blake.
She asked for me?
Okay.
I'm on my way.
- Hot enough for you?
- Yeah.
What's with the umbrellas?
He likes to be prepared?
Did that just come from inside?
That would be yes.
You changed your mind about that endorsement?
Not really.
What is this?
This is the end to drought, which we may be needing sooner than later.
Welcome to my cloud farm.
Cloud farm?
Yeah, that's...
That's what he said.
I'm taking Cloud City to a whole new level with nanotech hydration.
Cumulus, stratus, cirrus, I can create 'em all.
Like you did with the cloud gag yesterday.
Nice, huh?
I found a way to hydrogenically infuse the atmosphere so I can sculpt clouds.
The commercial applications are limitless.
Well, I'm more concerned about your sun stunt.
Sun?
No, no.
I'm a cloud guy.
Not that I don't mind the bump in the polling numbers.
People love a spectacle.
Yeah, but you have to admit the timing was suspicious.
Have anyone from Global come and review my record.
My life is an open book, Sheriff.
I'm beholden to my constituents.
Gotta admit, it's a hell of a show.
Zane.
Just the man I'm lookin' for.
Save your breath, Fargo.
I already know who I'm voting for.
I'm offended.
You think I'm only here to get your vote?
- You're not?
- No.
I also want a favor.
It is roasting out there.
A candidate has to project cool confidence under the most extreme conditions.
I hear you're beta testing something that can help with staying cool.
- Yeah, I might be.
- Give me enough to get through the election and if...
when Vincent wins,
I'll name a park bench after you.
Tempting, but no.
I don't do politics.
But good luck with that.
Based on these sun scans, I'd say your competition's definitely heating up.
I was testing the voting machines and I got dizzy.
I know you're not an OB.
Not really a fan of western medicine.
- But I trust you.
- Well, I'm flattered.
I'm sure you have much bigger issues to deal with.
Yes, and I have people to deal with them.
So let's put your mind at ease.
So Carter says you've always been interested in politics.
He said I'm obsessed, didn't he?
No.
Jack thinks the system is broken.
But I think it's up to us to make the system work.
Well, this little guy's system is working perfectly.
Here.
Want to take a look?
It's amazing.
- What, is something wrong?
- I think I figured out why your hormones are so out of whack.
You're getting a double dose.
Lexi, you're having twins.
Both boys.
Two sons?
Two suns.
Why didn't I think of that?
- Because it's crazy.
- It's brilliant.
Lucas, I don't think you appreciate what's at stake here.
I mean, the mayor's office oversees City hall.
- So?
- So...
That includes the Sheriff's department.
You could be my dad's boss.
- And I thought he hated me now.
- It's time to step up our game.
When the world hands you suns, make sunscreen.
Iced mocha, folks.
Stays cool as Vincent will be when he takes the oath of office.
Suits?
It's over 100 degrees out here.
Some candidates can handle the heat better than others.
Nice gimmick.
We're just helping the voters stay refreshed so they can make a cogent decision at the polling booth.
We're just trying to protect voters from harmful UV rays so they won't be blinded by indecision.
- Iced mocha!
Get it while it's cold.
- Sunscreen, people.
Vote lucas and say no to premature aging.
Zoe, I've had a small issue with our class project.
Bigger priorities at the moment, Kylie.
Here, grab a box.
No.
I think this is something you're really gonna want to see.
This better be good.
Okay, Fargo, what's the big emergency?
The corruption of the democratic process.
Everyone knows Herrera's in Thorne's pocket.
And now she's harassing my candidate.
Look.
- What are you talking about?
- It's my wall of fame.
Thorne took it.
She redacted all the photos of Eureka's founders.
She doesn't want the voters to see how connected Vincent is to this town's history.
- Why would she do that?
- Why?
Herrera checked out.
There's nothing in his background having to do with solar energy or fusion power.
Great.
So we got two suns and no suspect.
And now apparently no air conditioning.
Get anything off Herrera?
Other than a creepy politician vibe, no.
No, nothing.
- What did you find?
- Well, I ran some scans.
The sun has all the properties of a main sequence dwarf star.
The big question is its energy source.
Well, I might be able to shed some light on that.
I ordered copies of all records having to do with the hidden facility under Tesla.
Now, of course, Eva's either had them redacted or they don't exist.
But she forgot one thing.
Accounting.
Oh, somebody messed up their lunch receipt.
The DOD keeps track of every penny that they spent.
So I thought I'd see where they were spending in 1939.
Check out the stuff they were ordering.
Deuterium.
Tritium.
These are heavy hydrogen atoms.
Yeah, and the essential elements in building fusion bombs.
So Thorne dug up an old bomb testing facility?
We gotta get into that room before Thorne does her thermal cleaning thing.
To do what exactly?
To figure out whether something down there is causing what's up here.
Hurry up.
It's over here.
Kylie, it's a billion degrees out.
I don't have time to play house.
Excuse me.
I'm nine and I'm a junior.
I don't play house.
Then what are we doing here?
Take a look.
Kylie, can you remind me what our assignment was?
Build a working model of the solar system.
Took that a bit literally, did you?
How'd you get all the planets to orbit like that?
They are not the problem.
The sun's a little off.
We are so getting an "A".
One small issue.
I can't make it stop.
So we're not getting an "A"?
Yeah, not so much.
You know what, a controlled fusion reaction like this takes real talent.
Well, it wasn't even that hard.
Take a gravitron field generator, surround it in a little reactor plasma, heat and serve.
Served up kind of a big helping, don't you think?
Well, we're a little off on the plasma density.
We?
Oh no, no, no.
See, I didn't do this.
And I'm gonna need you to resign from the campaign.
We can't afford the scandal.
Thanks for the support, partner.
Henry, I got a town full of cranky people who need some sleep.
You got any ideas?
Yeah, make it do what it's supposed to do.
It should've started to dissipate by now.
Well, it's...
It's getting some fuel from somewhere.
Chances are it'll burn itself out.
But in the meantime, I'm gonna go back to my garage and research just how fast.
- Thanks.
Let me know what you found.
- Can I come?
I want to help.
I think you helped enough already today, don't you?
I tell you what, you can take atmospheric readings, okay?
Great.
Great.
So what convinced you?
Oh, Eva had all the old photos removed from Café Diem.
Add that to the mass redaction of old GD records...
And making Jo shut down the Eureka museum.
And having me and Henry dig up this place.
They're all windows into Eureka's past.
Windows Thorne seems to want shut.
Let's find out why.
Focus on our constituents.
No swag for seniors.
We're on a budget.
Hey, Kylie, look, about earlier.
- You mean when you sold me out?
- You made a second sun.
- You told me to take the lead.
- I was being nice.
Like all politicians, you'll say whatever it takes to get what you want.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have work to do.
The radiogenic detection field reads negative for fusion products.
That good or bad?
It means we're not being radiated.
Rats.
That's definitely a good thing, Carter.
No, I mean, literally.
Rats.
- You got somethin' you want to say?
- No.
Okay, come on.
Henry said that the second sun was getting fuel from somewhere.
- Is it down here?
- Well, if it is, I'm not finding it.
Can't believe this place has been under us all these years.
It's like a door into Eureka's past.
Look at this.
That's the door we saw in the security photos.
All right,
- let's unlock it.
- My specialty.
So how long do you need?
This long.
These old school locks are no match for a 20 zettahertz processor.
Okay.
This is a bit of a letdown.
Why order a thermal cleaning of an empty room?
Good point.
Maybe it wasn't always empty.
Can I see the light scanner thingy?
One biotelemetric dispersion scanner.
Yes.
Okay.
Coming up.
This baby reads patterns of movement left behind by organic materials.
All right, let's see who's been in here.
Look at that.
The dust layer means that these prints are old.
But these high heels are definitely new.
So are the military boots.
Looks like they were moving stuff out.
Like what?
- Like them.
- Oh, my God.
- Are those...
- Bodies?
Carter, hand me the scanner.
These bodies were removed in the last 24 hours.
We have to find out who they were and what they were doing down here.
And why Thorne was trying to hide them.
This facility is classified and scheduled for thermal cleaning.
Yet here you are violating direct orders.
I'd except this kind of insubordination from you, Sheriff.
- Thank you.
- But from you two...
I've always had a bit of trouble with authority.
As far as I'm concerned, this just became an active crime scene.
Oh, this is out of your jurisdiction, Sheriff.
I'd be happy to have the DOD remind you of that.
And I'd be happy to tell them why.
- You tryin' to bluff me?
- No, he's not, because he's leaving.
- We all are.
- No, actually.
- We're not.
- Carter, we crossed the line.
Let's not make it any worse.
- You sure about this?
- Sorry.
Okay.
- I can't believe Allison backed down.
- Yeah, me neither.
Now Thorne has all the evidence.
I wouldn't say all the evidence.
I yanked the chip from the dispersion scanner before they took my stuff.
We can see images of everything we scanned.
Nice.
That's definitely not good.
Really?
Based on my initial data, it should've burned itself out hours ago.
That doesn't look like it's burning out.
It looks like it's getting hotter.
I'm melting.
It's midnight and 110 in the shade.
- People are getting pretty testy.
- Yeah, me included.
It reminds me of tornado weather.
I have a really bad feeling about this.
Well, just keep everybody calm and preferably indoors.
Roger that.
Kylie is gathering atmospheric data.
I should know something soon.
All right.
Zane's working on it too.
And in the meantime, Thorne's wiping out any evidence that connects her to these bodies.
- Any idea who they were?
- I'm getting conflicting information.
How so?
From the surveillance photos, their approximate age is somewhere between 35 and 45 when they entered the room in 1939.
- All right.
With you so far.
- The organic residue that you scanned establishes that they also died in 1939.
So they were buried there for 70 years?
Yeah, here's the really puzzling thing.
Common sense says they were around 40 when they died.
But based on these readings, their biological age is somewhere around 80.
I want someone posted outside that facility at all times.
Nobody comes in until after the thermal cleaning.
Let's get the bodies ready for transport.
Transport?
To where?
I'm afraid it's classified information, Allison, as is everything in this room.
And I'd really appreciate it if you leave now.
You said that you considered us to be friends.
I do too.
So why don't you just tell me who those men are?
I know what it looks like from where you stand, but it's not what you think.
These were good men who gave their lives for this town.
And it could've been prevented.
You make it sound as if you knew them.
It's time for you to go now.
- Why are you doing this?
- Because I have to.
Dr. Deacon, there's something I think you're really gonna want to see.
Well, please tell me you didn't make another sun.
No, I've been trying to figure out how to extinguish the first one.
- You mean the second one.
- Semantics?
Really, Sheriff?
Could we just...
Kylie, what did you find?
Well, I've been doing readings all over town and the upper air is saturated with excess hydrogen.
- Is that bad?
- Well, not by itself.
But mixed with Kylie's project, hydrogen could cause a whopping fusion reaction.
Well, how whopping are we talking?
Well, depending on the source and how much is left, big.
Look, I don't know where this hydrogen is coming from, but I promise I didn't do it.
That's okay.
I have a pretty good idea who did.
There's no way my clouds caused this.
Well, it's not the clouds themselves.
It's what's inside of them.
- It's a whole lot of hydrogen, right?
- Well, not that much.
Maybe 1,000 liters at standard temperature and pressure.
Well, you've been outside.
It's plenty.
How was I supposed to know someone'd be creating a stellar fusion reaction?
Hello.
You live in Eureka.
I guess this means I won't be getting your endorsement.
Well, it's...
Just stick to the problem.
Is this how you deliver the nanos to make your clouds?
Yep.
A single stage booster that fuels the cold accelerant mixer for better saturation and heat dispersion.
- Nice.
- We gotta fix this.
Can you reverse it?
You mean exsanguinate the excess hydrogen from Eureka's lower atmosphere?
- Yes.
- No.
I mean, I can make any shape you want, but once the clouds have seeded, natural hydration processes take over.
I say we enjoy the extra sunlight while we can.
It'll burn itself out soon enough.
You were saying?
It should've extinguished itself.
But it didn't.
That's because Kylie's sun...
Ingenious though it is... has evolved from a dwarf star and is developing into a red super giant.
- Which means?
- Instead of burning out, it's blowing up big time.
Not my fault entirely.
It's not stopping there.
The sun flares are just the beginning.
And we only have a few hours before it goes critical.
Okay, what are our options?
If we can launch a dispersion module, a concentration of iron atoms fired directly into the sun's core
- should cause it to implode.
- And imploding's a good thing?
Yes.
Once the sun's incapable of fusion reaction, then, we'll all be safe.
What if it doesn't work?
We all get front row seats to a supernova way bigger than Hiroshima.
And Eureka becomes a mile deep crater.
That's too risky.
We need to evacuate now.
Y...
Jo's already started.
But this is also the most advanced research complex on the planet and we have an opportunity to save it.
And I'm already developing a compound to trigger the implosion.
- And I'm working on a delivery system.
- Towns can be rebuilt.
People can't.
Which is why we're evacuating the people while we're trying to save the town.
You might be comfortable risking lives, but I'm not.
Make sure everybody gets out while there's time.
Eva, we have a chance to save decades of research.
That wasn't a request.
It's like she wants to see the place go up in flames.
I think she might.
Well, what now?
Let's go, people!
Move!
Move!
Shuttles are waiting outside.
Let's go!
You know what, after the election, we'll have the influence around.
- Maybe I can up your pay rate.
- Don't make me use the stun gun.
You heard her, Fargo.
Keep moving.
Everybody move.
But we're just making sure his constituents are safely away first.
How come you two aren't drenched like the rest of us?
Oh, a worthy candidate is always cool under pressure, Sheriff.
And it's classified.
However, I could be convinced to share my secret for, say, your endorsement.
This is mine.
Both of you on the bus.
Go.
Go!
Everybody move!
Keep goin'!
Sounds like we're using sunscreen to beat injustice.
- Just smile and look pretty.
- Zo, what are you doin'?
You gotta go.
Guys, please.
Not yet.
Latest election polls only show Lucas down by two points.
You wanna score points with the voters or with your girlfriend's old man?
No contest, sir.
- That'll work.
- Vote Lucas!
All right, everybody's cleared out.
Any luck?
- We're locked and loaded, Sheriff.
- XRT online and ready.
It'll take two people to get the module in position for launch.
I can do that.
- I can do that on my own.
- No.
I'll go with you.
No.
I'll go with you.
I know this baby best.
Okay.
All right.
You three get to an evacuation site.
- Nice work.
- Thanks.
- Be careful.
- Thanks.
Could you keep an eye on Lex and Zoe?
Of course.
Just come back safely.
Thanks.
We're at a safe distance from town.
We can move everyone quickly if we need to, but with... ten evac camps for 2,600 people.
Things are gonna get crowded.
How are you feelin'?
I just wish someone would do something about the heat.
I hear your pain.
This town needs a Mayor who can be cool in a crisis.
And if I'm elected, I promise I won't sleep until darkness falls again on Eureka.
Oh, please.
You don't need stale campaign promises.
You need ideas that are fresh as baked bread, which by the way, Vincent also provides twice daily.
Say no to half-baked science and overbaked bread.
- Lucas is your man.
- Can't bake his way out of a paper bag.
- Like cloud makers...
- What is wrong with all of you?
Eureka was founded to protect the greater good.
You're worried about votes.
You should be worried about lives.
You cannot be a leader if there is no town to lead.
So I suggest you get your priorities straight.
That was beautiful.
Having fun yet?
Driving headlong into a fiery death is everybody's idea of a good time.
Sometimes I think it's his.
Carter, could we have a minute?
Sure.
Jo, you're supposed to be miles away at an evac camp by now.
I should risk my life more often.
I prefer you didn't.
Come on, Josefina, don't go all serious on me now.
It's too late.
- I thought we agreed to evacuate.
- We did.
What are you still doing here?
None of your business.
Don't play games.
I'm not.
I think Zane's device is gonna work.
- Probably.
- If you don't die first.
That is part of the job.
And the men in that bunker would know that.
Whatever it is you think you know about what you found or about me, it's wrong.
Maybe.
But I'm just gettin' started.
If there's one thing I learned in life is that nobody should be left behind, no matter what the reason.
And that includes you.
I'm duty bound to enforce this evacuation.
Jo, make sure she gets out of town safely.
And no, that's not a request.
That looks pretty bad.
You sure the rocket can handle it?
An untested delivery system aimed at an out of control mini sun.
What could go wrong?
Ready?
It's fried.
I'll call Allison.
Okay, Carter, what's wrong?
Zane's module.
Electronics are fried.
Do you have any spares lying around?
GD has plenty of short range booster assemblies.
We just need to adapt them to the XRT's specifications.
- We'll never make it back in time.
- There is another way.
Dr. Herrera's hydrogen seeding device.
It uses similar boosters to the XRT.
But my greenhouse is too close to that sun.
And there's no way they'll ever survive the heat.
Well, hold on.
Maybe there is.
- What are you thinking?
- Well, like Fargo said earlier.
We just need to stay cool under pressure.
I've been workin' on this heat protection formula for weeks.
- Sure that'll work?
- It's a prototype.
But it's overengineered to respond to increased body heat and adrenaline.
Takin' on a supernova so we should have plenty of both.
All you gotta do is slather it on.
We should have a good 10, maybe 15 minutes before we combust.
Fantastic.
That's gettin' worst.
- Then why are you slowing' down?
- I'm not.
You smell burning rubber?
Gonna have to run for it.
Dude, it's like 2 zillion degrees out there.
- Okay, I'm game.
- You do anything normal for fun?
I play a wicked game of yahtzee.
Put that gel on thick if you know what's good for ya.
You ready?
I feel like a lobster in here.
Temp's climbing.
If we stay long, we'll boil.
Find that rocket.
- It might help if I could see anything.
- Keep looking!
Got it!
Got it!
Yep!
Right!
This way.
And... set.
We only get one shot at this.
I don't wanna miss.
Using GPS to target?
- I was gonna eyeball it.
- Oh, stellar.
Whatever happens, it's been fun.
No, it hasn't.
Push the button.
Take a look at that.
That is quite a sunset.
So you managed to pull it off.
You sound disappointed.
Someone cancelled the thermal cleaning.
I wonder who.
You may have the backing of the DOD, but these people still work for me.
- And you work for me.
- Not without an explanation.
- Those bodies...
- Are my concern.
You're asking me to trust you, but you're giving me nothing.
Well, I'll give you some advice.
History has a way of haunting you no matter how far you run.
This is mine and I'm putting it to rest.
So you stay out of my way.
Listen, whoever wins, it was nice doing battle with you.
After all this, I don't even care who wins anymore.
- As long as one of us buries that guy.
- Amen to that.
Hey, partner.
Thanks for the save.
Fiery death not popular with voters.
I caused it.
It's the least I could do.
My fault too.
I got so caught up in everything when I should've been helping you.
- This time I'll make it up to you.
- This time?
Well, we have to make a new model.
And someone should make sure I don't destroy the universe.
So...
Partners?
- Glad to see you're okay.
- Me too.
- Look, about before...
- It's cool, Jo.
It was a crisis.
You were caught up in the moment.
No, I wasn't.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Way to go, Sheriff.
So how's the...
Itchy.
Hope that means it's healing well.
Listen, what... you and Zane did was a brave... mythic.
Maybe selfish.
- I'm growing attached to the town.
- This town, is fortunate to have you to protect it.
- I'm just doin' my job.
- And...
Thorne?
I'm workin' on it.
May I have your attention, please?
'scuse me.
Everyone, can I have your attention, please?
Everyone.
Quiet!
Thank you.
All the ballots are in.
It was a very close race.
But after a late night surge at the polling booths, our new mayor elect is...
Mr. Henry Deacon.
Seriously?
No, wait.
I wasn't even on the ballot.
I kinda started a write-in campaign.
And someone gave you their official endorsement.
You're welcome.
I don't know...
- What to say.
- Say that you'll take the job because Zoe's boyfriend is the runner up.
Clearly this is a surprise.
I'm not one for making campaign promises.
But I will say this.
What makes Eureka special is not the ideal behind it,
but you.
This community.
This family that I'm very proud to be a part of.
And it's this family that I promise to protect no matter what.
Thank you.
See.
Sometimes the system does work.
What sheriff subtle is trying to tell you
Is that I'm pregnant.
I have a new puzzle for you to solve.
This complex is massive. prewar.
What, late '30s?
I believe.
That's before eureka was built.
What's down there?
Mrs. thorne, ever since you got to this town,
You've been looking for something.
Tell me what's going on.
No.
I have to what?
Oversee the mayoral election.
This is the official polling place.
It's not a big deal, carter.
Well, now why can't jo do it?
Because jo's not your lackey.
Well, the town charter says
That voting security falls on the highest ranking
Law enforcement officer.
That would be you.
Unless you promote me
Or become otherwise incapacitated.
The mayor's seat has been open for over a year.
The town needs a voice.
This is a very important service card.
Well, how important can it be?
I mean, my daughter's backing
Her 17-year-old boyfriend for the job.
Eureka doesn't discriminate.
Some of our smartest citizens are teens.
So instead of working,
I have to sit here and count ballots
For some doogie mayor?
No, actually, your sister volunteered for that job.
Um, it's a bad idea.
Lex becomes really obsessed with politics.
And her mood swings are already out of hand.
Actually, she's really into it.
And you know what,
You should be a little more sensitive.
Your sister's pregnant.
I'm mr. sensitive.
Like...
What--paper ballots?
Digital voting machines are way too easy to tamper with.
And campaigns get
Really competitive around here.
Okay.
I'll do it.
I'm--i'm-- thank you.
Mr. sensitive though.
Oh, my goodness. what a beautiful baby.
Love that shirt. there we go.
Uh, more vinspresso?
remember, vote vincent.
You're doing great. they love you!
I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
I hate politics.
We're the glue that holds this town together, vincent.
- It's time we had a voice.
- Guys, smile here.
That's great!
Thanks!
All right. now back to kissin' babies.
A vote for lucas is a vote
For youthful innovation.
Oh, here's his ten point plan.
Kylie, can you help me pass out some more buttons, please?
Then can we work on our lab project?
What's more important, kylie, homework
Or changing the world?
I don't know, zoe.
I've never been much of a leader.
Which is why you have me.
That baby face of yours promises idealism and hope
For all the minors of the town.
And I am going to help you deliver it.
You mean manipulate it.
Tomay-to. tomah-to.
Sheriff carter.
Halo herrera.
Nephrologist, concerned citizen,
And future mayor of eureka.
Well, you don't see that combo platter every day.
Well, I'd like to talk to you about getting your endorsement.
I'm getting coffee. oh, hey, could--
Not your lackey.
Huh. well, um, i-- mr. herrera is it?
I would love to endorse somebody, but--
But he's already promised his endorsement--
To my candidate, right, sheriff?
actually--
Eureka needs a mayor who understands
How a company town works.
Why?
so your boss can have some global dynamics puppet
To sell out the town?
I mean, how many people is thorne gonna fire?
Which is why vincent is the best candidate
Because he's out nurturing the community and--
Guys!
I just want my coffee.
Vincent, get sheriff carter a vinspresso on the house.
It's already on the house and bribery is a crime.
Nice try, fargo.
Do we amuse you, herrera?
Watch and learn, kids.
Folks, would everybody follow me outside?
I have something that will entertain and amaze you.
Okay.
I'm done.
Now can we talk about our project?
I've got some damage control to do here, kylie.
Why don't you just get it started?
But we're supposed to work together.
And we will after you've had a chance to show me
What you've got.
So you're letting me take lead?
That's right. now get to work, partner.
Leave professional politics to the professionals.
Told you it gets competitive.
That's just wrong. uh-huh.
Big news, guys.
Yeah, what's up?
Those ancient security cameras we saw in the bunker,
I pulled the negatives
Before thorne locked the place up again.
It's 35 millimeter.
We just have to find someone old enough to develop it.
What?
The latest next gen technology zane's been developing
For our sponsor.
Overengineered to keep you cool
In the hottest situations.
It's amazing what the greatest scientific minds
And a big old corporate check can buy you.
Too bad we can't buy the next mayoral election.
Just kidding, allison.
I would, however, like you to endorse
Dr. herrera.
Well, won't that be seen as global dynamics taking sides?
Maybe.
But on the other hand,
Having someone to smooth ruffled feathers
During the next round of cutbacks
Isn't a bad idea.
Well, I prefer to make up my own mind.
You should also think about what's best for global.
We need a personal relationship with the town.
One that shows that we're all on the same team.
Are you and I on the same team, eva?
Of course.
I'd like to think we're also friends.
Good.
So why don't you tell me what's in the bunker
Under tesla.
We found bariogenic radiation.
Zoe and her friends are very lucky
That they weren't infected.
That's why I'm ordering a thermal cleaning
Of the entire facility.
You realize you'll destroy any organic material
That's left inside.
Our first obligation is to the town.
Excuse me.
Make sure you vote.
This is allison blake.
I need some records from the archive.
What a time suck this is.
How did we live before digital?
I never knew you had an artistic side, carter.
I'm a man of many facets.
Check out the date stamp. 1939.
I thought eureka wasn't founded till 1950.
Well, it wasn't.
What were they doin' down there?
Well, whatever it was,
They tried to bury it for good. huh.
Look who we have here.
S.a.r.a.h., lights. certainly, sheriff.
That was yesterday?
Thorne's been lookin' for somethin'
Ever since she came to eureka.
How much you wanna bet it's in this room?
What is she up to?
That's gonna have to wait till tomorrow
The debate's about to begin.
You prepare your opening remarks?
What opening remarks?
Hello. hello. is this on?
Hi, everyone. uh, welcome to debate night.
Uh, I'm sheriff carter and I'll be--
Ugh!
cut to the chase!
we want issues, not filler!
Thank you, lexi,
For your wildly inappropriate enthusiasm.
So without further ado,
I give you your candidates.
And if elected, I'll bring the same principles
To the mayor's office as I do to cafe diem.
In short, you want it, I got it!
I promise to bring a voice to the pre-teen prodigy
That the establishment
Too often sees as just another pretty brain.
Times are changing and eureka must change with it.
I will protect the tenets on which this town was founded
And help usher in a new day for eureka.
It's a new day all right.
Just another day in eureka.
Well, it's a mini sun.
Really?
Took you brainiacs all night to come up with that?
No. it took us all night to rule out
Any g.d. experiments as the cause.
So now we have two suns.
Just like tatooine.
Tatu-what?
Geek speak.
The good news is it's stable
Holding its position at about 1,000 feet.
So we're not lighting up the entire state.
Yeah, the last thing we need
Is a spotlight on the town the whole world can see.
Well, agree.
But it's 6:00 a.m. and 90 degrees.
How do we turn it off?
I'm not sure yet.
It has to be some kind of fusion reaction.
Sounds dangerous.
No, not necessarily.
Based on its containment,
I'd--i'd say it's deliberate.
Who'd want to make a second sun on purpose?
Maybe the guy who was trying to make a big bang
At the debates.
Oh, cloud guy. herrera.
Eva wanted me to endorse him.
Such a hidden agenda.
Huh?
what do you mean?
Um, zane found some security photos
Of her sneaking around the facility.
What's down there anyway?
Well, nothing for long.
She ordered a thermal cleaning.
Can--can we stop it till we get inside?
No, she's forbidden access.
The whole place is classified.
Something's goin' on.
You go talk to herrera.
I'll look into it.
Yes, allison blake.
She asked for me?
O--o--okay.
I'm on my way.
Hot enough for you?
yeah.
What's with the umbrellas?
He likes to be prepared?
Did that just come from inside?
That would be yes.
Hey, sheriff.
You change your mind about that endorsement?
Uh, not really. what is this?
This is the end to drought,
Which we may be needing sooner than later.
Welcome to my cloud farm.
Cloud farm?
Yeah, that's-- that's what he said.
I'm taking cloud city to a whole new level
With nanotech hydration.
Cumulus, stratus, cirrus, I can create 'em all.
Oh, like you did with the--with the, uh,
Cloud gag yesterday. nice, huh?
I found a way to hydrogenically infuse the atmosphere
So I can literally sculpt clouds.
The commercial applications are limitless.
Wow. well, I'm--i'm more concerned about your sun stunt.
Sun?
no, no, no.
I'm strictly a cloud guy.
Not that I don't mind the bump in the polling numbers.
People love a spectacle.
Yeah, but you have to admit the timing was suspicious.
Have anyone from global come and review my record.
My life is an open book, sheriff.
I'm beholden to my constituents.
Gotta admit, it's a hell of a show.
Zane. just the man I'm lookin' for.
Save your breath, fargo.
I already know who I'm voting for.
I'm offended.
You think I'm only here to get your vote?
You're not?
no.
I also want a favor.
It is roasting out there.
A candidate has to project cool confidence
Under the most extreme conditions.
I hear through the grapevine you're beta testing something
That can help with staying cool.
Yeah, I might be.
Give me enough to get through the election
And if--when vincent wins,
I'll name a park bench after you.
Tempting, but no.
I don't do politics.
But good luck with that.
Based on these sun scans,
I'd say your competition's definitely heating up.
I was testing the voting machines
And I got dizzy.
I know you're not an ob.
Not really a fan of western medicine.
But I trust you.
Well, I'm flattered.
I'm sure you have much bigger issues to deal with.
Yes, and I have people
To deal with them.
So let's put your mind at ease.
So carter says you've always been interested in politics.
He said I'm obsessed, didn't he?
No.
Jack thinks the system is broken.
But I think it's up to us to make the system work.
Well, this little guy's system is working perfectly.
Here. want to take a look?
It's amazing.
What, is something wrong?
I think I figured out why your hormones
Are so out of whack.
You're getting a double dose.
Lexi, you're having twins. both boys.
Two sons?
Two suns. why didn't I think of that?
Because it's crazy.
It's brilliant.
Lucas, I don't think you appreciate
What's at stake here.
I mean, the mayor's office oversees city hall.
So?
so...
That includes the sheriff's department.
I mean, you could be my dad's boss.
And I thought he hated me now.
It's time to step up our game.
When the world hands you suns, make sunscreen.
Iced mocha, folks.
Stays cool as vincent will be
When he takes the oath of office.
Suits?
it's over 100 degrees out here.
Some candidates can handle the heat
Better than others.
Nice gimmick.
We're just helping the voters
Stay refreshed so they can make
A cogent decision at the polling booth.
Yeah, and we're just trying to protect voters
From harmful uv rays so they won't be blinded
By indecision.
Iced mocha!
get it while it's cold.
Sunscreen, people.
Vote lucas and say no to premature aging.
Zoe, I've had a small issue with our class project.
Bigger priorities at the moment, kylie.
Here, grab a box.
No.
I think this is something
You're really gonna want to see.
This better be good.
Okay, fargo, what's the big emergency?
The corruption of the democratic process.
Everyone knows herrera's in thorne's pocket.
And now she's harassing my candidate. look.
What are you talking about?
It's my wall of fame.
Thorne took it. she redacted all the photos
Of eureka's founders.
She just doesn't want the voters to see
How connected vincent is to this town's history.
Why would she do that?
why?
Herrera checked out.
There's nothing in his background
Having to do with solar energy
Or fusion power.
Great. so we got two suns and no suspect.
And now apparently no air conditioning.
You get anything off herrera?
Other than a creepy politician vibe, no.
No, nothing. what did you find?
Well, I ran some scans.
The sun has all the properties
Of a main sequence dwarf star.
The big question is its energy source.
Well, I might be able to shed some light on that.
I ordered copies of all records
Having to do with the hidden facility under tesla.
Now, of course,
Eva's either had them redacted
Or they don't exist.
But she forgot one thing.
Accounting.
Oh, somebody messed up their lunch receipt.
The d.o.d. keeps track of every penny that they spent.
So I thought I'd see
Where they were spending in 1939.
Check out the stuff
They were ordering.
Deuterium. tritium.
These are heavy hydrogen atoms.
Yeah, and the essential elements
In building fusion bombs.
So thorne dug up an old bomb testing facility?
Allison, we gotta get into that room
Before thorne does her, uh, thermal cleaning thing.
To do what exactly?
To figure out whether something down there
Is causing what's up here.
Hurry up. it's over here.
Kylie, it's a billion degrees out.
I don't have time to play house.
Excuse me.
I'm nine and I'm a junior.
I don't play house.
Then what are we doing here?
Take a look.
Kylie, can you remind me what our assignment was?
Build a working model of the solar system.
Took that a bit literally, did you?
How'd you get all the planets to orbit like that?
They are not the problem.
The sun's a little off.
We are so getting an "a."
One small issue.
I can't make it stop.
So we're not getting an "a"?
Yeah, not so much.
You know what, a controlled fusion reaction like this
Takes real talent.
Well, it wasn't even that hard.
Take a gravitron field generator,
Surround it in a little
Reactor plasma, heat and serve.
Huh. served up kind of a big helping,
Don't you think?
Well, we're a little off on the plasma density.
We?
oh no, no, no.
See, I didn't do this.
Um, and I'm gonna need you to resign from the campaign.
We can't afford the scandal.
Thanks for the support, partner.
Henry, I got a town full of cranky people
Who need some sleep.
You got any ideas?
Yeah, make it do what it's supposed to do.
It should've started to dissipate by now.
Well, it's--it's getting some fuel from somewhere.
Chances are it'll-- it'll burn itself out.
But in the meantime,
I'm gonna go back to my garage
And research just how fast.
Okay. thanks. let me know what you found.
Can I come?
I want to help.
Oh, I think you helped enough already today,
Don't you?
I tell you what, you can take atmospheric readings, okay?
Great.
Great.
So what convinced you?
Oh, eva had all the old photos removed from cafe diem.
Add that to the mass redaction of old g.d. records--
And making jo shut down the eureka museum.
And having me and henry dig up this place.
They're all windows into eureka's past.
Windows thorne seems to want shut.
Let's find out why.
Focus on our constituents.
No swag for seniors.
We're on a budget.
Hey, um, kylie, look,
About earlier.
You mean when you sold me out?
You made a second sun.
You told me to take the lead.
I was being nice.
Like all politicians,
You'll say whatever it takes to get what you want.
Now if you'll excuse me,
I have work to do.
The radiogenic detection field
Reads negative for fusion products.
That good or bad?
It means we're not being radiated.
Rats.
Oh no, that's definitely a good thing, carter.
No, I mean, literally. rats.
- You got somethin' you want to say?
- no.
Okay, come on.
Henry said that the second sun
Was getting fuel from somewhere.
Is it down here?
Well, if it is, I'm not finding it.
I can't believe this place has been under us
All these years.
It's like a door into eureka's past.
Look at this.
That's the door we saw in the security photos.
All right, let's unlock it.
My specialty.
How long do you need?
This long.
These old school locks are no match
For a 20 zettahertz processor.
Okay. this is a bit of a letdown.
Why order a thermal cleaning of an empty room?
Good point. maybe it wasn't always empty.
Can I see, uh, the light scanner thingy?
One biotelemetric dispersion scanner.
Yes. okay. coming up.
This baby reads patterns of movement
Left behind by organic materials.
All right, let's see who's been in here.
Look at that.
The dust layer means that these prints are old.
But these high heels are definitely new.
So are the military boots.
Looks like they were moving stuff out.
Like what?
Like them. oh, my god. are those--
Bodies?
carter, hand me the scanner.
These bodies were removed
In the last 24 hours.
We have to find out who they were
And what they were doing down here.
And why thorne was trying to hide them.
This facility is classified
And scheduled for thermal cleaning.
Yet here you are violating direct orders.
Eva--
I'd except this kind of insubordination
From you, sheriff.
Thank you.
But from you two...
I've always had a bit of trouble
With authority.
As far as I'm concerned,
This just became an active crime scene.
Oh, this is out of your jurisdiction, sheriff.
I'd be happy to have the d.o.d. remind you of that.
And I'd be happy to tell them why.
You tryin' to bluff me?
No, he's not because he's leaving.
We all are.
No, actually. we're not.
Carter, we crossed the line.
Let's not make it any worse.
You sure about this?
Sorry.
Okay.
I can't believe allison backed down.
Yeah, me neither.
Now thorne has all the evidence.
I wouldn't say all the evidence.
I yanked the data chip from the dispersion scanner
Before they took my stuff.
We can see images of everything we scanned.
Nice.
That's definitely not good.
Really?
Based on my initial data,
It should've burned itself out hours ago.
That doesn't look like it's burning out.
It looks like it's getting hotter.
I'm melting.
It's midnight and 110 in the shade.
People are getting pretty testy.
Yeah, me included.
It reminds me of tornado weather.
I have a really bad feeling about this.
Well, um, just keep everybody calm
And preferably indoors.
Roger that.
Kylie is gathering atmospheric data.
I should know something soon.
All right. zane's working on it too.
And in the meantime,
Thorne's wiping out any evidence
That connects her to these bodies.
Any idea who they were?
I'm getting conflicting information.
How so?
From the surveillance photos,
Their approximate age is somewhere between 35 and 45
When they entered the room in 1939.
All right. with you so far.
The organic residue that you scanned
Establishes that they also died in 1939.
So they were buried there for 70 years?
Yeah, well, here's the really puzzling thing.
Common sense says they were around 40 when they died.
But based on these readings,
Their biological age is somewhere around 80.
I want someone posted outside that facility
At all times.
Nobody comes in until after the thermal cleaning.
Let's get the bodies ready for transport.
Transport?
to where?
I'm afraid that's classified information, allison,
As is everything in this room.
And I'd really appreciate it if you leave now.
You said that you considered us to be friends.
I do too.
So why don't you just tell me who those men are?
I know what it looks like from where you stand,
But it's not what you think.
These were good men
Who gave their lives for this town.
And it could've been prevented.
You make it sound as if you knew them.
It's time for you to go now.
Why are you doing this?
Because I have to.
Dr. deacon,
There's something I think
You're really gonna want to see.
Well, please tell me
You didn't make another sun.
No, I've been trying to figure out
How to extinguish the first one.
You mean the second one.
Semantics?
really, sheriff?
Could we just-- what?
Kylie, what did you find?
Well, I've been doing readings all over town
And the upper air is saturated with excess hydrogen.
Is that bad?
Well, uh, not by itself.
But mixed with kylie's project,
Hydrogen could cause a whopping fusion reaction.
Well, how whopping are we talking?
Well, depending on the source and how much is left, big.
Look, I don't know where this hydrogen is coming from
But I promise I didn't do it.
That's okay.
I have a pretty good idea who did.
There's no way my clouds caused this.
Well, it's not the clouds themselves.
It's what's inside of them.
There's a lot--it's a whole lot of hydrogen, right?
Well, not that much.
Maybe 1,000 liters
At standard temperature and pressure.
Well, you've been outside. it's plenty.
How was I supposed to know someone'd be creating
A stellar fusion reaction in their club house?
Hello. you live in eureka.
I guess this means I won't be getting your endorsement.
Well, it's-- just stick to the problem.
Is this how you deliver the nanos to make your clouds?
Yep. a single stage booster that fuels the cold accelerant
Mixer for better saturation and heat dispersion.
Nice.
We gotta fix this. can you reverse it?
You mean exsanguinate the excess hydrogen
From eureka's lower atmosphere?
- Yes. - no.
I mean, I can make any shape you want,
But once the clouds have seeded,
Natural hydration processes take over.
I say we enjoy the extra sunlight while we can.
It'll burn itself out soon enough.
You were saying?
It should've extinguished itself.
But it didn't.
That's because kylie's sun--
Ingenious though it is--
Has evolved from a dwarf star
And is developing into a red super giant.
Uh, which means?
Instead of burning out,
It's blowing up big time.
Not my fault entirely.
And it's not stopping there.
The sun flares are just the beginning.
And we only have a few hours before it goes critical.
Okay,what are our options?
If we can get close enough to launch a dispersion module,
A concentration of iron atoms
Fired directly into the sun's core
Should cause it to implode.
And imploding's a good thing?
Yes. once the sun's incapable of fusion reaction,
Then,uh,we'll all be safe.
What if it doesn't work?
We all get front row seats to a supernova
Way bigger than hiroshima.
And eureka becomes a mile deep crater.
That's too risky. we need to evacuate now.
Y--jo's already started.
But this is also
The most advanced research complex on the planet
And we have an opportunity to save it.
And I'm already developing a compound
To trigger the implosion.
And I'm working on a delivery system.
Towns can be rebuilt. people can't.
Which is why we're evacuating
The people while we're trying to save the town.
We're multitasking.
Sheriff,you might be comfortable risking lives,
But I'm not.
Make sure everybody gets out while there's still time.
Eva,we have a chance to save decades of research.
That wasn't a request.
It's like she wants to see the place
Go up in flames.
I think she might.
Well,what now?
Let's go,people!
Move!
move!
shuttles are waiting outside.
Let's go!
You know,jo,after the election,
We'll have quite the influence around here.
Maybe I can up your pay rate.
Don't make me use the stun gun.
You heard her,fargo. keep moving.
Everybody move.
But we're just making sure his constituents
Are safely away first.
How come you two aren't drenched like the rest of us?
Oh,a worthy candidate is always cool under pressure,sheriff.
And it's classified.
However,I could be convinced
To share my secret for,say,
Your endorsement.
This is mine.
Both of you on the bus.
Go. go!
Everybody move!
keep goin'!
Sounds like we're using sunscreen
To beat injustice.
Just smile and look pretty.
Zo,what are you doin'?
you gotta go.
Guys,please. please.
Not yet.Latest election polls
Only show lucas down by two points.
Lucas,you want to score points with the voters
Or with your girlfriend's old man?
No contest,sir.
That'll work.
Vote lucas!
All right,everybody's cleared out.
Any luck?
We're locked and loaded,sheriff.
Xrt online and ready.
It'll take two people
To get the module in position for launch.
I can do that on my own.
No.
I'll go with you.
I know this baby best.
Okay. all right. you three get to an evacuation site.
- And kylie,nice work.
- Thanks.
Be careful.
Thanks.
Hey,could you keep an eye on,uh,lex and zoe?
Of course. just come back safely.
Thanks.
All right,we're at a safe distance from town.
We can move everyone quickly if we need to,
But with ten evac camps for 2,600 people.
Things are gonna get crowded.
How are you feelin'?
I just wish someone would do something about the heat.
I hear your pain.
This town needs a mayor who can be cool in a crisis.
And if I'm elected,
I promise I won't sleep
Until darkness falls again on eureka.
Oh,please.
You don't need stale campaign promises.
You need ideas that are fresh
As baked bread,which by the way,
Vincent also provides twice daily.
Say no to half-baked science and overbaked bread.
Lucas is your man.
He can't bake his way out of a paper bag.
Oh yeah,like cloud makers...
What is wrong with all of you?
Eureka was founded to protect the greater good.
You're worried about votes.
You should be worried about lives.
You cannot be a leader if there is no town to lead.
So I suggest you get your priorities straight.
That was beautiful.
Having fun yet?
Oh yeah,'cause driving headlong
Into a fiery death is everybody's idea
Of a good time.
Sometimes I think it's his.
Carter,could we have a minute?
Oh,yeah. yeah,yeah. sure.
Jo,you're supposed to be miles away
At an evac camp by now.
I should risk my life more often.
I prefer you didn't.
Come on,josefina,don't go all serious on me now.
It's too late.
Sheriff.
I thought we agreed to evacuate.
We did. so what are you still doing here?
None of your business.
- Don't play games.
- I'm not.
I think zane's device is going to work.
Probably.
If you don't die first.
That is part of the job.
And the men in that bunker would know that.
Sheriff,whatever it is you think you know
About what you found or about me,it's wrong.
Maybe.
But I'm just gettin' started.
If there's one thing I've learned in life
Is that nobody should be left behind,
No matter what the reason.
And that includes you.
Mrs. thorne,I'm duty bound to enforce this evacuation.
Jo,make sure she gets out of town safely.
And no,that's not a request.
That looks pretty bad.
You sure the rocket can handle it?
And untested delivery system
Aimed at an out of control mini sun.
What could go wrong?
Ready?
10,9,8, 7...
It's fried.
Call allison.
Okay,carter,what's wrong?
It's zane's module. the electronics are fried.
Do you have any spares lying around?
Okay,g.d. has plenty
Of short range booster assemblies.
We just need to adapt them
To the xrt's specifications.
We'll never make it back in time.
There is another way.
Dr. Herrera's hydrogen seeding device.
It uses similar boosters to the xrt.
But my greenhouse is too close to that sun.
And there's no way they'll ever survive the heat.
Well,hold on. maybe there is.
What are you thinking?
Well,like fargo said earlier.
A worthy candidate is always cool under pressure
I've been workin'
On this heat protection formula for weeks.
Sure that'll work?
It's a prototype.
But it's overengineered to respond
To increased body heat and adrenaline.
Well,takin' on a supernova
So we should have plenty of both.
All you gotta do is slather it on.
We should have a good 10,maybe 15 minutes
Before we combust.
Fantastic.
We're gettin' awful close.
Then why are you slowing' down?
I'm not.
You smell burning rubber?
We're gonna have to run for it.
Dude,it's like 2 zillion degrees out there.
Okay,I'm game.
You do anything normal for fun?
I play a wicked game of yahtzee.
Put that gel on thick if you know what's good for ya.
You ready?
I feel like a lobster in here.
Temp's climbing. if we stay long,we'll boil.
Find the rocket.
It might help if I could see anything.
Keep looking!
Got it!
got it!
Zane!
zane!
Yep!
right!
Carter?
No. this way.
And...
Set.
Oh damn that's hot!
I know.
I know. we only get one shot at this.
I don't want to miss.
Using gps to target?
I was gonna eyeball it.
Oh,stellar.
Uh,carter,whatever happens,
It's been fun.
No,it hasn't. push the button.
Take a look at that,huh?
That is quite a sunset.
So you managed to pull it off.
You sound disappointed.
Someone cancelled the thermal cleaning.
I wonder who.
You may have the backing of the d.o.d.,
But these people still work for me.
And you work for me.
Not without an explanation.
Those bodies--
Are my concern.
You're asking me to trust you,
But you're giving me nothing.
Well,I'll give you some advice.
History has a way of haunting you
No matter how far you run.
This is part of mine and I'm putting it to rest.
So you stay out of my way.
Listen,um,whoever wins,
It was nice doing battle with you.
After all this,I don't even care who wins anymore. yeah.
As long as one of us buries that guy.
Amen to that.
Hey,partner. thanks for the save.
Fiery death not popular with voters.
I caused it. it's the least I could do.
It was my fault too.
I got so caught up in everything
When I should've been helping you.
I'm sorry. this time I'll make it up to you.
This time?
Well,we have to make a new model.
And someone should make sure I don't destroy the universe.
So...
Partners?
Glad to see you're okay.
Me too.
Look,a--about before--
It's cool,jo. it was a crisis.
You were caught up in the moment.
No,i-i-i wasn't.
You're welcome.
Way to go,sheriff.
So,how's the...
Itchy. mm.
Hope that means it's healing well.
Listen,what,uh,
You and zane did was a brave--
Mythic.
Maybe selfish.
I'm growing attached to the town.
Well,this town,you know,
Is fortunate to have you to protect it.
Well,I'm just doin' my job.
And,um,thorne?
I'm workin' on it.
May I have your attention,please?
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Everyone,can I have your attention,please?
Everyone.
Hello!
Quiet!
Thank you. okay.
All the ballots are in.
It was a very close race.
But after a late night surge at the polling booths,
Our new mayor elect is...
Mr. henry deacon.
- No!
- No.
- Yes!
- Seriously?
Um,no. no,wait. wait.
I wasn't even on the ballot.
I kinda started a write-in campaign.
And,uh,someone gave you their official endorsement.
You're welcome.
I-i-i don't know... what to say.
Say that you'll take the job
Because zoe's boyfriend is the runner up.
Clearly this is a--
A surprise.
I'm not one for making campaign promises.
But,um,I will say this.
What makes eureka special is not the ideal behind it,
But you.
This community.
This family that I'm very proud
To be a part of.
And it's this family
That I promise to protect
No matter what.
Thank you.
See. sometimes the system does work.
What he's trying to tell you is that...
I'm pregnant.
I have a new puzzle for you to solve.
This complex is massive.
- Prewar.
What, late 30's?
- I believe.
It's before Eureka was built.
What's down there?
Ever since you got to this town, you've been looking for something.
Tell me what's going on.
No.
- I have to what?
- Oversee the mayoral election.
This is the official polling place.
It's not a big deal, Carter.
- Well, now why can't Jo do it?
- Because Jo's not your lackey.
Well, the town charter says that voting security falls on the highest ranking law enforcement officer.
That would be you.
Unless you promote me or become otherwise incapacitated.
The Mayor's seat has been open for over a year.
The town needs a voice.
This is a very important service card.
How important can it be?
I mean, my daughter's backing her 17-year-old boyfriend for the job.
Eureka doesn't discriminate.
Some of our smartest citizens are teens.
So instead of working, I have to sit here and count ballots for some doogie Mayor?
No, actually, your sister volunteered for that job.
It's a bad idea.
Lex becomes really obsessed with politics.
And her mood swings are already out of hand.
Actually, she's really into it.
And you should be more sensitive.
- Your sister's pregnant.
- I'm Mr. Sensitive.
Like...
What...
Paper ballots?
Digital voting machines are way too easy to tamper with.
And campaigns get really competitive around here.
Okay.
I'll do it.
I'm...
I'm...
- Thank you.
- Mr. Sensitive though.
Oh, my goodness.
What a beautiful baby.
Love that shirt.
There we go.
More Vinspresso?
Remember, vote Vincent.
Great.
They love you!
I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
I hate politics.
We're the glue that holds this town together, Vincent.
It's time we had a voice.
Smile.
- That's great, thanks.
- All right.
Now back to kissin' babies.
A vote for Lucas is a vote for youthful innovation.
Oh, here's his ten point plan.
Kylie, can you help me pass out some more buttons, please?
Then can we work on our lab project?
What's more important, Kylie, homework or changing the world?
I don't know, Zoe.
- I've never been much of a leader.
- Which is why you have me.
That baby face of yours promises idealism and hope for all the minors of the town.
And I am going to help you deliver it.
- You mean manipulate it.
- Tomay-to.
Tomah-to.
Sheriff Carter.
Halo Herrera.
Nephrologist, concerned citizen, and future mayor of Eureka.
Well, you don't see that combo platter everyday.
I'd like to talk about your endorsement.
I'm getting coffee.
- Could...
- Not your lackey.
Well, I...
Mr. Herrera is it?
I would love to endorse somebody, but...
But he's already promised his endorsement...
- To my candidate, right, Sheriff?
- Actually...
Eureka needs a mayor who understands how a company town works.
Why?
So your boss can have some Global Dynamics puppet to sell out the town?
How many people is Thorne gonna fire?
So Vincent is the best candidate, he's all about nurturing the community.
Guys!
I just want my coffee.
Vincent, get Sheriff Carter a Vinspresso on the house.
It's already on the house and bribery is a crime.
Yeah.
Nice try, Fargo.
Do we amuse you, Herrera?
Watch and learn, kids.
Folks, would everybody follow me outside?
I have something that will entertain and amaze you.
Okay.
I'm done.
Now can we talk about our project?
I've got some damage control to do.
- Why don't you just get it started?
- But we're supposed to work together.
We will after you've shown me what you've got.
- So you're letting me take lead?
- That's right.
Now get to work, partner.
Leave professional politics to the professionals.
- Told you it gets competitive.
- That's just wrong.
- Big news, guys.
- Yeah, what's up?
Those ancient security cameras we saw in the bunker,
I pulled the negatives before Thorne locked the place up again.
It's 35 millimeter.
We just have to find someone old enough to develop it.
What?
The latest next gen technology Zane's been developing for our sponsor.
Overengineered to keep you cool in the hottest situations.
It's amazing what the greatest minds and a big old corporate check can buy.
Too bad we can't buy the next mayoral election.
Just kidding, Allison.
I would, however, like you to endorse Dr. Herrera.
Well, won't that be seen as Global Dynamics taking sides?
Maybe.
But on the other hand, having someone to smooth ruffled feathers during the next round of cutbacks isn't a bad idea.
Well, I prefer to make up my own mind.
You should also think about what's best for Global.
We need a personal relationship with the town.
One that shows that we're all on the same team.
Are you and I on the same team, Eva?
Of course.
I'd like to think we're also friends.
Good.
So why don't you tell me what's in the bunker under Tesla.
We found bariogenic radiation.
Zoe and her friends are very lucky that they weren't infected.
That's why I'm ordering a thermal cleaning of the entire facility.
You realize you'll destroy any organic material that's left inside.
Our first obligation is to the town.
Excuse me.
Make sure you vote.
This is Allison Blake.
I need some records from the archive.
What a time suck this is.
How did we live before digital?
I never knew you had an artistic side, Carter.
I'm a man of many facets.
Check out the date stamp.
1939.
I thought Eureka wasn't founded till 1950.
Well, it wasn't.
What were they doin' down there?
Well, whatever it was, they tried to bury it for good.
Look who we have here.
- Sarah, lights.
- Certainly, Sheriff.
That was yesterday?
Thorne's been lookin' for somethin' ever since she came to Eureka.
How much you wanna bet it's in this room?
So what is she up to?
That's gonna have to wait till tomorrow.
The debate's about to start.
- You prepare your opening remarks?
- What opening remarks?
Hello.
Hello.
Is this on?
Hi, everyone.
Welcome to debate night.
- I'm Sheriff Carter and I'll be...
- Cut to the chase!
We want issues, not filler!
Thank you, Lexi, for your wildly inappropriate enthusiasm.
So without further ado, I give you your candidates.
And if elected, I'll bring the same principles to the mayor's office as I do to Café Diem.
In short, you want it, I got it!
I promise to bring a voice to the pre-teen prodigy that the establishment too often sees as just another pretty brain.
Times are changing and Eureka must change with it.
I will protect the tenets on which this town was founded and help usher in a new day for Eureka.
It's a new day all right.
3.07 :
Here Come the Suns
Just another days in Eureka.
Well, it's a mini sun.
Really?
Took you all night to come up with that?
No.
It took us all night to rule out any GD experiments as the cause.
- So now we have two suns.
- Just like Tatooine.
- Tatu-what?
- Geek speak.
The good news is it's stable holding its position at about 1,000 feet.
We're not lighting the entire state.
The last thing we need is a spotlight on the town the whole world can see.
Well, agree.
But it's 6:00 A.M.
And 90 degrees.
How do we turn it off?
I'm not sure yet.
It has to be some kind of fusion reaction.
- Sounds dangerous.
- No, not necessarily.
Based on its containment, I'd say it's deliberate.
Who'd want to make a second sun on purpose?
Maybe the guy who was trying to make a big bang at the debates.
Oh, cloud guy.
Herrera.
Eva wanted me to endorse him.
- Such a hidden agenda.
- What do you mean?
Zane found some security photos of her sneaking around the facility.
- What's down there anyway?
- Well, nothing for long.
She ordered a thermal cleaning.
Can we stop it till we get inside?
No, she's forbidden access.
The whole place is classified.
Something's goin' on.
You go talk to Herrera.
I'll look into it.
Yes, Allison Blake.
She asked for me?
Okay.
I'm on my way.
- Hot enough for you?
- Yeah.
What's with the umbrellas?
He likes to be prepared?
Did that just come from inside?
That would be yes.
You changed your mind about that endorsement?
Not really.
What is this?
This is the end to drought, which we may be needing sooner than later.
Welcome to my cloud farm.
Cloud farm?
Yeah, that's...
that's what he said.
I'm taking Cloud City to a whole new level with nanotech hydration.
Cumulus, stratus, cirrus, I can create 'em all.
Like you did with the cloud gag yesterday.
Nice, huh?
I found a way to hydrogenically infuse the atmosphere so I can sculpt clouds.
The commercial applications are limitless.
Well, I'm more concerned about your sun stunt.
Sun?
No, no.
I'm a cloud guy.
Not that I don't mind the bump in the polling numbers.
People love a spectacle.
Yeah, but you have to admit the timing was suspicious.
Have anyone from Global come and review my record.
My life is an open book, Sheriff.
I'm beholden to my constituents.
Gotta admit, it's a hell of a show.
Zane.
Just the man I'm lookin' for.
Save your breath, Fargo.
I already know who I'm voting for.
I'm offended.
You think I'm only here to get your vote?
- You're not?
- No.
I also want a favor.
It is roasting out there.
A candidate has to project cool confidence under the most extreme conditions.
I hear you're beta testing something that can help with staying cool.
- Yeah, I might be.
- Give me enough to get through the election and if...
when Vincent wins,
I'll name a park bench after you.
Tempting, but no.
I don't do politics.
But good luck with that.
Based on these sun scans, I'd say your competition's definitely heating up.
I was testing the voting machines and I got dizzy.
I know you're not an OB.
Not really a fan of western medicine.
- But I trust you.
- Well, I'm flattered.
I'm sure you have much bigger issues to deal with.
Yes, and I have people to deal with them.
So let's put your mind at ease.
So Carter says you've always been interested in politics.
He said I'm obsessed, didn't he?
No.
Jack thinks the system is broken.
But I think it's up to us to make the system work.
Well, this little guy's system is working perfectly.
Here.
Want to take a look?
It's amazing.
- What, is something wrong?
- I think I figured out why your hormones are so out of whack.
You're getting a double dose.
Lexi, you're having twins.
Both boys.
Two sons?
Two suns.
Why didn't I think of that?
- Because it's crazy.
- It's brilliant.
Lucas, I don't think you appreciate what's at stake here.
I mean, the mayor's office oversees City hall.
- So?
- So...
That includes the Sheriff's department.
You could be my dad's boss.
- And I thought he hated me now.
- It's time to step up our game.
When the world hands you suns, make sunscreen.
Iced mocha, folks.
Stays cool as Vincent will be when he takes the oath of office.
Suits?
It's over 100 degrees out here.
Some candidates can handle the heat better than others.
Nice gimmick.
We're just helping the voters stay refreshed so they can make a cogent decision at the polling booth.
We're just trying to protect voters from harmful UV rays so they won't be blinded by indecision.
- Iced mocha!
Get it while it's cold.
- Sunscreen, people.
Vote lucas and say no to premature aging.
Zoe, I've had a small issue with our class project.
Bigger priorities at the moment, Kylie.
Here, grab a box.
No.
I think this is something you're really gonna want to see.
This better be good.
Okay, Fargo, what's the big emergency?
The corruption of the democratic process.
Everyone knows Herrera's in Thorne's pocket.
And now she's harassing my candidate.
Look.
- What are you talking about?
- It's my wall of fame.
Thorne took it.
She redacted all the photos of Eureka's founders.
She doesn't want the voters to see how connected Vincent is to this town's history.
- Why would she do that?
- Why?
Herrera checked out.
There's nothing in his background having to do with solar energy or fusion power.
Great.
So we got two suns and no suspect.
And now apparently no air conditioning.
Get anything off Herrera?
Other than a creepy politician vibe, no.
No, nothing.
- What did you find?
- Well, I ran some scans.
The sun has all the properties of a main sequence dwarf star.
The big question is its energy source.
Well, I might be able to shed some light on that.
I ordered copies of all records having to do with the hidden facility under Tesla.
Now, of course, Eva's either had them redacted or they don't exist.
But she forgot one thing.
Accounting.
Oh, somebody messed up their lunch receipt.
The DOD keeps track of every penny that they spent.
So I thought I'd see where they were spending in 1939.
Check out the stuff they were ordering.
Deuterium.
Tritium.
These are heavy hydrogen atoms.
Yeah, and the essential elements in building fusion bombs.
So Thorne dug up an old bomb testing facility?
We gotta get into that room before Thorne does her thermal cleaning thing.
To do what exactly?
To figure out whether something down there is causing what's up here.
Hurry up.
It's over here.
Kylie, it's a billion degrees out.
I don't have time to play house.
Excuse me.
I'm nine and I'm a junior.
I don't play house.
Then what are we doing here?
Take a look.
Kylie, can you remind me what our assignment was?
Build a working model of the solar system.
Took that a bit literally, did you?
How'd you get all the planets to orbit like that?
They are not the problem.
The sun's a little off.
We are so getting an "A".
One small issue.
I can't make it stop.
So we're not getting an "A"?
Yeah, not so much.
You know what, a controlled fusion reaction like this takes real talent.
Well, it wasn't even that hard.
Take a gravitron field generator, surround it in a little reactor plasma, heat and serve.
Served up kind of a big helping, don't you think?
Well, we're a little off on the plasma density.
We?
Oh no, no, no.
See, I didn't do this.
And I'm gonna need you to resign from the campaign.
We can't afford the scandal.
Thanks for the support, partner.
Henry, I got a town full of cranky people who need some sleep.
You got any ideas?
Yeah, make it do what it's supposed to do.
It should've started to dissipate by now.
Well, it's... it's getting some fuel from somewhere.
Chances are it'll burn itself out.
But in the meantime, I'm gonna go back to my garage and research just how fast.
- Thanks.
Let me know what you found.
- Can I come?
I want to help.
I think you helped enough already today, don't you?
I tell you what, you can take atmospheric readings, okay?
Great.
Great.
So what convinced you?
Oh, Eva had all the old photos removed from Café Diem.
Add that to the mass redaction of old GD records...
And making Jo shut down the Eureka museum.
And having me and Henry dig up this place.
They're all windows into Eureka's past.
Windows Thorne seems to want shut.
Let's find out why.
Focus on our constituents.
No swag for seniors.
We're on a budget.
Hey, Kylie, look, about earlier.
- You mean when you sold me out?
- You made a second sun.
- You told me to take the lead.
- I was being nice.
Like all politicians, you'll say whatever it takes to get what you want.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have work to do.
The radiogenic detection field reads negative for fusion products.
That good or bad?
It means we're not being radiated.
Rats.
That's definitely a good thing, Carter.
No, I mean, literally.
Rats.
- You got somethin' you want to say?
- No.
Okay, come on.
Henry said that the second sun was getting fuel from somewhere.
- Is it down here?
- Well, if it is, I'm not finding it.
Can't believe this place has been under us all these years.
It's like a door into Eureka's past.
Look at this.
That's the door we saw in the security photos.
All right,
- let's unlock it.
- My specialty.
So how long do you need?
This long.
These old school locks are no match for a 20 zettahertz processor.
Okay.
This is a bit of a letdown.
Why order a thermal cleaning of an empty room?
Good point.
Maybe it wasn't always empty.
Can I see the light scanner thingy?
One biotelemetric dispersion scanner.
Yes.
Okay.
Coming up.
This baby reads patterns of movement left behind by organic materials.
All right, let's see who's been in here.
Look at that.
The dust layer means that these prints are old.
But these high heels are definitely new.
So are the military boots.
Looks like they were moving stuff out.
Like what?
- Like them.
- Oh, my God.
- Are those...
- Bodies?
Carter, hand me the scanner.
These bodies were removed in the last 24 hours.
We have to find out who they were and what they were doing down here.
And why Thorne was trying to hide them.
This facility is classified and scheduled for thermal cleaning.
Yet here you are violating direct orders.
I'd except this kind of insubordination from you, Sheriff.
- Thank you.
- But from you two...
I've always had a bit of trouble with authority.
As far as I'm concerned, this just became an active crime scene.
Oh, this is out of your jurisdiction, Sheriff.
I'd be happy to have the DOD remind you of that.
And I'd be happy to tell them why.
- You tryin' to bluff me?
- No, he's not, because he's leaving.
- We all are.
- No, actually.
- We're not.
- Carter, we crossed the line.
Let's not make it any worse.
- You sure about this?
- Sorry.
Okay.
- I can't believe Allison backed down.
- Yeah, me neither.
Now Thorne has all the evidence.
I wouldn't say all the evidence.
I yanked the chip from the dispersion scanner before they took my stuff.
We can see images of everything we scanned.
Nice.
That's definitely not good.
Really?
Based on my initial data, it should've burned itself out hours ago.
That doesn't look like it's burning out.
It looks like it's getting hotter.
I'm melting.
It's midnight and 110 in the shade.
- People are getting pretty testy.
- Yeah, me included.
It reminds me of tornado weather.
I have a really bad feeling about this.
Well, just keep everybody calm and preferably indoors.
Roger that.
Kylie is gathering atmospheric data.
I should know something soon.
All right.
Zane's working on it too.
And in the meantime, Thorne's wiping out any evidence that connects her to these bodies.
- Any idea who they were?
- I'm getting conflicting information.
How so?
From the surveillance photos, their approximate age is somewhere between 35 and 45 when they entered the room in 1939.
- All right.
With you so far.
- The organic residue that you scanned establishes that they also died in 1939.
So they were buried there for 70 years?
Yeah, here's the really puzzling thing.
Common sense says they were around 40 when they died.
But based on these readings, their biological age is somewhere around 80.
I want someone posted outside that facility at all times.
Nobody comes in until after the thermal cleaning.
Let's get the bodies ready for transport.
Transport?
To where?
I'm afraid it's classified information, Allison, as is everything in this room.
And I'd really appreciate it if you leave now.
You said that you considered us to be friends.
I do too.
So why don't you just tell me who those men are?
I know what it looks like from where you stand, but it's not what you think.
These were good men who gave their lives for this town.
And it could've been prevented.
You make it sound as if you knew them.
It's time for you to go now.
- Why are you doing this?
- Because I have to.
Dr. Deacon, there's something I think you're really gonna want to see.
Well, please tell me you didn't make another sun.
No, I've been trying to figure out how to extinguish the first one.
- You mean the second one.
- Semantics?
Really, Sheriff?
Could we just...
Kylie, what did you find?
Well, I've been doing readings all over town and the upper air is saturated with excess hydrogen.
- Is that bad?
- Well, not by itself.
But mixed with Kylie's project, hydrogen could cause a whopping fusion reaction.
Well, how whopping are we talking?
Well, depending on the source and how much is left, big.
Look, I don't know where this hydrogen is coming from, but I promise I didn't do it.
That's okay.
I have a pretty good idea who did.
There's no way my clouds caused this.
Well, it's not the clouds themselves.
It's what's inside of them.
- It's a whole lot of hydrogen, right?
- Well, not that much.
Maybe 1,000 liters at standard temperature and pressure.
Well, you've been outside.
It's plenty.
How was I supposed to know someone'd be creating a stellar fusion reaction?
Hello.
You live in Eureka.
I guess this means I won't be getting your endorsement.
Well, it's...
Just stick to the problem.
Is this how you deliver the nanos to make your clouds?
Yep.
A single stage booster that fuels the cold accelerant mixer for better saturation and heat dispersion.
- Nice.
- We gotta fix this.
Can you reverse it?
You mean exsanguinate the excess hydrogen from Eureka's lower atmosphere?
- Yes.
- No.
I mean, I can make any shape you want, but once the clouds have seeded, natural hydration processes take over.
I say we enjoy the extra sunlight while we can.
It'll burn itself out soon enough.
You were saying?
It should've extinguished itself.
But it didn't.
That's because Kylie's sun...
Ingenious though it is... has evolved from a dwarf star and is developing into a red super giant.
- Which means?
- Instead of burning out, it's blowing up big time.
Not my fault entirely.
It's not stopping there.
The sun flares are just the beginning.
And we only have a few hours before it goes critical.
Okay, what are our options?
If we can launch a dispersion module, a concentration of iron atoms fired directly into the sun's core
- should cause it to implode.
- And imploding's a good thing?
Yes.
Once the sun's incapable of fusion reaction, then, we'll all be safe.
What if it doesn't work?
We all get front row seats to a supernova way bigger than Hiroshima.
And Eureka becomes a mile deep crater.
That's too risky.
We need to evacuate now.
Y...
Jo's already started.
But this is also the most advanced research complex on the planet and we have an opportunity to save it.
And I'm already developing a compound to trigger the implosion.
- And I'm working on a delivery system.
- Towns can be rebuilt.
People can't.
Which is why we're evacuating the people while we're trying to save the town.
You might be comfortable risking lives, but I'm not.
Make sure everybody gets out while there's time.
Eva, we have a chance to save decades of research.
That wasn't a request.
It's like she wants to see the place go up in flames.
I think she might.
Well, what now?
Let's go, people!
Move!
Move!
Shuttles are waiting outside.
Let's go!
You know what, after the election, we'll have the influence around.
- Maybe I can up your pay rate.
- Don't make me use the stun gun.
You heard her, Fargo.
Keep moving.
Everybody move.
But we're just making sure his constituents are safely away first.
How come you two aren't drenched like the rest of us?
Oh, a worthy candidate is always cool under pressure, Sheriff.
And it's classified.
However, I could be convinced to share my secret for, say, your endorsement.
This is mine.
Both of you on the bus.
Go.
Go!
Everybody move!
Keep goin'!
Sounds like we're using sunscreen to beat injustice.
- Just smile and look pretty.
- Zo, what are you doin'?
You gotta go.
Guys, please.
Not yet.
Latest election polls only show Lucas down by two points.
You wanna score points with the voters or with your girlfriend's old man?
No contest, sir.
- That'll work.
- Vote Lucas!
All right, everybody's cleared out.
Any luck?
- We're locked and loaded, Sheriff.
- XRT online and ready.
It'll take two people to get the module in position for launch.
I can do that on my own.
No.
I'll go with you.
I know this baby best.
Okay.
All right.
You three get to an evacuation site.
- Nice work.
- Thanks.
- Be careful.
- Thanks.
Could you keep an eye on Lex and Zoe?
Of course.
Just come back safely.
Thanks.
We're at a safe distance from town.
We can move everyone quickly if we need to, but with... ten evac camps for 2,600 people.
Things are gonna get crowded.
How are you feelin'?
I just wish someone would do something about the heat.
I hear your pain.
This town needs a Mayor who can be cool in a crisis.
And if I'm elected, I promise I won't sleep until darkness falls again on Eureka.
Oh, please.
You don't need stale campaign promises.
You need ideas that are fresh as baked bread, which by the way, Vincent also provides twice daily.
Say no to half-baked science and overbaked bread.
- Lucas is your man.
- Can't bake his way out of a paper bag.
- Like cloud makers...
- What is wrong with all of you?
Eureka was founded to protect the greater good.
You're worried about votes.
You should be worried about lives.
You cannot be a leader if there is no town to lead.
So I suggest you get your priorities straight.
That was beautiful.
Having fun yet?
Driving headlong into a fiery death is everybody's idea of a good time.
Sometimes I think it's his.
Carter, could we have a minute?
Sure.
Jo, you're supposed to be miles away at an evac camp by now.
I should risk my life more often.
I prefer you didn't.
Come on, Josefina, don't go all serious on me now.
It's too late.
- I thought we agreed to evacuate.
- We did.
What are you still doing here?
None of your business.
Don't play games.
I'm not.
I think Zane's device is gonna work.
- Probably.
- If you don't die first.
That is part of the job.
And the men in that bunker would know that.
Whatever it is you think you know about what you found or about me, it's wrong.
Maybe.
But I'm just gettin' started.
If there's one thing I learned in life is that nobody should be left behind, no matter what the reason.
And that includes you.
Ms Thorne, I'm duty bound to enforce this evacuation.
Jo, make sure she gets out of town safely.
And no, that's not a request.
That looks pretty bad.
You sure the rocket can handle it?
An untested delivery system aimed at an out of control mini sun.
What could go wrong?
Ready?
It's fried.
I'll call Allison.
Okay, Carter, what's wrong?
Zane's module.
Electronics are fried.
Do you have any spares lying around?
GD has plenty of short range booster assemblies.
We just need to adapt them to the XRT's specifications.
- We'll never make it back in time.
- There is another way.
Dr. Herrera's hydrogen seeding device.
It uses similar boosters to the XRT.
But my greenhouse is too close to that sun.
And there's no way they'll ever survive the heat.
Well, hold on.
Maybe there is.
- What are you thinking?
- Well, like Fargo said earlier.
We just need to stay cool under pressure.
I've been workin' on this heat protection formula for weeks.
- Sure that'll work?
- It's a prototype.
But it's overengineered to respond to increased body heat and adrenaline.
Takin' on a supernova so we should have plenty of both.
All you gotta do is slather it on.
We should have a good 10, maybe 15 minutes before we combust.
Fantastic.
That's gettin' worst.
- Then why are you slowing' down?
- I'm not.
You smell burning rubber?
Gonna have to run for it.
Dude, it's like 2 zillion degrees out there.
- Okay, I'm game.
- You do anything normal for fun?
I play a wicked game of yahtzee.
Put that gel on thick if you know what's good for ya.
You ready?
I feel like a lobster in here.
Temp's climbing.
If we stay long, we'll boil.
Find that rocket.
- It might help if I could see anything.
- Keep looking!
Got it!
Got it!
Yep!
Right!
This way.
And... set.
We only get one shot at this.
I don't wanna miss.
Using GPS to target?
- I was gonna eyeball it.
- Oh, stellar.
Whatever happens, it's been fun.
No, it hasn't.
Push the button.
Take a look at that.
That is quite a sunset.
So you managed to pull it off.
You sound disappointed.
Someone cancelled the thermal cleaning.
I wonder who.
You may have the backing of the DOD, but these people still work for me.
- And you work for me.
- Not without an explanation.
- Those bodies...
- Are my concern.
You're asking me to trust you, but you're giving me nothing.
Well, I'll give you some advice.
History has a way of haunting you no matter how far you run.
This is mine and I'm putting it to rest.
So you stay out of my way.
Listen, whoever wins, it was nice doing battle with you.
After all this, I don't even care who wins anymore.
- As long as one of us buries that guy.
- Amen to that.
Hey, partner.
Thanks for the save.
Fiery death not popular with voters.
I caused it.
It's the least I could do.
My fault too.
I got so caught up in everything when I should've been helping you.
- This time I'll make it up to you.
- This time?
Well, we have to make a new model.
And someone should make sure I don't destroy the universe.
So...
Partners?
- Glad to see you're okay.
- Me too.
- Look, about before...
- It's cool, Jo.
It was a crisis.
You were caught up in the moment.
No, I wasn't.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Way to go, Sheriff.
So how's the...
Itchy.
Hope that means it's healing well.
Listen, what... you and Zane did was a brave... mythic.
Maybe selfish.
- I'm growing attached to the town.
- This town, is fortunate to have you to protect it.
- I'm just doin' my job.
- And...
Thorne?
I'm workin' on it.
May I have your attention, please?
'scuse me.
Everyone, can I have your attention, please?
Everyone.
Quiet!
Thank you.
All the ballots are in.
It was a very close race.
But after a late night surge at the polling booths, our new mayor elect is...
Mr. Henry Deacon.
Seriously?
No, wait.
I wasn't even on the ballot.
I kinda started a write-in campaign.
And someone gave you their official endorsement.
You're welcome.
I don't know...
- What to say.
- Say that you'll take the job because Zoe's boyfriend is the runner up.
Clearly this is a surprise.
I'm not one for making campaign promises.
But I will say this.
What makes Eureka special is not the ideal behind it,
but you.
This community.
This family that I'm very proud to be a part of.
And it's this family that I promise to protect no matter what.
Thank you.
See.
Sometimes the system does work.
Previously on Eureka
What Sheriff Subtle's trying to tell you is that...
I'm pregnant.
I have a new puzzle for you to solve.
This complex is massive.
- Prewar.
What, late 30's?
- I believe.
It's before Eureka was built.
What's down there?
Ever since you got to this town, you've been looking for something.
Tell me what's going on.
No.
- I have to what?
- Oversee the mayoral election.
This is the official polling place.
It's not a big deal, Carter.
- Well, now why can't Jo do it?
- Because Jo's not your lackey.
Well, the town charter says that voting security falls on the highest ranking law enforcement officer.
That would be you.
Unless you promote me or become otherwise incapacitated.
The Mayor's seat has been open for over a year.
The town needs a voice.
This is a very important service card.
How important can it be?
I mean, my daughter's backing her 17-year-old boyfriend for the job.
Eureka doesn't discriminate.
Some of our smartest citizens are teens.
So instead of working, I have to sit here and count ballots for some doogie Mayor?
No, actually, your sister volunteered for that job.
It's a bad idea.
Lex becomes really obsessed with politics.
And her mood swings are already out of hand.
Actually, she's really into it.
And you should be more sensitive.
- Your sister's pregnant.
- I'm Mr. Sensitive.
Like...
What...
Paper ballots?
Digital voting machines are way too easy to tamper with.
And campaigns get really competitive around here.
Okay.
I'll do it.
I'm...
I'm...
- Thank you.
- Mr. Sensitive though.
Oh, my goodness.
What a beautiful baby.
Love that shirt.
There we go.
More Vinspresso?
Remember, vote Vincent.
Great.
They love you!
I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
I hate politics.
We're the glue that holds this town together, Vincent.
It's time we had a voice.
Smile.
- That's great, thanks.
- All right.
Now back to kissin' babies.
A vote for Lucas is a vote for youthful innovation.
Oh, here's his ten point plan.
Kylie, can you help me pass out some more buttons, please?
Then can we work on our lab project?
What's more important, Kylie, homework or changing the world?
I don't know, Zoe.
- I've never been much of a leader.
- Which is why you have me.
That baby face of yours promises idealism and hope for all the minors of the town.
And I am going to help you deliver it.
- You mean manipulate it.
- Tomay-to.
Tomah-to.
Sheriff Carter.
Halo Herrera.
Nephrologist, concerned citizen, and future mayor of Eureka.
Well, you don't see that combo platter everyday.
I'd like to talk about your endorsement.
I'm getting coffee.
- Could...
- Not your lackey.
Well, I...
Mr. Herrera is it?
I would love to endorse somebody, but...
But he's already promised his endorsement...
- To my candidate, right, Sheriff?
- Actually...
Eureka needs a mayor who understands how a company town works.
Why?
So your boss can have some Global Dynamics puppet to sell out the town?
How many people is Thorne gonna fire?
So Vincent is the best candidate, he's all about nurturing the community.
Guys!
I just want my coffee.
Vincent, get Sheriff Carter a Vinspresso on the house.
It's already on the house and bribery is a crime.
Yeah.
Nice try, Fargo.
Do we amuse you, Herrera?
Watch and learn, kids.
Folks, would everybody follow me outside?
I have something that will entertain and amaze you.
Okay.
I'm done.
Now can we talk about our project?
I've got some damage control to do.
- Why don't you just get it started?
- But we're supposed to work together.
We will after you've shown me what you've got.
- So you're letting me take lead?
- That's right.
Now get to work, partner.
Leave professional politics to the professionals.
- Told you it gets competitive.
- That's just wrong.
- Big news, guys.
- Yeah, what's up?
Those ancient security cameras we saw in the bunker,
I pulled the negatives before Thorne locked the place up again.
It's 35 millimeter.
We just have to find someone old enough to develop it.
What?
The latest next gen technology Zane's been developing for our sponsor.
Overengineered to keep you cool in the hottest situations.
It's amazing what the greatest minds and a big old corporate check can buy.
Too bad we can't buy the next mayoral election.
Just kidding, Allison.
I would, however, like you to endorse Dr. Herrera.
Well, won't that be seen as Global Dynamics taking sides?
Maybe.
But on the other hand, having someone to smooth ruffled feathers during the next round of cutbacks isn't a bad idea.
Well, I prefer to make up my own mind.
You should also think about what's best for Global.
We need a personal relationship with the town.
One that shows that we're all on the same team.
Are you and I on the same team, Eva?
Of course.
I'd like to think we're also friends.
Good.
So why don't you tell me what's in the bunker under Tesla.
We found bariogenic radiation.
Zoe and her friends are very lucky that they weren't infected.
That's why I'm ordering a thermal cleaning of the entire facility.
You realize you'll destroy any organic material that's left inside.
Our first obligation is to the town.
Excuse me.
Make sure you vote.
This is Allison Blake.
I need some records from the archive.
What a time suck this is.
How did we live before digital?
I never knew you had an artistic side, Carter.
I'm a man of many facets.
Check out the date stamp.
1939.
I thought Eureka wasn't founded till 1950.
Well, it wasn't.
What were they doin' down there?
Well, whatever it was, they tried to bury it for good.
Look who we have here.
- SARAH, lights.
- Certainly, Sheriff.
That was yesterday?
Thorne's been lookin' for somethin' ever since she came to Eureka.
How much you wanna bet it's in this room?
So what is she up to?
That's gonna have to wait till tomorrow.
The debate's about to start.
- You prepare your opening remarks?
- What opening remarks?
Hello.
Hello.
Is this on?
Hi, everyone.
Welcome to debate night.
- I'm Sheriff Carter and I'll be...
- Cut to the chase!
We want issues, not filler!
Thank you, Lexi, for your wildly inappropriate enthusiasm.
So without further ado, I give you your candidates.
And if elected, I'll bring the same principles to the mayor's office as I do to Café Diem.
In short, you want it, I got it!
I promise to bring a voice to the pre-teen prodigy that the establishment too often sees as just another pretty brain.
Times are changing and Eureka must change with it.
I will protect the tenets on which this town was founded and help usher in a new day for Eureka.
It's a new day all right.
Season 3 Episode 7 Here Come the Suns (v 1.00)
Team Projet-SG.
Just another days in Eureka.
Well, it's a mini sun.
Really?
Took you all night to come up with that?
No.
It took us all night to rule out any GD experiments as the cause.
- So now we have two suns.
- Just like Tatooine.
- Tatu-what?
- Geek speak.
The good news is it's stable holding its position at about 1,000 feet.
We're not lighting the entire state.
The last thing we need is a spotlight on the town the whole world can see.
Well, agree.
But it's 6:00 AM.
And 90 degrees.
How do we turn it off?
I'm not sure yet.
It has to be some kind of fusion reaction.
- Sounds dangerous.
- No, not necessarily.
Based on its containment, I'd say it's deliberate.
Who'd want to make a second sun on purpose?
Maybe the guy who was trying to make a big bang at the debates.
Oh, cloud guy.
Herrera.
Eva wanted me to endorse him.
- Such a hidden agenda.
- What do you mean?
Zane found some security photos of her sneaking around the facility.
- What's down there anyway?
- Well, nothing for long.
She ordered a thermal cleaning.
Can we stop it till we get inside?
No, she's forbidden access.
The whole place is classified.
Something's goin' on.
You go talk to Herrera.
I'll look into it.
Yes, Allison Blake.
She asked for me?
Okay.
I'm on my way.
- Hot enough for you?
- Yeah.
What's with the umbrellas?
He likes to be prepared?
Did that just come from inside?
That would be yes.
You changed your mind about that endorsement?
Not really.
What is this?
This is the end to drought, which we may be needing sooner than later.
Welcome to my cloud farm.
Cloud farm?
Yeah, that's...
That's what he said.
I'm taking Cloud City to a whole new level with nanotech hydration.
Cumulus, stratus, cirrus, I can create 'em all.
Like you did with the cloud gag yesterday.
Nice, huh?
I found a way to hydrogenically infuse the atmosphere so I can sculpt clouds.
The commercial applications are limitless.
Well, I'm more concerned about your sun stunt.
Sun?
No, no.
I'm a cloud guy.
Not that I don't mind the bump in the polling numbers.
People love a spectacle.
Yeah, but you have to admit the timing was suspicious.
Have anyone from Global come and review my record.
My life is an open book, Sheriff.
I'm beholden to my constituents.
Gotta admit, it's a hell of a show.
Zane.
Just the man I'm lookin' for.
Save your breath, Fargo.
I already know who I'm voting for.
I'm offended.
You think I'm only here to get your vote?
- You're not?
- No.
I also want a favor.
It is roasting out there.
A candidate has to project cool confidence under the most extreme conditions.
I hear you're beta testing something that can help with staying cool.
- Yeah, I might be.
- Give me enough to get through the election and if...
when Vincent wins,
I'll name a park bench after you.
Tempting, but no.
I don't do politics.
But good luck with that.
Based on these sun scans, I'd say your competition's definitely heating up.
I was testing the voting machines and I got dizzy.
I know you're not an OB.
Not really a fan of western medicine.
- But I trust you.
- Well, I'm flattered.
I'm sure you have much bigger issues to deal with.
Yes, and I have people to deal with them.
So let's put your mind at ease.
So Carter says you've always been interested in politics.
He said I'm obsessed, didn't he?
No.
Jack thinks the system is broken.
But I think it's up to us to make the system work.
Well, this little guy's system is working perfectly.
Here.
Want to take a look?
It's amazing.
- What, is something wrong?
- I think I figured out why your hormones are so out of whack.
You're getting a double dose.
Lexi, you're having twins.
Both boys.
Two sons?
Two suns.
Why didn't I think of that?
- Because it's crazy.
- It's brilliant.
Lucas, I don't think you appreciate what's at stake here.
I mean, the mayor's office oversees City hall.
- So?
- So...
That includes the Sheriff's department.
You could be my dad's boss.
- And I thought he hated me now.
- It's time to step up our game.
When the world hands you suns, make sunscreen.
Iced mocha, folks.
Stays cool as Vincent will be when he takes the oath of office.
Suits?
It's over 100 degrees out here.
Some candidates can handle the heat better than others.
Nice gimmick.
We're just helping the voters stay refreshed so they can make a cogent decision at the polling booth.
We're just trying to protect voters from harmful UV rays so they won't be blinded by indecision.
- Iced mocha!
Get it while it's cold.
- Sunscreen, people.
Vote lucas and say no to premature aging.
Zoe, I've had a small issue with our class project.
Bigger priorities at the moment, Kylie.
Here, grab a box.
No.
I think this is something you're really gonna want to see.
This better be good.
Okay, Fargo, what's the big emergency?
The corruption of the democratic process.
Everyone knows Herrera's in Thorne's pocket.
And now she's harassing my candidate.
Look.
- What are you talking about?
- It's my wall of fame.
Thorne took it.
She redacted all the photos of Eureka's founders.
She doesn't want the voters to see how connected Vincent is to this town's history.
- Why would she do that?
- Why?
Herrera checked out.
There's nothing in his background having to do with solar energy or fusion power.
Great.
So we got two suns and no suspect.
And now apparently no air conditioning.
Get anything off Herrera?
Other than a creepy politician vibe, no.
No, nothing.
- What did you find?
- Well, I ran some scans.
The sun has all the properties of a main sequence dwarf star.
The big question is its energy source.
Well, I might be able to shed some light on that.
I ordered copies of all records having to do with the hidden facility under Tesla.
Now, of course, Eva's either had them redacted or they don't exist.
But she forgot one thing.
Accounting.
Oh, somebody messed up their lunch receipt.
The DOD keeps track of every penny that they spent.
So I thought I'd see where they were spending in 1939.
Check out the stuff they were ordering.
Deuterium.
Tritium.
These are heavy hydrogen atoms.
Yeah, and the essential elements in building fusion bombs.
So Thorne dug up an old bomb testing facility?
We gotta get into that room before Thorne does her thermal cleaning thing.
To do what exactly?
To figure out whether something down there is causing what's up here.
Hurry up.
It's over here.
Kylie, it's a billion degrees out.
I don't have time to play house.
Excuse me.
I'm nine and I'm a junior.
I don't play house.
Then what are we doing here?
Take a look.
Kylie, can you remind me what our assignment was?
Build a working model of the solar system.
Took that a bit literally, did you?
How'd you get all the planets to orbit like that?
They are not the problem.
The sun's a little off.
We are so getting an "A".
One small issue.
I can't make it stop.
So we're not getting an "A"?
Yeah, not so much.
You know what, a controlled fusion reaction like this takes real talent.
Well, it wasn't even that hard.
Take a gravitron field generator, surround it in a little reactor plasma, heat and serve.
Served up kind of a big helping, don't you think?
Well, we're a little off on the plasma density.
We?
Oh no, no, no.
See, I didn't do this.
And I'm gonna need you to resign from the campaign.
We can't afford the scandal.
Thanks for the support, partner.
Henry, I got a town full of cranky people who need some sleep.
You got any ideas?
Yeah, make it do what it's supposed to do.
It should've started to dissipate by now.
Well, it's...
It's getting some fuel from somewhere.
Chances are it'll burn itself out.
But in the meantime, I'm gonna go back to my garage and research just how fast.
- Thanks.
Let me know what you found.
- Can I come?
I want to help.
I think you helped enough already today, don't you?
I tell you what, you can take atmospheric readings, okay?
Great.
Great.
So what convinced you?
Oh, Eva had all the old photos removed from Café Diem.
Add that to the mass redaction of old GD records...
And making Jo shut down the Eureka museum.
And having me and Henry dig up this place.
They're all windows into Eureka's past.
Windows Thorne seems to want shut.
Let's find out why.
Focus on our constituents.
No swag for seniors.
We're on a budget.
Hey, Kylie, look, about earlier.
- You mean when you sold me out?
- You made a second sun.
- You told me to take the lead.
- I was being nice.
Like all politicians, you'll say whatever it takes to get what you want.
Now if you'll excuse me, I have work to do.
The radiogenic detection field reads negative for fusion products.
That good or bad?
It means we're not being radiated.
Rats.
That's definitely a good thing, Carter.
No, I mean, literally.
Rats.
- You got somethin' you want to say?
- No.
Okay, come on.
Henry said that the second sun was getting fuel from somewhere.
- Is it down here?
- Well, if it is, I'm not finding it.
Can't believe this place has been under us all these years.
It's like a door into Eureka's past.
Look at this.
That's the door we saw in the security photos.
All right,
- let's unlock it.
- My specialty.
So how long do you need?
This long.
These old school locks are no match for a 20 zettahertz processor.
Okay.
This is a bit of a letdown.
Why order a thermal cleaning of an empty room?
Good point.
Maybe it wasn't always empty.
Can I see the light scanner thingy?
One biotelemetric dispersion scanner.
Yes.
Okay.
Coming up.
This baby reads patterns of movement left behind by organic materials.
All right, let's see who's been in here.
Look at that.
The dust layer means that these prints are old.
But these high heels are definitely new.
So are the military boots.
Looks like they were moving stuff out.
Like what?
- Like them.
- Oh, my God.
- Are those...
- Bodies?
Carter, hand me the scanner.
These bodies were removed in the last 24 hours.
We have to find out who they were and what they were doing down here.
And why Thorne was trying to hide them.
This facility is classified and scheduled for thermal cleaning.
Yet here you are violating direct orders.
I'd except this kind of insubordination from you, Sheriff.
- Thank you.
- But from you two...
I've always had a bit of trouble with authority.
As far as I'm concerned, this just became an active crime scene.
Oh, this is out of your jurisdiction, Sheriff.
I'd be happy to have the DOD remind you of that.
And I'd be happy to tell them why.
- You tryin' to bluff me?
- No, he's not, because he's leaving.
- We all are.
- No, actually.
- We're not.
- Carter, we crossed the line.
Let's not make it any worse.
- You sure about this?
- Sorry.
Okay.
- I can't believe Allison backed down.
- Yeah, me neither.
Now Thorne has all the evidence.
I wouldn't say all the evidence.
I yanked the chip from the dispersion scanner before they took my stuff.
We can see images of everything we scanned.
Nice.
That's definitely not good.
Really?
Based on my initial data, it should've burned itself out hours ago.
That doesn't look like it's burning out.
It looks like it's getting hotter.
I'm melting.
It's midnight and 110 in the shade.
- People are getting pretty testy.
- Yeah, me included.
It reminds me of tornado weather.
I have a really bad feeling about this.
Well, just keep everybody calm and preferably indoors.
Roger that.
Kylie is gathering atmospheric data.
I should know something soon.
All right.
Zane's working on it too.
And in the meantime, Thorne's wiping out any evidence that connects her to these bodies.
- Any idea who they were?
- I'm getting conflicting information.
How so?
From the surveillance photos, their approximate age is somewhere between 35 and 45 when they entered the room in 1939.
- All right.
With you so far.
- The organic residue that you scanned establishes that they also died in 1939.
So they were buried there for 70 years?
Yeah, here's the really puzzling thing.
Common sense says they were around 40 when they died.
But based on these readings, their biological age is somewhere around 80.
I want someone posted outside that facility at all times.
Nobody comes in until after the thermal cleaning.
Let's get the bodies ready for transport.
Transport?
To where?
I'm afraid it's classified information, Allison, as is everything in this room.
And I'd really appreciate it if you leave now.
You said that you considered us to be friends.
I do too.
So why don't you just tell me who those men are?
I know what it looks like from where you stand, but it's not what you think.
These were good men who gave their lives for this town.
And it could've been prevented.
You make it sound as if you knew them.
It's time for you to go now.
- Why are you doing this?
- Because I have to.
Dr. Deacon, there's something I think you're really gonna want to see.
Well, please tell me you didn't make another sun.
No, I've been trying to figure out how to extinguish the first one.
- You mean the second one.
- Semantics?
Really, Sheriff?
Could we just...
Kylie, what did you find?
Well, I've been doing readings all over town and the upper air is saturated with excess hydrogen.
- Is that bad?
- Well, not by itself.
But mixed with Kylie's project, hydrogen could cause a whopping fusion reaction.
Well, how whopping are we talking?
Well, depending on the source and how much is left, big.
Look, I don't know where this hydrogen is coming from, but I promise I didn't do it.
That's okay.
I have a pretty good idea who did.
There's no way my clouds caused this.
Well, it's not the clouds themselves.
It's what's inside of them.
- It's a whole lot of hydrogen, right?
- Well, not that much.
Maybe 1,000 liters at standard temperature and pressure.
Well, you've been outside.
It's plenty.
How was I supposed to know someone'd be creating a stellar fusion reaction?
Hello.
You live in Eureka.
I guess this means I won't be getting your endorsement.
Well, it's...
Just stick to the problem.
Is this how you deliver the nanos to make your clouds?
Yep.
A single stage booster that fuels the cold accelerant mixer for better saturation and heat dispersion.
- Nice.
- We gotta fix this.
Can you reverse it?
You mean exsanguinate the excess hydrogen from Eureka's lower atmosphere?
- Yes.
- No.
I mean, I can make any shape you want, but once the clouds have seeded, natural hydration processes take over.
I say we enjoy the extra sunlight while we can.
It'll burn itself out soon enough.
You were saying?
It should've extinguished itself.
But it didn't.
That's because Kylie's sun...
Ingenious though it is... has evolved from a dwarf star and is developing into a red super giant.
- Which means?
- Instead of burning out, it's blowing up big time.
Not my fault entirely.
It's not stopping there.
The sun flares are just the beginning.
And we only have a few hours before it goes critical.
Okay, what are our options?
If we can launch a dispersion module, a concentration of iron atoms fired directly into the sun's core
- should cause it to implode.
- And imploding's a good thing?
Yes.
Once the sun's incapable of fusion reaction, then, we'll all be safe.
What if it doesn't work?
We all get front row seats to a supernova way bigger than Hiroshima.
And Eureka becomes a mile deep crater.
That's too risky.
We need to evacuate now.
Y...
Jo's already started.
But this is also the most advanced research complex on the planet and we have an opportunity to save it.
And I'm already developing a compound to trigger the implosion.
- And I'm working on a delivery system.
- Towns can be rebuilt.
People can't.
Which is why we're evacuating the people while we're trying to save the town.
You might be comfortable risking lives, but I'm not.
Make sure everybody gets out while there's time.
Eva, we have a chance to save decades of research.
That wasn't a request.
It's like she wants to see the place go up in flames.
I think she might.
Well, what now?
Let's go, people!
Move!
Move!
Shuttles are waiting outside.
Let's go!
You know what, after the election, we'll have the influence around.
- Maybe I can up your pay rate.
- Don't make me use the stun gun.
You heard her, Fargo.
Keep moving.
Everybody move.
But we're just making sure his constituents are safely away first.
How come you two aren't drenched like the rest of us?
Oh, a worthy candidate is always cool under pressure, Sheriff.
And it's classified.
However, I could be convinced to share my secret for, say, your endorsement.
This is mine.
Both of you on the bus.
Go.
Go!
Everybody move!
Keep goin'!
Sounds like we're using sunscreen to beat injustice.
- Just smile and look pretty.
- Zo, what are you doin'?
You gotta go.
Guys, please.
Not yet.
Latest election polls only show Lucas down by two points.
You wanna score points with the voters or with your girlfriend's old man?
No contest, sir.
- That'll work.
- Vote Lucas!
All right, everybody's cleared out.
Any luck?
- We're locked and loaded, Sheriff.
- XRT online and ready.
It'll take two people to get the module in position for launch.
I can do that.
- I can do that on my own.
- No.
I'll go with you.
No.
I'll go with you.
I know this baby best.
Okay.
All right.
You three get to an evacuation site.
- Nice work.
- Thanks.
- Be careful.
- Thanks.
Could you keep an eye on Lex and Zoe?
Of course.
Just come back safely.
Thanks.
We're at a safe distance from town.
We can move everyone quickly if we need to, but with... ten evac camps for 2,600 people.
Things are gonna get crowded.
How are you feelin'?
I just wish someone would do something about the heat.
I hear your pain.
This town needs a Mayor who can be cool in a crisis.
And if I'm elected, I promise I won't sleep until darkness falls again on Eureka.
Oh, please.
You don't need stale campaign promises.
You need ideas that are fresh as baked bread, which by the way, Vincent also provides twice daily.
Say no to half-baked science and overbaked bread.
- Lucas is your man.
- Can't bake his way out of a paper bag.
- Like cloud makers...
- What is wrong with all of you?
Eureka was founded to protect the greater good.
You're worried about votes.
You should be worried about lives.
You cannot be a leader if there is no town to lead.
So I suggest you get your priorities straight.
That was beautiful.
Having fun yet?
Driving headlong into a fiery death is everybody's idea of a good time.
Sometimes I think it's his.
Carter, could we have a minute?
Sure.
Jo, you're supposed to be miles away at an evac camp by now.
I should risk my life more often.
I prefer you didn't.
Come on, Josefina, don't go all serious on me now.
It's too late.
- I thought we agreed to evacuate.
- We did.
What are you still doing here?
None of your business.
Don't play games.
I'm not.
I think Zane's device is gonna work.
- Probably.
- If you don't die first.
That is part of the job.
And the men in that bunker would know that.
Whatever it is you think you know about what you found or about me, it's wrong.
Maybe.
But I'm just gettin' started.
If there's one thing I learned in life is that nobody should be left behind, no matter what the reason.
And that includes you.
I'm duty bound to enforce this evacuation.
Jo, make sure she gets out of town safely.
And no, that's not a request.
That looks pretty bad.
You sure the rocket can handle it?
An untested delivery system aimed at an out of control mini sun.
What could go wrong?
Ready?
It's fried.
I'll call Allison.
Okay, Carter, what's wrong?
Zane's module.
Electronics are fried.
Do you have any spares lying around?
GD has plenty of short range booster assemblies.
We just need to adapt them to the XRT's specifications.
- We'll never make it back in time.
- There is another way.
Dr. Herrera's hydrogen seeding device.
It uses similar boosters to the XRT.
But my greenhouse is too close to that sun.
And there's no way they'll ever survive the heat.
Well, hold on.
Maybe there is.
- What are you thinking?
- Well, like Fargo said earlier.
We just need to stay cool under pressure.
I've been workin' on this heat protection formula for weeks.
- Sure that'll work?
- It's a prototype.
But it's overengineered to respond to increased body heat and adrenaline.
Takin' on a supernova so we should have plenty of both.
All you gotta do is slather it on.
We should have a good 10, maybe 15 minutes before we combust.
Fantastic.
That's gettin' worst.
- Then why are you slowing' down?
- I'm not.
You smell burning rubber?
Gonna have to run for it.
Dude, it's like 2 zillion degrees out there.
- Okay, I'm game.
- You do anything normal for fun?
I play a wicked game of yahtzee.
Put that gel on thick if you know what's good for ya.
You ready?
I feel like a lobster in here.
Temp's climbing.
If we stay long, we'll boil.
Find that rocket.
- It might help if I could see anything.
- Keep looking!
Got it!
Got it!
Yep!
Right!
This way.
And... set.
We only get one shot at this.
I don't wanna miss.
Using GPS to target?
- I was gonna eyeball it.
- Oh, stellar.
Whatever happens, it's been fun.
No, it hasn't.
Push the button.
Take a look at that.
That is quite a sunset.
So you managed to pull it off.
You sound disappointed.
Someone cancelled the thermal cleaning.
I wonder who.
You may have the backing of the DOD, but these people still work for me.
- And you work for me.
- Not without an explanation.
- Those bodies...
- Are my concern.
You're asking me to trust you, but you're giving me nothing.
Well, I'll give you some advice.
History has a way of haunting you no matter how far you run.
This is mine and I'm putting it to rest.
So you stay out of my way.
Listen, whoever wins, it was nice doing battle with you.
After all this, I don't even care who wins anymore.
- As long as one of us buries that guy.
- Amen to that.
Hey, partner.
Thanks for the save.
Fiery death not popular with voters.
I caused it.
It's the least I could do.
My fault too.
I got so caught up in everything when I should've been helping you.
- This time I'll make it up to you.
- This time?
Well, we have to make a new model.
And someone should make sure I don't destroy the universe.
So...
Partners?
- Glad to see you're okay.
- Me too.
- Look, about before...
- It's cool, Jo.
It was a crisis.
You were caught up in the moment.
No, I wasn't.
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.
Way to go, Sheriff.
So how's the...
Itchy.
Hope that means it's healing well.
Listen, what... you and Zane did was a brave... mythic.
Maybe selfish.
- I'm growing attached to the town.
- This town, is fortunate to have you to protect it.
- I'm just doin' my job.
- And...
Thorne?
I'm workin' on it.
May I have your attention, please?
'scuse me.
Everyone, can I have your attention, please?
Everyone.
Quiet!
Thank you.
All the ballots are in.
It was a very close race.
But after a late night surge at the polling booths, our new mayor elect is...
Mr. Henry Deacon.
Seriously?
No, wait.
I wasn't even on the ballot.
I kinda started a write-in campaign.
And someone gave you their official endorsement.
You're welcome.
I don't know...
- What to say.
- Say that you'll take the job because Zoe's boyfriend is the runner up.
Clearly this is a surprise.
I'm not one for making campaign promises.
But I will say this.
What makes Eureka special is not the ideal behind it,
but you.
This community.
This family that I'm very proud to be a part of.
And it's this family that I promise to protect no matter what.
Thank you.
See.

What do you want for your birthday?
Which animal has the most babies?
Certainiy a rabbit.
Can i have one?
We'ii see.
Carefui, don't trip up.
Hurry up, we're late.
italian shoes... are made of Uruguayan leather.
We're proud of this.
it's an honour for Uruguayans.
What a surprise to see shoes... made of our leather in italian shop windows.
But we should be making them, as it's our leather.
Dariing!
Come and show our friends your shoes.
We bought a pair to show you.
-Who's that?
- My wife.
i've only shaved one leg.
Nobody's going to look at your legs.
Not even me.
- Let's go.
- i want to see Daddy!
Daddy didn't tell us everything when he invited us.
i want to give him a kiss!
We've famous writers like Onetti.
We could easily have shoe designers!
is designing a shoe so diffcult?
Come on, chicks, hurry up!
italian shoes from Uruguayan leather.
For your birthday.
Has Daddy arrived?
Not yet, it's election time.
Give them to me, for the cake.
No!
Dariing... it's a very important day.
Daddy is going to lose the election... and he'ii come and live with us.
We'ii be able to travel.
Where to?
To Paris!
When?
Soon.
Long live the Coiorado Party!
Long live the Party!
Where are they coming from?
The ballot-boxes are arriving from the most distant areas.
People are impatient.
This is a historical moment.
Winston, a coffee please.
Here's your coffee, Sir.
I want another one for afterwards.
Where are my cigarettes?
You asked me to hide them.
Give me one.
Senator, I've some results.
Give me them.
Salto, 100.000 Canelones, 60.000 The Blanco Party is in the lead.
And Trinidad, 2.000
And to think I went there.
I know... I spoke about wool, leather there.
I ate a lamb there!
They really are idiots!
- These are only the first ratings.
- Go on.
Aurora, stop making that row on your piano!
Come here!
There are too many people in this house.
Don't run, you're getting in everyone's way.
Can't anyone tell me who's going to win the elections?
Daddy...
Daddy...
Please, we need the final results.
We couldn't care less about the ratings.
We're working on them.
The results are coming in.
- Susana, I trust you.
- Daddy!
- What?
- Someone's broken my tennis cup.
Your what?
My tennis cup's broken.
So what, who cares, Santiago!
I do...
You play tennis?
- Yes.
- Hey, my face.
Off with you, Santiago!
Good evening Madame... d'you know the encyclopaedia "Treasure for the Young"?
No.
D'you know why we don't sneeze when we're asleep?
"The book of every Why'..
is the volume answering this question and many others.
Sorry, I'm very busy.
But just listen.
for example... why aren't fish salty when we eat them?
- Do you play ludo?
- Benito!
Go home quickly, fructuoso.
There you are, at last!
Have you been paid?
I'm working!
Give me the money.
I can't buy anything any more.
Later on, Dolores.
And the marvellous tales?
Where shall I put all the "Treasures for the Young"dumped in the bedroom?
I don't know, any old where...
"Any old where" is already full up.
What are all these posters?
There've been bigger ones on the façade for three weeks.
And as a present you get "The miracle of human life"!
There is already a mess with my brother's blinking campaign.
But at least he has a good salary and a proper job.
Don't do that, Santiago!
Dolores, see to your children.
I can't stand them any more.
So you're here, my son?
I'm so happy!
At San Pedro del Timote, I visited mud huts.
Shirley!
We can build them with our own hands.
for all of you. I've got the plans.
felucho, how late you are!
Godmother, you're right:
God was in a bad mood when he created this country.
The people are already in the streets.
Mummy, where are chicks which were going to be born.
In the flames of the candles, pet.
Concentrate and you'll see them.
Can I blow them out?
No, let's wait till Daddy's lost the election and joins us.
After counting 70% of the votes, it's possible to predict... a big victory for General Gestido in this presidential election.
We're waiting for Senator Saavedra, certainly... the future minister for public health.
Mummy!
Daddy has won the election again!
...a great day for the Colorado Party.
It's a triumph here.
People are flocking to celebrate the Colorado Party's victory.
I can never thank my wife enough, I hope nothing or nobody will separate me from her, for her presence at diffcult moments during the campaign, and for her sensitivity in face of all the problems.
Mummy, he won't be coming.
Can we start the cake?
She has always been a good counsellor... and has known how to instil in me the force I needed... to get here.
It's certain that without her I should never have been able...
The chicks, the chicks...
Mummy, come out!
The candles are going to go out.
Chicks...
Mummy, come out!
Mummy, let me in!
Mummy, open up!
Mummy!
Mummy!
Yes, speaking.
But who's on the line?
What?
Which police station are you calling from?
But, damn it, what's wrong?
D'you know what I'm doing here?
I'm founding a new country!
What?
What's that?
When?
And my little girl?
How is she?
I'll come at once.
Inspector, nobody must know.
Nobody.
Senator...
Senator...
She was a nurse.
Can we proceed?
Are we going to Paris?
How pretty she is!
How old are you?
- Seven.
- What's your name?
Masángeles...
Masángeles Saavedra.
- What did you say?
- Masángeles Saavedra.
What's wrong, Daddy?
Take a seat, Madam.
I'll look after everything.
Who are they?
Shall we go home?
We are at home, darling.
Padre félix, please close the window.
I'm cold.
Aurelio...
Have you anything to say?
No...
The most important things have been said.
If I've understood correctly...
Well then!
If it's the will of Our Lord Jesus Christ, what a motherfucker!
- So be it.
-Amen.
In spite of everything, she's one of us, isn't she?
You don't think so?
- ls there any yogurt?
- Here you are.
- '"Masángeles' you said?
- Yes.
I think it'd be best... for you to live at your Aunt Dolores's.
And why me?
And we've no more room opposite!
- l don't know who it is.
- Dolores!
- She's just told us her name.
- Shut up!
At my aunt's?
Unfortunately, darling, you have an aunt, 6 cousins who are devilish... and a brother...
Santiago.
Dolores, come and help me.
- Hi.
- Hi.
1 , 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9, 10.
Are you ok?
Yes.
Well, no, not really.
Do you want to lie down?
What's that?
My creepy crawlies.
Haven't you ever seen any?
What do they eat?
flies, ants, mantis.
They can devour a man in a few seconds.
Do you want to hold one?
D'you have a tame one?
No, I need them to be wild.
What are they doing there?
They're waiting.
- Would you like one?
- Do they have babies?
What did your Mummy die of?
She died of...
Well, she wanted to go to Paris.
Clot!
Get out of here!
Out of my sight!
I hate you!
No!
I must get on and cook.
Ok then.
Panetti, you must start here.
Ok, but it will take time.
What are you doing here?
I'm chatting.
Can't you see they've lots to do?
I don't want any children here.
And these shoes?
Italian shoes made of Uruguayan leather.
Like yours.
But now, you've shaved both legs.
But damn it, who's decided to break my balls?
15 minutes and I haven't smoked one!
It's 3 o'clock in the morning.
Why aren't you in bed?
I am in bed.
But you're not asleep.
I can't sleep.
How's that?
Everybody manages to.
Not me.
Stroke my nose.
Slower.
Are you alright here, darling?
Why am I living with Aunt Dolores and not with you?
It's very complicated.
One day, you'll understand.
I can understand now.
Aurora and I have a family, we have our own lives, and if changes disrupted it, it would create tension.
You smell of alcohol, Daddy.
Because of my work.
I've been had again by that son of a bitch, Menotti.
Who's Menotti?
A son of a bitch I should kill.
You'd better clean your teeth.
Yes.
And divorce, change jobs, go abroad, change my life...
Maybe tomorrow.
Turn off the lights upstairs.
There's always one left on.
I'm the one who pays all the bills here.
So I can turn on all the lights I want.
All!
Aurora!
What's happening to the doors?
Why are you doing this to me?
I'm having the whole house renovated.
-And that wardrobe there?
- lt's not there any more.
And my socks?
My shirts, my pants?
I don't know.
Ask Winston.
Winston?
Did I tell you that General Romagno had called?
To say Dr Menotti had taken up the duel.
It'll be a duel with pistols, early tomorrow, at 8 a.m.
With the same arms as for the duel which cost Mr BeltrÁin his life.
And the same rules.
At 8 a.m.
That's a good time.
It's not too early.
You fixed the time.
Oh, did I?
It's a good time.
Do you need anything else?
Solitude.
The best of company.
- Oh, Winston...
- Yes, Sir?
You should have phoned me sooner.
I did.
You weren't at Madam Susana's any more, and hadn't yet arrived at Madam Estela's.
I thought you were at Madam Sofia's, but nobody answered.
It's because I forgot to tell you about Nuria, a magnificent Negress.
- Shall I turn on the radio?
- Yes, thank you.
...without ever having learnt to fence, Senator Saavedra will fight his 4 th duel.
Don Aurelio, if you're listening in, I beg you to be careful.
We've always followed you, since your 1 st duel.
What would become of us without you?
We've always followed you, since your 1 st duel.
What would become of us without you?
Panetti, where've you been?
I've been waiting for hours!
D'you see this room, Panetti?
I'm very fond of it.
And I'd like the top part, up there, to be arched.
D'you see?
That's a bit complicated, we could see about that later.
Aurelio!
Who's in there?
Aurelio, is it you?
Give me a hand, Panetti!
- Santiago, what are you doing?
- l'm doing bigs.
With your pants on?
Nobody's perfect.
What a son of a bitch Menotti is!
He's killed him.
He's covered in blood!
Help him.
He's bleeding.
He's bleeding.
There.
On the right.
No, on the left.
No, it'll be better upstairs, in the bedroom.
No, we haven't time.
In the dining-room, on the table.
Quiet, please.
Talk to me, Aurelio.
Please bring me some surgical spirit and some tweezers.
And call the priest.
To hell with the priest!
I want to finish the duel.
father, have you come to give the Minister the extreme unction?
The Deputy Minister, it seems he's been hit by a bullet.
Can you confirm that?
No.
The Minister's in perfect health.
I'll be careful.
Don't move.
You'll see, it won't be long.
Gently...
Does it hurt?
Yes.
Keep still.
There. lt's over.
- Panetti.
- Yes?
I've always wanted a door here.
Here?
Are you sure?
It's a question of intimacy.
Give me the cartridge!
The cartridge!
Much ado about nothing, as usual.
If it was serious, we'd know.
You shouldn't walk round here.
It's very dangerous.
What's that for?
The wind carries the prayers to God.
What's the prayer on this one?
It's too complicated for a woman.
These are Buddhist flags.
But you go to father felix's church.
So as to conspire!
Careful, it's very precious.
Winston, look what I've bought.
Where's Mother?
Madam is in her room with Mr. Aurelio.
There were wonderful things at the Hotel Carrasco's auction.
- fine glassware, everything.
- What's that?
We can put it in the scullery.
But you're mad!
This piece merits... a better place.
- Excuse me, your Excellency.
- Yes.
I'm coming.
What is it, Benito?
- Have you any children?
- Yes.
Do you know "The Miracle of Human Life""?
It explains procreation.
Benito, stop all this with your books.
We're at a turning point.
Talk to Aurelio.
He'll find you a job.
Oh, we haven't anybody at the head of the UTE.
- The telephone?
- Yes.
I don't know anything about it.
I can't imagine talking into a wire.
That doesn't matter, I don't know anything about electricity and I'm the Minister for Energy.
Those who work there are the ones who know.
As for us, we manage.
We must master the modus operandi.
Create new ones, imagine the modus operandi for the future.
Get it?
Stop that, or I'll kill you.
Hasn't he woken up yet?
Aurelio!
Wake up.
It's a wonderful day.
Your speech about wool was a sensation.
They all came.
You were on the front page of the papers.
But I lost the duel.
What a son of a bitch Menotti is!
That's not important.
You've won the hearts of all the voters.
At the next election you'll stand for the presidency, won't you?
- Not even drunk.
- What d'you mean?
It's a life of servitude.
The president is the first to get up, the last to go to bed.
- Vice-president, then.
- What's the use of being Vice-president?
Like that, you'll only be at a gun-shot from the presidency.
Stop your crap.
Look who's asleep at your feet.
How are things, Larrea?
At 4 p.m, the girls must be fetched from school.
Then they go to a birthday party.
At 5 p.m, fructuoso has to be fetched from his chess lesson.
Are you going to the UTE like that?
You look like a tramp.
Button up your jacket.
Turn round.
And take off your hat.
Go on.
No, put it on again.
You're going to be late for work.
On your way back, get some buns!
- But have you put in the door or not?
- Yes, Madam.
I like the other door better.
That one?
You can change it tomorrow.
And what shall we do with this one?
Don't stress me.
I can't think of all the doors.
I had to pay for this door.
We'll talk about that, later.
I can't put my finger on what worries me here.
It's this pillar.
How come I didn't notice before?
It's the best thing about this house.
It's a horror, Panetti.
It's true, when you look at it, it is a bit ugly.
Shall we knock it down?
- You're not an engineer?
- Yes.
Well, all but.
But if one takes into account the contrary forces, gravity, then...
But according to you, can we demolish it or not?
I don't dare do it, Madam.
Was I wrong in taking you on?
It's not that.
We'll demolish it, but...
But nobody wants to work in this country.
We don't have unemployed, but lazy louts.
And I warn you:
we're going to renovate this house, and make it larger, too.
Good night, darling.
Everything ok?
More or less.
Why did you marry Aurora?
She's perfect.
No, Daddy, she's not perfect.
Well, ok.
She's not perfect.
You've got masses of women round you.
Why her?
What's that, "masses of women"?
Who told you that?
Did you love Mummy?
She was an exceptional woman.
You'd promised to take her to Paris.
Did you love her or didn't you?
And you?
Did you love her?
I don't remember.
What d'you mean?
I remember her perfume, her hair, her necklace.
But her face has faded.
She was glorious.
Almost as much as you are.
Who are these people?
father felix!
Who are these goddamned long-haired yobs?
These young people work for the church.
They carry on the work undertaken years ago by a man...
A man who... every day, went and looked after the sick, every day, went and looked after the sick, the most destitute.
I mean Don Anibal Saavedra.
30 years after his too early passing away...
Esteban, tell us...
How many houses have we built at Paso Carrasco?
Three.
Our problem is the lack of help.
Yes, there are already 157 young girls pregnant, living in great deprivation.
In the name of the father of this project, Anibal Saavedra, we suggest that everybody voice their opinion now... about this distressing reality.
But tell me, felucho, is this a mass for my deceased husband or an AGM?
is this a mass for my deceased husband or an AGM?
Benito!
Benito!
How do you manage to play so well?
I play that one too.
Yes, I know.
But not as well as you.
It comes with practice.
No.
No, your talent is not due to that.
It's your spirit.
No, it's not that.
Don't say that!
You're glorious!
I have neither body nor soul.
I must be a ghost!
Are you mad, or what?
Damn it, who taught you to play that?
My Mummy.
Can you play anything else?
This, for instance.
Well I'm damned, by the Holy Virgin!
Pinch me, I'm dreaming!
Well I'm damned, by the Holy Virgin!
Pinch me, I'm dreaming!
- Your mother taught you that?
- Yes, she had long fine fingers.
A direct access to my room.
That'd be perfect here.
- Or rather there, Panetti?
- No.
- Or rather there, Panetti?
- No.
The balcony railing is far too near.
What are you reading?
That's not for girls of your age!
I don't see why.
It's a french book.
Aurora, leave that child alone.
Mrs. Aurora, I must pay them.
I've got no money.
I've got no money.
It's pay day.
If I don't pay them, they'll kill me.
I'll have problems with the union.
But we haven't any more money.
Stop it. I'm the poor one here.
The work must go on...
We must make the most of the good weather, the winter will be very cold.
And why don't you make the most of the good weather to go to the racecourse, lay bets and with luck you'll be able to pay us.
lay bets and with luck you'll be able to pay us.
You know God's watching us all the time!
There you are... trying to lead me astray, but God's watching us!
The workman behind me is watching us and he's ready to kill me if I don't pay him.
The Council of Ministers has decreed the honours of a Head of State...
The Council of Ministers has decreed the honours of a Head of State... for the burial of our dear President of the Republic.
for the burial of our dear President of the Republic.
I wonder what the army thinks.
They want us to decree a state of emergency.
The Left and the Communists are rising.
And there are tupamaros everywhere!
I don't like the look of things.
- l don't know what will happen.
- That's the point, Aurelio.
It's an opportunity for you to save our country.
We need a strong leader.
Stop, Mummy.
Daddy, what's a state of emergency?
It means the army can come into people's homes at any time, under the pretext of national security, even here.
Panetti resigned. lf we don't pay him he's going to stop the renovation.
Panetti resigned. lf we don't pay him he's going to stop the renovation.
The President of the Republic is dead!
So what?
I've no money.
I'm a civil servant, not a multinational.
The Uruguayan State is poor.
Haven't you finished your renovation yet?
You don't understand what's important in life.
That's just the problem with this country.
That's good.
Be a bit more energetic, fructuoso.
-Are you sure it's over there?
- Yes, Madam.
But that's not Montevideo.
But that's not Montevideo.
Yes it is.
Panetti!
Panetti!
Mrs. Aurora!
What a surprise!
Come in, come in!
Give that to me, I'll help you.
Come in!
What a surprise your visit is.
- May I introduce my wife?
- Good morning.
- May I introduce my wife?
- Good morning.
Would you like a matecito?
No, thank you.
- l've brought you something.
- Don't tell me it's what I was wating for.
What is it?
A mixer.
Madam, we have no electricity.
You've no electricity?
Installing it is far too expensive for us.
Come here.
Come here.
Come.
This is for you.
Do you like it?
- Yes, it's beautiful.
-And as it's cold in winter.
You're barefoot!
She hasn't any more shoes and we haven't the money to buy any.
Start working for me again.
When you like, but have you settled the money problem?
What's that?
What, Madam?
That.
Nothing.
It's only a Communist Party flyer.
The militants who came have good ideas.
They're lads from here.
They're decent people.
They're lads from here.
They're decent people.
But are you going to vote communist, Panetti?
Yes, and my wife too.
They think a lot about the workers.
But don't you understand anything?
I do my best.
You know what it'll be like if they get into power?
D'you know what communism is?
Under a communist regime you can't own anything.
Nothing.
They take everything.
They take...
They take everything you've got, Panetti.
You'll even have to share your wife.
And loyalty, Panetti?
What about that?
Wait.
Winston, the number of the dossier again.

The government must act.
You don't know what poverty they live in.
There's a minister who deals with that.
There's a minister who deals with that.
It's not enough.
As for me, I'm going to act: they can live here.
Madam, we're not in an orphanage.
It's not the same thing, cooking for 10 as it is for 20.
Ok.
You have to decide.
Either we pay Panetti, or I'll go and get them to live here.
Are you there, Aurora?
We've just received the news.
We've just received the news.
As regards the robbery committed at the State Pawnbroker's by the guerillas, the National Liberation Movement of the tupamaros declares... that it will give the workers back the booty taken away in error.
The communication runs:
"We don't want to rob the workers, but rather those who exploit and rob the workers.'"
but rather those who exploit and rob the workers.'"
They won't give it back!
If they say they're going to give it back they'll do it.
They only want rich people's jewellery.
There's a man to whom they've returned his dead parents' wedding rings.
I'd not give anything back, I'd keep the lot.
They'll start killing people.
They'll start killing people.
They're nothing less than criminals.
No.
They want to save the world like Robin Hood.
I'm not afraid of them.
They won't attack the family of the future president.
Give your sister a share, Ignacio.
They can't come in here.
Of course they can...
Of course they can... they can come in through this door, now.
Do as you're told, and everything will be alright.
The same for you, too, little girl.
Please put down your guns.
Search the house!
There are 8 children here.
There are 8 children here.
Put your guns down, please.
Ok.
We'll put our guns down.
They were in the kitchen.
Let them go, Miguel.
Quiet, please.
Nobody else in the house?
-Answer!
- Put your gun down!
Well?
Panetti has finished work and my husband is at the TVcentre.
Do you take us for tupamaros?
No, we're the ones who are the tupamaros.
from the National Liberation Movement?
Yes.
You've heard about us?
Of course!
Aurelio is on TV.
As new minister of industry and Commerce,
As new minister of industry and Commerce, I'm considering the creation of a tax on financial activities.
financial activity must be... at the service of national industry.
Because industry creates employment.
And it's with jobs that we can combat injustice.
We must put an end to it...
- Good intentions.
- You see.
- Good intentions.
- You see.
But he'll not manage to get his ideas voted in.
The only solution is a mobilisation of the masses, a revolution.
You must understand: there's no democracy without sharing.
No sharing, no democracy.
But does he think he'll manage it by democratic means?
- ls there another way?
- We only believe in armed struggle.
- ls there another way?
- We only believe in armed struggle.
Me too.
Santiago!
- What's the matter with him?
- Leave quickly.
He's going to die.
Good.
Get going, quick!
Paint in the stars.
Hurry up!
Paint in the stars.
Hurry up!
Come on, hurry up!
Come on.
Get a move on!
- Paint in the stars!
- Shall I paint a star on the wall?
Can't you see that this wall has just been repainted?
See for yourself!
Not on this door. lt's new.
Where do you want us to paint it, then?
Where do you want us to paint it, then?
I've an idea!

May He have mercy on you.
May He have mercy on you.
May God help you repent of your sins.
May He bring you peace and relieve you of your illness.
The body of Christ.
Amen.
That's it, félix.
Thank you. I'm very tired.
I need to be left alone.
Bye, Mother.
Bye, Son.
No!
Don't go!
- Shall I tap up your cushion, Gran?
- Yes.
Help me a little.
So much is happening in this house.
There're some weird people here you know.
Keep away from them.
Terrible things are happening in this country.
Don't stay with those fools.
Get away from here as soon as you can.
Go anywhere.
To Paris...
We don't have a lot of time left.
Go to the altar.
And look under the pale blue altar cloth, on the right.
You'll find something.
Have you got it?
- Your real grandfather's letters.
- What?
Keep them carefully.
It's a secret.
Aurelio isn't Anibal's son.
But you must still love him because he's a good man.
Anibal was a fool.
They smell nice.
- What use are they?
They're in french.
- Keep them.
In this madhouse, only you can be trusted with them.
That's all I have left.
Do you have anything to tell me?
Come on... I think I'm ill.
Strange things are happening to me.
They're all ill in this house.
Except you, darling.
Don't worry.
It's natural.
It'll pester you a little, but only for 40 years.
That's it, you're a woman.
I've lived long enough to see you become a woman.
Charity, mercy and compassion.
Those are God's commandments.
Don't talk to me of charity.
I know we're fighting the same battle.
Yes, it's true.
Poverty, problems, diffculties.
A lot of people have been arrested.
That's always been the case, Santiago.
At night, I hear the police vans.
And the shouts.
They are all tortured, some disappear.
Whole families... await news from them for months...
Sometimes in vain.
I can only offer them spiritual and emotional help.
The peace only God can bring.
- You hear the police vans, too.
- What do you know about it?
I have my sources.
Do you think I ignore your struggle?
What if you were trying to trap me?
You've known me for 1 9 years.
Why have you come?
What do you want?
Your phone line.
I loved my mother so much!
Do you want to sit down?
What a pain this menopause is!
But at least, I won't have any more kids.
At last.
Does it hurt?
It always hurts.
Everything hurts.
I don't know what men see in it.
They breathe, they pant, they scream...
They sweat, they stink...
Let me give you a piece of advice:
Don't resist.
Don't even try. lt makes it worse.
The quicker we give in, the sooner it's over.
CX4N to CX7J, I can hardly hear you.
What's the matter?
The aerial is 56 metres above sea levell
CX7J to CX4N.
Conditions are bad!
Over!
CX4N to CX7J.
The sailing boats are ready.
Over.
CX7J to CX4N.
Cancel it all.
The weather forecast is bad.
Over.
CX4N to CX7J.
What do you mean, bad weather?
What is it?
Radio Tirana.
Where's that?
In Albania.
And there's also Radio Cairo.
- ls it here?
- Yes, it's here.
Why communicate with the whole world?
To make contact.
If I stop talking, it means something's happened to me.
- Shall I show you?
- Yes.
Well, for instance, Equatorial Guinea.
Wait...
CQ Guinea 3C16, here is Uruguay CX7J.
Over.
What's that?
How should I know?
Remove it.
Isn't the phone simpler?
No, you can't rely on it.
And on top of that, this is the future.
A global means of communication.
In 2008, every household will have one next to the fridge.
They look like ants.
Exactly.
They are born together, they live together, they die together.
They work for nothing.
Benito!
This country is too small for you.
No!
No!
Out of respect for God, tell...
Dolores and the kids it's over.
She is your wife, and I christened your 6 children!
Yes, 3 wonderful children, and 3 others...
All this is a mistake!
I'm not sure... I'll think about it.
Come back tomorrow.
I can't.
- On Wednesday.
- lt's Winston's day off.
- So what?
- father, open your eyes!
- Winston...
- Yes, and?
Haven't you got it yet?
What sort of world do you live in?
Benito...
You have said it yourself from this pulpit:
I can admit anything, as long as it's human.
Yes.
It was on a bad day.
It's your duty to tell them.
But who'll believe such a thing?
You're convincing.
Nobody can resist you.
Show some guts for once, and phone them!
I need a phone line.
All right.
And 197 metres wiring.
1 97 metres wiring?
Why?
It's a big church.
One must walk a lot.
But God listens everywhere.
Yes.
But I'm not God.
Enough!
It's a disaster, Mr. Aurelio!
And yet, I feel much more confident.
If you carry on like this, you'll be ready for this duel... in 5 years time!
Unfortunately, it's in 5 days.
Santiago, how do I look?
Pathetic.
Everything you do seems ridiculous to me.
You must understand:
it's a question of honour.
- lt's a man's business.
- Women's business, more like it!
What's this one called?
Mimi?
- fifi?
- Bijou?
Santiago, don't listen to the gossips.
You talk of honour?
When your whole party is corrupt!
What?
Will you also talk to me of a revolution?
It can't be worse than now.
Even Che told me that it was useless in this country.
You want a revolution?
You'll have one!
followed by a military regime!
And one which will last.
They are the worst because they are all frustrated!
All they do is prune the trees!
You only talk of power.
You couldn't care less about the people's problems.
The people don't want chaos, they want trustworthy leaders.
Look, this is what's important!
Houses for those who have none.
This is concrete!
You just send money to the Yankees.
What did they mean, your speeches about productivity, wool, Italian shoes?
- Demagogue!
- Don't talk to me about wool!
You've never set eyes on a sheep, you little brat!
Shall I pour you a drink?
for example, why is he serving us?
He's got education.
Are you educated or not?
I've seen the books you read.
You know the history of france, Graeco-Roman history,
World War ll, Nazism.
Yes, I'm fascinated by the history of the Third Reich.
He's better educated than you, and you've made him a miserable servant!
No, I'm a butler.
No.
You're a servant and you like it.
And it's fine as it is.
Can't a servant know Graeco-Roman history?
You're a coward, that's your problem.
You've no balls.
I do. I face the music, I fight duels, and I rule every goddamn day!
You and your pals from the government, you live in the past.
If you don't tackle today's challenges, you'll disappear.
It's inscribed.
But you don't get it.
Who do you think you are?
A clairvoyant?
You've never done an hour's work!
You can't even tie your shoe laces.
Throw this asshole out of here!
- Come on, do it if you dare!
- Stop it!
You, too.
What will you do now?
Tell me... fight a duel with him?
Winston...
You're not a servant.
Nor a butler.
This house is still standing thanks to you.
Thank you, Miss Masángeles.
I feel like blowing my brains out.
Why?
Can't you see?
I'm crying. I'm pathetic.
No.
You are what you are.
You don't lie.
You don't pretend.
You follow your heart.
- But I am pathetic.
- You're my brother.
Why don't you kiss me?
You can't kiss.
How could you know?
And you?
Aren't you scared?
Scared of what?
Of being naked.
You are scared.
But it's natural.
We shouldn't be here.
Why?
We should be in another world where there are no rules.
Have you been with a man before?
Have you been with a woman before?
Why are you here?
D'you want me to go?
You're going to regret this.
Maybe.
Does it hurt?
No, stay.
Gently.
Santiago...
Santiago...
Santiago!
Shit!
Yes.
Hello?
Hello?
What's that?
I can hardly hear you.
He says you must put a tourniquet on him.
-Above or below?
-Above.
But he's losing a lot of blood.
I can't give you the address.
We haven't studied it yet, professor.
Thanks.
What a nightmare!
I was more scared than they were!
I couldn't remember if I'd loaded my gun.
It'll take an hour with the pneumatic drill.
Come on, we'll dig the tunnel.
Let's do it!
What about you, are you ok?
Do you call this a tourniquet, asshole?
Tell Santiago to take him to figueroa's.
Where is he, by the way?
Santiago!
What the hell are you doing?
I'm simulating.
Raúl's dying.
Take him to figueroa's.
We've got to dig the tunnel.
Hurry up!
Go and turn around.
Son of a bitch!
Scum!
You didn't tell me my husband was a queer!
This is the house of God.
I lose both my husband and my servant!
The motherfuckers have taken my silver egg.
- Where the hell are they?
- l can't tell you anything.
What's stopping you?
The secret of confession.
Bullshit!
What if someone wants to drop... an atomic bomb?
Do you have to keep it secret?
Who's the fool who invented that?
The rules of the church don't allow me to talk to you.
I'll never set foot in this damned...
brothel again!
You're a fool, félix!
A queer, a shitty Negro!
Come on, hurry up!
The two groups will join up in the basement...
I believe the basement is not locked
Santiago!
If he's there we'll have to operate right away.
Hello?
When I call the Stella Maris church, why do I always land any old where?
This is not any old where, you have reached the church.
Who's speaking?
- father Pino.
- father Pino?
But... shouldn't you be dead?
I resurrected.
The people needed me.
I'm father Pino ll.
How can I help you?
My prayers don't seem to be heard.
- On the contrary. I hear them every night.
- Pino?
Hello?
- father Pino, we have to pack!
- Hello?
father Miguel, I can't hear you.
It's a trapl
Hello?
- What?
- They got Miguel.
Damn it!
We're in the shit!
Hurry!
Somebody help him!
for Christ's sake!
- l've something to tell you.
- l haven't got time.
If anything happens to me, leave.
You haven't seen anything.
Everything will be ok.
If things turn bad, go to the french embassy.
You will go, ok?
Everything will be all right.
- Don't worry.
- Hurry.
Who is she?
Nobody.
Nobody?
Who the hell is she?
I can't tell you!
She's my contact.
A.k.a Gloria.
I won't tell you any more.
Ok, come on, hurry!
faster!
It's time.
Let me just smoke one.
One more minute for Roletti to live.
God is with you!
Daddy!
What is it?
Shall I come with you?
Should I take this as an apology?
Your name won't be tainted, Aurelio.
Your honour will be safe.
You speak as if you were drawing up my will!
Monsieur Aurelio, after much thought, forget whatI havetaughtyou .
follow your instinct.
Stop.
Id's, please.
You can go, Minister.
Only the Minister and his witnesses.
- He's my son.
- The duel is a private matter.
Sorry, I didn't know.
Don't worry, I'll wait for you outside.
Give this Roletti a proper thrashing!
It's only his 1st duel.
As regards our argument the other day... I went too far.
Me too.
Please forgive me.
I was a bit...
-All this unrest makes me nervous.
- Yes.
Minister, it's time to go.
We'll talk about it later.
Go now.
Wait for me.
Please.
Get into position.
We'll fight until we're dead beaten.
The first to put both feet beyond the limits loses the duel.
Salute.
On guard.
Ready?
Start now.
Halt!
Doctor!
I want to kill him.
That's enough.
You can't continue.
- l want to see blood!
- There's quite enough as it is!
Goddam it, I'm not sure he'll make it, this time.
End of the fight.
Good morning.
Thank you for coming.
- You said your name was...?
- Rodriguez.
I'm the youngest.
Of course!
You're you from Cerro Chato?
No, from fray Mocho.
I must have known your father.
Of course you knew him!
- He was a great friend of your father's.
- Estela mustn't meet Susana.
But Estela is coming at 1 1:15.
She's always early.
A challenge to passing time.
Ok, Daddy.
Yes, my father talked about it.
Thanks for coming.
- That's normal.
- Let's go, shall we?
Yes.
Good bye.
Get well quickly.
Be brave, won't you?
Thanks.
Long live the Colorado Party, goddam it!
Long live the Colorado Party!
Could I have a cigarette?
- No, they're forbidden.
- Go and rest, Susana.
- What's happening?
- The doctors are coming.
I'm a minister.
You could give me a cigarette!
Don't move the bed any more.
Stop moving the bed.
-And Santiago?
- He's coming.
Well, as we're talking about him, there's something I must tell you.
- Shall I read it to you?
- Yes.
"l'm deaf and dumb and poor.'"' "l've six children..."
That's enough.
Get out.
Turn him out.
Go on, turn him out of here.
Goddam it, I've turned God out.
Catch him, it was God!
I've something to tell you.
I'm pregnant.
Doctor!
Nurse!
What's that, you're pregnant?
Tell me more.
It's over.
You dared to do that to me?
What son of a bitch did that to my daughter?
I'm not your daughter.
Don't you ever touch me again!
If you tell someone, I'll kill you!
No pulse anymore.
He's gone...
Aurelio!
Madam... I want to speak to my brother.
- l think it's hardly the right moment.
- No, Aurelio.
-Aurelio!
- We're very sorry.
Please...
Just a second.
-Are you one of the family?
- Yes.
Here are his things.
You can't stay here.
fructuoso!
Mummy...
Mummy, shall we sell Granny's pedestal too?
We shan't have any more furniture!
In any case we shan't have any more.
Your queer of a father will take everything.
We can't live without furniture.
Of course we can!
I'll get a good price for it.
Put down the flute and help me.
But I've a lesson.
forget it.
You've always been hopeless!
10 years we've put up with this blasted flute.
- l'll sell it too.
Give over.
- lt's mine.
I was the one who bought it.
Everything's mine: the bidet, the pedestal...
Come on, help me.
What about your exam?
I failed it.
What's d'you mean, you failed it?
But you'd promised me, fructuoso!
You were my only hope!
What about my brothers?
Good for nothings.
Your brothers are crap!
You should have been a barrister in 2 years time, an MPor senator in 3, minister in 5, president in 8.
That was the plan.
This is a communication from the armed forces.
The following have been arrested:
José Luis Noboa Rodriguez alias Raúl,
Santiago Saavedra Lamas alias Pino, convicted of association with criminals, armed robbery... and violation of the constitution.
Rodolfo...
Machado Capurro alias El Bebe for association...
They've mentioned Santiago.
It's another Santiago, they've the same name.
Get on with your homework.
Hi.
What's wrong?
is he kicking?
He wants to go out...
A real fighter.
Like us.
We've no more batteries.
Can you get me some?
I'll look upstairs.
We didn't listen to the news.
Anything new?
No, nothing.
What a sad tune!
It reminds me of my mother.
Poor dear!
Mrs. Aurora, we've finished for today.
What are you talking about, Panetti?
We're behind our schedule.
Have a little rest and then we'll do some more work.
What schedule?
Don't bother me with your questions.
It's pay day today.
We'll see to that when Aurelio comes back.
...hence President Bordaberry... has declared the dissolution of Parliament... and a halt to all political activity.
The General Military Commandment... for defence of order, peace and security... of the citizens, and the respect... of the Republican Constitution, has decreed a curfew.
Citizens will not be allowed to be out in the streets... between 7 p.m. and 7 a.m. the next day.
They said they'd arrested you.
We escaped.
How do you feel?
Given my age and my bad habits, I can't complain.
What did they do to you?
Cattle prod.
- What's that?
- lt doesn't hurt any more.
We're taking you somewhere else.
Don't go.
- You're safe here.
- Safe?
Nowhere's safe.
He must see a doctor for his internal lesions.
Gently!
My ribs!
My ribs!
We must hurry.
Come on, Pino, we must go!
It'll be ok.
Stay, please!
Stay!
Captain!
Don't touch him.

Quick!
- Let go of me!
- Captain!
They've all left, except her.
What are you doing here dressed like that?
-And you, what are you doing here?
- lt's my home.
- Take down that door!
- No.
They've escaped through a tunnel.
- Leave her alone.
- Shall we leave her here?
Yes, she's the maid.
Quick, to the church!
Let's go!
Push!
Goddam it, it's a boy!
Say something.
Speak to me.
At last!
Why have you taken so long to speak?
I promise you, for your next baptism you'll have hot water.

- Good morning, Miss Amy.
- Good morning, John.
Flintwinch!
Yeah, I hear you.
You and your blasted stick.
The girl comes this morning?
She does.
Good.
Tell her nothing!
Oh, Lord save us!
Please, ma'am, don't be alarmed.
It's Amy Dorrit, come to call on Mrs Clennam.
Oh, dear me.
Just a moment.
Jeremiah!
Now what, woman?
What's the matter with you?
Eh?
- Out of the way!
- Oh!
Yes?
What?
Amy Dorrit, sir, to see Mrs Clennam.
Ah.
Yes.
You'd better come in.
Thank you, sir.
Would I be speaking to Mr Clennam?
No, you would not.
You're very small, ain't you?
Yes, sir.
I am strong.
Are you now?
You look a shrimpy little thing to me.
Well, she's upstairs.
This way.
It's a bit dark, Sir.
She likes it dark, and I'm used to it.
Not afraid of the dark, I hope?
- No, sir.
- Good girl.
- Not afraid of me either, I hope?
- No, sir.
Well, you ought to be, cos I'm a terror when I'm roused.
Here we are.
Come.
Here she is.
You won't want me.
No, you can go.
- Amy Dorrit.
- Yes, ma'am.
Come closer.
Why, you're a child!
I'm 21, Mrs Clennam.
I know I am small, but I am quite grown up.
Are you?
Mr Casby tells me you are looking for employment.
Yes, ma'am.
I've brought some samples of my work, ma'am.
Good.
This is good neat work.
Well, Miss Dorrit,
I'm prepared to take you on approval.
General duties.
3 days a week, from 8 in the morning till 6 in the evening, 7 and 6 a week with all found.
You may start this very day.
Will that suit?
Yes, ma'am, very well, ma'am, thank you...
You'll find it quiet here.
There's only myself and Flintwinch and his wife.
My husband and son...
My husband and son are abroad.
Arthur...
Put it right.
Put it right...
Put it right.
Well, Mr Clennam!
Not long left of our deuced confinement!
What a fate!
To be quarantined in Marseilles, of all places!
- And for what?
- For no very good reason...
Except we've travelled from the East, and the East is the country of the plague, so they think.
The East?
You call Venice the East?
Do they?
Mr Clennam has been in China, Papa.
He's been away for 15 years,
I'm sure he can put up with a few more hours delay.
Besides, I've enjoying the company here.
Oh, the company!
Well, excellent company, to be sure!
Thank you, Mr Clennam...
We've enjoyed these days together, haven't we, Tattycoram?
Yes, Miss.
It's getting so hot!
Tatty, would you carry my shawl for me?
I hate you.
All of you, hate you, hate you with your kindness and your charity and your pretty faces and your baby names, like I was a toy or a doll...
Papa, shall we join Mamma downstairs?
No, no you go ahead, Pet, I'll follow on.
- À bientot, Mr Clennam!
- A presto, Miss Meagles.
You have a very lovely daughter, Mr Meagles.
Yes, yes, I do.
And Mrs Meagles and I are very glad you think so,
Mr Clennam, very glad indeed.
There you are.
Why are you always following me?
Go away!
You don't care for me!
Oh, but I do...
Harriet.
They're waiting for you.
I won't come.
I'll run away.
Or I'll curl up and die here.
No, you won't.
You'll be patient, and bear it all.
I thought they took me in to be part of their family but, they treat me like dirt.
Like I was nothing!
Well, of course they do.
I was like you once.
No...
Go away.
I'm frightened of you.
And why is that?
You see right through me... you see all my badness.
You make me worse, you make me say things I don't mean...
I...
I don't hate them.
They're good and kind, and I'm a wicked thankless creature.
Have it your own way.
Here is my address.
If ever you want to come to me... you may.
- Thank you Mr Flintwinch.
- 8 o'clock tomorrow, then.
Hold on.
Where do we send to if we need to get word to you?
Care of Mr Plornish, Bleeding Heart Yard, if you please, Mr Flintwinch.
Good day.
Didn't care to divulge her address.
Nor would you, I dare say, if you lived in a debtor's prison, Flintwinch.
Plenty of people in debtors' prisons.
Some of them even deserve to be there.
God has brought this child to my door.
I cannot avert my eyes.
Our boat is here.
We're free at last.
And you're bound for London, Mr Clennam?
Yes.
Some necessary business to settle first.
And then?
And then, I'm going to start my life all over again.
Well, now!
Oh, at last Tatty!
You can help me with these boxes.
Miss Wade, can I offer you any assistance in your arrangements?
I'm obliged to you, but I prefer to go my own way and in my own manner.
Well, goodbye Miss Wade!
I suppose we may never meet again.
In our course through life we will meet the people who are coming to meet us, Mr Meagles.
They may be coming thousands of miles over the sea;
they may be close at hand now;
they may be coming, for all you know, from the vilest sweepings of this very town.
Goodbye.
Sacrebleu!
What a hell hole this place is!
And I a gentleman, born to command.
- Sens'altro, signore.
- Sens'altro signore.
Imbecile.
What a fate!
To be locked up with a petty smuggler and I, a distinguished... murderer.
Altro, signore.
Altro.
Altro, signore!
I could murder you, here and now.
What do you say, hmm?
Two for the price of one, hmm?
Little Cavalletto.
You think I killed my wife for her money?
I would have killed her for nothing!
But can they prove it?
I think not!
I have laid out a little money, here and there...
# Qu'est-qui passe ici si tard,

Thank you, Mr Chivery.
Ah, all well Miss Amy?
Very well, thank you John.
I got the job with that Mrs Clennams.
But, please, not to tell father.
Whatever you say, Amy.
Well, I'll...
Ah!
Ah...
I looked in on your father, Amy.
He... he was fretting a bit, asking where you were.
I...
I told him, you'd be along very soon, and that calmed him.
Thank you, John, that's very kind of you.
I better go to him.
Oh, Pa!
I know, son.
I know.
Father?
- It's Amy.
- Amy...
Where have you been?
You know I don't like to be left.
But you've been well looked after, Father.
Mr Chivery and John look after you.
Yes, I suppose.
But it isn't satisfactory.
They have others to look after besides me.
What if I were to choke or have a fit, sink down in a swoon with no-one by?
And, you know...
I don't always feel they afford me the respect that is due to me.
I am sure they do, Father.
I am the Father of the Marshalsea, you know?
An honorary title, to be sure, but I fancy it carries a certain weight, a certain gravitas.
Only this morning, while you were out, a very well-connected gentleman who was visiting the establishment, upon hearing of me asked to be introduced to the Father of the Marshalsea.
I thought that was very considerate of him.
Very considerate, very civil.
Where did you go?
I went to call upon a lady, Father.
- Just a social call?
- Yes, Father, just a social call.
You weren't able to leave a card.
She didn't ask for one, Father.
It didn't arise, it wasn't necessary.
She understood you were a lady?
She understood that my daughter is a lady, the daughter of a gentleman,
- as good a lady as any other lady?
- Yes, Father, I'm sure she did.
Father, I am to go to her 3 days a week.
- But not to work!
- No.
I think she needs companionship, Father.
I need companionship!
Of course you do, Father, but Mr Chivery is here, and John, and you have so many visitors.
I never see Fanny, I never see Edward, and now I am never to see you!
It is only 3 days a week, Father.
It is necessary.
Yes.
Yes.
I understand.
Now, what shall I get you for your supper?
Oh, Amy.
I have brought disgrace upon us all.
No, you haven't, Father.
We all love you and we are all very proud of you, and everyone here looks up to you.
But it is not as it was meant to be.
You have known nothing else but if you had known me as I was before I came here, as I was before you were born...
I love you as you are.
Arthur...
Your mother, Arthur.
Put it right.
Your mother, Arthur.
Your mother...
- Chops to your satisfaction, sir?
- Yes, thank you.
Anything further, sir?
Plum pudding, glass of port, claret?
- Nothing else.
- Clear the table, sir?
- Am I incommoding you?
- Not at all, sir.
Pleasure to serve you, sir.
Stay as long as you like.
I've been putting off going somewhere I don't particularly want to go, you see.
And, er, where might that be, sir, if you don't mind me asking, sir?
- Home.
- Right you are, sir.
Leave you till tomorrow, sir?
Care to inspect a bedroom, sir?
No.
Yes.
Chaymaid!
Gentleman at table number 7 wishes to see a room!
Stay!
I've changed my mind, I'll go home.
Chaymaid!
Gentleman at table number 7 not going to sleep here.
Going home!
Oh!
Oh, Lord, save us!
- Flintwinch.
You haven't changed.
- Arthur?
Mr Arthur.
Well, I suppose you'd better come in.
You'd better let me go first.
Shock of seeing you after all these years could kill her.
Arthur?
Well, come here.
This is unexpected.
- Mother, what's happened to you?
- As you see,
I have lost the use of my limbs.
I have not been outside these doors for...
Tell him for how long.
A dozen year next Christmas.
Mother, I am afraid I've come back in unhappy circumstances.
- Is the business in trouble?
- No.
No.
May we speak in private?
Mother, I must ask you to prepare yourself.
Father passed away some three months ago, an apoplexy.
He didn't suffer long.
You need not have come half way round the world to tell me that you could have written.
I needed to see you.
I wanted to give you this.
Father was most insistent that I put it in your hand myself.
- Mother, what does it mean?
- Nothing.
It means nothing.
Affery?
!
Mr Arthur is retiring.
Affery will show you to your room.
Mother, you can't dismiss me.
There are things I need to know.
Not this evening.
Come to me tomorrow at ten.
Don't kiss me.
Only touch my hand.
Goodnight.
And here we are!
Home sweet home!
And not a finer place to be found in the whole country than dear old Twickenham!
Eh, Tattycoram?
So come on, down we get!
And down we get, Mrs Meagles!
Down we get, Pet!
- Ah, and here's Poyner.
- Welcome home, sir!
And how do we look to you, Poyner?
Oh, very well, sir, and very welcome too!
Be careful up there!
If you please, sir, Mr Gowan called, not half an hour ago, asking after Miss Pet, sir.
Mr Gowan.
I see, yes.
Did he leave any message?
Only that he'd call again tomorrow morning, sir.
Very well, then.
Let's go in.
Mrs Meagles.
- Poyner, what did Mr Gowan say?
- Well, what did you expect, Meagles?
3 months abroad would cure her passion for him?
Not hers, but his.
I thought a scoundrel like that would have less patience.
Meagles!
Mr Gowan isn't a scoundrel, he's a gentleman!
Same thing, often enough.
Come along.
She was never strong.
I should never have...
Too late now.
Father?
I wasn't asleep, you know?
Just musing upon happier times.
Happier times.
- Hello, Pa!
Hello, Amy.
- Tip!
Call him Edward, Amy.
That's his proper name.
How are you, my boy?
Oh, not so bad, Pa, not so bad.
Thought I'd look in on you.
Very good of you, Edward, to think of your old father.
Amy's always coming and going these days.
Matter of fact, I'm thinking of staying a while.
Glad to hear it, my boy.
- What's the matter, Tip?
- Nothing's the matter.
Not exactly.
Have you lost that job at the law stationers?
That one?
I didn't like it there, Amy.
I got tired of it, so I cut it.
Got another place in the fruit trade.
Cut that.
Then I got another job in the horse dealing line.
I did like that, but it didn't like me.
So here I am again, like the bad penny.
Oh, Tip, don't say that you're a prisoner.
Well, I don't want to say it, but what am I supposed to do?
- I'm in for forty pound odd.
- Forty pounds!
Looking on the bright side, at least I know the ropes.
Don't worry about me, Amy.
A little rest'll do me good!
I shall do very well here.
- Tip!
- What?
Whatever you do, don't let father know.
Eyes down!
Eat the food the good Lord provided and be thankful.
And remember, he is here in this very room and knows every wicked thought you think you keep hidden in your heart.
- Do you hear me, Arthur?
- Yes, Mother.
Yes, Mother.
Do you know, I believe you are no better than your father.
Look me in the eyes, Arthur!
Yes.
You are a vessel of sin, I believe, just like your father was and still is.
And you will bring me nothing but shame and disappointment, just as he has.
There we are, Arthur.
I brought you a nice cup of tea.
Oh, thank you, Affery.
He's down there with her.
Them two clever ones, putting their heads together.
She wants you to go down to her at ten, not before.
I can't tell you how glad I am to see you back in your own bed, Arthur.
I wish I could say the same, Affery, but it is very good to see you again.
So you... you are Mrs Flintwinch now?
- I am.
- How did that come about?
Well, I hardly know myself, Arthur.
Them two clever ones arranged it all between them, I believe.
He never courted me, you know.
"Affery," he said, "What do you think of the name Flintwinch?"
"What do I think?
," I said.
"Yes," he said,
"Because you're gonna take it.
You and me must be married."
"So if you put your bonnet on tomorrow morning at eight, we'll get it over."
He'd had the banns read and everything.
And she was all for it, Lord knows why.
So what could I say when it had got to that?
If it had been... if it had been a smothering instead of a wedding,
I don't think I could have said anything against it,
- not against them two clever ones.
- And are you happy, Affery?
Happy?
What's happy got to do with it?
- Affery!
- There's Jeremiah on the stairs!
- Where are you hiding?
- I'm here!
- I'm here, Jeremiah.
-I shan't ask you again!
Oh, Lord...
Ah, there you are, Amy.
Punctual as usual!
And how are you today?
Very well, thank you, Mrs Clennam.
And yourself?
I endure what I must, Amy.
I don't complain.
Come here and sit by me.
- Arthur's waiting.
- Let him wait.
He may come up at ten o'clock, as arranged.
I hope your father is well, my dear.
He's quite well, thank you, Mrs Clennam.
Arthur...
Your mother, Arthur.
Put it right.
She'll see you now.
Here he is.
All right, Jeremiah.
I shan't need you.
- Well?
- I've made up my mind to leave the business, Mother.
I've given almost half my life to it so far.
I felt that I owed you and my father that much.
And now...
I consider that I have discharged my debt.
I felt like a prisoner.
Now I claim my freedom.
Have you finished, Arthur, or have you anything further to say?
Er... there is something else.
What I have said concerned myself.
- This concerns us all.
- "Us all?"
- "Us all?" Who are "us all?"
- Yourself,
- myself, my dead father.
- Well?
The watch... it meant something but I don't know what.
Father died without telling me what it meant, but over and over and over before he died he pressed it into my hand saying, "Your mother.
"Your mother, Arthur.
"Put it right."
You oversaw all his dealings.
What did he mean, Mother?
- What have we done?
- How dare you!
Did it ever occur to you that he might have had any secret remembrance that caused him remorse?
Our family business was always driving hard bargains, and grasping at money.
Might it be possible that he... he wronged someone and made no reparation for it?
Flintwinch!
Flintwinch!
Come here immediately!
If we have wronged someone and reparation can be made, let us know it and make it.
Let me make it.
What?
You're hammer and tongs already, are you?
I thought as much.
What's the matter?
My son, Flintwinch, has seen fit to lay aspersions and accusations on his own father.
Oh, dear.
That's not dutiful, Mr Arthur.
This is none of your business, Flintwinch.
Oh, ain't it?
But I say it is.
Has young Arthur told you what he means to do about the business?
He has relinquished it!
Thereby giving me the pleasure of advancing an old and faithful servant.
Jeremiah, the captain has deserted the ship.
You and I will sink or float with it.
Excellent, ma'am.
I thank you with all my heart.
Right, time for your oysters!
You may leave us.
You have no further business here.
- Goodbye, Mother.
- Only touch my hand.
Now go.
Ah, Amy.
Good girl.
Don't be shy, come closer.
Thank you, Amy.
What do you still do here?
You are not wanted!
Oh, Arthur!
You gave me a start!
Tell me, Affery, who is that young girl that I saw upstairs?
Little Dorrit?
Oh, she's nothing.
She's a whim of hers, just an object of her charity, that's all.
My mother was never given to charity before.
Is she a connection of ours?
Do we know her family?
Have you taken a fancy to her?
You must have had your pick of girls out there, across the China Sea.
There were one or two, Affery.
Oh, here you are, Amy.
Sit down and eat it.
Keep your strength up.
- Do you remember your old sweetheart?
- Yes, I do, very well.
And I remember how we were separated.
Well, she's a widow now, and well to do, and if you'd like to have her, you can, so there!
You're a man of the world now, Arthur, you could have your pick of any girl you wanted.
Ah!
Home, sweet home!
Nothing to beat it!
What do you say, Tattycoram?
Nothing at all, Mr Meagles.
Nothing at all!
But you feel as I do.
I know you do, I know it!
You think you do, but in truth you know nothing at all.
Fiddlesticks!
Bother!
Oh, what's the matter, my dear?
Only that I've left my umbrella upstairs.
Oh, well, never mind, dear, Tattycoram'll fetch it for you and happy to do so, aren't you, Tattycoram?
I'll fetch it if you wish, but I don't know what makes you think I'm happy to fetch and carry and look after you all when no-one will fetch and carry and look after me!
Temper, temper!
Count to five and twenty, Tattycoram!
I can't!
It's too late!
I'm beyond myself!
Tattycoram!
Best let her go, Meagles.
She'll come to herself by and by.
Yes, mustn't worry.
Oh, well played, Pet!
I can't bear it, I can't, I can't!
Oh, Lord what's the matter with me, why am I such a wicked girl?
- Good afternoon, Harriet.
- What...
What are you doing here?
I was on my way to see you.
You didn't write.
I was worried about you.
No.
No, I won't talk to you.
- I mustn't!
- Oh, but I think you will, Harriet.
I think you must.
And so the day of reckoning!
Rigaud is to face the full majesty of the court.
And I shall triumph, I believe.
Their witnesses will melt away, their evidence will crumble into dust.
Sens'altro, signore, sens'altro.
- Monsieur Rigaud.
- Ah, Monsieur le Jailer.
The President of the Court has decided there is not enough evidence to convict you and you are free to go, but there is a crowd out there,
- and they don't love you.
- Rabble!
I despise them.
I suggest you get as far away from here as you can.
- Monsieur Rigaud, time to go!
- Cavalletto...
You and I will meet again one day,
I believe.
And what will I do with you then?
Huh?
Eat you, perhaps.
- Altro, altro.
- Altro.
Altro.
Lead on, monsieur le jailer!
# Qu'est-ce qui passe ici si tard, compagnons de la marjolaine

Curse on this poxy weather!
Rigaud is down for now, never mind.
Rigaud will rise again.
Monsieur!
Monsieur, arrêt!
Pour le nom de dieu!

Cochon!

- Hello, John.
- Miss Amy...
- I picked up a little something.
- Thank you, John.
I should go up now.
- Good evening.
- Oh, good evening.
I...
I wonder, could you... could you tell me, what place is this?
- This place?
Well, it's the Marshalsea.
- The debtors' prison?
That's it, sir, yes.
Yes, the debtors' prison.
I...
I beg your pardon.
Can anyone go in there?
Oh, yes, yes.
Anyone may go in, sir.
It's not everyone who may go out.
May I walk in with you?
I should count it an honour, sir.
Thank you, Mr Chivery.
Frederick.
Er, just... do you know anyone that lives here by the name of Dorrit?
- My name is Dorrit.
Frederick Dorrit.
- Do you live here?
Not as an inmate, never as an... er... as an inmate.
My brother William Dorrit is in residence here.
Ah, I beg your pardon, I had no idea.
Let me explain.
I have recently come back from a long absence overseas.
I have seen a young woman who works at my mother's house,
Mrs Clennam in the City.
This young woman I know only as Little Dorrit.
I saw her come in at these gates not five minutes ago.
The young woman whom you saw is my brother's child.
Ah.
I should like to know more about her, and to help her, if I can.
Help her, sir?
Does not your mother help her?
Oh, I assure you sir, I have no ignoble designs upon her.
Well, if you wish, you may come with me.
Thank you.
Very kind of young John.
A very handsome consideration, delicately expressed.
I hope you showed him proper thanks, Amy.
William, this gentleman is Mr Clennam, son of Mrs Clennam,
Amy's... friend.
He wishes to pay his respects.
Mr Clennam, you do me honour, sir.
Frederick, my chair.
Pray, pray sit down, Mr Clennam.
You are welcome to the Marshalsea.
Yes, I've welcomed many fine gentlemen here.
Perhaps you're aware - my daughter may have mentioned it - that I am known as The Father of the Marshalsea.
An honorary title, to be sure, but one that gives me much gratification.
- Father!
- You know, I dare say,
- that my daughter Amy was born here?
- No.
No, I did not, sir.
- Some might think that a disgrace.
- No, indeed.
She's a good girl, sir, a dear girl.
Amy, put the dish down.
Would you do me the honour, sir, of sharing my humble repast?
No...
Not a morsel.
I have dined.
My elder daughter Fanny, does not live with me, but with my bro...
What have you done with Fanny, Frederick?
Erm... believe she's out walking with Tip.
Edward!
Edward!
Have the goodness to use the correct nomenclature.
My son Edward, Mr Clennam, he's a little wild, but he's a good lad at heart.
- Your first visit here, sir?
- Yes, my very first, Mr Dorrit.
I wonder, could I ask you, before your arrival here, did you have any business with the House of Clennam?
Clennam?
No, you, sir, are the first Clennam it's been my pleasure to meet.
Though I've welcomed many fine gentlemen here.
Amy, what was the name of the gentleman from Camberwell
- who was here last Sunday?
- I can't recall, Father.
Oh, of course you can, of course you can.
The one who performed that handsome action with so much delicacy.
Oh, tush!
His name has quite escaped me.
But, as I was saying Mr Clennam, a handsome and delicate action, you might like to know what it was.
Yes, yes, indeed.
You, you, you must know, Mr Clennam, that it does sometimes occur to a gentlemen, er... who come here, to offer some small... testimonial to the Father of the Marshalsea.
Sometimes it takes one shape, and sometimes another, but it's generally...
Money.
- I see.
- Now, the gentleman from Camberwell, made a gesture of peculiar delicacy...
He brought a bunch of geraniums;
gardens not being accessible to me, a bunch of geraniums, which, upon closer inspection, was found to contain a twist of paper,
with two guineas inside!
A handsome and delicate action...
- I was never more pleased.
- Father, please stop.
- Mr Clennam doesn't want to hear this.
- Oh, nonsense Amy.
Mr Clennam and I understand one other perfectly,
- I believe.
- I should say so.
What does she want now?
Her and her blasted stick...
Downstairs there's a wooden box containing legal documents and other papers.
You know the one I mean.
- I do.
- Bring them to me.
I want to see them destroyed, Flintwinch.
Destroyed, not hidden.
Understood.
It's imperative that my son should never see them.
Understood.
Understood and all in hand.
Good.
And he was a very distinguished gentleman, and was kind enough to leave a little testimonial, which he managed with
- great delicacy.
- I'm sure he did.
Er... do you happen to know where Miss Dorrit has gone?
I'd like a word with her before I leave.
She should be here!
She's away far too much.
And as for my other children...
Ah my dears!
I was just speaking of you.
Mr Clennam, may I present my elder daughter Fanny, and my son Edward.
The bell, ah yes, that's a signal for visitors to, er... retire.
Fanny's come to say goodbye.
Don't be alarmed, there's plenty of time, plenty of time before the gate is locked.
How do you do, Miss Dorrit, Mr Dorrit?
Charmed, I'm sure.
I only came to get my clean dress from Amy, father.
- Where is she gone?
- Here I am, here's your dress, Fanny.
- It's mended and made up?
- Yes.
- How about my waistcoat?
- Good girl.
Come, Fanny, come now, it's nearly time for the lock!
All right, Uncle...
Bye, Pa!
Make haste, Mr Clennam.
'Less you want to spend the night here.
I'll be with you directly.
Mr Dorrit, would you allow me...
Mr Clennam, I'm...
I'm deeply,
- deeply moved.
- Please, Mr Dorrit, say no more.
You must come and visit us again.
Amy, show our friend the way.
All visitors time to leave.
All out, please all out.
- There's the gate.
Good evening, sir.
- Forgive me...
- May we have a few words?
- Why did you follow me, sir?
I could not speak to you in private at my mother's house.
You've seen how it is between her and me.
But I should like to ask you about my mother's reasons for employing you.
I believe your mother employed me on merit.
The bell will stop and you'll be locked in.
You must go.
- May I speak with you again, Amy?
- Yes, I suppose so.
How can I stop you?
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude.
Good evening.
Oh, I say?
Could you open the gate?
I was delayed.
Can't be done, sir, more than me life's worth.
You're here for the night now.
Good God.
Caught you, have they, Mr Clennam?
You'll have to be sharper than that next time.
Er... surely you're locked in too.
Why, so I am!
But not in your way.
I belong to the shop, only, er... the guvnor's not supposed to know about it.
Can I get any shelter here?
Well.
If you don't mind paying, they'll make you up a bed in the snuggery.
It ain't as snug as it sounds, mind.
Not like home.
I'm sure it'll serve well enough for one night.
Come along then, Mr Clennam.
I'll see you all right.
- Thank you.
- This way, Mr Clennam.
This way.
There, all gone.
Thank you, Flintwinch.
Jeremiah?
All clear.
Jeremiah?
Sit down.
What about that glass you said I could have?
Here.
Drink it, choke yourself.
Mrs Clennam's port wine.
Very nice, her health.
Your health, his health and all friends round St Paul's.
Where's the box?
All here, Jeremiah.
- Heavy enough.
- Take care.
Guard it with your life.
Affery!
What are you about, you silly old woman?
You've been getting out of bed in your sleep!
Dreaming!
You slip back up to bed.
And if you ever have such a dream again, it's a sign you're in want of physic!
And I'll give you such a dose, old woman...
Such a dose!
Now, off with you!
All clear.
You guard it with your life, Ephraim.
Yes, Jeremiah, safe with me.
Ah, well done Mrs Dorrit, a very nice little... girl indeed!
Yes, ah, there's a pretty!
Now, would you care to hold her, Mr Dorrit?
There, there.
There she is.
The first child of the Marshalsea, Mr Dorrit.
Now, ain't that a distinction?
A new little Dorrit!
Little Amy!

- Good morning, Miss Amy.
- Good morning, John.
Flintwinch!
Yeah, I hear you.
You and your blasted stick.
The girl comes this morning?
She does.
Good.
Tell her nothing!
Oh, Lord save us!
Please, ma'am, don't be alarmed.
It's Amy Dorrit, come to call on Mrs Clennam.
Oh, dear me.
Just a moment.
Jeremiah!
Now what, woman?
What's the matter with you?
Eh?
- Out of the way!
- Oh!
Yes?
What?
Amy Dorrit, sir, to see Mrs Clennam.
Ah.
Yes.
You'd better come in.
Thank you, sir.
Would I be speaking to Mr Clennam?
No, you would not.
You're very small, ain't you?
Yes, sir.
I am strong.
Are you now?
You look a shrimpy little thing to me.
Well, she's upstairs.
This way.
It's a bit dark, Sir.
She likes it dark, and I'm used to it.
Not afraid of the dark, I hope?
- No, sir.
- Good girl.
- Not afraid of me either, I hope?
- No, sir.
Well, you ought to be, cos I'm a terror when I'm roused.
Here we are.
Come.
Here she is.
You won't want me.
No, you can go.
- Amy Dorrit.
- Yes, ma'am.
Come closer.
Why, you're a child!
I'm 21, Mrs Clennam.
I know I am small, but I am quite grown up.
Are you?
Mr Casby tells me you are looking for employment.
Yes, ma'am.
I've brought some samples of my work, ma'am.
Good.
This is good neat work.
Well, Miss Dorrit,
I'm prepared to take you on approval.
General duties.
3 days a week, from 8 in the morning till 6 in the evening, 7 and 6 a week with all found.
You may start this very day.
Will that suit?
Yes, ma'am, very well, ma'am, thank you...
You'll find it quiet here.
There's only myself and Flintwinch and his wife.
My husband and son...
My husband and son are abroad.
Arthur...
Put it right.
Put it right...
Put it right.
Well, Mr Clennam!
Not long left of our deuced confinement!
What a fate!
To be quarantined in Marseilles, of all places!
- And for what?
- For no very good reason...
Except we've travelled from the East, and the East is the country of the plague, so they think.
The East?
You call Venice the East?
Do they?
Mr Clennam has been in China, Papa.
He's been away for 15 years,
I'm sure he can put up with a few more hours delay.
Besides, I've enjoying the company here.
Oh, the company!
Well, excellent company, to be sure!
Thank you, Mr Clennam...
We've enjoyed these days together, haven't we, Tattycoram?
Yes, Miss.
It's getting so hot!
Tatty, would you carry my shawl for me?
I hate you.
All of you, hate you, hate you with your kindness and your charity and your pretty faces and your baby names, like I was a toy or a doll...
Papa, shall we join Mamma downstairs?
No, no you go ahead, Pet, I'll follow on.
- À bientot, Mr Clennam!
- A presto, Miss Meagles.
You have a very lovely daughter, Mr Meagles.
Yes, yes, I do.
And Mrs Meagles and I are very glad you think so,
Mr Clennam, very glad indeed.
There you are.
Why are you always following me?
Go away!
You don't care for me!
Oh, but I do...
Harriet.
They're waiting for you.
I won't come.
I'll run away.
Or I'll curl up and die here.
No, you won't.
You'll be patient, and bear it all.
I thought they took me in to be part of their family but, they treat me like dirt.
Like I was nothing!
Well, of course they do.
I was like you once.
No...
Go away.
I'm frightened of you.
And why is that?
You see right through me... you see all my badness.
You make me worse, you make me say things I don't mean...
I...
I don't hate them.
They're good and kind, and I'm a wicked thankless creature.
Have it your own way.
Here is my address.
If ever you want to come to me... you may.
- Thank you Mr Flintwinch.
- 8 o'clock tomorrow, then.
Hold on.
Where do we send to if we need to get word to you?
Care of Mr Plornish, Bleeding Heart Yard, if you please, Mr Flintwinch.
Good day.
Didn't care to divulge her address.
Nor would you, I dare say, if you lived in a debtor's prison, Flintwinch.
Plenty of people in debtors' prisons.
Some of them even deserve to be there.
God has brought this child to my door.
I cannot avert my eyes.
Our boat is here.
We're free at last.
And you're bound for London, Mr Clennam?
Yes.
Some necessary business to settle first.
And then?
And then, I'm going to start my life all over again.
Well, now!
Oh, at last Tatty!
You can help me with these boxes.
Miss Wade, can I offer you any assistance in your arrangements?
I'm obliged to you, but I prefer to go my own way and in my own manner.
Well, goodbye Miss Wade!
I suppose we may never meet again.
In our course through life we will meet the people who are coming to meet us, Mr Meagles.
They may be coming thousands of miles over the sea;
they may be close at hand now;
they may be coming, for all you know, from the vilest sweepings of this very town.
Goodbye.
Sacrebleu!
What a hell hole this place is!
And I a gentleman, born to command.
- Sens'altro, signore.
- Sens'altro signore.
Imbecile.
What a fate!
To be locked up with a petty smuggler and I, a distinguished... murderer.
Altro, signore.
Altro.
Altro, signore!
I could murder you, here and now.
What do you say, hmm?
Two for the price of one, hmm?
Little Cavalletto.
You think I killed my wife for her money?
I would have killed her for nothing!
But can they prove it?
I think not!
I have laid out a little money, here and there...

Thank you, Mr Chivery.
Ah, all well Miss Amy?
Very well, thank you John.
I got the job with that Mrs Clennams.
But, please, not to tell father.
Whatever you say, Amy.
Well, I'll...
Ah!
Ah...
I looked in on your father, Amy.
He... he was fretting a bit, asking where you were.
I...
I told him, you'd be along very soon, and that calmed him.
Thank you, John, that's very kind of you.
I better go to him.
Oh, Pa!
I know, son.
I know.
Father?
- It's Amy.
- Amy...
Where have you been?
You know I don't like to be left.
But you've been well looked after, Father.
Mr Chivery and John look after you.
Yes, I suppose.
But it isn't satisfactory.
They have others to look after besides me.
What if I were to choke or have a fit, sink down in a swoon with no-one by?
And, you know...
I don't always feel they afford me the respect that is due to me.
I am sure they do, Father.
I am the Father of the Marshalsea, you know?
An honorary title, to be sure, but I fancy it carries a certain weight, a certain gravitas.
Only this morning, while you were out, a very well-connected gentleman who was visiting the establishment, upon hearing of me asked to be introduced to the Father of the Marshalsea.
I thought that was very considerate of him.
Very considerate, very civil.
Where did you go?
I went to call upon a lady, Father.
- Just a social call?
- Yes, Father, just a social call.
You weren't able to leave a card.
She didn't ask for one, Father.
It didn't arise, it wasn't necessary.
She understood you were a lady?
She understood that my daughter is a lady, the daughter of a gentleman,
- as good a lady as any other lady?
- Yes, Father, I'm sure she did.
Father, I am to go to her 3 days a week.
- But not to work!
- No.
I think she needs companionship, Father.
I need companionship!
Of course you do, Father, but Mr Chivery is here, and John, and you have so many visitors.
I never see Fanny, I never see Edward, and now I am never to see you!
It is only 3 days a week, Father.
It is necessary.
Yes.
Yes.
I understand.
Now, what shall I get you for your supper?
Oh, Amy.
I have brought disgrace upon us all.
No, you haven't, Father.
We all love you and we are all very proud of you, and everyone here looks up to you.
But it is not as it was meant to be.
You have known nothing else but if you had known me as I was before I came here, as I was before you were born...
I love you as you are.
Arthur...
Your mother, Arthur.
Put it right.
Your mother, Arthur.
Your mother...
- Chops to your satisfaction, sir?
- Yes, thank you.
Anything further, sir?
Plum pudding, glass of port, claret?
- Nothing else.
- Clear the table, sir?
- Am I incommoding you?
- Not at all, sir.
Pleasure to serve you, sir.
Stay as long as you like.
I've been putting off going somewhere I don't particularly want to go, you see.
And, er, where might that be, sir, if you don't mind me asking, sir?
- Home.
- Right you are, sir.
Leave you till tomorrow, sir?
Care to inspect a bedroom, sir?
No.
Yes.
Chaymaid!
Gentleman at table number 7 wishes to see a room!
Stay!
I've changed my mind, I'll go home.
Chaymaid!
Gentleman at table number 7 not going to sleep here.
Going home!
Oh!
Oh, Lord, save us!
- Flintwinch.
You haven't changed.
- Arthur?
Mr Arthur.
Well, I suppose you'd better come in.
You'd better let me go first.
Shock of seeing you after all these years could kill her.
Arthur?
Well, come here.
This is unexpected.
- Mother, what's happened to you?
- As you see,
I have lost the use of my limbs.
I have not been outside these doors for...
Tell him for how long.
A dozen year next Christmas.
Mother, I am afraid I've come back in unhappy circumstances.
- Is the business in trouble?
- No.
No.
May we speak in private?
Mother, I must ask you to prepare yourself.
Father passed away some three months ago, an apoplexy.
He didn't suffer long.
You need not have come half way round the world to tell me that you could have written.
I needed to see you.
I wanted to give you this.
Father was most insistent that I put it in your hand myself.
- Mother, what does it mean?
- Nothing.
It means nothing.
Affery?
!
Mr Arthur is retiring.
Affery will show you to your room.
Mother, you can't dismiss me.
There are things I need to know.
Not this evening.
Come to me tomorrow at ten.
Don't kiss me.
Only touch my hand.
Goodnight.
And here we are!
Home sweet home!
And not a finer place to be found in the whole country than dear old Twickenham!
Eh, Tattycoram?
So come on, down we get!
And down we get, Mrs Meagles!
Down we get, Pet!
- Ah, and here's Poyner.
- Welcome home, sir!
And how do we look to you, Poyner?
Oh, very well, sir, and very welcome too!
Be careful up there!
If you please, sir, Mr Gowan called, not half an hour ago, asking after Miss Pet, sir.
Mr Gowan.
I see, yes.
Did he leave any message?
Only that he'd call again tomorrow morning, sir.
Very well, then.
Let's go in.
Mrs Meagles.
- Poyner, what did Mr Gowan say?
- Well, what did you expect, Meagles?
3 months abroad would cure her passion for him?
Not hers, but his.
I thought a scoundrel like that would have less patience.
Meagles!
Mr Gowan isn't a scoundrel, he's a gentleman!
Same thing, often enough.
Come along.
She was never strong.
I should never have...
Too late now.
Father?
I wasn't asleep, you know?
Just musing upon happier times.
Happier times.
- Hello, Pa!
Hello, Amy.
- Tip!
Call him Edward, Amy.
That's his proper name.
How are you, my boy?
Oh, not so bad, Pa, not so bad.
Thought I'd look in on you.
Very good of you, Edward, to think of your old father.
Amy's always coming and going these days.
Matter of fact, I'm thinking of staying a while.
Glad to hear it, my boy.
- What's the matter, Tip?
- Nothing's the matter.
Not exactly.
Have you lost that job at the law stationers?
That one?
I didn't like it there, Amy.
I got tired of it, so I cut it.
Got another place in the fruit trade.
Cut that.
Then I got another job in the horse dealing line.
I did like that, but it didn't like me.
So here I am again, like the bad penny.
Oh, Tip, don't say that you're a prisoner.
Well, I don't want to say it, but what am I supposed to do?
- I'm in for forty pound odd.
- Forty pounds!
Looking on the bright side, at least I know the ropes.
Don't worry about me, Amy.
A little rest'll do me good!
I shall do very well here.
- Tip!
- What?
Whatever you do, don't let father know.
Eyes down!
Eat the food the good Lord provided and be thankful.
And remember, he is here in this very room and knows every wicked thought you think you keep hidden in your heart.
- Do you hear me, Arthur?
- Yes, Mother.
Yes, Mother.
Do you know, I believe you are no better than your father.
Look me in the eyes, Arthur!
Yes.
You are a vessel of sin, I believe, just like your father was and still is.
And you will bring me nothing but shame and disappointment, just as he has.
There we are, Arthur.
I brought you a nice cup of tea.
Oh, thank you, Affery.
He's down there with her.
Them two clever ones, putting their heads together.
She wants you to go down to her at ten, not before.
I can't tell you how glad I am to see you back in your own bed, Arthur.
I wish I could say the same, Affery, but it is very good to see you again.
So you... you are Mrs Flintwinch now?
- I am.
- How did that come about?
Well, I hardly know myself, Arthur.
Them two clever ones arranged it all between them, I believe.
He never courted me, you know.
"Affery," he said, "What do you think of the name Flintwinch?"
"What do I think?
," I said.
"Yes," he said,
"Because you're gonna take it.
You and me must be married."
"So if you put your bonnet on tomorrow morning at eight, we'll get it over."
He'd had the banns read and everything.
And she was all for it, Lord knows why.
So what could I say when it had got to that?
If it had been... if it had been a smothering instead of a wedding,
I don't think I could have said anything against it,
- not against them two clever ones.
- And are you happy, Affery?
Happy?
What's happy got to do with it?
- Affery!
- There's Jeremiah on the stairs!
- Where are you hiding?
- I'm here!
- I'm here, Jeremiah.
-I shan't ask you again!
Oh, Lord...
Ah, there you are, Amy.
Punctual as usual!
And how are you today?
Very well, thank you, Mrs Clennam.
And yourself?
I endure what I must, Amy.
I don't complain.
Come here and sit by me.
- Arthur's waiting.
- Let him wait.
He may come up at ten o'clock, as arranged.
I hope your father is well, my dear.
He's quite well, thank you, Mrs Clennam.
Arthur...
Your mother, Arthur.
Put it right.
She'll see you now.
Here he is.
All right, Jeremiah.
I shan't need you.
- Well?
- I've made up my mind to leave the business, Mother.
I've given almost half my life to it so far.
I felt that I owed you and my father that much.
And now...
I consider that I have discharged my debt.
I felt like a prisoner.
Now I claim my freedom.
Have you finished, Arthur, or have you anything further to say?
Er... there is something else.
What I have said concerned myself.
- This concerns us all.
- "Us all?"
- "Us all?" Who are "us all?"
- Yourself,
- myself, my dead father.
- Well?
The watch... it meant something but I don't know what.
Father died without telling me what it meant, but over and over and over before he died he pressed it into my hand saying, "Your mother.
"Your mother, Arthur.
"Put it right."
You oversaw all his dealings.
What did he mean, Mother?
- What have we done?
- How dare you!
Did it ever occur to you that he might have had any secret remembrance that caused him remorse?
Our family business was always driving hard bargains, and grasping at money.
Might it be possible that he... he wronged someone and made no reparation for it?
Flintwinch!
Flintwinch!
Come here immediately!
If we have wronged someone and reparation can be made, let us know it and make it.
Let me make it.
What?
You're hammer and tongs already, are you?
I thought as much.
What's the matter?
My son, Flintwinch, has seen fit to lay aspersions and accusations on his own father.
Oh, dear.
That's not dutiful, Mr Arthur.
This is none of your business, Flintwinch.
Oh, ain't it?
But I say it is.
Has young Arthur told you what he means to do about the business?
He has relinquished it!
Thereby giving me the pleasure of advancing an old and faithful servant.
Jeremiah, the captain has deserted the ship.
You and I will sink or float with it.
Excellent, ma'am.
I thank you with all my heart.
Right, time for your oysters!
You may leave us.
You have no further business here.
- Goodbye, Mother.
- Only touch my hand.
Now go.
Ah, Amy.
Good girl.
Don't be shy, come closer.
Thank you, Amy.
What do you still do here?
You are not wanted!
Oh, Arthur!
You gave me a start!
Tell me, Affery, who is that young girl that I saw upstairs?
Little Dorrit?
Oh, she's nothing.
She's a whim of hers, just an object of her charity, that's all.
My mother was never given to charity before.
Is she a connection of ours?
Do we know her family?
Have you taken a fancy to her?
You must have had your pick of girls out there, across the China Sea.
There were one or two, Affery.
Oh, here you are, Amy.
Sit down and eat it.
Keep your strength up.
- Do you remember your old sweetheart?
- Yes, I do, very well.
And I remember how we were separated.
Well, she's a widow now, and well to do, and if you'd like to have her, you can, so there!
You're a man of the world now, Arthur, you could have your pick of any girl you wanted.
Ah!
Home, sweet home!
Nothing to beat it!
What do you say, Tattycoram?
Nothing at all, Mr Meagles.
Nothing at all!
But you feel as I do.
I know you do, I know it!
You think you do, but in truth you know nothing at all.
Fiddlesticks!
Bother!
Oh, what's the matter, my dear?
Only that I've left my umbrella upstairs.
Oh, well, never mind, dear, Tattycoram'll fetch it for you and happy to do so, aren't you, Tattycoram?
I'll fetch it if you wish, but I don't know what makes you think I'm happy to fetch and carry and look after you all when no-one will fetch and carry and look after me!
Temper, temper!
Count to five and twenty, Tattycoram!
I can't!
It's too late!
I'm beyond myself!
Tattycoram!
Best let her go, Meagles.
She'll come to herself by and by.
Yes, mustn't worry.
Oh, well played, Pet!
I can't bear it, I can't, I can't!
Oh, Lord what's the matter with me, why am I such a wicked girl?
- Good afternoon, Harriet.
- What...
What are you doing here?
I was on my way to see you.
You didn't write.
I was worried about you.
No.
No, I won't talk to you.
- I mustn't!
- Oh, but I think you will, Harriet.
I think you must.
And so the day of reckoning!
Rigaud is to face the full majesty of the court.
And I shall triumph, I believe.
Their witnesses will melt away, their evidence will crumble into dust.
Sens'altro, signore, sens'altro.
- Monsieur Rigaud.
- Ah, Monsieur le Jailer.
The President of the Court has decided there is not enough evidence to convict you and you are free to go, but there is a crowd out there,
- and they don't love you.
- Rabble!
I despise them.
I suggest you get as far away from here as you can.
- Monsieur Rigaud, time to go!
- Cavalletto...
You and I will meet again one day,
I believe.
And what will I do with you then?
Huh?
Eat you, perhaps.
- Altro, altro.
- Altro.
Altro.
Lead on, monsieur le jailer!

Rigaud will rise again.

- Hello, John.
- Miss Amy...
- I picked up a little something.
- Thank you, John.
I should go up now.
- Good evening.
- Oh, good evening.
I...
I wonder, could you... could you tell me, what place is this?
- This place?
Well, it's the Marshalsea.
- The debtors' prison?
That's it, sir, yes.
Yes, the debtors' prison.
I...
I beg your pardon.
Can anyone go in there?
Oh, yes, yes.
Anyone may go in, sir.
It's not everyone who may go out.
May I walk in with you?
I should count it an honour, sir.
Thank you, Mr Chivery.
Frederick.
Er, just... do you know anyone that lives here by the name of Dorrit?
- My name is Dorrit.
Frederick Dorrit.
- Do you live here?
Not as an inmate, never as an... er... as an inmate.
My brother William Dorrit is in residence here.
Ah, I beg your pardon, I had no idea.
Let me explain.
I have recently come back from a long absence overseas.
I have seen a young woman who works at my mother's house,
Mrs Clennam in the City.
This young woman I know only as Little Dorrit.
I saw her come in at these gates not five minutes ago.
The young woman whom you saw is my brother's child.
Ah.
I should like to know more about her, and to help her, if I can.
Help her, sir?
Does not your mother help her?
Oh, I assure you sir, I have no ignoble designs upon her.
Well, if you wish, you may come with me.
Thank you.
Very kind of young John.
A very handsome consideration, delicately expressed.
I hope you showed him proper thanks, Amy.
William, this gentleman is Mr Clennam, son of Mrs Clennam,
Amy's... friend.
He wishes to pay his respects.
Mr Clennam, you do me honour, sir.
Frederick, my chair.
Pray, pray sit down, Mr Clennam.
You are welcome to the Marshalsea.
Yes, I've welcomed many fine gentlemen here.
Perhaps you're aware - my daughter may have mentioned it - that I am known as The Father of the Marshalsea.
An honorary title, to be sure, but one that gives me much gratification.
- Father!
- You know, I dare say,
- that my daughter Amy was born here?
- No.
No, I did not, sir.
- Some might think that a disgrace.
- No, indeed.
She's a good girl, sir, a dear girl.
Amy, put the dish down.
Would you do me the honour, sir, of sharing my humble repast?
No...
Not a morsel.
I have dined.
My elder daughter Fanny, does not live with me, but with my bro...
What have you done with Fanny, Frederick?
Erm... believe she's out walking with Tip.
Edward!
Edward!
Have the goodness to use the correct nomenclature.
My son Edward, Mr Clennam, he's a little wild, but he's a good lad at heart.
- Your first visit here, sir?
- Yes, my very first, Mr Dorrit.
I wonder, could I ask you, before your arrival here, did you have any business with the House of Clennam?
Clennam?
No, you, sir, are the first Clennam it's been my pleasure to meet.
Though I've welcomed many fine gentlemen here.
Amy, what was the name of the gentleman from Camberwell
- who was here last Sunday?
- I can't recall, Father.
Oh, of course you can, of course you can.
The one who performed that handsome action with so much delicacy.
Oh, tush!
His name has quite escaped me.
But, as I was saying Mr Clennam, a handsome and delicate action, you might like to know what it was.
Yes, yes, indeed.
You, you, you must know, Mr Clennam, that it does sometimes occur to a gentlemen, er... who come here, to offer some small... testimonial to the Father of the Marshalsea.
Sometimes it takes one shape, and sometimes another, but it's generally...
Money.
- I see.
- Now, the gentleman from Camberwell, made a gesture of peculiar delicacy...
He brought a bunch of geraniums;
gardens not being accessible to me, a bunch of geraniums, which, upon closer inspection, was found to contain a twist of paper,
with two guineas inside!
A handsome and delicate action...
- I was never more pleased.
- Father, please stop.
- Mr Clennam doesn't want to hear this.
- Oh, nonsense Amy.
Mr Clennam and I understand one other perfectly,
- I believe.
- I should say so.
What does she want now?
Her and her blasted stick...
Downstairs there's a wooden box containing legal documents and other papers.
You know the one I mean.
- I do.
- Bring them to me.
I want to see them destroyed, Flintwinch.
Destroyed, not hidden.
Understood.
It's imperative that my son should never see them.
Understood.
Understood and all in hand.
Good.
And he was a very distinguished gentleman, and was kind enough to leave a little testimonial, which he managed with
- great delicacy.
- I'm sure he did.
Er... do you happen to know where Miss Dorrit has gone?
I'd like a word with her before I leave.
She should be here!
She's away far too much.
And as for my other children...
Ah my dears!
I was just speaking of you.
Mr Clennam, may I present my elder daughter Fanny, and my son Edward.
The bell, ah yes, that's a signal for visitors to, er... retire.
Fanny's come to say goodbye.
Don't be alarmed, there's plenty of time, plenty of time before the gate is locked.
How do you do, Miss Dorrit, Mr Dorrit?
Charmed, I'm sure.
I only came to get my clean dress from Amy, father.
- Where is she gone?
- Here I am, here's your dress, Fanny.
- It's mended and made up?
- Yes.
- How about my waistcoat?
- Good girl.
Come, Fanny, come now, it's nearly time for the lock!
All right, Uncle...
Bye, Pa!
Make haste, Mr Clennam.
'Less you want to spend the night here.
I'll be with you directly.
Mr Dorrit, would you allow me...
Mr Clennam, I'm...
I'm deeply,
- deeply moved.
- Please, Mr Dorrit, say no more.
You must come and visit us again.
Amy, show our friend the way.
All visitors time to leave.
All out, please all out.
- There's the gate.
Good evening, sir.
- Forgive me...
- May we have a few words?
- Why did you follow me, sir?
I could not speak to you in private at my mother's house.
You've seen how it is between her and me.
But I should like to ask you about my mother's reasons for employing you.
I believe your mother employed me on merit.
The bell will stop and you'll be locked in.
You must go.
- May I speak with you again, Amy?
- Yes, I suppose so.
How can I stop you?
I'm sorry, I don't mean to be rude.
Good evening.
Oh, I say?
Could you open the gate?
I was delayed.
Can't be done, sir, more than me life's worth.
You're here for the night now.
Good God.
Caught you, have they, Mr Clennam?
You'll have to be sharper than that next time.
Er... surely you're locked in too.
Why, so I am!
But not in your way.
I belong to the shop, only, er... the guvnor's not supposed to know about it.
Can I get any shelter here?
Well.
If you don't mind paying, they'll make you up a bed in the snuggery.
It ain't as snug as it sounds, mind.
Not like home.
I'm sure it'll serve well enough for one night.
Come along then, Mr Clennam.
I'll see you all right.
- Thank you.
- This way, Mr Clennam.
This way.
There, all gone.
Thank you, Flintwinch.
Jeremiah?
All clear.
Jeremiah?
Sit down.
What about that glass you said I could have?
Here.
Drink it, choke yourself.
Mrs Clennam's port wine.
Very nice, her health.
Your health, his health and all friends round St Paul's.
Where's the box?
All here, Jeremiah.
- Heavy enough.
- Take care.
Guard it with your life.
Affery!
What are you about, you silly old woman?
You've been getting out of bed in your sleep!
Dreaming!
You slip back up to bed.
And if you ever have such a dream again, it's a sign you're in want of physic!
And I'll give you such a dose, old woman...
Such a dose!
Now, off with you!
All clear.
You guard it with your life, Ephraim.
Yes, Jeremiah, safe with me.
Based on a novel by Helene Tursten
THE GLASS DEVIL
Hi.
Take a look at this.
Come here.
Jacob Schyttelius, 42 years old.
No children.
Been divorced for two years.
Elementary school teacher.
Next ofkin:
His sister, Rebecka, a computer consultant in Stockholm, and theirparents, Sten and Elsa, who live at the vicarage next door.
Hello?
Anyone home?
Irene?
Sten, Elsa and Jacob Schyttelius were murdered last night.
Shot at close range with a rifle.
Practically executed.
What do we know about the daughter, Rebecka Schyttelius?
The police up in Stockholm are going to interview herlater on today.
Shouldrt we talk to her, Andersson?
It's our case, after all.
- That's what I said...
- I could stream the interview.
- "Steam"?
- That's "stream", you see it online.
- What about these starthings?
- The blood's from our vics.
- But what's their significance?
- How nice of you to ask...
Apentagram is not necessarily a symbol of evil, but if you invert it, it becomes charged with magic.
An image of the devil emerges.
- Acommon Satanist symbol.
- What is this, "The Da Vinci Code"?
- We found these at Jacob's place.
- They've been targeted before.
Anyone remember the "Purple Pastor"?
- What was the "Purple Pastor"?
- Acase, 7 or 8 years back.
We never did crack the case, but the evidence suggested Satanists.
The victim, anothervicar, was wrapped in a purple cape, and he was stabbed in the back seven times.
All seven wounds were made by different people using the same knife.
Some were shallow, while others had been made with great force.
And here's the knife.
This photo was taken five years ago, by a surveillance camera over at Haga Church.
It was taken when a crucifix was stolen.
We don't know who the man is.
Possibly the leader of the Satanist cult.
So what's the connection to the Schyttelius family?
The "Purple Pastor" was found in a chapel that belongs to Schyttelius' parish.
The cult held their meetings there.
- We should check out that chapel.
- That might be diffiicult...
You see, it burnt down five years ago.
Hey!
Would that be Jacob's and Sters computers you have there?
- Find anything interesting?
- Jacob's was wiped clean.
But Sters was still processing when I got to it.
- Could you make it stop?
- All you have to do is unplug it.
- What the hell's on it, then?
- Well, I can't seem to gain access.
- I need a password or something.
- "Amen."
- What?
- Or"hallelujah".
Well, hello there, little fellow...
Come to Mummy...
Mum, look!
Just look at what that awful creature's done!
- Our awful neighbours' awful cat!
- What's going on?
I hung this out to dry, and I found it in the bushes, all tom up and dirty!
And if you don't do something about it, I will!
Katarina, please...
Come on, sweetie...
What am I supposed to do, Sammie?
Teenagers!
No...
No, Sammie.
Heel.
Heel, Sammie.
Did yourparents and your brother have any enemies you knew of?
- What about you, any threats?
- No.
- Please describe your relationship.
- What do you mean?
Did you see and call each other regularly?
- Where were you last night?
- At the office, working.
- Alone?
- No, I was with my associate.
- Christian Levenolz.
- And you both worked all night?
If you think of anything, please get in touch with us.
- Right...
- We'll have to talk to Levenolz.
Was that supposed to be an interview?
- Right, Stockholm style!
- So what was missing?
Hey, you've sprouted a moustache.
What was herrelationship with her brother like?
And herparents?
And that Levenolz guy...
are they having a relationship?
This is a murder investigation, not "The Bold and the Beautiful".
Is she under protection?
She's the only member of her family left alive.
And the killer has a 36-hour head start...
I'll arrange it.
Right...
If you take the church, I'll go to the vicarage.
Hello...
I'm Jonny Blom, from the Violent Crimes Unit.
I'm here about the Schyttelius case.
Sten was one of the most devout and good-hearted men I ever knew.
Atrue Christian, in other words.
He had a rathertough situation.
His wife had bouts of depression, and he had to take care of everything.
Why was she depressed?
With a great husband like that?
I could never quite understand why.
- Excuse me, but who are you?
- DI Irene Huss, Violent Crimes Unit.
I'm Louise Maardh, I take care of the parish accounts.
You'd think the police would notify us before they came to snoop.
It's simply good manners.
- Any leads on those Satanists?
- No, it's still early days.
- So we're not narrowing it down yet.
- It's obviously those Satanists.
What makes you so sure?
If this isn't the work of the devil, I don't know what is...
Your boy's choir wouldn't happen to need more members, would it?
- Tell me about Rebecka.
- She's always been rather reserved.
How should I put this?
Evasive.
Last Christmas, she didn't even come to visit.
Sten said that she had the flu, but I don't know...
He didn't have an easy time of it, that's for sure.
- What's this?
- Villages forneedy orphans.
Sten and Jacob went there several times with funds and clothing and otheritems the church had collected.
Sten wanted to find the sinners that bumt down the chapel.
Is that what he did in here?
He could lock himself in here with the computer night after night.
He was tracking them down online.
He was making progress, too...
Which is more than you can say for the police.
Did he discuss his findings?
You should really talk to Eva Moller.
The parish organist.
She's into all that new-age hocus-pocus.
And she doesn't really act like a good Christian, if you ask me.
She has one of those devil signs on her car's gear shift knob.
Is there a pentagram on her car's gear shift?
Hi, I'm DI Irene Huss...
Sorry, but I dislike interrupting the flow...
Was that you, out by the ruins of the summer chapel yesterday?
If I had known you were a police offiicer, I wouldn't have taken off.
- What were you doing there?
- I was looking for answers.
Trying to find out who killed the Schyttelius family.
- At a bumt-down chapel?
- No, in the Cosmos.
And how did the Cosmos reply?
I don't know, you scared me off.
Why is there a pentagram on your gear shift?
- I have a lot of fire and air.
- What does that mean?
The pentagram is an earth tool, and it stands for stability.
- It keeps me grounded.
- I don't get it.
How can you believe in black magic and be a church organist?
I'd like to stress the fact that my pentagram is not inverted, and that in otherrespects, there is no conflict
- I love being a musician.
I love churches, and hallowed rooms...
But that doesn't mean that I can ignore the other forces around us.
I mean, without evil, goodness could not exist...
But I believe you've already come to the same conclusion.
- What do you mean?
- You have a very strong aura.
Bright colours.
That suggests that you are attuned to yourinner self.
You can see that?
You can't miss a strong aura like yours.
Why don't you give it a try?
Stand at a mirror with a light-coloured wall behind you.
And open your eyes...
But what were you up to the night before yesterday?
I was meditating.
Until 3 AM.
I always do that on the night of a full moon.
- Then I went home and went to bed.
- Then you don't have an alibi?
Sure I do.
The full moon... that's my alibi.
Mum, didn't you hear Dad?
What are you doing, anyway?
- Nothing.
Okay...
- Dinner's ready.
- Is he mowing the lawn again?
!
- No, he's trimming his hedge.
You'd think you'd be able to enjoy a meal on the patio in peace in quiet.
The man is insane.
Satan, Rebecka...
Satan!
- Satan, Rebecka...
Satan!
- Stop it!
He's coming to get you.
Satan will get you.
When Satan takes a person, it hurts.
- Good...
- Not now, I'm busy!
I have arranged police protection for Rebecka.
I'm planning to go to Stockholm, you see...
- There are so many questions...
- What's wrong with the telephone?
We can't afford any extravagant jaunts off to Stockholm.
- Extravagant?
- That's right.
Yourtrips to Denmark have put our budget in the red.
Are you listening to me?
There won't be any trips to Stockholm.
No trips to Stockholm!
Sign here, please.
- Thanks...
- You're welcome.
DI Huss, from Goteborg.
Hello.
Sorry, but Rebecka was admitted this morning.
- What's wrong?
- The incident uninged her.
Last night she broke down completely.
How long will she be there?
I'm no specialist, but a depression is hardly the same thing as a cold.
- Then I'll just have to talk to you.
- To me?
Why?
I can't imagine that I have much to contribute.
Christian Levenolz.
Is it true that you and Rebecka spent the night preceding July 4 together?
We were working, yes.
So you're not herboyfriend?
I don't see what that has to do with anything.
So you're not herboyfriend?
- Are you interrogating me?
- I'm just asking you a question.
Shouldrt you say that I have the right to have legal counsel present?
I can wait, if you feel the need to have a lawyer present.
And I'd love to have a cup of coffee while I'm waiting.
Black.
- How long has she been depressed?
- Since she heard the news.
That was only a few days ago.
Like you said, a depression isn't a cold.
Then I don't know...
Thank you.
Was that why she didn't spend Christmas with her family?
Come on, how long has she been depressed?
Since last autumn.
September or October...
- Do you know what triggered it?
- No, I don't have the vaguest idea.
What exactly do you do?
Computers and networks.
Right now we are working on security issues with regard to exponential and open networks.
- What were you doing last fall?
- That's confidential, I'm afraid.
- I really have to get to work...
- Did Rebecka mention any threats?
There was something in the papers about a Satanist connection.
That's only one of several leads.
Has Rebecka talked about Satanists?
Yes, she has...
When that chapel was bumt down, her father asked her to trace some people on the Intemet.
That's it...
- I really have to work.
- Of course.
By the way, do you have a number where I can reach Rebecka's doctor?
- She needs to rest.
- I'll be gentle.
Thanks.
Rebecka would like us to sit in here.
Is it true that yourfather asked you for help in tracing Satanists online?
Did you help your father?
- Please try to answer my question.
- He didn't get any help.
Why was that?
I realize that this is diffiicult, but I'd really like you to answer my question.
- Why didn't you want to help him?
- I...
- I couldn't.
- Why couldn't you help your father?
There, there...
You're almost done.
I only have one question left.
- Then I'll leave, I promise.
Listen, what was the nature of the assignment you and Christian performed last autumn, back in September and October?
Who were you working for?
Rebecka...
did it involve Satanism in any way?
- Scared...
- Who is scared, you?
- Scared!
- Of the Satanists?
- Have they made threats against you?
- Children...
- Children...
- What children?
Save...
Please...
- Are the children scared?
- Save...
I couldn't...
Save...
- She's had enough.
- Certainly.
- Why is she in such bad shape?
- Something happened at work.
What could that have been?
Levenolz claims that it's a confidential business matter, but when I asked Rebecka, she started talking about children...
- Children?
What children?
- I don't know.
Something about children, and either scared or save...
"Save the Children"?
Maybe...
Coffee?
We have lots of cookies, too.
Lisa Sandberg?
I called you earlier.
I'm DI Irene Huss.
Schyttelius and Levenolz.
- It will only take five minutes.
- That's what they all say.
- What do you want to know?
- The nature of their assignment.
Three years ago someone tipped me off about a paedophile network that was spreading child pornography online.
57 people were involved.
We lacked the know-how to discover their true identities.
That's where Schyttelius and Levenolz came in.
What exactly did their assignment involve?
They gained access to the ring without being discovered, and then they identified one member after the other.
Are any of the perpetrators still out there?
Unfortunately, yes.
13 of them, to be exact.
There are warrants out for them, but...
Did you get the feeling that Rebecka Schyttelius was...
How should I put this?
Well, affected by the material?
This was farworse than anything I'd ever seen before.
They were hunting down paedophiles.
"Save the Children" hired them to infiltrate a paedophile ring, and they gave me a list of the ones who have gone underground.
- There are women on this list...
- All in the name of equality.
So someone on this list might be trying to get back at Rebecka?
Does that really make sense, considering who was murdered?
It seems too far-fetched.
Unless both Sten and Rebecka were targeting the same individual.
Aperson whose identity they discovered.
I was thinking about Satanists.
They sacrifice children...
In the US, they do.
Children, virgins, lambs...
Well that's a twisted country.
Are you implying that this is some kind of a Satanist paedophile?
That's sick.
Well, now we have a list of names...
- People not even Interpol can find.
- Right.
Then maybe you...
Andersson.
I'm in a meeting.
Yes, she's here.
Hang on...
- It's Eva Moller.
- The organist.
Areal fox!
Switch on the speaker.
- Irene Huss speaking.
- Hi, this is Eva Moller.
I was just wondering if you've had the time to check out your aura yet.
- What do you want?
- When I was looking for answers...
Over at the chapel ruins, I wasrt completely straight with you.
I did see something before you got there.
I saw Sten, cloaked in darkness.
In darkness?
What kind of darkness?
I'm sure we could find out, ourenergies are so strong.
- I don't think I understand...
- Yes, you do.
Call me, if you're interested.
Who was that?
What do we know about her?
- There's a pentagram in her car.
- And she believes in the other side.
I ran a check.
She doesn't have a criminal record or anything like that.
- There isn't much record ofher.
- Maybe she's changed heridentity.
And her old name is on that list.
Sorry.
I was only trying to be funny.
She has no alibi for that night, orfor the "Purple Pastor" murder.
- Was she with the full moon then too?
- They both occurred on a full moon.
- What?
You think I should go?
- Yes, go ahead!
Then I want Jonny to go with you, it might be a trap.
And stay in the background.
She lives out in the middle of nowhere.
- Are you sure this is the right road?
- Yes.
I don't want the foxy organist to see me, so pull over.
And I'll get out.
I see that you're fascinated by that knob...
Would you like to borrow it?
You'll see that it isn't as evil and dangerous as you think.
Maybe it would even help you loosen up.
We're going to stay outdoors.
This is my real pentagram.
You tum the glass a bit and a little glass devil comes into view.
Can you see it?
That's only Missan, she's a real sweetheart.
But she doesn't seem to like you, though.
Listen...
I guess you think this is strange and nutty, but it's pure magic.
Don't be so uptight...
The first thing we're going to do is create a hallowed space.
Once we enter the ring, and have sanctified the space, we are not, under any circumstances, to leave the space before we have completed the process.
- Listen, I was wondering...
- Not until we're done.
And switch off your phone.
Disturbances...
in the cosmic atmosphere.
That's the last thing we want.
This is our altar.
This is my wand.
It represents fire passion and sexuality.
The providence of the sun.
This is my "athme", it's an ain'tool.
It directs and moves energy.
You've seen the glass devil already.
It increases spirituality.
Makes the trance deeper.
Welcome into the sacred space.
Primeval mother, I call upon you.
By way of the four elements and the their cardinal points, blessed be your name...
We bid you welcome into our sacred space.
Primeval mother, I call upon you.
Sator, Arepo, Tenet, Opera, Rotas.
Eva?
Eva?
Eva, what happened?
Wake up.
What happened?
Satan...
I saw Satan himself.
Satan himself!
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know...
- Mum?
- Hi.
- You aren't going to believe this.
- Honey, please, could I at least...?
- Sammie killed Felix.
- What did you just say?
- Sammie killed Felix the terror.
- Our neighbour's cat?
- We were out walking and...
- Hang on!
- Was Sammie on a leash?
- Of course.
He was calm.
Then suddenly he dived into our lilac bush, and Felix was there.
He like just shook it a little, and in two seconds it was dead.
Gross!
- Where were the Nilssons?
- Mr Nilsson was a few feet away.
When he realized what had happened, he started to chase us with his broom.
Saying that he was going to kill Sammie, and stufflike that.
- He chased you with a broom?
- Yeah, and we locked ourselves in.
He stood out front for a while, glaring and banging on the windows.
I tried to call you, but you didn't pick up.
- You're going to pay for this...
- Shut yourmouth!
I realize that you're upset, but I can't really see that it's our fault.
What an interesting thing for a police officer to say.
- Whose fault is it, then?
- Yours.
- How on earth could it be our fault?
- We keep Sammie on a leash.
Your cat roams all over the place.
I'll have you know that your cat was on ourproperty.
If your cat doesn't have more sense, it has only itself to blame!
Do you know what I find even more serious?
That you chased my daughter and threatened herwith a broom!
That's ridiculous!
And the same thing goes foryourpathetic little lawn.
Have I made myself clear?
- Sammie killed that awful cat.
- What?
Really?
And they chased me with a broom, so Mum just told them off.
- I've never seen her that angry.
- Did Sammie bite their cat to death?
- No more shredded clothes...
- Shit, it's all my fault.
- What do you mean, your fault?
- I wished that cat would die.
Oh, honey...
That doesn't make it your fault.
I've wished that cat would drop dead, and the Nilssons too for that matter.
But I did that thing in one of those books...
I did something I read about in a book you brought home...
"The Black Book of Satan"?
Cool!
Is there something in it about how to get a record deal...?
Don't ever do this again!
Do you hear me?
And that goes for you, too!
You were just fooling around...
Then the guy slammed the door in my face.
What's so funny?
- I think it's fabulous.
- Fabulous?
They had it coming.
They've terrorized us for 14 years now, and we've never said a word.
You told them exactly what they needed to hear at last.
I feel like taking a long run today.
Give me a kiss.
You have reached Anderssors voice mail.
Leave a message.
Irene here.
Call me as soon as you can!
Put her in place.
Hail, Lucifer!
Get her!
Go on!
It's only a damn girl!
- Back off!
Back off, I'm a cop!
- Bullshit, she's lying.
Get her!
Go on!
Come on, get her!
- Hi, it's me.
- Hi, honey.
- I've been trying to reach you.
- I was taking a shower.
- Did anything happen yesterday?
- No, I went past the station and...
- I get worried, so you can't...
- We can talk more tonight.
- All right.
Love you.
- Love you, too.
I finally managed to get hold of Kristina Schyttelius, Jacob's ex-wife.
- How did she react?
- Not at all.
- Why did they get a divorce?
- Jacob didn't want to have children.
Aschool teacher involved in drives for the needy...
He didn't want children ofhis own.
- Where have you been?
- Sorry I'm late...
I tried to get back to you yesterday.
- It wasrt important.
- The others tried to call you, too.
I guess she's been out partying, then.
Is there any coffee?
Holy shit...
- It's those Satanists.
- Let me have a look...
- Where did that come from?
- There's no return address.
- Where's this?
- They must have a new hangout.
Look, there's someone on the altar.
- It's a woman.
- How can you tell?
It could be a boy.
- No, there's a breast...
- What bastards!
It's some East Bloc whore.
Too bad they're in the way.
Excuse me...
- What's wrong with her?
- Anxiety?
Listen, could you compile a list of missing women?
Irene?
Are you all right?
I'm not feeling very well.
- Is there anything wrong?
- No, I'll be out in a minute...
I couldn't find any traces of semen.
- So they haven't... been there?
- Not that I can detect right now.
But I would only be able to see that if there were any tears caused by recent penetration.
- If you would like a more thorough...
- No, thank you.
No women are reported missing.
- Did you check all over Sweden?
- Just this county.
Check the rest of the country as well.
And then move on to Interpol.
I've going to run images of the victim through an enancement programme.
- Find anything interesting?
- Yes, like to have a look?
Come on, help me roll in the TV.
There...
- What are they doing?
- Hang on...
- Run the damn programme already.
- That's what I'm doing.
- Looks like they wrote a message.
- What message?
I can't really see, but it looks like "heil", or something...
So now what?
That woman has a problem...
Cleaning Supplies
Lift it a little...
I don't believe in the Satanist lead.
- Of course those bastards are guilty.
- I bet they've done plenty.
- But not the Schyttelius murders.
- And how do you know that?
Because on that particular occasion they were busy doing this.
Let me have a look.
It makes you want to dash home for a pair ofhorns.
You see, when Satanists kill, they do it in a ritual manner, as part of a sacrificial ceremony.
Take the purple Pastor, he was killed in a ritual fashion.
And a pentagram was carved into his skin.
But the Schyttelius' were shot and the pentagrams were just daubed on.
So the Satanist thing is simply a smokescreen?
Yes...
- What other leads do we have?
- None.
I still think that Rebecka is the key.
- Rebecka?
Why?
- Their Save the Children gig...
Hang on...
Hello, this is DI Huss,
We recently spoke about the work Schyttelius and Levenolz did foryou.
There was something I forgot to ask.
- The ring had 57 members.
- That's right.
- Did they identify all 57?
- All but two.
They called themselves "Peter and Pan".
- Are they connected in some way?
- That's what we thought.
But Levenolz said was no connection.
- What did Schyttelius say?
- I don't know.
We were mostly in contact with Levenolz by the end.
So you didn't talk to Schyttelius?
That's right.
It was a bit strange.
We tried to get in touch with her...
- But you couldn't?
- Levenolz wouldn't let us.
Did you want to discuss Peter and Pan with her?
Yes, I did.
How did you know that?
You've been very helpful.
Thank you.
All right, I know what the motive was.
And it has nothing to do with Satanists.
- No...
So what's the motive?
- Children.
- The sexual abuse of children.
- Havert we already been there?
Children keep coming up.
Jacob wouldn't have kids with his wife.
- Why didn't he want to have kids?
- I can think of a 100 good reasons...
And then there's those African childrers villages...
"The children are eagerto learn and gratefully accept the wisdom of God."
Then there's the Save the Children project:
Apaedophile network.
- Sten and Jacob were paedophiles?
- I'm not 100% sure.
But I believe that Rebecka discovered that they belonged to the ring.
- She could have exposed them...
- But chose to kill them instead?
No one knows the territory as well.
Where they kept their computers...
She could easily lead us astray.
- Why would she shoot her mother?
- I don't know.
Maybe Elsa saw the murders...
Or maybe she was a paedophile, too.
Fredrik...
Have you been able to log in on Sters computer?
Well, it uses very advanced encryption...
- It's out of my league, actually.
- Really?
You need a password, so I designed a programme to help figure it out...
- All right if I have a go?
- Believe me, I've tried everything.
From "priestie boy" to "hcruhc"...
That's "church" spelt backwards.
- Don't touch!
- Is this Sters computer?
- I hooked it up to my computer...
- The department computer.
- It generates passwords...
- How long will that take?
- Anywhere between a few seconds...
- To years.
- Or you can try "Peter Pan".
- "Peter Pan"?
- Nix.
- "Peterpan", one word.
Holy shit...
We're in.
Here's something.
- She's the one, right?
- Yes, absolutely.
Just think, Jacob...
What a gift.
A child...
Thank you, Lord, forthis gift.
"The children are eagerto learn and gratefully accept the wisdom of God."
Those god damn bastards!
Turn off that depressing crap!
You and Fredrik are going to Stockholm to interrogate Rebecka.
If that's not possible, bring herin.
Rebecka's not really in shape for an interrogation...
I'll be as gentle as I can.
Hello, Rebecka.
Do you remember me?
Irene Huss.
I'm investigating the murder of your family.
I talked to Lisa Sandberg, from "Save the Children", and she told me what a terrific job you did.
Lisa also told me there were a few people you couldn't identify.
I'm thinking of "Peter" and "Pan".
Couldrt you establish theiridentities?
No...
Are you quite sure of that?
- No...
- No, you aren't sure?
Or that you couldn't establish theiridentities?
So you didn't find out who they were?
I believe you did, you see.
If not, I can tell you now that Peter and Pan are your father and your brother.
It's my fault...
- It's all my fault!
- I think she's had enough.
Yourfather and your brother are accountable fortheir own actions.
It's not your fault, but if you took the law in your own hands...
It's all my fault!
What the hell are you doing?
I understand that you find this upsetting...
You should be ashamed of yourselves.
You should be bloody ashamed!
Yes, but...
Is it so damn hard to just leave her alone?
Or are you trying to kill her?
You fucking monsters!
- Are we pushing her too hard?
- "We"?
But that Levenolz guy has got to know more than he's telling us.
Speak of the devil...
Levenolz wants me to come around to his offiice.
That means you can see Rebecka.
- All by myself?
- You can handle it.
Hello?
Hi.
Listen, she's not here.
- I don't think she did it.
- Why is that?
I think it's Christian.
I found airline tickets, some maps and a drawing showing the layout of the vicarage.
- It could still be her.
- No, she grew up there.
She would know herway around her own home, where the study is and...
- Hello?
- Hang on...
I'll call you back later.
- Irene Huss.
- It's Christian Levenolz.
Don't bothertrying to find Rebecka.
- Did you take her with you?
- She's in a safe place now.
- Where are you?
- Where you'll neverfind us.
Now go over to the computerthat's running.
I'm going to tell you what actually happened.
It's unfortunate...
There is no way there can be a happy ending.
- Just tell me where you are...
- Please...
Shut up.
Maybe once in a lifetime you can be lucky enough to meet someone whose heart beats in time with yourown.
And you know it's forever.
Rebecka is that person forme.
- It's all my fault.
I never should have told you, it's all my fault.
No, Rebecka, it's not your fault.
Just tell me where you are...
Let me take care of this.
- Honey, everything will be fine.
As you know, we did some work for"Save the Children".
I didn't notice anything at first...
But then I saw how Rebecka's mental health was deteriorating.
Aftera while she was unable to work.
She couldn't get out of bed...
You have to submit material to be accepted into a ring like that...
And one of the members we didn't reveal the identity of an individual who called himself "Peter", submitted this.
The girl in the film is Rebecka.
And the man molesting her is herown father, Sten Schyttelius.
Her brotherJacob is holding the camera.
Don't scream.
We don't want to disturb Mummy, now do we?
Rebecka is eight years old here, and herbrother is 14.
Both of them molested her regularly from time she was five.
- What did I say?
- That I mustrt scream.
Because then you know who will come, don't you?
Satan, Rebecka.
And you don't want Satan to come, because when Satan takes you, it hurts for real.
By the time she was 11, herfather lost interest in her.
Unfortunately, her brotherdidn't.
Rebecka was forced to shut up and take it.
Put that rifle away, Christian.
Let's talk about it instead.
Christian, there is help available out there...
There is nothing that can help this situation.
Not anymore.
When I realized that Rebecka would neverbe well again...
That's when I decided to kill them.
They destroyed her life.
They deserved to die several times over.
But I didn't intend things to end this way.
We have decided to do this, there is no future forus.
This is the end of the line.
Rebecka...
Come with me.
Hello...
There's something I haven't had time to tell you...
Well, "had time" isn't...
I guess I didn't...
That sacrificial ceremony...
- I know where it took place.
- You do?
How do you know that?
The woman in those pictures is me.
Hi.
Take a look at this.
Come here.
Jacob Schyttelius, 42 years old.
No children.
Been divorced for two years.
Elementary school teacher.
Next of kin:
His sister, Rebecka, a computer consultant in Stockholm, and their parents, Sten and Elsa, who live at the vicarage next door.
Hello?
Anyone home?
Irene?
Sten, Elsa and Jacob Schyttelius were murdered last night.
Shot at close range with a rifle.
Practically executed.
What do we know about the daughter, Rebecka Schyttelius?
The police up in Stockholm are going to interview her later on today.
Shouldn't we talk to her, Andersson?
It's our case, after all.
- That's what I said...
- I could stream the interview.
- "Steam"?
- That's "stream", you see it online.
- What about these star things?
- The blood's from our vics.
- But what's their significance?
- How nice of you to ask...
A pentagram is not necessarily a symbol of evil, but if you invert it, it becomes charged with magic.
An image of the devil emerges.
- A common Satanist symbol.
- What is this, "The Da Vinci Code"?
- We found these at Jacob's place.
- They've been targeted before.
Anyone remember the "Purple Pastor"?
- What was the "Purple Pastor"?
- A case, 7 or 8 years back.
We never did crack the case, but the evidence suggested Satanists.
The victim, another vicar, was wrapped in a purple cape, and he was stabbed in the back seven times.
All seven wounds were made by different people using the same knife.
Some were shallow, while others had been made with great force.
And here's the knife.
This photo was taken five years ago, by a surveillance camera over at Haga Church.
It was taken when a crucifix was stolen.
We don't know who the man is.
Possibly the leader of the Satanist cult.
So what's the connection to the Schyttelius family?
The "Purple Pastor" was found in a chapel that belongs to Schyttelius' parish.
The cult held their meetings there.
- We should check out that chapel.
- That might be difficult..
You see, it burnt down five years ago.
Hey!
Would that be Jacob's and Ster's computers you have there?
- Find anything interesting?
- Jacob's was wiped clean.
But Sters was still processing when I got to it.
- Could you make it stop?
- All you have to do is unplug it.
- What the hell's on it, then?
- Well, I can't seem to gain access.
- I need a password or something.
- "Amen."
- What?
- Or "hallelujah".
Well, hello there, little fellow...
Come to Mummy...
Mum, look!
Just look at what that awful creature's done!
- Our awful neighbours' awful cat!
- What's going on?
I hung this out to dry, and I found it in the bushes, all tom up and dirty!
And if you don't do something about it, I will!
Katarina, please...
Come on, sweetie...
What am I supposed to do, Sammie?
Teenagers!
No...
No, Sammie.
Heel.
Heel, Sammie.
Did your parents and your brother have any enemies you knew of?
- What about you, any threats?
- No.
- Please describe your relationship.
- What do you mean?
Did you see and call each other regularly?
- Where were you last night?
- At the office, working.
- Alone?
- No, I was with my associate.
- Christian Levenolz.
- And you both worked all night?
If you think of anything, please get in touch with us.
- Right...
- We'll have to talk to Levenolz.
Was that supposed to be an interview?
- Right, Stockholm style!
- So what was missing?
Hey, you've sprouted a moustache.
What was her relationship with her brother like?
And her parents?
And that Levenolz guy...
are they having a relationship?
This is a murder investigation, not "The Bold and the Beautiful".
Is she under protection?
She's the only member of her family left alive.
And the killer has a 36-hour head start...
I'll arrange it.
Right...
If you take the church, I'll go to the vicarage.
Hello...
I'm Jonny Blom, from the Violent Crimes Unit.
I'm here about the Schyttelius case.
Sten was one of the most devout and good-hearted men I ever knew.
A true Christian, in other words.
He had a rather tough situation.
His wife had bouts of depression, and he had to take care of everything.
Why was she depressed?
With a great husband like that?
I could never quite understand why.
- Excuse me, but who are you?
- DI Irene Huss, Violent Crimes Unit.
I'm Louise Maardh, I take care of the parish accounts.
You'd think the police would notify us before they came to snoop.
It's simply good manners.
- Any leads on those Satanists?
- No, it's still early days.
- So we're not narrowing it down yet.
- It's obviously those Satanists.
What makes you so sure?
If this isn't the work of the devil, I don't know what is...
Your boy's choir wouldn't happen to need more members, would it?
- Tell me about Rebecka.
- She's always been rather reserved.
How should I put this?
Evasive.
Last Christmas, she didn't even come to visit.
Sten said that she had the flu, but I don't know...
He didn't have an easy time of it, that's for sure.
- What's this?
- Villages for needy orphans.
Sten and Jacob went there several times with funds and clothing and other items the church had collected.
Sten wanted to find the sinners that burnt down the chapel.
Is that what he did in here?
He could lock himself in here with the computer night after night.
He was tracking them down online.
He was making progress, too...
Which is more than you can say for the police.
Did he discuss his findings?
You should really talk to Eva Moller.
The parish organist.
She's into all that new-age hocus-pocus.
And she doesn't really act like a good Christian, if you ask me.
She has one of those devil signs on her car's gear shift knob.
Is there a pentagram on her car's gear shift?
Hi, I'm DI Irene Huss...
Sorry, but I dislike interrupting the flow...
Was that you, out by the ruins of the summer chapel yesterday?
If I had known you were a police officer, I wouldn't have taken off.
- What were you doing there?
- I was looking for answers.
Trying to find out who killed the Schyttelius family.
- At a burnt-down chapel?
- No, in the Cosmos.
And how did the Cosmos reply?
I don't know, you scared me off.
Why is there a pentagram on your gear shift?
- I have a lot of fire and air.
- What does that mean?
The pentagram is an earth tool, and it stands for stability.
- It keeps me grounded.
- I don't get it.
How can you believe in black magic and be a church organist?
I'd like to stress the fact that my pentagram is not inverted, and that in other respects, there is no conflict
- I love being a musician.
I love churches, and hallowed rooms...
But that doesn't mean that I can ignore the other forces around us.
I mean, without evil, goodness could not exist...
But I believe you've already come to the same conclusion.
- What do you mean?
- You have a very strong aura.
Bright colours.
That suggests that you are attuned to your inner self.
You can see that?
You can't miss a strong aura like yours.
Why don't you give it a try?
Stand at a mirror with a light-coloured wall behind you.
And open your eyes...
But what were you up to the night before yesterday?
I was meditating.
Until 3 AM.
I always do that on the night of a full moon.
- Then I went home and went to bed.
- Then you don't have an alibi?
Sure I do.
The full moon... that's my alibi.
Mum, didn't you hear Dad?
What are you doing, anyway?
- Nothing.
Okay...
- Dinner's ready.
- Is he mowing the lawn again?
!
- No, he's trimming his hedge.
You'd think you'd be able to enjoy a meal on the patio in peace in quiet.
The man is insane.
Satan, Rebecka...
Satan!
- Satan, Rebecka...
Satan!
- Stop it!
He's coming to get you.
Satan will get you.
When Satan takes a person, it hurts.
- Good...
- Not now, I'm busy!
I have arranged police protection for Rebecka.
I'm planning to go to Stockholm, you see...
- There are so many questions...
- What's wrong with the telephone?
We can't afford any extravagant jaunts off to Stockholm.
- Extravagant?
- That's right.
Your trips to Denmark have put our budget in the red.
Are you listening to me?
There won't be any trips to Stockholm.
No trips to Stockholm!
Sign here, please.
- Thanks...
- You're welcome.
DI Huss, from Goteborg.
Hello.
Sorry, but Rebecka was admitted this morning.
- What's wrong?
- The incident unhinged her.
Last night she broke down completely.
How long will she be there?
I'm no specialist, but a depression is hardly the same thing as a cold.
- Then I'll just have to talk to you.
- To me?
Why?
I can't imagine that I have much to contribute.
Christian Levenolz.
Is it true that you and Rebecka spent the night preceding July 4 together?
We were working, yes.
So you're not her boyfriend?
I don't see what that has to do with anything.
So you're not her boyfriend?
- Are you interrogating me?
- I'm just asking you a question.
Shouldn't you say that I have the right to have legal counsel present?
I can wait, if you feel the need to have a lawyer present.
And I'd love to have a cup of coffee while I'm waiting.
Black.
- How long has she been depressed?
- Since she heard the news.
That was only a few days ago.
Like you said, a depression isn't a cold.
Then I don't know...
Thank you.
Was that why she didn't spend Christmas with her family?
Come on, how long has she been depressed?
Since last autumn.
September or October...
- Do you know what triggered it?
- No, I don't have the vaguest idea.
What exactly do you do?
Computers and networks.
Right now we are working on security issues with regard to exponential and open networks.
- What were you doing last fall?
- That's confidential, I'm afraid.
- I really have to get to work...
- Did Rebecka mention any threats?
There was something in the papers about a Satanist connection.
That's only one of several leads.
Has Rebecka talked about Satanists?
Yes, she has...
When that chapel was burnt down, her father asked her to trace some people on the Internet
That's it...
- I really have to work.
- Of course.
By the way, do you have a number where I can reach Rebecka's doctor?
- She needs to rest.
- I'll be gentle.
Thanks.
Rebecka would like us to sit in here.
Is it true that your father asked you for help in tracing Satanists online?
Did you help your father?
- Please try to answer my question.
- He didn't get any help.
Why was that?
I realize that this is difficult, but I'd really like you to answer my question.
- Why didn't you want to help him?
- I...
- I couldn't.
- Why couldn't you help your father?
There, there...
You're almost done.
I only have one question left.
- Then I'll leave, I promise.
Listen, what was the nature of the assignment you and Christian performed last autumn, back in September and October?
Who were you working for?
Rebecka...
did it involve Satanism in any way?
- Scared...
- Who is scared, you?
- Scared!
- Of the Satanists?
- Have they made threats against you?
- Children...
- Children...
- What children?
Save...
Please...
- Are the children scared?
- Save...
I couldn't...
Save...
- She's had enough.
- Certainly.
- Why is she in such bad shape?
- Something happened at work.
What could that have been?
Levenolz claims that it's a confidential business matter, but when I asked Rebecka, she started talking about children...
- Children?
What children?
- I don't know.
Something about children, and either scared or save...
"Save the Children"?
Maybe...
Coffee?
We have lots of cookies, too.
Lisa Sandberg?
I called you earlier.
I'm DI Irene Huss.
Schyttelius and Levenolz.
- It will only take five minutes.
- That's what they all say.
- What do you want to know?
- The nature of their assignment.
Three years ago someone tipped me off about a paedophile network that was spreading child pornography online.
57 people were involved.
We lacked the know-how to discover their true identities.
That's where Schyttelius and Levenolz came in.
What exactly did their assignment involve?
They gained access to the ring without being discovered, and then they identified one member after the other.
Are any of the perpetrators still out there?
Unfortunately, yes.
13 of them, to be exact.
There are warrants out for them, but...
Did you get the feeling that Rebecka Schyttelius was...
How should I put this?
Well, affected by the material?
This was far worse than anything I'd ever seen before.
They were hunting down paedophiles.
"Save the Children" hired them to infiltrate a paedophile ring, and they gave me a list of the ones who have gone underground.
- There are women on this list...
- All in the name of equality.
So someone on this list might be trying to get back at Rebecka?
Does that really make sense, considering who was murdered?
It seems too far-fetched.
Unless both Sten and Rebecka were targeting the same individual.
A person whose identity they discovered.
I was thinking about Satanists.
They sacrifice children...
In the US, they do.
Children, virgins, lambs...
Well that's a twisted country.
Are you implying that this is some kind of a Satanist paedophile?
That's sick.
Well, now we have a list of names...
- People not even Interpol can find.
- Right.
Then maybe you...
Andersson.
I'm in a meeting.
Yes, she's here.
Hang on...
- It's Eva Moller.
- The organist.
Areal fox!
Switch on the speaker.
- Irene Huss speaking.
- Hi, this is Eva Moller.
I was just wondering if you've had the time to check out your aura yet.
- What do you want?
- When I was looking for answers...
Over at the chapel ruins, I wasn't completely straight with you.
I did see something before you got there.
I saw Sten, cloaked in darkness.
In darkness?
What kind of darkness?
I'm sure we could find out, our energies are so strong.
- I don't think I understand...
- Yes, you do.
Call me, if you're interested.
Who was that?
What do we know about her?
- There's a pentagram in her car.
- And she believes in the other side.
I ran a check.
She doesn't have a criminal record or anything like that.
- There isn't much record of her
- Maybe she's changed her identity.
And her old name is on that list.
Sorry.
I was only trying to be funny.
She has no alibi for that night, or for the "Purple Pastor" murder.
- Was she with the full moon then too?
- They both occurred on a full moon.
- What?
You think I should go?
- Yes, go ahead!
Then I want Jonny to go with you, it might be a trap.
And stay in the background.
She lives out in the middle of nowhere.
- Are you sure this is the right road?
- Yes.
I don't want the foxy organist to see me, so pull over.
And I'll get out.
I see that you're fascinated by that knob...
Would you like to borrow it?
You'll see that it isn't as evil and dangerous as you think.
Maybe it would even help you loosen up.
We're going to stay outdoors.
This is my real pentagram.
You tum the glass a bit and a little glass devil comes into view.
Can you see it?
That's only Missan, she's a real sweetheart.
But she doesn't seem to like you, though.
Listen...
I guess you think this is strange and nutty, but it's pure magic.
Don't be so uptight...
The first thing we're going to do is create a hallowed space.
Once we enter the ring, and have sanctified the space, we are not, under any circumstances, to leave the space before we have completed the process.
- Listen, I was wondering...
- Not until we're done.
And switch off your phone.
Disturbances...
in the cosmic atmosphere.
That's the last thing we want.
This is our altar.
This is my wand.
It represents fire passion and sexuality.
The providence of the sun.
This is my "athme", it's an ain'tool.
It directs and moves energy.
You've seen the glass devil already.
It increases spirituality.
Makes the trance deeper.
Welcome into the sacred space.
Primeval mother, I call upon you.
By way of the four elements and the their cardinal points, blessed be your name...
We bid you welcome into our sacred space.
Primeval mother, I call upon you.
Sator, Arepo, Tenet, Opera, Rotas.
Eva?
Eva?
Eva, what happened?
Wake up.
What happened?
Satan...
I saw Satan himself.
Satan himself!
- What the hell was that?
- I don't know...
- Mum?
- Hi.
- You aren't going to believe this.
- Honey, please, could I at least...?
- Sammie killed Felix.
- What did you just say?
- Sammie killed Felix the terror.
- Our neighbour's cat?
- We were out walking and...
- Hang on!
- Was Sammie on a leash?
- Of course.
He was calm.
Then suddenly he dived into our lilac bush, and Felix was there.
He like just shook it a little, and in two seconds it was dead.
Gross!
- Where were the Nilssons?
- Mr Nilsson was a few feet away.
When he realized what had happened, he started to chase us with his broom.
Saying that he was going to kill Sammie, and stuff like that.
- He chased you with a broom?
- Yeah, and we locked ourselves in.
He stood out front for a while, glaring and banging on the windows.
I tried to call you, but you didn't pick up.
- You're going to pay for this...
- Shut your mouth!
I realize that you're upset, but I can't really see that it's our fault.
What an interesting thing for a police officer to say.
- Whose fault is it, then?
- Yours.
- How on earth could it be our fault?
- We keep Sammie on a leash.
Your cat roams all over the place.
I'll have you know that your cat was on our property
If your cat doesn't have more sense, it has only itself to blame!
Do you know what I find even more serious?
That you chased my daughter and threatened her with a broom!
That's ridiculous!
And the same thing goes for your pathetic little lawn.
Have I made myself clear?
- Sammie killed that awful cat.
- What?
Really?
And they chased me with a broom, so Mum just told them off.
- I've never seen her that angry.
- Did Sammie bite their cat to death?
- No more shredded clothes...
- Shit, it's all my fault.
- What do you mean, your fault?
- I wished that cat would die.
Oh, honey...
That doesn't make it your fault.
I've wished that cat would drop dead, and the Nilssons too for that matter.
But I did that thing in one of those books...
I did something I read about in a book you brought home...
"The Black Book of Satan"?
Cool!
Is there something in it about how to get a record deal...?
Don't ever do this again!
Do you hear me?
And that goes for you, too!
You were just fooling around...
Then the guy slammed the door in my face.
What's so funny?
- I think it's fabulous.
- Fabulous?
They had it coming.
They've terrorized us for 14 years now, and we've never said a word.
You told them exactly what they needed to hear at last.
I feel like taking a long run today.
Give me a kiss.
You have reached Anderssons voice mail.
Leave a message.
Irene here.
Call me as soon as you can!
Put her in place.
Hail, Lucifer!
Get her!
Go on!
It's only a damn girl!
- Back off!
Back off, I'm a cop!
- Bullshit, she's lying.
Get her!
Go on!
Come on, get her!
- Hi, it's me.
- Hi, honey.
- I've been trying to reach you.
- I was taking a shower.
- Did anything happen yesterday?
- No, I went past the station and...
- I get worried, so you can't...
- We can talk more tonight.
- All right.
Love you.
- Love you, too.
I finally managed to get hold of Kristina Schyttelius, Jacob's ex-wife.
- How did she react?
- Not at all.
- Why did they get a divorce?
- Jacob didn't want to have children.
A school teacher involved in drives for the needy...
He didn't want children of his own.
- Where have you been?
- Sorry I'm late...
I tried to get back to you yesterday.
- It wasn't important.
- The others tried to call you, too.
I guess she's been out partying, then.
Is there any coffee?
Holy shit...
- It's those Satanists.
- Let me have a look...
- Where did that come from?
- There's no return address.
- Where's this?
- They must have a new hangout.
Look, there's someone on the altar.
- It's a woman.
- How can you tell?
It could be a boy.
- No, there's a breast...
- What bastards!
It's some East Bloc whore.
Too bad they're in the way.
Excuse me...
- What's wrong with her?
- Anxiety?
Listen, could you compile a list of missing women?
Irene?
Are you all right?
I'm not feeling very well.
- Is there anything wrong?
- No, I'll be out in a minute...
I couldn't find any traces of semen.
- So they haven't... been there?
- Not that I can detect right now.
But I would only be able to see that if there were any tears caused by recent penetration.
- If you would like a more thorough...
- No, thank you.
No women are reported missing.
- Did you check all over Sweden?
- Just this county.
Check the rest of the country as well.
And then move on to Interpol.
I've going to run images of the victim through an enhancement programme.
- Find anything interesting?
- Yes, like to have a look?
Come on, help me roll in the TV.
There...
- What are they doing?
- Hang on...
- Run the damn programme already.
- That's what I'm doing.
- Looks like they wrote a message.
- What message?
I can't really see, but it looks like "heil", or something...
So now what?
That woman has a problem...
Cleaning Supplies
Lift it a little...
I don't believe in the Satanist lead.
- Of course those bastards are guilty.
- I bet they've done plenty.
- But not the Schyttelius murders.
- And how do you know that?
Because on that particular occasion they were busy doing this.
Let me have a look.
It makes you want to dash home for a pair of horns.
You see, when Satanists kill, they do it in a ritual manner, as part of a sacrificial ceremony.
Take the purple Pastor, he was killed in a ritual fashion.
And a pentagram was carved into his skin.
But the Schyttelius' were shot and the pentagrams were just daubed on.
So the Satanist thing is simply a smokescreen?
Yes...
- What other leads do we have?
- None.
I still think that Rebecka is the key.
- Rebecka?
Why?
- Their Save the Children gig...
Hang on...
Hello, this is DI Huss,
We recently spoke about the work Schyttelius and Levenolz did for you
There was something I forgot to ask.
- The ring had 57 members.
- That's right.
- Did they identify all 57?
- All but two.
They called themselves "Peter and Pan".
- Are they connected in some way?
- That's what we thought.
But Levenolz said was no connection.
- What did Schyttelius say?
- I don't know.
We were mostly in contact with Levenolz by the end.
So you didn't talk to Schyttelius?
That's right.
It was a bit strange.
We tried to get in touch with her...
- But you couldn't?
- Levenolz wouldn't let us.
Did you want to discuss Peter and Pan with her?
Yes, I did.
How did you know that?
You've been very helpful.
Thank you.
All right, I know what the motive was.
And it has nothing to do with Satanists.
- No...
So what's the motive?
- Children.
- The sexual abuse of children.
- Haven't we already been there?
Children keep coming up.
Jacob wouldn't have kids with his wife.
- Why didn't he want to have kids?
- I can think of a 100 good reasons...
And then there's those African children's villages...
"The children are eager to learn and gratefully accept the wisdom of God."
Then there's the Save the Children project:
A paedophile network.
- Sten and Jacob were paedophiles?
- I'm not 100% sure.
But I believe that Rebecka discovered that they belonged to the ring.
- She could have exposed them...
- But chose to kill them instead?
No one knows the territory as well.
Where they kept their computers...
She could easily lead us astray.
- Why would she shoot her mother?
- I don't know.
Maybe Elsa saw the murders...
Or maybe she was a paedophile, too.
Fredrik...
Have you been able to log in on Sters computer?
Well, it uses very advanced encryption...
- It's out of my league, actually.
- Really?
You need a password, so I designed a programme to help figure it out...
- All right if I have a go?
- Believe me, I've tried everything.
From "priestie boy" to "hcruhc"...
That's "church" spelt backwards.
- Don't touch!
- Is this Sters computer?
- I hooked it up to my computer...
- The department computer.
- It generates passwords...
- How long will that take?
- Anywhere between a few seconds...
- To years.
- Or you can try "Peter Pan".
- "Peter Pan"?
- Nix.
- "Peterpan", one word.
Holy shit...
We're in.
Here's something.
- She's the one, right?
- Yes, absolutely.
Just think, Jacob...
What a gift.
A child...
Thank you, Lord, for this gift.
"The children are eager to learn and gratefully accept the wisdom of God."
Those god damn bastards!
Turn off that depressing crap!
You and Fredrik are going to Stockholm to interrogate Rebecka.
If that's not possible, bring her in
Rebecka's not really in shape for an interrogation...
I'll be as gentle as I can.
Hello, Rebecka.
Do you remember me?
Irene Huss.
I'm investigating the murder of your family.
I talked to Lisa Sandberg, from "Save the Children", and she told me what a terrific job you did.
Lisa also told me there were a few people you couldn't identify.
I'm thinking of "Peter" and "Pan".
Couldn't you establish their identities?
No...
Are you quite sure of that?
- No...
- No, you aren't sure?
Or that you couldn't establish their identities?
So you didn't find out who they were?
I believe you did, you see.
If not, I can tell you now that Peter and Pan are your father and your brother.
It's my fault...
- It's all my fault!
- I think she's had enough.
Your father and your brother are accountable for their own actions.
It's not your fault, but if you took the law in your own hands...
It's all my fault!
What the hell are you doing?
I understand that you find this upsetting...
You should be ashamed of yourselves.
You should be bloody ashamed!
Yes, but...
Is it so damn hard to just leave her alone?
Or are you trying to kill her?
You fucking monsters!
- Are we pushing her too hard?
- "We"?
But that Levenolz guy has got to know more than he's telling us.
Speak of the devil...
Levenolz wants me to come around to his office
That means you can see Rebecka.
- All by myself?
- You can handle it.
Hello?
Hi.
Listen, she's not here.
- I don't think she did it.
- Why is that?
I think it's Christian.
I found airline tickets, some maps and a drawing showing the layout of the vicarage.
- It could still be her.
- No, she grew up there.
She would know her way around her own home, where the study is and...
- Hello?
- Hang on...
I'll call you back later.
- Irene Huss.
- It's Christian Levenolz.
Don't bother trying to find Rebecka.
- Did you take her with you?
- She's in a safe place now.
- Where are you?
- Where you'll never find us.
Now go over to the computer that's running.
I'm going to tell you what actually happened.
It's unfortunate...
There is no way there can be a happy ending.
- Just tell me where you are...
- Please...
Shut up.
Maybe once in a lifetime you can be lucky enough to meet someone whose heart beats in time with your own.
And you know it's forever.
Rebecka is that person for me.
- It's all my fault.
I never should have told you, it's all my fault.
No, Rebecka, it's not your fault.
Just tell me where you are...
Let me take care of this.
- Honey, everything will be fine.
As you know, we did some work for"Save the Children".
I didn't notice anything at first...
But then I saw how Rebecka's mental health was deteriorating.
After a while she was unable to work.
She couldn't get out of bed...
You have to submit material to be accepted into a ring like that...
And one of the members we didn't reveal the identity of an individual who called himself "Peter", submitted this.
The girl in the film is Rebecka.
And the man molesting her is her own father, Sten Schyttelius.
Her brother Jacob is holding the camera.
Don't scream.
We don't want to disturb Mummy, now do we?
Rebecka is eight years old here, and her brother is 14.
Both of them molested her regularly from time she was five.
- What did I say?
- That I mustn't scream.
Because then you know who will come, don't you?
Satan, Rebecka.
And you don't want Satan to come, because when Satan takes you, it hurts for real.
By the time she was 11, her father lost interest in her.
Unfortunately, her brother didn't.
Rebecka was forced to shut up and take it.
Put that rifle away, Christian.
Let's talk about it instead.
Christian, there is help available out there...
There is nothing that can help this situation.
Not any more.
When I realized that Rebecka would never be well again...
That's when I decided to kill them.
They destroyed her life.
They deserved to die several times over.
But I didn't intend things to end this way.
We have decided to do this, there is no future for us.
This is the end of the line.
Rebecka...
Come with me.
Hello...
There's something I haven't had time to tell you...
Well, "had time" isn't...
I guess I didn't...
That sacrificial ceremony...
- I know where it took place.
- You do?
How do you know that?
The woman in those pictures is me.

###
Riotous cacophony to accompany...
Talma into our next phenomenon.
Prepare to be amazed and mystified by the ultimate feat of transfiguration!
Now, I ask for only one thing.
Your silence.
Pay very close attention.
That's good.
Watch closely and learn why we call this
Aquarius.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I now give you, like the mermaids of legend, Talma!
Is she supposed to be in there?
Uh, yeah, looks like it.
Again, I give you
Talma!
Poor girl.
I'm sorry.
I heard they're supposed to be pretty good, but...
Uh, not...
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I, uh...
Close it.
Close it now!
I don't think this is part of the show.
No.
Will someone call 911?
Excuse me for a minute, okay?
Yeah.
Oh, come on, Charlie, I can't believe this.
Celtic green in my house!
Those were the stakes, my friend.
I'm sorry.
The Lakers lost the Finals.
No, no.
You will wear it.
You're just not into b-ball, huh?
I'm wearing it.
I'm wearing it.
Uh, you see how it brings out the worst in otherwise reasonable people?
Larry, when you were in that monastery, you think you figured anything out?
I remind you,
I was thrown out of that monastery.
But what do you mean, figured things out?
Like, in terms of what?
I went to this temple the other night.
Really?
Yeah.
And, uh, I hadn't been in one since my mother's funeral.
Before that, I
- I was probably 13.
That is quite a span.
So, what brought you back?
Well...
So it goes.
Yeah, David.
What's up?
I thought you were on a date.
Yeah, I'm on my way.
Got to go to the Tower of Mystery.
Tower of Mystery.
Tower of Mystery?
One of those LA landmarks I've always wanted to see.
I got a magician who disappeared.
Magician who disappeared?
Isn't that what's supposed to happen?
Two magicians were on the stage.
One does patter, other one does a trick.
Talma, no last name- she was in that thing right there, flowers swirling around her, then poof, she's gone, and it's filled with water.
That's a good trick, I guess.
That's what I thought, but according to her partner, The Amazing Susanna, aka Susie Weisz,
Talma's not supposed to disappear.
She's supposed to stay in that thing, Aquarius, swimming around in the water.
She's never supposed to leave the cylinder.
She stays in there for the entire trick, but... she just disappeared.
A woman transposed from air to water, back to the beginning of life.
Can we please go home now?
Talma is hiding under the stage.
No, she's not hiding under the stage.
You really want to follow thugh with this hoax?
'Cause, I tell you, I've learned from personal experience- you don't mess with the FBI.
I'm not sure I know what you're talking about.
The cylinder looks complete, but the stage is actually seven inches deeper than the proscenium indicates.
Well, yeah, but that has nothing to do with the trick.
Seven inches is plenty deep for Talma to disappear under the stage.
No, you don't understand.
We have rehearsed this hundreds of times, and she has always been in there.
Open the trap door, please.
What trap door?
Hey, if there's a door there, buddy, you better open it.
Hey, she may pay you.
Does she pay you enough to go to jail for filing a false FBI report?
Open the door!
Okay.
Ladies and Gentlemen, may I present to you the vanished Talma?
Tell me that blood is part of the trick.
-==ÆÆÀÃÐÜ×ÖÄ"×é==- Ê±¼äÖá£ºÂ¬ ±ó²ËÖí
Our techs put it between one and two liters of blood in that box, so something bad happened down there.
I mean, we're sure she was in here?
No one saw her, but our lab results will tell us something.
All right, let's havit.
Where is she?
I don't know.
You already lied to the FBI, okay?
You told us that Talma wasn't supposed to leave Aquarius.
Then we got the trap door.
You want to go for strike three now?
I think I should talk to my lawyer.
Oh, yeah.
Forgot about my date, Sarah.
I'll be right back, all right?
The blood could be a prop, could be part of the act, you know?
Spray some blood on the walls, vanish, voila, you got a great trick.
So a hoax?
It's easy enough to figure out.
We'll use an application of blood spatter trigonometry to study the correlation between this blood and then
Talma's probable position in the box.
Sounds like a place to start.
Now, I would assume, these pipes are for the pumping of the water.
Yeah, and I'm thinking these angled air movers in the corners get the air swirling.
Oh, dear.
I'm gonna get some latex gloves.
Professor Charles Eppes?
I'm, uh, Penn llette.
Penn and Teller?
I'm a big fan.
You are?
Yeah.
I've read everything you've written.
I even read your book.
Not as good as the original paper, but, uh...
Oh.
I was upstairs prepping a special and heard you were down here.
Man, it is so great to meet you in person.
Well, you know, uh, actually, I'm a big fan of yours, as well.
Really?
Cool.
Yeah, you work with the other guy, right?
Yeah, yeah.
Okay.
I like the white tigers.
I could never get Feynman to go to Vegas, either.
You knew Feynman?
Really easy guy to fool, and loved every minute of it.
All right.
It was a great pleasure meeting you.
I've got to get back to work.
Of course.
Uh, I'd love to talk to you about your paper about Infinite Series Cognitive Dissonance
Leading to Semantic Contamination.
That's not my paper.
White tigers.
All right.
I heard about Talma.
If you need any help, well, I know a little bit about magic.
Thank you, Mr. Jillette.
Sarah?
!
Excuse me.
Sorry about that.
Got to...
It's okay.
I get it.
Job comes first.
I'll make it up to you, okay?
Maybe...
You seem like a good guy.
Maybe under different circumstances.
Let me call you a cab.
Too late.
Excuse me, Agent?
Is the FBI involved in the case of a missing woman?
Is it true that a large amount of blood was found at the scene?
I'm sorry.
No comment.
We're in the middle of an ongoing investigation.
All right?
So, you guys excuse me.
Tha you.
Excuse...
Move.
What we do know right now is that a magician is missing...
And Talma No-Last-Name started disappearing before last night.
DMV comes up empty, no medical records.
So, I guess we can forget about a blood match, huh?
What else did you get?
Our lady Copperfields have a history of fake emergencies.
2007, Boulder, Colorado.
They do this buried alive illusion.
As they piled the dirt on, Talma's casket collapses.
It takes emergency crews 45 minutes to dig up an empty coffin.
Three months later,
Fairbanks, Alaska- same deal with an escape from a fire that failed.
And let me guess.
Both times Talma miraculously reappeared unharmed?
Uh-huh.
They paid 50 grand in fines, sold 250 grand in tickets.
That box looks secure from the inside.
That's what I'm thinking, too.
There's no way she got out of that without help.
And her partner was on stage the whole time.
Oh, of course.
That's what magicians do.
You know, make it look like they're here when they're not, right?
I saw a special where one guy made a limo disappear.
Turns out, it was 14 guys, a mirror and three pieces of plywood painted asphalt black.
Yeah.
Well, I'm working on a list of people they've both worked with.
Figure, maybe one of them will pop.
Yeah, for a crime we're not even sure happened, my head hurts.
WOMAN Is it true that a large amount of blood was found at the scene?
Uh, no comnt.
Uh, sorry.
We're in the middle of an ongoing investigation.
Ah, Agent Harry Potter, first on the scene.
WOMAN Well, what we do know right now is that...
If I had taken her anywhere else, man, a movie, anything, there'd be another date.
Stop bitching.
Give her a call.
Right, you're a big TV star now.
She's gonna love that.
So, of course, now I got the assistant director on my ass about why one of our agents has dragged us into a case that's gonna make us look like idiots.
Don, I'm sorry.
She...
We got to find the girl now, all right?
You ever get the feeling you're searching for an answer you already have?
Well, so much for an unbiased search for the truth.
Is Charlie still determined to predetermine the results?
That's not fair.
I think you're cherry-picking the data to give you the answer you expect.
You pick the next batch.
Who doesn't like magic?
Top hat and tails and pulling bunnies out of thin air.
It's...
Elvis on black velvet.
Well, I love the feeling of a live audience, swept up in the suspense of the show, trying to figure out the trick, looking for the mirrors.
Yes, and just a little relieved when you don't see them.
I'll show you the mirrors.
Oh, no, you don't, Dr. Eppes.
I won't let you ruin this for me, too.
So, the serology report on the blood found at the scene verifies that it is human, O positive.
There's Barr bodies in the cell structure and the Kell antigen, which indicates that it's a white female.
And the DNA in the hair sample that we picked up in her dressing room does match the DNA in the blood, so very good chance it was Talma in that box.
All right, so let's say it's not a hoax.
Let's say it's real- who'd want to hurt Talma?
The partner?
Susie Weisz, a known box jumper, the beautiful assistant, but not a real magician until she she started working with Talma.
Talma's good-looking, from all accounts, the more talented magician.
Why would she switch places, basically taking the assistant's job and put herself in the cylinder?
Who knows?
The fact still remains that Talma was the big draw, right, so I doubt the Amazing Susanna would do anything to try to harm her meal ticket.
I've been running down some more of the names of the people that perform with them- nobody's talking.
I mean, it seems like the world of magic is all about keeping a secret.
I still say this is just one more stunt.
You know, fake a felony, get on the news, get famous.
So, what's the blood supposed to mean?
Well, there's what it usually means.
So, blood spatter trigonometry suggests the spatter is real.
Uh, it came from a body being torn by a sharp force trauma.
So, you know what happened inside the box?
We weren't trying to reconstruct the actual event.
We were looking to validate or rather invalidate the blood spatter.
It's like when you walk outside and you notice that the ground is wet.
The question is:
Did it rain or is the water coming from somewhere else?
A droplet of water falling in a vertical line from a cloud will slam to the ground and splash outward.
Water from a garden hose will have an entirely different mathematical signature.
Different vectors, velocity, a far more obtuse angle.
So, we compare the rain triangle to the garden hose triangle to tell us if it rained or if your neighbor just recently washed his car.
Now, we were able to analyze the pattern of the blood droplets, as well as the angle and velocity of the impact to determine with fairly high probability that Talma did suffer a real injury.
Now, whether it was an accident or the result of some sort of struggle, I'm not sure.
I would love to consult with an expert who might be able to tell me which it was.
Yeah, sure, go for it.
Hey, what happened with your, uh, date?
Did you call her?
Yeah, she's not answering.
Go bring her some flowers or something- we'll be all right for an hour.
Hi, uh, I'm David.
I'm...
I'm looking for Sarah.
Sarah?
This is, uh, 1F, right?
I...
I picked her up here last night.
We just got back today.
I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am.
Is it... is it possible maybe, uh, Sarah is staying here?
Long hair,
African-American?
We have lived here for 33 years.?
ñ|
Whose idea was it to goto this magic show?
Hers.
And you met her at the Howling Dog, right?
That's a known cop bar.
A set-up from the start.
A couple of magicians want to amp up the disappearance of their main act, what better way than to get FBI in on a missing persons investigation?
Yeah, I hope she was hot.
Hey, don't feel so bad, big guy.
You know, I'm thinking a night out, no matter what, sounds pretty good.
And I don't care what that blood says, I say we're being played.
Yeah, time to talk to the Amazing Susna again.
You've made a career of demystification.
But we weren't the first.
Houdini dedicated his life to revealing these charlatans that defraud the human race with their lies, the talking to the dead, the psychics.
Yes, well, the blood spatter was not faked.
The FBI suspects that there was a third party involved in Talma's disappearance.
An illusion this complicated, she would have needed the help of an artisan.
An artisan?
Yeah, the people who actually build and design the tricks.
Angel has, like, 30 of these guys working for him.
You know, we'd both love to see these blueprints.
Good luck.
A trick like Aquarius is worth millions to the guy who creates it.
Once these women do it, it becomes public domain- within a year, you got 20 acts doing their versions.
The Swimming Pool, the Water Cube, the Shark Tank.
Let me show you this thing.
This was a feature trick 30 years ago.
Done on TV and everything.
Now you can buy it at any toy store.
That's the way things work in this business.
Neat trick, huh?
Hydrophobic sand.
You do know your magic.
I know my science.
It's gonna be hard to find this engineer.
No one will reveal who the artisans are, especially not the artisans.
Henning had to deposit money in an untraceable bank account to look at some blueprints.
Maybe we don't need to know.
Maybe we can reverse engineer the trick on our own and find out who built it.
Study the architecture to find the architect.
You do know your science.
Well, no.
I know my magic.
It wasn't supposed to be like this.
I mean, yes, we made you part of the show.
I mean, an FBI agent involved... it adds to the hype, but that blood was not part of the illusion.
So... what is the trick?
I mean, uh... how does Aquarius work?
Well, I...
I don't know.
I mean, that's Talma's thing.
I do patter, exhibition.
Misdirection.
Well... yeah.
I'm gonna... need the name- the real name- of my date.
Well, I...
I have no idea.
Talma set it up.
She just told me to expect a cop and to keep him occupied and away from the box.
When that math guy opened it, I expected her to be in there.
That was how we rehearsed it every time.
So, she doesn't tell you how the trick works.
All right, she lies to you about the endgame, then she puts you in the middle of an FBI investigation?
She used me.
She didn't get out of that box by herself, so who besides yourself would help her?
Garland Saint Michael.
Formerly the Miraculous Michael.
You know your magic.
He's on our list of Talma's...
past collaborators.
He and Talma were hot and heavy before he got all mystic-purist.
Uh, he's the guy who hung himself from flesh hooks for 24 hours on live TV.
And that's magic?
He thinks so.
I'll spend six days in my Dream Cocoon.
Total sensory deprivation.
Do you wish to lay in it?
No, thanks.
On the seventh day, I'll emerge, an altered state of consciousness, unable to take even the slightest sound or color for granted.
Yeah, I bet you'll be hungry, too.
Talma and I remain close, and I wish her all success.
We differ in tone, but unite in passion.
You do realize she's missing.
Is she?
Where were you last night?
Las Vegas.
Drove in this morning.
I'm sure Caesar's has security footage of me preparing for my next piece.
Do you know where she is, what she's planning?
We haven't even spoken for months.
But I'm not surprised she went with the classic- the Vanishing Lady.
That's really the core of our differences.
Magic isn't magic until it elevates the human spirit.
Talma is stagnating, attempting to make art from rubbish.
Is that why she let Susie Weisz play the part of the magician?
Talma needs to be in the middle of the action.
Touching the trick, really feeling it.
Oh, on that much we agree.
We found a liter of blood at the scene.
She's a genius.
No matter how mundane,
Talma would literally bleed for a trick.
I have faith that when she reveals herself to the world, it's going to be beautiful.
Let's consider the Gliederpuppe.
David said the cylinder was empty.
Then, the lights went out for a few seconds.
Then, the cylinder was filled.
Well, let's be conservative here.
How about five seconds?
That's a long time for the audience to be sitting in the dark.
Let's say 3.5.
Coming up through the floor, fighting gravity, the water pressure required to fill that cylinder in such a short time...
The pressure on the human body would be enormous.
That makes Talma one tough lady.
It's an amazing feat, really.
I mean, it's almost like her response to the misogyny of cutting a woman in half.
She's created this...
this mechanical paean to the beauty of womankind.
She reverse evolves the female, surrounded by flowers, then she drops her right back into the elegance of the ocean where all life began.
It's almost like Venus returning to her clamshell.
You really see all that?
You really don't?
All I see is pipes and air movers and flowers and fish being pumped in and sucked out.
Why can't you accept magic as an art?
Why allow yourself to be pummeled by water pressure every night.
Isn't there an Occam's razor here?
I mean, you said yourself, the solutions to magic tricks are often underwhelming and simple.
Why do the "reverse evolution?"
Why water coming in every night?
Uh-huh.
You see these and these?
Well, isn't that just where the glass connects to the decoration on the outside?
I think Larry's half right.
Thissn't a reverse evolution trick.
This is a woman coming out of the water.
And into the air.
She flies?
She flies.
The micro thin flying wires for the harness enter through the cylinder here and here.
It's unseen by the audience.
She looks like she's flying in a fully-encased cylinder.
David didn't say anything about flying.
And we didn't find a rig in the rafters at the Tower of Mystery because that wasn't part of the trick that night.
There's a second part to the trick?
Ah, but of course.
The stunning conclusion.
The vanished woman reappears, in the glory of flight.
We need to flip this trick, make it work backwards.
Yeah, reverse the reverse engineering.
Worst ways to spend a night.
I'll go put a kettle on.
Hey.
Late supper?
On a little break.
Lost in contemplation?
Yeah.
You know, when last we spoke, you were asking me about religion.
Right.
Well, at the very basic level, cosmological quantum physics suggests that if this universe here is as real as we believe that it is, it must have been cast into reality by an external observer.
God?
And yet paradoxically, how can there be anything external in an all-inclusive universe?
Uh-huh.
So, you see?
My own quest for God has always been inextricably intertwined with my work.
Does that help you sleep?
No.
It keeps me awake.
All right, so, what's the point?
The point is to keep looking for the point.
That's what the Rabbi said.
Rabbi?
Yeah.
Rabbi.
Well...
I will rejoin Charlie and Amita.
Oh, and I should do that, too.
Tough to track a woman without an identity, but I found Talma's corporation.
Two weeks ago, Aquarius Specialties Limited rented trucks to load in at the Tower of Mystery.
Now, where'd the trucks pick up from?
Movers said that they picked up two big crates in the middle of an abandoned parking lot.
Paranoid magicians.
Yeah, hoax the FBI- I'd hide my prep, too.
Aquarius Specialties Limited also rented a storefront on Hollywood Boulevard.
It's a high traffic area, lots of tourists, entertainment seekers.
Charlie thinks there's gonna be a part two to Talma's trick
Which is why I checked into the party rental agencies in the area.
Two of them have been contracted to deliver folding chairs, tents and big screen TV's to the same location.
Come on.
"Hollywood Brasserie"?
Talma loves her misdirection.
Oh, come on, now, does it really need to be this dark?
You scared, Granger?
Nah.
Pitch-black was top of my class in "Pitchblack Assaults on Magical Illusions" back in Quantico.
Let's see.
Lights.
?
Murder?
Well, ME's initial report is inconclusive.
Talma drowned, but she has a contusion on the side of her head, too.
She also had a laceration on her right leg, pretty deep.
That explains the blood we found at the Tower of Mystery.
However she got cut, accidental or otherwise, the wound was bandaged, trace amounts of blood in the water.
She didn't bleed to death.
According to Charlie's analysis, this was the master fail-safe- it's a handle that would release the water.
Now it was broken off and wiped clean of prints, so, definitely somebody was here.
Hairline fracture in the glass could match the contusion on her head.
Yeah, I'm thinking maybe there was a struggle, and she got knocked out against the glass.
Yeah, then the killer dumped her, unconscious, in the water to drown.
All right, so they broke the handle- that's master fail-safe, so the internal ones wouldn't work.
It still doesn't answer one big question.
Who'd want to kill her?
Why can't they just build a normal machine, with everything laid out in an orderly fashion?
Function fit to form.
The magic design for the magic machine.
Let's take a break from the flying part.
You know, it's like a jigsaw puzzle.
You put together the frame pieces before trying to work the more difficult middle section.
You know she's right.
If we could just get a handle on the cylinder, we could figure out how much tensile strength is needed for these flying wires and how much for the common joints between the glass and filigree.
Uh, the glass.
That's simple.
Yeah.
The first question.
How much water can it handle?
Well, witnesses from the performance report that it was full.
Talkin' 50 cubic feet of water.
400 gallons.
Water weight 3,300 pounds.
A little over one a half tons.
Wow.
That amount of water... withstanding that kind of pressure.
You're not gonna find that kind of glass at Home Depot.
There are two factories that produce the quality of glass that Charlie says is required to create the cylinder.
Asahi Glass in Tokyo and Undverglasen in Garmisch, Germany.
Undverglasen shipped four tons of multi-ply tempered-curved glass to a Burbank warehouse last year.
Well, before she hit the fast track with Susie Weisz, she bounced around for about five years.
Why's that?
Maybe because her previous boss drowned while was on stage.
Who's the girl in the middle?
That's Drowndini's assistant.
That could be a lead.
Sister blames Talma for her brother's death.
Yeah, same MO, drowning, could fit for revenge.
That's my date.
Sarah.
Her real name is Jenny Calandro.
Can't believe your search led you to the doorstep of Gage Jones.
Impressive, Dr. Eppes.
Uh, guy's one of the legendary Artisans of the magic world.
Of course, last I knew, he was, uh, working in an abandoned ferry on Fidalgo Island in Washington.
Is all right that we just let ourselves in like this?
Oh, I called ahead.
Uh, magic awaits.
Professor Fleinhardt, if you would, please.
My pleasure.
Around here.
The guillotine!
It's a far better thing I do, than I have ever done.
The blade folds up into the trick.
Shh!
It's angles.
It's all angles.
That's all I'm saying.
Okay, let's, uh, show you another one.
How about the Kafka box?
Are you ready to metamorphosize?
Into what, a cockroach?
So this one is a false back.
He's still inside the box.
Okay, that's pretty cool.
He climbs in, Penn spins the box, engages the catch, the catch releases two mirrors.
The mirrors fold out at 45 degree angles.
You think you're looking at the back of the box, it's really just reflections.
Hey, quiet you.
Mr. Jillette.
Three guests.
From the FBI.
You're here because of the lovely and talented Miss Talma, I take it.
Well, may be a wasted trip, she's not here.
But she'll turn up in due time at a place of her choosing, for the best possible impact.
I hate to break it to you, she already turned up.
Oh, was it wondrous?
She was dead.
Real dead.
But I... just saw her.
I mean I built Aquarius.
She was found in the second part of the trick on Hollywood Boulevard.
She drowned inside.
No, couldn't have drowned.
We had too many fail-safes built in.
There was a handle on the outside that was broken off by someone else.
You know a, a girl, a former assistant- Jenny Calandro?
Yeah,
I know Jenny.
Talma brought her around a couple times to look at Aquarius.
You got an address?
We think it may not have been an accident.
You're damn right it wasn't an accident.
If Talma's dead, she was murdered.
Hello.
Hi.
Oh, hey.
What's on?
Baseball, basketball, football, hockey.
Take your pick.
What, you got to ask?
Hockey.
That's right
So what is, uh, what is all this about you, uh, going to temple?
I went once.
Yeah, and?
Thinking I might take a class or two.
You know, I'd be more than happy to talk to you about it.
I mean, I've been to Hebrew school.
I know all the prayers.
Thanks.
We'll see how it goes.
I think I'm okay for now.
Right.
Hockey.
I know I'm still new and all, but is this status quo for you guys?
What's that?
Stalking girls on company time.
My date's home.
Jenny.
You've got to be kidding me.
You do have a way with the ladies.
You are not playing chicken with the FBI.
Yeah, she is pretty.
?
I swear.
You blamed her for your brother's death.
You wanted revenge.
Anthony was reckless.
He didn't check his gear, his machines.
He thought that if they worked once, they always worked.
That's what killed him, and I knew that.
Oh, so it was a coincidence that you were at the show the night that Talma disappeared?
I mean, the night she was murdered.
Talma dealt with my brother's death differently.
I moved on.
She made it her life's work to court death.
I brought you to the show, because an old friend asked me to.
I was her assistant, nothing more.
You helped her out of that box?
As soon as you left, I went under the stage, removed the hatch.
Talma was covered in her own blood.
When she fell through the trap door, she hit a metal strut, tore her leg open.
No, we never found a bloody strut.
She took it, said it added to the mystery.
Look, I wanted to take her to the hospital, but she insisted she was fine.
We bandaged the leg,
I helped her to her car and she drove off on her own.
Where'd she go?
To Hollywood.
To make sure the second Aquarius was working properly.
I told you, she learned from what happened to my brother.
My job was to get back to you.
You were just supposed to be some... cop.
I could have gone up to any guy in that bar.
But I was selfish.
I went up to the right one.
Best sucker in the house.
Not what I meant.
She lying?
I doubt it.
But, hey, I'm the last guy you should ask, right?
What are you talking about?
You're the only one I can ask.
Don, send somebody else in there... to talk to her.
Well, either she's very good, or she does like you.
I believe she knew Talma.
I believe she was working with Talma that night.
And I believe there's much better ways to get payback than to sucker an FBI agent into watching you kill your target.
Yeah, I agree with you.
So what do we do with her?
She committed a crime, and she ran.
You make the call.
How much have they dismantled?
Apparently, the veneer was taken down, but the guts remain.
The guts, which are usually under the stage and lead to a panel offstage where the technician calls the shots.
These must be the fail-safe dials.
Check the glass.
All right, looks like there are two switches hidden inside the cylinder:
one high and one low.
Water release valves.
The techs indicate they've not been touched.
It's a good gument for Talma being unconscious.
She couldn't trip the fail-safes.
One, two, three input pipes.
Reconstruction of the apparatus indicates there should be at least four.
Should be six if they were playing it safe.
So to fill this cylinder with three pipes in five seconds...
Or less.
would require higher water pressure than we'd anticipated, extremely high water pressure.
Where does that leave us?
All right, hey.
We don't think Talma was murdered.
No, our findings suggest that higher than intended pressure was ultimately responsible for Talma's death.
So this is all an accident?
The flaw was in the machine.
Well, how can you figure that out if you never even saw the trick being performed?
We used Design Recovery.
It was originally implemented to handle secretive computer software systems hidden within coding:
illusions, ghosts in the machine.
To a first-time viewer, a staple jt looks like a tiny piece of metal holding your papers together.
But pry it loose and study its dimensions, how it bends, you realize at some point it changed shape to achieve its goal.
Put it under a microscope and you see telltale signs it was attached to others of its kind.
Without seeing the staple's origin, we reverse engineer the unseen machine that put our tiny little piece of metal to work.
Most likely, Talma climbed in, and then someone else started Aquarius.
However, the water filled up too quickly.
She slammed her head against the glass on the inside.
Added to the blood loss, it knocked her unconscious.
Which is why she never engaged any of the security devices inside the machine.
Yeah, it doesn't explain the handle, the fracture, the other person, why they didn't let her out...
We think they tried.
They pulled the handle, but that failed.
Yeah, they tried another way: brute force.
We found this fracture in the exact structurally weakest place.
It wasn't Talma's head that cracked the glass, it was probably somebody with a sledgehammer.
So all the signs of attempted murder were actually evidence that someone tried to save her.
Yeah, and there was only one person, other than Talma, that had inside knowledge about this trick:
the man who built it.
Magicians have something against track lighting or what?
This place is a lot less threatening during the day, trust me.
Jones?
Don't make us have to come get you!
NIKKI I think we got him.
What's the matter, there was no bed to hide under?
Got him.
Tried so hard to get her out.
You got to believe me.
An artisan's worst nightmare is to have a trick go wrong.
You gave us Jenny Calandro, knowing she was innocent.
Why didn't you tell us before?
I wanted to, it's just... she was out cold, laying there as the water killed her.
The fail-safes...
We know.
Her chest stopped moving.
I was inches away from her when she died.
It was an accident.
All you had to do was come forward.
Oh, and watch my entire career, my greatest invention, die with her?
Nobody buys illusions that kill you for real.
So, hmm, how was that?
Well... to be honest, Mom's was better.
Oh, come on.
It's the same recipe.
I'm just saying.
That's all, I'm just saying.
Hey, listen, Donny, um... do you feel like I cheated you out something?
We were never a religious family.
It's not about that.
I just...
I always used to know exactly what I was doing, why I was doing it, you know, what I wanted and...
I just...
I feel like I'm missing something.
So, you, um... you think, uh, you'll find it by going to temple?
I don't know.
I just know where it's not.
You know, it's not in the job.
I know, but I...
I never... taught you about, you know, God and... or gave you that choice.
No, you did.
You know, look where I'm looking for it.
Right.
So, um... that's it?
That's all I got.
I cooked, you do the dishes.
Don't look at your phone as if it's gonna ring and save you.
Just do the dishes.
This is hardly a romantic spot.
It's not a romantic spot.
It's a learning spot.
Help me with this.
Amita?
I want to show you what I see in magic.
Uh, I see a harness.
Yes.
go over there to the switchboard.
Flip switch seven.
Uh, hey, are we sure this is safe?
Well, we know the design better than anybody.
Eight.
Nine.
Ten.
Do you see it yet?
Clap your hands
Riotous cacophony to accompany...
Talma into our next phenomenon.
Prepare to be amazed and mystified by the ultimate feat of transfiguration!
Now, I ask for only one thing.
Your silence.
Pay very close attention.
That's good.
Watch closely and learn why we call this
Aquarius.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I now give you, like the mermaids of legend, Talma!
Is she supposed to be in there?
Uh, yeah, looks like it.
Again, I give you
Talma!
Poor girl.
I'm sorry.
I heard they're supposed to be pretty good, but...
Uh, not...
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I, uh...
Close it.
Close it now!
I don't think this is part of the show.
No.
Will someone call 911?
Excuse me for a minute, okay?
Yeah.
Oh, come on, Charlie, I can't believe this.
Celtic green in my house!
Those were the stakes, my friend.
I'm sorry.
The Lakers lost the Finals.
No, no.
You will wear it.
You're just not into b-ball, huh?
I'm wearing it.
I'm wearing it.
Uh, you see how it brings out the worst in otherwise reasonable people?
Larry, when you were in that monastery, you think you figured anything out?
I remind you,
I was thrown out of that monastery.
But what do you mean, figured things out?
Like, in terms of what?
I went to this temple the other night.
Really?
Yeah.
And, uh, I hadn't been in one since my mother's funeral.
Before that, I
- I was probably 13.
That is quite a span.
So, what brought you back?
Well...
So it goes.
Yeah, David.
What's up?
I thought you were on a date.
Yeah, I'm on my way.
Got to go to the Tower of Mystery.
Tower of Mystery.
Tower of Mystery?
One of those LA landmarks I've always wanted to see.
I got a magician who disappeared.
Magician who disappeared?
Isn't that what's supposed to happen?
Two magicians were on the stage.
One does patter, other one does a trick.
Talma, no last name- she was in that thing right there, flowers swirling around her, then poof, she's gone, and it's filled with water.
That's a good trick, I guess.
That's what I thought, but according to her partner, The Amazing Susanna, aka Susie Weisz,
Talma's not supposed to disappear.
She's supposed to stay in that thing, Aquarius, swimming around in the water.
She's never supposed to leave the cylinder.
She stays in there for the entire trick, but... she just disappeared.
A woman transposed from air to water, back to the beginning of life.
Can we please go home now?
Talma is hiding under the stage.
No, she's not hiding under the stage.
You really want to follow thugh with this hoax?
'Cause, I tell you, I've learned from personal experience - you don't mess with the FBI.
I'm not sure I know what you're talking about.
The cylinder looks complete, but the stage is actually seven inches deeper than the proscenium indicates.
Well, yeah, but that has nothing to do with the trick.
Seven inches is plenty deep for Talma to disappear under the stage.
No, you don't understand.
We have rehearsed this hundreds of times, and she has always been in there.
Open the trap door, please.
What trap door?
Hey, if there's a door there, buddy, you better open it.
Hey, she may pay you.
Does she pay you enough to go to jail for filing a false FBI report?
Open the door!
Okay.
Ladies and Gentlemen, may I present to you the vanished Talma?
Tell me that blood is part of the trick.
Our techs put it between one and two liters of blood in that box, so something bad happened down there.
I mean, we're sure she was in here?
No one saw her, but our lab results will tell us something.
All right, let's havit.
Where is she?
I don't know.
You already lied to the FBI, okay?
You told us that Talma wasn't supposed to leave Aquarius.
Then we got the trap door.
You want to go for strike three now?
I think I should talk to my lawyer.
Oh, yeah.
Forgot about my date, Sarah.
I'll be right back, all right?
The blood could be a prop, could be part of the act, you know?
Spray some blood on the walls, vanish, voila, you got a great trick.
So a hoax?
It's easy enough to figure out.
We'll use an application of blood spatter trigonometry to study the correlation between this blood and then
Talma's probable position in the box.
Sounds like a place to start.
Now, I would assume, these pipes are for the pumping of the water.
Yeah, and I'm thinking these angled air movers in the corners get the air swirling.
Oh, dear.
I'm gonna get some latex gloves.
Professor Charles Eppes?
I'm, uh, Penn llette.
Penn and Teller?
I'm a big fan.
You are?
Yeah.
I've read everything you've written.
I even read your book.
Not as good as the original paper, but, uh...
Oh.
I was upstairs prepping a special and heard you were down here.
Man, it is so great to meet you in person.
Well, you know, uh, actually, I'm a big fan of yours, as well.
Really?
Cool.
Yeah, you work with the other guy, right?
Yeah, yeah.
Okay.
I like the white tigers.
I could never get Feynman to go to Vegas, either.
You knew Feynman?
Really easy guy to fool, and loved every minute of it.
All right.
It was a great pleasure meeting you.
I've got to get back to work.
Of course.
Uh, I'd love to talk to you about your paper about Infinite Series Cognitive Dissonance
Leading to Semantic Contamination.
That's not my paper.
White tigers.
All right.
I heard about Talma.
If you need any help, well, I know a little bit about magic.
Thank you, Mr. Jillette.
Sarah?
!
Excuse me.
Sorry about that.
Got to...
It's okay.
I get it.
Job comes first.
I'll make it up to you, okay?
Maybe...
You seem like a good guy.
Maybe under different circumstances.
Let me call you a cab.
Too late.
Excuse me, Agent?
Is the FBI involved in the case of a missing woman?
Is it true that a large amount of blood was found at the scene?
I'm sorry.
No comment.
We're in the middle of an ongoing investigation.
All right?
So, you guys excuse me.
Tha you.
Excuse...
Move.
What we do know right now is that a magician is missing...
And Talma No-Last-Name started disappearing before last night.
DMV comes up empty, no medical records.
So, I guess we can forget about a blood match, huh?
What else did you get?
Our lady Copperfields have a history of fake emergencies.
2007, Boulder, Colorado.
They do this buried alive illusion.
As they piled the dirt on, Talma's casket collapses.
It takes emergency crews 45 minutes to dig up an empty coffin.
Three months later,
Fairbanks, Alaska - same deal with an escape from a fire that failed.
And let me guess.
Both times Talma miraculously reappeared unharmed?
Uh-huh.
They paid 50 grand in fines, sold 250 grand in tickets.
That box looks secure from the inside.
That's what I'm thinking, too.
There's no way she got out of that without help.
And her partner was on stage the whole time.
Oh, of course.
That's what magicians do.
You know, make it look like they're here when they're not, right?
I saw a special where one guy made a limo disappear.
Turns out, it was 14 guys, a mirror and three pieces of plywood painted asphalt black.
Yeah.
Well, I'm working on a list of people they've both worked with.
Figure, maybe one of them will pop.
Yeah, for a crime we're not even sure happened, my head hurts.
Is it true that a large amount of blood was found at the scene?
Uh, no comnt.
Uh, sorry.
We're in the middle of an ongoing investigation.
Ah, Agent Harry Potter, first on the scene.
Well, what we do know right now is that...
If I had taken her anywhere else, man, a movie, anything, there'd be another date.
Stop bitching.
Give her a call.
Right, you're a big TV star now.
She's gonna love that.
So, of course, now I got the assistant director on my ass about why one of our agents has dragged us into a case that's gonna make us look like idiots.
Don, I'm sorry.
She...
We got to find the girl now, all right?
You ever get the feeling you're searching for an answer you already have?
Well, so much for an unbiased search for the truth.
Is Charlie still determined to predetermine the results?
That's not fair.
I think you're cherry-picking the data to give you the answer you expect.
You pick the next batch.
Who doesn't like magic?
Top hat and tails and pulling bunnies out of thin air.
It's...
Elvis on black velvet.
Well, I love the feeling of a live audience, swept up in the suspense of the show, trying to figure out the trick, looking for the mirrors.
Yes, and just a little relieved when you don't see them.
I'll show you the mirrors.
Oh, no, you don't, Dr. Eppes.
I won't let you ruin this for me, too.
So, the serology report on the blood found at the scene verifies that it is human, O positive.
There's Barr bodies in the cell structure and the Kell antigen, which indicates that it's a white female.
And the DNA in the hair sample that we picked up in her dressing room does match the DNA in the blood, so very good chance it was Talma in that box.
All right, so let's say it's not a hoax.
Let's say it's real - who'd want to hurt Talma?
The partner?
Susie Weisz, a known box jumper, the beautiful assistant, but not a real magician until she she started working with Talma.
Talma's good-looking, from all accounts, the more talented magician.
Why would she switch places, basically taking the assistant's job and put herself in the cylinder?
Who knows?
The fact still remains that Talma was the big draw, right, so I doubt the Amazing Susanna would do anything to try to harm her meal ticket.
I've been running down some more of the names of the people that perform with them - nobody's talking.
I mean, it seems like the world of magic is all about keeping a secret.
I still say this is just one more stunt.
You know, fake a felony, get on the news, get famous.
So, what's the blood supposed to mean?
Well, there's what it usually means.
So, blood spatter trigonometry suggests the spatter is real.
Uh, it came from a body being torn by a sharp force trauma.
So, you know what happened inside the box?
We weren't trying to reconstruct the actual event.
We were looking to validate or rather invalidate the blood spatter.
It's like when you walk outside and you notice that the ground is wet.
The question is:
Did it rain or is the water coming from somewhere else?
A droplet of water falling in a vertical line from a cloud will slam to the ground and splash outward.
Water from a garden hose will have an entirely different mathematical signature.
Different vectors, velocity, a far more obtuse angle.
So, we compare the rain triangle to the garden hose triangle to tell us if it rained or if your neighbor just recently washed his car.
Now, we were able to analyze the pattern of the blood droplets, as well as the angle and velocity of the impact to determine with fairly high probability that Talma did suffer a real injury.
Now, whether it was an accident or the result of some sort of struggle, I'm not sure.
I would love to consult with an expert who might be able to tell me which it was.
Yeah, sure, go for it.
Hey, what happened with your, uh, date?
Did you call her?
Yeah, she's not answering.
Go bring her some flowers or something - we'll be all right for an hour.
Hi, uh, I'm David.
I'm...
I'm looking for Sarah.
Sarah?
This is, uh, 1F, right?
I...
I picked her up here last night.
We just got back today.
I'm sorry to bother you, ma'am.
Is it... is it possible maybe, uh, Sarah is staying here?
Long hair,
African-American?
We have lived here for 33 years.?
Whose idea was it to go to the magick show?
And you met her at the Howling Dog, right?
That's a known cop bar.
A set-up from the start.
A couple of magicians want to amp up the disappearance of their main act, what better way than to get FBI in on a missing persons investigation?
Yeah, I hope she was hot.
Hey, don't feel so bad, big guy.
You know, I'm thinking a night out, no matter what, sounds pretty good.
And I don't care what that blood says, I say we're being played.
Yeah, time to talk to the Amazing Susna again.
You've made a career of demystification.
But we weren't the first.
Houdini dedicated his life to revealing these charlatans that defraud the human race with their lies, the talking to the dead, the psychics.
Yes, well, the blood spatter was not faked.
The FBI suspects that there was a third party involved in Talma's disappearance.
An illusion this complicated, she would have needed the help of an artisan.
An artisan?
Yeah, the people who actually build and design the tricks.
Angel has, like, 30 of these guys working for him.
You know, we'd both love to see these blueprints.
Good luck.
A trick like Aquarius is worth millions to the guy who creates it.
Once these women do it, it becomes public domain - within a year, you got 20 acts doing their versions.
The Swimming Pool, the Water Cube, the Shark Tank.
Let me show you this thing.
This was a feature trick 30 years ago.
Done on TV and everything.
Now you can buy it at any toy store.
That's the way things work in this business.
Neat trick, huh?
Hydrophobic sand.
You do know your magic.
I know my science.
It's gonna be hard to find this engineer.
No one will reveal who the artisans are, especially not the artisans.
Henning had to deposit money in an untraceable bank account to look at some blueprints.
Maybe we don't need to know.
Maybe we can reverse engineer the trick on our own and find out who built it.
Study the architecture to find the architect.
You do know your science.
Well, no.
I know my magic.
It wasn't supposed to be like this.
I mean, yes, we made you part of the show.
I mean, an FBI agent involved... it adds to the hype, but that blood was not part of the illusion.
So... what is the trick?
I mean, uh... how does Aquarius work?
Well, I...
I don't know.
I mean, that's Talma's thing.
I do patter, exhibition.
Misdirection.
Well... yeah.
I'm gonna... need the name- the real name- of my date.
Well, I...
I have no idea.
Talma set it up.
She just told me to expect a cop and to keep him occupied and away from the box.
When that math guy opened it, I expected her to be in there.
That was how we rehearsed it every time.
So, she doesn't tell you how the trick works.
All right, she lies to you about the endgame, then she puts you in the middle of an FBI investigation?
She used me.
She didn't get out of that box by herself, so who besides yourself would help her?
Garland Saint Michael.
Formerly the Miraculous Michael.
You know your magic.
He's on our list of Talma's... past collaborators.
He and Talma were hot and heavy before he got all mystic-purist.
Uh, he's the guy who hung himself from flesh hooks for 24 hours on live TV.
And that's magic?
He thinks so.
I'll spend six days in my Dream Cocoon.
Total sensory deprivation.
Do you wish to lay in it?
No, thanks.
On the seventh day, I'll emerge, an altered state of consciousness, unable to take even the slightest sound or color for granted.
Yeah, I bet you'll be hungry, too.
Talma and I remain close, and I wish her all success.
We differ in tone, but unite in passion.
You do realize she's missing.
Is she?
Where were you last night?
Las Vegas.
Drove in this morning.
I'm sure Caesar's has security footage of me preparing for my next piece.
Do you know where she is, what she's planning?
We haven't even spoken for months.
But I'm not surprised she went with the classic - the Vanishing Lady.
That's really the core of our differences.
Magic isn't magic until it elevates the human spirit.
Talma is stagnating, attempting to make art from rubbish.
Is that why she let Susie Weisz play the part of the magician?
Talma needs to be in the middle of the action.
Touching the trick, really feeling it.
Oh, on that much we agree.
We found a liter of blood at the scene.
She's a genius.
No matter how mundane,
Talma would literally bleed for a trick.
I have faith that when she reveals herself to the world, it's going to be beautiful.
Let's consider the Gliederpuppe.
David said the cylinder was empty.
Then, the lights went out for a few seconds.
Then, the cylinder was filled.
Well, let's be conservative here.
How about five seconds?
That's a long time for the audience to be sitting in the dark.
Let's say 3.5.
Coming up through the floor, fighting gravity, the water pressure required to fill that cylinder in such a short time...
The pressure on the human body would be enormous.
That makes Talma one tough lady.
It's an amazing feat, really.
I mean, it's almost like her response to the misogyny of cutting a woman in half.
She's created this...
this mechanical paean to the beauty of womankind.
She reverse evolves the female, surrounded by flowers, then she drops her right back into the elegance of the ocean where all life began.
It's almost like Venus returning to her clamshell.
You really see all that?
You really don't?
All I see is pipes and air movers and flowers and fish being pumped in and sucked out.
Why can't you accept magic as an art?
Why allow yourself to be pummeled by water pressure every night.
Isn't there an Occam's razor here?
I mean, you said yourself, the solutions to magic tricks are often underwhelming and simple.
Why do the "reverse evolution?"
Why water coming in every night?
Uh-huh.
You see these and these?
Well, isn't that just where the glass connects to the decoration on the outside?
I think Larry's half right.
Thissn't a reverse evolution trick.
This is a woman coming out of the water.
And into the air.
She flies?
She flies.
The micro thin flying wires for the harness enter through the cylinder here and here.
It's unseen by the audience.
She looks like she's flying in a fully-encased cylinder.
David didn't say anything about flying.
And we didn't find a rig in the rafters at the Tower of Mystery because that wasn't part of the trick that night.
There's a second part to the trick?
Ah, but of course.
The stunning conclusion.
The vanished woman reappears, in the glory of flight.
We need to flip this trick, make it work backwards.
Yeah, reverse the reverse engineering.
Worst ways to spend a night.
I'll go put a kettle on.
Hey.
Late supper?
On a little break.
Lost in contemplation?
Yeah.
You know, when last we spoke, you were asking me about religion.
Right.
Well, at the very basic level, cosmological quantum physics suggests that if this universe here is as real as we believe that it is, it must have been cast into reality by an external observer.
God?
And yet paradoxically, how can there be anything external in an all-inclusive universe?
Uh-huh.
So, you see?
My own quest for God has always been inextricably intertwined with my work.
Does that help you sleep?
No.
It keeps me awake.
All right, so, what's the point?
The point is to keep looking for the point.
That's what the Rabbi said.
Rabbi?
Yeah.
Rabbi.
Well...
I will rejoin Charlie and Amita.
Oh, and I should do that, too.
Tough to track a woman without an identity, but I found Talma's corporation.
Two weeks ago, Aquarius Specialties Limited rented trucks to load in at the Tower of Mystery.
Now, where'd the trucks pick up from?
Movers said that they picked up two big crates in the middle of an abandoned parking lot.
Paranoid magicians.
Yeah, hoax the FBI
- I'd hide my prep, too.
Aquarius Specialties Limited also rented a storefront on Hollywood Boulevard.
It's a high traffic area, lots of tourists, entertainment seekers.
Charlie thinks there's gonna be a part two to Talma's trick
Which is why I checked into the party rental agencies in the area.
Two of them have been contracted to deliver folding chairs, tents and big screen TV's to the same location.
Come on.
"Hollywood Brasserie"?
Talma loves her misdirection.
Oh, come on, now, does it really need to be this dark?
You scared, Granger?
Nah.
Pitch-black was top of my class in "Pitchblack Assaults on Magical Illusions" back in Quantico.
Let's see.
Lights.
Thelma's not comming back from this one.
Murder?
Well, ME's initial report is inconclusive.
Talma drowned, but she has a contusion on the side of her head, too.
She also had a laceration on her right leg, pretty deep.
That explains the blood we found at the Tower of Mystery.
However she got cut, accidental or otherwise, the wound was bandaged, trace amounts of blood in the water.
She didn't bleed to death.
According to Charlie's analysis, this was the master fail-safe- it's a handle that would release the water.
Now it was broken off and wiped clean of prints, so, definitely somebody was here.
Hairline fracture in the glass could match the contusion on her head.
Yeah, I'm thinking maybe there was a struggle, and she got knocked out against the glass.
Yeah, then the killer dumped her, unconscious, in the water to drown.
All right, so they broke the handle- that's master fail-safe, so the internal ones wouldn't work.
It still doesn't answer one big question.
Who'd want to kill her?
Why can't they just build a normal machine, with everything laid out in an orderly fashion?
Function fit to form.
The magic design for the magic machine.
Let's take a break from the flying part.
You know, it's like a jigsaw puzzle.
You put together the frame pieces before trying to work the more difficult middle section.
You know she's right.
If we could just get a handle on the cylinder, we could figure out how much tensile strength is needed for these flying wires and how much for the common joints between the glass and filigree.
Uh, the glass.
That's simple.
Yeah.
The first question.
How much water can it handle?
Well, witnesses from the performance report that it was full.
Talkin' 50 cubic feet of water.
400 gallons.
Water weight 3,300 pounds.
A little over one a half tons.
Wow.
That amount of water... withstanding that kind of pressure.
You're not gonna find that kind of glass at Home Depot.
There are two factories that produce the quality of glass that Charlie says is required to create the cylinder.
Asahi Glass in Tokyo and Undverglasen in Garmisch, Germany.
Undverglasen shipped four tons of multi-ply tempered-curved glass to a Burbank warehouse last year.
Well, before she hit the fast track with Susie Weisz, she bounced around for about five years.
Why's that?
Maybe because her previous boss drowned while was on stage.
Who's the girl in the middle?
That's Drowndini's assistant.
That could be a lead.
Sister blames Talma for her brother's death.
Yeah, same MO, drowning, could fit for revenge.
That's my date.
Sarah.
Her real name is Jenny Calandro.
Can't believe your search led you to the doorstep of Gage Jones.
Impressive, Dr. Eppes.
Uh, guy's one of the legendary Artisans of the magic world.
Of course, last I knew, he was, uh, working in an abandoned ferry on Fidalgo Island in Washington.
Is all right that we just let ourselves in like this?
Oh, I called ahead.
Uh, magic awaits.
Professor Fleinhardt, if you would, please.
My pleasure.
Around here.
The guillotine!
It's a far better thing I do, than I have ever done.
The blade folds up into the trick.
Shh!
It's angles.
It's all angles.
That's all I'm saying.
Okay, let's, uh, show you another one.
How about the Kafka box?
Are you ready to metamorphosize?
Into what, a cockroach?
So this one is a false back.
He's still inside the box.
Okay, that's pretty cool.
He climbs in, Penn spins the box, engages the catch, the catch releases two mirrors.
The mirrors fold out at 45 degree angles.
You think you're looking at the back of the box, it's really just reflections.
Hey, quiet you.
Mr. Jillette.
Three guests.
From the FBI.
You're here because of the lovely and talented Miss Talma, I take it.
Well, may be a wasted trip, she's not here.
But she'll turn up in due time at a place of her choosing, for the best possible impact.
I hate to break it to you, she already turned up.
Oh, was it wondrous?
She was dead.
Real dead.
But I... just saw her.
I mean I built Aquarius.
She was found in the second part of the trick on Hollywood Boulevard.
She drowned inside.
No, couldn't have drowned.
We had too many fail-safes built in.
There was a handle on the outside that was broken off by someone else.
You know a, a girl, a former assistant
- Jenny Calandro?
Yeah,
I know Jenny.
Talma brought her around a couple times to look at Aquarius.
You got an address?
We think it may not have been an accident.
You're damn right it wasn't an accident.
If Talma's dead, she was murdered.
Hello.
Hi.
Oh, hey.
What's on?
Baseball, basketball, football, hockey.
Take your pick.
What, you got to ask?
Hockey.
That's right
So what is, uh, what is all this about you, uh, going to temple?
I went once.
Yeah, and?
Thinking I might take a class or two.
You know, I'd be more than happy to talk to you about it.
I mean, I've been to Hebrew school.
I know all the prayers.
Thanks.
We'll see how it goes.
I think I'm okay for now.
Right.
Hockey.
I know I'm still new and all, but is this status quo for you guys?
What's that?
Stalking girls on company time.
My date's home.
Jenny.
You've got to be kidding me.
You do have a way with the ladies.
You are not playing chicken with the FBI.
Yeah, she is pretty.
I didn't kill Thalma, I swear.
You blamed her for your brother's death.
You wanted revenge.
Anthony was reckless.
He didn't check his gear, his machines.
He thought that if they worked once, they always worked.
That's what killed him, and I knew that.
Oh, so it was a coincidence that you were at the show the night that Talma disappeared?
I mean, the night she was murdered.
Talma dealt with my brother's death differently.
I moved on.
She made it her life's work to court death.
I brought you to the show, because an old friend asked me to.
I was her assistant, nothing more.
You helped her out of that box?
As soon as you left, I went under the stage, removed the hatch.
Talma was covered in her own blood.
When she fell through the trap door, she hit a metal strut, tore her leg open.
No, we never found a bloody strut.
She took it, said it added to the mystery.
Look, I wanted to take her to the hospital, but she insisted she was fine.
We bandaged the leg,
I helped her to her car and she drove off on her own.
Where'd she go?
To Hollywood.
To make sure the second Aquarius was working properly.
I told you, she learned from what happened to my brother.
My job was to get back to you.
You were just supposed to be some... cop.
I could have gone up to any guy in that bar.
But I was selfish.
I went up to the right one.
Best sucker in the house.
Not what I meant.
She lying?
I doubt it.
But, hey, I'm the last guy you should ask, right?
What are you talking about?
You're the only one I can ask.
Don, send somebody else in there... to talk to her.
Well, either she's very good, or she does like you.
I believe she knew Talma.
I believe she was working with Talma that night.
And I believe there's much better ways to get payback than to sucker an FBI agent into watching you kill your target.
Yeah, I agree with you.
So what do we do with her?
She committed a crime, and she ran.
You make the call.
How much have they dismantled?
Apparently, the veneer was taken down, but the guts remain.
The guts, which are usually under the stage and lead to a panel offstage where the technician calls the shots.
These must be the fail-safe dials.
Check the glass.
All right, looks like there are two switches hidden inside the cylinder:
one high and one low.
Water release valves.
The techs indicate they've not been touched.
It's a good gument for Talma being unconscious.
She couldn't trip the fail-safes.
One, two, three input pipes.
Reconstruction of the apparatus indicates there should be at least four.
Should be six if they were playing it safe.
So to fill this cylinder with three pipes in five seconds...
Or less. would require higher water pressure than we'd anticipated, extremely high water pressure.
Where does that leave us?
All right, hey.
We don't think Talma was murdered.
No, our findings suggest that higher than intended pressure was ultimately responsible for Talma's death.
So this is all an accident?
The flaw was in the machine.
Well, how can you figure that out if you never even saw the trick being performed?
We used Design Recovery.
It was originally implemented to handle secretive computer software systems hidden within coding:
illusions, ghosts in the machine.
To a first-time viewer, a staple jt looks like a tiny piece of metal holding your papers together.
But pry it loose and study its dimensions, how it bends, you realize at some point it changed shape to achieve its goal.
Put it under a microscope and you see telltale signs it was attached to others of its kind.
Without seeing the staple's origin, we reverse engineer the unseen machine that put our tiny little piece of metal to work.
Most likely, Talma climbed in, and then someone else started Aquarius.
However, the water filled up too quickly.
She slammed her head against the glass on the inside.
Added to the blood loss, it knocked her unconscious.
Which is why she never engaged any of the security devices inside the machine.
Yeah, it doesn't explain the handle, the fracture, the other person, why they didn't let her out...
We think they tried.
They pulled the handle, but that failed.
Yeah, they tried another way: brute force.
We found this fracture in the exact structurally weakest place.
It wasn't Talma's head that cracked the glass, it was probably somebody with a sledgehammer.
So all the signs of attempted murder were actually evidence that someone tried to save her.
Yeah, and there was only one person, other than Talma, that had inside knowledge about this trick:
the man who built it.
Magicians have something against track lighting or what?
This place is a lot less threatening during the day, trust me.
Jones?
Don't make us have to come get you!
I think we got him.
What's the matter, there was no bed to hide under?
Got him.
Tried so hard to get her out.
You got to believe me.
An artisan's worst nightmare is to have a trick go wrong.
You gave us Jenny Calandro, knowing she was innocent.
Why didn't you tell us before?
I wanted to, it's just... she was out cold, laying there as the water killed her.
The fail-safes...
We know.
Her chest stopped moving.
I was inches away from her when she died.
It was an accident.
All you had to do was come forward.
Oh, and watch my entire career, my greatest invention, die with her?
Nobody buys illusions that kill you for real.
So, hmm, how was that?
Well... to be honest, Mom's was better.
Oh, come on.
It's the same recipe.
I'm just saying.
That's all, I'm just saying.
Hey, listen, Donny, um... do you feel like I cheated you out something?
We were never a religious family.
It's not about that.
I just...
I always used to know exactly what I was doing, why I was doing it, you know, what I wanted and...
I just...
I feel like I'm missing something.
So, you, um... you think, uh, you'll find it by going to temple?
I don't know.
I just know where it's not.
You know, it's not in the job.
I know, but I...
I never... taught you about, you know, God and... or gave you that choice.
No, you did.
You know, look where I'm looking for it.
Right.
So, um... that's it?
That's all I got.
I cooked, you do the dishes.
Don't look at your phone as if it's gonna ring and save you.
Just do the dishes.
This is hardly a romantic spot.
It's not a romantic spot.
It's a learning spot.
Help me with this.
Amita?
I want to show you what I see in magic.
Uh, I see a harness.
Yes.
go over there to the switchboard.
Flip switch seven.
Uh, hey, are we sure this is safe?
Well, we know the design better than anybody.
Eight.
Nine.
Ten.
Do you see it yet?
Worst.
Renaissance.
Fair.
Ever.
Please let it go, Sheldon.
It was rife with historical inaccuracies.
For example, the tavern girl serving flagons of mead.
Her costume was obviously Germanic.
But in 1487, the Bavarian purity laws, or Reinheitsgebot, severely limited the availability of mead.
At best, they would have had some sort of spiced wine.
- You're nitpicking.
- Oh, really?
Well, here's another nit for you:
the flagons would not have been made of polypropylene.
Renaissance fairs aren't about historical accuracy.
They're about taking chubby girls who work at Kinko's and lacing them up in corsets so tight their bosom jumps out and says, "Howdy."
Bosoms would not have said "howdy" in the 15th century.
If anything, they would've said, "Huzzah."
I don't care what the bosoms say.
I just want to be part of the conversation.
Hi, guys.
Looks like you've been to the renaissance fair...
I'm hoping.
Renaissance fair?
More of a medieval, slash, Age of Enlightenment, slash, any-excuse-to-wear-a-codpiece fair.
Okay, fine, whatever.
This is my friend Eric.
- Hello.
- Hey.
So, yeah, good to see you.
It's good to see you, too.
We should probably go.
Bye, guys.
I like your hat.
Thanks, my mom made it.
Penny with a new guy, très awkward.
It wasn't awkward.
It wasn't fun.
Besides, what's the big deal?
We dated, we stopped dating, and now we're both moving on.
By moving on, do you mean she's going out with other men and you spent the afternoon making 15th-century soap with Wolowitz?
That was not 15th century soap.
My God, those people need to learn you can't just put "ye olde" in front of anything you want and expect to get away with it.
Can we please just go in?
My chain mail's stuck in my underwear.
You're wearing modern underwear?
Relatively modern.
What are you wearing?
I fashioned historically accurate undergarments out of linen.
You bought linen?
Don't be silly...
I borrowed one of your pillowcases.
Borrowed?
I'm happy that Penny's moving on.
It gives me the freedom to move on myself.
Are you saying that you've been holding back?
Of course.
Out of respect.
So, how do you explain the ten years before Penny?
Who were you respecting then?
Well, I've dated plenty of women.
There was Joyce Kim...
Leslie Winkle...
Notify the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary.
The word "plenty" has been redefined to mean "two."
What about that girl last year at Comic-Con?
- Doesn't count.
- Why not?
What happens in costume at Comic-Con stays at Comic-Con.
You're saying that because of what happened to you.
- What happened to you?
- Nothing happened to me.
It wasn't your fault.
He was dressed as a green Orion slave girl.
How did we get on me?
!
We were mocking Leonard for not moving on.
Dude, you have totally not moved on.
Yes, I have.
It's just a matter of actually making a date with someone.
Like who?
Well... there's Joyce Kim.
But she defected back to North Korea, so... it's a little geographically undesirable.
- What about Leslie Winkle?
- Oh, no.
- Why?
- Her research methodology is sloppy, she's unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity, and to make matters worse, she's often mean to me.
- I think she's smoking hot.
- I'd hit that.
You'd hit particulate soil in a colloidal suspension.
Mud.
I like Leslie, but she's not interested in dating as much as using men as tools for stress release.
Yeah, so?
Be a tool.
Go get yourself a little rebound "stress release."
Technically, it would only be rebound if he and Penny had actually engaged in physical intimacy.
Like you and Richard the slave girl?
I bought him dinner and we kissed once!
That was it.
And he told me his name was Kimberly.
You know how I know we're not in the matrix?
How?
If we were, the food would be better.
Hey, Leonard.
- Hey, Leslie.
- Hey, dummy.
Hello, to you... insufficiently intelligent person.
Ooh, rush me to the burn unit.
Do you have a second?
I need to ask you something.
- Sure.
- If you'll excuse me,
I'm going to go do work that promises significant results, as opposed to what you do... which does not.
Yeah, you heard me.
So, I heard your relationship with Penny crashed to the ground like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory.
Where did you hear that?
Actually, I read it.
Wolowitz texted me.
"Like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory," yeah.
I thought it was a pretty good one.
I gave him an LOL.
Anyway, it got me thinking.
Now that you're unattached, maybe we can revisit our previous attachment.
Are you suggesting another bout of stress release?
No, I'm all done with casual sex.
From now on, I'm fully committed to the traditional relationship paradigm.
- Really?
What changed?
- It's hard to say.
I guess there's a time in every woman's life when she gets tired of waking up on a strange futon with a bunch of people she doesn't know.
Yeah, I can see how that would-- a bunch of people?
Anyway, I figure it's time to slow things down and, who better to slow things down with than you?
I'm flattered.
So, how do you suggest we proceed?
Your place, we'll order Chinese, you'll rent a movie-- artsy, but accessible-- then light petting, no coitus.
Sounds fun.
I'll leave the details up to you.
It's better if you assume the male role.
Thank you, that's very thoughtful.
Great.
Call me.
Great news.
My mom sent me my old Nintendo 64.
- Terrific.
- You know what this means, don't you?
Break out the Red Bull, it's time to rock Mario, old school.
- I kind of have other plans tonight.
- But it's Friday.
Friday's always vintage game night.
Look, Mom included the memory card.
We can pick up right where I left off in 1999 when I had pernicious anemia.
The thing is, someone's coming over.
No problem.
I have three controllers.
The more the merrier.
It's a date.
I have a date coming over.
You can't blame me for not jumping to that conclusion.
Why?
What's so unusual about me having a date?
- Statistically speaking...
- All right, all right.
Nevertheless, I have one now and I'd appreciate it if you would, make yourself scarce.
I'm a published theoretical physicist with two doctorates and an IQ which can't be accurely measured by normal tests.
How much scarcer could I be?
You know what I mean.
Could you just give us a little privacy?
- You want me to leave the apartment?
- Yes.
You mean, just go someplace else and be... someplace else?
Yes.
Why should I leave?
This is my apartment, too.
I know, and if science ever discovers a second member of your species and you two would like some privacy,
I'd be more than happy to get out of your way.
Well, all right then.
What are you doing?
Playing Super Mario on a poorly coded Nintendo 64 emulator.
Why are you doing it on the stairs?
I am a modern day Napoleon exiled to the Elba of the staircase because Leonard, get this, has a date.
Good for him.
Why are you sitting here?
Why don't you just go to a movie or something?
Alone?
- Yeah, why not?
- What if I choke on my popcorn?
Who will administer the Heimlich maneuver?
Then don't order popcorn.
No popcorn at the mo...
listen to yourself.
- Why don't you go to a coffee shop?
- I don't drink coffee.
They have other things.
What do they have?
You know, cookies, pastries...
Pastries such as bear claws?
- Yeah, sure.
- I don't like bear claws.
Hey, Penny.
Dumbass.
Leslie Winkle.
Of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world, why does it have to be Leslie Winkle?
They have a lot in common.
I mean, they're both scientists.
Oh, please.
The only way she could make a contribution to science would be if they resumed sending chimps into space.
Okay, well, I have a date, too, so I'll see ya.
Everybody has a date.
Even you, Mario, going after Princess Peach.
And what am I doing?
I'm just enabling you.
- This is pretty good orange chicken.
- Yeah, it's from Chang's.
- Not Chow's?
- No, Chang's.
- What happened to Chow's?
- It changed.
So, how many children do you think we should have?
I'm sorry.
That was a little abrupt.
A little?
There are so many things to talk about before we discuss reproduction.
I sure hope so.
Besides shortness, what genetic weaknesses run in your family?
Sorry to interrupt.
Battery's dying.
Continue.
Genetic weakness, right.
There's the lactose intolerance.
Don't forget the male-pattern baldness.
When his uncles sit around the dinner table, they look like a half carton of eggs.
Okay, my uncles are bald, but my Aunt Edna is one of the hairiest women you'll ever meet.
Sweet lady.
Always tickles when she hugs me.
- What now?
- I have to make pee-pee.
I'm sorry about all of Sheldon's interruptions.
He can be a bit of an eccentric.
If by "eccentric" you mean passive-aggressive
East Texas blowhole, I agree.
I think tonight was a very good start.
Me, too.
You sure you're okay postponing intercourse until our relationship is past the initial viability test?
No problem, I'm very skilled at postponing intercourse.
I guess I'll call you and we'll arrange another evening.
I believe protocol dictates you wait a minimum of 18 hours before you call so I'm not repulsed by your cloying eagerness.
Sure.
Again, it's your decision.
You're the man.
It wasn't my cat.
It was an experiment designed by this guy named Schroedinger.
From the Charlie Brown cartoons?
No, he was some kind of scientist.
Let me start again.
- Hey, Leonard.
- Hello.
- Leslie.
- Hi.
Okay, well... good night.
Okay, good night.
That ain't gonna make your point.
That's enough.
Call me.
Right.
Okay, good night.
- What?
- Had a great time.
Ciao.
I'm sorry, I am not going back to the Renaissance fair.
Come on, there's so few places I can wear my jester costume.
I don't care.
There are far too many historical anomalies for my comfort.
Okay, how about this?
You can go dressed as a Star Trek science officer exploring a planet similar to Earth in the 1500s.
You mean, like Spock?
Sure.
Fascinating.
Hey, fellow scientists...
Why don't we all move over there so Leslie can join us?
Let's do it.
If you're having trouble deciding where to sit, may I suggest one potato, two potato?
Or as I call it, "the Leslie Winkle experimental methodology."
- Don't make this hard for me.
- It's not hard.
It's simple.
You can either sit with me, your friend, colleague and roommate or with an overrated scientist you might have sex with.
You're right, it is simple.
- Hey, Sheldon.
- Penny.
Third floor tonight...
mixing it up?
I still don't understand why you don't go to dinner or something.
All right, let's say I go to dinner alone, and during the meal, I have to use the restroom.
How do I know someone's not touching my food?
Good night, Sheldon.
Penny, hold on.
Are you sure things can't work out with you and Leonard?
Excuse me?
I'm just wondering if you really gave it the old college try.
Or in your case, the old community college try.
Okay, where is this coming from?
Leonard is upstairs right now with my archenemy.
Your archenemy?
The Dr. Doom to my Mr. Fantastic.
The Dr. Octopus to my Spider-Man, the Dr. Sivana to my Captain Marvel.
I get it.
It's amazing how many supervillains have advanced degrees.
Graduate school should do a better job of screening those people out.
Sheldon, come back.
You're losing me.
It's Leslie Winkle, Penny.
She belittles my research.
Sweetie, I'm sorry.
She called me "dumbass."
I know.
I heard.
Given this situation,
I have no choice but to withdraw my previous objections to your ill-considered relationship with Leonard.
Gee, well, thank you for that.
But I think for now,
Leonard and I are just gonna stay friends.
No, that response is unacceptable to me.
Sheldon, you are a smart guy...
I'm "smart"?
I'd have to lose 60 IQ points to be classified as "smart."
- Are you gonna let me talk?
- I'm sorry.
You must know that if Leonard and Leslie want to be together, nothing you can do is gonna stop it.
You continue to underestimate my capabilities, madam.
Let me put it this way.
If you're really Leonard's friend, you will support him no matter who he wants to be with.
Wait a minute.
Why am I doing all the giving here?
If Leonard's really my friend, why doesn't he have to support me and my hatred of Leslie Winkle?
Because love trumps hate.
Now you're just making stuff up.
Okay, good night, Sheldon.
Mario...
If only I could control everyone the way I control you.
Hop, you little plumber, hop, hop, hop.
When the two of you reach a natural stopping point,
I'd like to have a word.
If the word is "pee-pee," just do it.
Leonard, you're my friend, and friends support their friends... apparently.
So I'm withdrawing my objection to your desire to have a relationship with Leslie.
- Thank you.
- I will graciously overlook the fact that she is an arrogant, subpar scientist who actually believes loop quantum gravity better unites quantum mechanics with general relativity than does string theory.
You kids have fun.
Hang on a second.
Loop quantum gravity clearly offers more testable predictions than string theory.
I'm listening.
Amuse me.
For one thing, we expect quantized space-time to manifest itself as minute differences in the speed of light for different colors.
Balderdash.
Matter clearly consists of tiny strings.
Are you gonna let him talk to me like that?
Okay, well, there is a lot of merit to both theories.
No, there isn't.
Only loop quantum gravity calculates the entropy of black holes.
Sheldon, don't make that noise.
It's disrespectful.
I should hope so.
It was a snort of derision.
You agree with me, right?
Loop quantum gravity is the future of physics.
Sorry, Leslie, I guess I prefer my space stringy, not loopy.
I'm glad I found out the truth about you before this went any further.
Truth?
What truth?
We're talking about untested hypothes.
It's no big deal.
It isn't?
Really?
Tell me, how will we raise the children?
I guess we wait until they're old enough and let them choose their own theory.
We can't let them choose.
They're children!
Where are you going?
I'm sorry.
I could have accepted our kids being genetically unable to eat ice cream or ever get a good view of a parade.
But this?
This is a deal breaker.
Look on the bright side.
What's the bright side?
Only nine more months to Comic-con.
Captain, I'm getting an unusual reading.
That's great.
You guys want corn dogs?
That's a temporal anomaly.
Corn dog's didn't come into existence till the first half of the 20th century.
Worst.
Renaissance.
Fair.
Ever.
Please let it go, Sheldon.
It was rife with historical inaccuracies.
For example, the tavern girl serving flagons of mead.
Her costume was obviously Germanic.
But in 1487, the Bavarian purity laws, or Reinheitsgebot, severely limited the availability of mead.
At best, they would have had some sort of spiced wine.
- You're nitpicking.
- Oh, really?
Well, here's another nit for you:
the flagons would not have been made of polypropylene.
Renaissance fairs aren't about historical accuracy.
They're about taking chubby girls who work at Kinko's and lacing them up in corsets so tight their bosom jumps out and says, "Howdy."
Bosoms would not have said "howdy" in the 15th century.
If anything, they would've said, "Huzzah."
I don't care what the bosoms say.
I just want to be part of the conversation.
Hi, guys.
Looks like you've been to the renaissance fair...
I'm hoping.
Renaissance fair?
More of a medieval, slash, Age of Enlightenment, slash, any-excuse-to-wear-a-codpiece fair.
Okay, fine, whatever.
This is my friend Eric.
- Hello.
- Hey.
So, yeah, good to see you.
It's good to see you, too.
We should probably go.
Bye, guys.
I like your hat.
Thanks, my mom made it.
Penny with a new guy, très awkward.
It wasn't awkward.
It wasn't fun.
Besides, what's the big deal?
We dated, we stopped dating, and now we're both moving on.
By moving on, do you mean she's going out with other men and you spent the afternoon making 15th-century soap with Wolowitz?
That was not 15th century soap.
My God, those people need to learn you can't just put "ye olde" in front of anything you want and expect to get away with it.
Can we please just go in?
My chain mail's stuck in my underwear.
You're wearing modern underwear?
Relatively modern.
What are you wearing?
I fashioned historically accurate undergarments out of linen.
You bought linen?
Don't be silly...
I borrowed one of your pillowcases.
Borrowed?
I'm happy that Penny's moving on.
It gives me the freedom to move on myself.
Are you saying that you've been holding back?
Of course.
Out of respect.
So, how do you explain the ten years before Penny?
Who were you respecting then?
Well, I've dated plenty of women.
There was Joyce Kim...
Leslie Winkle...
Notify the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary.
The word "plenty" has been redefined to mean "two."
What about that girl last year at Comic-Con?
- Doesn't count.
- Why not?
What happens in costume at Comic-Con stays at Comic-Con.
You're saying that because of what happened to you.
- What happened to you?
- Nothing happened to me.
It wasn't your fault.
He was dressed as a green Orion slave girl.
How did we get on me?
!
We were mocking Leonard for not moving on.
Dude, you have totally not moved on.
Yes, I have.
It's just a matter of actually making a date with someone.
Like who?
Well... there's Joyce Kim.
But she defected back to North Korea, so... it's a little geographically undesirable.
- What about Leslie Winkle?
- Oh, no.
- Why?
- Her research methodology is sloppy, she's unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity, and to make matters worse, she's often mean to me.
- I think she's smoking hot.
- I'd hit that.
You'd hit particulate soil in a colloidal suspension.
Mud.
I like Leslie, but she's not interested in dating as much as using men as tools for stress release.
Yeah, so?
Be a tool.
Go get yourself a little rebound "stress release."
Technically, it would only be rebound if he and Penny had actually engaged in physical intimacy.
Like you and Richard the slave girl?
I bought him dinner and we kissed once!
That was it.
And he told me his name was Kimberly.
You know how I know we're not in the matrix?
How?
If we were, the food would be better.
Hey, Leonard.
- Hey, Leslie.
- Hey, dummy.
Hello, to you... insufficiently intelligent person.
Ooh, rush me to the burn unit.
Do you have a second?
I need to ask you something.
- Sure.
- If you'll excuse me,
I'm going to go do work that promises significant results, as opposed to what you do... which does not.
Yeah, you heard me.
So, I heard your relationship with Penny crashed to the ground like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory.
Where did you hear that?
Actually, I read it.
Wolowitz texted me.
"Like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory," yeah.
I thought it was a pretty good one.
I gave him an LOL.
Anyway, it got me thinking.
Now that you're unattached, maybe we can revisit our previous attachment.
Are you suggesting another bout of stress release?
No, I'm all done with casual sex.
From now on, I'm fully committed to the traditional relationship paradigm.
- Really?
What changed?
- It's hard to say.
I guess there's a time in every woman's life when she gets tired of waking up on a strange futon with a bunch of people she doesn't know.
Yeah, I can see how that would-- a bunch of people?
Anyway, I figure it's time to slow things down and, who better to slow things down with than you?
I'm flattered.
So, how do you suggest we proceed?
Your place, we'll order Chinese, you'll rent a movie-- artsy, but accessible-- then light petting, no coitus.
Sounds fun.
I'll leave the details up to you.
It's better if you assume the male role.
Thank you, that's very thoughtful.
Great.
Call me.
Great news.
My mom sent me my old Nintendo 64.
- Terrific.
- You know what this means, don't you?
Break out the Red Bull, it's time to rock Mario, old school.
- I kind of have other plans tonight.
- But it's Friday.
Friday's always vintage game night.
Look, Mom included the memory card.
We can pick up right where I left off in 1999 when I had pernicious anemia.
The thing is, someone's coming over.
No problem.
I have three controllers.
The more the merrier.
It's a date.
I have a date coming over.
You can't blame me for not jumping to that conclusion.
Why?
What's so unusual about me having a date?
- Statistically speaking...
- All right, all right.
Nevertheless, I have one now and I'd appreciate it if you would, make yourself scarce.
I'm a published theoretical physicist with two doctorates and an IQ which can't be accurely measured by normal tests.
How much scarcer could I be?
You know what I mean.
Could you just give us a little privacy?
- You want me to leave the apartment?
- Yes.
You mean, just go someplace else and be... someplace else?
Yes.
Why should I leave?
This is my apartment, too.
I know, and if science ever discovers a second member of your species and you two would like some privacy,
I'd be more than happy to get out of your way.
Well, all right then.
What are you doing?
Playing Super Mario on a poorly coded Nintendo 64 emulator.
Why are you doing it on the stairs?
I am a modern day Napoleon exiled to the Elba of the staircase because Leonard, get this, has a date.
Good for him.
Why are you sitting here?
Why don't you just go to a movie or something?
Alone?
- Yeah, why not?
- What if I choke on my popcorn?
Who will administer the Heimlich maneuver?
Then don't order popcorn.
No popcorn at the mo...
listen to yourself.
- Why don't you go to a coffee shop?
- I don't drink coffee.
They have other things.
What do they have?
You know, cookies, pastries...
Pastries such as bear claws?
- Yeah, sure.
- I don't like bear claws.
Hey, Penny.
Dumbass.
Leslie Winkle.
Of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world, why does it have to be Leslie Winkle?
They have a lot in common.
I mean, they're both scientists.
Oh, please.
The only way she could make a contribution to science would be if they resumed sending chimps into space.
Okay, well, I have a date, too, so I'll see ya.
Everybody has a date.
Even you, Mario, going after Princess Peach.
And what am I doing?
I'm just enabling you.
- This is pretty good orange chicken.
- Yeah, it's from Chang's.
- Not Chow's?
- No, Chang's.
- What happened to Chow's?
- It changed.
So, how many children do you think we should have?
I'm sorry.
That was a little abrupt.
A little?
There are so many things to talk about before we discuss reproduction.
I sure hope so.
Besides shortness, what genetic weaknesses run in your family?
Sorry to interrupt.
Battery's dying.
Continue.
Genetic weakness, right.
There's the lactose intolerance.
Don't forget the male-pattern baldness.
When his uncles sit around the dinner table, they look like a half carton of eggs.
Okay, my uncles are bald, but my Aunt Edna is one of the hairiest women you'll ever meet.
Sweet lady.
Always tickles when she hugs me.
- What now?
- I have to make pee-pee.
I'm sorry about all of Sheldon's interruptions.
He can be a bit of an eccentric.
If by "eccentric" you mean passive-aggressive
East Texas blowhole, I agree.
I think tonight was a very good start.
Me, too.
You sure you're okay postponing intercourse until our relationship is past the initial viability test?
No problem, I'm very skilled at postponing intercourse.
I guess I'll call you and we'll arrange another evening.
I believe protocol dictates you wait a minimum of 18 hours before you call so I'm not repulsed by your cloying eagerness.
Sure.
Again, it's your decision.
You're the man.
It wasn't my cat.
It was an experiment designed by this guy named Schroedinger.
From the Charlie Brown cartoons?
No, he was some kind of scientist.
Let me start again.
- Hey, Leonard.
- Hello.
- Leslie.
- Hi.
Okay, well... good night.
Okay, good night.
That ain't gonna make your point.
That's enough.
Call me.
Right.
Okay, good night.
- What?
- Had a great time.
Ciao.
I'm sorry, I am not going back to the Renaissance fair.
Come on, there's so few places I can wear my jester costume.
I don't care.
There are far too many historical anomalies for my comfort.
Okay, how about this?
You can go dressed as a Star Trek science officer exploring a planet similar to Earth in the 1500s.
You mean, like Spock?
Sure.
Fascinating.
Hey, fellow scientists...
Why don't we all move over there so Leslie can join us?
Let's do it.

Penny, hold on.
Are you sure things can't work out with you and Leonard?
Excuse me?
I'm just wondering if you really gave it the old college try.
Or in your case, the old community college try.
Okay, where is this coming from?
Leonard is upstairs right now with my archenemy.
Your archenemy?
The Dr. Doom to my Mr. Fantastic.
The Dr. Octopus to my Spider-Man, the Dr. Sivana to my Captain Marvel.
I get it.
It's amazing how many supervillains have advanced degrees.
Graduate school should do a better job of screening those people out.
Sheldon, come back.
You're losing me.
It's Leslie Winkle, Penny.
She belittles my research.
Sweetie, I'm sorry.

Look, I like Leslie, but she's not interested in dating as much as using men as tools for stress release.

You know how I know we're not in the Matrix?

Hello to you, insufficiently intelligent person.
Ooh, rush me to the Burn Unit.
Do you have a second?
I need to ask you something.
- Yeah, sure.
- Well, if you'll excuse me I'm going to go do work that promises significant results as opposed to what you do, which does not.
Yeah, you heard me.
Wow.
So I heard your relationship with Penny crashed to the ground like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory.
- Where'd you hear that?

Wolowitz texted me.
"Like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory," yep.
Yeah, I thought it was a pretty good one.

Anyway, it got me thinking.
Now that you're unattached, maybe we can revisit our previous attachment.
Are you suggesting another bout of stress release?
No, I'm all done with casual sex.
I'm fully committed to the traditional relationship paradigm.
Really?
What changed?
There's just a time in every woman's life when she gets tired of waking up on a futon with a bunch of people she doesn't know.
Yeah, I can see how that would-- A bunch of people?
Anyway, I just figure it's time to slow things down and who better to slow things down with than you?
I'm flattered.
So how do you suggest we proceed?
Your place.
We'll order Chinese.
You'll rent a movie, artsy but accessible.
Then light petting, no coitus.
- Sounds fun.
- I'll leave the details up to you.
I think it's better if you assume the male role.
Thank you, that's very thoughtful.
Great.
Call me.
Hey, great news.
My mom sent me my old Nintendo 64.
Oh.
- Terrific.
- You know what this means, don't you?
Break out the Red Bull.
It's time to rock "Mario" old school.
- I kind of have other plans tonight.
- But it's Friday.
Friday's always vintage-game night.
Look, Mom included the memory card.
We can pick up right where I left off in 1999 when I had pernicious anemia.
The thing is, someone's coming over.
Well, no problem.
I have three controllers.
The more the merrier.
Sheldon, it's a date.
I have a date coming over.
Oh.
Well, you can't blame me for not jumping to that conclusion.
Why?
What's so unusual about me having a date?
- Well, statistically speaking--
- All right, all right.
Nevertheless, I have one now and I'd appreciate it if you would, you know, make yourself scarce.
I am a published theoretical physicist with two doctorates and an IQ which can't be measured by normal tests.
How much scarcer could I be?
You know what I mean.
Could you just give us a little privacy?
- You want me to leave the apartment?
- Yes.
You mean just go someplace else and be someplace else?
- Yes.
- But why should I leave?
- This is my apartment too.
- I know it is.
If science ever discovers a second member of your species and you two would like some privacy, I'd be happy to get out of your way.
Well, all right, then.
Sheldon?
What are you doing?
Playing "Super Mario" on a poorly coded Nintendo 64 emulator.
But why are you doing it on the stairs?
I am a modern-day Napoleon exiled to the Elba of the staircase because Leonard, get this, has a date.
Oh.
Oh, well, good for him.
Yeah, but why are you sitting here?
Why don't you go to a movie or something?
Alone?
- Yeah, why not?
- What if I choke on my popcorn?
Who will administer the Heimlich maneuver?
- Then don't order popcorn.
- No popcorn at the mov--?
Listen to yourself.
- Why don't you go to a coffee shop?
- I don't drink coffee.
They have other things.
- What do they have?
- I don't know.
You know, cookies, pastries--
- Pastries such as bear claws?
- Yeah, sure.
I don't like bear claws.
Hey, Penny.
Dumb-ass.
Leslie Winkle.
Of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world why does it have to be Leslie Winkle?
Well, they have a lot in common.
I mean, they're both scientists.
Please.
The only way she could make a contribution to science would be if they resumed sending chimps into space.
Okay, well, I have a date too, so I'll see you.
Everybody has a date.
Even you, Mario, going after Princess Peach.
And what am I doing?
I'm just enabling you.
- This is pretty good orange chicken.
- Yeah, it's from Chang's.
- Not Chow's?
- No, Chang's.
- What happened to Chow's?
- It changed.
So how many children do you think we should have?
I'm sorry, that was a little abrupt.
A little.
There are so many things to talk about before reproduction.
I sure hope so.
Besides shortness, what genetic weaknesses run in your family?
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Battery's dying.
Continue.
Uh, genetic weaknesses, right.
Um, there's the lactose intolerance.
Don't forget the male-pattern baldness.
When his uncles sit around the dinner table, they look like a half-carton of eggs.
Okay, yeah, my uncles are bald but my Aunt Edna is one of the hairiest women you'll ever meet, so, you know....
Sweet lady.
It always tickles when she hugs me.
- What now?
- I have to make pee-pee.
I'm sorry about all of Sheldon's interruptions.
He can be a bit of an eccentric.
If by "eccentric" you mean "passive-aggressive East Texas blowhole," I agree.
Well, I think tonight was a very good start.
Me too.
You're sure you're okay postponing intercourse until our relationship is past the initial viability test?
No problem.
I'm very skilled at postponing intercourse.
I guess I'll call you and we'll arrange another evening.
I believe protocol dictates that you wait a minimum of 18 hours before you call so I'm not repulsed by your cloying eagerness.
- Sure.
- Again, it's your decision.
You're the man.
No, it wasn't my cat.
It was an experiment designed by this guy named Schrödinger.
From the Charlie Brown cartoons?
No, he was some kind of scientist.
Let me start again.
- Oh, hey, Leonard.
- Hello.
- Leslie.
- Hi.
Okay, well, good night.
Okay, well, good night.
That ain't gonna make your point.
Okay, okay, that's enough.
Call me.
Right.
Well, okay, good night.
- What?
- Had a great time.
Ciao.
I'm sorry, I am not going back to the Renaissance fair.
Come on, Sheldon.
There are so few places I can wear my jester costume.
I don't care.
There are far too many historical anomalies for my comfort.
Oh, okay, how about this?
You can go dressed as a Star Trek science officer exploring a planet similar to Earth in the 1500s.
You mean like Spock?
Sure.
Fascinating.
- Hey, fellow scientists.
Sheldon.
- Mm.
Why don't we move there so Leslie can join us?
Yeah, let's do it.
If you're having trouble deciding where to sit I suggest One Potato, Two Potato or as I call it, the Leslie Winkle Experimental Methodology.
- Don't make this hard for me.
- It's not hard.
It's simple.
You can either sit with me, your friend, colleague and roommate or you can sit with an overrated scientist you might have sex with.
You're right, it is simple.
- Hey, Sheldon.
- Penny.
Third floor tonight.
Mixing it up?
Oh.
I still don't understand why you don't just go to dinner.
All right, let's say I go to dinner alone and during the meal I have to use the restroom.
How do I know someone's not touching my food?
Good night, Sheldon.
Penny, hold on.
You sure things can't work out with you and Leonard?
Excuse me?
I'm just wondering if you really gave it the old college try.
Or in your case, the old community-college try.
Okay, where is this coming from?
Leonard is upstairs right now with my archenemy.
- Your archenemy?
- Yes, the Dr. Doom to my Mr. Fantastic.
The Dr. Octopus to my Spider-Man.
- The Dr. Sivana to my Captain Marvel--
- Okay, I get it, I get it, I get it.
It's amazing how many super villains have advanced degrees.
Graduate schools should do a better job of screening those people out.
Sheldon, come back.
You're losing me.
It's Leslie Winkle, Penny.
She belittles my research.
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.
She called me "dumb-ass."
I know, I heard.
Given the situation I have no choice but to withdraw my previous objections to your ill-considered relationship with Leonard.
Oh, gee, well, thank you for that.
But, um, I think for now Leonard and I are just gonna stay friends.
No.
That response is unacceptable to me.
- You are a smart guy.
You must know--
- I'm smart?
I'd have to lose 60 IQ points to be classified as "smart."
- Are you gonna let me talk?
- I'm sorry.
You must know that if Leonard and Leslie wanna be together nothing you can do is gonna stop it.
You continue to underestimate my capabilities, madam.
Okay, let me put it this way.
If you're Leonard's friend you will support him no matter who he wants to be with.
Wait a minute.
Why am I doing all the giving here?
If Leonard's really my friend why doesn't he have to support me in my hatred of Leslie Winkle?
Because love trumps hate.
Oh, now you're just making stuff up.
Okay.
Good night, Sheldon.
Oh, Mario.
If only I could control everyone the way I control you.
Hop, you little plumber, hop, hop, hop.
When the two of you reach a natural stopping point, I'd like to have a word.
If the word is "pee-pee," just do it.
Leonard, you're my friend and friends support their friends, apparently.
So I am withdrawing my objection to your desire to have a relationship with Leslie.
- Thank you.
- I will graciously overlook the fact that she is an arrogant, subpar scientist who believes loop quantum gravity better unites quantum mechanics with general relativity than does string theory.
You kids have fun.
Hang on a second.
Loop quantum gravity clearly offers more testable predictions than string theory.
I'm listening.
Amuse me.
Okay, well, for one thing, we expect quantized space-time to manifest as minute differences in the speed of light for different colors.
Balderdash.
Matter clearly consists of tiny strings.
Are you gonna let him talk to me like that?
Okay, well, there is a lot of merit to both theories.
No, there isn't.
Only loop quantum gravity calculates the entropy of black holes.
Sheldon, don't make that noise.
It's disrespectful.
I should hope so.
It was a snort of derision.
You agree with me, right?
Loop quantum gravity is the future of physics.
Sorry, Leslie, I guess I prefer my space stringy, not loopy.
Well, I'm glad I found out the truth about you before this went any further.
Truth?
What truth?
We're talking about untested hypotheses-- Look, it's no big deal.
Oh, it isn't?
Really?
Tell me, Leonard, how will we raise the children?
I guess we wait until they're old enough and let them choose their own theory.
We can't let them choose, Leonard, they're children.
Wait, where are you going?
I'm sorry.
I could've accepted our kids being genetically unable to eat ice cream or ever get a good view of a parade.
But this?
This is a deal breaker.
Look on the bright side.
- What's the bright side?
- Only nine more months to Comic-Con.
Oh, yeah.
Captain, I'm getting an unusual reading.
Yeah, that's great.
You guys want corn dogs?
Yeah.
That's a temporal anomaly.
Corn dogs didn't come into existence till the first half of the 20th century.
Best watched using Open Subtitles MKV Player
Worst Renaissance fair ever.
Please let it go, Sheldon.
SHELDON:
It was rife with historical inaccuracies.
For example, the tavern girl serving flagons of mead.
Now, her costume was obviously Germanic but in 1487, the Bavarian purity laws, or Reinheitsgebot severely limited the availability of mead.
At best, they would've had some spiced wine.
LEONARD:
You're nitpicking.
SHELDON:
Oh, really?
Well, here's another nit for you.
The flagons would not have been made of polypropylene.
Renaissance fairs aren't about historical accuracy.
They're about taking chubby girls who work at Kinko's and lacing them up in corsets so tight their bosom jumps out and says, "Howdy."
Bosoms would not have said, "Howdy," in the 15th century.
If anything, they would've said, "Huzzah."
I don't care what the bosoms say, Sheldon.
I just wanna be part of the conversation.
Hi, guys.
Looks like you've been to the Renaissance fair.
I'm hoping.
Renaissance fair?
More of a medieval-slash- Age of Enlightenment slash- any-excuse-to-wear-a-codpiece fair.
Okay, fine, whatever.
Um, you guys, this is my friend Eric.
- Hello.
ERIC:
Hey.
So, yeah, good to see you.
Yeah.
Yeah, it's good to see you too.
- We should probably go.
- Yeah.
- Bye, guys.
- Like your hat.
Thanks, my mom made it.
Penny with a new guy.
Très awkward.
It wasn't awkward.
It wasn't fun.
Besides, what's the big deal?
We dated, we stopped dating, and now we're both moving on.
By "moving on," you mean she's going out with other men and you spend the afternoon making 15th-century soap with Wolowitz?
That was not 15th-century soap.
My god, those people need to learn you can't just put "ye olde" in front of anything you want and expect to get away with it.
Can we please just go in?
My chain mail's stuck in my underwear.
You're wearing modern underwear?
Relatively modern.
What are you wearing?
I fashioned historically accurate undergarments out of linen.
You went and bought linen?
Don't be silly.
I borrowed one of your pillowcases.
Borrowed?
You know, I'm happy that Penny's moving on.
It gives me freedom to move on myself.
Are you saying that you've been holding back?
Of course.
Out of respect.
So how do you explain the 10 years before Penny?
Who were you respecting then?
What?
I've dated plenty of women.
There was, uh, Joyce Kim, Leslie Winkle...
Notify the editors of the Oxford English Dictionary:
The word "plenty" has been redefined to mean "two."
What about that girl last year at Comic-Con?
- It doesn't count.
- Why not?
What happens in costume at Comic-Con stays at Comic-Con.
You're only saying that because of what happened.
- What happened to you?
- Nothing happened to me.
It wasn't your fault, Raj.
He was dressed as a green Orion slave girl.
How did we get on me?
We were mocking Leonard.
- Dude, you have totally not moved on.
- Yes, I have.
It's just a matter of actually making a date with someone.
- Like who?
- Well, there's Joyce Kim.
But she defected back to North Korea so it's a little geographically undesirable.
- What about Leslie Winkle?
- Oh, no.
- Why?
- Her research methodology is sloppy she's unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity and to make matters worse, she's often mean to me.
- I think she's smoking hot.
- I'd hit that.
You'd hit particulate soil in a colloidal suspension.
Mud.
Look, I like Leslie, but she's not interested in dating as much as using men as tools for stress release.
Yeah?
So?
Be a tool.
Go get yourself a little rebound stress release.
It would only be rebound if he and Penny had actually engaged in physical intimacy.
You mean like you and Richard the slave girl?
I bought him dinner and we kissed once.
That was it.
And he told me his name was Kimberly.
You know how I know we're not in the Matrix?
How?
If we were, the food would be better.
Hey, Leonard.
- Hey, Leslie.
- Hey, dummy.
Hello to you, insufficiently intelligent person.
Ooh, rush me to the Burn Unit.
Do you have a second?
I need to ask you something.
- Yeah, sure.
- Well, if you'll excuse me I'm going to go do work that promises significant results as opposed to what you do, which does not.
Yeah, you heard me.
Wow.
So I heard your relationship with Penny crashed to the ground like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory.
- Where'd you hear that?
- Actually, I read it.
Wolowitz texted me.
"Like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory," yep.
Yeah, I thought it was a pretty good one.
I gave him an "LOL."
Anyway, it got me thinking.
Now that you're unattached, maybe we can revisit our previous attachment.
Are you suggesting another bout of stress release?
No, I'm all done with casual sex.
I'm fully committed to the traditional relationship paradigm.
Really?
What changed?
There's just a time in every woman's life when she gets tired of waking up on a futon with a bunch of people she doesn't know.
Yeah, I can see how that would...
A bunch of people?
Anyway, I just figure it's time to slow things down and who better to slow things down with than you?
I'm flattered.
So how do you suggest we proceed?
Your place.
We'll order Chinese.
You'll rent a movie, artsy but accessible.
Then light petting, no coitus.
- Sounds fun.
- I'll leave the details up to you.
I think it's better if you assume the male role.
Thank you, that's very thoughtful.
Great.
Call me.
Hey, great news.
My mom sent me my old Nintendo 64.
LEONARD:
Oh.
- Terrific.
- You know what this means, don't you?
Break out the Red Bull.
It's time to rock "Mario" old school.
- I kind of have other plans tonight.
- But it's Friday.
Friday's always vintage-game night.
Look, Mom included the memory card.
We can pick up right where I left off in 1999 when I had pernicious anemia.
The thing is, someone's coming over.
Well, no problem.
I have three controllers.
The more the merrier.
Sheldon, it's a date.
I have a date coming over.
Oh.
Well, you can't blame me for not jumping to that conclusion.
Why?
What's so unusual about me having a date?
- Well, statistically speaking...
- All right, all right.
Nevertheless, I have one now and I'd appreciate it if you would, you know, make yourself scarce.
I am a published theoretical physicist with two doctorates and an IQ which can't be measured by normal tests.
How much scarcer could I be?
You know what I mean.
Could you just give us a little privacy?
- You want me to leave the apartment?
- Yes.
You mean just go someplace else and be someplace else?
- Yes.
- But why should I leave?
- This is my apartment too.
- I know it is.
If science ever discovers a second member of your species and you two would like some privacy, I'd be happy to get out of your way.
Well, all right, then.
Sheldon?
What are you doing?
Playing "Super Mario" on a poorly coded Nintendo 64 emulator.
But why are you doing it on the stairs?
I am a modern-day Napoleon exiled to the Elba of the staircase because Leonard, get this, has a date.
Oh.
Oh, well, good for him.
Yeah, but why are you sitting here?
Why don't you go to a movie or something?
Alone?
- Yeah, why not?
- What if I choke on my popcorn?
Who will administer the Heimlich maneuver?
- Then don't order popcorn.
- No popcorn at the mov...?
Listen to yourself.
- Why don't you go to a coffee shop?
- I don't drink coffee.
They have other things.
- What do they have?
- I don't know.
You know, cookies, pastries...
- Pastries such as bear claws?
- Yeah, sure.
I don't like bear claws.
Hey, Penny.
Dumb-ass.
Leslie Winkle.
Of all the overrated physicists in all the labs in all the world why does it have to be Leslie Winkle?
Well, they have a lot in common.

- What now?
- I have to make pee-pee.
I'm sorry about all of Sheldon's interruptions.

Okay, well, good night.

Okay, okay, that's enough.
Call me.
Right.
[DOOR CLOSES]
Well, okay, good night.
- What?
- Had a great time.
Ciao.
I'm sorry, I am not going back to the Renaissance fair.
Come on, Sheldon.
There are so few places I can wear my jester costume.
I don't care.
There are far too many historical anomalies for my comfort.

I'm hoping.
Renaissance fair?
More of a medieval, slash, age of enlightenment,
Slash, any-excuse- to-wear-a-codpiece fair.
Okay, fine, whatever.
You guys, this is my friend eric.
So, yeah, good to see you.
It's good to see you, too.
We should probably go.
Bye, guys.
I like your hat.
Thanks, my mom made it.
Penny with a new guy, tres awkward.
It wasn't awkward.
It wasn't fun.
Besides, what's the big deal?
We dated, we stopped dating, and now we're both moving on.
By moving on,
Do you mean she's going out with other men
And you spent the afternoon
Making 15th-century soap with wolowitz?
That was not 15th century soap.
My god, those people need to learn

We were mocking leonard for not moving on.
Dude, you have totally not moved on.
Yes, I have.
It's just a matter of actually making
A date with someone. like who?
Well... there's joyce kim.
But she defected back to north korea,
So that's a little geographically undesirable.
What about leslie winkle?
Oh, no. why?
Her research methodology is sloppy,
She's unjustifiably arrogant about loop quantum gravity,
And to make matters worse, she's often mean to me.
I think she's smoking hot.
I'd hit that.
You'd hit particulate soil

Go get yourself a little rebound "stress release."

Had actually engaged in physical intimacy.
You mean like you and richard the slave girl?
I bought him dinner and we kissed once!
That was it.
And he told me his name was kimberly.
You know how I know we're not in the matrix?
How?
If we were, the food would be better.
Hey, Leonard.
Hey, Leslie.
Hey, dummy.
Hello, to you...
Insufficiently intelligent person.
Ooh, rush me to the burn unit.
Hey, Leonard, do you have a second?
-I need to ask you something. -sure.
Well, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to go do work that promises
Significant results, as opposed to what you do...
Which does not.
Yeah, you heard me.
So, I heard your relationship with Penny crashed to the ground
Like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory.
Where did you hear that?
Actually, I read it.
Wolowitz texted me.
"like blue ice falling out of an airplane lavatory," yeah.
I thought it was a pretty good one.
I gave him an lol.
Anyway, it got me thinking.
Now that you're unattached,
Maybe we can revisit our previous attachment.
Are you suggesting another bout of stress release?
No, I'm all done with casual sex.
From now on, I'm fully committed
To the traditional relationship paradigm.
Really?
what changed?
It's hard to say.
I guess there's just a time in every woman's life
When she gets tired of waking up on a strange futon
With a bunch of people she doesn't know.
Yeah, I can see how that would-- a bunch of people?
Anyway, I figure it's time to slow things down
And who better to slow things down with than you?
Oh...
I'm flattered.
So how do you suggest we proceed?
Your place, we'll order chinese, you'll rent a movie--
Artsy, but accessible-- then light petting, no coitus.
Sounds fun.
I'll leave the details up to you.
I think it's better if you assume the male role.
Thank you, that's very thoughtful.
Great.
Call me.
Great news.
My mom sent me my old nintendo 64.
-Terrific -you know what this means, don't you?
Break out the red bull,
It's time to rock mario, old school.
I kind of have other plans tonight.
But it's friday.
Friday's always vintage game night.
Look, mom included the memory card.
We can pick up right where I left off in 1999
When I had pernicious anemia.
Well, the thing is, someone's coming over.
Okay, no problem.
I have three controllers.
The more the merrier.
Sheldon, it's a date.
I have a date coming over.
Well, you can't blame me for not jumping to that conclusion.
Why?
what's so unusual about me having a date?
Well, statistically speaking...
All right, all right.
Well, nevertheles, I have one now
And I'd appreciate it if you would, you know,
Make yourself scarce.
Leonard, I'm a published theoretical physicist
With two doctorates and an iq
Which can't be accurely measured by normal tests.
How much scarcer could I be?
You know what I mean.
Could you just give us a little privacy?
-You want me to leave the apartment?
-yes.
You mean, just go someplace else and be...
Someplace else?
Yes.
Well, why should I leave?
this is my apartment, too.
I know it is, and if science ever discovers a second member
Of your species and you two would like some privacy,
I'd be more than happy to get out of your way.
Well, all right then.
Sheldon, what are you doing?
Playing super mario on a poorly coded
Nintendo 64 emulator.
Yeah, but why are you doing it on the stairs?
I am a modern day napoleon
Exiled to the elba of the staircase
Because Leonard, get this, has a date.
Oh. oh, well, good for him.
Yeah, but why are you sitting here?
Why don't you just go to a movie or something?
Alone?
Yeah, why not?
What if I choke on my popcorn?
Who will administer the heimlich maneuver?
Well, then don't order popcorn.
No popcorn at the mov...
listen to yourself.
Why don't you go to a coffee shop?
I don't drink coffee.
They have other things.
What do they have?
I don't know. you know, cookies, pastries...
-Pastries such as bear claws?
-Yeah, sure.
I don't like bear claws.
Hey, penny.
Dumbass.
Leslie winkle.
Of all the overrated physicists
In all the labs in all the world,
Why does it have to be leslie winkle?
Well, they have a lot in common.
I mean, they're both scientists.
Oh, please. the only way she could make
A contribution to science would be
If they resumed sending chimps into space.
Okay, well, I have a date, too,
So I'll see ya.
Everybody has a date.
Even you, mario, going after princess peach.
And what am I doing?
I'm just enabling you.
Yeah, it's from chang's.
Not chow's?
no, chang's.
What happened to chow's?
It changed.
So, how many children do you think we should have?
I'm sorry. that was a little abrupt.
A little?
I mean, there are so many things to talk about
Before we discuss reproduction.
I sure hope so.
Besides shortness,
What genetic weaknesses run in your family?
Sorry to interrupt.
Battery's dying. continue.
Uh, genetic weakness, right.
Uh, there's the lactose intolerance.
Don't forget the male-pattern baldness.
When his uncles sit around the dinner table,
They look like a half carton of eggs.
Okay, yeah, my uncles are bald, but my aunt edna
Is one of the hairiest women you'll ever meet, so...
Sweet lady.
Always tickles when she hugs me.
What now?
I have to make pee-pee.
Listen, I'm sorry about all of sheldon's interruptions.
He can be a bit of an eccentric.
If by "eccentric" you mean passive-aggressive
East texas blowhole, I agree.
I think tonight was a very good start.
Me, too.
Are you sure you're okay postponing intercourse
Until our relationship is past the initial viability test?
No, problem.
I'm very skilled at postponing intercourse.
I guess I'll call you
And we'll arrange another evening.
Yes, I believe protocol dictates that you wait a minimum
Of 18 hours before you call
So I'm not repulsed by your cloying eagerness.
Sure.
Again, it's your decision. you're the man.
It wasn't my cat.
It was an experiment
Designed by this guy named schroedinger.
From the charlie brown cartoons?
No, he was some kind of scientist.
Let me start again.
Oh, hey, leonard.
Hello.
Leslie.
Hi.
Okay, well, good night.
Okay, well, good night.
That ain't gonna make your point.
That's enough.
Call me.
Right.
Okay, good night.
Uh, what?
Had a great time. ciao.
I'm sorry, I am not going back to the renaissance fair.
Come on, sheldon.
There's so few places I can wear my jester costume.
I don't care. there are far too many historical anomalies
For my comfort.
Okay, how about this?
You can go dressed as a star trek science officer
Exploring a planet similar to earth in the 1500s.
You mean, like spock?
Sure.
Fascinating.
Hey, fellow scientists...
Sheldon.
Why don't we all move over there so leslie can join us?
Yeah, let's do it.
If you're having trouble deciding where to sit,
May I suggest one potato, two potato?
Or as I call it,
"the leslie winkle experimental methodology."
Don't make this hard for me.
It's not hard.
It's simple. you can either sit with me,
Your friend, colleague and roommate
Or you can sit with an overrated scientist
You might have sex with.
You're right, it is simple.
Hey, sheldon.
Penny.
Third floor tonight-- mixing it up?
I still don't understand why
You don't just go to dinner or something.
All right,
Let's say I go to dinner alone,
And during the meal, I have to use the restroom.
How do I know someone's not touching my food?
Good night, sheldon.
Penny, hold on.
Are you sure things can't work out with you and leonard?
Excuse me?
I'm just wondering
If you really gave it the old college try.
Or in your case, the old community college try.
Okay, where is this coming from?
Leonard is upstairs right now with my archenemy.
Your archenemy?
Yes, the dr. doom to my mr. fantastic.
Dr. octopus to my spider-man,
The dr. sivana to my captain marvel.
I get it, I get it, I get it.
Do you know, it's amazing how many supervillains
Have advanced degrees.
Graduate school should probably do a better job
Of screening those people out.
Sheldon, come back. you're losing me.
It's leslie winkle, penny.
She belittles my research.
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.
She called me "dumbass."
I know.
I heard.
Given this situation, I have no choice
But to withdraw my previous objections
To your ill-considered relationship with leonard.
Oh, gee, well, thank you for that.
But I think for now,
Leonard and I are just gonna stay friends.
No, that response is unacceptable to me.
Sheldon, you are a smart guy.
You must know...
I'm "smart"?
I'd have to lose 60 iq points to be classified as "smart."
Are you gonna let me talk?
I'm sorry.
You must know that if leonard and leslie want to be together,
Nothing you can do is gonna stop it.
You continue to underestimate my capabilities, madam.
Okay, let me put it this way.
If you're really leonard's friend, you will support him
No matter who he wants to be with.
Wait a minute.
Why am I doing all the giving here?
If leonard's really my friend,
Why doesn't he have to support me
An my hatred of leslie winkle?
Because love trumps hate.
Oh, now you're just making stuff up.
Okay, good night, sheldon.
Oh, mario, if only I could control everyone
The way I control you.
Hop, you little plumber, hop, hop, hop.
When the two of you reach a natural stopping point,
I'd like to have a word.
The word is "pee-pee." just do it.
Leonard, you're my friend,
And friends support their friends...
Apparently.
So I'm withdrawing my objection to your desire
To have a relationship with leslie.
Thank you.
I will graciously
Overlook the fact that she is an arrogant,
Subpar scientist who actually believes loop quantum gravity
Better unites quantum mechanics with generally relativity
Than does string theory.
You kids have fun.
Hang on a second.
Loop quantum gravity clearly offers more testable predictions
Than string theory.
I'm listening. amuse me.
Okay, well, for one thing, we expect quantized space-time
To manifest itself as minute differences
In the speed of light for different colors.
Balderdash. matter clearly consists of tiny strings.
Are you gonna let him talk to me like that?
Okay, well, there is a lot of merit to both theories.
No, there isn't. only loop quantum gravity
Calculates the entropy of black holes.
Sheldon, don't make that noise. it's disrespectful.
I should hope so.
It was a snort of derision.
You agree with me, right?
Loop quantum gravity is the future of physics.
Sorry, leslie, I guess I prefer my space stringy, not loopy.
I'm glad I found out the truth about you
Before this went any further.
Truth?
what truth?
We're talking about untested hypotheses.
It's no big deal.
It isn't?
really?
Tell me, leonard, how will we raise the children?
I...
I guess we wait until they're old enough
And let them choose their own theory.
We can't let them choose, leonard. they're children!
Wait. where are you going?
I'm sorry.
I could have accepted our kids being
Genetically unable to eat ice cream
Or ever get a good view of a parade.
But this?
This is a deal breaker.
-Look on the bright side.
-What's the bright side?
Only nine more months to comic-con.
Oh, yeah.
Captain, I'm getting an unusual reading.
Yeah, that's great.
You guys want a corn dog?
Yeah.
That's a temporal anomaly.
Corn dog's didn't come into existence
Till the first half of the 20th century.
Hello?
Bobo, where are you?
I'm near Neway.
You haven't gone upstairs yet?
Then just go home and sleep it off.
No, I really want to go.
Don't make a fool out of yourself.
I really miss him.
How about you wait for me,
I'll go upstairs with you!
No, it's okay.
You don't sound okay.
I'm fine.
I'll call you later.
Gotta go.
Bye.
Bobo...
Hello?
Bobo, how was it?
Nevermind!
Bobo!
Mon, it's busy out there, come on!
Okay!
That table wants a bucket of Bud.
Okay.
Here's the beer!
Are you sure there's enough to drink?
How about another bucket?
Okay?
Two buckets...
Okay, souvenirs for you.
Thank you... be right back.
Beware of your boyfriend!
Congratulations...
Come on, I want to thank you for helping me.
I'm in a hurry.
I have a date tonight.
Come in for a manicure...
You asked me to buy you something to eat.
And you are cheating on me?
How nice of you.
No...
I'm not cheating!
I've been waiting for you!
Have fun!
Mon!
Don't be angry.
We're finished!
What?
I said I didn't cheat on you!
I was waiting for you.
Forget it!
We're finished!
Mon, you say we're finished all the time.
I am serious this time!
Mon!
Stop following me!
Mandy, Mandy!
Let go!
You're hurting me!
Have you finished screaming?
No!
Have you finished with the other girl?
What are you talking about?
That mainland chick.
The one who... called you "baby" just now!
You listened to my calls?
You've checked my messages too.
It's very fair, Mr Li.
What do you want?
I don't want to see you again!
Get lost!
I pay the rent for the shop,
I'm not going anywhere!
You can have it.
What?
Love watching a scene?
Move!
Sorry.
Hey!
Closed for the day.
Thank you, boss.
Thank you.
Get back to work.
I flown back specially for this,
Why is the shop closed?
So annoying!
Boss.
Boss, you don't recognize me?
I am Cousin.
I used to come all the time.
Boss, why is the shop close?
What's the good news?
Boss, are you pregnant?
No.
Where's your boyfriend?
Boss, can you open up for me?
I'm leaving tomorrow.
I am not the boss!
The shop is not mine!
Not anymore!
Bobo.
It's Kiki.
I sat behind you since prep school.
Where have you been?
Long time no see.
Long time no see.
You can speak Cantonese, I'm okay with it.
How do you know I'm here?
I saw you in a magazine, so I came to pay you a visit.
He's my boyfriend, Michael.
- Hi.
- Hi!
Sorry.
We got a table.
Sit here.
Bobo, you have quite a business.
It's only small.
Kiki, you've gone missing since grade 7.
Where have you been?
Taiwan.
Taiwan?
Have you forgotten my mom is Taiwanese?
A rumour in school said your family had gone bankrupt.
Bankrupt?
Quite the opposite.
My dad became rich.
From the lottery, 30 millions.
Then there were no reason to leave.
My dad did business with the money.
But after the financial crisis, we lost everything.
Good luck is just the beginning of a nightmare.
So I only trust myself.
That's so pessimistic,
You can trust me.
Men, is the last thing I'll trust.
Here comes my boyfriend.
Chun.
He wants to be an actor.
Awesome.
This is Michael's first visit to Hong Kong.
First visit?
Try some more, our dessert is very famous.
What is this?
Mango mix.
Delicious?
What did I say?
Your boyfriend is so cute.
Bobo!
- Bobo!
- Kiki?
Michael dumped me.
Why are you so drunk?
Sit down first...
Bobo, what's all the noise?
Kiki's been dumped and she's drunk.
I'm so good to him!
- It's OK...
What should we do now?
Take her home.
Me?
- No. 32, Lobster Bay!
- I got it.
I am not the boss!
Hey!
Why are you calling me?
I lost my mobile.
What has it got to do with me?
I wonder if you have seen it.
Of course not.
But I left it in the shop.
It was there before you came last night.
Are you saying I took it?
No, that's not what I meant.
I'm just asking if you have seen it.
Listen, we've split up already.
Don't find excuses to call me.
Go to hell!
Mon!
Mon...
He really didn't dare to cheat!
Why is weirdo Queeny treating us for lunch?
She is so stingy.
I've heard, she wants us to meet her fiance.
What?
Fi... what?
Husband to be!
She is going to get married next month.
Someone wants her?
Bobo, why are you so quiet?
I am fine.
Let's move then.
I am hungry.
Why are you three so late?
I've been waiting for you and I have ordered dim sum.
Sorry.
Let me... introduce my fiance.
He is my fiance
- Henry.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Hi, have I met you before?
Impossible!
Henry was born in England.
Just came back for work.
What does he do?
I am a Financial Controller.
He's got a great... job!
Queeny has made a good catch.
I have only been back 3 months.
Shouldn't have met you.
Maybe I have got it wrong.
Of course you have.
Henry barely knows Chinese.
All his Cantonese has been taught by me.
No offense, how would he know girls of your class?
She called that no offense?
She might as well have sworn.
You must be thinking... how Henry and I met.
Let's order first.
Right.
Let's order.
- Great.
- My Chinese is not good.
Let me order.
Baby, don't order spicy food.
I got it, Sweetie.
What do you want to eat?
I want to eat you, Sweetie.
I want to puke.
Hey.
Hey, how much is it?
It's new.
Nine hundred.
I'll pay more for this one.
Why so late, come on.
Big news.
What is it?
Queeny committed suicide last night.
What!
Did she die?
Luckily, still alive.
The boss just called, she visited Queeny.
She can't come to work for a few days.
Did she say why Queeny committed suicide?
Rumor has it that her fiance had scammed her money.
And he just disappeared.
I knew something was fishy about that guy.
Have I met you before?
Sweetie.
You want to call that fat bitch?
If you tell on me, I'll hunt you down.
I... won't...
Don't tell that fat bitch you've seen me, okay?
Hey!
What?
Are you good at scamming people?
I received Kiki's email.
And there's a link to her blog.
Who is it?
So mysterious.
There's a video too.
No wonder she didn't need me for her birthday.
Is it ready?
Count to three then open your eyes!
Did you make a wish?
Let's show yourself.
Happy birthday, Honey!
Thank you, baby.
Baby, kiss me.
- Are you happy?
- Yeah, very happy!
No. 32, Lobster Bay!
Sit tight.
Michael, I really love you.
Don't leave me.
I'm not Michael, I am Chun.
Sit tight, okay?
Hey!
Fasten your seat belt...
I really love you.
Chun...
I love you.
Hello?
Kiki?
Bobo.
You scared me to death, are you okay?
I'm fine.
Luckily, Chun took me back...
I was so worry about you two.
- Where is Chun?
- Chun...
Where is he?
Bobo, sorry.
Why are you apologizing?
I puked all over the floor.
He's cleaning up after me.
He deserves this.
Kiki, never drink so much again
I'll worry about you.
I got it.
He's back, I'll let you talk to him.
Thanks, Kiki.
Hello?
How was it?
Cleaning up after my friend's mess.
It's OK.
Bobo, I will be back soon.
Talk later.
Bye.
What?
Don't.
What took you so long?
I am busy.
Have dinner tonight.
I told you I'm going to Bobo's.
Why?
It's her mom's birthday.
When will you tell her?
You said you don't love her anymore.
Say something.
How about I tell her...
I'll see you tonight.
Okay, I will wait for you.
Got to go.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
Kiki let me found out they are together on purpose.
She is so sly!
She thought of this way to push me out!
Have you finished your story?
You met me today.
And I have listened to your rant.
I'll call that even.
See you.
I'll pay you.
To scam Kiki for me
I want to revenge!
How much?
Name your price.
200 thousands.
200 thousands?
I don't have that much.
How about 150 thousands?
I don't have that.
Then how are you going to revenge?
Maybe you can buy a knife to kill her, that's cheap.
100 thousands.
I can pay you 100 thousands at most.
Let's finish the drinks.
How will you pay?
Give me some time.
I can get the money.
2 days.
2 days?
!
Nevermind.
Okay!
I will have it!
Give me your number.
I will call you.
Are you nuts!
What if you call the cops?
I won't.
I give you two days, 7 p.m. Wah Fu playground.
What if you don't show up?
Who's begging here?
Just concentrate on getting the money.
Cheer up,
I've bought you a new mobile.
Thank you.
I'm not upset anymore, let's eat!
Come on, I'm hungry.
Drop off the things and dine with me.
Don't!
Just go home.
I really want to go.
Don't make a fool out of yourself.
I really miss him.
Bobo.
I didn't think you would come.
How's my Cantonese?
Chun taught me.
Did he?
Chun said you wouldn't come.
I said you're a forgiving person.
It's been a long time.
How have you been these days, still good?
I just came to say happy birthday to Chun.
Don't leave yet,
We've waited for you to cut the cake.
Where is Chun?
Baby, look who has come?
Bobo, long time no see.
Long time no see.
I'll let you catch up.
Baby, I'll check if the cake is ready.
Happy birthday.
Thank you.
How are you lately?
Okay.
I called you but no one answered.
Did you need me for something?
Nothing... just wanted to know how you are.
You still have time for me?
Thanks.
Why don't you open it?
Yes.
Baby, my best friend is here, come and say hi.
Okay.
Bobo...
Sorry, Bobo, don't go yet.
Have some cake before you go.
Crystal, my boyfriend.
- Hello, happy birthday.
- Hi.
Do you know who she is?
No.
She's Kiki's boyfriend's ex-girlfriend.
Did she came for a fight?
What with?
Madame, hello
I am the customer service officer Swipe.
How may I help you?
Please come with me.
Can I borrow money from here?
Honestly... we sell wanton noodles here.
Are you nuts?
Can't you read our sign?
Just leave!
No...
I come to borrow money.
How much do you want?
100 thousands.
100 thousands?
Did you bring tax, salary, rent, water rate, electric, gas...
IDD, internet, mobile phone statements... job references, residential proof,
ID card...
Copies, etc?
Yes, I have them all here.
Good girl!
You are quite sincere.
Yes, I really need the money.
What is it for?
I need to say?
Of course.
If you use the money to kill someone... or become... a drug dealer...
We are accomplices, what if we are caught?
What should we say?
I'm guilty!
Idiot!
Do I have to?
Nah, I can take a guess.
You wouldn't get it right.
It's just a game.
Your dad needs money to pay off loan sharks?
Your brother defalcated money?
Your sister is a shopaholic, needs to pay back debts?
It isn't one of our top three reasons?
Impossible, what is it...
Don't tell me, let me guess...
I want to revenge!
I need the money to revenge!
You make me laugh!
Tell me.
A few days ago, I met a conman.
He said if I give him 100 thousands...
He will scam the woman who stole my boyfriend.
I see.
It's all worth it right?
Did you call the police?
The police can revenge for me?
Tell the police to catch the conman.
Why do all of you think I have a problem?
You are fine.
You are cute, you are stupid...
A cute idiot!
"Police Chat" has shown so many times already...
You're still being scam, idiot!
What if he's not scamming me?
What if he really can scam that woman for me?
Well, he is a conman.
An old thousand, you know?
But he's being pay by me to scam someone else.
We won't lend you money.
I am sorry.
I beg you.
I am really sorry.
Have you ever had your heart broken?
Have you ever found your best friend... stealing your boyfriend?
She had it planned!
She planned to steal my shop... the first day she turned up.
She is right.
I can trust no one.
I can only rely on myself.
I trusted Kiki too much.
I trusted my boyfriend too much.
I put him on the taxi with my own hand.
I handed her over to Kiki.
I've had this birthday card with me... since the day he dumped me.
It is the first birthday card...
Chun gave me.
After we split up...
I look at it everyday.
He told me, I am his "My Favorites".
But it turns out, his honest words... is just a big lie.
I am not his "My Favorites".
I'm like the "My Favorites"
On computers, one out of many.
Deleted when out of favor.
Even if I'm being scammed, I will not regret it.
It's a gamble I'm willing to take.
Pay back on time.
Thank you.
But rules are rules.
I'll have your dad defalcated money as reason.
It'll be easier for me.
Hey,
Where's the money?
100 thousands.
Awesome.
You really got it.
When will you start to scam Kiki?
You can't rush these things.
I need to plan.
When will that be?
Give me your phone number.
I have a big deal this week.
I will call you after that.
What if you don't call me?
What if you run away...
Will you shut up!
If you don't trust me, you can find someone else.
No...
Call me, I'll wait.
That's right.
Relax.
Just wait for my call.
Where have you been for the past few days?
Come and save me!
Wai locks the doors and windows.
I couldn't find the key.
What?
What are you two up to?
I said I won't let him go to do business in the mainland... and fighting.
Hey, I can see you!
Me?
Look up.
Can you see me?
How is it?
It's double locked.
What now?
I'll knock down the door.
Stand back.
Look at you.
Eating like a child.
Slow down.
I am really hungry.
Hello?
No, not my turn yet.
Will you come back tonight?
You'll be back.
I'll cook for you.
Okay, bye.
Hello?
I'm buying lunch.
Not my turn yet.
You're off early tonight?
Great.
What do you want to eat?
I'll cook for you.
See you tonight, bye.
What do you want?
Rice with pig knuckles.
There's only one box left.
It's okay.
I'll have rice with spam and egg instead.
Rice with spam and egg for one.
Hey.
Let's share.
It's okay, you eat some.
I can't finish this much.
But you have nothing left.
It's good to share.
Have we met before?
You are 58.
What 58?
I am 30. 3 stores behind yours.
No wonder you look so familiar.
Why have you never said hello to me?
We've only just met.
Eat some more.
I've got enough.
You like pig knuckles.
You don't like it?
I don't actually like pig knuckles.
And you queue up?
You're weird.
I was just following the crowd.
It must be good if you need to queue up.
Here.
You have a piece of spam then.
And half an egg...
Hey?
Where are you going?
I'm coming to pick you up from work.
Don't.
What is it now?
It's Elaine's birthday.
We plan to go to karaoke.
I'll come with you.
As if!
It's ladies night, guys are not welcome.
Then what will I do?
I'll give you a night off.
- But don't put a foot wrong.
- I won't dare...
Elaine's calling.
See you, bye.
Okay.
Bye.
Hey, went to the suppliers?
Yeah, new arrivals.
How can you carry so much?
I've got you.
Do you think the new clothes are pretty?
Yeah.
Come on, there's still a lot.
Can you give me a hand.
Hold my waist, you want me to fall down?
Be careful.
You look silly.
Someone's here.
Hey?
What is it?
Late night snack?
Okay, where?
Okay, I'll come now.
He's gone.
How does he treat you?
Why do you ask?
Is there nothing else to talk about?
Just curious.
Well... how does she treat you?
Now you ask me.
He is a stock agent. 10 years older than me.
He gave me the money to open this shop.
He said with a shop,
I wouldn't go out and meet guys.
I really do like him.
I've turned down men... who are better than him.
How does your sister treat you?
She is only older than me by a few months.
She treats me very well...
Only she has bad temper.
As long as you can stand her.
Hey... do you think I'm useless?
I'm actually jealous... she has got such a good boyfriend.
Really?
How about... you become my boyfriend too?
What?
No?
How about your own boyfriend?
He's too busy to have time for me.
So you want me... to be your backup?
Why not?
I'll be your backup lover too.
If your girlfriend is busy, I will be with you.
I don't mind.
Do you?
Since we are backups, we can only see each other when our own partner is busy.
So the initiative is on our partners.
What about birthdays and festivals?
It's fine.
We can celebrate earlier.
For example, we can celebrate Christmas Eve a week early.
Sounds like so much fun.
Are you learning Mandarin?
Yes.
Wai, my boyfriend.
Said he will take me to...
Shanghai on my birthday.
I have been learning for a long time.
Then how is it?
I "live" you.
It should be I "like" you.
Let's say:
I love you.
How can you say "I love you" when... you can't even say "I like you"?
I love you.
Say I like you first.
Step by step, okay?
Let me off.
No!
Come again!
I like you!
One more time!
I like you!
I like you!
I like you!
Bingo!
Bingo!
Bingo!
Once more...
These are the rules for backup lovers:
Dating schedule is agreed by both parties.
The backup lover should conduct oneself.
Backup will always be backup.
The identity will be a top secret.
It's for you.
What is it?
Open it.
So cute.
This is 17th December.
According to our contract, we should celebrate Christmas Eve... a week early.
This is our first Christmas Eve Together.
You remembered?
Merry Christmas.
Hey
What's the rush, have you got a plan to scam Kiki?
We are going inside.
Don't say a word without my consent.
Inside?
What for?
How come you have so many questions?
Just be smart.
880 thousands for this necklace is reasonable.
I'm sure my daughter will like it.
Yes, Mrs Wong.
Will you visit your daughter... in LA this year?
God
She said she will go skiing this Christmas.
Really?
Mrs Wong, should I carve...
"To my dear daughter,"
"Janet Wong, happy birthday!"?
Both necklaces need "From mommy", okay?
- Okay, no problem.
- Thanks.
- Not at all.
- Auntie Wong?
I am Owen.
Janet's classmate.
We met in LA... last summer.
Really?
Yes, Janet always says...
Her mom is so pretty and young you look more like her sister.
She is such a sweet heart to me.
Auntie, I'm so glad to bump into you here.
Me too.
- Hello.
- You're on your own?
No, my girlfriend and I came back for Christmas.
She is pretty.
Don't praise her.
She is just a silly sally.
Hi, I am Owen Chan.
I ordered a ring two days ago.
Can you check for me if it is ready or not?
- Okay, please wait a moment.
- Thank you.
Auntie, when will Janet come back?
Next week.
Next week?
I will leave in a couple of days
I miss her again.
Auntie, could you do me a favor?
What is it?
When I skied with her last year,
I accidentally broke my ski.
Janet is so nice that... she insisted on buying me a new one.
I want to pay her back.
It's nothing, it's okay.
No!
I don't like owing people money.
You are such a earnest youngster.
But I've only got US dollars.
That's too much!
Right, Janet's birthday is coming.
Maybe you can... choose a present for her.
As a birthday gift from me.
Then...
Okay.
Thank you.
Welcome.
Sir, I have checked for you.
But I can't find your order.
Can you double check for me?
- Okay, please wait.
- Thank you.
- Auntie, I am going to get married.
- Really?
- Yes.
- When?
I plan to propose later.
I've even booked a table.
So romantic.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
I plan to have the wedding next year.
You must come with Janet.
No problem.
I have your words.
Sir, do you mind giving me your ID... or credit card to check?
I'm so sorry.
I was robbed yesterday.
I lost both my ID and credit card.
I already told that silly Sally.
We are in Hong Kong not L.A.
And should keep her eyes on our belongings.
Sir, which is the design you like?
Let me check if we have it in stock.
Right.
Take a look.
That one!
We have that in stock.
I will take it then.
Okay?
Let me give you a cheque.
Sorry, Sir.
We don't accept cheque.
Then I will pay by US dollars.
Sorry, Sir.
I want to help you but this is our company...
Madam, I beg you.
This ring means a lot to me.
I plan to propose with it.
I will leave the day after tomorrow.
And it's my girlfriend's birthday today.
I beg you.
Please do me a favor.
I'm so sorry.
I'd like to help.
But this is our policy.
I beg you, Miss.
Just this once, please.
This ring means the world to me
I'm so sorry.
Owen,
This ring, I'll pay for you first.
No, how could I, Auntie?
Why not?
Your wallet was stolen, keep some money with you.
I will pay for your ring...
And you write me a cheque.
You are Janet's friend, of course I trust you!
Auntie.
It's okay...
Pack this ring.
Hurry up.
I got to check my teeth in Shenzhen.
If I have toothache,
I will complain to your Boss!
It's alright.
Bye-bye, Auntie.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
You know her?
Only just met.
I saw her giving you money.
E226You scammed again?
They are counterfeits.
How did you scam her?
I'll show you something.
It's beautiful!
Can you do an ending for me?
What ending?
Youngsters these days are so passionate.
But the feeling is so sweet.
You have gone too far!
You asked me out, to take advantage of me.
I am helping you.
Help!
You are just toying with me!
Just in time.
What's in time?
Bobo.
What a coincidence?
Right.
Coincidence?
You know I work here?
I...
Who is this?
I am Henry.
Hello.
Your boyfriend?
You are Bobo's friend, right?
Nice to meet you.
You have good eyes for men.
No, I'm the lucky one to have Bobo.
I will let you two get on with it.
I've got a meeting.
Okay, Kiki.
Send my regards to Chun.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Have you finished?
You knew she works here?
Just doing what I was paid for.
So, feeling any better now you've shown off to her?
A little bit.
Hey!
Why did you scam that lady?
What?
There was time,
That's it for the day.
Thanks.
See you.
See you?
Right.
I have to do more planning.
Call you later.
I won't let go of you.
I will follow you wherever you go.
You said we are going to eat.
Why are we here?
You know her?
What?
I thought you are hungry, let's go.
What do you want today?
The usual.
Give me a bottle of cognac!
Be right back.
We're drinking?
You're heart broken and depressed.
Drinks can make it better.
Cognac, good stuff, cheers.
Hey...
Enough...
Have to down it if your glass is up.
Who said that?
Simon.
Simon?
Never heard Simon said that.
Cheers!
Hurry up.
Cheers.
- Finished!
- Come again!
- What the hell!
- The glass is still up.
The glass is down this time.
Come on, why are you so slow?
The glass is off the table again.
You got to drink 3 glasses each time.
Why?
Have you ever heard of "3 cheers"?
Yes.
Drink then!
Be quick...
Drink more!
Yes!
Bye.
Where are we drinking next?
Drink?
Just go to bed.
Don't leave me behind.
Jeez.
They said you are scamming me.
But I didn't agree.
You said you will help me.
You said you will revenge for me.
You need to keep your words.
Keeping the promise you made.
I trust you!
I trust you.
I trust you.
Hey, she got this drunk?
I'll give you 200 bucks to take her home.
I'll give you 200 more to piss off!
I don't know her.
You don't know her?
I saw you what you did with... your "Three cheers"
You deal with your own problem.
Drink!
Drink again.
Kid, drink with me!
Drink... drink!
It's this way.
This way.
Let me tell you... a big secret.
What?
I drank quite a lot.
Mom!
How long have you known my daughter?
Not very long.
Then why did you take her out to drink?
She wasn't happy.
I've already told her not to drink so much.
My daughter hasn't been happy for a year.
Don't you want her to be happy?
It's okay, auntie.
I promise you, Bobo will be happy soon.
That'll be great.
My daughter only looks like a tough person.
It'll hurt a lot if she meets another jerk.
What's your name?
I am Keung.
Have some tea.
Thank you.
Yo!
Brother!
Have you forgotten your bro?
Look at you, all dress up, must be quite well off.
Where have you been these days?
The night club in Dongguan has closed.
So I came back and see if anything else is on.
I've counted you in for a business.
Remember this chick?
Stop acting.
You scammed 100 thousands from her last year.
She is with a big shot gangster.
"Tall Man".
Going to get married next month.
What has it got to do with me?
Some bros and I are planning to kidnap her.
That's why we need you to... give her a call.
You know I am not into this stuff.
It's just a call.
It's nothing to you.
We won't bother you again.
Don't push me, if we are still bros.
Just think about it.
How did you buy tickets?
We were behind two bitches.
They answered everything...
Brad Pitt said.
And when Matt Damon talked, she answered for George Clooney
God,
I was not there to listen to them.
It's not my fault
I didn't know... they would be in front of us.
You are useless
I hate everything you do.
You've ruined my Christmas Eve.
Hey, Honey, where is my present?
How come I can't logon?
Wrong password.
Wrong?
I've changed the password.
Move up.
Why?
I can't type the password in.
You can just tell me.
Then what's the point of me changing the password.
Come again?
From now on, I'll logon for you when you need to.
Come on!
It's my computer!
What's your problem?
Is there something I can't see on your computer?
What?
This is my computer.
Why can't I own a password?
I won't tell you the password.
Beg me, ask me, when you need to logon.
You freak!
I'm your boyfriend, not your slave!
Why don't you just put a chain round me!
You shouting at me?
Let's break up.
Fine!
Come again!
Break up?
Fine!
Now!
I don't want to anymore.
Let me tell you, I'm in control of you.
In every single way I like!
Never mind, I'll give you the password.
You don't get it, we're not compatible
I should have agreed to break up with you the first time.
Fung, don't be mad.
You keep saying how your ex being bad to you.
But the both of you are no different!
Control freaks who never care about others' feelings!
Can you stop talking about him?
Mon, there are things you need to face.
Don't talk about him!
No!
- Mon...
- Stop!
Just break up...
Just go, and never come back again!
Your present is in your room.
Just leave!
I said leave!
BBB Calling
I got to stay at home tonight.
Enjoy yourselves.
Bye.
Who is it?
Jason asked us to go out and celebrate.
Why don't we go?
You always complain I have no time for you.
I'm handing myself over to you.
Let's have a trip during Valentine's Day.
I've never seen snow before.
It's boring to celebrate festivals at home all the time.
Okay.
You say that every time.
Then you need to work.
I'll take a shower.
- Why are you calling me?
- Mandy
I miss you.
I'm outside your house, can you come out and see me?
I told you we can't see each other today.
Why?
Mandy, I forgot my towels, can you get one for me?
Coming!
- Mandy...
- Bye.
Mandy.
Hey!
Stop it!
I only sneaked out since Wai's asleep.
Call a taxi.
Go home.
I won't.
I want to be with you.
You are with me...
Just not tonight.
Mandy, I don't just want to be your backup
I want to be the real deal.
Mon and I have broken up...
Just so you're clear!
I only promised to be your backup, not the real deal.
Mandy, I know you like me.
Why can't we be together?
It's timing, timing is important.
I can only have you as my backup.
We can't change that.
You do like me, if not...
Let go!
I sneaked out to tell you...
I have promised Wai to marry him tonight.
Why have you call me out in a rush?
We're having desserts.
Why did you bring me here?
Come on.
Let me go.
Stop!
To revenge, you need to face your enemy.
No...
Just be smart.
Bobo.
Bobo?
It's so nice of you to bring Bobo here.
I've read the desserts here are good.
So I brought Bobo here to try.
Who knew this is your shop.
Order what ever you want.
Okay.
Baby, what do you want?
I'll eat anything you order, baby.
Okay.
Baby loves mango pudding and...
I want green beans soup.
I forgot baby has a cough.
Cough.
You can't have this then.
Coconut milk with tree mushroom then.
Is it okay?
Okay.
Boss, we're in trouble.
The sesames are all burnt!
You are so careless.
I'm just a trainee, and Ming isn't here.
Call him to come back.
His son is getting marry in the Mainland.
What should we do?
Let me help you.
What do you know?
The sesame was always cooked by Boss...
No...
I mean Miss Kwong.
Let me help you.
How long have you been with him?
What's it to do with you?
Just curious.
Does he treat you well?
Better than you.
Have you ever thought of expanding the business?
Of course.
But you need quite a lot of capital.
Which the banks have a lot.
With the good business and fame.
Banks will be dying to lend you money.
I think if you expand the business as a franchise.
Selling your own brand, it can be great.
Looks like you've done some research.
I am interested in anything that can earn money.
We're quite alike.
What's with all the changes?
Doing meals and desserts.
Kiki said this is diversification.
To earn more money.
You need money?
No, she wants to save money to get marry...
If you are interested, give me a call.
Okay.
Bobo, thank you.
The sesame can last for a few days.
Ask Ming to come back as fast as possible.
I will.
Bobo, you are so kind.
Helping whole-heartedly even though the shop is not yours.
You haven't changed the name.
The shop is still called "Bobo's Dessert".
I thought you'd change it to "Kiki's Dessert".
She was afraid that the regulars wouldn't come.
Sorry.
Baby, let's go.
Let me carry it.
Thanks baby.
We haven't kissed today.
Let's go and watch a movie.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Have you finished holding my arm?
Chun said he will marry Kiki soon.
Really?
I used to ask him when he'd marry me.
He said after the business is running smoothly.
Now the business is great, but I am no longer the boss.
When will you start revenging for me?
Very soon.
I can't wait any longer.
I'm afraid the next time I see Kiki, I'll explode.
Buy a knife and stabs her to death.
Calm down, you'll go to prison.
I've finally got you!
You're not so smart, are you!
?
Hello.
Closing so early?
Needs to visit my wife at the hospital.
She's still in hospital?
Yes, she has to stay for few more days.
Women illnesses, cause so much trouble.
Send my regards to your wife.
Okay.
Your girlfriend is such a nice girl.
You should treasure her or it's your lost.
Hear that, boyfriend.
Yes, girlfriend.
Let's kiss.
Let's go
Mon, someone's here for you.
You are...
I am May.
I don't know you.
I am Alex's girlfriend.
That day... you gave me this.
What do you want?
I want to thank you.
Thank me?
I have broken up with Alex.
Thanks for letting me know.
Did he hit you?
I know about his past.
I have asked his ex-girlfriends.
Did they... tell you...
He would apologize... when it starts... and says... he had too much to drink.
Couldn't control himself.
But when you forgive him, he would do it again.
Again and again, up to your limit.
Then he would call you 100 times a day.
If he can't find you, he would...
He would call your friends, your colleagues,
Shouts at them, and everyone will be afraid of you.
Did they tell you the same things?
I am fine.
Don't let him find you.
Half a year.
He will give up after half a year.
I'm going back to Toronto.
He'll never find me.
I come to thank you.
You are brave.
How did you know about Alex and I?
I saw your photos at his home.
You are much more happy now.
I know you have let go.
Really.
Thank you so much.
I think we can be friends.
Sorry, I am late.
It's my fault, giving you such a short notice.
It's okay.
What is it you want to talk about?
Last time you talked about expanding the business.
I've thought about it, I agree with you.
Of course.
The food industry is very vibrant and... the future looks good.
So I did some homework and want to discuss with you.
Would you mind?
You are prepared.
Like you,
I am interested in anything that can make money.
Through out this year,
I have learned how to run a dessert shop.
From stocking, manpower to packaging...
I have all the contacts.
I believe you have... got a plan already.
But something's missing.
What?
I knew you are a smart guys, when I first met you.
But I couldn't understand...
Why would you be with someone like Bobo?
She is my girlfriend.
You didn't need to speak that way.
I'm a straight forward person.
You don't seem to disagree.
So you must feel the same way.
Let me look at your work.
Hey, good news.
She is in the trap.
Come out.
Long time no see.
Really?
I always find you looking at me outside my shop.
Never.
I'm only on my way to eat here.
It doesn't matter anymore.
You wouldn't see me even if you come by tomorrow.
Why?
This is the last day of the shop.
The proprietor called back the shop.
What's your plan?
I plan to stay with my sister in Singapore.
She is pregnant again, the baby's due next month.
Will you come back?
I don't know.
It's good to make changes.
Maybe I will return to school.
I haven't decided yet.
Don't you miss anything here?
Is there anything I should miss?
I don't know, just curious.
Have you seen my sister's elder daughter?
So cute.
Right.
She is now 2 years old.
She called me "Auntie" last time.
Right, how is your sister?
She is fine.
She asked about you.
Me?
She told you to come and visit.
But I told her we haven't seen each other for a long time.
It has been a long time, I doesn't hold any grudges anymore.
My sister doesn't blame you.
How are you recently?
Are you still scamming people?
What question is that?
Of course not.
Stop scamming.
Grow up, be a mensch.
I know what to do.
This is my Singapore address, come visit us.
Okay, agreed.
I have to go.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
Yan...
What is it?
Take care.
You too.
I will be waiting for you.
Missy, you come at a good time.
Where is my friend?
He is really drunk.
How come?
After he spoke with the laundry girl, he made himself drunk.
We're here...
Sit down.
You are so drunk.
Why are you so nice to me?
Stop moving, you are drunk.
I'm scamming you.
Why are you so nice to me?
You're not scamming me.
I believe you won't scam me.
I'm not scamming you?
What am I?
A conman!
Why shouldn't I scam you?
You wouldn't have told me so much if you're scamming me.
She told me she want to see me.
How can I face her?
I scammed her.
I owed the loan shark.
I scammed all my girlfriend's sister's money.
It was me!
I scammed her...
I made her sister committed suicide.
She doesn't blame me, and asked me to visit?
Does she have a problem!
I would rather she hate me for life!
Who does she think she is?
Holy Mary, pitying me.
Don't talk like this.
Just cry, you'll feel better.
You feel guilty, it's a step forward.
You can change now you know you've done wrong.
I believe you, you can change.
Really?
I believe you.
Don't be upset.
You're not that bad.
Can do better though.
I'll cook for you when I have time.
Why the long face?
Not going to ask me in?
What now?
I told you I would come back.
I said I am not into it.
But the bros agree, it won't work without you.
How flattering.
Keung, help me this once.
Just make a call.
No matter what, you will get 500 thousands.
This is quite a good business.
You don't have to worry.
Will you hurt the girl?
Not even a string of hair.
We just want money.
So?
I won't rat on you even if I get caught.
I'll face the consequences.
Stop thinking!
I'll count you in.
Bye.
Right.
A familiar looking girl came downstairs... when I was waiting for you.
Where did I meet her?
You say you know every girl you meet.
Forget it.
Now you mention it, I want some action.
You cooked for the conman again?
Are you serious with him?
What are you talking about?
You paid him and... now you are serving him.
Why don't you just present yourself on a plate.
Hello?
You're not in love with him, are you?
What?
We are just friends.
That's better be the truth.
Luckily, we have different tastes.
I'll never choose a man you like.
That's great then.
At least we won't fall in love with the same guy.
You still haven't found your boyfriend?
Seems like he has vanished.
He will appear again sooner or later.
Great.
Now you're trying to teach me.
I talk to you and I get shot at.
I got it.
Talk later.
Bye.
Where have you been?
Can you grant me one wish before you get married?
In the backup lover contract, it states we should celebrate our birthdays with our partner first.
Backup lover can only celebrate before or after.
I would like to celebrate a week early.
This means today is my birthday.
I have already bought the tickets.
I've been waiting... to go on a trip with you.
You're such an idiot.
Didn't you say you want to see snow?
Why do you treat me so well?
'Cos I don't know how to treat you badly.
Next day, Mandy and I went to Japan.
Those were... the happiest fortnights of my life.
But time flies by, especially happy days.
You go first.
Can I still see you?
Of course.
Even after you become Mrs Li?
Thank you.
We are going to break up here?
Didn't we agree that on the plane?
Can I take back my words?
Don't act like a child.
But I really like you.
Like... and being together...
Has become two very different things.
We can only be each others backup.
Not starters.
Just like a football game.
Substitutes warms up and watches the game... on the sideline.
Time flies by.
But in the starting lineup...
The pressures are big.
And because we are backup...
We let things go easily.
If we are dating, every flaws will be seen.
We wouldn't be able to take it.
I'm getting married.
Let's remember our precious moment.
And forget about... the bad ones.
I like you.
I will always like you.
Quite good.
I will remember all the things you taught me.
Sorry, I was with someone else behind your back.
It's in the past.
Aren't you angry with me?
Since you left, I've learned a lot.
If there's a will to forget things, there's always a way.
Did something happen to you?
A lot.
Most importantly,
I know what kind of person I am.
Fung...
I miss you.
Me too.
I know I was horrible to you.
But I didn't mean to.
I don't know how to love.
Or it was because...
nobody had loved me before.
My temper was flaring at you everyday...
I only wanted you to know me better.
I have a lot to tell you...
But whenever I see you...
I don't know how to start.
Tell me.
I am willing to listen.
I don't mean to check your phone.
But it is one of... my hobbies.
I wish all the women you know...
Are fat, ugly and old.
When I am having my period,
I can show my temper.
It's only a few days every month.
When I'm throwing a temper, and tells you to stay away,
It's always a lie.
You must come looking for me.
Don't take it seriously... when I'm throwing a temper.
When I say it's wrong, it's right.
Whey I say no, I mean yes.
Do you understand what I am talking about?
When I run away in a street,
You must chase after me.
I don't want to search for your face...
By the reflection of a glass or mirror.
I say I want to go on diet.
But I actually want to hear you say,
"You are not fat.
I like you the way you are."
I am such an insecure person.
Because I love you too much.
I can't live without you.
Fung, don't leave me.
Has anyone told you a relationship needs timing.
We got together at the wrong time, it won't work.
You deserve someone better.
In fact, I am happy to... see you like this.
You've changed.
I am sure you can find someone you love...
Who loves you the same back.
Fung...
But I am not so lucky.
I am not the one.
Fung, no.
You should give freedom to the one you love.
Not trying to control.
A friend has just taught me that.
We should give each other more freedom.
Because we love each other.
Don't cry, silly.
We won't split up.
Because good friends never split up.
Sorry.
Not at all.
I just arrived.
Finished?
It took me all night.
I tell you, this is the perfect proposal.
This good?
Let me explain to you.
We share the 3 million in the first year.
We can borrow 1/3 from the bank.
It means you only pay 1 million up front.
I thought about it, we should open 3 shops first.
On HK island, aim at middle class.
Seeing the increasing percentage,
I think we can open up to 10 shops in 3 years.
This is awesome.
You think the numbers are accurate too?
I mean the color printing is awesome.
As a prop, it is like the real thing.
What prop?
The proposal is up to proper standards.
Thank you, Mark.
I am Henry.
I got it wrong.
Henry does finance.
Mark runs restaurant.
What, was it something I said?
Who told you?
Do you remember Tiffany?
Kiki, are you free to meet up?
You have some guts.
Scammed my little cousin and now me?
Then it's time for me to leave.
Wouldn't that be easy for you?
What do you want?
You've lost nothing, you want to call the cops?
That's not what I meant.
I want to do business.
Business?
Okay, let's talk.
I'm afraid you will tell my boyfriend too.
Then you will destroy my whole plan.
We value secrets, I can keep my mouth shut.
How much?
200 thousands.
Why?
Because of the shop you want to open.
Just think of it as decoration costs.
Or buy a lock to lock your mouth.
I like this metaphor.
How much did Bobo pay you to get close to me?
This is another business.
If I ask you to double cross her...
How much?
This early?
Yeah, I've cooked you some soup.
It's only been a few days, so messy already?
No, it's just the same.
It's okay.
I will clean it up.
Eat the soup first.
I got to go to the toilet.
Okay.
Hey, a visitor.
Go and open it.
Morning, Bobo.
Why didn't you make a call first?
I want to surprise you.
Looks like you're not the surprised one.
Did you tell her?
I've had enough.
Bobo, it's through.
I know your plan.
What are you talking about?
You wanted to scam me?
Not so easily.
You tell me...
Why is this happening?
We've been having fun for a long time.
That's enough.
I know...
You are lying.
You are acting.
You're always like this, don't know when you are faking it.
Tell me, you are lying.
You said you would help me.
You said you wouldn't scam me.
Nobody trusts you, except me.
You are so stupid.
He is a conman...
If he doesn't scam you, how does he live.
Shut up!
Bitch!
What have I ever done to you.
Why do you keep stealing my things.
I don't think of it as stealing, just fighting.
Good things need to be fight for.
I don't think I am wrong.
But I am your friend.
Then you should be more understanding.
But, I've never treated you as my best friend.
So I don't have to consider your feelings.
Bitch!
- Come here!
- Are you mad...
- I'm going to kill you!
- Let go!
Are you crazy!
Have you finished!
Go!
Go!
I don't want to see you!
Go!
I hate you.
I hate you!
I hate you!
Are you satisfied?
20 thousands for this.
It's some easy money.
Just give me the money.
It was really fun.
I felt so great... to see her in tears.
How about, I double the price.
For you to trick her again.
You finished?
Please leave.
What is it?
I'm not doing business with you...
Why are you so angry?
Are you crazy?
Why don't you give your money to charities, bitch.
A conman teaches me to become a good person?
Is it hurting you?
Or did you want me to make the poor girl leave?
So you are in love with her.
At least she knows how to cry.
How about you?
You are cold blooded.
Forget it.
How can you teach me?
We are two of a kind.
I'll let you look into your conscience.
But I got to thank you.
I have given your proposal... to the bank.
They said it is very detailed and... will lend me the money.
I'm going to sign the contract now.
Let me be honest for a moment,
It's such a waste... for you to be a conman.
If we can work together, it would be great.
Bye-bye.
Hello?
Chun!
Chun... are you okay?
Are you okay?
What happened?
No...
I've got nothing...
Where is Kiki?
She took my staffs.
My money and stocks.
Her shop is opening across the street next week.
What should we do?
Bobo, sorry.
I shouldn't have left you.
I deserve this!
I deserve this...
Don't talk about this now.
We shouldn't talk about this right now.
We should focus on the business, right?
Business?
She even took the pots and pans.
What business?
We can't be defeated this easily.
Relax, I got a plan.
I have brought all the utensils here.
- What for?
- Put it in the kitchen.
Dad.
Have you called the fruit suppliers' buddies?
They're here.
Sweet heart, why did you order so much fruit?
Making dessert for the shop.
Quick, inside...
- Coming...
- What has this shop got to do with you?
Why not?
Didn't you see, the sign still reads,
"Bobo's Dessert"?
Boss!
Boss!
We were wrong.
Please forgive us.
Please employ us again.
Let us come back to work.
Look, we've got my uniform back on.
I thought you two are working at Kiki's?
Don't mention that bitch!
She just vanished before the shop opened.
We couldn't find her.
We heard she owes some loan shark money.
How come?
Since we don't have enough staffs... we'll let you come back.
But remember, work hard.
- Yes!
Thanks!
- I got it...
Haven't work for ages.
What's happened to Kiki?
Why, you worry about her?
No.
But she's so smart, how did this happen?
Anyway, a package for you.
For me?
Yes.
I'll go inside and keep my eye on them.
Master!
How's the Taiwanese girl?
Are you Miss Fung?
Yes.
I'm Mr. Wong.
Manager Cheung is sick today.
I'm here to represent him to discuss the loan.
What a coincidence?
Yes, he went to the Mainland.
When he got back, he started suffering from fever.
Let's discuss upstairs.
Fine.
But... now...
Since we think Manager Cheung has contracted the bird flu, we are sterilizing the office.
If you don't mind, we can go upstairs.
Then... maybe we can discuss in a cafe.
Miss Fung.
I have read your proposal, it is very detailed.
We are happy to lend you the money.
Thank you so much.
In fact, the prospect is good for your business.
I go to your shop quite often myself.
Excuse me, I got to take medicine.
Chinese medicine?
So cute?
Yes, this is my family recipe.
For relieving internal heat.
Family recipe?
Have you ever heard of "Wong Lui Kit"?
He is my great grandfather.
Is it not the famous Chinese medicine store?
Yes.
He is my great grandfather.
I am Wong Sik Guak.
We are named according to our family book.
Tradition thing.
I've never thought... you are so well off.
Well off.
What's well off?
Very rich.
We've only got about 20 shops.
But we plan to expand to the Mainland next year.
How many shops are you planning to open?
99 shops in the first year.
To around 500 shops in 5 years time.
Comparing my business to yours...
I'm like Jack compare to the bean stalk.
Forgive my intrusion...
But your plan is very good.
You don't have to borrow from the bank.
A lot of people are willing to lend you the capital.
- Really?
- Yes.
Like us.
We are interested in doing dessert.
You can discuss with us.
But you are running... such a big business.
There's no big and small to business.
We can discuss about the details later.
What's important is, if you are interested?
Of course.
That's great.
But...
About Manager Cheung, if...
Relax, I won't answer his calls.
I can't believe...
This is the first time we've met, we are so alike.
Because we are both interested in making money.
True.
Since then,
I've arranged a few meetings with her.
Got some extras to play the parts.
That's what I called acting.
I told her... you need to show your sincerity doing business.
Since we're paying out few billions.
A few millions from her would be reasonable.
I never thought she would dare to borrow from loan sharks.
Look at the loan shark, scary eh?
You didn't have to scam her for so long, did you?
Master, I didn't expect the girl... would asked me to be her boyfriend.
So I took her on some trips.
Take a look at these.
You're a conman not a gigolo.
She's hot.
Poor you.
Master, your share.
I don't want it.
It's not like you.
Have you dealt with that 100 thousands?
Into the account as you have asked.
You really don't want it?
It's yours.
You got money now.
Leave this business.
Get a real job.
But I am on fire.
I have tried to persuade you.
I'll retire.
Take care.
What are you going to do?
- Be myself.
- Can you?
Years ago, someone asked me to do this.
But I couldn't.
Recently I met someone else, she said I can.
So I want to give it a shot.
Master, are you in love?
You sound Jane Austen...
But looking at you, you look heart broken.
Maybe there wasn't any romance.
I can't provide what she needs.
Right, the mountain areas in the Mainland lack resources.
I have done some research.
A toilet need 300 bucks, 3000 for a pig, 5000 for a cow.
And a year tuition fee for a primary school child, it's 500.
I plan to send some resources... through the charities in HK.
You've earned so much, it will be nice...
If you contribute.
Master!
You've... thought of a peach of an idea.
Scamming children and pigs.
Awesome.
Count me in.
I will count my friends in too.
You bastard.
Count me in!
Never mind.
Auntie.
- Here.
- Thanks... have a slice of beef.
Thank you, auntie.
Excellent, the shop is open.
Boss!
It's you again.
I've just got off the plane.
You look so happy, are you pregnant?
What?
What would you like?
Hotpot.
Move...
I'll get you a bowl.
I'll make myself at home.
I can have dessert later.
Where did you come back from?
Silk Road.
Have you got any souvenirs?
Yes...
I was just kidding...
More food.
Camel's leg.
What's your name?
Call me Cousin.
Cheers!
Yo!
Pretty.
Want to be my girlfriend?
Say something.
Damn it!
It's boring!
- What's funny...
- Gutted.
Still laughing!
Find something to do.
Do what... woman?
Great... where's the woman?
How about the school girl from the other afternoon.
- You only talk!
- You don't believe me?
I'll show you.
And since that day,
I felt very uncomfortable.
So I followed Bobo every day...
On her way to and from school.
I'm scared that Lui will be true to his words.
Chun.
What is it?
Someone is stalking me.
Forget it, let's go.
A week later.
Lui and I was sentenced to juvenile centre... for robbery.
And I haven't seen Bobo since.
Hey.
How's business?
Where's your girlfriend.
Can I have a slice?
Sorry, sold out.
This one is for a regular customer.
He called to order.
It's okay.
Did you have a fight with your girlfriend?
Girls nowadays love to hide their feelings.
And only feel the love, if the guys keep guessing.
It's cold tonight, go home and make up.
Say "Sorry, I love you".
It's just a few words.
Sometimes, you don't get a second chance.
I'll come again.
Remember to bring your girlfriend.
Of course.
Hey
Hey, working so late?
I just saw your boyfriend.
My boyfriend?
Yes, are you two playing hide and seek?
Honey.
Honey.
Are you feeling better?
Much better.
She is so nice, always asking how you are.
You are fighting with your boyfriend?
Arguing with your boyfriend?
Men never think with their heads.
They don't know they are making others angry.
It's just women are more forgiving.
At least you know that.
He used to be a gambling addict.
I was going to marry someone else instead.
But he came crying and begged me to stay.
So I asked if he is willing to change.
He said yes and I believed him.
That was a few decades ago.
You just like my good looks.
But he really hasn't gamble since.
If he really likes you, he will change.
If you don't ask the question, you'll regret it.
Go and look for your boyfriend.
He couldn't have gone too far.
Okay, I will come back.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.
Don't move!
Police.
We suspect you are related to a kidnapping case.
- Let go!
- Come with us!
Move!
- What for, Sir?
- Get into the car.
Go...
It won't just be a broken arm next time, okay!
Blame it on your bro who betrayed you.
My boss warns you not to touch his women again.
Bobo.
Where did you go?
I thought I saw an old friend.
So I came out to take a look.
Did you find him?
It was some one else.
Look.
Where did you get it?
I'm a regular customer.
Come on.
They are waiting us.
I can't provide what she needs.
Hello?
It's me.
Where have you been?
Why haven't you called me?
We are talking now...
Bobo.
I... am dating.
Really?
Congratulations!
Thank you!
How about you?
I will open a new shop next month.
And I'm getting married soon.
Really?
Congratulations.
Why don't we meet up?
Yeah, I've heard that before.
I mean it, we've never met in person.
True.
Do you remember how we met?
Trade this...
Miss, stealing your boyfriend's mobile again?
This one is newer.
Just shut up and check.
Hey, it's ringing.
How can you trade in without taking out... the SIM card?
No ID.
I'm not answering.
You stole it.
Okay, okay.
Bonjour?
Do you do plumbing here?
You've got the wrong number.
Do you know where can I find a plumber?
My shop's sewage pipe is broken.
If it wasn't for your sewage pipe
I wouldn't have known you.
Yuck.
What?
That's what happened.
After that call, you met Fung?
That's all in the past, let's forget it.
Didn't you say your boyfriend is coming?
He is.
There's a traffic jam.
But my baby is really awesome.
How awesome?
Where did you meet him?
He was a customer at the bar.
He came one night when he was heart broken.
His eyes are so thoughtful.
You know I love this type.
We've talked for so long,
I should know you quite well.
Let me guess what he looks like.
Okay.
He... is tall.
Short hair, wears glasses.
He is polite.
Smile all the time.
Morning.
He is... gentle, neat and tidy.
I told you I know you well.
Right.
Someone's here.
This must be my baby.
What does he do?
Same as your boyfriend.
He owns a dessert shop.
- Baby.
- Honey.
I'll never choose a man you like.
At least we won't fall for the same guy.
Hello?
Bobo, where are you?
I'm near Neway.
You haven't gone upstairs yet?
Then just go home and sleep it off.
No, I really want to go.
Don't make a fool out of yourself.
I really miss him.
How about you wait for me,
I'll go upstairs with you!
No, it's okay.
You don't sound okay.
I'm fine.
I'll call you later.
Gotta go.
Bye.
Bobo...
Hello?
Bobo, how was it?
Nevermind!
Bobo!
Mon, it's busy out there, come on!
Okay!
That table wants a bucket of Bud.
Okay.
Here's the beer!
Are you sure there's enough to drink?
How about another bucket?
Okay?
Two buckets...
Okay, souvenirs for you.
Thank you... be right back.
Beware of your boyfriend!
Congratulations...
Come on, I want to thank you for helping me.
I'm in a hurry.
I have a date tonight.
Come in for a manicure...
You asked me to buy you something to eat.
And you are cheating on me?
How nice of you.
No...
I'm not cheating!
I've been waiting for you!
Have fun!
Mon!
Don't be angry.
We're finished!
What?
I said I didn't cheat on you!
I was waiting for you.
Forget it!
We're finished!
Mon, you say we're finished all the time.
I am serious this time!
Mon!
Stop following me!
Mandy, Mandy!
Let go!
You're hurting me!
Have you finished screaming?
No!
Have you finished with the other girl?
What are you talking about?
That mainland chick.
The one who... called you "baby" just now!
You listened to my calls?
You've checked my messages too.
It's very fair, Mr Li.
What do you want?
I don't want to see you again!
Get lost!
I pay the rent for the shop,
I'm not going anywhere!
You can have it.
What?
Love watching a scene?
Move!
Sorry.
Hey!
Closed for the day.
Thank you, boss.
Thank you.
Get back to work.
I flown back specially for this,
Why is the shop closed?
So annoying!
Boss.
Boss, you don't recognize me?
I am Cousin.
I used to come all the time.
Boss, why is the shop close?
What's the good news?
Boss, are you pregnant?
No.
Where's your boyfriend?
Boss, can you open up for me?
I'm leaving tomorrow.
I am not the boss!
The shop is not mine!
Not anymore!
Bobo.
It's Kiki.
I sat behind you since prep school.
Where have you been?
Long time no see.
Long time no see.
You can speak Cantonese, I'm okay with it.
How do you know I'm here?
I saw you in a magazine, so I came to pay you a visit.
He's my boyfriend, Michael.
- Hi.
- Hi!
Sorry.
We got a table.
Sit here.
Bobo, you have quite a business.
It's only small.
Kiki, you've gone missing since grade 7.
Where have you been?
Taiwan.
Taiwan?
Have you forgotten my mom is Taiwanese?
A rumour in school said your family had gone bankrupt.
Bankrupt?
Quite the opposite.
My dad became rich.
From the lottery, 30 millions.
Then there were no reason to leave.
My dad did business with the money.
But after the financial crisis, we lost everything.
Good luck is just the beginning of a nightmare.
So I only trust myself.
That's so pessimistic,
You can trust me.
Men, is the last thing I'll trust.
Here comes my boyfriend.
Chun.
He wants to be an actor.
Awesome.
This is Michael's first visit to Hong Kong.
First visit?
Try some more, our dessert is very famous.
What is this?
Mango mix.
Delicious?
What did I say?
Your boyfriend is so cute.
Bobo!
- Bobo!
- Kiki?
Michael dumped me.
Why are you so drunk?
Sit down first...
Bobo, what's all the noise?
Kiki's been dumped and she's drunk.
I'm so good to him!
- It's OK...
What should we do now?
Take her home.
Me?
- No. 32, Lobster Bay!
- I got it.
I am not the boss!
Hey!
Why are you calling me?
I lost my mobile.
What has it got to do with me?
I wonder if you have seen it.
Of course not.
But I left it in the shop.
It was there before you came last night.
Are you saying I took it?
No, that's not what I meant.
I'm just asking if you have seen it.
Listen, we've split up already.
Don't find excuses to call me.
Go to hell!
Mon!
Mon...
He really didn't dare to cheat!
Why is weirdo Queeny treating us for lunch?
She is so stingy.
I've heard, she wants us to meet her fiance.
What?
Fi... what?
Husband to be!
She is going to get married next month.
Someone wants her?
Bobo, why are you so quiet?
I am fine.
Let's move then.
I am hungry.
Why are you three so late?
I've been waiting for you and I have ordered dim sum.
Sorry.
Let me... introduce my fiance.
He is my fiance
- Henry.
- Hello.
- Hi.
Hi, have I met you before?
Impossible!
Henry was born in England.
Just came back for work.
What does he do?
I am a Financial Controller.
He's got a great... job!
Queeny has made a good catch.
I have only been back 3 months.
Shouldn't have met you.
Maybe I have got it wrong.
Of course you have.
Henry barely knows Chinese.
All his Cantonese has been taught by me.
No offense, how would he know girls of your class?
She called that no offense?
She might as well have sworn.
You must be thinking... how Henry and I met.
Let's order first.
Right.
Let's order.
- Great.
- My Chinese is not good.
Let me order.
Baby, don't order spicy food.
I got it, Sweetie.
What do you want to eat?
I want to eat you, Sweetie.
I want to puke.
Hey.
Hey, how much is it?
It's new.
Nine hundred.
I'll pay more for this one.
Why so late, come on.
Big news.
What is it?
Queeny committed suicide last night.
What!
Did she die?
Luckily, still alive.
The boss just called, she visited Queeny.
She can't come to work for a few days.
Did she say why Queeny committed suicide?
Rumor has it that her fiance had scammed her money.
And he just disappeared.
I knew something was fishy about that guy.
Have I met you before?
Sweetie.
You want to call that fat bitch?
If you tell on me, I'll hunt you down.
I... won't...
Don't tell that fat bitch you've seen me, okay?
Hey!
What?
Are you good at scamming people?
I received Kiki's email.
And there's a link to her blog.
Who is it?
So mysterious.
There's a video too.
No wonder she didn't need me for her birthday.
Is it ready?
Count to three then open your eyes!
Did you make a wish?
Let's show yourself.
Happy birthday, Honey!
Thank you, baby.
Baby, kiss me.
- Are you happy?
- Yeah, very happy!
No. 32, Lobster Bay!
Sit tight.
Michael, I really love you.
Don't leave me.
I'm not Michael, I am Chun.
Sit tight, okay?
Hey!
Fasten your seat belt...
I really love you.
Chun...
I love you.
Hello?
Kiki?
Bobo.
You scared me to death, are you okay?
I'm fine.
Luckily, Chun took me back...
I was so worry about you two.
- Where is Chun?
- Chun...
Where is he?
Bobo, sorry.
Why are you apologizing?
I puked all over the floor.
He's cleaning up after me.
He deserves this.
Kiki, never drink so much again
I'll worry about you.
I got it.
He's back, I'll let you talk to him.
Thanks, Kiki.
Hello?
How was it?
Cleaning up after my friend's mess.
It's OK.
Bobo, I will be back soon.
Talk later.
Bye.
What?
Don't.
What took you so long?
I am busy.
Have dinner tonight.
I told you I'm going to Bobo's.
Why?
It's her mom's birthday.
When will you tell her?
You said you don't love her anymore.
Say something.
How about I tell her...
I'll see you tonight.
Okay, I will wait for you.
Got to go.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
Kiki let me found out they are together on purpose.
She is so sly!
She thought of this way to push me out!
Have you finished your story?
You met me today.
And I have listened to your rant.
I'll call that even.
See you.
I'll pay you.
To scam Kiki for me
I want to revenge!
How much?
Name your price.
200 thousands.
200 thousands?
I don't have that much.
How about 150 thousands?
I don't have that.
Then how are you going to revenge?
Maybe you can buy a knife to kill her, that's cheap.
100 thousands.
I can pay you 100 thousands at most.
Let's finish the drinks.
How will you pay?
Give me some time.
I can get the money.
2 days.
2 days?
!
Nevermind.
Okay!
I will have it!
Give me your number.
I will call you.
Are you nuts!
What if you call the cops?
I won't.
I give you two days, 7 p.m. Wah Fu playground.
What if you don't show up?
Who's begging here?
Just concentrate on getting the money.
Cheer up,
I've bought you a new mobile.
Thank you.
I'm not upset anymore, let's eat!
Come on, I'm hungry.
Drop off the things and dine with me.
Don't!
Just go home.
I really want to go.
Don't make a fool out of yourself.
I really miss him.
Bobo.
I didn't think you would come.
How's my Cantonese?
Chun taught me.
Did he?
Chun said you wouldn't come.
I said you're a forgiving person.
It's been a long time.
How have you been these days, still good?
I just came to say happy birthday to Chun.
Don't leave yet,
We've waited for you to cut the cake.
Where is Chun?
Baby, look who has come?
Bobo, long time no see.
Long time no see.
I'll let you catch up.
Baby, I'll check if the cake is ready.
Happy birthday.
Thank you.
How are you lately?
Okay.
I called you but no one answered.
Did you need me for something?
Nothing... just wanted to know how you are.
You still have time for me?
Thanks.
Why don't you open it?
Yes.
Baby, my best friend is here, come and say hi.
Okay.
Bobo...
Sorry, Bobo, don't go yet.
Have some cake before you go.
Crystal, my boyfriend.
- Hello, happy birthday.
- Hi.
Do you know who she is?
No.
She's Kiki's boyfriend's ex-girlfriend.
Did she came for a fight?
What with?
Madame, hello
I am the customer service officer Swipe.
How may I help you?
Please come with me.
Can I borrow money from here?
Honestly... we sell wanton noodles here.
Are you nuts?
Can't you read our sign?
Just leave!
No...
I come to borrow money.
How much do you want?
100 thousands.
100 thousands?
Did you bring tax, salary, rent, water rate, electric, gas...
IDD, internet, mobile phone statements... job references, residential proof,
ID card...
Copies, etc?
Yes, I have them all here.
Good girl!
You are quite sincere.
Yes, I really need the money.
What is it for?
I need to say?
Of course.
If you use the money to kill someone... or become... a drug dealer...
We are accomplices, what if we are caught?
What should we say?
I'm guilty!
Idiot!
Do I have to?
Nah, I can take a guess.
You wouldn't get it right.
It's just a game.
Your dad needs money to pay off loan sharks?
Your brother defalcated money?
Your sister is a shopaholic, needs to pay back debts?
It isn't one of our top three reasons?
Impossible, what is it...
Don't tell me, let me guess...
I want to revenge!
I need the money to revenge!
You make me laugh!
Tell me.
A few days ago, I met a conman.
He said if I give him 100 thousands...
He will scam the woman who stole my boyfriend.
I see.
It's all worth it right?
Did you call the police?
The police can revenge for me?
Tell the police to catch the conman.
Why do all of you think I have a problem?
You are fine.
You are cute, you are stupid...
A cute idiot!
"Police Chat" has shown so many times already...
You're still being scam, idiot!
What if he's not scamming me?
What if he really can scam that woman for me?
Well, he is a conman.
An old thousand, you know?
But he's being pay by me to scam someone else.
We won't lend you money.
I am sorry.
I beg you.
I am really sorry.
Have you ever had your heart broken?
Have you ever found your best friend... stealing your boyfriend?
She had it planned!
She planned to steal my shop... the first day she turned up.
She is right.
I can trust no one.
I can only rely on myself.
I trusted Kiki too much.
I trusted my boyfriend too much.
I put him on the taxi with my own hand.
I handed her over to Kiki.
I've had this birthday card with me... since the day he dumped me.
It is the first birthday card...
Chun gave me.
After we split up...
I look at it everyday.
He told me, I am his "My Favorites".
But it turns out, his honest words... is just a big lie.
I am not his "My Favorites".
I'm like the "My Favorites"
On computers, one out of many.
Deleted when out of favor.
Even if I'm being scammed, I will not regret it.
It's a gamble I'm willing to take.
Pay back on time.
Thank you.
But rules are rules.
I'll have your dad defalcated money as reason.
It'll be easier for me.
Hey,
Where's the money?
100 thousands.
Awesome.
You really got it.
When will you start to scam Kiki?
You can't rush these things.
I need to plan.
When will that be?
Give me your phone number.
I have a big deal this week.
I will call you after that.
What if you don't call me?
What if you run away...
Will you shut up!
If you don't trust me, you can find someone else.
No...
Call me, I'll wait.
That's right.
Relax.
Just wait for my call.
Where have you been for the past few days?
Come and save me!
Wai locks the doors and windows.
I couldn't find the key.
What?
What are you two up to?
I said I won't let him go to do business in the mainland... and fighting.
Hey, I can see you!
Me?
Look up.
Can you see me?
How is it?
It's double locked.
What now?
I'll knock down the door.
Stand back.
Look at you.
Eating like a child.
Slow down.
I am really hungry.
Hello?
No, not my turn yet.
Will you come back tonight?
You'll be back.
I'll cook for you.
Okay, bye.
Hello?
I'm buying lunch.
Not my turn yet.
You're off early tonight?
Great.
What do you want to eat?
I'll cook for you.
See you tonight, bye.
What do you want?
Rice with pig knuckles.
There's only one box left.
It's okay.
I'll have rice with spam and egg instead.
Rice with spam and egg for one.
Hey.
Let's share.
It's okay, you eat some.
I can't finish this much.
But you have nothing left.
It's good to share.
Have we met before?
You are 58.
What 58?
I am 30. 3 stores behind yours.
No wonder you look so familiar.
Why have you never said hello to me?
We've only just met.
Eat some more.
I've got enough.
You like pig knuckles.
You don't like it?
I don't actually like pig knuckles.
And you queue up?
You're weird.
I was just following the crowd.
It must be good if you need to queue up.
Here.
You have a piece of spam then.
And half an egg...
Hey?
Where are you going?
I'm coming to pick you up from work.
Don't.
What is it now?
It's Elaine's birthday.
We plan to go to karaoke.
I'll come with you.
As if!
It's ladies night, guys are not welcome.
Then what will I do?
I'll give you a night off.
- But don't put a foot wrong.
- I won't dare...
Elaine's calling.
See you, bye.
Okay.
Bye.
Hey, went to the suppliers?
Yeah, new arrivals.
How can you carry so much?
I've got you.
Do you think the new clothes are pretty?
Yeah.
Come on, there's still a lot.
Can you give me a hand.
Hold my waist, you want me to fall down?
Be careful.
You look silly.
Someone's here.
Hey?
What is it?
Late night snack?
Okay, where?
Okay, I'll come now.
He's gone.
How does he treat you?
Why do you ask?
Is there nothing else to talk about?
Just curious.
Well... how does she treat you?
Now you ask me.
He is a stock agent. 10 years older than me.
He gave me the money to open this shop.
He said with a shop,
I wouldn't go out and meet guys.
I really do like him.
I've turned down men... who are better than him.
How does your sister treat you?
She is only older than me by a few months.
She treats me very well...
Only she has bad temper.
As long as you can stand her.
Hey... do you think I'm useless?
I'm actually jealous... she has got such a good boyfriend.
Really?
How about... you become my boyfriend too?
What?
No?
How about your own boyfriend?
He's too busy to have time for me.
So you want me... to be your backup?
Why not?
I'll be your backup lover too.
If your girlfriend is busy, I will be with you.
I don't mind.
Do you?
Since we are backups, we can only see each other when our own partner is busy.
So the initiative is on our partners.
What about birthdays and festivals?
It's fine.
We can celebrate earlier.
For example, we can celebrate Christmas Eve a week early.
Sounds like so much fun.
Are you learning Mandarin?
Yes.
Wai, my boyfriend.
Said he will take me to...
Shanghai on my birthday.
I have been learning for a long time.
Then how is it?
I "live" you.
It should be I "like" you.
Let's say:
I love you.
How can you say "I love you" when... you can't even say "I like you"?
I love you.
Say I like you first.
Step by step, okay?
Let me off.
No!
Come again!
I like you!
One more time!
I like you!
I like you!
I like you!
Bingo!
Bingo!
Bingo!
Once more...
These are the rules for backup lovers:
Dating schedule is agreed by both parties.
The backup lover should conduct oneself.
Backup will always be backup.
The identity will be a top secret.
It's for you.
What is it?
Open it.
So cute.
This is 17th December.
According to our contract, we should celebrate Christmas Eve... a week early.
This is our first Christmas Eve Together.
You remembered?
Merry Christmas.
Hey
What's the rush, have you got a plan to scam Kiki?
We are going inside.
Don't say a word without my consent.
Inside?
What for?
How come you have so many questions?
Just be smart.
880 thousands for this necklace is reasonable.
I'm sure my daughter will like it.
Yes, Mrs Wong.
Will you visit your daughter... in LA this year?
God
She said she will go skiing this Christmas.
Really?
Mrs Wong, should I carve...
"To my dear daughter,"
"Janet Wong, happy birthday!"?
Both necklaces need "From mommy", okay?
- Okay, no problem.
- Thanks.
- Not at all.
- Auntie Wong?
I am Owen.
Janet's classmate.
We met in LA... last summer.
Really?
Yes, Janet always says...
Her mom is so pretty and young you look more like her sister.
She is such a sweet heart to me.
Auntie, I'm so glad to bump into you here.
Me too.
- Hello.
- You're on your own?
No, my girlfriend and I came back for Christmas.
She is pretty.
Don't praise her.
She is just a silly sally.
Hi, I am Owen Chan.
I ordered a ring two days ago.
Can you check for me if it is ready or not?
- Okay, please wait a moment.
- Thank you.
Auntie, when will Janet come back?
Next week.
Next week?
I will leave in a couple of days
I miss her again.
Auntie, could you do me a favor?
What is it?
When I skied with her last year,
I accidentally broke my ski.
Janet is so nice that... she insisted on buying me a new one.
I want to pay her back.
It's nothing, it's okay.
No!
I don't like owing people money.
You are such a earnest youngster.
But I've only got US dollars.
That's too much!
Right, Janet's birthday is coming.
Maybe you can... choose a present for her.
As a birthday gift from me.
Then...
Okay.
Thank you.
Welcome.
Sir, I have checked for you.
But I can't find your order.
Can you double check for me?
- Okay, please wait.
- Thank you.
- Auntie, I am going to get married.
- Really?
- Yes.
- When?
I plan to propose later.
I've even booked a table.
So romantic.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
I plan to have the wedding next year.
You must come with Janet.
No problem.
I have your words.
Sir, do you mind giving me your ID... or credit card to check?
I'm so sorry.
I was robbed yesterday.
I lost both my ID and credit card.
I already told that silly Sally.
We are in Hong Kong not L.A.
And should keep her eyes on our belongings.
Sir, which is the design you like?
Let me check if we have it in stock.
Right.
Take a look.
That one!
We have that in stock.
I will take it then.
Okay?
Let me give you a cheque.
Sorry, Sir.
We don't accept cheque.
Then I will pay by US dollars.
Sorry, Sir.
I want to help you but this is our company...
Madam, I beg you.
This ring means a lot to me.
I plan to propose with it.
I will leave the day after tomorrow.
And it's my girlfriend's birthday today.
I beg you.
Please do me a favor.
I'm so sorry.
I'd like to help.
But this is our policy.
I beg you, Miss.
Just this once, please.
This ring means the world to me
I'm so sorry.
Owen,
This ring, I'll pay for you first.
No, how could I, Auntie?
Why not?
Your wallet was stolen, keep some money with you.
I will pay for your ring...
And you write me a cheque.
You are Janet's friend, of course I trust you!
Auntie.
It's okay...
Pack this ring.
Hurry up.
I got to check my teeth in Shenzhen.
If I have toothache,
I will complain to your Boss!
It's alright.
Bye-bye, Auntie.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.
Bye-bye.
You know her?
Only just met.
I saw her giving you money.
E226You scammed again?
They are counterfeits.
How did you scam her?
I'll show you something.
It's beautiful!
Can you do an ending for me?
What ending?
Youngsters these days are so passionate.
But the feeling is so sweet.
You have gone too far!
You asked me out, to take advantage of me.
I am helping you.
Help!
You are just toying with me!
Just in time.
What's in time?
Bobo.
What a coincidence?
Right.
Coincidence?
You know I work here?
I...
Who is this?
I am Henry.
Hello.
Your boyfriend?
You are Bobo's friend, right?
Nice to meet you.
You have good eyes for men.
No, I'm the lucky one to have Bobo.
I will let you two get on with it.
I've got a meeting.
Okay, Kiki.
Send my regards to Chun.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Have you finished?
You knew she works here?
Just doing what I was paid for.
So, feeling any better now you've shown off to her?
A little bit.
Hey!
Why did you scam that lady?
What?
There was time,
That's it for the day.
Thanks.
See you.
See you?
Right.
I have to do more planning.
Call you later.
I won't let go of you.
I will follow you wherever you go.
You said we are going to eat.
Why are we here?
You know her?
What?
I thought you are hungry, let's go.
What do you want today?
The usual.
Give me a bottle of cognac!
Be right back.
We're drinking?
You're heart broken and depressed.
Drinks can make it better.
Cognac, good stuff, cheers.
Hey...
Enough...
Have to down it if your glass is up.
Who said that?
Simon.
Simon?
Never heard Simon said that.
Cheers!
Hurry up.
Cheers.
- Finished!
- Come again!
- What the hell!
- The glass is still up.
The glass is down this time.
Come on, why are you so slow?
The glass is off the table again.
You got to drink 3 glasses each time.
Why?
Have you ever heard of "3 cheers"?
Yes.
Drink then!
Be quick...
Drink more!
Yes!
Bye.
Where are we drinking next?
Drink?
Just go to bed.
Don't leave me behind.
Jeez.
They said you are scamming me.
But I didn't agree.
You said you will help me.
You said you will revenge for me.
You need to keep your words.
Keeping the promise you made.
I trust you!
I trust you.
I trust you.
Hey, she got this drunk?
I'll give you 200 bucks to take her home.
I'll give you 200 more to piss off!
I don't know her.
You don't know her?
I saw you what you did with... your "Three cheers"
You deal with your own problem.
Drink!
Drink again.
Kid, drink with me!
Drink... drink!
It's this way.
This way.
Let me tell you... a big secret.
What?
I drank quite a lot.
Mom!
How long have you known my daughter?
Not very long.
Then why did you take her out to drink?
She wasn't happy.
I've already told her not to drink so much.
My daughter hasn't been happy for a year.
Don't you want her to be happy?
It's okay, auntie.
I promise you, Bobo will be happy soon.
That'll be great.
My daughter only looks like a tough person.
It'll hurt a lot if she meets another jerk.
What's your name?
I am Keung.
Have some tea.
Thank you.
Yo!
Brother!
Have you forgotten your bro?
Look at you, all dress up, must be quite well off.
Where have you been these days?
The night club in Dongguan has closed.
So I came back and see if anything else is on.
I've counted you in for a business.
Remember this chick?
Stop acting.
You scammed 100 thousands from her last year.
She is with a big shot gangster.
"Tall Man".
Going to get married next month.
What has it got to do with me?
Some bros and I are planning to kidnap her.
That's why we need you to... give her a call.
You know I am not into this stuff.
It's just a call.
It's nothing to you.
We won't bother you again.
Don't push me, if we are still bros.
Just think about it.
How did you buy tickets?
We were behind two bitches.
They answered everything...
Brad Pitt said.
And when Matt Damon talked, she answered for George Clooney
God,
I was not there to listen to them.
It's not my fault
I didn't know... they would be in front of us.
You are useless
I hate everything you do.
You've ruined my Christmas Eve.
Hey, Honey, where is my present?
How come I can't logon?
Wrong password.
Wrong?
I've changed the password.
Move up.
Why?
I can't type the password in.
You can just tell me.
Then what's the point of me changing the password.
Come again?
From now on, I'll logon for you when you need to.
Come on!
It's my computer!
What's your problem?
Is there something I can't see on your computer?
What?
This is my computer.
Why can't I own a password?
I won't tell you the password.
Beg me, ask me, when you need to logon.
You freak!
I'm your boyfriend, not your slave!
Why don't you just put a chain round me!
You shouting at me?
Let's break up.
Fine!
Come again!
Break up?
Fine!
Now!
I don't want to anymore.
Let me tell you, I'm in control of you.
In every single way I like!
Never mind, I'll give you the password.
You don't get it, we're not compatible
I should have agreed to break up with you the first time.
Fung, don't be mad.
You keep saying how your ex being bad to you.
But the both of you are no different!
Control freaks who never care about others' feelings!
Can you stop talking about him?
Mon, there are things you need to face.
Don't talk about him!
No!
- Mon...
- Stop!
Just break up...
Just go, and never come back again!
Your present is in your room.
Just leave!
I said leave!
BBB Calling
I got to stay at home tonight.
Enjoy yourselves.
Bye.
Who is it?
Jason asked us to go out and celebrate.
Why don't we go?
You always complain I have no time for you.
I'm handing myself over to you.
Let's have a trip during Valentine's Day.
I've never seen snow before.
It's boring to celebrate festivals at home all the time.
Okay.
You say that every time.
Then you need to work.
I'll take a shower.
- Why are you calling me?
- Mandy
I miss you.
I'm outside your house, can you come out and see me?
I told you we can't see each other today.
Why?
Mandy, I forgot my towels, can you get one for me?
Coming!
- Mandy...
- Bye.
Mandy.
Hey!
Stop it!
I only sneaked out since Wai's asleep.
Call a taxi.
Go home.
I won't.
I want to be with you.
You are with me...
Just not tonight.
Mandy, I don't just want to be your backup
I want to be the real deal.
Mon and I have broken up...
Just so you're clear!
I only promised to be your backup, not the real deal.
Mandy, I know you like me.
Why can't we be together?
It's timing, timing is important.
I can only have you as my backup.
We can't change that.
You do like me, if not...
Let go!
I sneaked out to tell you...
I have promised Wai to marry him tonight.
Why have you call me out in a rush?
We're having desserts.
Why did you bring me here?
Come on.
Let me go.
Stop!
To revenge, you need to face your enemy.
No...
Just be smart.
Bobo.
Bobo?
It's so nice of you to bring Bobo here.
I've read the desserts here are good.
So I brought Bobo here to try.
Who knew this is your shop.
Order what ever you want.
Okay.
Baby, what do you want?
I'll eat anything you order, baby.
Okay.
Baby loves mango pudding and...
I want green beans soup.
I forgot baby has a cough.
Cough.
You can't have this then.
Coconut milk with tree mushroom then.
Is it okay?
Okay.
Boss, we're in trouble.
The sesames are all burnt!
You are so careless.
I'm just a trainee, and Ming isn't here.
Call him to come back.
His son is getting marry in the Mainland.
What should we do?
Let me help you.
What do you know?
The sesame was always cooked by Boss...
No...
I mean Miss Kwong.
Let me help you.
How long have you been with him?
What's it to do with you?
Just curious.
Does he treat you well?
Better than you.
Have you ever thought of expanding the business?
Of course.
But you need quite a lot of capital.
Which the banks have a lot.
With the good business and fame.
Banks will be dying to lend you money.
I think if you expand the business as a franchise.
Selling your own brand, it can be great.
Looks like you've done some research.
I am interested in anything that can earn money.
We're quite alike.
What's with all the changes?
Doing meals and desserts.
Kiki said this is diversification.
To earn more money.
You need money?
No, she wants to save money to get marry...
If you are interested, give me a call.
Okay.
Bobo, thank you.
The sesame can last for a few days.
Ask Ming to come back as fast as possible.
I will.
Bobo, you are so kind.
Helping whole-heartedly even though the shop is not yours.
You haven't changed the name.
The shop is still called "Bobo's Dessert".
I thought you'd change it to "Kiki's Dessert".
She was afraid that the regulars wouldn't come.
Sorry.
Baby, let's go.
Let me carry it.
Thanks baby.
We haven't kissed today.
Let's go and watch a movie.
Okay.
Bye-bye.
Have you finished holding my arm?
Chun said he will marry Kiki soon.
Really?
I used to ask him when he'd marry me.
He said after the business is running smoothly.
Now the business is great, but I am no longer the boss.
When will you start revenging for me?
Very soon.
I can't wait any longer.
I'm afraid the next time I see Kiki, I'll explode.
Buy a knife and stabs her to death.
Calm down, you'll go to prison.
I've finally got you!
You're not so smart, are you!
?
Hello.
Closing so early?
Needs to visit my wife at the hospital.
She's still in hospital?
Yes, she has to stay for few more days.
Women illnesses, cause so much trouble.
Send my regards to your wife.
Okay.
Your girlfriend is such a nice girl.
You should treasure her or it's your lost.
Hear that, boyfriend.
Yes, girlfriend.
Let's kiss.
Let's go
Mon, someone's here for you.
You are...
I am May.
I don't know you.
I am Alex's girlfriend.
That day... you gave me this.
What do you want?
I want to thank you.
Thank me?
I have broken up with Alex.
Thanks for letting me know.
Did he hit you?
I know about his past.
I have asked his ex-girlfriends.
Did they... tell you...
He would apologize... when it starts... and says... he had too much to drink.
Couldn't control himself.
But when you forgive him, he would do it again.
Again and again, up to your limit.
Then he would call you 100 times a day.
If he can't find you, he would...
He would call your friends, your colleagues,
Shouts at them, and everyone will be afraid of you.
Did they tell you the same things?
I am fine.
Don't let him find you.
Half a year.
He will give up after half a year.
I'm going back to Toronto.
He'll never find me.
I come to thank you.
You are brave.
How did you know about Alex and I?
I saw your photos at his home.
You are much more happy now.
I know you have let go.
Really.
Thank you so much.
I think we can be friends.
Sorry, I am late.
It's my fault, giving you such a short notice.
It's okay.
What is it you want to talk about?
Last time you talked about expanding the business.
I've thought about it, I agree with you.
Of course.
The food industry is very vibrant and... the future looks good.
So I did some homework and want to discuss with you.
Would you mind?
You are prepared.
Like you,
I am interested in anything that can make money.
Through out this year,
I have learned how to run a dessert shop.
From stocking, manpower to packaging...
I have all the contacts.
I believe you have... got a plan already.
But something's missing.
What?
I knew you are a smart guys, when I first met you.
But I couldn't understand...
Why would you be with someone like Bobo?
She is my girlfriend.
You didn't need to speak that way.
I'm a straight forward person.
You don't seem to disagree.
So you must feel the same way.
Let me look at your work.
Hey, good news.
She is in the trap.
Come out.
Long time no see.
Really?
I always find you looking at me outside my shop.
Never.
I'm only on my way to eat here.
It doesn't matter anymore.
You wouldn't see me even if you come by tomorrow.
Why?
This is the last day of the shop.
The proprietor called back the shop.
What's your plan?
I plan to stay with my sister in Singapore.
She is pregnant again, the baby's due next month.
Will you come back?
I don't know.
It's good to make changes.
Maybe I will return to school.
I haven't decided yet.
Don't you miss anything here?
Is there anything I should miss?
I don't know, just curious.
Have you seen my sister's elder daughter?
So cute.
Right.
She is now 2 years old.
She called me "Auntie" last time.
Right, how is your sister?
She is fine.
She asked about you.
Me?
She told you to come and visit.
But I told her we haven't seen each other for a long time.
It has been a long time, I doesn't hold any grudges anymore.
My sister doesn't blame you.
How are you recently?
Are you still scamming people?
What question is that?
Of course not.
Stop scamming.
Grow up, be a mensch.
I know what to do.
This is my Singapore address, come visit us.
Okay, agreed.
I have to go.
Bye.
Bye-bye.
Yan...
What is it?
Take care.
You too.
I will be waiting for you.
Missy, you come at a good time.
Where is my friend?
He is really drunk.
How come?
After he spoke with the laundry girl, he made himself drunk.
We're here...
Sit down.
You are so drunk.
Why are you so nice to me?
Stop moving, you are drunk.
I'm scamming you.
Why are you so nice to me?
You're not scamming me.
I believe you won't scam me.
I'm not scamming you?
What am I?
A conman!
Why shouldn't I scam you?
You wouldn't have told me so much if you're scamming me.
She told me she want to see me.
How can I face her?
I scammed her.
I owed the loan shark.
I scammed all my girlfriend's sister's money.
It was me!
I scammed her...
I made her sister committed suicide.
She doesn't blame me, and asked me to visit?
Does she have a problem!
I would rather she hate me for life!
Who does she think she is?
Holy Mary, pitying me.
Don't talk like this.
Just cry, you'll feel better.
You feel guilty, it's a step forward.
You can change now you know you've done wrong.
I believe you, you can change.
Really?
I believe you.
Don't be upset.
You're not that bad.
Can do better though.
I'll cook for you when I have time.
Why the long face?
Not going to ask me in?
What now?
I told you I would come back.
I said I am not into it.
But the bros agree, it won't work without you.
How flattering.
Keung, help me this once.
Just make a call.
No matter what, you will get 500 thousands.
This is quite a good business.
You don't have to worry.
Will you hurt the girl?
Not even a string of hair.
We just want money.
So?
I won't rat on you even if I get caught.
I'll face the consequences.
Stop thinking!
I'll count you in.
Bye.
Right.
A familiar looking girl came downstairs... when I was waiting for you.
Where did I meet her?
You say you know every girl you meet.
Forget it.
Now you mention it, I want some action.
You cooked for the conman again?
Are you serious with him?
What are you talking about?
You paid him and... now you are serving him.
Why don't you just present yourself on a plate.
Hello?
You're not in love with him, are you?
What?
We are just friends.
That's better be the truth.
Luckily, we have different tastes.
I'll never choose a man you like.
That's great then.
At least we won't fall in love with the same guy.
You still haven't found your boyfriend?
Seems like he has vanished.
He will appear again sooner or later.
Great.
Now you're trying to teach me.
I talk to you and I get shot at.
I got it.
Talk later.
Bye.
Where have you been?
Can you grant me one wish before you get married?
In the backup lover contract, it states we should celebrate our birthdays with our partner first.
Backup lover can only celebrate before or after.
I would like to celebrate a week early.
This means today is my birthday.
I have already bought the tickets.
I've been waiting... to go on a trip with you.
You're such an idiot.
Didn't you say you want to see snow?
Why do you treat me so well?
'Cos I don't know how to treat you badly.
Next day, Mandy and I went to Japan.
Those were... the happiest fortnights of my life.
But time flies by, especially happy days.
You go first.
Can I still see you?
Of course.
Even after you become Mrs Li?
Thank you.
We are going to break up here?
Didn't we agree that on the plane?
Can I take back my words?
Don't act like a child.
But I really like you.
Like... and being together...
Has become two very different things.
We can only be each others backup.
Not starters.
Just like a football game.
Substitutes warms up and watches the game... on the sideline.
Time flies by.
But in the starting lineup...
The pressures are big.
And because we are backup...
We let things go easily.
If we are dating, every flaws will be seen.
We wouldn't be able to take it.
I'm getting married.
Let's remember our precious moment.
And forget about... the bad ones.
I like you.
I will always like you.
Quite good.
I will remember all the things you taught me.
Sorry, I was with someone else behind your back.
It's in the past.
Aren't you angry with me?
Since you left, I've learned a lot.
If there's a will to forget things, there's always a way.
Did something happen to you?
A lot.
Most importantly,
I know what kind of person I am.
Fung...
I miss you.
Me too.
I know I was horrible to you.
But I didn't mean to.
I don't know how to love.
Or it was because...
nobody had loved me before.
My temper was flaring at you everyday...
I only wanted you to know me better.
I have a lot to tell you...
But whenever I see you...
I don't know how to start.
Tell me.
I am willing to listen.
I don't mean to check your phone.
But it is one of... my hobbies.
I wish all the women you know...
Are fat, ugly and old.
When I am having my period,
I can show my temper.
It's only a few days every month.
When I'm throwing a temper, and tells you to stay away,
It's always a lie.
You must come looking for me.
Don't take it seriously... when I'm throwing a temper.
When I say it's wrong, it's right.
Whey I say no, I mean yes.
Do you understand what I am talking about?
When I run away in a street,
You must chase after me.
I don't want to search for your face...
By the reflection of a glass or mirror.
I say I want to go on diet.
But I actually want to hear you say,
"You are not fat.
I like you the way you are."
I am such an insecure person.
Because I love you too much.
I can't live without you.
Fung, don't leave me.
Has anyone told you a relationship needs timing.
We got together at the wrong time, it won't work.
You deserve someone better.
In fact, I am happy to... see you like this.
You've changed.
I am sure you can find someone you love...
Who loves you the same back.
Fung...
But I am not so lucky.
I am not the one.
Fung, no.
You should give freedom to the one you love.
Not trying to control.
A friend has just taught me that.
We should give each other more freedom.
Because we love each other.
Don't cry, silly.
We won't split up.
Because good friends never split up.
Sorry.
Not at all.
I just arrived.
Finished?
It took me all night.
I tell you, this is the perfect proposal.
This good?
Let me explain to you.
We share the 3 million in the first year.
We can borrow 1/3 from the bank.
It means you only pay 1 million up front.
I thought about it, we should open 3 shops first.
On HK island, aim at middle class.
Seeing the increasing percentage,
I think we can open up to 10 shops in 3 years.
This is awesome.
You think the numbers are accurate too?
I mean the color printing is awesome.
As a prop, it is like the real thing.
What prop?
The proposal is up to proper standards.
Thank you, Mark.
I am Henry.
I got it wrong.
Henry does finance.
Mark runs restaurant.
What, was it something I said?
Who told you?
Do you remember Tiffany?
Kiki, are you free to meet up?
You have some guts.
Scammed my little cousin and now me?
Then it's time for me to leave.
Wouldn't that be easy for you?
What do you want?
You've lost nothing, you want to call the cops?
That's not what I meant.
I want to do business.
Business?
Okay, let's talk.
I'm afraid you will tell my boyfriend too.
Then you will destroy my whole plan.
We value secrets, I can keep my mouth shut.
How much?
200 thousands.
Why?
Because of the shop you want to open.
Just think of it as decoration costs.
Or buy a lock to lock your mouth.
I like this metaphor.
How much did Bobo pay you to get close to me?
This is another business.
If I ask you to double cross her...
How much?
This early?
Yeah, I've cooked you some soup.
It's only been a few days, so messy already?
No, it's just the same.
It's okay.
I will clean it up.
Eat the soup first.
I got to go to the toilet.
Okay.
Hey, a visitor.
Go and open it.
Morning, Bobo.
Why didn't you make a call first?
I want to surprise you.
Looks like you're not the surprised one.
Did you tell her?
I've had enough.
Bobo, it's through.
I know your plan.
What are you talking about?
You wanted to scam me?
Not so easily.
You tell me...
Why is this happening?
We've been having fun for a long time.
That's enough.
I know...
You are lying.
You are acting.
You're always like this, don't know when you are faking it.
Tell me, you are lying.
You said you would help me.
You said you wouldn't scam me.
Nobody trusts you, except me.
You are so stupid.
He is a conman...
If he doesn't scam you, how does he live.
Shut up!
Bitch!
What have I ever done to you.
Why do you keep stealing my things.
I don't think of it as stealing, just fighting.
Good things need to be fight for.
I don't think I am wrong.
But I am your friend.
Then you should be more understanding.
But, I've never treated you as my best friend.
So I don't have to consider your feelings.
Bitch!
- Come here!
- Are you mad...
- I'm going to kill you!
- Let go!
Are you crazy!
Have you finished!
Go!
Go!
I don't want to see you!
Go!
I hate you.
I hate you!
I hate you!
Are you satisfied?
20 thousands for this.
It's some easy money.
Just give me the money.
It was really fun.
I felt so great... to see her in tears.
How about, I double the price.
For you to trick her again.
You finished?
Please leave.
What is it?
I'm not doing business with you...
Why are you so angry?
Are you crazy?
Why don't you give your money to charities, bitch.
A conman teaches me to become a good person?
Is it hurting you?
Or did you want me to make the poor girl leave?
So you are in love with her.
At least she knows how to cry.
How about you?
You are cold blooded.
Forget it.
How can you teach me?
We are two of a kind.
I'll let you look into your conscience.
But I got to thank you.
I have given your proposal... to the bank.
They said it is very detailed and... will lend me the money.
I'm going to sign the contract now.
Let me be honest for a moment,
It's such a waste... for you to be a conman.
If we can work together, it would be great.
Bye-bye.
Hello?
Chun!
Chun... are you okay?
Are you okay?
What happened?
No...
I've got nothing...
Where is Kiki?
She took my staffs.
My money and stocks.
Her shop is opening across the street next week.
What should we do?
Bobo, sorry.
I shouldn't have left you.
I deserve this!
I deserve this...
Don't talk about this now.
We shouldn't talk about this right now.
We should focus on the business, right?
Business?
She even took the pots and pans.
What business?
We can't be defeated this easily.
Relax, I got a plan.
I have brought all the utensils here.
- What for?
- Put it in the kitchen.
Dad.
Have you called the fruit suppliers' buddies?
They're here.
Sweet heart, why did you order so much fruit?
Making dessert for the shop.
Quick, inside...
- Coming...
- What has this shop got to do with you?
Why not?
Didn't you see, the sign still reads,
"Bobo's Dessert"?
Boss!
Boss!
We were wrong.
Please forgive us.
Please employ us again.
Let us come back to work.
Look, we've got my uniform back on.
I thought you two are working at Kiki's?
Don't mention that bitch!
She just vanished before the shop opened.
We couldn't find her.
We heard she owes some loan shark money.
How come?
Since we don't have enough staffs... we'll let you come back.
But remember, work hard.
- Yes!
Thanks!
- I got it...
Haven't work for ages.
What's happened to Kiki?
Why, you worry about her?
No.
But she's so smart, how did this happen?
Anyway, a package for you.
For me?
Yes.
I'll go inside and keep my eye on them.
Master!
How's the Taiwanese girl?
Are you Miss Fung?
Yes.
I'm Mr. Wong.
Manager Cheung is sick today.
I'm here to represent him to discuss the loan.
What a coincidence?
Yes, he went to the Mainland.
When he got back, he started suffering from fever.
Let's discuss upstairs.
Fine.
But... now...
Since we think Manager Cheung has contracted the bird flu, we are sterilizing the office.
If you don't mind, we can go upstairs.
Then... maybe we can discuss in a cafe.
Miss Fung.
I have read your proposal, it is very detailed.
We are happy to lend you the money.
Thank you so much.
In fact, the prospect is good for your business.
I go to your shop quite often myself.
Excuse me, I got to take medicine.
Chinese medicine?
So cute?
Yes, this is my family recipe.
For relieving internal heat.
Family recipe?
Have you ever heard of "Wong Lui Kit"?
He is my great grandfather.
Is it not the famous Chinese medicine store?
Yes.
He is my great grandfather.
I am Wong Sik Guak.
We are named according to our family book.
Tradition thing.
I've never thought... you are so well off.
Well off.
What's well off?
Very rich.
We've only got about 20 shops.
But we plan to expand to the Mainland next year.
How many shops are you planning to open?
99 shops in the first year.
To around 500 shops in 5 years time.
Comparing my business to yours...
I'm like Jack compare to the bean stalk.
Forgive my intrusion...
But your plan is very good.
You don't have to borrow from the bank.
A lot of people are willing to lend you the capital.
- Really?
- Yes.
Like us.
We are interested in doing dessert.
You can discuss with us.
But you are running... such a big business.
There's no big and small to business.
We can discuss about the details later.
What's important is, if you are interested?
Of course.
That's great.
But...
About Manager Cheung, if...
Relax, I won't answer his calls.
I can't believe...
This is the first time we've met, we are so alike.
Because we are both interested in making money.
True.
Since then,
I've arranged a few meetings with her.
Got some extras to play the parts.
That's what I called acting.
I told her... you need to show your sincerity doing business.
Since we're paying out few billions.
A few millions from her would be reasonable.
I never thought she would dare to borrow from loan sharks.
Look at the loan shark, scary eh?
You didn't have to scam her for so long, did you?
Master, I didn't expect the girl... would asked me to be her boyfriend.
So I took her on some trips.
Take a look at these.
You're a conman not a gigolo.
She's hot.
Poor you.
Master, your share.
I don't want it.
It's not like you.
Have you dealt with that 100 thousands?
Into the account as you have asked.
You really don't want it?
It's yours.
You got money now.
Leave this business.
Get a real job.
But I am on fire.
I have tried to persuade you.
I'll retire.
Take care.
What are you going to do?
- Be myself.
- Can you?
Years ago, someone asked me to do this.
But I couldn't.
Recently I met someone else, she said I can.
So I want to give it a shot.
Master, are you in love?
You sound Jane Austen...
But looking at you, you look heart broken.
Maybe there wasn't any romance.
I can't provide what she needs.
Right, the mountain areas in the Mainland lack resources.
I have done some research.
A toilet need 300 bucks, 3000 for a pig, 5000 for a cow.
And a year tuition fee for a primary school child, it's 500.
I plan to send some resources... through the charities in HK.
You've earned so much, it will be nice...
If you contribute.
Master!
You've... thought of a peach of an idea.
Scamming children and pigs.
Awesome.
Count me in.
I will count my friends in too.
You bastard.
Count me in!
Never mind.
Auntie.
- Here.
- Thanks... have a slice of beef.
Thank you, auntie.
Excellent, the shop is open.
Boss!
It's you again.
I've just got off the plane.
You look so happy, are you pregnant?
What?
What would you like?
Hotpot.
Move...
I'll get you a bowl.
I'll make myself at home.
I can have dessert later.
Where did you come back from?
Silk Road.
Have you got any souvenirs?
Yes...
I was just kidding...
More food.
Camel's leg.
What's your name?
Call me Cousin.
Cheers!
Yo!
Pretty.
Want to be my girlfriend?
Say something.
Damn it!
It's boring!
- What's funny...
- Gutted.
Still laughing!
Find something to do.
Do what... woman?
Great... where's the woman?
How about the school girl from the other afternoon.
- You only talk!
- You don't believe me?
I'll show you.
And since that day,
I felt very uncomfortable.
So I followed Bobo every day...
On her way to and from school.
I'm scared that Lui will be true to his words.
Chun.
What is it?
Someone is stalking me.
Forget it, let's go.
A week later.
Lui and I was sentenced to juvenile centre... for robbery.
And I haven't seen Bobo since.
Hey.
How's business?
Where's your girlfriend.
Can I have a slice?
Sorry, sold out.
This one is for a regular customer.
He called to order.
It's okay.
Did you have a fight with your girlfriend?
Girls nowadays love to hide their feelings.
And only feel the love, if the guys keep guessing.
It's cold tonight, go home and make up.
Say "Sorry, I love you".
It's just a few words.
Sometimes, you don't get a second chance.
I'll come again.
Remember to bring your girlfriend.
Of course.
Hey
Hey, working so late?
I just saw your boyfriend.
My boyfriend?
Yes, are you two playing hide and seek?
Honey.
Honey.
Are you feeling better?
Much better.
She is so nice, always asking how you are.
You are fighting with your boyfriend?
Arguing with your boyfriend?
Men never think with their heads.
They don't know they are making others angry.
It's just women are more forgiving.
At least you know that.
He used to be a gambling addict.
I was going to marry someone else instead.
But he came crying and begged me to stay.
So I asked if he is willing to change.
He said yes and I believed him.
That was a few decades ago.
You just like my good looks.
But he really hasn't gamble since.
If he really likes you, he will change.
If you don't ask the question, you'll regret it.
Go and look for your boyfriend.
He couldn't have gone too far.
Okay, I will come back.
- Bye-bye.
- Bye-bye.
Don't move!
Police.
We suspect you are related to a kidnapping case.
- Let go!
- Come with us!
Move!
- What for, Sir?
- Get into the car.
Go...
It won't just be a broken arm next time, okay!
Blame it on your bro who betrayed you.
My boss warns you not to touch his women again.
Bobo.
Where did you go?
I thought I saw an old friend.
So I came out to take a look.
Did you find him?
It was some one else.
Look.
Where did you get it?
I'm a regular customer.
Come on.
They are waiting us.
I can't provide what she needs.
Hello?
It's me.
Where have you been?
Why haven't you called me?
We are talking now...
Bobo.
I... am dating.
Really?
Congratulations!
Thank you!
How about you?
I will open a new shop next month.
And I'm getting married soon.
Really?
Congratulations.
Why don't we meet up?
Yeah, I've heard that before.
I mean it, we've never met in person.
True.
Do you remember how we met?
Trade this...
Miss, stealing your boyfriend's mobile again?
This one is newer.
Just shut up and check.
Hey, it's ringing.
How can you trade in without taking out... the SIM card?
No ID.
I'm not answering.
You stole it.
Okay, okay.
Bonjour?
Do you do plumbing here?
You've got the wrong number.
Do you know where can I find a plumber?
My shop's sewage pipe is broken.
If it wasn't for your sewage pipe
I wouldn't have known you.
Yuck.
What?
That's what happened.
After that call, you met Fung?
That's all in the past, let's forget it.
Didn't you say your boyfriend is coming?
He is.
There's a traffic jam.
But my baby is really awesome.
How awesome?
Where did you meet him?
He was a customer at the bar.
He came one night when he was heart broken.
His eyes are so thoughtful.
You know I love this type.
We've talked for so long,
I should know you quite well.
Let me guess what he looks like.
Okay.
He... is tall.
Short hair, wears glasses.
He is polite.
Smile all the time.
Morning.
He is... gentle, neat and tidy.
I told you I know you well.
Right.
Someone's here.
This must be my baby.
What does he do?
Same as your boyfriend.
He owns a dessert shop.
- Baby.
- Honey.
I'll never choose a man you like.
At least we won't fall for the same guy.

CRYING FOR LOVE
Can a receptionist not have breasts?
She only has one breast.
It looks weird.
We can't do that.
We can't display illness like that.
- Good morning.
Did you have a nice Christmas?
- I don't celebrate it.
I see.
Don't you believe in Santa Claus either?
Christmas is a crock of shit.
I have the result of your CAT scan.
The tumor is in your neck, near your spinal cord.
Its grown.
We can operate, but its complicated and very risky.
You could be paralyzed, or at worst, die during surgery.
What, Mette?
Is something wrong?
- Is Martin on his way?
Stop ringing the bell as soon as your mother leaves.
Its so quiet here.
Hi, Martin.
Hi, Mette.
First you get the sleeping medicine, Stephanie.
Then Ill put on the mask.
Just breathe calmly, alright?
Think of something pleasant.
Well take good care of you while you're asleep.
Here's the mask.
There we go.
Now take a deep breath.
Think of something pleasant.
A nice vacation.
Maybe a good beach.
A blue ocean.
TWO YEARS AGO
The results show cellular abnormalities in your uterus.
Good morning.
Happy birthday.
How sweet of you.
There you go.
Read the card first.
- Okay.
I love you too.
Now you open your gift.
Maybe you can wear it later.
Maybe.
Its lovely.
Do you want to put it on?
- Yes.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
Hi.
- Hi.
How are you feeling?
Like Freddy Krueger beat me up.
How about you?
I saw that Mette was back.
Mette, take the pill.
Its not as bad as you think.
You'll feel better and more relaxed.
Thank you.
See you tomorrow morning.
TWO DAYS AGO
Here.
- Thanks.
You should have gone.
You know we wont leave you by yourself.
Here.
You're going back the day after tomorrow, right?
Are you okay?
- Yeah.
More water?
- No.
Hey, hey!
Quiet down.
Your sister is resting up for tonight.
Hi.
- Hi.
Did you have fun?
- Yeah.
No!
Alright?
- Yes.
Are you doing okay?
- Yeah.
Hey, Lulu and Villads.
Go out and play in the garden.
Its fine, Mom.
- Hi.
Did you take your medicine?
Yes.
How was the service?
- Fine.
Like every Christmas Eve.
More fluff than content.
- Could they sit still?
Villads couldn't.
- I didn't think so.
Did you get some sleep?
- A little.
Dad wrote it all down.
If you feel better later, we can do those exercises.
I don't want to.
Do you need anything?
Hi.
- Hi.
What are you doing here?
I didn't feel well on Christmas Eve.
My parents didn't know what to do.
How about you?
Its gotten bigger.
- Now what?
An operation.
You sure got a lot of Christmas cards.
And best wishes for the new year.
And a necklace, skis and hair clips.
Hand me my water.
Your turn, Stephanie.
I broke up with Oliver because...
- Because you got sick?
Aren't you in love with him?
- Yes.
Very much.
But I didn't want to upset him.
Doesn't that make sense?
Not really.
I've never had a boyfriend.
But you've slept with a boy, right?
No.
I have to pee.
- Why don't you use that?
Thanks.
What should we do New Years Eve?
- Make hats.
Ill write a speech.
- Come on.
Hats and speeches?
Then I will definitely need booze.
I want my whole family to come.
I only have my father.
- Cant it just be the three of us?
Like a VIP party?
Only cancer patients are admitted?
A YEAR AGO
What's up?
Has he left?
- He didn't come.
I trained alone.
But are you disciplined enough?
- You should leave.
My father says I'm not focused.
He says my thoughts are elsewhere.
What should we do about that?
- Its not funny.
My practice is suffering.
Because of me?
- No.
Actually you're my inspiration.
I know how you can inspire me.
- Kenneth, Sara!
Lights out.
Lock the door when you leave.
- Yeah.
See you.
No.
Not here.
No one can see us.
- No.
I mean it.
Stop it.
Look at this nice place.
- Yes.
We could practice there.
We could stay for three months.
Three months?
- Is that a problem?
No, not at all.
Its just a long time to be away from ones things.
You're used to traveling.
And we just moved here.
You haven't made a lot of friends.
- No, but still...
Well do other things.
Relax and have fun.
Do you want something to eat?
- No thanks.
You haven't eaten today.
- I'm not feeling well.
You really have to focus now.
That's why its a good idea to get away.
You'll feel a little jab.
Does it hurt a lot?
- No.
Put pressure on it for about a minute, alright?
Bye.
Have you thought about where you want to go?
New Zealand?
Thailand?
No.
You have your scan tomorrow.
Are you nervous?
No.
Of course you're not nervous.
I love you, sweetie.
My father cant take this at all.
- My parents broke down.
Its no wonder.
Death row.
That's what this is.
We sit around and wait till its over.
They know it.
- Do you have to be so negative?
Why don't you ask your parents to come?
It doesn't have jack to do with that.
And by the way, they're busy.
- So are mine.
But they come when they can.
Who wouldn't put their children first?
Shut up.
You don't know anything.
- They don't care about you.
There's no love.
- What religious bullshit!
She doesn't mean it.
- Yes, I do.
Wont you stay for a while?
See you tomorrow.
I didn't mean it.
Mom...
- What happened?
Oh, dear.
Lets wash it and put on a band-aid.
Where did it happen?
Out in the garden?
Stephanie didn't mean it.
She's just scared shitless shell die before her parents get here.
Why doesn't she take the morphine?
- She wont take the pills.
She has enough to kill an elephant, but she thinks they'll tempt her to die.
What does that have to do with me?
Does it go with your clothes?
What are you doing?
Nothing.
How about a movie before we go to Tei's place?
Now?
- Yes.
I'm sorry about yesterday.
Its none of my business.
That's okay.
- No, its not.
Can you forgive me?
It doesn't matter.
Come on.
Do you have more paper?
This is ugly.
This is ugly too.
- Thanks.
My parents don't know I'm sick.
What do you mean?
Don't they know how serious it is?
I mean that they don't know I'm sick.
Not at all?
- We haven't spoken for five years.
My mother was seriously ill when I was 17.
My parents asked me not to move - till my dad could take a leave of absence a year later.
What happened?
A whole year.
My dad had to quit his job.
He refused to get home help for her.
Have they refused to talk to you since then?
I haven't answered their letters ever since.
Stephanie, that's crazy.
They have a right to know that their daughter is sick.
I wasn't there for them.
Why should they be there for me?
Parents always understand.
- No.
Cant someone here help you?
- I said no.
They hate me.
Years shall overtake us
Years go gliding past us
Man's generations forward roll
Never it ceases
The heaven-sent music
Filling with joy the pilgrim's soul
Dad.
Here.
- Thanks.
Aren't you coming back down?
- No.
Okay.
Sleep tight.
- You too.
Come down if you feel like it.
- Okay.
Oscar, don't.
- Ill just be a minute.
Hi.
Are you waiting for the night bus?
- No.
Are you going out?
- On Christmas Eve?
Haven't you ever done that?
- Oscar, I'm fucking freezing.
Are you waiting for someone?
- My brothers picking me up.
Your brother?
Here?
- Yes.
You're waiting on a bench at 2 a.m. On Christmas Eve for your brother.
Yes.
- Okay.
Exciting.
Fuck her and get it over with.
- Shut up.
You go on ahead.
- Is she coming or what?
Lets go!
You can come if you like.
Everyone is welcome.
No.
- Okay.
Merry Christmas.
Bye.
Wait.
Then come.
Come on.
1.10.
- Okay.
What do you mean by okay?
1.10.
What's going on?
Nothing.
- You're slower than last Monday.
Maybe I'm tired.
- You have to take this seriously.
I do.
- No, you don't, sweetie.
Your times have been stable, but now you lose a second per lap.
You're not concentrating.
- I am.
You're not.
From now on you're practicing four hours a day.
Here.
Eat.
Dad?
When I see how you're taking this...
I know that you'll get well.
Here's your breakfast.
No, I can do that.
- Is there something else you'd like?
Would you close the door behind you?
Hi, Andreas.
Hi, Steph.
- Hi.
Long time, no see.
You look good.
Forget the beer.
A drink?
- Two vodka and cranberry.
Make them doubles.
- Sure.
Hey!
Could I have your attention?
Shut up!
Turn the music off.
Thanks.
Id like to welcome you to my new apartment.
And today is someone's birthday.
Stephanie's.
Lets sing a birthday song for her.
- No.
Do you want to go out for a smoke?
Why didn't we two ever...
- Your girlfriend got pregnant.
She isn't now.
Hey.
What's this?
Someone's looking for trouble.
Fuck.
Hey, asshole!
Hey!
Lets just go.
Hello?
- Oliver?
Is that you?
Stephanie.
- How are you?
Fine.
Fine.
Where are you?
What are you up to?
I just want to talk to you.
- Okay.
When?
Hello?
Steph?
Steph, can you call me later?
Sure.
I will.
So you've fixed a date.
- We certainly have.
Tomorrow.
Tomorrow?
- Its New Years Eve.
Yes, I'm sorry.
The sooner, the better.
We had a cancellation, so...
Then Ill be asleep at midnight.
- Yes, you will.
But Ill get better.
- Yes.
It will be fine.
Good!
Give it your all.
Good!
Put your back into it on the final stretch.
Come on.
The last bit.
Come on!
Now what?
What are you doing?
There, there, sweetie.
Come here.
Are you alright?
You need oxygen.
Ill take your goggles off.
Lie down and put your feet up.
Lie down.
You didn't have enough breakfast, did you?
There, there.
Are you pregnant or what?
Who is he?
No one.
Is it the holy spirit?
- No.
You don't know him.
I see.
That's fine then.
Don't people use condoms anymore?
Is he your steady boyfriend?
Are you getting married?
Must you know?
- No.
Have you told him?
No.
- He has no idea?
Right.
Okay.
Well get an appointment for next week.
As soon as possible.
And then well continue training.
No one will have found out.
Well make it, right?
This is Torben.
Hi, Preben.
No, she's fine.
She was just indisposed.
No, well stick to lane 7.
- What if I didn't have an abortion?
No, I'm still here.
Let me call you back, Preben.
Fine.
Bye.
We've been training for seven years.
This is your big chance.
This is it.
You wont have this opportunity again.
I have to know if this is what you want.
Is this what you want?
Yes.
- Are you sure?
Yes.
Yes, of course I am.
Good.
I don't want to be a grandfather just yet.
Is she poorly?
- Let her sleep.
Don't wake her.
- I wont.
The procedure starts with a pill here in the clinic.
That starts the abortion.
There's no going back.
Its important to have an adult nearby.
Do you have someone?
Sweetie?
Tell me what's wrong.
- Sara!
Sara!
- She's asleep.
Sara!
Sara!
Come downstairs.
- I want to talk to you.
- Take care.
Goodbye.
Dear Kenneth.
What I'm doing, what I did you'll probably never understand.
It felt right at first, but then it got too hard.
When I see you, all I feel is a hard little rock in my stomach.
Here.
- This is great.
Soon you'll beat your time.
- Lets do another lap.
It's not your fault.
And I don't understand it either.
I'm sorry.
Love, Sara.
What's wrong?
What is it?
Does your stomach hurt?
- I have a cramp.
Come and sit down.
Jesus.
This has never happened before.
New Years Eve?
We were supposed to be together.
Great party when a third of the guests decline.
I'm sorry.
- It doesn't matter.
Where are you going?
What's that?
- Our New Years party.
Its not till tomorrow.
- On our ward its today.
They say that above the clouds
The sky is always blue
It can be hard to understand when you can't see it
They say that after the storm has raged
The sun always comes out
But that rarely helps those who are already wet
When friends disappear
And life is hard
You look at everything with different eyes
You practice and slowly you get better at seeing
And distinguishing between truth and lies
Everything can break
A heart can break into a thousand pieces
If you once considered me a friend
I'm probably still here
That was our last party together.
- Well stay in touch.
I know how it ends.
A few phone calls that eventually peter out.
And suddenly Ill never hear from you again.
What nonsense!
Well all stay in touch.
Maybe we should clean up.
When I lay me down to rest - 13 angels stand around me.
Two smile on my right.
Two walk on my left.
Two stand guard at my pillow.
Two more at my feet.
Two cover me, two awaken me.
And one shows me all the heavenly paradise.
Hi!
How are you?
Hey, wait a minute.
Hey.
Hey.
- Sorry.
For what?
- I shouldn't have come.
I shouldn't have talked you into it.
How will you get home?
- Ill take a taxi.
You cant get one now.
Its Christmas Eve.
You can spend the night at my place if you want.
I mean on a mattress.
I have an extra mattress that you can have.
Or on the couch or the floor.
Or I could sleep on...
Do you want to?
I wont do anything.
I know its all my fault.
I'm all alone.
Oliver, I don't have anyone.
Come here.
Can you forgive me?
Yes.
I can.
What are you doing?
Go back to sleep.
Please don't.
How can you stand it?
- Please don't.
You mustn't.
If you do that, Ill never forgive you.
Stop it.
My phone...
- What?
I need my phone.
- Where?
Ill get a doctor.
- Don't leave me.
Cant you come now?
Why not?
Why?
Are you feeling poorly?
You need your oxygen.
I want my parents to come.
- Easy, Mette.
Call my parents.
- Did you take your pill?
Please call my parents.
Its 4: 15 a.m.
- I can tell that...
Are you okay?
Oh no.
Fuck.
You have to take the morphine pills.
Promise me.
You need rest.
See you tomorrow.
- Don't leave.
Hold me.
- Mette, go to sleep.
Am I disgusting?
- No.
You think I'm gross.
- No.
Yes, you do.
- Try to get some sleep.
Your parents will be here in the morning.
I feel really sick.
Sara.
Sara.
Sara.
You have to come.
Mette is in a bad way.
What?
- Mette is in a really bad way.
How is she?
- I gave her a morphine drip.
She had an anxiety attack.
Her parents are taking the first plane.
They'll be here soon.
THE NEW TESTAMENT
Mom?
This is my fault.
What do you mean?
Of course its not your fault.
I took her pills.
She tried to stop me.
Mette?
Mette, are you awake?
Mom?
Mom?
Are you there?
Mom?
- I'm right here.
I knew you'd come.
- Go to sleep now.
Were here now.
- I knew you'd come.
Mette died last night.
Yes.
I know.
She was so scared.
Yes.
Dad?
I don't know if I want to have the operation.
I'm scared.
I'm not as brave as you think.
Sweetie...
Are you disappointed?
Don't do it if you don't want to.
Don't do it for my sake.
You are brave.
You have the courage to say you're scared.
That's brave.
I'm not disappointed.
Of course I'm not.
You're the best thing in my life, and I would do anything for you.
I understand why you're afraid of the operation.
I would be too.
But if you want it, now's the time.
Ill be there the whole time.
The whole time.
You'll make it.
Yes.
There were problems.
Sara's brain didn't get enough oxygen.
Is she dead?
- No.
But she's in a coma.
Do you understand what I'm saying, Stephanie?
It doesn't look too good.
Can I see her?
- Not right now.
Torben is with her.
Maybe you should take a sedative.
Dear Stephanie.
When someone dies, it should mean something to the world.
It has to make a difference.
Someone has to be affected.
Someone has to grieve.
And no one must die alone.
That goes for you too, Stephanie.
Love, Sara.
Mom?
Its me.
Subtitles:
Karen Margrete Wiin Dansk Video Tekst
Veit Harlan was the Third Reich's most successful film director.
His films were seen by more than 1 00 million viewers throughout Europe.
After World War ll he was tried twice for crimes against humanity because ofhis anti-Semitic film jew Süss.
He was acquitted both times.
He is a jew!
I recommend you do not miss the next mail coach.
Why?
I have business in Stuttgart.
Indeed, I wanted a recommendation for a hostel here.
There are none that take in jews.
In my history book, when I was at college, there was a small photo from jew Süss underneath which was written:
jew Süss by Veit Harlan.
And it was then I realized that this was my name.
That was difficult for me.
"Reichsführer-SS:
I wish that measures be taken to ensure that all SS men and policemen see jew Süss during the winter.
Reichsführer-SS, Heinrich Himmler."
It became a murder weapon.
And once you've seen that the fruit of your work turns into a murder weapon, it is difficult to just say,
"I am a filmmaker and will carry on making films."
That was the end for me.
That's where my, let's say, extreme prejudice towards him comes from.
The image I have of my father is mine.
And it's nobody's business what I think of my father or of my mother.
It's true to say that my father was really a rather apolitical person.
He was an artist and just got carried away.
What took place is not really forgivable.
Only his work counted, nothing else.
Only the realization of his plans counted.
Rrofessor Veit Harlan at the UFA premises.
He is the director of such epic films as
The Great King and the color film The Golden City.
I think he was a fellow traveler, an ambitious man who got himself the career he wanted.
Stanley of course asked himself the same questions:
If I had been in his position, what would I have done?
If I had recognized it in time, would I have been afraid?
The people are rising upl
The people are rising upl
The storm is breaking loosel
So, my grandfather...
Veit Harlan.
My grandmother,
Hilde Körber.
And then a second wife,
Kristina Söderbaum, an actress from his films.
And then Hilde Körber and Veit Harlan had three children:
Thomas Harlan, my father, then Maria,
and then the third sibling, Susanne.
Susanne had one daughter, jessica.
Thomas married Luisa.
They had a son,
Chester.
Then... he met my mother,
and here I am.
Veit Harlan got married again, this time to Kristina Söderbaum.
They had two sons:
Kristian, and Caspar.
And I know that Caspar has three daughters:
Lotte,
Lena and Nele.
Ladies and Gentlemen, we are glad to welcome you to this... exhibition:
jew Süss an NS propaganda film here at the Haus der Geschichte Baden-Württemberg.
I appreciate your interest in this exhibition focusing on a film.
In 1 948/ 49, Veit Harlan was one of very few artists to be prosecuted for crimes against humanity for having made this very film.
Let us start in the first exhibition room.
Veit Harlan was born in 1 899, the son of playwright Walter Harlan.
He is one of six children.
Veit Harlan was a volunteer during the First World War, then became a stage actor and married his jewish colleague, Dora Gershon.
It was a brief marriage.
He married his second wife, Hilde Körber, in 1 929.
He always maintained that he was an actor.
It was very important to him.
It was where he came from, his basis for directing.
It made him very capable of dealing with actors.
His method of directing was very much that of guiding his actors.
I think he considered acting as his roots.
Veit Harlan and Hilde Körber worked together on several films.
Harlan was an upcoming director,
Hilde Körber one of the most popular actresses of the '30s.
We children were aware of the fact that our parents didn't fit together,
and that they couldn't live together in peace.
They were too different.
My father was often loud and crude, and she was of a very tender nature.
My mother was like a harp to my father's kettledrum.
But I did love my father too, and his rowdiness, his laughter and his craziness.
He'd climb the stairs on all fours, throw and catch me.
I loved it.
Father, Veit Harlan, mother, Hilde Körber.
- How old were you when they divorced?
- Ten!
- Was this hard for you?
- Yes.
This was simply because my mother no longer wanted us to see our father, but I very much wanted to.
Voilá.
- Did you like him?
- Very much.
As he did you, his only son at that time.
The only son and his favorite, the most important one of all.
Thomas, Susanne and Maria Harlan.
Three very different siblings.
They enjoy a privileged childhood in the Third Reich, though their parents'divorce casts its shadow.
Goebbels?
I only met him when he came to Tannenberg Allee.
He had come there for a meeting with our father.
I was four or five, I guess.
We were told the minister was coming, were put in dresses.
Then he came, we gave a curtsy, he patted our heads, and we went off to play.
And the two of them withdrew to my father's study and discussed what they should do.
ln the Gerhardt Hauptmann adaptation The Ruler,
Harlan employed NSDARslogans and propagated the Nazi cult of the genius.
The film, starring Germany's most famous actor, Emil jannings, received prestigious awards.
It was Harlan's breakthrough.
Not only Goebbels, but Hitler too noticed the talented director who was so capable in lacing artistic drama with ideological content.
On my death I shall leave the works I created to the State.
That is to say, our national community.
I am convinced that from amongst the workforce that helped me to create these works, the man will come forth who has a calling to further my endeavors, be he from the furnace or from the desk, the laboratory or the work lathe.
I wish to teach him only that which a parting man may teach one who is newly arrived.
He who is born to lead needs no other teacher than his own genius.
I've never seen an artist more loved than my father was after the war.
On the streets, whenever I gave my name.
Incredible!
Everyone would fall silent, would say...
"Those were great moments."
Their souls had been touched.
He could have played on that much more.
But anyway, it's unique that someone should so perfectly touch a nerve throughout his public.
It must have been in the 50s or the 60s, one of the people at the studio had a copy of it and said,
"It may be forbidden, but watch this."
And on a monitor this size he showed me scenes from jew Süss.
It was terribly difficult, we had to keep a lookout.
There were these little figures...
I didn't comprehend that it is malignant or how well or badly the actors play.
It meant nothing to me.
And I thought, "It was for this that he was prosecuted?
I don't get it."
And as an old soldier I say:
If thejew means to do abhorrent deeds with our womenfolk, it is up to you, your Grace, to stop him short.
Do you dare reproach me?
I'll have you imprisoned!
You cannot imprison all Württembergers, your Grace.
That I can, rebels!
Then,just after I had turned 7 0,
I was invited to a closed showing of the film in the Urania Cinema.
And it left me speechless.
I just wept and was in despair.
And I couldn't even imagine that my father had really done this.
And this film that everyone found so good,
I didn't even find good.
I thought that Krauss really overacted, and intentionally made it as sleazy as possible.
I found it horrific.
I felt like going outside and puking.
jew!
jew!
Mr. Trenk, this is thejew's doing.
Leave her be.
- Kill him!
- Kill the villain!
Thejew has to go!
Thejew has to go!
I found the film particularly repulsive.
I found Kristina's role... repulsive.
And my father was very sad about it.
My mother, who had two half-jewish sisters was horrified.
It got to me really badly, the mentality that it represented.
I could say the same of The Golden City.
The quality of the acting and directing was irrelevant to me.
It was the mentality behind it that got to me.
People obviously didn't catch that anymore in Germany in 1 940.
Can't have been, given the success the film had.
My daughter will bear nojewish children.
- I see.
- We understand each other then.
It might prove dangerous to reject the suit of a man in my position.
I found the film shocking.
For sure.
And why?
Because of the scenes, the way it was filmed, and the reaction it caused.
The echo...
The film remains his trademark, his black flag.
I could have seen it last year, but I didn't want to hear people criticizing, discussing, or berating it.
I would have felt attacked.
Now I think it would be okay.
And now I've seen the film.
It's full of caricatures, Ifind it grotesque.
And I can't understand its success.
Because this is no great film.
I'd imagined it as starker and more brutal.
Because this film was for so long such a talking point.
So that finally, when you do see it, you think,
"Is that it?"
That was my first reaction, I thought it's, like, so cheesy and really banal, too...
I thought it wasn't even very well told.
And so my first reaction was:
Why was this film censored for years?
And what's so terrible about it?
I'd imagined it much worse.
Because there'd been so much talk about it, and, because it was censored for so long.
So I had thought it was really extremist.
And it was only in the context of propaganda that I saw what effects it had.
It was good to see it in a school context.
So as not to be abandoned with it, but that an explanation is furnished of how... and with which means...
And I have to say, none of my fellow pupils said to me,
"My God!
Your grandfather made this!"
ln November 1 939,
Veit Harlan was commissioned to make jew Süss.
Goebbels, Minister for Rropaganda, summoned the best German actors.
The film is pseudo-historical, relates to thejew joseph Süss Oppenheimer, a financial adviser in early 1 8th Century Württemberg.
The film opened in German cinemas in September 1 940.
The female lead was played by Harlan's wife, Kristina Söderbaum.
Her popularity meant that jew Süss could be sold to the public as both drama and entertainment.
Whilst filming crowd scenes in Rrague, Harlan used jewish extras from Rrague and Lublin's ghettos.
This scene had the effect of prompting the audience to shout out things like "Kick thejews outl"
Hundreds ofjews come here.
The people are outraged.
They fall on us like locusts.
Mr. Oppenheimer sets taxes...
That Oppenheimer managed to introducejews into Stuttgart was what the audience found threatening, and generally unacceptable.
Some 20 million Germans saw it, as did another 20 million Europeans.
Heinrich Himmler officially requested, one week after the German premiere, that measures be taken to ensure that all SS and policemen be shown this film.
The dimensions are unimaginable.
What did such films lead to, what was their direct effect?
To what extent did they influence any given SS man?
One can't say.
If the question is, who in Germany was guilty, many things need to be considered.
The fact is many millions were slain by us.
Back then I got a postcard from Lublin.
I still have it somewhere.
On it he wrote, "You can't imagine, how glad thejews are to work with me."
An enthusiastic postcard.
From Lublin.
I remember it well.
I remember that
I wasn't surprised at the time.
It wasn't till later that I reconsidered it, asked myself, what on earth was that card?
Did he believe that these people, so soon to be killed, should be allowed to celebrate their religion in peace one last time?
It's monstrous!
Or is this just more projection?
What did they know of their end?
What did my father know of it?
I don't know.
The hardest problem for our civil administration in occupied territory is thejewish question.
German soldiers have been shot at in this ghetto.
Reprisals have been swift in coming.
This eastern jewish sub-humanity is the source of the international criminals that plague the West.
It has supplied Western democracies with pickpockets, procurers, dealers of girls and narcotics, and manipulators of international finance and the press.
These are the samejews whose brothers, sons and cousins in London and Raris make such fine speeches about humanity and civilization.
lnsubordinate elements are being contained in camps.
It's plain to me that such a film at such a time, and in the context of the propaganda that this film typifies...
That given this context the film was the cause of massive and malign results.
I'm sure of it.
Film has always been subverted into propaganda.
These days all the war games and films are sponsored by the American military.
They finance and produce war games so as to requisition people.
Little has changed.
He was certainly not anti-Semitic.
And certainly not a Nazi.
Not at all.
He spoke so derogatively about Nazis.
He can't have been one.
He had loads ofjewish friends.
They loved him.
Our doctor was jewish, we had jews all around us.
I believe that he really had a huge problem with jewish culture and with thejewish religion.
It's true he'd had a jewish wife, but she later left him and married a jew.
This hurt his ego.
Furthermore, he draws on all of the anti-jewish imagery and depictions throughout the centuries.
Thus all his resentment and rejection of this culture finds expression this way.
No, I don't believe that his first wife,
Dora Gershon, nor his anti-Semitism are relevant themes.
That's too superficial.
The truth is the non-anti-Semite was the best man to sharpen the knives.
What makes this particularly dreadful is that the person who did this didn't comprehend what he'd been complicit in.
And by the time he might be expected to have understood it, he still hadn't realized that he should no longer practice this profession.
You never discussed jew Süss with him?
Directly, no.
I saw the film.
But directly, no.
- You never discussed jew Süss?
- Never.
No.
I had no chance till he was on his death bed.
He didn't let me ask.
He spoke to me, not with me.
These are very different things.
I couldn't talk to him about it.
He told me about his worries about having made this film.
But I couldn't say to him,
I saw the film and didn't like this or that aspect.
I hadn't seen the film.
Even if you're apolitical, to make such a film which...
And I do accept that he didn't want to make it.
But why did he have to make it so well?
Why make such a good film?
I can't comprehend it.
This is the reproach that...
to my mind, won't go away.
Someone who is so...
possessed by his work can't intentionally make a crap film.
It's impossible.
He has to make it as well as he is able.
And he presumably thought his way of going about it was more humane and less venomous than that of Goebbels or... the rest of them... who had been supposed to make the film.
Even if it were to cost him his life, he would never deliver a bad piece of work.
Some musicians simply can't play badly.
Yes, but a good director will know how to direct badly.
He thought only of the moment, the good scenes, the good light, getting a fine shot, and of a satisfied Goebbels.
I don't think he really imagined what it would lead to.
He didn't tell me at once, he...
He came home, pale in the face, said, "I'll tell you about it later."
And then he told me that night, after lights-out.
He said, "Yes...
I have to make the film."
And I sat up straight and said, "You simply cannot do this!"
There must have been coercion for him to have made jew Süss.
But how this situation is to be judged...
I only know the story in his version.
And it, of course, has a subjective facet.
That it was a question of a situation which he himself did not welcome...
I absolutely accept his word on this.
I believed him then and I believe it now.
He wanted to carry on making films.
That was paramount.
And the extent to which this was problematic for him is, to my mind,
ridiculously exaggerated in his memoirs.
There he claims to have been forced.
This is the most absurd thing he says.
It wasn't fear that drove him.
He was working with material that meant something to him, and he molded it to perfection because of this.
And the other thing was, he'd seen that if he was to fulfill this commission,
he'd have no trouble with the financing of future projects.
Scruples?
No, he certainly had... none.
I'll put it this way:
His claims that he was forced to make the film are to be believed.
There are plenty of reasons to do so, witnesses, too who corroborate this.
So the question is, if it is only due to coercion that I do something I find reprehensible,
why then would I coerce my wife?
Why put her in a position where she will do something immoral that I want to avoid?
She's a free woman.
Goebbels can't give her orders.
I would say that the fact that she acts in the film is virtually proof that he didn't really worry about it all.
Because he'd never have imposed something awful on her.
Or something bad.
He found it possible and right to make the film.
That's why she's in it.
The explanation's simple.
And it terrifies me.
The explanation is awful.
Well, Actuarius, you can't be having fun.
You know that voice.
Oh my God!
Take the cloth down.
Take it down.
What does this mean?
Do you still hear anything?
That's the meaning.
So take it down, child.
Oh, you give it back!
No!
No?
Fine.
Keep it then.
But...
- Oh Lord abovel
- What?
Oh,you're praying?
Rray to your God.
Rrayl
Not only Christians have a God.
Wejews do, too.
He is the God of vengeance.
Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.
- You can thank your father.
- Let me go.
Should I save the traitors from being shot?
- Don't you touch me.
- Don't be so prim and you'll get your Actuarius back again.
As I was saying, you take guilt upon yourself by making such a film, and doing it well.
And this relates to my father.
But my mother, who as a young girl had come across such a despotic man.
And gone through thick and thin with him and done everything that he told her to.
Whilst being incredibly naive.
I mean, my mother's strengths didn't include her intellect or her analytical abilities.
That wasn't really her thing.
She was a person who made a strong impression on others and who could be incredibly sweet and touching and nice.
But she had no idea what she had done there.
So it's just silly to reproach her.
It was a known fact that anti-Semitism was present in Germany.
And it was after 1 938 and I began experiencing those terrible things.
I wasn't in Berlin on Kristallnacht, but it was 1 938, and even if you'd seen nothing, you still knew that people were being persecuted.
Neither she nor Veit Harlan were stupid.
They knew what it meant.
But I think it's easier to say, in retrospect, that she was to an extent complicit than this was in fact plain to her then.
Maybe not in jew Süss but in the films before it, like you said, too.
Because at the start, coming to Germany...
Filming anything at all...
And, then, filming with a great director, and with other great actors was something for her...
And she was young at the time...
It wasn't apparent to her where this was leading.
What situation she was in and where it might end.
She didn't think about it.
She was a very important and popular actress so she had a certain responsibility and therefore, also, a certain guilt.
You could say that she was, to an extent, naive, but it's also related to the Swedish mentality.
Back then, mail bags would be hung up on the trees, and there'd be money inside and so on, but no one stole anything.
The world was intact there.
And it's naive to think that when you come to Berlin it'll be like that too.
You see.
Kristina Söderbaum had come to Germany as a young actress in 1 935.
Her role models were Elisabeth Bergner and Marlene Dietrich.
Having starred in two of Harlan's films, she became his wife in 1 939.
The same year their son Kristian Veit was born.
Söderbaum acted exclusively in her husband's films including The Immortal Heart, the story of the neglected wife of the pocket watch's brilliant inventor.
The city of Nuremberg is renowned for people like Albrecht Dürer,
Hans Sachs and Peter Henlein.
Your Behaim is a madman like you.
But you shall have memorials after your death.
On our house will be a plaque reading:
"Here lived and died Peter Henlein."
And no one will ever know that he was the death of his wife.
Don't you touch me!
You are immune to it all.
The eternal fame you so crave will be yours.
But me?
What do I have?
just pain and suffering and sacrifice.
The conceit of men makes them believe their wives are property there to live and die for them.
You too believe that in your treacherous heart.
But let me tell you this in the name of all womankind:
I retort to your arrogance with these hands of mine.
- Not the watch!
- I'll be rid of it!
My mother was obliged, when he was directing her, to do lots of things that she didn't want to do.
Like ride a horse into a cage containing six Siberian tigers.
Or, before that,
I think it was in The Great Sacrifice, they waited till the North Sea was wild in November, and she had to ride into it.
He insisted on it.
I must admit, these pictures were great.
But he gave personal feelings scant regard in his professional life.
Aels!
Don't go in so deep.
It suddenly gets deep.
Aels!
Do you imagine my horse can't swim?
I guess he loved her.
But it was... the kind of love where you take complete possession of someone...
It's not for everyone.
I couldn't stand being loved in that way, and being forced into subordination.
I couldn't stand it.
Kristina Söderbaum, the archetypal naive, childlike woman, became a screen idol with her natural, blonde, Aryan looks.
She was one of the best paid female stars ofher time.
Nobody else embodied purity, unspoiled nature and idyllic romance as she did.
Harlan used this charisma to enhance the dramatic, fateful films he liked to make.
Kristina Söderbaum became noted for her on-screen deaths.
It's happened to me twice, that elderly people have said,
"Ah yes, your grandmother was called..."
Then they hesitate, say, "No, I won't say it."
And I say, "The water corpse, I know."
Annchen!
When she did die,
Lotte and I were both there.
We went back the next morning and the undertakers had her in her bier her hands folded.
I saw her and thought,
"She isn't dead, she'll get up as soon as someone says 'cut."'
Harlan's sentimental and gloomy dramas are based on works by writers such as Theodor Storm and Rudolf Binding.
The director is masterful in working with bombastic contexts.
He said himself,
"lf my films found favor, it was due to innocence and its loss,
Eros and nature, cruelty, murder and suicide. "
I don't quite know what the source was of the kitschy melodramas such as The Great Sacrifice and lmmensee.
I don't know if all this kitsch came from the wife, or if these things were part of him.
I fear they were in him.
Those angelic choirs!
He had a weakness for things heavenly.
It was the postulation of feelings that didn't really exist.
The synthetic creation of sentiment.
I fear that The Great Sacrifice and lmmensee are prime examples of this:
Creating artificial sentiment and lending it... credibility.
Thank you, Elisabeth.
- Farewell, Elisabeth.
- Reinhardt, I'll see you in two years.
Faithfulness was a popular theme.
Both in political and in emotional terms.
It was wartime, the men were away.
So faithfulness was extremely important.
We spoke about my parents' private lives, to both of them this was extremely important.
And that faithfulness in this film...
My father could usually decide what kind of film he wanted to make.
Normally.
With the propaganda films less so.
But normally he could choose his themes.
And of course these were themes that meant something to him and to her, and were generally popular in any case.
This is the cinema of illusion and of playing with emotions.
And I'd say that that was what was essential to him.
And that this neatly coincided with the implications that Goebbels required and with the fundaments of the Third Reich.
Harlan was solidly conservative.
A German nationalist, etc.
These are the values that he represented and which the Nazis also subscribed to.
In this regard, they fitted together well.
This is a special I D card issued by the Ministry for Propaganda which allowed Veit Harlan to use at anytime the backdoor to the Ministry for Propaganda on Wilhelm Platz in Berlin.
I think this was really an elite group who would be received at all times by Goebbels, or who could wait for an audience with him.
And only the most important filmmakers would receive such a thing.
ln 1 94 2, Veit Harlan presented at the Venice Film Festival his first color feature film, The Golden City.
He was, by then, Germany's leading filmmaker, the prodigy the country could boast of.
His films are shown in most of Europe to great success.
The Agfa colors that characterize The Golden City are mixed with racist undercurrents contrasting the Czechs with the Germans, pure country life with life in sinful Rrague.
The odious thing is this belief in fate.
The mother of a young woman died on the moors, so the daughter has no choice but to follow in her mother's footsteps and to kill herself.
The inevitable and inescapable is being depicted here.
And this is, of course, deeply reactionary.
Mother dear.
Mother dear.
Father wouldn't take me in.
I'm coming to you.
Mother dear.
You see.
I'm going in the same way... as you.
Mother.
I hear you.
You're calling me.
Mother.
During such times when so many people were dying and the meaning of life is questioned, it was important, I think, that death becomes something significant, that there's an aftereffect, that people mourn.
That your death has had a purpose.
That's what these films express.
If you saw a melodrama at that time, and had lost one of your relatives or even one of your immediate family, these films were soothing, gave you the impression
that death is not just death but contains a significance.
These melodramas gave it importance.
Harlan had difficulty with filigree work, the gentle touch.
In lmmensee there's some of it.
He was quite crude in his use of effects, and often overreached himself by setting such laden accents.
This even makes him interesting at times:
Few people dared do this.
In The Great Sacrifice it's almost surreal.
Albrecht!
I'm not at the gate, Aels.
It's Octavia who's greeting you.
Is that really you?
It is!
It is you!
I can see you, Albrecht.
Is that really you?
Who can say what's real?
Why did you come here, Albrecht?
To say farewell, Aels!
Yes, we must.
Harlan's last film in the Third Reich is the historical film Kolberg.
It depicts a Romeranian town resisting Napoleon's troops in 1 807.
This epic portrayal of steadfastness was the most expensive and laborious of all Nazi films.
Having made The Great King,
Harlan is destined to make this film.
ln spite of the war and the difficulty of getting materials,
The Rropaganda Minister gives the director almost unlimited resources.
We have to destroy the French supply lines.
There's no danger from the sea.
We'll attack their flanks!
It was all soldiers and battles.
I was very impressed that all the military, that you'd imagine was required at the front was there for the film.
This was a huge-scale thing with 1 0,000 people in the town of Kolberg.
Whilst millions were dying on the battlefields, the film calls on the civil population to never surrender, to die as martyrs and share in this downfall.
"Better buried beneath rubble than ever surrender"
is the watchword much in keeping with Goebbels' "total war. "
Kolberg is shown in those few cinemas still standing in january 1 945.
It is the last great film premiere in the Third Reich.
Prussians!
Germans!
Our city must encounter a cruel fate, as must our fatherland.
But courage is stronger than fate.
Had you not resisted foreign forces, I'd not be here now.
That's what unites us.
No love is more sacred than the love of the fatherland.
No joy is sweeter than that of freedom.
But what awaits us in defeat, is beknown to you all.
Whatever sacrifice is demanded of you is as nothing compared to the sacred values for which we fight so as to remain Germans and Prussians.
Gneisenau!
Gneisenau!
I've never knelt before a man.
But I do so now.
Kolberg may not be abandoned.
Gneisenau!
That's the spirit, Nettelbeck.
Now we can die together.
Goebbels had a choleric fit when he first saw the film.
He cried that it was a pacifist film.
And remarked incisively that pacifists are always ruled by non-pacifists.
He demanded that all the horrors be cut.
So I had to cut the scenes where doors were torn down to make coffins since there was no other wood, where the corpses had poisoned the water, where a grenade exploded in a house where a woman had just given birth and the child was buried alive.
He called this sadism.
I said, "Minister, I can't portray heroics if I don't show how heroic people are and how terrible their circumstances."
But he was of a different opinion, and much was cut from the film.
Indeed two million marks worth of horrors were cut from the film.
And this, of course, altered the film considerably.
Because I'd been intent on depicting the horror itself.
In May, 1 945,
Harlan wrote a 23-page statement about his stance on National Socialism.
The trigger was that international and German papers accused him of being the number one Nazi director, so he wrote a long statement, claiming that his life had been under threat throughout this time, as had been the life of his wife,
and that in fact, in legal parlance, he'd been under an "obligation to obey orders."
And this remained the basic defense during the trials of Veit Harlan.
After the end of the war, the denazification commission found that Harlan had been merely a fellow traveler, but initially banned him from working.
He nonetheless directed several plays under a pseudonym.
ln 1 948, Harlan is prosecuted in Hamburg because ofjew Süss and he is publicly attacked.
I remember that several times they both wanted to go to the theater, and, in Hamburg, it was Ida Ehre, who got up on stage and said in front of everyone she wanted Veit Harlan and Kristina Söderbaum to leave the theater.
And they both did... rather sadly.
I'd known from earliest infancy that my parents had serious problems.
It was obvious, a feature of my earliest conscious experience, that my parents were under attack,
that they defended themselves vigorously, and that this made no difference at all.
I think, however, that the directors of that period all had a good eye on their careers.
Some more than others.
And my grandfather was someone, I think who thought of nothing but his career...
In his choice of, say, whether to make a given film or not.
And the fact that he never accepted responsibility, never recanted any of it...
He was never self-critical, never said outright, "I wanted to make films, that's all."
So attention was concentrated on him.
Self-justification is rejection of guilt and responsibility.
Instead of saying, "Okay, I made a mistake.
I had certain priorities, the leading one being:
Continue to make films whatever it may cost."
I imagine that he would have been a little less harshly judged by certain segments of the public.
I struggled with myself.
I saw how people recounted the sufferings they'd experienced, and how their whole family had died in Auschwitz or elsewhere,
I'd feel sick.
Then I'd see how my father was beside himself with all the false accusations, and how he defended himself.
I was beside myself.
I had a friend who studied medicine.
And he demonstrated on the street against Veit.
Kristina had eggs thrown at her, that kind of thing.
And I was already in a position where I understood why this happened and also understood my friend a little.
But nonetheless, I was furious.
Both emotions at once.
I certainly wouldn't say that he was wrongly persecuted.
I just think that both he and others should have been convicted.
And this didn't happen in his or in other cases.
He didn't feel as guilty as others claimed he was.
He always maintained that he'd been forced and that he'd been under such pressure that he couldn't refuse, that he'd had to do as he had.
There he sits, that accursed jew.
In a trial lasting months, he has told nothing but lies, lies and more lies.
His only excuse is that the duke gave him carte blanche.
The charges I face are due to the direct orders I received from my duke.
I have the duke's written orders.
You can check.
I am merely the faithful servant of my master.
- Boo!
- Yes, boo...
The judge, Dr. Tyrolf, who found him innocent on two occasions
had, during the war had Ukrainian women beheaded for the theft of a head scarf
during an air raid.
And... the thought that my father had been found innocent amongst and by such people was abhorrent to me.
That was it!
I thought, "This is a world I want no further dealings with.
I must entirely distance myself from it."
That's it.
Perhaps I didn't put it that way, but I'll never forget that moment.
Having been found innocent,
Harlan could again direct films.
ln the Germany of the '50s, he polarized public opinion much like director Leni Riefenstahl.
His film premieres and appearances met with protests and boycotts.
ln public meetings, he went on the offensive against his opponents.
He always stressed that as an artist he'd been used by the Nazis and by the "demonic Goebbels. "
Veit Harlan attempted in his post-war films to return to his old successes.
Kristina Söderbaum was still one of Germany's most popular actresses.
ln order to find any work at all, Harlan had to take less attractive jobs and get by without the huge budgets that Goebbels had given him.
The melodramas he made after the war might just as well have been made in the '30s.
They were of that era.
He simply wasn't capable of adapting to new times or new ideas, to a more open form, or to progress and change.
These films are very hermetic and... his whole oeuvre reflects a very specific world view.
And this is just as consistently represented as it is in the case of some great filmmakers who have a conception of the world that is represented throughout their works.
This can really be said of Harlan.
You do dare to judge others?
Then let me tell you how I judge you!
Your love of your brother is sickening.
Impure!
Criminal!
Your love is incestuous.
My love is what?
The whole village says so!
What does the village say?
Even your friend, the veterinarian, called you an Isis.
Isis?
You know what that means, don't you?
Lord in heaven!
She's the devil!
Try to be reasonable.
Don't you touch me.
The atmosphere in the '50s helped Harlan maintain his view ofhimself as a victim of the Nazi era.
He tried to give his family a life of prosperity and normality,
Their lives revolve around a villa in Bavaria.
Friends from the revived film industry would meet there.
But, as Harlan noted in a draft ofhis autobiography, the shadow ofjew Süss won't disappear.
What the film did to us?
I can tell you precisely:
It ruined our lives.
That's what it did.
Like that.
And at that point, you simply couldn't have guessed this.
That it would be used in such a way.
That it could simply wreck... a person's life.
The whole fate of my parents, so to speak had, of course, a great influence on my life.
And that already began, when, as an adolescent, in my late adolescence, friends of my parents recommended to me that I change my name.
For me this was out of the question.
I said, "No, why should I?
I don't have to change my name."
I once had a history teacher who wasn't pleasant by nature, was rather difficult.
She asked me in front of the whole class if I was related to Veit Harlan my name being the same.
And I said no.
But I was in tears.
I cried and left the class room.
I said, "No, he's not my grandfather."
But it caused me hardship because then I got called a damn Hun.
That wasn't funny.
And anyway, at college you feel guilty of things regardless of what they are...
And I'd always refused to find out what had happened or to ask my father, Thomas.
To me, my grandparents were Nazis.
And that's it.
I wouldn't listen to explanations.
But I really felt it.
And I was very ashamed.
It never happened to me, that someone asked,
"Is your name not that of Veit Harlan, the German director?"
That never happened.
I did voluntarily tell this story to good friends of mine.
But it's not the kind of thing... that you talk about at the bar...
My sister, Maria...
Why did she, as an actress, call herself Maria Körber?
And not Maria Harlan anymore?
What did it mean?
She wanted to change her history, to vanish.
And my sister Susanne.
Susanne Harlan.
Why did she take the stage name "Susanne Körber?"
Why, when she married, was she "née Körber"
before taking the name ofjacoby?
Why did they all try to eradicate my father from their identities?
Although they all felt a kinship that was profound.
He knows perfectly I didn't choose to abandon the name.
I bewailed it myself, my father was unhappy about it too.
My agents said to me,
"We can't place you with the name Harlan.
Change your name."
I said I loved my father and wouldn't.
They kept on and on at me.
Then one day I got a contract.
And on it was the name "Maria Körber."
They did it behind my back.
I couldn't change it.
My father cried.
And I was very unhappy.
I didn't use force to keep the name.
But somehow, I never managed to break with it by no longer using the name.
I met a colleague.
He was jewish and his father had been killed by the Nazis.
Right at the end.
And I married him though everyone said,
"You can't!
He's so unsuitable!
He's a bad guy."
And I said, "You don't understand.
He has suffered.
Now he needs help.
And, having heard what I have about my father,
I have the feeling that I must help someone who lost his father like that, and who was abused at school, called a half-jew, expelled from school."
And since he'd had such a time of it, such a terrible time, I married him.
I thought I was doing a good deed.
But what a mess it turned out to be!
It really worked out wrong.
Nothing changed.
I couldn't change anything.
And my... feelings of having to compensate someone for the deeds that my father, too, had participated in...
I didn't succeed at all.
The same thing happened to my sister.
She married Claude, or Klaus, jacoby, who was also a jew.
She married him and went over tojudaism.
My father was 1 7 years older than my mother.
My mother converted tojudaism so as to get closer to him.
And to replace for him all that he had lost.
But it was impossible.
My mother wanted nothing but to leave, leave, leave.
To leave behind her history, her father, and everything that this had meant to her.
So that she felt invisible as a person.
My father died young of a heart attack in 1 964, two weeks after the death of my grandfather.
My mother had a veterinary surgery practice that did worse and worse business.
She found it shameful, being unable to support herself, would never have taken state benefits, and, well... if a person has no sense of self-worth, and no more will to live...
And it was at that point that she killed herself.
I belong to a family... which the Nazi era divided entirely into perpetrators and victims.
I knew, particularly, that my grandfather had had a career making films for the Nazis, at a time, when the Nazis had murdered my other grandparents.
I knew this at the age of five or six.
My grandfather, Arturjacoby, fought in the First World War and thought himself German.
He was proud of the Iron Cross (First Class) he'd won.
He struggled desperately to be allowed to emigrate with my grandmother.
He wasn't allowed to, was deported to Minsk, and... was murdered there.
Whilst during that period, my grandfather, Veit Harlan, successfully made the feature films of the Third Reich,
lived a life of luxury, and profited from the system to the greatest extent possible, he, too, a war volunteer during the first world war.
One of my grandfathers was in the limelight, was controversial and prominent, the other vanished into the darkness.
So the one made propaganda for the other's destruction?
Yes.
You could say that, inasmuch as jew Süss is a call to persecute and kill thejews
in Germany and the rest of Europe.
And my other grandfather and grandmother paid for this with their lives.
Stanley's parents were from Kiev... and Romania.
His parents were ofjewish descent.
Everyone he knew was Italian orjewish.
Stanley was in Munich, we'd decided to marry, he wanted to take me to America.
And Veit said, "You're going to America?
Terrible!"
He didn't want me to go.
My parents were there, Veit and Kristina were there, and some others, too.
I said to Stanley, "You'll meet them now."
I'd confessed already about my awful ancestry.
And... he drank a big glass of vodka, and he met them.
My husband was shaken after meeting all these polite and amusing people.
And he said-
And he was... astonished.
For a long time, he thought about... how to make a film about this.
But he didn't succeed.
Stanley Kubrick wanted to make a film about this era.
The normal course of daily events when producing a film in Berlin.
What was it like?
A production meeting at 8:00, budget, costumes... the whole thing, casting...
He wanted to know, wanted to make a film about how this all took place.
What was it like?
At what point did Goebbels intervene?
When was the okay required for each scene of the script?
What were those discussions like?
What influence was applied?
What conversations were held?
Revealing things like that.
I remember being in Maximilian Schell's apartment with him and Kristina Söderbaum, and we worked on her to try to get details that you can work into such a story.
But we got nothing worthwhile.
The interesting thing was that Veit Harlan got his son to write a film script with him in the mid-'50s, in spite of all the son's activities after the war,
and that the father was then criticized because the film was allegedly pro-Communist.
Because it was one of the few '50s films that touched on the crimes of the Wehrmacht, at least briefly.
And in which the Communists and Russians aren't simply maligned.
Hence the film's strange rating.
Thomas Harlan was the child who developed the most strength, energy and activity of all the children.
And it was always from a position that was diametrically opposed to his father's.
After the war, Thomas Harlan lived many years in France,
Roland and the Soviet Union.
He researched the Warsaw Ghetto, found remains of concentration camps, discovered evidence to prosecute war criminals.
ln the '7 0s, he was involved in the socialist revolutions in Chile and Rortugal, realized spectacular avant-garde films like Wundkanal, and wrote many novels on German and Russian history.
You can't just say, "You should have known."
He should have known that it was wrong.
Simply.
And forbidden himself to enjoy doing it.
It's terrible, feeling that he enjoyed doing it.
But nonetheless, assuming that it had been that way, after the war, having found out, that it had been an instrument of murder.
Imagine!
You've created an instrument of murder.
Then you'd have to change your life entirely.
And I didn't understand how his mind hadn't been completely changed.
After the war, my father worked as a carpenter, and I'd have understood if he'd never gone back to filmmaking.
- But he made films.
- He made films again.
I didn't understand how, as a son, he could speak like that about his father.
As if he were a film critic, you know?
Like a judge or something of the sort.
Somehow the fact has been completely forgotten that your father is your father.
And it's to him and your mother that you owe your life.
That's where it all begins.
You can talk about it amongst the family...
But really!
And profiting by so doing, too!
Honestly!
That's really shameful!
I really have no understanding for it.
That for thirty-odd years, somebody could keep on attacking our poor father.
It's too much.
I understand his opinions.
I understand them well, his hatred of the Nazis.
That's a different matter.
But what he said about him.
Our father wept bitterly about it.
But to react in this way as a son!
That others did so, and that the press took advantage, and that the story was popular,
that bit I do get.
But I want no part of it.
And what I think about my father is no one's business.
I'm not a politician or anything.
So, criticism should be internal, within the family, and not public.
Yes.
Of course.
You talk it over.
Was that the case between your father and you?
Between my father and me?
It was not on the agenda for my father and me.
I think that throughout the family, the value ofThomas's work has not been appreciated the way it deserves to be.
His life was destroyed by his attempts
to try to repair some of the things that his father had destroyed, and by trying to find the people whom he thought deserved punishment.
In his opinion, he never fully succeeded.
But that's impossible, anyway.
I think he's been traumatized and that he can't get over it.
He might have written 50 books, made 50 films.
It'll follow him to his grave.
It's a real injury that will never heal.
After all, he's 7 9 now and he still suffers from it all terribly.
I think it's hard.
I've encountered him in various situations.
Not only on the trail of former SS men and the history of Nazi Germany.
But the historical context is so scandalous that I appreciate the manner my father reacted to it.
I wasn't the son of a father I rejected.
I was the son of my father to such an extent
that with him
I was prepared to take responsibility for all the scandalous things
that he contributed to.
To take this responsibility.
It was self-evident to me to share his responsibility.
Rather than be against him.
I don't know how he, within himself, processed this.
I think he thought me an enemy.
Suffering from chronic cardiac disease, Veit Harlan retreated to Capri in 1 963.
The island on the Gulf of Naples was his favorite holiday resort.
It was the scene of many post-war films and a dream destination for Germans.
He laboriously completed his memoirs, his last attempt to justify himself.
I found it so meaningful that on his death bed, he called for the son who had damned him.
I understood it as a really huge step.
If I'd thought he'd live another year or so, that he'd recover or die an easier death, there'd have been plenty of conversation.
I wouldn't want to publicly say my father had come to understand it all.
But he did think things over.
He spoke with Thomas, with whom he had such confrontations, more than he did with me.
When I came to Capri, and he was in the hospital, he was already...
He was dying.
It lasted a long time... because he wanted to live until his 25th wedding anniversary.
Which he succeeded in.
The doctors said, "He is actually dead already."
But he stayed alive long enough to see his wedding anniversary.
He died three days later.
The marriage to my mother was- and this was mutual-
the fixed component in life.
For both of them.
But I remember him as someone who avoided responsibility.
And I'd feel relieved if I knew that he died having accepted this responsibility.
That he died knowing what he had to answer for.
Simply.
I'd feel calmer.
There'd be less unease within me if he'd left behind what had been his life in better order.
So.
I'm a bit tired now.
Would you like to-
No, I'll lie down.
I've lived here and been an activist for 30 years.
And we knew from the beginning that we had to resist
what was being done here.
You have to learn from what has happened.
I think I have a very deep need to be an active part of this resistance.
And this may well be related to what happened in my family.
I consider this to be the lead-up to a great disaster, the production of atomic waste.
I'm convinced that this is a crime against humanity perpetrated for economic gain.
And the lesson I have learned from German history is that resistance must be prompt.
We're trying to do this, employing all the means we have.
Now I have projects I'm involved with, my music and my son...
Of course a child is always a bridge reaching into the future.
And indeed I'm much more concerned with all of this, and with my work, than with Veit Harlan or the Harlan family.
Having said this, I'm ready to give the matter consideration.
Intellectual consideration.
It is more intellectual than emotional to me.
But there is something in the psyche of our family, something that could be called a sense of guilt.
Everyone tells me it's not my fault, it was my grandfather.
They don't try to understand that it's still my blood.
So perhaps I have some bad blood too.
When you're young, you don't understand.
I'm sick of this burden upon me.
I want to understand, to know about it.
Because even though I wasn't brought up by my father
I think there's a genetic link.
When I have children, I want to tell them about it.
All of the story.
Not just not know about it.
So I want to find out, know all about my grandparents,
and about Thomas's life, so I can tell my children.
That's my goal.
It shouldn't be forgotten.
It's like when myjewish patients tell me stories so they don't die out.
The last few of that generation from the Nazi era are vanishing now.
And who'll tell the story then?
It'd be dreadful if it were forgotten.
No, I think the inheritance of guilt involves having... an obligation to deal with it.
You don't have to project guilt onto yourself, but have to deal with it.
And we're ready to do so.
We're concerned by it.
We don't just reject it out of hand.
Of course it'd be great if Grandpa had been a resistance fighter.
But that wouldn't have meant that I'd been courageous or shown my strength, either.
If I'd had a grandfather who'd sacrificed his life for something it wouldn't reflect on me.
And so, by that token,
I don't bear the guilt, either.
It exists, must be dealt with...
But it wasn't me who did it.
It's almost something positive, like a reminder to bear all this in mind.
It has nothing to do with the question of guilt.
And I don't believe it would make sense to feel guilty in the third generation.
But it is still important to give it consideration.
You still have the sense of how close it all is.
I don't have to turn Grandfather into a problem for her.
I just have to be there if it becomes one.
I wouldn't want children who'd say,
"It's not my name, leave me out of it."
It is an infamous story, and I can't imagine that my children's children's children... can really be relieved of all responsibility for it.
Be it only in terms of:
Are you aware of what happened?
Sometimes that's enough.
- Previsously...
- You're my little brother.
- To trust me, take this back.
- Going back to Omega Chi.
So Evan wins.
We said we weren't gonna let our houses get in the way of us being friends.
- You did nothing.
- It was a prank!
I used to see everything in terms of whether it would piss off my parents.
I just didn't want people to think I was dating you to get to her.
- You like Michael, right?
- I think so.
Gentlemen, it's time to get your fake Ids.
Chad Stewart.
I'm not interested in being anyone's warm body.
I'm gonna go tell Casey I'm an idiot and I want her back.
She wants us to be friends,
I said I was on board, but I don't think I am.
Did you pay Shane Mullen to stay away from me?
- How could you be so spiteful?
- I didn't do it to be.
- Why?
- Because I love you.
I think you should take some time.
- Get your head together.
- We're done.
Maybe instead of trying to keep all the guys away from one girl, find a girl who thinks you're the only guy.
Why do you want to be a lawyer?
It was easier to follow Evan's path.
I know what kind of law I want to practice: none.
Can you pick up my mail while you're...
You're packing?
It's spring break.
Why would I not be?
I assumed that you were gonna be sticking around campus.
I need a break.
I'm not a machine, contrary to what my academics imply.
So while you're submerged in surf, sand and sin with your fraternity brothers in South Carolina,
I am gonna be engaged in something far less reckless in Virginia.
You're...
- I have no idea.
- Wild turkey hunting with my family.
Killing turkeys is safer than going to the beach?
Are you familiar with the dangers of spring break?
Drunken injury?
Pregnancy?
Parasailing gone awry?
What about the people injured or killed while hunting?
They're just morons.
This is spring break.
This is the most sacred of college traditions.
Why waste that on your parents?
Do something with your friends, like take a road trip to warmer weather.
As if it ever gets that cold here.
Have fun killing turkeys.
Have fun perpetuating stereotypes of wasted, reckless, youth.
Two minutes, girls.
And windows...
Check.
The house is officially ready for lockdown, which means in two minutes I am officially on spring break!
I can feel the weight of my presidential duties lifting from my shoulders.
Could you put it on my suitcase?
We're going to Myrtle Beach for a week, not a year-long expedition to Mars.
I have to bring everything Teresa bought me.
- Teresa Visa.
She's very generous.
- But your card is a Credit Plus.
I know, but nothing cute rhymes with Credit Plus.
- There!
- Think this will fit in your car?
Lucky for you, I packed light.
All I need is sunscreen, a sarong and an iPod filled with beach music.
I'm leaving the rest of my baggage behind:
literally and figuratively.
No Jimmy Buffet.
We have plenty of time to listen to him when we are old and sad.
No Buffet.
No ex-boyfriends.
No Zeta Beta business.
Most of all, no worrying about the gaping hole that is my future.
I plan to flirt with boys and check things off the spring break list.
Oh my god, where did you find this?
In my old beach towel.
Remember when we made these freshman year?
We were such wide-eyed spring break virgins.
There are still things on here.
I'd like to finish it.
- Like what?
- Playing a drinking game, entering a contest and skinny dipping.
Casey Cartwright gone wild!
It's time.
Let's go, let's go!
Spring break awaits!
Lift off!
Season 1
- Episode 22 (FINAL) " Spring Broke "
- Synchro :
Kasius ¤AkaZab¤
Hurry up!
You're wasting valuable party time!
Get in here!
Welcome aboard.
We know you have many choices in travel and we thank you for choosing KT Air.
I love this bus.
It has taken the Kts to Myrtle Beach for 32 spring breaks in a row.
It is a legend.
Pledge Cartwright will be serving chips and fries in the main cabin.
And this bus makes only five stops and five stops only for gas.
- What about...?
- Only for gas.
So cool.
Come on, come on.
Are we there yet?
Wait for me!
Final answer!
Excuse me.
Hi, we're checking in.
Welcome to the Yacht House Inn, where your vacation is shipshape.
- How may I help you?
- Reservation under ZBZ, CRU Chapter.
Two rooms for the week.
Enjoy.
I said: "Final answer!"
I think there's been a mistake.
We have five rooms reserved.
No you don't.
We'll take three more rooms, please.
And you can put it on the card.
We're sold out, suge.
I don't know if you've heard, but it's spring break.
Connie?
We'd like some ice in my room, please, and a few extra towels.
Rebecca, you're here.
- And so are you, finally.
- How did you beat us?
We took her father's jet and it was awesome!
And Daddy's travel staff booked us this huge suite.
You should come up to our floor later.
Wait up.
There's been a minor snafu with our reservation.
Would you and the pledges be willing to share your rooms with us sisters?
After all, nobody wanna sleep on the floor.
Actually we're going to use this week to bond as a pledge class.
Having sisters in the room would change the dynamic, so...
No problem, little sis.
Who plans on sleeping anyway?
Check out this dingy motel.
This is even dingier than I imagined.
- Was that a...?
- It was a car backfiring, probably.
Whoever wants to hit downtown, we're leaving ahora!
Isn't this place great?
Only $199 a night!
Has anyone seen my bag?
Coming through!
Watch the outfit!
That's a brand-new flip...
- ... flop.
- Sorry.
I've got these giant clown feet that aren't always under my control.
Giant feet.
How about let my flip flop make it up to yours.
- How did you... do that?
- It's my secret weapon.
Double-fisting tonight, huh?
Just single-fisting.
I mean, I'm single.
Just an FYI.
I hope to see you around.
You will.
Where have you been?
That beer run was more of a marathon.
I just met the man I'm going to molest.
He is crazy gorgeous super generous.
He opened our beers with his shoe.
What's up?
So who is he?
Where's he from?
No clue!
That is the great thing about spring break!
All new boys to play with.
Please tell me it's not the guy in the doo-rag.
I know how you love men with accessories.
Where the hell is he?
I'm sure he's around here somewhere.
He's like Bigfoot.
He's the Hot Ness Monster.
This is a party!
It's great, huh?
It's like an Omega Chi party, only with less clothes.
And that, my friend, that is the beauty of spring break.
Some pretty chilly body language.
I think I'm ready for a new conversation.
- Happy spring break, Evs.
- Right back at ya, Frannie.
Keep moving.
Nothing to see here.
- Wishing you'd taken the jet?
- Miss Beaver moon a state trooper?
Never.
Our spring break pilgrimage is a sacred tradition.
If you want a ride home, the skies are very friendly.
Miss Logan, you're putting my tray table in its upright position.
- Let's go for a walk on the beach.
- But I was gonna meet the boys out.
We're gonna go to a bar with all-you-can-drink beer for $5.
- You spent all day with 'em on the bus.
- It's happy hour.
- You should come with us.
- Look around.
We've got you, me, the moon, sand, surf.
Pretty romantic, huh?
Spring break's for being rowdy, not romantic.
Our romance is often rowdy.
I guess I can take a little stroll.
Great!
I'll grab my jacket.
I'll grab a beer.
- If it isn't President Cartwright.
- Actually, it isn't.
Tonight I'm just Spring Break Cartwright.
With patented dual beer grip.
- A gift.
- Thank you.
I love gifts.
Enjoy.
I've got to get going.
We're playing Thumper.
A drinking game?
With your gag reflex?
It's on my spring break list.
Blast from the past.
- You gonna pierce your belly button?
- Once was enough, thank you.
I'm just tackling some unfinished business.
Like Thumper.
- You in?
- You might wanna find an easier target.
- Is anyone easier than you?
- How I would love to prove you wrong, but I promised a walk on the beach.
Very romantic.
- Am I interrupting something?
- Not at all.
Enjoy your walk.
Maybe we can spend two hours.
- Think of how far we've come.
- I just want to dance it out.
- I need to see Ids.
- What?
I'm a really good dancer.
Get ready.
Chad Stewart?
The musician?
Isn't that you?
We can say that guy stole your ID.
We'll totally back you up.
What are the odds?
I can't go in now.
We'll just go somewhere else.
It's OK.
I'm gonna go back to the motel.
I'll rest up for tomorrow night,
I'm gonna go bananas!
Ids, please.
Look at that line.
There's no way we're waiting in this line.
So we are looking for someone to buy drinks for.
Blueberry barnacle with a vita-boost, please.
Thank you.
I don't know what I was thinking.
That was at least 50 yards or something.
This shirt does not work.
- Sorry I missed you last night.
- Did you and the pledges get rowdy?
- You OK?
- Just a little asthma flair-up.
- If you need anything, let me know.
- Will do.
Healthy.
Cheers.
Are you in Myrtle?
Are you having fun?
Things are fine.
I'm just sitting on the beach.
Just relaxing from a full night of partying.
Are you using your inhaler?
You're so using your inhaler.
Liar.
I'm using my inhaler.
I meant about you having fun.
I just kind of expected this to be kinda the most amazing time of my life.
It's the New Year's Eve Syndrome.
It can't always live up to the hype.
I blame the media.
I've been up since 4am, when the rest of the pledges got home from that club that I couldn't get into because of stupid Chad Stewart.
- Who's Chad Stewart?
- I have no clothes.
I have no travel guide.
And, for some reason, my stupid asthma's back.
But the worst should be behind me, huh?
Are you wearing sun block?
Any spottings?
The Hot Ness Monster is an elusive beast.
What do you think, Mandi.
Over there?
Prime real estate.
That'll do, thank you.
Tropical Storm Rebecca.
I slept in the bathtub because of her, and now she's ruining our boy view.
Why can't she get over it?
Have you ever considered she might be threatened by you?
Why?
She's the senator's daughter with the invisible jet.
Because you're Zeta Beta president.
You're beautiful.
Go on.
You're the ex-girlfriend to a certain Cappie, with whom you looked pretty chummy last night.
In about five minutes, we start the sand castle contest.
Winners get free drinks at Club Paradox!
- Whatever.
- Cappie and I are finally friends.
Truly.
I'm over him.
Just like I'm over drama, remember?
Which means I'm not gonna let this beached whale get me depressed.
- Let's go build a sand castle!
- I don't want to get my bikini wet.
- Display purposes.
- Entering a contest is on my list.
You seem to not be enjoying the parade of possibility.
It's not really my kind of parade, you know?
We could go to the gay bar around here.
They have cages.
That was a lot of information.
When Casey and I came down here our sophomore year, she wanted to go...
She heard they had cages you could dance in.
So we went.
Thanks for the offer, but I'm not looking for a guy.
I miss the one I already have.
You remember when you're so excited about someone you want to spend every moment with them to make up for the time you're not together.
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's all right.
- You up for some volleyball?
- Absolutely.
What do you think?
It'll be fun.
- I don't know.
- Well, my friend thinks you're cute.
- You go.
Have fun.
- Are you sure?
Go on.
You're sure you have to go?
Honestly, I totally forgot that I have this project due or my polymeric materials class.
It's due on the Monday we get back.
Damn the competive world of polymer science.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
You can't win 'em all.
Travel safe, Spitter.
I got you a little gift for the road.
I'll see you next week.
No way.
- This is she.
- I'm calling from The Washington Post.
I don't need a subscription.
I'm in college.
I have no need for a newspaper.
Actually, this isn't about a subscription.
A matter we'd like to talk to you about if you have a couple moments.
Isn't this fun?
I haven't built a sand castle since I was 12.
Back when my biggest burden was having to play with Rusty.
I just wish there wasn't all this sand.
It lingers in places long after you leave the beach.
I think the Hot Ness Monster has breeched the surface.
Go get him!
I got it!
Sorry about that.
- Can I give you a hand?
- Actually, I could use a torso.
Lucky for you, I'm well-versed in torsos.
You sure you have time?
Rebecca's not planning another walk on the beach?
I've got all the time in the world.
As long as we're done by five.
She booked us a banana boat ride.
A banana boat?
You?
I'm man enough to ride a giant yellow phallus.
Besides, it's her first spring break.
I vaguely remember you riding one your freshman year.
It was the first thing I crossed off my list.
I guess it's the circle of life.
It's really good to see you so relaxed.
You're like your old self again.
But your mermaid is in dire need of a breast augmentation.
I'll be right back.
Wait up.
- Where are you headed?
- Back to my room.
- Thought I'd take a nap.
- Want some company?
Go, have fun.
Are you OK?
Why wouldn't I be?
Excuse me.
Folks, just got off with dispatch.
We should have another bus to take us back in about six hours.
Thanks very much.
- Where are you going?
- Gotta be a town up ahead.
I was gonna head over and find a car.
Can I go with you?
Suit yourself.
I think we need another round.
- I'll go get them.
- Let us contribute something.
What are you gonna contribute?
Thank you for your contribution.
You're welcome.
I'll get the drinks.
- What's up?
- This place is wild!
Look how packed it is.
I bet you've met a majority of the female population.
You wanna come hang out with us?
You go have fun.
I need to rent a car, please.
Just one-way to Cyprus, Ohio.
I need to see your driver's license and a major credit card.
When did you get your own credit card?
I'm sorry.
You gotta be at least 21 years of age to rent an automobile in the state of North Carolina.
I can die for my country but I can't rent a car?
I've heard that one before.
I'm sorry, the law's the law.
I'll get it.
And this is faker than my hair color.
There's no way on God's green earth that you're 24.
I am.
My name is Chad Stewart.
I live at 2343 Homer Terrace.
- What color are your eyes?
- What color?
That's what I thought.
- I'm gonna need to confiscate this.
- Take it.
It's cursed or something.
When did you get a fake ID?
- We shouldn't have left the bus.
- This isn't my fault.
I didn't invite you to join me.
I didn't want to let you walk off in the dark alone.
I feel so much safer now that you're here.
You're on your own.
I'm gonna get my own ride home.
Just how I wanted it.
Your target is about six-foot-two, brown hair, dreamy eyes.
And he's got a bottle opener in his flip-flop.
- Could you be a little more specific?
- Check your phones.
Yesterday, I got close but was thwarted by a rogue football game.
Luckily, I was close enough to snap a cell phone pic.
I've texted it to each of you.
This is just a blob.
A hot blob, and we must find him.
But be warned, he's elusive.
So if you spot him, pin him down and text me immediately.
- Are you sure...?
- There's no time!
Have you seen this blob?
Maybe it's hanging out with Rebecca somewhere.
- Birds of a feather...
- I can't find her.
- She missed the banana boat.
- I wouldn't worry too much.
Rebecca's a big girl.
It's time for the event you've all been waiting for.
Let's hear it for our spring break wet T- shirt contestants!
I might be able to take a break for a sec.
Recharge.
We want boobs!
No, you don't!
What the hell are you doing?
I'm gettin'rowdy!
- Get down from there.
- Set those glorious mounds free!
Mounds?
Really?
Fine.
Almond Joys!
You need to get down.
Get down from there.
- You're making a scene.
- Big sis is pissed.
You gonna tell my parents?
News flash: what I do on spring break is none of your business.
- It is when you're wearing ZBZ letters.
- Fine, I'll take them off.
Let me get my camera first.
You're seriously doing this?
This is really beneath you.
Beneath me?
- You know what's beneath me?
- Don't do this.
- Not right now, please.
- You're beneath me.
Whenever you're ready.
You can't even get over your ex-girlfriend.
- Don't bring me into this.
- You've always been in this.
And you always will be.
Maybe you should get up there, too.
My only regret:
wasting the last four months on you.
Stop acting like a spoiled daddy's girl who didn't get her way.
- It's a cliché.
- You know what?
We're done.
Consider this our spring breakup.
Don't go!
You chased the boobs away!
Are you OK?
- Man, where have you been?
- What?
I made some new friends.
Friends?
As in plural?
You guys, Chambers is on a roll!
All right, settle down.
What's going on?
You guys going to the condo?
What are you, my grandpa?
We're going to Paradox.
There's no way I'm going back to that club tonight.
- Wanna raid the vending machine?
- Sounds so good.
Let's go.
I'm sorry you had to drive all this way.
You can take us to the nearest bus station if you want.
I'll drive you guys back to Cyprus.
No big deal.
What about the hunting trip with your parents?
My mom's been hitting the firing range pretty hard, has developed quite an ego.
Do you wanna tell your side of the story first?
Not really.
We've got four more hours to go, It's been a long day.
- Let's get back to school.
- All right.
Anybody hungry?
I got some turkey jerky in the trunk.
I'm starving.
Did you kill it?
Does it matter?
You wanna jump out and find that jerky bag?
Trunk food.
I don't see anything back here.
It's back there.
Would you go help him?
There's really nothing back here.
I'm not letting either one of you jokers back in until you work out your issues.
You feeling better?
Feels like my brain is taking clogging lessons.
I was worried about you.
You got hit hard.
And then the drunk guy punched me.
- Do you have any idea why she...?
- Can we not talk about Rebecca?
Please It was awkward enough before all this.
You know what, you're right.
We're on spring break!
We get to spend an entire week on the beach with our best friends.
- There's only one more of these...
- One more?
Speak for yourself.
And they kick us out into the harsh reality of 40-hour work weeks.
Forty hours?
Wake up, Mary Tyler Moore.
Try 80.
In cubicles.
With two weeks vacation.
By the way, did I tell you I'm switching my major?
Anatomy was fun but less hands-on than I expected.
I'm sorry, Cap.
About what?
The fact that I don't have a "plan"?
About the fact that I judged you for it.
I was wrong.
- What has gotten into you?
- What do you mean?
You're so nice and carefree and beach-babe beautiful.
I feel like I'm in a tampon commercial.
That's because in four days I have to go back to school figure out what I wanna do with the rest of my life.
What about that ten-year plan?
Let's just say I copied off of someone's else's paper.
And now I don't know what I'll be doing in ten minutes.
I'm staring out into the... vast empty ocean that is my future.
Feels good, doesn't it?
It does.
And it feels terrifying.
Please unlock the doors.
No can do, buddy.
Not until you two make amends.
Look either turn off the music or leave us out here to die.
The scary thing is I actually knew the words to that song.
I just wished you would have at least called after the prank war thing.
Do you want to know why I didn't?
Because I was mad.
You made me feel like the bad guy because I chose to stay with OC and the friends I have there.
Like Evan Chambers?
When I was outed and was gonna quit the fraternity,
Evan asked me to trust him and I did.
- He hasn't let me down yet.
- Well, what about me?
I was the first person that you came out to, remember?
Doesn't that count?
It does, but you're demonizing a fraternity full of people I like...
It's hard to have a rational point-of-view of people when they're duct-taping you to the side of a building.
What about your fraternity?
The Kts are such good guys because they're laid back and aren't ambitious?
When did ambition become such a terrible attribute?
I think in the eighties.
You know, maybe they're right.
Maybe you just can't have friends who are in rival houses.
This is the officially the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
If your stupid houses are so important, why are both of you here now instead of down at Sinner's Beach?
You've gotta stop putting your houses before everything else in your life.
Before your schoolwork, before your roommate and before each other.
Think you can do that?
We can agree we were both wrong.
I'd say there was plenty of fault on both sides.
I'm sorry.
Sunburn.
The Three Musketeers are back!
Take me home!
I'm Betsy!
You sure are.
Loud and proud.
I'm so glad that we're sisters!
We really need to get you a boyfriend so he can manage these moments.
You're so soft!
He's here.
I smell him.
No, that might have been my chili dog.
I'm gonna come right back here and be disgusted by that comment.
But right now I need to run find someone.
So here, meet my friend, Mr. Lifeguard Stand.
I liked you on Baywatch.
Here we are.
Back at the hotel.
- You think you might wanna...?
- I don't think that's a good idea.
You've suffered head trauma.
Besides, there are ten people sleeping in my room.
I was going to say get some breakfast.
That sounds nice.
Let me go get my purse.
Ohio senator Ken Logan, known for his strong stance on family values, has been implicated in a sweep of a high-end prostitution ring.
As the nation reacts to the scandal, we'll have all the latest...
Go.
She needs you.
About tonight...
It was nothing.
"Kissing a boy on the beach" was 11 on my list.
Thanks for the help.
I'm starting to feel human again.
Processed food will do that for some reason.
I kinda feel like you've been blowing me off the past couple of days.
Not at all.
You had a lot of things you need to do this weekend.
You pushed me to be more assertive, and go after what I want.
Sorry things didn't work out with you and Casey...
I'm not.
I'm not looking to be another notch in the Myrtle Beach belt.
Warm body rule applies even here.
I've had plenty of warm bodies.
Million-dollar question:
Are you doing this because you want to be with me or because you wanna get back at Casey?
Both.
Million-dollar question:
Are you going to do this because you want to be with me or because you want to be with Evan Chambers?
Both.
It doesn't matter now.
I heard about your dad.
They didn't even call me.
I found out from a reporter.
What a night.
You can say that again.
Care to explain the flip flop?
It's proof that the Hot Ness Monster does exist.
And it gives me hope that I might see him again.
He made quite an impression.
Do you think it's possible to meet someone and just feel they're your soulmate?
But I have to believe that we have many soulmates.
If not, the world has a twisted sense of humor, right?
What happened tonight?
I was on a search mission for your monster when I ran into...
You know what, no.
I'm not gonna tell this story.
You've heard it a million times anyway.
- But it sounds important.
- What's important is...
I'm watching a beautiful sunrise with my best friend.
No matter what, we'll remember this moment forever.
You know what would make it even more memorable?
If we were naked.
Didn't see that coming.
It's the only thing left on my spring break list.
Skinny dipping.
Wanna?
- Please.
- Let's do it.
Dude, naked chicks!
You thinking what I'm thinking?
- Previsously...
- You're my little brother.
- To trust me, take this back.
- Going back to Omega Chi.
So Evan wins.
We said we weren't gonna let our houses get in the way of us being friends.
- You did nothing.
- It was a prank!
I used to see everything in terms of whether it would piss off my parents.
I just didn't want people to think I was dating you to get to her.
- You like Michael, right?
- I think so.
Gentlemen, it's time to get your fake Ids.
Chad Stewart.
I'm not interested in being anyone's warm body.
I'm gonna go tell Casey I'm an idiot and I want her back.
She wants us to be friends,
I said I was on board, but I don't think I am.
Did you pay Shane Mullen to stay away from me?
- How could you be so spiteful?
- I didn't do it to be.
- Why?
- Because I love you.
I think you should take some time.
- Get your head together.
- We're done.
Maybe instead of trying to keep all the guys away from one girl, find a girl who thinks you're the only guy.
Why do you want to be a lawyer?
It was easier to follow Evan's path.
I know what kind of law I want to practice: none.
Can you pick up my mail while you're...
You're packing?
It's spring break.
Why would I not be?
I assumed that you were gonna be sticking around campus.
I need a break.
I'm not a machine, contrary to what my academics imply.
So while you're submerged in surf, sand and sin with your fraternity brothers in South Carolina,
I am gonna be engaged in something far less reckless in Virginia.
You're...
- I have no idea.
- Wild turkey hunting with my family.
Killing turkeys is safer than going to the beach?
Are you familiar with the dangers of spring break?
Drunken injury?
Pregnancy?
Parasailing gone awry?
What about the people injured or killed while hunting?
They're just morons.
This is spring break.
This is the most sacred of college traditions.
Why waste that on your parents?
Do something with your friends, like take a road trip to warmer weather.
As if it ever gets that cold here.
Have fun killing turkeys.
Have fun perpetuating stereotypes of wasted, reckless, youth.
Two minutes, girls.
And windows...
Check.
The house is officially ready for lockdown, which means in two minutes I am officially on spring break!
I can feel the weight of my presidential duties lifting from my shoulders.
Could you put it on my suitcase?
We're going to Myrtle Beach for a week, not a year-long expedition to Mars.
I have to bring everything Teresa bought me.
- Teresa Visa.
She's very generous.
- But your card is a Credit Plus.
I know, but nothing cute rhymes with Credit Plus.
- There!
- Think this will fit in your car?
Lucky for you, I packed light.
All I need is sunscreen, a sarong and an iPod filled with beach music.
I'm leaving the rest of my baggage behind:
literally and figuratively.
No Jimmy Buffet.
We have plenty of time to listen to him when we are old and sad.
No Buffet.
No ex-boyfriends.
No Zeta Beta business.
Most of all, no worrying about the gaping hole that is my future.
I plan to flirt with boys and check things off the spring break list.
Oh my god, where did you find this?
In my old beach towel.
Remember when we made these freshman year?
We were such wide-eyed spring break virgins.
There are still things on here.
I'd like to finish it.
- Like what?
- Playing a drinking game, entering a contest and skinny dipping.
Casey Cartwright gone wild!
It's time.
Let's go, let's go!
Spring break awaits!
Lift off!
Season 1
- Episode 22 (FINAL) " Spring Broke "
- Synchro :
Kasius ¤AkaZab¤
Hurry up!
You're wasting valuable party time!
Get in here!
Welcome aboard.
We know you have many choices in travel and we thank you for choosing KT Air.
I love this bus.
It has taken the Kts to Myrtle Beach for 32 spring breaks in a row.
It is a legend.
Pledge Cartwright will be serving chips and fries in the main cabin.
And this bus makes only five stops and five stops only for gas.
- What about...?
- Only for gas.
So cool.
Come on, come on.
Are we there yet?
Wait for me!
Final answer!
Excuse me.
Hi, we're checking in.
Welcome to the Yacht House Inn, where your vacation is shipshape.
- How may I help you?
- Reservation under ZBZ, CRU Chapter.
Two rooms for the week.
Enjoy.
I said: "Final answer!"
I think there's been a mistake.
We have five rooms reserved.
No you don't.
We'll take three more rooms, please.
And you can put it on the card.
We're sold out, suge.
I don't know if you've heard, but it's spring break.
Connie?
We'd like some ice in my room, please, and a few extra towels.
Rebecca, you're here.
- And so are you, finally.
- How did you beat us?
We took her father's jet and it was awesome!
And Daddy's travel staff booked us this huge suite.
You should come up to our floor later.
Wait up.
There's been a minor snafu with our reservation.
Would you and the pledges be willing to share your rooms with us sisters?
After all, nobody wanna sleep on the floor.
Actually we're going to use this week to bond as a pledge class.
Having sisters in the room would change the dynamic, so...
No problem, little sis.
Who plans on sleeping anyway?
Check out this dingy motel.
This is even dingier than I imagined.
- Was that a...?
- It was a car backfiring, probably.
Whoever wants to hit downtown, we're leaving ahora!
Isn't this place great?
Only $199 a night!
Has anyone seen my bag?
Coming through!
Watch the outfit!
That's a brand-new flip...
- ... flop.
- Sorry.
I've got these giant clown feet that aren't always under my control.
Giant feet.
How about let my flip flop make it up to yours.
- How did you... do that?
- It's my secret weapon.
Double-fisting tonight, huh?
Just single-fisting.
I mean, I'm single.
Just an FYI.
I hope to see you around.
You will.
Where have you been?
That beer run was more of a marathon.
I just met the man I'm going to molest.
He is crazy gorgeous super generous.
He opened our beers with his shoe.
What's up?
So who is he?
Where's he from?
No clue!
That is the great thing about spring break!
All new boys to play with.
Please tell me it's not the guy in the doo-rag.
I know how you love men with accessories.
Where the hell is he?
I'm sure he's around here somewhere.
He's like Bigfoot.
He's the Hot Ness Monster.
This is a party!
It's great, huh?
It's like an Omega Chi party, only with less clothes.
And that, my friend, that is the beauty of spring break.
Some pretty chilly body language.
I think I'm ready for a new conversation.
- Happy spring break, Evs.
- Right back at ya, Frannie.
Keep moving.
Nothing to see here.
- Wishing you'd taken the jet?
- Miss Beaver moon a state trooper?
Never.
Our spring break pilgrimage is a sacred tradition.
If you want a ride home, the skies are very friendly.
Miss Logan, you're putting my tray table in its upright position.
- Let's go for a walk on the beach.
- But I was gonna meet the boys out.
We're gonna go to a bar with all-you-can-drink beer for $5.
- You spent all day with 'em on the bus.
- It's happy hour.
- You should come with us.
- Look around.
We've got you, me, the moon, sand, surf.
Pretty romantic, huh?
Spring break's for being rowdy, not romantic.
Our romance is often rowdy.
I guess I can take a little stroll.
Great!
I'll grab my jacket.
I'll grab a beer.
- If it isn't President Cartwright.
- Actually, it isn't.
Tonight I'm just Spring Break Cartwright.
With patented dual beer grip.
- A gift.
- Thank you.
I love gifts.
Enjoy.
I've got to get going.
We're playing Thumper.
A drinking game?
With your gag reflex?
It's on my spring break list.
Blast from the past.
- You gonna pierce your belly button?
- Once was enough, thank you.
I'm just tackling some unfinished business.
Like Thumper.
- You in?
- You might wanna find an easier target.
- Is anyone easier than you?
- How I would love to prove you wrong, but I promised a walk on the beach.
Very romantic.
- Am I interrupting something?
- Not at all.
Enjoy your walk.
Maybe we can spend two hours.
- Think of how far we've come.
- I just want to dance it out.
- I need to see Ids.
- What?
I'm a really good dancer.
Get ready.
Chad Stewart?
The musician?
Isn't that you?
We can say that guy stole your ID.
We'll totally back you up.
What are the odds?
I can't go in now.
We'll just go somewhere else.
It's OK.
I'm gonna go back to the motel.
I'll rest up for tomorrow night,
I'm gonna go bananas!
Ids, please.
Look at that line.
There's no way we're waiting in this line.
So we are looking for someone to buy drinks for.
Blueberry barnacle with a vita-boost, please.
Thank you.
I don't know what I was thinking.
That was at least 50 yards or something.
This shirt does not work.
- Sorry I missed you last night.
- Did you and the pledges get rowdy?
- You OK?
- Just a little asthma flair-up.
- If you need anything, let me know.
- Will do.
Healthy.
Cheers.
Are you in Myrtle?
Are you having fun?
Things are fine.
I'm just sitting on the beach.
Just relaxing from a full night of partying.
Are you using your inhaler?
You're so using your inhaler.
Liar.
I'm using my inhaler.
I meant about you having fun.
I just kind of expected this to be kinda the most amazing time of my life.
It's the New Year's Eve Syndrome.
It can't always live up to the hype.
I blame the media.
I've been up since 4am, when the rest of the pledges got home from that club that I couldn't get into because of stupid Chad Stewart.
- Who's Chad Stewart?
- I have no clothes.
I have no travel guide.
And, for some reason, my stupid asthma's back.
But the worst should be behind me, huh?
Are you wearing sun block?
Any spottings?
The Hot Ness Monster is an elusive beast.
What do you think, Mandi.
Over there?
Prime real estate.
That'll do, thank you.
Tropical Storm Rebecca.
I slept in the bathtub because of her, and now she's ruining our boy view.
Why can't she get over it?
Have you ever considered she might be threatened by you?
Why?
She's the senator's daughter with the invisible jet.
Because you're Zeta Beta president.
You're beautiful.
Go on.
You're the ex-girlfriend to a certain Cappie, with whom you looked pretty chummy last night.
In about five minutes, we start the sand castle contest.
Winners get free drinks at Club Paradox!
- Whatever.
- Cappie and I are finally friends.
Truly.
I'm over him.
Just like I'm over drama, remember?
Which means I'm not gonna let this beached whale get me depressed.
- Let's go build a sand castle!
- I don't want to get my bikini wet.
- Display purposes.
- Entering a contest is on my list.
You seem to not be enjoying the parade of possibility.
It's not really my kind of parade, you know?
We could go to the gay bar around here.
They have cages.
That was a lot of information.
When Casey and I came down here our sophomore year, she wanted to go...
She heard they had cages you could dance in.
So we went.
Thanks for the offer, but I'm not looking for a guy.
I miss the one I already have.
You remember when you're so excited about someone you want to spend every moment with them to make up for the time you're not together.
- I'm sorry.
- No, that's all right.
- You up for some volleyball?
- Absolutely.
What do you think?
It'll be fun.
- I don't know.
- Well, my friend thinks you're cute.
- You go.
Have fun.
- Are you sure?
Go on.
You're sure you have to go?
Honestly, I totally forgot that I have this project due or my polymeric materials class.
It's due on the Monday we get back.
Damn the competive world of polymer science.
Don't be too hard on yourself.
You can't win 'em all.
Travel safe, Spitter.
I got you a little gift for the road.
I'll see you next week.
No way.
- This is she.
- I'm calling from The Washington Post.
I don't need a subscription.
I'm in college.
I have no need for a newspaper.
Actually, this isn't about a subscription.
A matter we'd like to talk to you about if you have a couple moments.
Isn't this fun?
I haven't built a sand castle since I was 12.
Back when my biggest burden was having to play with Rusty.
I just wish there wasn't all this sand.
It lingers in places long after you leave the beach.
I think the Hot Ness Monster has breeched the surface.
Go get him!
I got it!
Sorry about that.
- Can I give you a hand?
- Actually, I could use a torso.
Lucky for you, I'm well-versed in torsos.
You sure you have time?
Rebecca's not planning another walk on the beach?
I've got all the time in the world.
As long as we're done by five.
She booked us a banana boat ride.
A banana boat?
You?
I'm man enough to ride a giant yellow phallus.
Besides, it's her first spring break.
I vaguely remember you riding one your freshman year.
It was the first thing I crossed off my list.
I guess it's the circle of life.
It's really good to see you so relaxed.
You're like your old self again.
But your mermaid is in dire need of a breast augmentation.
I'll be right back.
Wait up.
- Where are you headed?
- Back to my room.
- Thought I'd take a nap.
- Want some company?
Go, have fun.
Are you OK?
Why wouldn't I be?
Excuse me.
Folks, just got off with dispatch.
We should have another bus to take us back in about six hours.
Thanks very much.
- Where are you going?
- Gotta be a town up ahead.
I was gonna head over and find a car.
Can I go with you?
Suit yourself.
I think we need another round.
- I'll go get them.
- Let us contribute something.
What are you gonna contribute?
Thank you for your contribution.
You're welcome.
I'll get the drinks.
- What's up?
- This place is wild!
Look how packed it is.
I bet you've met a majority of the female population.
You wanna come hang out with us?
You go have fun.
I need to rent a car, please.
Just one-way to Cyprus, Ohio.
I need to see your driver's license and a major credit card.
When did you get your own credit card?
I'm sorry.
You gotta be at least 21 years of age to rent an automobile in the state of North Carolina.
I can die for my country but I can't rent a car?
I've heard that one before.
I'm sorry, the law's the law.
I'll get it.
And this is faker than my hair color.
There's no way on God's green earth that you're 24.
I am.
My name is Chad Stewart.
I live at 2343 Homer Terrace.
- What color are your eyes?
- What color?
That's what I thought.
- I'm gonna need to confiscate this.
- Take it.
It's cursed or something.
When did you get a fake ID?
- We shouldn't have left the bus.
- This isn't my fault.
I didn't invite you to join me.
I didn't want to let you walk off in the dark alone.
I feel so much safer now that you're here.
You're on your own.
I'm gonna get my own ride home.
Just how I wanted it.
Your target is about six-foot-two, brown hair, dreamy eyes.
And he's got a bottle opener in his flip-flop.
- Could you be a little more specific?
- Check your phones.
Yesterday, I got close but was thwarted by a rogue football game.
Luckily, I was close enough to snap a cell phone pic.
I've texted it to each of you.
This is just a blob.
A hot blob, and we must find him.
But be warned, he's elusive.
So if you spot him, pin him down and text me immediately.
- Are you sure...?
- There's no time!
Have you seen this blob?
Maybe it's hanging out with Rebecca somewhere.
- Birds of a feather...
- I can't find her.
- She missed the banana boat.
- I wouldn't worry too much.
Rebecca's a big girl.
It's time for the event you've all been waiting for.
Let's hear it for our spring break wet T- shirt contestants!
I might be able to take a break for a sec.
Recharge.
We want boobs!
No, you don't!
What the hell are you doing?
I'm gettin'rowdy!
- Get down from there.
- Set those glorious mounds free!
Mounds?
Really?
Fine.
Almond Joys!
You need to get down.
Get down from there.
- You're making a scene.
- Big sis is pissed.
You gonna tell my parents?
News flash: what I do on spring break is none of your business.
- It is when you're wearing ZBZ letters.
- Fine, I'll take them off.
Let me get my camera first.
You're seriously doing this?
This is really beneath you.
Beneath me?
- You know what's beneath me?
- Don't do this.
- Not right now, please.
- You're beneath me.
Whenever you're ready.
You can't even get over your ex-girlfriend.
- Don't bring me into this.
- You've always been in this.
And you always will be.
Maybe you should get up there, too.
My only regret:
wasting the last four months on you.
Stop acting like a spoiled daddy's girl who didn't get her way.
- It's a cliché.
- You know what?
We're done.
Consider this our spring breakup.
Don't go!
You chased the boobs away!
Are you OK?
- Man, where have you been?
- What?
I made some new friends.
Friends?
As in plural?
You guys, Chambers is on a roll!
All right, settle down.
What's going on?
You guys going to the condo?
What are you, my grandpa?
We're going to Paradox.
There's no way I'm going back to that club tonight.
- Wanna raid the vending machine?
- Sounds so good.
Let's go.
I'm sorry you had to drive all this way.
You can take us to the nearest bus station if you want.
I'll drive you guys back to Cyprus.
No big deal.
What about the hunting trip with your parents?
My mom's been hitting the firing range pretty hard, has developed quite an ego.
Do you wanna tell your side of the story first?
Not really.
We've got four more hours to go, It's been a long day.
- Let's get back to school.
- All right.
Anybody hungry?
I got some turkey jerky in the trunk.
I'm starving.
Did you kill it?
Does it matter?
You wanna jump out and find that jerky bag?
Trunk food.
I don't see anything back here.
It's back there.
Would you go help him?
There's really nothing back here.
I'm not letting either one of you jokers back in until you work out your issues.
You feeling better?
Feels like my brain is taking clogging lessons.
I was worried about you.
You got hit hard.
And then the drunk guy punched me.
- Do you have any idea why she...?
- Can we not talk about Rebecca?
Please It was awkward enough before all this.
You know what, you're right.
We're on spring break!
We get to spend an entire week on the beach with our best friends.
- There's only one more of these...
- One more?
Speak for yourself.
And they kick us out into the harsh reality of 40-hour work weeks.
Forty hours?
Wake up, Mary Tyler Moore.
Try 80.
In cubicles.
With two weeks vacation.
By the way, did I tell you I'm switching my major?
Anatomy was fun but less hands-on than I expected.
I'm sorry, Cap.
About what?
The fact that I don't have a "plan"?
About the fact that I judged you for it.
I was wrong.
- What has gotten into you?
- What do you mean?
You're so nice and carefree and beach-babe beautiful.
I feel like I'm in a tampon commercial.
That's because in four days I have to go back to school figure out what I wanna do with the rest of my life.
What about that ten-year plan?
Let's just say I copied off of someone's else's paper.
And now I don't know what I'll be doing in ten minutes.
I'm staring out into the... vast empty ocean that is my future.
Feels good, doesn't it?
It does.
And it feels terrifying.
Please unlock the doors.
No can do, buddy.
Not until you two make amends.
Look either turn off the music or leave us out here to die.
The scary thing is I actually knew the words to that song.
I just wished you would have at least called after the prank war thing.
Do you want to know why I didn't?
Because I was mad.
You made me feel like the bad guy because I chose to stay with OC and the friends I have there.
Like Evan Chambers?
When I was outed and was gonna quit the fraternity,
Evan asked me to trust him and I did.
- He hasn't let me down yet.
- Well, what about me?
I was the first person that you came out to, remember?
Doesn't that count?
It does, but you're demonizing a fraternity full of people I like...
It's hard to have a rational point-of-view of people when they're duct-taping you to the side of a building.
What about your fraternity?
The Kts are such good guys because they're laid back and aren't ambitious?
When did ambition become such a terrible attribute?
I think in the eighties.
You know, maybe they're right.
Maybe you just can't have friends who are in rival houses.
This is the officially the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
If your stupid houses are so important, why are both of you here now instead of down at Sinner's Beach?
You've gotta stop putting your houses before everything else in your life.
Before your schoolwork, before your roommate and before each other.
Think you can do that?
We can agree we were both wrong.
I'd say there was plenty of fault on both sides.
I'm sorry.
Sunburn.
The Three Musketeers are back!
Take me home!
I'm Betsy!
You sure are.
Loud and proud.
I'm so glad that we're sisters!
We really need to get you a boyfriend so he can manage these moments.
You're so soft!
He's here.
I smell him.
No, that might have been my chili dog.
I'm gonna come right back here and be disgusted by that comment.
But right now I need to run find someone.
So here, meet my friend, Mr. Lifeguard Stand.
I liked you on Baywatch.
Here we are.
Back at the hotel.
- You think you might wanna...?
- I don't think that's a good idea.
You've suffered head trauma.
Besides, there are ten people sleeping in my room.
I was going to say get some breakfast.
That sounds nice.
Let me go get my purse.
Ohio senator Ken Logan, known for his strong stance on family values, has been implicated in a sweep of a high-end prostitution ring.
As the nation reacts to the scandal, we'll have all the latest...
Go.
She needs you.
About tonight...
It was nothing.
"Kissing a boy on the beach" was 11 on my list.
Thanks for the help.
I'm starting to feel human again.
Processed food will do that for some reason.
I kinda feel like you've been blowing me off the past couple of days.
Not at all.
You had a lot of things you need to do this weekend.
You pushed me to be more assertive, and go after what I want.
Sorry things didn't work out with you and Casey...
I'm not.
I'm not looking to be another notch in the Myrtle Beach belt.
Warm body rule applies even here.
I've had plenty of warm bodies.
Million-dollar question:
Are you doing this because you want to be with me or because you wanna get back at Casey?
Both.
Million-dollar question:
Are you going to do this because you want to be with me or because you want to be with Evan Chambers?
Both.
It doesn't matter now.
I heard about your dad.
They didn't even call me.
I found out from a reporter.
What a night.
You can say that again.
Care to explain the flip flop?
It's proof that the Hot Ness Monster does exist.
And it gives me hope that I might see him again.
He made quite an impression.
Do you think it's possible to meet someone and just feel they're your soulmate?
But I have to believe that we have many soulmates.
If not, the world has a twisted sense of humor, right?
What happened tonight?
I was on a search mission for your monster when I ran into...
You know what, no.
I'm not gonna tell this story.
You've heard it a million times anyway.
- But it sounds important.
- What's important is...
I'm watching a beautiful sunrise with my best friend.
No matter what, we'll remember this moment forever.
You know what would make it even more memorable?
If we were naked.
Didn't see that coming.
It's the only thing left on my spring break list.
Skinny dipping.
Wanna?
- Please.
- Let's do it.
Dude, naked chicks!
You thinking what I'm thinking?
Hey, Bomber, what's for lunch?
Fish.
And chips?
And salad.
How come you never cook chips?
Saving you from cholesterol.
Yeah, but chips goes with fish, just like tomato sauce goes with meat pies.
Just like fat goes with a heart attack.
Yeah, but there's fat in the fish and the batter.
And those burgers you cooked yesterday.
So, uh, what's your problem with chips?
Food snob.
Are you a food snob?
Or the big question, Bomber, did you have a bad experience with a chip in your past?
You broke the record!
38 seconds.
You set me up?
You had 4 minutes and 22 seconds remaining.
They gave me five minutes for you to throw something.
Hey, I'm good.
Bomber by name, Bomber by nature.
What's going on?
Uh, Bomber was just teaching Spider how to juggle eggs.
That the gash, is it, Bomber?
Yes, Buffer.
Good.
Since you guys like throwing stuff at each other so much we'll have that up on deck now.
Drill in two minutes.
Yes, Buff.
OK, this exercise is designed to hone the skills of the boarding party when faced with a non-compliant FFV.
Swaino, Bomber, RO, you're my fishermen.
You'll be on board the FFV.
As the boarding party approaches you defend yourselves with this.
You are to offer passive resistance only, OK?
No weapons and no violence.
If the XO or myself call out your name, you're out.
This is an exercise only.
OK?
So don't get carried away.
Any questions?
Yeah, Buff, have I got time to get some rubber gloves?
I don't want to touch that.
No, you don't.
Buff, can I go to the toilet?
Let's go.
That's softer than the stuff they normally throw at us.
XO to Buffer, boarding party on approach.
Roger that.
Fishermen, stand by.
OK, Buffer, here we come.
Alright, let's get 'em.
Righto, in your own time.
Hit 'em.
Hit 'em hard.
Get out of it, navy.
Put your poles up, sir.
Put your poles up!
Get away, navy!
Have some fruit, boys.
Spider, this is for you.
Put the poles...
Ah!
You're out!
Just a flesh wound!
Righto, you're out, ET.
You're out!
Oi!
You're out.
Alright, pull your poles in.
Poles are coming in.
Get that pole in, Bomber.
Back off, navy!
Come on, Bomber, get that pole in.
Flaring!
We're going in.
Boarding!
Move.
Step back.
Ma'am.
Put down the weapon.
I mean it, ma'am.
Put the weapon down.
Now, step away from the cauliflower.
It's a broccoli, you idiot.
Turn around, please.
Put your hands behind your back, ma'am.
Bet you wouldn't have dropped it if it was a chip.
Bomb, look, there's a chip on your shoulder.
Chippy, chip, chip...
Hey, hey, hey!
Swaino!
Argh!
Righto, exercise is over!
You, in the RHIB, now!
Bomber.
What did I say?
"No contact, no violence. "
What the hell were you thinking?
If Swaino and I hadn't have grabbed him he'd have gone overboard and you'd be up on disciplinary charges.
I'm really sorry.
But it was just a push.
Sometimes I have a bit of a short fuse...
I don't care how you dress it up, you've got a serious problem with your temper.
Yes, Buffer.
What did he say to you?
Spider, that made you go him?
Nothing.
I'll be discussing this incident with the Swain and XO before I decide whether to lay charges.
What?
Buffer, I'll do anything...
If I had my way you'd be off this boat right now.
There is no room on boats for people with a short fuse.
You're a liability.
I'm so sorry.
It won't happen again.
No, it won't.
I suppose everyone's talking about me.
Oh, that's the part where you're supposed to say that they're not.
Oh, I don't do nice.
You could try Nikki.
Actually, I prefer honest.
I heard what Spider said to you on the boat.
He was teasing you about chips again - what is it with you and chips?
Every time I take a new posting, it's the same thing.
People trying it on with me.
RO, I just want to do my job, fit in.
Nobody likes me, do they?
No, nobody likes your temper.
Have you ever tried nice?
I'll stick with honest.
You're gonna be fine.
Really?
Yeah...
You're a good cook.
I thought the Charge was stabbed.
Did they hit him over the head as well, boss?
'Hammersley' go ahead.
He is doing Tai Chi.
Yeah.
And if you were doing it I wouldn't be asking, but it's the Charge.
Charge is fine, he's been given a clean bill of health.
Sir?
And he'll be getting a citation for his bravery.
Yes, RO?
I just got a call from Coastwatch - they've spotted two men adrift in a tinny
12 miles north of us.
Gosh, out here?
Yeah, one of them's signalling the plane, the other one doesn't appear to be moving.
Nav, plot this.
Yes, sir.
Starboard 10, steer 0-2-0.
Starboard 10, steer 0-2-0.
Do you hear there?
Navigator speaking.
We're altering course to investigate a small boat who appears to be in distress.
Stand by to recover by sea boat.
Any sign?
Where do you think they've come from?
Oh, no idea.
Oh, sir, we're coming up on the coordinates.
Anything on radar?
I've hooked a possible contact which might tie in but a tinny's so small, it's hard to pull out of the clutter.
Boss?
I have the tinny visual.
Green, 2-0.
Great, X.
Let's get the sea boat in the water.
Nav, away sea boat.
Wow.
Spider, I'm so sorry.
I really am...
It's fine, really.
Couldn't you just hit me or something and we'd be even?
I don't hit people.
Stuff you, then.
Spider!
Come on.
Hey, Buffer, do you need an extra hand?
Nah.
Visors down.
Ready in the sea boat!
Visors down, ready in the sea boat.
Carry on the sea boat.
Get them off me!
They're crawling on me.
Get them off me.
Help!
They're all over me.
Sir, just calm down, please.
Get them off me.
Get them off me!
Sir, calm down.
Get them off!
Help!
Get them off!
Sit down.
You right, Swaino?
Hey, sit down there.
You right, Swaino?
Yes, mate.
Yes.
Sit down.
Sit down.
Calm down.
You're safe, mate.
You're safe.
Righto, let's get him out of here.
Alright, hold it.
Righto, let's go!
They got so thirsty they started drinking salt water.
That stuff'll send you mad.
Sounds like it nearly did.
What's Swaino say?
He says they'll be fine once he gets them rehydrated.
How'd they get out here?
They anchored next to a coral reef and then they took their tinny off to go diving.
They go diving, they come up and see their boat motoring away.
Did they see who took her?
No.
And no sign of the boat that brought the thieves.
Well, this'd be the third taken in the last two months.
Did the boaties see which direction the boat was heading?
Yeah - south-east.
Come to south-east, Nav.
We're coming up on Truman Island.
Doesn't some rich bloke own the whole thing?
Yeah
- Ray Walsman.
We evacuated him some time back from the Samaru Islands.
Is that right?
You were off getting your dolphins at the time - or, at least, you were supposed to be.
God, I miss the submarines.
Nice bloke.
Said we should drop in if we were passing by.
Eyes front.
If these boat thieves have held to their same course, they would've passed right through here.
He might've seen something.
Or he might've been a target himself.
You want me to radio him, sir?
No.
Buffer, organise a shore party.
Sorted, boss.
Oh, take Bomber.
Use her or lose her, Buff.
She's no good as decoration.
Spider.
You two stay here and behave.
Where are you going?
To say hello.
She's way out of your league.
Nice to see you again.
What brings you to this neck of the woods?
We're following a stolen boat.
Wondered if you'd seen any vessels come past your island.
Yeah.
Nice to see you again.
Good to see you, sir.
You haven't got a phone on this fancy new boat of yours?
No, it's alright.
I know you wanted to have a stickybeak at my secret hideaway, didn't you?
And it's OK.
Come on, let me show you around.
No point having it if you can't show it off.
Hey there.
I'm Billy.
Or you can call me Spider.
Yeah, nice to meet you too.
You won't get very far if you give up that easily.
That doesn't sound very good.
No, but it gets me out of study.
Oh, uni?
Your stocks just went up 10 points.
No, Year 12.
What?
So you do school from here?
By correspondence.
Nice - no teachers, no classes, no detention.
No fun, no friends, nowhere to go out on the weekend.
Must be pretty cool living on an island, though.
Try being here six months.
It's a long way from anywhere.
Yeah, but, um, you've got, like, palm trees and sand and water.
And, um stunningly beautiful women.
We haven't seen anything pass by, not that we'd necessarily notice.
Might be worth keeping an eye out.
There's been an increase in boat thefts along this part of the coast.
You may become a target.
Yeah, well, don't worry about me, Captain.
I've got security.
Any unwelcome guests who turn up here might find they've bitten off more than they can chew.
Besides, my boat's in Cairns, picking up supplies.
It'll be there for a week.
So, um, you ever get to port?
Sometimes.
Thanks.
Um, 'cause I've got this concert on this weekend.
I'd love to go.
Cool.
But I won't be back on the mainland till my exams are over.
Well, maybe we could hook up then?
I'd like that.
Yeah, me too.
Are you sure I can't offer you guys a drink?
No.
We'd better get after these boat thieves.
Let me show you out.
So that's your number?
What are you doing?
Dad, I'm just getting some sun.
Catching pneumonia, more like.
You've already got a cold.
Go inside and do some study.
Or what?
You'll ground me?
Nice to see you again, Mike.
Likewise.
Boss, I think I found her.
Is that her?
That's her.
That's our boat.
Can't raise them on the radio, sir.
Keep trying.
Tell them if they don't acknowledge, we'll board them.
And draft me a op-rep to NAVCOM so they know what's happening.
No-one on deck or at the wheel, boss.
Who's sailing her?
Still not responding, sir.
Vessel right ahead, this is Australian warship 'Hammersley'
Stop or heave to - I intend to board you.
Buffer?
X!
Hands to boarding stations.
Hands to boarding stations.
Hands to boarding stations.
Assume damage control state three condition voyage.
X, I want you to lead, and watch your back.
We don't know how many there are.
Sir.
This is the Australian Navy.
Make your presence known.
If you are below deck, make your presence known now.
Going below deck, boss.
Hello.
Is anybody here?
He's dead.
Charlie 82, this is X-ray 82.
There is absolutely no indication of how this man died, sir.
There is no injury, no bruising.
Yeah, copy, X. Any identification?
No, sir.
No ID.
Look.
He has on his arm what looks like a military services tattoo.
Could be Russian.
Yeah, could be Russian.
He's a well-built guy.
Similar to the guys who stabbed Charge, boss.
Do you recognise him?
I can't positively ID him, no, sir.
If he is one of that team, what would they want with an old tub like that?
The bigger question is, what happened to him?
No wounds, nothing.
It's like he just stopped breathing.
Did you hear that, sir?
Affirmative.
Nothing more that we can do here.
OK, X. Prepare the boat for tow.
I'll inform the authorities.
Copy that.
Takes a hell of a lot to stop one of these boys from breathing.
A dead bloke?
On our boat?
Man, that's karma for you.
He pinches our boat, leaves us to die and he's the one who gets it?
You didn't see this man at all?
No way.
Like we said, all we saw was our boat sailing away.
So is the boat OK?
Is there any damage?
Or?
There doesn't appear to be.
So we can go back on board.
Oh, mate, your boat's a crime scene.
We're towing your boat back to port for the police to investigate.
You're kidding.
A man died on your boat.
They'll want to know why.
Sir?
Their ship's log and passports.
So they are who they say they are.
And they have been where they say they've been.
How long till we're ready to tow?
Spider and Buffer are setting it up now.
They're about 10 minutes off.
Do you want us to bring the body on board?
No, the police want us to keep it in situ.
Bomber's bagging the body now, sir.
Charge, congratulations on your gong.
Hardly brave, getting yourself stabbed.
You know, Charge, I never expected you to be a kind of Tai Chi kind of guy.
Yeah, physio makes me do that.
Physio?
Yep.
Not the shrink?
What shrink?
For relaxation post-trauma.
What trauma?
Some idiot stabs me with a screwdriver and missed all the important bits.
Engines are up and running.
Ready when you are, sir.
Thanks.
Hey, Charge?
The body on the boat - how'd you like to take a look at ET's video?
See if you recognise him?
Sure.
Charge?
Yeah, just, uh...
looking for something.
Well, come on, mate.
ET's waiting.
Yeah, yeah.
I'm coming.
OK.
You're a bit shaky there, mate.
Charge?
Is that one of them, Charge?
No.
No.
I...
I don't think so.
And you don't recognise the boaties?
No, just saw them when they came on board - a couple of hippies.
Nothing like these military guys.
Right.
Thanks, Charge.
So, what do we do now?
Now?
Nothing.
We've got a dead thief, no way of tracking his mates and a couple of boaties who picked an extremely unlucky time to go diving.
Do we leave it to the police?
I can't see what else we can do.
Although I would like to know what killed him.
OK, Nav, are we ready to start this tow?
All set, sir.
Sir, NAVCOM on the line.
We're heading straight back to Truman Island.
It's a medivac -
Walsman's daughter needs urgent transfer to hospital.
I'll look after this, RO.
What are you doing?
Dropping the tow.
Tidy that up, Spide.
Dropping the?
But I'm meant to be prepping lunch in 10.
Too bad.
Great.
Now I'm gonna be really popular.
Tough.
There's been a medivac.
Ray Walsman's daughter's collapsed.
What?
Carly Walsman?
What's wrong with her?
I don't know.
We stay here as the steaming party.
Could I swap with ET?
'Cause he would love to be here.
And I'm the second medic.
If there's a medical...
Ol!
You're both staying till the 'Hammersley' gets back!
Oh, that smell.
It's just a fridge.
Smells like a dead body to me.
Don't be ridiculous.
The guy's been dead a while, right?
Figures he'll start to decompose.
He's not in the sun.
He won't blow up for another 24 hours.
What?
Same as a dead cow.
Carly will be fine.
How do you know that?
She's rich.
Things don't go wrong for rich people.
Besides, Walsman's not gonna let anything happen to his precious little girl.
What?
Spider!
That moved!
The body bag just moved!
Spider, the bloke's dead.
Bomber!
He moved, alright?
I swear he did.
I've already seen him.
You'd better not be joking, Spider.
Buff, I'm not kidding.
The guy moved, I'm telling you.
He's brown bread.
No, I saw him move.
I swear I did, Buff.
Bomber Brown?
I didn't see anything.
Well, something weird's going on on this boat.
Don't you feel it?
Like the shadows or something, they're moving.
Buff, something happened to this guy.
Well, why don't you figure out what while you help Bomber fix us something to eat?
It's a congenital heart condition.
She gets some infection in her blood, it just...
I thought she just had a cold!
You do know it's only limited, what we can do on board?
Yeah, but you can get her to hospital.
Yeah.
No, Dad, you stay.
I don't...
Darling, I'm going to be beside you all the way.
You guys, you'll have to sort out the contract yourselves.
Alright?
OK.
Come on, let's go.
Captain, X.
We're heading down now, sir.
I like what you've done with your overalls, Nav.
OK, so how long's this gonna last for?
What?
This - you freezing me out.
We're professionals, aren't we?
Yeah, we're professionals.
Good.
Well, then, let's be just that - professional.
Look, no, I've got work to do and so do you.
Yes, ma'am.
RO!
Game's up, fellas.
Looks like we do this the hard way.
Fine by me.
Come on, fella.
You jump in, or we gun the motors and drag you back.
You ever see 'Jaws' Come on, hurry up.
Get in the boat.
There's lots of nasties in there.
So, something you want to tell us?
Rather tell the captain.
Alright, let's go.
My boys tell me you were swimming for shore.
Innocent men don't try to run away.
What's going on?
You know the dead man on your boat.
No, we don't.
You killed him, didn't you?
We'll get to the bottom of this.
One way or the other.
Hang in there, sweetheart.
We'll get you to hospital.
Yeah, Captain.
Copy.
Mr Walsman.
The navy has a helicopter on stand-by.
It'll be deployed as soon as we're in range.
How long?
Five hours.
Five hours?
!
We're going as fast as we can without blowing an engine.
That's my daughter!
We'll do everything we can.
This, uh, bacterial endo...
Endocarditis.
He says she could die because of it.
Is that right?
Well, if it goes untreated, it can be deadly.
I mean, all I can do is monitor her and give her fluids.
What she needs is IV antibiotics, but they can't do that till they take a blood sample.
What?
There's something weird with her blood pressure.
Weird how?
Well, if the infection had reached her heart, her blood...
BP should be really high, but it's not.
In fact, if anything, it's low.
So is there something else going on?
I don't know.
Look, alright, just do what Fleet Medical tell you.
Sir.
How's your malpractice insurance?
What?
Well, I'm guessing if anything happens to Daddy's little girl,
Walsman's gonna take your house and your firstborn.
Thanks, Robert.
You hear about people who get buried alive.
You know, they're in some sort of coma.
When they wake up, it's too late, they're six feet under.
I thought stockmen were superstitious.
No, they've dug up coffins and found claw marks in the wood.
People's fingernails scraping.
And why would they dig them up?
Maybe he's... paralysed.
You know, he's been given an injection or something.
Like those medical stories.
You know, you see them on TV.
You know, people are given the wrong anaesthetic, they feel the whole operation.
But they can't scream, they can't talk, they can't move...
Spider, if you're so sure he's alive, then check his pulse.
I'm not touching the dead guy!
Oh, right.
You're the medic.
I thought he wasn't dead.
Spider.
Mmm?
Stay right where you are.
What?
Just relax, stay calm.
Don't move a muscle.
What?
What are you talking about?
There's a snake behind you.
Yeah, good one.
Just relax.
Buffer?
Buffer!
Spider!
Whoo!
About time.
I'm starving.
Hey.
Buff, no.
It's an eastern brown.
They're deadly.
If we don't move, it won't attack, I promise.
We're fine.
They're volatile, but not if we stay calm, OK?
So just...
If anyone knows volatile...
We've been trying to get to the radio, Buff.
I'll, um...
I'll see if we're still in portable range.
Man, I hope you know what you're doing.
I do.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Papa 82, this is Bravo 82.
Over.
Papa 82, this is Bravo 82.
Over.
RO, this is Buffer.
This is an emergency.
Do you hear me?
Bravo 82, this is Papa 82.
What is your emergency?
Over.
You knew all along how that bloke died.
What are you talking about?
Don't even try it.
My crew found the snake.
You're responsible for that man's death.
He stole our boat.
He should never have been on it.
And what about my crew?
You could've warned me.
Instead, three of my sailors walked into a death trap.
If anything happens to them, there'll be charges.
Your crew...
What?
You said they found a snake.
Let's just make a run for it.
No way.
It's faster than you are, Spider.
You'll never make it.
Bomber!
We can't stay here all day.
Shh.
No, you can't.
That's not the only snake on board.
What?
!
Those boaties, they confessed.
They've been smuggling them.
Great.
Where are they?
That water container.
Ohh.
We better get outta here.
Don't!
Stay still.
That's why the bag was moving.
This place is crawling with them.
Bomber, what do we do?
I'm thinking.
Well, think quickly.
Just... relax.
Is there something wrong?
Well, you tell me.
I've taken your blood pressure every 10 minutes since we got back on the boat, and it's perfectly normal.
Which it wouldn't be if you really did have bacterial endocarditis.
And you're not showing any other symptoms.
So you're not really sick, are you?
Must get lonely on that island.
You have no idea.
I didn't think it'd be that big a deal, that Dad would come.
So what did you think?
I just wanted one Saturday night on the mainland and I know Dad would be angry, but it'd be worth it to have one night as a normal person.
You don't have to tell anyone.
I can pay you lots.
Dad gives me an allowance and I've got nowhere else to spend it.
I can't do it, Carly.
Please?
I'm sorry.
Nothing wrong with her?
There's gotta be some kind of mistake.
Look, you're a navy medic.
I want someone checking out my daughter who understands her condition.
I want her on that chopper.
The chopper's been called off.
What?
!
Mr Walsman, there's nothing wrong with your daughter.
She just wanted to get off the island.
Are you trying to tell me that she's faking?
Maybe she needs some friends her own age, you know?
Don't you dare tell me how to raise my daughter.
That'll be all, thanks, Swain.
Yes, sir.
Mr Walsman, you're right.
What happens between you and your daughter, it's your business.
But right now the navy's spending $10,000 an hour to get her to a hospital she doesn't need.
And while we're off on this wild goose chase,
I've got other members of my crew in a life-threatening situation and we can't help them.
I'll see that you and your daughter are comfortable until we dock in Cairns.
From there you can make your own arrangements to get back home.
I think you're supposed to grab them behind their necks.
That makes it even easier for them to bite you.
So what do we do, Bomber?
You can't stay down here, Bomber.
OK, Spider, when I say 'go'...
Yeah?
...you run to the stairs...
Straight to the snake?
It won't be there by then.
Buff, your cap.
You throw it off to the side.
Snakes are easily distracted.
They can't concentrate on two things at once.
And what are you gonna do?
Don't worry about me.
You sure you know what you're doing?
You ready?
Yeah.
Go!
Come on, Bomber.
Just run, Bomber!
I can't run.
I've got to keep slow.
Do you hear there?
Captain speaking.
In preparation of Charge's presentation, all personnel to muster on the wharf in ceremonial dress.
Hey, you don't want to be late.
Yep.
Are they chips?
It was never about the chips.
What was it about, then?
Promise you won't tell anyone?
Look, RO, I don't want anyone feeling sorry for me.
I don't do gossip.
There was an accident back home with the fryer.
I was cooking for the stockmen.
Mmm.
Camp kitchen burnt to the ground.
Is that why you've been worried about using the deep-fryer at sea?
Sort of.
One of the stockmen thought I was still in there.
And?
He went in after me and he got pretty badly burnt.
And people blamed you.
Nup.
That's what I couldn't face.
Their kindness.
So you ran away to join the navy.
Yeah.
Listen, look, we're all running from something.
You're ahead.
At least you know what you're running from.
Buff, these disciplinary charges -
I want to know if I'm gonna be suspended.
You know what I don't get?
How you can be the kind of person who loses the plot over something as stupid as chips but then you're put in a real crisis and you remain totally calm.
I don't want that first person on the 'Hammersley'
The second person I want her in my corner.
Just keep that temper in check.
Thank you, Buff.
They're all waiting for you, mate.
I don't deserve an award.
I'm not brave.
Almost got myself killed.
The only reason I'm here is 'cause he missed my pancreas by 2mm.
Did you talk about this with the shrink?
I didn't think there was anything to talk about.
It wasn't a problem when I was in the office in port and he was 1,000 miles away.
Hey...
No, don't.
No.
Sorry.
They're just happy you're still with us, mate.
That's all.
Alright, come on, let's go.
Hey, Bomber, what's for lunch?
Fish.
And chips?
And salad.
How come you never cook chips?
Saving you from cholesterol.
Yeah, but chips goes with fish, just like tomato sauce goes with meat pies.
Just like fat goes with a heart attack.
Yeah, but there's fat in the fish and the batter.
And those burgers you cooked yesterday.
So, uh, what's your problem with chips?
Food snob.
Are you a food snob?
Or the big question, Bomber, did you have a bad experience with a chip in your past?
You broke the record!
38 seconds.
You set me up?
You had 4 minutes and 22 seconds remaining.
They gave me five minutes for you to throw something.
Hey, I'm good.
Bomber by name, Bomber by nature.
What's going on?
Uh, Bomber was just teaching Spider how to juggle eggs.
That the gash, is it, Bomber?
Yes, Buffer.
Good.
Since you guys like throwing stuff at each other so much we'll have that up on deck now.
Drill in two minutes.
Yes, Buff.
OK, this exercise is designed to hone the skills of the boarding party when faced with a non-compliant FFV.
Swaino, Bomber, RO, you're my fishermen.
You'll be on board the FFV.
As the boarding party approaches you defend yourselves with this.
You are to offer passive resistance only, OK?
No weapons and no violence.
If the XO or myself call out your name, you're out.
This is an exercise only.
OK?
So don't get carried away.
Any questions?
Yeah, Buff, have I got time to get some rubber gloves?
I don't want to touch that.
No, you don't.
Buff, can I go to the toilet?
Let's go.
That's softer than the stuff they normally throw at us.
XO to Buffer, boarding party on approach.
Roger that.
Fishermen, stand by.
OK, Buffer, here we come.
Alright, let's get 'em.
Righto, in your own time.
Hit 'em.
Hit 'em hard.
Get out of it, navy.
Put your poles up, sir.
Put your poles up!
Get away, navy!
Have some fruit, boys.
Spider, this is for you.
Put the poles...
Ah!
You're out!
Just a flesh wound!
Righto, you're out, ET.
You're out!
Oi!
You're out.
Alright, pull your poles in.
Poles are coming in.
Get that pole in, Bomber.
Back off, navy!
Come on, Bomber, get that pole in.
Flaring!
We're going in.
Boarding!
Move.
Step back.
Ma'am.
Put down the weapon.
I mean it, ma'am.
Put the weapon down.
Now, step away from the cauliflower.
It's a broccoli, you idiot.
Turn around, please.
Put your hands behind your back, ma'am.
Bet you wouldn't have dropped it if it was a chip.
Bomb, look, there's a chip on your shoulder.
Chippy, chip, chip...
Hey, hey, hey!
Swaino!
Argh!
Righto, exercise is over!
You, in the RHIB, now!
Bomber.
What did I say?
"No contact, no violence. "
What the hell were you thinking?
If Swaino and I hadn't have grabbed him he'd have gone overboard and you'd be up on disciplinary charges.
I'm really sorry.
But it was just a push.
Sometimes I have a bit of a short fuse...
I don't care how you dress it up, you've got a serious problem with your temper.
Yes, Buffer.
What did he say to you?
Spider, that made you go him?
Nothing.
I'll be discussing this incident with the Swain and XO before I decide whether to lay charges.
What?
Buffer, I'll do anything...
If I had my way you'd be off this boat right now.
There is no room on boats for people with a short fuse.
You're a liability.
I'm so sorry.
It won't happen again.
No, it won't.
I suppose everyone's talking about me.
Oh, that's the part where you're supposed to say that they're not.
Oh, I don't do nice.
You could try Nikki.
Actually, I prefer honest.
I heard what Spider said to you on the boat.
He was teasing you about chips again - what is it with you and chips?
Every time I take a new posting, it's the same thing.
People trying it on with me.
RO, I just want to do my job, fit in.
Nobody likes me, do they?
No, nobody likes your temper.
Have you ever tried nice?
I'll stick with honest.
You're gonna be fine.
Really?
Yeah...
You're a good cook.
I thought the Charge was stabbed.
Did they hit him over the head as well, boss?
'Hammersley' go ahead.
He is doing Tai Chi.
Yeah.
And if you were doing it I wouldn't be asking, but it's the Charge.
Charge is fine, he's been given a clean bill of health.
Sir?
And he'll be getting a citation for his bravery.
Yes, RO?
I just got a call from Coastwatch - they've spotted two men adrift in a tinny
12 miles north of us.
Gosh, out here?
Yeah, one of them's signalling the plane, the other one doesn't appear to be moving.
Nav, plot this.
Yes, sir.
Starboard 10, steer 0-2-0.
Starboard 10, steer 0-2-0.
Do you hear there?
Navigator speaking.
We're altering course to investigate a small boat who appears to be in distress.
Stand by to recover by sea boat.
Any sign?
Where do you think they've come from?
Oh, no idea.
Oh, sir, we're coming up on the coordinates.
Anything on radar?
I've hooked a possible contact which might tie in but a tinny's so small, it's hard to pull out of the clutter.
Boss?
I have the tinny visual.
Green, 2-0.
Great, X.
Let's get the sea boat in the water.
Nav, away sea boat.
Wow.
Spider, I'm so sorry.
I really am...
It's fine, really.
Couldn't you just hit me or something and we'd be even?
I don't hit people.
Stuff you, then.
Spider!
Come on.
Hey, Buffer, do you need an extra hand?
Nah.
Visors down.
Ready in the sea boat!
Visors down, ready in the sea boat.
Carry on the sea boat.
Get them off me!
They're crawling on me.
Get them off me.
Help!
They're all over me.
Sir, just calm down, please.
Get them off me.
Get them off me!
Sir, calm down.
Get them off!
Help!
Get them off!
Sit down.
You right, Swaino?
Hey, sit down there.
You right, Swaino?
Yes, mate.
Yes.
Sit down.
Sit down.
Calm down.
You're safe, mate.
You're safe.
Righto, let's get him out of here.
Alright, hold it.
Righto, let's go!
They got so thirsty they started drinking salt water.
That stuff'll send you mad.
Sounds like it nearly did.
What's Swaino say?
He says they'll be fine once he gets them rehydrated.
How'd they get out here?
They anchored next to a coral reef and then they took their tinny off to go diving.
They go diving, they come up and see their boat motoring away.
Did they see who took her?
No.
And no sign of the boat that brought the thieves.
Well, this'd be the third taken in the last two months.
Did the boaties see which direction the boat was heading?
Yeah - south-east.
Come to south-east, Nav.
We're coming up on Truman Island.
Doesn't some rich bloke own the whole thing?
Yeah
- Ray Walsman.
We evacuated him some time back from the Samaru Islands.
Is that right?
You were off getting your dolphins at the time - or, at least, you were supposed to be.
God, I miss the submarines.
Nice bloke.
Said we should drop in if we were passing by.
Eyes front.
If these boat thieves have held to their same course, they would've passed right through here.
He might've seen something.
Or he might've been a target himself.
You want me to radio him, sir?
No.
Buffer, organise a shore party.
Sorted, boss.
Oh, take Bomber.
Use her or lose her, Buff.
She's no good as decoration.
Spider.
You two stay here and behave.
Where are you going?
To say hello.
She's way out of your league.
Nice to see you again.
What brings you to this neck of the woods?
We're following a stolen boat.
Wondered if you'd seen any vessels come past your island.
Yeah.
Nice to see you again.
Good to see you, sir.
You haven't got a phone on this fancy new boat of yours?
No, it's alright.
I know you wanted to have a stickybeak at my secret hideaway, didn't you?
And it's OK.
Come on, let me show you around.
No point having it if you can't show it off.
Hey there.
I'm Billy.
Or you can call me Spider.
Yeah, nice to meet you too.
You won't get very far if you give up that easily.
That doesn't sound very good.
No, but it gets me out of study.
Oh, uni?
Your stocks just went up 10 points.
No, Year 12.
What?
So you do school from here?
By correspondence.
Nice - no teachers, no classes, no detention.
No fun, no friends, nowhere to go out on the weekend.
Must be pretty cool living on an island, though.
Try being here six months.
It's a long way from anywhere.
Yeah, but, um, you've got, like, palm trees and sand and water.
And, um stunningly beautiful women.
We haven't seen anything pass by, not that we'd necessarily notice.
Might be worth keeping an eye out.
There's been an increase in boat thefts along this part of the coast.
You may become a target.
Yeah, well, don't worry about me, Captain.
I've got security.
Any unwelcome guests who turn up here might find they've bitten off more than they can chew.
Besides, my boat's in Cairns, picking up supplies.
It'll be there for a week.
So, um, you ever get to port?
Sometimes.
Thanks.
Um, 'cause I've got this concert on this weekend.
I'd love to go.
Cool.
But I won't be back on the mainland till my exams are over.
Well, maybe we could hook up then?
I'd like that.
Yeah, me too.
Are you sure I can't offer you guys a drink?
No.
We'd better get after these boat thieves.
Let me show you out.
So that's your number?
What are you doing?
Dad, I'm just getting some sun.
Catching pneumonia, more like.
You've already got a cold.
Go inside and do some study.
Or what?
You'll ground me?
Nice to see you again, Mike.
Likewise.
Boss, I think I found her.
Is that her?
That's her.
That's our boat.
Can't raise them on the radio, sir.
Keep trying.
Tell them if they don't acknowledge, we'll board them.
And draft me a op-rep to NAVCOM so they know what's happening.
No-one on deck or at the wheel, boss.
Who's sailing her?
Still not responding, sir.
Vessel right ahead, this is Australian warship 'Hammersley'
Stop or heave to - I intend to board you.
Buffer?
X!
Hands to boarding stations.
Hands to boarding stations.
Hands to boarding stations.
Assume damage control state three condition voyage.
X, I want you to lead, and watch your back.
We don't know how many there are.
Sir.
This is the Australian Navy.
Make your presence known.
If you are below deck, make your presence known now.
Going below deck, boss.
Hello.
Is anybody here?
He's dead.
Charlie 82, this is X-ray 82.
There is absolutely no indication of how this man died, sir.
There is no injury, no bruising.
Yeah, copy, X. Any identification?
No, sir.
No ID.
Look.
He has on his arm what looks like a military services tattoo.
Could be Russian.
Yeah, could be Russian.
He's a well-built guy.
Similar to the guys who stabbed Charge, boss.
Do you recognise him?
I can't positively ID him, no, sir.
If he is one of that team, what would they want with an old tub like that?
The bigger question is, what happened to him?
No wounds, nothing.
It's like he just stopped breathing.
Did you hear that, sir?
Affirmative.
Nothing more that we can do here.
OK, X. Prepare the boat for tow.
I'll inform the authorities.
Copy that.
Takes a hell of a lot to stop one of these boys from breathing.
A dead bloke?
On our boat?
Man, that's karma for you.
He pinches our boat, leaves us to die and he's the one who gets it?
You didn't see this man at all?
No way.
Like we said, all we saw was our boat sailing away.
So is the boat OK?
Is there any damage?
Or?
There doesn't appear to be.
So we can go back on board.
Oh, mate, your boat's a crime scene.
We're towing your boat back to port for the police to investigate.
You're kidding.
A man died on your boat.
They'll want to know why.
Sir?
Their ship's log and passports.
So they are who they say they are.
And they have been where they say they've been.
How long till we're ready to tow?
Spider and Buffer are setting it up now.
They're about 10 minutes off.
Do you want us to bring the body on board?
No, the police want us to keep it in situ.
Bomber's bagging the body now, sir.
Charge, congratulations on your gong.
Hardly brave, getting yourself stabbed.
You know, Charge, I never expected you to be a kind of Tai Chi kind of guy.
Yeah, physio makes me do that.
Physio?
Yep.
Not the shrink?
What shrink?
For relaxation post-trauma.
What trauma?
Some idiot stabs me with a screwdriver and missed all the important bits.
Engines are up and running.
Ready when you are, sir.
Thanks.
Hey, Charge?
The body on the boat - how'd you like to take a look at ET's video?
See if you recognise him?
Sure.
Charge?
Yeah, just, uh...
looking for something.
Well, come on, mate.
ET's waiting.
Yeah, yeah.
I'm coming.
OK.
You're a bit shaky there, mate.
Charge?
Is that one of them, Charge?
No.
No.
I...
I don't think so.
And you don't recognise the boaties?
No, just saw them when they came on board - a couple of hippies.
Nothing like these military guys.
Right.
Thanks, Charge.
So, what do we do now?
Now?
Nothing.
We've got a dead thief, no way of tracking his mates and a couple of boaties who picked an extremely unlucky time to go diving.
Do we leave it to the police?
I can't see what else we can do.
Although I would like to know what killed him.
OK, Nav, are we ready to start this tow?
All set, sir.
Sir, NAVCOM on the line.
We're heading straight back to Truman Island.
It's a medivac -
Walsman's daughter needs urgent transfer to hospital.
I'll look after this, RO.
What are you doing?
Dropping the tow.
Tidy that up, Spide.
Dropping the?
But I'm meant to be prepping lunch in 10.
Too bad.
Great.
Now I'm gonna be really popular.
Tough.
There's been a medivac.
Ray Walsman's daughter's collapsed.
What?
Carly Walsman?
What's wrong with her?
I don't know.
We stay here as the steaming party.
Could I swap with ET?
'Cause he would love to be here.
And I'm the second medic.
If there's a medical...
Ol!
You're both staying till the 'Hammersley' gets back!
Oh, that smell.
It's just a fridge.
Smells like a dead body to me.
Don't be ridiculous.
The guy's been dead a while, right?
Figures he'll start to decompose.
He's not in the sun.
He won't blow up for another 24 hours.
What?
Same as a dead cow.
Carly will be fine.
How do you know that?
She's rich.
Things don't go wrong for rich people.
Besides, Walsman's not gonna let anything happen to his precious little girl.
What?
Spider!
That moved!
The body bag just moved!
Spider, the bloke's dead.
Bomber!
He moved, alright?
I swear he did.
I've already seen him.
You'd better not be joking, Spider.
Buff, I'm not kidding.
The guy moved, I'm telling you.
He's brown bread.
No, I saw him move.
I swear I did, Buff.
Bomber Brown?
I didn't see anything.
Well, something weird's going on on this boat.
Don't you feel it?
Like the shadows or something, they're moving.
Buff, something happened to this guy.
Well, why don't you figure out what while you help Bomber fix us something to eat?
It's a congenital heart condition.
She gets some infection in her blood, it just...
I thought she just had a cold!
You do know it's only limited, what we can do on board?
Yeah, but you can get her to hospital.
Yeah.
No, Dad, you stay.
I don't...
Darling, I'm going to be beside you all the way.
You guys, you'll have to sort out the contract yourselves.
Alright?
OK.
Come on, let's go.
Captain, X.
We're heading down now, sir.
I like what you've done with your overalls, Nav.
OK, so how long's this gonna last for?
What?
This - you freezing me out.
We're professionals, aren't we?
Yeah, we're professionals.
Good.
Well, then, let's be just that - professional.
Look, no, I've got work to do and so do you.
Yes, ma'am.
RO!
Game's up, fellas.
Looks like we do this the hard way.
Fine by me.
Come on, fella.
You jump in, or we gun the motors and drag you back.
You ever see 'Jaws' Come on, hurry up.
Get in the boat.
There's lots of nasties in there.
So, something you want to tell us?
Rather tell the captain.
Alright, let's go.
My boys tell me you were swimming for shore.
Innocent men don't try to run away.
What's going on?
You know the dead man on your boat.
No, we don't.
You killed him, didn't you?
We'll get to the bottom of this.
One way or the other.
Hang in there, sweetheart.
We'll get you to hospital.
Yeah, Captain.
Copy.
Mr Walsman.
The navy has a helicopter on stand-by.
It'll be deployed as soon as we're in range.
How long?
Five hours.
Five hours?
!
We're going as fast as we can without blowing an engine.
That's my daughter!
We'll do everything we can.
This, uh, bacterial endo...
Endocarditis.
He says she could die because of it.
Is that right?
Well, if it goes untreated, it can be deadly.
I mean, all I can do is monitor her and give her fluids.
What she needs is IV antibiotics, but they can't do that till they take a blood sample.
What?
There's something weird with her blood pressure.
Weird how?
Well, if the infection had reached her heart, her blood...
BP should be really high, but it's not.
In fact, if anything, it's low.
So is there something else going on?
I don't know.
Look, alright, just do what Fleet Medical tell you.
Sir.
How's your malpractice insurance?
What?
Well, I'm guessing if anything happens to Daddy's little girl,
Walsman's gonna take your house and your firstborn.
Thanks, Robert.
You hear about people who get buried alive.
You know, they're in some sort of coma.
When they wake up, it's too late, they're six feet under.
I thought stockmen were superstitious.
No, they've dug up coffins and found claw marks in the wood.
People's fingernails scraping.
And why would they dig them up?
Maybe he's... paralysed.
You know, he's been given an injection or something.
Like those medical stories.
You know, you see them on TV.
You know, people are given the wrong anaesthetic, they feel the whole operation.
But they can't scream, they can't talk, they can't move...
Spider, if you're so sure he's alive, then check his pulse.
I'm not touching the dead guy!
Oh, right.
You're the medic.
I thought he wasn't dead.
Spider.
Mmm?
Stay right where you are.
What?
Just relax, stay calm.
Don't move a muscle.
What?
What are you talking about?
There's a snake behind you.
Yeah, good one.
Just relax.
Buffer?
Buffer!
Spider!
Whoo!
About time.
I'm starving.
Hey.
Buff, no.
It's an eastern brown.
They're deadly.
If we don't move, it won't attack, I promise.
We're fine.
They're volatile, but not if we stay calm, OK?
So just...
If anyone knows volatile...
We've been trying to get to the radio, Buff.
I'll, um...
I'll see if we're still in portable range.
Man, I hope you know what you're doing.
I do.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Papa 82, this is Bravo 82.
Over.
Papa 82, this is Bravo 82.
Over.
RO, this is Buffer.
This is an emergency.
Do you hear me?
Bravo 82, this is Papa 82.
What is your emergency?
Over.
You knew all along how that bloke died.
What are you talking about?
Don't even try it.
My crew found the snake.
You're responsible for that man's death.
He stole our boat.
He should never have been on it.
And what about my crew?
You could've warned me.
Instead, three of my sailors walked into a death trap.
If anything happens to them, there'll be charges.
Your crew...
What?
You said they found a snake.
Let's just make a run for it.
No way.
It's faster than you are, Spider.
You'll never make it.
Bomber!
We can't stay here all day.
Shh.
No, you can't.
That's not the only snake on board.
What?
!
Those boaties, they confessed.
They've been smuggling them.
Great.
Where are they?
That water container.
Ohh.
We better get outta here.
Don't!
Stay still.
That's why the bag was moving.
This place is crawling with them.
Bomber, what do we do?
I'm thinking.
Well, think quickly.
Just... relax.
Is there something wrong?
Well, you tell me.
I've taken your blood pressure every 10 minutes since we got back on the boat, and it's perfectly normal.
Which it wouldn't be if you really did have bacterial endocarditis.
And you're not showing any other symptoms.
So you're not really sick, are you?
Must get lonely on that island.
You have no idea.
I didn't think it'd be that big a deal, that Dad would come.
So what did you think?
I just wanted one Saturday night on the mainland and I know Dad would be angry, but it'd be worth it to have one night as a normal person.
You don't have to tell anyone.
I can pay you lots.
Dad gives me an allowance and I've got nowhere else to spend it.
I can't do it, Carly.
Please?
I'm sorry.
Nothing wrong with her?
There's gotta be some kind of mistake.
Look, you're a navy medic.
I want someone checking out my daughter who understands her condition.
I want her on that chopper.
The chopper's been called off.
What?
!
Mr Walsman, there's nothing wrong with your daughter.
She just wanted to get off the island.
Are you trying to tell me that she's faking?
Maybe she needs some friends her own age, you know?
Don't you dare tell me how to raise my daughter.
That'll be all, thanks, Swain.
Yes, sir.
Mr Walsman, you're right.
What happens between you and your daughter, it's your business.
But right now the navy's spending $10,000 an hour to get her to a hospital she doesn't need.
And while we're off on this wild goose chase,
I've got other members of my crew in a life-threatening situation and we can't help them.
I'll see that you and your daughter are comfortable until we dock in Cairns.
From there you can make your own arrangements to get back home.
I think you're supposed to grab them behind their necks.
That makes it even easier for them to bite you.
So what do we do, Bomber?
You can't stay down here, Bomber.
OK, Spider, when I say 'go'...
Yeah?
...you run to the stairs...
Straight to the snake?
It won't be there by then.
Buff, your cap.
You throw it off to the side.
Snakes are easily distracted.
They can't concentrate on two things at once.
And what are you gonna do?
Don't worry about me.
You sure you know what you're doing?
You ready?
Yeah.
Go!
Come on, Bomber.
Just run, Bomber!
I can't run.
I've got to keep slow.
Do you hear there?
Captain speaking.
In preparation of Charge's presentation, all personnel to muster on the wharf in ceremonial dress.
Hey, you don't want to be late.
Yep.
Are they chips?
It was never about the chips.
What was it about, then?
Promise you won't tell anyone?
Look, RO, I don't want anyone feeling sorry for me.
I don't do gossip.
There was an accident back home with the fryer.
I was cooking for the stockmen.
Mmm.
Camp kitchen burnt to the ground.
Is that why you've been worried about using the deep-fryer at sea?
Sort of.
One of the stockmen thought I was still in there.
And?
He went in after me and he got pretty badly burnt.
And people blamed you.
Nup.
That's what I couldn't face.
Their kindness.
So you ran away to join the navy.
Yeah.
Listen, look, we're all running from something.
You're ahead.
At least you know what you're running from.
Buff, these disciplinary charges -
I want to know if I'm gonna be suspended.
You know what I don't get?
How you can be the kind of person who loses the plot over something as stupid as chips but then you're put in a real crisis and you remain totally calm.
I don't want that first person on the 'Hammersley'
The second person I want her in my corner.
Just keep that temper in check.
Thank you, Buff.
They're all waiting for you, mate.
I don't deserve an award.
I'm not brave.
Almost got myself killed.
The only reason I'm here is 'cause he missed my pancreas by 2mm.
Did you talk about this with the shrink?
I didn't think there was anything to talk about.
It wasn't a problem when I was in the office in port and he was 1,000 miles away.
Hey...
No, don't.
No.
Sorry.
They're just happy you're still with us, mate.
That's all.
Alright, come on, let's go.
What the fuck?
Tell me something, Roger.
Set your watch back.
There's a time difference.
We're landing in Los Angeles.
It's a city in California.
Anything else you want to know?
You all right, Bryan?
You on edge?
Want a Valium?
Lude?
Gum?
I used to live here, didn't I?
What did he call it?
A talking tomato?
It's a fucking extraterrestrial, Ron.
So you're telling me that he's not gonna sign off..
until we redesign the talking tomato?
Well, that's bullshit.
Ron, listen, listen to me.
Let me inform you of something, okay?
We don't let 25- year- olds tell us how to make movies.
Listen, I gotta go.
I gotta go, Ron.
Just call..
Ron, call me later, okay?
Fast- acting Power Soap really gets in and blasts stains.
leaving your whole wash fresh and clean, with a brightness that people will really notice.
Wow.
That's incredible.
I thought that ketchup stain would never come out of Joe's polo shirt.
Whites simply come out whiter and colors simply come out brighter.
It's the kind of clean that people will really notice and talk about.
How did you lift those coffee stains?
I thought I was gonna have to throw my new pantsuit out.
I blasted it out with Power Soap.
..and lets you get on with your day.
President and Mrs. Reagan visited the grieving families and bereaved widows..
of the more than 200 Marines killed last Sunday in Beirut.
He used the occasion to condemn the actions of what he called..
ruthless terrorists who..
What time is it?
10:30.
Fuck.
Fuck.
We gotta go.
We're gonna be late.
Right.
That.
I forgot.
Christie, come on.
What are you doing?
I don't feel well.
I don't really want to go.
Neither do I.
Look, I'm not gonna let you..
Good morning.
Look, you want to know why you're not welcome at my house?
Because you're fucked up.
That's not a good enough reason.
That's not even a reason.
That's just one person's opinion.
Look, I don't even want to fucking deal with you right now, do you understand me?
Listen, I'm calling you from a payphone outside of Barstow, and I ain't got any more quarters.
It's simple.
Me and the Indian need a place to hang out for a couple of days.
We have a plan.
I don't want to hear about your fucking plan, Peter.
It doesn't involve you, so stop pissing yourself.
When you lose a child, you can't help but wonder what that child's life would have been like.
You can't help but imagine his future.
A future that now..
doesn't exist.
But Bruce lived a full life, and there's some comfort in that.
And that he was a good boy, and that he had done all the things he had ever wanted to do.
That the privilege and freedom that was granted to him..
during his brief time in this world were what made him happy.
I tell myself that I can only cherish one fact.
He had everything.
And now, in conclusion.
I'm going to play Bruce's favorite song.
It meant a lot to him.
Hi.
- Hi.
So I made the reservations for 8:30.
Where?
- Spago.
Okay.
Did you tell Susan and Graham?
Well, no.
I thought it was just gonna be the two of us.
William, I'm not really comfortable with that right now.
Okay.
Well, I'll call them and tell them to join us, then.
Or you could call them.
- No.
No, you should do that.
Okay.
What the fuck was with that favorite song, man?
Bruce had shitty taste in music, but no way.
Personally, I think his mom just liked it.
The real question is, what in the hell are my mom and dad doing by the sushi bar?
I mean, they're actually talking to each other.
At least your mom and dad are talking.
My mom gets to talk to my dad through his lawyers.
Guess what?
I get to go to Hawaii with the asshole.
I can't fucking believe this shit.
I can't believe you guys are acting this way.
Acting?
What way, Ray
- Ray?
Don't tell me he's gonna cry again.
Fuck.
Face it.
Bruce was a jerk.
Okay?
He's dead.
It's over.
Let's not fucking dwell on it.
I can't believe you guys don't fucking give a shit.
You seem like you don't give a shit.
Look, Raymond, there's nothing we can do, okay?
It happened.
It's over.
It's time to move on.
He's right, Raymond.
It's already been a week.
Okay, Bruce..
Bruce was a..
A cool guy.
What else can I tell you, Raymond?
I'm sorry it happened.
'Bruce was a cool guy'?
Really, Graham?
Okay, what does that even mean, 'Cool'?
Especially after that shit he pulled with Christie.
Martin, what the fuck are you doing?
- What shit did he pull with Christie?
Martin.
- Bruce was fucking her behind your back.
What, like, you all knew about this?
Graham, you always say that you're not that serious about Christie.
And it's not like you haven't fucked around.
You know, you're never gonna win Boyfriend of the Year.
She's my girlfriend, Martin.
- Look, who even knows if it's true?
It's just something Bruce told us and that he bragged about.
Hey, does anybody want to go to a movie?
Sure, what's playing?
I can't believe you guys are gonna go see a fucking movie.
What the..
I can't believe you don't give a shit, man.
I was there, you asshole.
- Hey, come on.
I watched him fucking bleed to death just like you did, so don't give me this shit about how I don't care.
I had his blood all over my face.
Fuck.
Someone should go talk to him.
Tim, Bruce thought Raymond was an asshole.
He fucking loathed the dude, okay?
And what the fuck does it even matter?
We're having a fucking wake at the Beverly Hilton.
I mean, come on, do you get it?
Come on.
Get up.
Bruce wouldn't want to see you like this.
He was my friend, right?
Yeah.
He was your friend.
Are you lying to me, Graham?
No.
I'm telling you the truth.
How's work?
It's good.
I have a full slate of movies that are testing really high.
There's one you might really like.
- Yeah?
What's that?
It's a movie about this 12- year- old boy who becomes the president.
The president of what?
The United States.
Sounds better than the one about the talking car.
How's Graham?
Well, you know your brother.
He's a little hard to reach.
But I'm sure he's upset about his friend's death, so, you know, it's tough.
When I saw him at the memorial, he seemed fine, though.
He seemed fine at Bruce's memorial?
Yeah.
So how's Cheryl, by the way?
I'm not seeing Cheryl anymore.
What?
When did this happen?
That's something I wanted to talk to you about, actually.
You talk to your mom lately?
- We talk.
You know, when she's coherent, which is rarely.
Why?
Well, Mom and I are moving back in together.
We're going to live together again.
She didn't tell me that.
How do you feel about that?
- Great.
Great.
This is a really good move.
Yeah.
Really good.
Seriously?
I mean, you really think it's great?
Well, to be honest, it hasn't totally hit me that you might actually be serious.
I'm serious.
We're going to be a family again.
Graham and I aren't moving back in, Dad.
We're not gonna be a family.
You and Mom are gonna be a couple again, but we're not gonna be a family.
Martin?
You can't call the house anymore.
Why?
Is there someone here who cares?
You just can't come over here anymore.
No.
- Are you going to tell me why?
William is moving back in.
Are you telling me he dumped the newscaster chick?
So..
Big Bad William is moving back in.
So the fuck what?
Unless you wanna shell out for a room at the Bel
- Air..
No, Martin.
Martin, you don't understand.
We can't do this anymore.
We can't do it.
It's over.
Right.
Just like it was over the last time?
Martin, don't.
Baby.
I see.
Well, could I at least..
borrow 60 bucks?
I have to pay this guy for these Billy Idol tickets.
And I forgot to go to the lnsta
- Teller and, you know..
You know, it's just really a massive hassle, so..
What can I do for you, Mr. Metro?
Can you just get these kids out of here, man?
Hey.
What are you doing?
Come on.
- All right.
Time to go.
No.
Hey, Jackson.
How's it hanging?
What the fuck are you doing here?
I told you I was coming.
What'd you think, it was a joke?
One fucking night.
And that's it.
You understand me?
Jackson, will you chill out, man, and show your Uncle Pete a little love, huh?
Well, where's this fucking indian friend of yours?
Indian's in the desert.
What the fuck does that even mean, 'The Indian's in the desert'?
Indian did some bad stuff.
Decided to stay in Barstow.
He's laying low, if you get my drift.
But Mary's in the van.
Who's Mary?
- Come on, I'll show you.
Jackson, this is Mary.
Mary?
Mary, this is Jackson.
Is she okay?
Yeah, she's sort of just taking it all in.
She saw some stuff.
Bothered her.
How old is this girl?
- I don't know.
Sixteen.
Seventeen.
I never ask.
Lucifer?
What the fuck are you doing with two underage kids?
How many times are we gonna go through this?
It does not matter if it was consensual.
I fucked up my hand.
How'd you do it?
Did someone help you?
I did it shaving, man.
Who the fuck cares?
My hand is fucked up.
Just..
Just call a doctor, Roger.
We are meeting Gary Gray, the movie producer.
You know, I don't know if I'm going to be able to make that meeting, Roger.
Look, I'll send the hotel doctor up and then you're gonna pull it together.
And when I knock on your door, you are going to answer it..
without your cock hanging out of some 14- year- old girl's ass.
Got it?
And you're going to be wearing something with long sleeves.
Why?
- Multiple choice.
A, you look nice in long sleeves.
B, you have holes in your arms.
C, you have holes in your arms.
Or D, you have holes in your arms.
C.
- Really?
Yeah?
Graham, it's for you.
It's Dirk.
- Shit.
Hey, Dirk.
Yeah.
What do you need?
Yeah, I can get that for you.
Okay.
A little business?
Yeah.
And my fucking car's at my mom's.
Can you give me a ride?
- Can't.
I'm going to Hawaii.
Well, fuck, dude, give me a better excuse than that.
I wish I could.
Thanks.
Aloha.
Can you give me a lift?
Don't look at me, dude.
Bye.
So how're you doing, Tim?
I'm good.
Fine.
How are you?
I'm doing good, I guess.
You want a drink?
- No, that's all right.
Come on.
Have a drink.
I'm okay.
- I'm gonna pour you one anyway.
So, what have you been up to?
Kind of a tough thing about that friend of yours dying, huh?
You want to talk about that?
- What time does the plane leave?
11:00 sharp.
You wanna hear something?
Who's this?
I think it's Devo.
- Who?
It's a group called Devo.
Great.
I love it.
Yeah.
Hey.
Hey.
I think it's great you could finally get away with your old man, you know?
Your mom said maybe you weren't gonna be able to make it.
But here you are.
- I'm here.
We're going to Hawaii.
It's gonna be great.
The virus's unknown origin and seeming selectivity is creating fear.
Gays, intravenous drug users and Haitians seem particularly to be at risk.
The virus reacts almost like a contagious form of cancer.
I'm trying to stay positive.
I think in my situation it's very..
And it's where film meets rock and we're all happy.
Bryan.
- Okay, an idea for a movie.
And the reason we came to Bryan Metro is because people remember..
how intense that movie turned out about the life of the band.
Holy Christ, man, the four of you guys, Sam and Matt and..
Ed.
His name was Ed.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
That's known as a real tragedy, huh?
A real shame.
Upsetting, too, I bet.
Right?
When your bassist jumps from the roof of the Clift Hotel, I'd say so.
They'd already split up by then, so..
Yeah.
Well, anyways, since that movie about the life of the band..
turned out to be so cool and so profitable, without exploiting anyone, we were wondering if you'd be pleased and thrilled..
to star in a movie, one where you would actually play yourself.
We get so many scripts.
Bryan turned down Amadeus, so we're very fussy.
Well, this movie is basically your typical rock- star- in- outer- space- type thing.
There's this alien creature, this ET.
ET?
- Extraterrestrial.
Alien.
Yeah.
The ET sabotages Bryan's limo after a gig, and there's a big fiery chase and somehow..
We haven't quite got that nailed yet..
- Yeah, go on.
You all end up on a planet where Bryan falls in love with a princess.
We're thinking Pat Benatar or a Go
- Go for that.
In order to escape the planet, you have to play in this big concert for the emperor, who's basically this giant tomato.
So it's madcap, right?
It's not tacky..
- Yes.
..and everyone is getting very excited by it.
Bryan?
Bryan.
Bryan?
Thank you so much for coming.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Christie, you know my sister, Susan, right?
Have you guys met?
- Yeah.
Hi.
Okay, well, I'm gonna get a drink.
Cool, baby.
You wanna bring me one, too?
- Nice shirt.
Ditto.
Does she always dress like that?
Movies, restaurants and stuff?
You a little jealous?
- Graham.
Hey, mellow out.
Did you know they were gonna go through with it?
What?
Mom and Dad?
Yeah.
Mom mentioned something when I woke up.
What a scandal, huh?
Oh, my God, you're so stoned.
You're such a stoner.
I can't even talk to you.
I'm really not stoned, okay?
Just mellow out.
You should talk to him.
- And say what exactly?
I don't know.'Dad, this isn't a good idea.
Don't go through..
Okay?
All right.
Let's take off, all right?
What do you say?
Graham, do you even care what he did to Mom?
And now he's back and he's just gonna do the same thing again.
Look, I had to take care of her, okay, Graham?
I had to take care of Mom, and I'm not gonna do it again.
Graham.
Graham.
Please.
We have to do something, okay?
If Dad pulls the same shit again, Mom isn't gonna make it.
This will destroy her.
Do you understand?
Cheryl, there's someone on the phone.
William Sloan.
- Thank you.
What?
- I called the house and no one answered.
I was hoping it was the wrong number.
Yeah, well, it's not the wrong number.
So why haven't you been home?
Because I've been busy.
I'm filling in for Suzanne Yakomiato.
I really want to see you.
What about Laura, William?
What about her?
What about Laura?
I think I really miss you.
I think I'm making a big mistake.
Let me go.
- Shut up.
Mary, go.
- I have no license.
Get in the fucking car and drive.
What do you think?
About what?
What do you think I mean?
Next to us.
Them.
What about them?
Don't you go out with girls?
Pardon me?
Don't you, like, date females?
What are you asking me?
The odds look good.
The odds look pretty good.
Ladies, what are you drinking tonight?
Pahohoes.
Pahohoes?
That sounds intriguing.
They're delicious.
Hey, Hickey?
Why don't you bring these two gorgeous ladies another round of pahohoes?
Where you gals from?
We came in from Chicago.
I'm Patty and this is Darlene.
Yeah.
The Windy City.
I know it well.
- Where are you both from?
Los Angeles.
City of Angels.
I'm Les Price and this is my son, Tim.
He's a little shy.
Just the two of you?
Just the two of us.
Hey.
I hope..
I hope I'm not being too forward if I may ask you something.
I'm sure you won't be, Les.
- Jesus.
Well, I was just wondering if you're here with anyone.
We're here alone.
- All alone.
All alone.
- Can I have the key to the room?
Where are you going?
- I'm going to the room.
Where do you think I'd be going?
You didn't finish your drink.
I don't want the drink.
Just give me the key.
I'll go up with you.
No.
Just stay here, see how it plays out with Patty and Marlene.
That's Darlene.
What's wrong with him, Les?
Troubles in school.
His mother.
- Okay.
No, no thanks.
You said you were hungry.
I made this for you.
No, my stomach's queasy.
I'm not really hungry anymore.
I really don't know how something like this could happen.
It all seemed to be going so well and now it's just a big mess.
It'll never happen again, I promise.
You're not gonna fire me, are you?
Well, no, I'm not gonna fire you.
Look, I have no idea what this is.
And another one on my foot.
- Yeah, I don't know what it is either.
Look, Christie, tell me something.
What?
What do you think about Martin?
He's cool.
He's hot.
Yeah, hot.
Well, I know that, but I'm just not sure
I'm at the same place that you are, you know, with everything that's been going on with him.
Forget it.
Sorry I brought it up.
Graham.
Martin's not even staying here.
He's staying at Nina Metro's.
Even though he said she was insane.
That reminds me.
Did you get tickets for tomorrow night at the Greek?
Bryan Metro?
Graham.
You know he doesn't mean as much as you to me.
Come on.
Graham, we're all just having fun, you know?
Like, you take it all so seriously.
Yeah, but you're also sleeping with him, and it's just stressing me out.
What's wrong?
You know I'm on the pill.
Graham?
Graham?
- Yeah?
You're forgetting something.
What?
We're both sleeping with him.
We're both sleeping with Martin.
And if I'm cool with that, then..
To new beginnings.
So I'm totally psyched.
We're gonna go see Bryan Metro..
at the Greek tomorrow night.
That is, if Graham remembered to get the tickets.
Yeah, I got the tickets, and stop saying 'totally.'
Who'd you get them from?
- Actually, honey, from me.
Through the studio.
- Good.
I'm glad he didn't go through Martin.
I didn't want to go through Martin, even though he could have gotten us backstage.
Who cares?
He's such a stoner.
He's so into himself.
Him and his totally grody tan and his stupid hair.
Plus, Mom, get this.
He's a male prostitute.
Why did you direct that statement to me?
- Just mellow out, okay?
I don't even know why we're talking about Martin.
And Mom, Martin's not a male prostitute.
That's on the record.
Why do you think I would care?
Martin is coming to the show with me and Christie, so I hope you get over how, 'like, totally grody' you think he is by tomorrow night.
I hope your girlfriend remembers to wear a shirt by tomorrow night.
Where are you going?
- I'm going to the restroom.
And hopefully, when I get back, my lovely children..
will have finished their conversation about their delightful friends.
Hi, honey.
You're here with her, aren't you?
Yeah.
- Oh, God.
No, don't.
Sweetie, I know you're pissed.
I understand, I understand.
But I missed you.
I couldn't help it.
I can't do this.
- You can't do what?
You don't want me anymore?
Sweetie, I want you so bad.
That's not the point, William.
I can't sit here again and listen to you quote numbers..
about how expensive your fucking divorce is gonna be.
Is it not enough that you've made everyone fucking miserable?
Just stay away.
Please.
You know, I kept the condo.
I haven't given it up yet.
We could meet there tomorrow night.
What do you say?
Or I got the Piper Cub back.
It's at the hangar.
It's ready to go.
We could fly to Vegas and stay at Caesars.
It'll be amazing.
- My God, William.
I'm not going to Vegas with you.
Well, at least you're going to be at the Brodkey benefit Friday, right?
We could talk there.
Okay?
Sure.
Why not?
- Great, honey.
That's what I want to hear.
It's so good to see your face.
We'll figure it out.
It'll be okay.
Yeah.
- Anyway, I better go.
Okay?
Fuck.
Laura, are we going to the Brodkey benefit on Friday?
Why would we go to the Brodkey benefit on Friday night?
That's TV.
It's not only TV.
And it should be fun.
Besides that, it's for a good cause.
- It's for a perfume, William.
I don't want to go to the Brodkey benefit Friday night.
What would you like to do instead?
Sleep?
Lay by the pool?
Maybe count your shoes?
Can Daddy borrow $4,000?
What the fuck are you still doing here?
I thought I told you to go.
What?
Are you gonna fucking ignore me?
What the fuck's going on?
What the fuck are you doing, Peter?
What the fuck did you do?
Answer me, Goddamn it.
Shut your mouth, Jack.
What the fuck?
The kid's gonna bring us some money.
That's the plan.
That's the plan I informed you about.
This is the plan.
Your fucking plan is goddamn holding a kid ransom?
It's not me, Jack.
It's them freaks I met out in West LA.
The people I heard about out in Barstow.
They pay $6,000, $7,000 a pop for a package like that.
You make me fucking sick.
Hey, man, you need to relax.
That's your problem, Jackson.
You don't know how to kick back.
Even when you was a kid out in the desert, and all there was was the sand and the rock and the silence, you could never accept the fact that that's where you belong, and that's where you're always gonna be.
That was a long time ago.
And we're not in the fucking desert anymore, Uncle Pete.
I think we still are.
Hello?
- ls Martin there?
I don't know.
Let me check.
Couldn't find him.
Do you know where he might be?
Have you tried his place in Westwood?
No, I haven't.
- He could be there, or he could be finishing up that music video on the hills.
ls this Julie?
- Julie?
Yeah.
The girl Martin picked up at 385 North?
With the white rabbit?
We all went back to my place and partied with Graham?
You and Martin disappeared?
Hello?
No.
This isn't her.
I'll call back.
Fuck me.
Cut.
Cut.
What the fuck are you doing, dude?
I can't see shit.
Hey, Graham.
- Yes, totally fucking excellent.
Perfect timing, dude.
We are so in need of your services.
Wait, hold on a second, Leon.
We really have to get this shot.
The video doesn't make sense without it.
It's a fucking video, Martin.
It doesn't need to make sense.
It just needs to be not lame.
Graham, you got us covered?
Yeah, man, you're all set.
- Totally excellent.
Hey, hey, hey.
Isn't Christie supposed to be here?
I thought she was supposed to be the star.
I did, too.
But she's a little unreliable.
Maybe you realize that now?
So, where are you staying tonight?
Probably at Nina's, in Malibu.
Who's Nina?
- Nina.
Nina Metro.
Bryan Metro's wife?
- Ex- wife.
Christ.
Where are you staying?
Honestly, Martin, I don't know how I feel about the situation anymore.
I think I'm just gonna crash at my mom's.
Look, I've got eight more shots.
- Yeah.
You're busy.
Can we shoot this, you fucking cokeheads?
Hey, Tim, why don't you get your old man another mai tai?
Hey.
- What?
Why don't you get your dad and yourself a drink?
What do you want?
- Mai tai.
Okay.
What are you up to?
Met a girl from San Diego.
Hey, come on.
Hey, Cheryl.
Nice to see you.
- Hi.
How are you, sweetie?
- Good.
I just wanted to grab a quick salad or something.
Do you have anything open?
- Sure.
Let me see.
Excuse me.
Shit.
Fuck you, you fucking asshole.
Hi.
- Hi.
What would you like, hun?
A garden salad and a glass of water, please.
Okay.
You're Cheryl Moore, right?
- Yeah.
I think you're great, honey.
- Thank you.
The piece you did on the anniversary of Sharon Tate.
I remember when that happened.
It was so awful.
Yeah.
- lt was just so sad.
Thank you.
- Yeah.
All right.
Hey.
Aren't you on the news or something?
Yes.
- You're Cheryl Moore, right?
Yeah.
Do you have a light?
- Sure.
Listen !
Can I have your autograph?
'Cause I am, like, your biggest fan.
There you go.
Thanks a lot, Cher.
By the way, we're opening for Bryan Metro at the Greek tonight.
You wanna go?
You know, I really don't think I can.
Got it.
Thanks a lot, Cheryl.
Hello?
What's going on?
How are you?
How did you get this number?
Did Roger give it to you?
Could I just speak to Jamie, please?
Well, he can't right now.
He's..
He's on the beach with a friend.
- Who?
A friend of his or a friend of yours?
You know, that's just great, Nina.
That's great.
Can we..
Can we just get this over with?
Can I just speak to my kid this time without having to freak out?
Please?
You know you don't even have visitation rights, Bryan.
Just put him on the phone, Nina.
No, I mean, I don't even know why you want me to say this..
Just tell whoever you're fucking..
to bring my kid out and put him on the phone.
Okay.
No.
You know what, Bryan?
I'm going to hang up now.
Just because I don't have visitation rights..
does not mean I'm not allowed to talk to my kid.
Now, if you want me to call my lawyers, Nina, I'll call my fucking lawyers.
Fuck your fucking lawyers, Bryan.
I'll call my fucking lawyers.
- Fuck them.
Fuck, all right, Nina, look, I'm sorry, man.
I'm sorry.
Please, Nina.
I don't mean to shout.
I just..
Bryan, listen to me.
Don't you fucking call me or him ever again.
He's fucking afraid of you.
Fucking afraid of me?
And don't fucking, You..
What about you, you Medusa?
You fucking Medusa.
Bryan.
Bryan.
Bryan.
Bryan.
- Bryan.
Bryan.
Bryan.
Bryan.
Bryan.
Bryan.
Bryan.
Bryan.
- Bryan.
Bryan.
Bryan.
Bryan.
Bryan.
Bryan.
Bryan.
Bryan.
- Bryan.
Bryan.
Bryan.
Bryan.
Good evening, sir.
Surprised?
Do you want to know who I am?
Are you from around here?
Not really.
I'm actually from Nebraska.
A little town near Lincoln.
You had a job at the mall, right?
But the mall closed down, right?
It's all empty now, huh?
Have you been there?
I've been to a mall in Nebraska.
It's all flat.
It's all totally, totally..
flat.
Come here.
Clear the area.
All of these vehicles need to be moved.
What's going on?
You scared me.
I don't know.
I guess some guy's like threatening to shoot his wife..
or maybe he shot her or something.
They got the SWAT team out there and everything, man.
If I were you, I wouldn't go out there.
- Yeah, I won't.
So you're on the eleventh floor, right?
Yeah, the guy who does the videos visits you all the time.
You mean Martin.
It's actually my girlfriend's place.
I'm Graham.
- Yeah, I know who you are.
You want a cigarette?
- Yeah.
It's..
It's kind of a small world, 'cause the guy who raised me out here?
He used to work at the studio your dad runs.
You know, so he was part of the system.
But I guess they had to let him go.
Something happened with some actress or something, and then he kind of had a breakdown, so we went back to Barstow.
But I came back here, 'cause I'm an actor.
I was in a commercial for gum, and I was the boyfriend in a Clearasil commercial.
You know, it's just kind of hard 'cause you can't really make it in this town..
unless you're really willing to do some awful things.
And, you know, I'm willing.
Yeah, I guess.
- But I really want to get into video.
That's why I was thinking that Mark guy would be a great contact.
It's Martin.
All right.
Well, thanks for the..
Yeah, absolutely.
- Yeah.
Hey, where you going?
I've got to drink some juice and then get some sleep.
You sure you don't want to stay?
I could really use the company.
Sorry, I gotta go.
I think something's gonna happen.
Les Price for two at 8:00.
It's actually three.
I asked Rachel.
- Who's Rachel?
The girl I met on the beach today.
And when were you going to tell me this?
I don't know.
Now, I guess.
I didn't think it would be a problem.
I mean, is it?
Well, I guess there's going to be three of us.
Hey, Tim.
- Hey, how are you?
Good, thanks.
Rachel, this is my dad, Les Price.
Hi, Mr. Price.
- Hello, Rachel.
You here in Hawaii on your own?
No, but my parents are in Maui tonight.
So, You both look nice.
Thanks, you look great.
- Yes.
You do.
So what did you two do after the beach today?
Well, I watched Tim perfect his hair for two hours, then spend another two hours choosing which shirt he's gonna wear.
Now I understand why.
So did anybody see that Robert Waters is here?
Who's that?
- Come on, Tim.
Robert Waters.
Star of The Flight Patrol.
It's a television show.
On television.
I don't know.
I guess I just must not watch enough TV.
Yeah, right.
Wait.
You don't know who Robert Waters is?
No, I don't.
You do, I guess?
- Well, I met him at Reagan's inauguration.
God, I thought everybody knew who Robert Waters is.
I don't.
Why do you guys care?
- Well, it's a little weird.
Why?
- He's here with three guys.
The very macho star of Flight Patrol is here with three dudes.
So?
So one of them tried to pick up Tim today.
Me?
When?
At the beach.
Today at the bar.
That guy?
- Yeah.
That guy.
Look, he was nice.
He was a nice guy.
Yeah, I'm sure he was really nice.
Real nice.
You smoke?
I told you, Tim.
- What?
It's bad for you.
- He knows.
I told him last night.
Am I blowing this in your face?
I mean, really?
Is this actually bothering you?
I mean, we're outside.
Look, you just shouldn't smoke, Tim.
Okay.
I'm gonna go finish this cigarette somewhere else, since you two don't like it.
The odds looking pretty good tonight, Dad?
Tim, stop.
- Let him go.
Well, thank you for dinner, Les.
Hey.
Hey.
We're not done here.
- No, look, just tell Tim that I'm sorry.
Let's have another drink.
Come on.
You know, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
Don't let him spoil the party.
Come on.
We're not going to another shitty party..
just because you're fucking the hostess, okay?
And she's married, and her husband's there.
I mean, you'll honestly fuck anybody, right?
I fucked you, dude.
Nice.
Where the fuck was Christie tonight?
Wasn't she supposed to be at the party?
Christ, I guess I forgot to tell you.
She hasn't been feeling too well.
She had to stay in.
Wait, are you staying at her place?
- No.
She moved in with me and Nina.
Nina..
Nina Metro, out in the colony?
- Yeah.
Since when?
- It's been a couple of days.
It's weird, she has these night sweats..
and swollen glands and this weird rash..
and these little purple bruises..
- Wait, she's sick?
Yeah.
She wanted to get out of the condo and hang at the beach.
She said she'd feel better there.
Martin, I need to know something.
Are you and Christie, like, fucking around?
You guys fuck around when I'm not there?
No.
No.
I wouldn't do that to you.
Holy shit.
You..
Wow.
You really, really like her, don't you?
This isn't just a thing for you.
You actually care about her.
I need something, Martin.
- You need some fucking ludes.
No, I need something more than this.
Graham, what else is there?
You already have everything.
I need someone to tell me what is good.
Okay?
And I need someone to tell me what's bad.
Because if nobody tells you these things, Martin, then how do you know what's good and what's bad?
And then what happens?
What happens..
What happens then, when nobody tells you these things?
Can I help you?
- Hi, I'm Dirk.
Who are you?
Nobody.
What the fuck do you want?
- I'm looking for someone.
Well, I'm the only one here, so..
- But I have something to pick up here.
I think you've probably got the wrong house.
Where's Peter?
He's not here.
- Dude, a deal was made.
Now I don't know who you are, but there's something here that now belongs to us.
Look, I don't want any trouble, so I think you should just leave, all right?
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, all right?
You got the wrong place.
- No.
This is the right place.
The fuck are you looking at?
Look, I told you, Peter's not here.
And I don't know anything about what the fuck you're talking about.
I'm just really tired.
- This is very important, so think carefully before you answer.
Tell me where the fuck Peter is.
I can't tell you that, 'cause I don't know.
This is simple.
Peter was paid.
We want what we paid for.
Now where is it?
- I swear to God, I don't know.
Well, you better find out because..
he will be in a very dark place if we become disappointed, and we're becoming extremely disappointed.
As soon as he gets back, I'll tell him.
I just don't know when that's gonna be.
I'll see you again.
Laura.
I..
I need a shot, and I couldn't find any syringes anywhere.
I mean, with the move and everything.
You don't have any, do you?
I've got one in here.
I saw her, William.
I saw her at the restaurant.
You saw who?
- Don't make me say her fucking name.
What are you talking about?
- Just go get dressed.
I'm not gonna have this conversation with you if you're going to lie.
I'm not going to do it.
I'm not going to do it anymore.
If you want to talk to me, you're going to tell me the truth.
Yeah, I want to talk to you.
- The other night at dinner.
When you came back and you sat down at the table..
and you said the Brodkeys' benefit.
I know why you want to go.
I know why you want to go.
Do you think I'm an idiot?
No.
- You know what I do wonder?
If you still have feelings for her, then why are you in this house?
Why are you still in this house?
Are you that selfish?
To think that I would stay here with you while you fucked her?
Is that what you're thinking?
Do you ever think about anybody else but yourself?
Do you ever think about me?
Do you ever think about your children?
Our children.
- Our children.
You did this for our children?
For Graham?
He's in college.
He deals drugs.
And he thinks you're a joke.
And Susan?
Susan loathes you.
- That's not true.
Yes, that is very true.
For one time, for one time in your goddamned life, be honest with me, William.
Did you ever love me?
Did you ever love me?
Tell me, did you ever love me..
- I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
You were afraid you'd be lonely, is that it?
You were afraid you'd have to give me 50% of everything you think you own, is that it?
No.
That's not what this is about.
God.
Oh, God.
I'll go to the benefit with you.
And we'll walk in there..
and we'll wink and we'll wave and we'll have drinks, and we'll let everybody know we're just fine.
And then you can come back home here..
and you can pack your things and you can leave.
So, yes, I'll go to the Brodkey benefit with you.
Why would you want to do that?
I want to see her.
Hey.
Where you been?
You weren't in the room.
Tim, what's wrong?
What happened?
What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong.
You want to talk?
Did you just ask me if I want to talk?
Well, yeah.
Yeah.
We could talk.
What?
What are we gonna talk about, Dad?
I don't know.
You tell me.
There's nothing to talk about.
Please..
Please, Tim, come on.
There's nothing to talk about.
Come on.
Give me a chance.
Don't ruin my chances.
You don't have any chances left to ruin, dude.
Come on, Tim, you don't mean that.
There's nothing.
There's nothing.
Just accept it.
It's easier that way.
Just forget it.
There's nothing you can tell me, and there's nothing I'm going to tell you, Dad, that's gonna make any difference.
Some fucking blond kid came by the house.
Yeah, what did he say?
He was asking me about a package.
- Yeah?
Did you give it to him?
No, I told him we didn't have it.
What?
What did Dirk say?
- What?
You know his fucking name?
What did Dirk say, Jack?
He said he'd be back.
- Fuck.
They're gonna kill us.
They're gonna kill us.
Who the fuck are these people?
I think it would be in our best interest if you get your shit..
and we get the fuck out of here, okay?
I told you.
I told you we shouldn't have come here.
Shut the fuck up, Mary.
Just get your shit and let's get out of here, okay?
No, it's not my fucking problem.
I got a fucking job.
I can't just fucking pack up and move.
You don't know what they're capable of, okay?
You ain't got a goddamn clue.
They're like out of a fucking nightmare.
So get your shit together and let's get the fuck out of here.
Come on, Mary.
What are you doing?
Listen, if we leave the kid here and they find him, this is a more humane way than letting them get their hands on him.
Let me do it.
Let you do what?
Let you do what?
- I'll handle it.
How are you gonna handle it?
I'm gonna cut his fucking throat.
Get the fucking van ready.
Come on, Mary.
Bryan.
Bryan.
Bryan.
Bryan.
- Bryan.
Bryan.
Bryan.
Bryan.
Clean yourself.
Just clean yourself up.
Hello?
- Yes, hello, I'm looking for Graham.
Yeah?
- Graham, it's Nina Metro.
I'm calling about..
- Who?
We've actually got an emergency with Christie.
I was hoping you could come down.
Hello, can I help you?
- Hi.
I'm Graham.
- You're Graham?
Yeah.
She's really sick.
She needs to see a doctor, but she's so stubborn, we can't talk her into it.
Well, where's her dad?
- He's on location in Italy.
That's an answer?
- She needs help, Graham.
Why do you think I can help her?
- Well, aren't you the one that loves her?
What's that gonna fix?
Is that gonna help her?
Hey.
What are you trying to tell me, baby?
What are you saying?
I want..
I want to stay.
But it's getting cold.
But I need more sun.
There's no more sun.
Hope YOU Enjoyed the Movie
What the fuck?
Tell me something, Roger.
Set your watch back.
There's a time difference.
We're landing in Los Angeles.
It's a city in California.
Anything else you want to know?
You all right, Bryan?
You on edge?
Want a Valium?
Lude?
Gum?
I used to live here, didn't I?
What did he call it?
A talking tomato?
It's a fucking extraterrestrial, Ron.
So you're telling me that he's not gonna sign off until we redesign the talking tomato?
Well, that's bullshit.
Ron, listen, listen to me.
Let me inform you of something, okay?
We don't let 25- year- olds tell us how to make movies.
Listen, I gotta go.
I gotta go, Ron.
Just call...
Ron, call me later, okay?
Fast- acting Power Soap really gets in and blasts stains,
leaving your whole wash fresh and clean, with a brightness that people will really notice.
Wow!
That's incredible.
I thought that ketchup stain would never come out of Joe's polo shirt.
Whites simply come out whiter and colors simply come out brighter.
It's the kind of clean that people will really notice and talk about.
How did you lift those coffee stains?
I thought I was gonna have to throw my new pantsuit out.
I blasted it out with Power Soap!
...and lets you get on with your day.
President and Mrs. Reagan visited the grieving families and bereaved widows of the more than 200 Marines killed last Sunday in Beirut.
He used the occasion to condemn the actions of what he called
"ruthless terrorists who..."
What time is it?
10:30.
Fuck.
Fuck.
We gotta go.
We're gonna be late.
Right.
That.
I forgot.
Christie, come on.
What are you doing?
I don't feel well.
I don't really want to go.
Neither do I.
Look, I'm not gonna let you...
Good morning.
Look, you want to know why you're not welcome at my house?
Because you're fucked up!
That's not a good enough reason.
That's not even a reason.
That's just one person's opinion.
Look, I don't even want to fucking deal with you right now, do you understand me?
Listen, I'm calling you from a payphone outside of Barstow, and I ain't got any more quarters.
It's simple.
Me and the Indian need a place to hang out for a couple of days.
We have a plan.
I don't want to hear about your fucking plan, Peter.
It doesn't involve you, so stop pissing yourself.
When you lose a child, you can't help but wonder what that child's life would have been like.
You can't help but imagine his future.
A future that now doesn't exist.
But Bruce lived a full life, and there's some comfort in that.
And that he was a good boy, and that he had done all the things he had ever wanted to do.
That the privilege and freedom that was granted to him during his brief time in this world were what made him happy.
I tell myself that I can only cherish one fact.
He had everything.
And now, in conclusion,
I'm going to play Bruce's favorite song.
It meant a lot to him.
- Hi.
- Hi.
So I made the reservations for 8:30.
- Where?
- Spago.
Okay.
Did you tell Susan and Graham?
Well, no.
I thought it was just gonna be the two of us.
William, I'm not really comfortable with that right now.
Okay.
Well, I'll call them and tell them to join us, then.
- Or you could call them.
- No.
No, you should do that.
Okay.
What the fuck was with that favorite song, man?
Bruce had shitty taste in music, but no way.
Personally, I think his mom just liked it.
The real question is, what in the hell are my mom and dad doing by the sushi bar?
I mean, they're actually talking to each other.
At least your mom and dad are talking.
My mom gets to talk to my dad through his lawyers.
Guess what?
I get to go to Hawaii with the asshole.
I can't fucking believe this shit.
I can't believe you guys are acting this way.
Acting?
What way, Ray
- Ray?
Don't tell me he's gonna cry again.
Fuck!
Face it.
Bruce was a jerk.
Okay?
He's dead.
It's over.
Let's not fucking dwell on it.
I can't believe you guys don't fucking give a shit.
You seem like you don't give a shit.
Look, Raymond, there's nothing we can do, okay?
It happened.
It's over.
It's time to move on.
He's right, Raymond.
It's already been a week.
Okay.
Bruce...
Bruce was a...
A cool guy.
What else can I tell you, Raymond?
I'm sorry it happened.
"Bruce was a cool guy"?
Really, Graham?
Okay, what does that even mean, "Cool"?
Especially after that shit he pulled with Christie.
- Martin, what the fuck are you doing?
- What shit did he pull with Christie?
- Martin.
- Bruce was fucking her behind your back.
What, like, you all knew about this?
Graham, you always say that you're not that serious about Christie.
And it's not like you haven't fucked around.
You know, you're never gonna win Boyfriend of the Year.
- She's my girlfriend, Martin.
- Look, who even knows if it's true?
It's just something Bruce told us and that he bragged about.
Hey, does anybody want to go to a movie?
Sure, what's playing?
I can't believe you guys are gonna go see a fucking movie.
What the...
I can't believe you don't give a shit, man.
- I was there, you asshole.
- Hey, come on!
I watched him fucking bleed to death just like you did, so don't give me this shit about how I don't care.
I had his blood all over my face.
Fuck.
Someone should go talk to him.
Tim, Bruce thought Raymond was an asshole.
He fucking loathed the dude, okay?
And what the fuck does it even matter?
We're having a fucking wake at the Beverly Hilton.
I mean, come on, do you get it?
Come on.
Get up.
Bruce wouldn't want to see you like this.
He was my friend, right?
Yeah.
He was your friend.
Are you lying to me, Graham?
No.
I'm telling you the truth.
How's work?
It's good.
I have a full slate of movies that are testing really high.
- There's one you might really like.
- Yeah?
What's that?
It's a movie about this 12- year- old boy who becomes the president.
The president of what?
The United States.
Sounds better than the one about the talking car.
How's Graham?
Well, you know your brother.
He's a little hard to reach.
But I'm sure he's upset about his friend's death, so, you know, it's tough.
When I saw him at the memorial, he seemed fine, though.
He seemed fine at Bruce's memorial?
Yeah.
So how's Cheryl, by the way?
I'm not seeing Cheryl anymore.
What?
When did this happen?
That's something I wanted to talk to you about, actually.
- You talk to your mom lately?
- We talk.
You know, when she's coherent, which is rarely.
Why?
Well, Mom and I are moving back in together.
We're going to live together again.
She didn't tell me that.
- How do you feel about that?
- Great.
Great.
This is a really good move.
Yeah.
Really good.
Seriously?
I mean, you really think it's great?
Well, to be honest, it hasn't totally hit me that you might actually be serious.
I'm serious.
We're going to be a family again.
Graham and I aren't moving back in, Dad.
We're not gonna be a family.
You and Mom are gonna be a couple again, but we're not gonna be a family.
Martin?
You can't call the house anymore.
Why?
Is there someone here who cares?
You just can't come over here anymore.
- No.
- Are you going to tell me why?
William is moving back in.
Are you telling me he dumped the newscaster chick?
So...
Big Bad William is moving back in.
So the fuck what?
Unless you wanna shell out for a room at the Bel
- Air...
No, Martin.
Martin, you don't understand.
We can't do this anymore.
We can't do it.
It's over.
Right.
Just like it was over the last time?
Martin, don't.
Baby.
I see.
Well, could I at least borrow 60 bucks?
I have to pay this guy for these Billy Idol tickets.
And I forgot to go to the lnsta
- Teller and, you know...
You know, it's just really a massive hassle, so...
What can I do for you, Mr. Metro?
Can you just get these kids out of here, man?
- Hey!
What are you doing?
Come on.
- All right.
Time to go.
No!
Hey, Jackson.
How's it hanging?
What the fuck are you doing here?
I told you I was coming.
What'd you think, it was a joke?
One fucking night.
And that's it.
You understand me?
Jackson, will you chill out, man, and show your Uncle Pete a little love, huh?
Well, where's this fucking indian friend of yours?
Indian's in the desert.
What the fuck does that even mean, "The Indian's in the desert"?
Indian did some bad stuff.
Decided to stay in Barstow.
He's laying low, if you get my drift.
But Mary's in the van.
- Who's Mary?
- Come on, I'll show you.
Jackson, this is Mary.
Mary?
Mary, this is Jackson.
Is she okay?
Yeah, she's sort of just taking it all in.
She saw some stuff.
Bothered her.
- How old is this girl?
- I don't know.
Sixteen.
Seventeen.
I never ask.
Lucifer?
What the fuck are you doing with two underage kids?
How many times are we gonna go through this?
It does not matter if it was consensual.
I fucked up my hand.
How'd you do it?
Did someone help you?
I did it shaving, man.
Who the fuck cares?
My hand is fucked up.
Just...
Just call a doctor, Roger.
We are meeting Gary Gray, the movie producer.
You know, I don't know if I'm going to be able to make that meeting, Roger.
Look, I'll send the hotel doctor up and then you're gonna pull it together.
And when I knock on your door, you are going to answer it without your cock hanging out of some 14- year- old girl's ass.
Got it?
And you're going to be wearing something with long sleeves.
- Why?
- Multiple choice.
A, you look nice in long sleeves.
B, you have holes in your arms.
C, you have holes in your arms.
Or D, you have holes in your arms.
- C.
- Really?
Yeah?
Graham, it's for you.
- It's Dirk.
- Shit.
Hey, Dirk.
Yeah.
What do you need?
Yeah, I can get that for you.
Okay.
A little business?
Yeah.
And my fucking car's at my mom's.
- Can you give me a ride?
- Can't.
I'm going to Hawaii.
Well, fuck, dude, give me a better excuse than that.
I wish I could.
Thanks.
Aloha.
Can you give me a lift?
Don't look at me, dude.
Bye.
So how're you doing, Tim?
I'm good.
Fine.
How are you?
I'm doing good, I guess.
- You want a drink?
- No, that's all right.
Come on.
Have a drink.
- I'm okay.
- I'm gonna pour you one anyway.
So, what have you been up to?
Kind of a tough thing about that friend of yours dying, huh?
- You want to talk about that?
- What time does the plane leave?
11:00 sharp.
You wanna hear something?
Who's this?
- I think it's Devo.
- Who?
It's a group called Devo.
Great.
I love it.
Yeah.
Hey.
Hey.
I think it's great you could finally get away with your old man, you know?
Your mom said maybe you weren't gonna be able to make it.
- But here you are.
- I'm here.
We're going to Hawaii.
It's gonna be great.
The virus's unknown origin and seeming selectivity is creating fear.
Gays, intravenous drug users and Haitians seem particularly to be at risk.
The virus reacts almost like a contagious form of cancer.
I'm trying to stay positive.
I think in my situation it's very...
And it's where film meets rock and we're all happy.
- Bryan.
- Okay, an idea for a movie.
And the reason we came to Bryan Metro is because people remember how intense that movie turned out about the life of the band.
Holy Christ, man, the four of you guys, Sam and Matt and...
- Ed.
His name was Ed.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
That's known as a real tragedy, huh?
A real shame.
Upsetting, too, I bet.
Right?
When your bassist jumps from the roof of the Clift Hotel, I'd say so.
They'd already split up by then, so...
Yeah.
Well, anyways, since that movie about the life of the band turned out to be so cool and so profitable, without exploiting anyone, we were wondering if you'd be pleased and thrilled to star in a movie,
one where you would actually play yourself.
We get so many scripts.
Bryan turned down Amadeus, so we're very fussy.
Well, this movie is basically your typical rock- star- in- outer- space- type thing.
There's this alien creature, this ET.
- ET?
- Extraterrestrial.
Alien.
Yeah.
The ET sabotages Bryan's limo after a gig, and there's a big fiery chase and somehow...
- We haven't quite got that nailed yet...
- Yeah, go on.
You all end up on a planet where Bryan falls in love with a princess.
We're thinking Pat Benatar or a Go
- Go for that.
In order to escape the planet, you have to play in this big concert for the emperor,
who's basically this giant tomato.
So it's madcap, right?
- It's not tacky...
- Yes.
...and everyone is getting very excited by it.
Bryan?
Bryan.
Bryan?
Thank you so much for coming.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Christie, you know my sister, Susan, right?
- Have you guys met?
- Yeah.
Hi.
Okay, well, I'm gonna get a drink.
- Cool, baby.
You wanna bring me one, too?
- Nice shirt.
Ditto.
Does she always dress like that?
Movies, restaurants and stuff?
- You a little jealous?
- Graham!
Hey, mellow out.
Did you know they were gonna go through with it?
What?
Mom and Dad?
Yeah.
Mom mentioned something when I woke up.
What a scandal, huh?
Oh, my God, you're so stoned.
You're such a stoner.
I can't even talk to you.
I'm really not stoned, okay?
Just mellow out.
- You should talk to him.
- And say what exactly?
I don't know. "Dad, this isn't a good idea.
Don't go through..."
Okay?
All right.
Let's take off, all right?
What do you say?
Graham, do you even care what he did to Mom?
And now he's back and he's just gonna do the same thing again.
Look, I had to take care of her, okay, Graham?
I had to take care of Mom, and I'm not gonna do it again!
Graham.
Graham!
Please.
We have to do something, okay?
If Dad pulls the same shit again, Mom isn't gonna make it.
This will destroy her.
Do you understand?
Cheryl, there's someone on the phone.
- William Sloan.
- Thank you.
- What?
- I called the house and no one answered.
I was hoping it was the wrong number.
Yeah, well, it's not the wrong number.
So why haven't you been home?
Because I've been busy.
I'm filling in for Suzanne Yakomiato.
I really want to see you.
What about Laura, William?
What about her?
What about Laura?
I think I really miss you.
I think I'm making a big mistake.
- Let me go!
- Shut up!
- Mary, go!
- I have no license.
Get in the fucking car and drive.
What do you think?
About what?
What do you think I mean?
Next to us.
Them.
What about them?
Don't you go out with girls?
Pardon me?
Don't you, like, date females?
What are you asking me?
The odds look good.
The odds look pretty good.
Ladies, what are you drinking tonight?
Pahohoes.
Pahohoes?
That sounds intriguing.
They're delicious.
Hey, Hickey?
Why don't you bring these two gorgeous ladies another round of pahohoes?
Where you gals from?
We came in from Chicago.
I'm Patty and this is Darlene.
Yeah.
The Windy City.
- I know it well.
- Where are you both from?
Los Angeles.
City of Angels.
I'm Les Price and this is my son, Tim.
He's a little shy.
Just the two of you?
Just the two of us.
Hey.
I hope...
I hope I'm not being too forward if I may ask you something.
- I'm sure you won't be, Les.
- Jesus.
Well, I was just wondering if you're here with anyone.
- We're here alone.
- All alone.
- All alone.
- Can I have the key to the room?
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the room.
Where do you think I'd be going?
You didn't finish your drink.
I don't want the drink.
Just give me the key.
I'll go up with you.
No.
Just stay here, see how it plays out with Patty and Marlene.
That's Darlene.
What's wrong with him, Les?
Troubles in school.
- His mother.
- Okay.
No, no thanks.
You said you were hungry.
I made this for you.
No, my stomach's queasy.
I'm not really hungry anymore.
I really don't know how something like this could happen.
It all seemed to be going so well and now it's just a big mess.
It'll never happen again, I promise.
You're not gonna fire me, are you?
Well, no, I'm not gonna fire you.
Look, I have no idea what this is.
- And another one on my foot.
- Yeah, I don't know what it is either.
Look, Christie, tell me something.
What?
What do you think about Martin?
He's cool.
He's hot.
Yeah, hot.
Well, I know that, but I'm just not sure
I'm at the same place that you are, you know, with everything that's been going on with him.
Forget it.
Sorry I brought it up.
Graham.
Martin's not even staying here.
He's staying at Nina Metro's.
Even though he said she was insane.
That reminds me.
Did you get tickets for tomorrow night at the Greek?
Bryan Metro?
Graham.
You know he doesn't mean as much as you to me.
Come on.
Graham, we're all just having fun, you know?
Like, you take it all so seriously.
Yeah, but you're also sleeping with him, and it's just stressing me out.
What's wrong?
You know I'm on the pill.
Graham?
- Graham?
- Yeah?
You're forgetting something.
What?
We're both sleeping with him.
We're both sleeping with Martin.
And if I'm cool with that, then...
To new beginnings.
So I'm totally psyched.
We're gonna go see Bryan Metro at the Greek tomorrow night.
That is, if Graham remembered to get the tickets.
Yeah, I got the tickets, and stop saying "totally."
- Who'd you get them from?
- Actually, honey, from me.
- Through the studio.
- Good.
I'm glad he didn't go through Martin.
I didn't want to go through Martin, even though he could have gotten us backstage.
Who cares?
He's such a stoner.
He's so into himself.
Him and his totally grody tan and his stupid hair.
Plus, Mom, get this.
He's a male prostitute.
- Why did you direct that statement to me?
- Just mellow out, okay?
I don't even know why we're talking about Martin.
And Mom, Martin's not a male prostitute.
That's on the record.
Why do you think I would care?
Martin is coming to the show with me and Christie, so I hope you get over how, "like, totally grody"
you think he is by tomorrow night.
I hope your girlfriend remembers to wear a shirt by tomorrow night.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the restroom.
And hopefully, when I get back, my lovely children will have finished their conversation about their delightful friends.
Hi, honey.
You're here with her, aren't you?
- Yeah.
- Oh, God.
No, don't.
Sweetie, I know you're pissed.
I understand, I understand.
But I missed you.
I couldn't help it.
- I can't do this.
- You can't do what?
You don't want me anymore?
Sweetie, I want you so bad.
That's not the point, William.
I can't sit here again and listen to you quote numbers about how expensive your fucking divorce is gonna be.
Is it not enough that you've made everyone fucking miserable?
Just stay away.
Please.
You know, I kept the condo.
I haven't given it up yet.
We could meet there tomorrow night.
What do you say?
Or I got the Piper Cub back.
It's at the hangar.
It's ready to go.
We could fly to Vegas and stay at Caesars.
- lt'll be amazing.
- My God, William,
I'm not going to Vegas with you.
Well, at least you're going to be at the Brodkey benefit Friday, right?
We could talk there.
Okay?
Sure.
- Why not?
- Great, honey.
That's what I want to hear.
It's so good to see your face.
We'll figure it out.
It'll be okay.
- Yeah.
- Anyway, I better go.
Okay?
Fuck!
Laura, are we going to the Brodkey benefit on Friday?
Why would we go to the Brodkey benefit on Friday night?
That's TV.
It's not only TV.
And it should be fun.
- Besides that, it's for a good cause.
- It's for a perfume, William.
I don't want to go to the Brodkey benefit Friday night.
What would you like to do instead?
Sleep?
Lay by the pool?
Maybe count your shoes?
Can Daddy borrow $4,000?
What the fuck are you still doing here?
I thought I told you to go.
What?
Are you gonna fucking ignore me?
What the fuck's going on?
What the fuck are you doing, Peter?
What the fuck did you do?
Answer me, God damn it!
Shut your mouth, Jack.
What the fuck?
The kid's gonna bring us some money.
That's the plan.
That's the plan I informed you about.
This is the plan.
Your fucking plan is goddamn holding a kid ransom?
It's not me, Jack.
It's them freaks I met out in West LA.
The people I heard about out in Barstow.
They pay $6,000, $7,000 a pop for a package like that.
You make me fucking sick.
Hey, man, you need to relax.
That's your problem, Jackson.
You don't know how to kick back.
Even when you was a kid out in the desert, and all there was was the sand and the rock and the silence,
you could never accept the fact that that's where you belong, and that's where you're always gonna be.
That was a long time ago.
And we're not in the fucking desert anymore, Uncle Pete.
I think we still are.
- Hello?
- ls Martin there?
I don't know.
Let me check.
Couldn't find him.
Do you know where he might be?
Have you tried his place in Westwood?
- No, I haven't.
- He could be there, or he could be finishing up that music video on the hills.
- ls this Julie?
- Julie?
Yeah.
The girl Martin picked up at 385 North?
With the white rabbit?
We all went back to my place and partied with Graham?
You and Martin disappeared?
Hello?
No.
This isn't her.
I'll call back.
Fuck me.
Cut.
Cut!
What the fuck are you doing, dude?
I can't see shit.
- Hey, Graham.
- Yes, totally fucking excellent.
Perfect timing, dude.
We are so in need of your services.
Wait, hold on a second, Leon.
We really have to get this shot.
The video doesn't make sense without it.
It's a fucking video, Martin.
It doesn't need to make sense.
It just needs to be not lame.
Graham, you got us covered?
- Yeah, man, you're all set.
- Totally excellent.
Hey, hey, hey.
Isn't Christie supposed to be here?
I thought she was supposed to be the star.
I did, too.
But she's a little unreliable.
Maybe you realize that now?
So, where are you staying tonight?
Probably at Nina's, in Malibu.
- Who's Nina?
- Nina.
Nina Metro.
- Bryan Metro's wife?
- Ex- wife.
Christ.
Where are you staying?
Honestly, Martin, I don't know how I feel about the situation anymore.
I think I'm just gonna crash at my mom's.
- Look, I've got eight more shots.
- Yeah.
You're busy.
Can we shoot this, you fucking cokeheads?
Hey, Tim, why don't you get your old man another mai tai?
- Hey.
- What?
Why don't you get your dad and yourself a drink?
- What do you want?
- Mai tai.
Okay.
What are you up to?
Met a girl from San Diego.
Hey, come on.
- Hey, Cheryl.
Nice to see you.
- Hi.
- How are you, sweetie?
- Good.
I just wanted to grab a quick salad or something.
- Do you have anything open?
- Sure.
Let me see.
Excuse me.
Shit!
Fuck you, you fucking asshole!
- Hi.
- Hi.
What would you like, hun?
A garden salad and a glass of water, please.
Okay.
- You're Cheryl Moore, right?
- Yeah.
- I think you're great, honey.
- Thank you.
The piece you did on the anniversary of Sharon Tate.
I remember when that happened.
It was so awful.
- Yeah.
- lt was just so sad.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
All right.
Hey!
Aren't you on the news or something?
- Yes.
- You're Cheryl Moore, right?
- Yeah.
Do you have a light?
- Sure.
Listen...
Can I have your autograph?
'Cause I am, like, your biggest fan.
There you go.
Thanks a lot, Cher.
By the way, we're opening for Bryan Metro at the Greek tonight.
You wanna go?
You know, I really don't think I can.
Got it.
Thanks a lot, Cheryl.
Hello?
What's going on?
How are you?
How did you get this number?
Did Roger give it to you?
Could I just speak to Jamie, please?
Well, he can't right now.
He's...
- He's on the beach with a friend.
- Who?
A friend of his or a friend of yours?
You know, that's just great, Nina.
That's great.
Can we...
Can we just get this over with?
Can I just speak to my kid this time without having to freak out?
Please?
You know you don't even have visitation rights, Bryan.
Just put him on the phone, Nina.
No, I mean, I don't even know why you want me to say this...
Just tell whoever you're fucking to bring my kid out and put him on the phone!
Okay.
No.
You know what, Bryan?
I'm going to hang up now.
Just because I don't have visitation rights does not mean I'm not allowed to talk to my kid.
Now, if you want me to call my lawyers, Nina, I'll call my fucking lawyers!
Fuck your fucking lawyers, Bryan!
- I'll call my fucking lawyers.
- Fuck them!
Fuck, all right, Nina, look, I'm sorry, man.
I'm sorry.
Please, Nina.
I don't mean to shout.
I just...
Bryan, listen to me.
Don't you fucking call me or him ever again.
He's fucking afraid of you!
Fucking afraid of me?
And don't fucking...
You...
What about you, you Medusa?
You fucking Medusa!
- Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
- Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
- Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
- Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
- Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
- Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Good evening, sir.
Surprised?
Do you want to know who I am?
Are you from around here?
Not really.
I'm actually from Nebraska.
A little town near Lincoln.
You had a job at the mall, right?
But the mall closed down, right?
It's all empty now, huh?
Have you been there?
I've been to a mall in Nebraska.
It's all flat.
It's all totally, totally flat.
Come here.
Clear the area.
All of these vehicles need to be moved.
What's going on?
You scared me.
I don't know.
I guess some guy's like threatening to shoot his wife or maybe he shot her or something.
They got the SWAT team out there and everything, man.
- lf I were you, I wouldn't go out there.
- Yeah, I won't.
So you're on the eleventh floor, right?
Yeah, the guy who does the videos visits you all the time.
You mean Martin.
It's actually my girlfriend's place.
- I'm Graham.
- Yeah, I know who you are.
- You want a cigarette?
- Yeah.
It's...
It's kind of a small world, 'cause the guy who raised me out here?
He used to work at the studio your dad runs.
You know, so he was part of the system.
But I guess they had to let him go.
Something happened with some actress or something, and then he kind of had a breakdown, so we went back to Barstow.
But I came back here, 'cause I'm an actor.
I was in a commercial for gum, and I was the boyfriend in a Clearasil commercial.
You know, it's just kind of hard 'cause you can't really make it in this town unless you're really willing to do some awful things.
And, you know, I'm willing.
- Yeah, I guess.
- But I really want to get into video.
That's why I was thinking that Mark guy would be a great contact.
It's Martin.
All right.
Well, thanks for the...
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Yeah.
Hey, where you going?
I've got to drink some juice and then get some sleep.
You sure you don't want to stay?
I could really use the company.
Sorry, I gotta go.
I think something's gonna happen.
Les Price for two at 8:00.
It's actually three.
- I asked Rachel.
- Who's Rachel?
The girl I met on the beach today.
And when were you going to tell me this?
I don't know.
Now, I guess.
I didn't think it would be a problem.
I mean, is it?
Well, I guess there's going to be three of us.
- Hey, Tim.
- Hey, how are you?
Good, thanks.
Rachel, this is my dad, Les Price.
- Hi, Mr. Price.
- Hello, Rachel.
You here in Hawaii on your own?
No, but my parents are in Maui tonight.
So...
You both look nice.
- Thanks, you look great.
- Yes.
You do.
So what did you two do after the beach today?
Well, I watched Tim perfect his hair for two hours, then spend another two hours choosing which shirt he's gonna wear.
Now I understand why.
So did anybody see that Robert Waters is here?
- Who's that?
- Come on, Tim.
Robert Waters.
Star of The Flight Patrol.
It's a television show.
On television.
I don't know.
I guess I just must not watch enough TV.
Yeah, right.
Wait.
You don't know who Robert Waters is?
No, I don't.
- You do, I guess?
- Well, I met him at Reagan's inauguration.
God, I thought everybody knew who Robert Waters is.
I don't.
- Why do you guys care?
- Well, it's a little weird.
- Why?
- He's here with three guys.
The very macho star of Flight Patrol is here with three dudes.
So?
So one of them tried to pick up Tim today.
Me?
When?
At the beach.
Today at the bar.
- That guy?
- Yeah.
That guy.
Look, he was nice.
He was a nice guy.
Yeah, I'm sure he was really nice.
Real nice.
You smoke?
- I told you, Tim.
- What?
- It's bad for you.
- He knows.
I told him last night.
Am I blowing this in your face?
I mean, really?
Is this actually bothering you?
I mean, we're outside.
Look, you just shouldn't smoke, Tim.
Okay.
I'm gonna go finish this cigarette somewhere else, since you two don't like it.
The odds looking pretty good tonight, Dad?
- Tim, stop.
- Let him go.
Well, thank you for dinner, Les.
- Hey.
Hey.
We're not done here.
- No, look, just tell Tim that I'm sorry.
Let's have another drink.
Come on.
You know, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
Don't let him spoil the party.
Come on.
We're not going to another shitty party just because you're fucking the hostess, okay?
And she's married, and her husband's there.
I mean, you'll honestly fuck anybody, right?
I fucked you, dude.
Nice.
Where the fuck was Christie tonight?
Wasn't she supposed to be at the party?
Christ, I guess I forgot to tell you.
She hasn't been feeling too well.
She had to stay in.
- Wait, are you staying at her place?
- No.
She moved in with me and Nina.
- Nina...
Nina Metro, out in the colony?
- Yeah.
- Since when?
- It's been a couple of days.
It's weird, she has these night sweats and swollen glands and this weird rash
- and these little purple bruises...
- Wait, she's sick?
Yeah.
She wanted to get out of the condo and hang at the beach.
She said she'd feel better there.
Martin, I need to know something.
Are you and Christie, like, fucking around?
You guys fuck around when I'm not there?
No.
No.
I wouldn't do that to you.
Holy shit.
You...
Wow.
You really, really like her, don't you?
This isn't just a thing for you.
You actually care about her.
- I need something, Martin.
- You need some fucking ludes.
No, I need something more than this!
Graham, what else is there?
You already have everything.
I need someone to tell me what is good.
Okay?
And I need someone to tell me what's bad.
Because if nobody tells you these things, Martin, then how do you know what's good and what's bad?
And then what happens?
What happens...
What happens then, when nobody tells you these things?
- Can I help you?
- Hi, I'm Dirk.
Who are you?
- Nobody.
What the fuck do you want?
- I'm looking for someone.
- Well, I'm the only one here, so...
- But I have something to pick up here.
I think you've probably got the wrong house.
Where's Peter?
- He's not here.
- Dude, a deal was made.
Now I don't know who you are, but there's something here that now belongs to us.
Look, I don't want any trouble, so I think you should just leave, all right?
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, all right?
- You got the wrong place.
- No.
This is the right place.
The fuck are you looking at?
Look, I told you, Peter's not here.
And I don't know anything about what the fuck you're talking about.
- I'm just really tired.
- This is very important, so think carefully before you answer.
Tell me where the fuck Peter is.
I can't tell you that, 'cause I don't know.
This is simple.
Peter was paid.
We want what we paid for.
- Now where is it?
- I swear to God, I don't know.
Well, you better find out because he will be in a very dark place if we become disappointed, and we're becoming extremely disappointed.
As soon as he gets back, I'll tell him.
I just don't know when that's gonna be.
I'll see you again.
Laura.
I...
I need a shot, and I couldn't find any syringes anywhere.
I mean, with the move and everything.
You don't have any, do you?
I've got one in here.
I saw her, William.
I saw her at the restaurant.
- You saw who?
- Don't make me say her fucking name.
- What are you talking about?
- Just go get dressed.
I'm not gonna have this conversation with you if you're going to lie.
I'm not going to do it.
I'm not going to do it anymore!
If you want to talk to me, you're going to tell me the truth!
- Yeah, I want to talk to you.
- The other night at dinner.
When you came back and you sat down at the table and you said the Brodkeys' benefit.
I know why you want to go.
I know why you want to go.
Do you think I'm an idiot?
- No.
- You know what I do wonder?
If you still have feelings for her, then why are you in this house?
Why are you still in this house?
Are you that selfish?
To think that I would stay here with you while you fucked her?
Is that what you're thinking?
Do you ever think about anybody else but yourself?
Do you ever think about me?
Do you ever think about your children?
- Our children.
- Our children!
You did this for our children?
For Graham?
He's in college.
He deals drugs.
And he thinks you're a joke.
- And Susan?
Susan loathes you!
- That's not true.
Yes, that is very true!
For one time, for one time in your goddamned life, be honest with me, William.
Did you ever love me?
Did you ever love me?
- Tell me, did you ever love me...
- I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
You were afraid you'd be lonely, is that it?
You were afraid you'd have to give me 50% of everything you think you own, is that it?
No.
That's not what this is about.
God.
Oh, God.
I'll go to the benefit with you.
And we'll walk in there and we'll wink and we'll wave and we'll have drinks, and we'll let everybody know we're just fine.
And then you can come back home here and you can pack your things and you can leave.
So, yes, I'll go to the Brodkey benefit with you.
Why would you want to do that?
I want to see her.
Hey!
Where you been?
You weren't in the room.
Tim, what's wrong?
What happened?
What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong.
You want to talk?
Did you just ask me if I want to talk?
Well, yeah.
Yeah.
We could talk.
What?
What are we gonna talk about, Dad?
I don't know.
You tell me.
There's nothing to talk about.
Please...
Please, Tim, come on.
There's nothing to talk about.
Come on.
Give me a chance.
Don't ruin my chances.
You don't have any chances left to ruin, dude.
Come on, Tim, you don't mean that.
There's nothing.
There's nothing.
Just accept it.
It's easier that way.
Just forget it.
There's nothing you can tell me, and there's nothing I'm going to tell you, Dad, that's gonna make any difference.
Some fucking blond kid came by the house.
Yeah, what did he say?
- He was asking me about a package.
- Yeah?
Did you give it to him?
No, I told him we didn't have it.
What?
- What did Dirk say?
- What?
You know his fucking name?
What did Dirk say, Jack?
- He said he'd be back.
- Fuck!
They're gonna kill us!
They're gonna kill us!
Who the fuck are these people?
I think it would be in our best interest if you get your shit and we get the fuck out of here, okay?
I told you.
I told you we shouldn't have come here.
Shut the fuck up, Mary!
Just get your shit and let's get out of here, okay?
No, it's not my fucking problem.
I got a fucking job.
I can't just fucking pack up and move.
You don't know what they're capable of, okay?
You ain't got a goddamn clue.
They're like out of a fucking nightmare.
So get your shit together and let's get the fuck out of here.
Come on, Mary!
What are you doing?
Listen, if we leave the kid here and they find him, this is a more humane way than letting them get their hands on him.
Let me do it.
Let you do what?
- Let you do what?
- I'll handle it.
How are you gonna handle it?
I'm gonna cut his fucking throat.
Get the fucking van ready.
Come on, Mary.
- Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
- Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Clean yourself.
Just clean yourself up.
- Hello?
- Yes, hello, I'm looking for Graham.
- Yeah?
- Graham, it's Nina Metro.
- I'm calling about...
- Who?
We've actually got an emergency with Christie.
I was hoping you could come down.
- Hello, can I help you?
- Hi.
- I'm Graham.
- You're Graham?
Yeah.
She's really sick.
She needs to see a doctor, but she's so stubborn, we can't talk her into it.
- Well, where's her dad?
- He's on location in Italy.
- That's an answer?
- She needs help, Graham.
- Why do you think I can help her?
- Well, aren't you the one that loves her?
What's that gonna fix?
Is that gonna help her?
Hey.
What are you trying to tell me, baby?
What are you saying?
I want...
I want to stay.
But it's getting cold.
But I need more sun.
There's no more sun.
What the fuck?
Tell me something, Roger.
Set your watch back.
There's a time difference.
We're landing in Los Angeles.
It's a city in California.
Anything else you want to know?
You all right, Bryan?
You on edge?
Want a Valium?
Lude?
Gum?
I used to live here, didn't I?
What did he call it?
A talking tomato?
It's a fucking extraterrestrial, Ron.
So you're telling me that he's not gonna sign off until we redesign the talking tomato?
Well, that's bullshit.
Ron, listen, listen to me.
Let me inform you of something, okay?
We don't let 25- year- olds tell us how to make movies.
Listen, I gotta go.
I gotta go, Ron.
Just call...
Ron, call me later, okay?
Fast- acting Power Soap really gets in and blasts stains,
leaving your whole wash fresh and clean, with a brightness that people will really notice.
Wow!
That's incredible.
I thought that ketchup stain would never come out of Joe's polo shirt.
Whites simply come out whiter and colors simply come out brighter.
It's the kind of clean that people will really notice and talk about.
How did you lift those coffee stains?
I thought I was gonna have to throw my new pantsuit out.
I blasted it out with Power Soap!
...and lets you get on with your day.
President and Mrs. Reagan visited the grieving families and bereaved widows of the more than 200 Marines killed last Sunday in Beirut.
He used the occasion to condemn the actions of what he called
"ruthless terrorists who..."
What time is it?
10:30.
Fuck.
Fuck.
We gotta go.
We're gonna be late.
Right.
That.
I forgot.
Christie, come on.
What are you doing?
I don't feel well.
I don't really want to go.
Neither do I.
Look, I'm not gonna let you...
Good morning.
Look, you want to know why you're not welcome at my house?
Because you're fucked up!
That's not a good enough reason.
That's not even a reason.
That's just one person's opinion.
Look, I don't even want to fucking deal with you right now, do you understand me?
Listen, I'm calling you from a payphone outside of Barstow, and I ain't got any more quarters.
It's simple.
Me and the Indian need a place to hang out for a couple of days.
We have a plan.
I don't want to hear about your fucking plan, Peter.
It doesn't involve you, so stop pissing yourself.
When you lose a child, you can't help but wonder what that child's life would have been like.
You can't help but imagine his future.
A future that now doesn't exist.
But Bruce lived a full life, and there's some comfort in that.
And that he was a good boy, and that he had done all the things he had ever wanted to do.
That the privilege and freedom that was granted to him during his brief time in this world were what made him happy.
I tell myself that I can only cherish one fact.
He had everything.
And now, in conclusion,
I'm going to play Bruce's favorite song.
It meant a lot to him.
- Hi.
- Hi.
So I made the reservations for 8:30.
- Where?
- Spago.
Okay.
Did you tell Susan and Graham?
Well, no.
I thought it was just gonna be the two of us.
William, I'm not really comfortable with that right now.
Okay.
Well, I'll call them and tell them to join us, then.
- Or you could call them.
- No.
No, you should do that.
Okay.
What the fuck was with that favorite song, man?
Bruce had shitty taste in music, but no way.
Personally, I think his mom just liked it.
The real question is, what in the hell are my mom and dad doing by the sushi bar?
I mean, they're actually talking to each other.
At least your mom and dad are talking.
My mom gets to talk to my dad through his lawyers.
Guess what?
I get to go to Hawaii with the asshole.
I can't fucking believe this shit.
I can't believe you guys are acting this way.
Acting?
What way, Ray
- Ray?
Don't tell me he's gonna cry again.
Fuck!
Face it.
Bruce was a jerk.
Okay?
He's dead.
It's over.
Let's not fucking dwell on it.
I can't believe you guys don't fucking give a shit.
You seem like you don't give a shit.
Look, Raymond, there's nothing we can do, okay?
It happened.
It's over.
It's time to move on.
He's right, Raymond.
It's already been a week.
Okay.
Bruce...
Bruce was a...
A cool guy.
What else can I tell you, Raymond?
I'm sorry it happened.
"Bruce was a cool guy"?
Really, Graham?
Okay, what does that even mean, "Cool"?
Especially after that shit he pulled with Christie.
- Martin, what the fuck are you doing?
- What shit did he pull with Christie?
- Martin.
- Bruce was fucking her behind your back.
What, like, you all knew about this?
Graham, you always say that you're not that serious about Christie.
And it's not like you haven't fucked around.
You know, you're never gonna win Boyfriend of the Year.
- She's my girlfriend, Martin.
- Look, who even knows if it's true?
It's just something Bruce told us and that he bragged about.
Hey, does anybody want to go to a movie?
Sure, what's playing?
I can't believe you guys are gonna go see a fucking movie.
What the...
I can't believe you don't give a shit, man.
- I was there, you asshole.
- Hey, come on!
I watched him fucking bleed to death just like you did, so don't give me this shit about how I don't care.
I had his blood all over my face.
Fuck.
Someone should go talk to him.
Tim, Bruce thought Raymond was an asshole.
He fucking loathed the dude, okay?
And what the fuck does it even matter?
We're having a fucking wake at the Beverly Hilton.
I mean, come on, do you get it?
Come on.
Get up.
Bruce wouldn't want to see you like this.
He was my friend, right?
Yeah.
He was your friend.
Are you lying to me, Graham?
No.
I'm telling you the truth.
How's work?
It's good.
I have a full slate of movies that are testing really high.
- There's one you might really like.
- Yeah?
What's that?
It's a movie about this 12- year- old boy who becomes the president.
The president of what?
The United States.
Sounds better than the one about the talking car.
How's Graham?
Well, you know your brother.
He's a little hard to reach.
But I'm sure he's upset about his friend's death, so, you know, it's tough.
When I saw him at the memorial, he seemed fine, though.
He seemed fine at Bruce's memorial?
Yeah.
So how's Cheryl, by the way?
I'm not seeing Cheryl anymore.
What?
When did this happen?
That's something I wanted to talk to you about, actually.
- You talk to your mom lately?
- We talk.
You know, when she's coherent, which is rarely.
Why?
Well, Mom and I are moving back in together.
We're going to live together again.
She didn't tell me that.
- How do you feel about that?
- Great.
Great.
This is a really good move.
Yeah.
Really good.
Seriously?
I mean, you really think it's great?
Well, to be honest, it hasn't totally hit me that you might actually be serious.
I'm serious.
We're going to be a family again.
Graham and I aren't moving back in, Dad.
We're not gonna be a family.
You and Mom are gonna be a couple again, but we're not gonna be a family.
Martin?
You can't call the house anymore.
Why?
Is there someone here who cares?
You just can't come over here anymore.
- No.
- Are you going to tell me why?
William is moving back in.
Are you telling me he dumped the newscaster chick?
So...
Big Bad William is moving back in.
So the fuck what?
Unless you wanna shell out for a room at the Bel
- Air...
No, Martin.
Martin, you don't understand.
We can't do this anymore.
We can't do it.
It's over.
Right.
Just like it was over the last time?
Martin, don't.
Baby.
I see.
Well, could I at least borrow 60 bucks?
I have to pay this guy for these Billy Idol tickets.
And I forgot to go to the lnsta
- Teller and, you know...
You know, it's just really a massive hassle, so...
What can I do for you, Mr. Metro?
Can you just get these kids out of here, man?
- Hey!
What are you doing?
Come on.
- All right.
Time to go.
No!
Hey, Jackson.
How's it hanging?
What the fuck are you doing here?
I told you I was coming.
What'd you think, it was a joke?
One fucking night.
And that's it.
You understand me?
Jackson, will you chill out, man, and show your Uncle Pete a little love, huh?
Well, where's this fucking indian friend of yours?
Indian's in the desert.
What the fuck does that even mean, "The Indian's in the desert"?
Indian did some bad stuff.
Decided to stay in Barstow.
He's laying low, if you get my drift.
But Mary's in the van.
- Who's Mary?
- Come on, I'll show you.
Jackson, this is Mary.
Mary?
Mary, this is Jackson.
Is she okay?
Yeah, she's sort of just taking it all in.
She saw some stuff.
Bothered her.
- How old is this girl?
- I don't know.
Sixteen.
Seventeen.
I never ask.
Lucifer?
What the fuck are you doing with two underage kids?
How many times are we gonna go through this?
It does not matter if it was consensual.
I fucked up my hand.
How'd you do it?
Did someone help you?
I did it shaving, man.
Who the fuck cares?
My hand is fucked up.
Just...
Just call a doctor, Roger.
We are meeting Gary Gray, the movie producer.
You know, I don't know if I'm going to be able to make that meeting, Roger.
Look, I'll send the hotel doctor up and then you're gonna pull it together.
And when I knock on your door, you are going to answer it without your cock hanging out of some 14- year- old girl's ass.
Got it?
And you're going to be wearing something with long sleeves.
- Why?
- Multiple choice.
A, you look nice in long sleeves.
B, you have holes in your arms.
C, you have holes in your arms.
Or D, you have holes in your arms.
- C.
- Really?
Yeah?
Graham, it's for you.
- It's Dirk.
- Shit.
Hey, Dirk.
Yeah.
What do you need?
Yeah, I can get that for you.
Okay.
A little business?
Yeah.
And my fucking car's at my mom's.
- Can you give me a ride?
- Can't.
I'm going to Hawaii.
Well, fuck, dude, give me a better excuse than that.
I wish I could.
Thanks.
Aloha.
Can you give me a lift?
Don't look at me, dude.
Bye.
So how're you doing, Tim?
I'm good.
Fine.
How are you?
I'm doing good, I guess.
- You want a drink?
- No, that's all right.
Come on.
Have a drink.
- I'm okay.
- I'm gonna pour you one anyway.
So, what have you been up to?
Kind of a tough thing about that friend of yours dying, huh?
- You want to talk about that?
- What time does the plane leave?
11:00 sharp.
You wanna hear something?
Who's this?
- I think it's Devo.
- Who?
It's a group called Devo.
Great.
I love it.
Yeah.
Hey.
Hey.
I think it's great you could finally get away with your old man, you know?
Your mom said maybe you weren't gonna be able to make it.
- But here you are.
- I'm here.
We're going to Hawaii.
It's gonna be great.
The virus's unknown origin and seeming selectivity is creating fear.
Gays, intravenous drug users and Haitians seem particularly to be at risk.
The virus reacts almost like a contagious form of cancer.
I'm trying to stay positive.
I think in my situation it's very...
And it's where film meets rock and we're all happy.
- Bryan.
- Okay, an idea for a movie.
And the reason we came to Bryan Metro is because people remember how intense that movie turned out about the life of the band.
Holy Christ, man, the four of you guys, Sam and Matt and...
- Ed.
His name was Ed.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
That's known as a real tragedy, huh?
A real shame.
Upsetting, too, I bet.
Right?
When your bassist jumps from the roof of the Clift Hotel, I'd say so.
They'd already split up by then, so...
Yeah.
Well, anyways, since that movie about the life of the band turned out to be so cool and so profitable, without exploiting anyone, we were wondering if you'd be pleased and thrilled to star in a movie,
one where you would actually play yourself.
We get so many scripts.
Bryan turned down Amadeus, so we're very fussy.
Well, this movie is basically your typical rock- star- in- outer- space- type thing.
There's this alien creature, this ET.
- ET?
- Extraterrestrial.
Alien.
Yeah.
The ET sabotages Bryan's limo after a gig, and there's a big fiery chase and somehow...
- We haven't quite got that nailed yet...
- Yeah, go on.
You all end up on a planet where Bryan falls in love with a princess.
We're thinking Pat Benatar or a Go
- Go for that.
In order to escape the planet, you have to play in this big concert for the emperor,
who's basically this giant tomato.
So it's madcap, right?
- It's not tacky...
- Yes.
...and everyone is getting very excited by it.
Bryan?
Bryan.
Bryan?
Thank you so much for coming.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Christie, you know my sister, Susan, right?
- Have you guys met?
- Yeah.
Hi.
Okay, well, I'm gonna get a drink.
- Cool, baby.
You wanna bring me one, too?
- Nice shirt.
Ditto.
Does she always dress like that?
Movies, restaurants and stuff?
- You a little jealous?
- Graham!
Hey, mellow out.
Did you know they were gonna go through with it?
What?
Mom and Dad?
Yeah.
Mom mentioned something when I woke up.
What a scandal, huh?
Oh, my God, you're so stoned.
You're such a stoner.
I can't even talk to you.
I'm really not stoned, okay?
Just mellow out.
- You should talk to him.
- And say what exactly?
I don't know. "Dad, this isn't a good idea.
Don't go through..."
Okay?
All right.
Let's take off, all right?
What do you say?
Graham, do you even care what he did to Mom?
And now he's back and he's just gonna do the same thing again.
Look, I had to take care of her, okay, Graham?
I had to take care of Mom, and I'm not gonna do it again!
Graham.
Graham!
Please.
We have to do something, okay?
If Dad pulls the same shit again, Mom isn't gonna make it.
This will destroy her.
Do you understand?
Cheryl, there's someone on the phone.
- William Sloan.
- Thank you.
- What?
- I called the house and no one answered.
I was hoping it was the wrong number.
Yeah, well, it's not the wrong number.
So why haven't you been home?
Because I've been busy.
I'm filling in for Suzanne Yakomiato.
I really want to see you.
What about Laura, William?
What about her?
What about Laura?
I think I really miss you.
I think I'm making a big mistake.
- Let me go!
- Shut up!
- Mary, go!
- I have no license.
Get in the fucking car and drive.
What do you think?
About what?
What do you think I mean?
Next to us.
Them.
What about them?
Don't you go out with girls?
Pardon me?
Don't you, like, date females?
What are you asking me?
The odds look good.
The odds look pretty good.
Ladies, what are you drinking tonight?
Pahohoes.
Pahohoes?
That sounds intriguing.
They're delicious.
Hey, Hickey?
Why don't you bring these two gorgeous ladies another round of pahohoes?
Where you gals from?
We came in from Chicago.
I'm Patty and this is Darlene.
Yeah.
The Windy City.
- I know it well.
- Where are you both from?
Los Angeles.
City of Angels.
I'm Les Price and this is my son, Tim.
He's a little shy.
Just the two of you?
Just the two of us.
Hey.
I hope...
I hope I'm not being too forward if I may ask you something.
- I'm sure you won't be, Les.
- Jesus.
Well, I was just wondering if you're here with anyone.
- We're here alone.
- All alone.
- All alone.
- Can I have the key to the room?
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the room.
Where do you think I'd be going?
You didn't finish your drink.
I don't want the drink.
Just give me the key.
I'll go up with you.
No.
Just stay here, see how it plays out with Patty and Marlene.
That's Darlene.
What's wrong with him, Les?
Troubles in school.
- His mother.
- Okay.
No, no thanks.
You said you were hungry.
I made this for you.
No, my stomach's queasy.
I'm not really hungry anymore.
I really don't know how something like this could happen.
It all seemed to be going so well and now it's just a big mess.
It'll never happen again, I promise.
You're not gonna fire me, are you?
Well, no, I'm not gonna fire you.
Look, I have no idea what this is.
- And another one on my foot.
- Yeah, I don't know what it is either.
Look, Christie, tell me something.
What?
What do you think about Martin?
He's cool.
He's hot.
Yeah, hot.
Well, I know that, but I'm just not sure
I'm at the same place that you are, you know, with everything that's been going on with him.
Forget it.
Sorry I brought it up.
Graham.
Martin's not even staying here.
He's staying at Nina Metro's.
Even though he said she was insane.
That reminds me.
Did you get tickets for tomorrow night at the Greek?
Bryan Metro?
Graham.
You know he doesn't mean as much as you to me.
Come on.
Graham, we're all just having fun, you know?
Like, you take it all so seriously.
Yeah, but you're also sleeping with him, and it's just stressing me out.
What's wrong?
You know I'm on the pill.
Graham?
- Graham?
- Yeah?
You're forgetting something.
What?
We're both sleeping with him.
We're both sleeping with Martin.
And if I'm cool with that, then...
To new beginnings.
So I'm totally psyched.
We're gonna go see Bryan Metro at the Greek tomorrow night.
That is, if Graham remembered to get the tickets.
Yeah, I got the tickets, and stop saying "totally."
- Who'd you get them from?
- Actually, honey, from me.
- Through the studio.
- Good.
I'm glad he didn't go through Martin.
I didn't want to go through Martin, even though he could have gotten us backstage.
Who cares?
He's such a stoner.
He's so into himself.
Him and his totally grody tan and his stupid hair.
Plus, Mom, get this.
He's a male prostitute.
- Why did you direct that statement to me?
- Just mellow out, okay?
I don't even know why we're talking about Martin.
And Mom, Martin's not a male prostitute.
That's on the record.
Why do you think I would care?
Martin is coming to the show with me and Christie, so I hope you get over how, "like, totally grody"
you think he is by tomorrow night.
I hope your girlfriend remembers to wear a shirt by tomorrow night.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the restroom.
And hopefully, when I get back, my lovely children will have finished their conversation about their delightful friends.
Hi, honey.
You're here with her, aren't you?
- Yeah.
- Oh, God.
No, don't.
Sweetie, I know you're pissed.
I understand, I understand.
But I missed you.
I couldn't help it.
- I can't do this.
- You can't do what?
You don't want me anymore?
Sweetie, I want you so bad.
That's not the point, William.
I can't sit here again and listen to you quote numbers about how expensive your fucking divorce is gonna be.
Is it not enough that you've made everyone fucking miserable?
Just stay away.
Please.
You know, I kept the condo.
I haven't given it up yet.
We could meet there tomorrow night.
What do you say?
Or I got the Piper Cub back.
It's at the hangar.
It's ready to go.
We could fly to Vegas and stay at Caesars.
- lt'll be amazing.
- My God, William,
I'm not going to Vegas with you.
Well, at least you're going to be at the Brodkey benefit Friday, right?
We could talk there.
Okay?
Sure.
- Why not?
- Great, honey.
That's what I want to hear.
It's so good to see your face.
We'll figure it out.
It'll be okay.
- Yeah.
- Anyway, I better go.
Okay?
Fuck!
Laura, are we going to the Brodkey benefit on Friday?
Why would we go to the Brodkey benefit on Friday night?
That's TV.
It's not only TV.
And it should be fun.
- Besides that, it's for a good cause.
- It's for a perfume, William.
I don't want to go to the Brodkey benefit Friday night.
What would you like to do instead?
Sleep?
Lay by the pool?
Maybe count your shoes?
Can Daddy borrow $4,000?
What the fuck are you still doing here?
I thought I told you to go.
What?
Are you gonna fucking ignore me?
What the fuck's going on?
What the fuck are you doing, Peter?
What the fuck did you do?
Answer me, God damn it!
Shut your mouth, Jack.
What the fuck?
The kid's gonna bring us some money.
That's the plan.
That's the plan I informed you about.
This is the plan.
Your fucking plan is goddamn holding a kid ransom?
It's not me, Jack.
It's them freaks I met out in West LA.
The people I heard about out in Barstow.
They pay $6,000, $7,000 a pop for a package like that.
You make me fucking sick.
Hey, man, you need to relax.
That's your problem, Jackson.
You don't know how to kick back.
Even when you was a kid out in the desert, and all there was was the sand and the rock and the silence,
you could never accept the fact that that's where you belong, and that's where you're always gonna be.
That was a long time ago.
And we're not in the fucking desert anymore, Uncle Pete.
I think we still are.
- Hello?
- ls Martin there?
I don't know.
Let me check.
Couldn't find him.
Do you know where he might be?
Have you tried his place in Westwood?
- No, I haven't.
- He could be there, or he could be finishing up that music video on the hills.
- ls this Julie?
- Julie?
Yeah.
The girl Martin picked up at 385 North?
With the white rabbit?
We all went back to my place and partied with Graham?
You and Martin disappeared?
Hello?
No.
This isn't her.
I'll call back.
Fuck me.
Cut.
Cut!
What the fuck are you doing, dude?
I can't see shit.
- Hey, Graham.
- Yes, totally fucking excellent.
Perfect timing, dude.
We are so in need of your services.
Wait, hold on a second, Leon.
We really have to get this shot.
The video doesn't make sense without it.
It's a fucking video, Martin.
It doesn't need to make sense.
It just needs to be not lame.
Graham, you got us covered?
- Yeah, man, you're all set.
- Totally excellent.
Hey, hey, hey.
Isn't Christie supposed to be here?
I thought she was supposed to be the star.
I did, too.
But she's a little unreliable.
Maybe you realize that now?
So, where are you staying tonight?
Probably at Nina's, in Malibu.
- Who's Nina?
- Nina.
Nina Metro.
- Bryan Metro's wife?
- Ex- wife.
Christ.
Where are you staying?
Honestly, Martin, I don't know how I feel about the situation anymore.
I think I'm just gonna crash at my mom's.
- Look, I've got eight more shots.
- Yeah.
You're busy.
Can we shoot this, you fucking cokeheads?
Hey, Tim, why don't you get your old man another mai tai?
- Hey.
- What?
Why don't you get your dad and yourself a drink?
- What do you want?
- Mai tai.
Okay.
What are you up to?
Met a girl from San Diego.
Hey, come on.
- Hey, Cheryl.
Nice to see you.
- Hi.
- How are you, sweetie?
- Good.
I just wanted to grab a quick salad or something.
- Do you have anything open?
- Sure.
Let me see.
Excuse me.
Shit!
Fuck you, you fucking asshole!
- Hi.
- Hi.
What would you like, hun?
A garden salad and a glass of water, please.
Okay.
- You're Cheryl Moore, right?
- Yeah.
- I think you're great, honey.
- Thank you.
The piece you did on the anniversary of Sharon Tate.
I remember when that happened.
It was so awful.
- Yeah.
- lt was just so sad.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
All right.
Hey!
Aren't you on the news or something?
- Yes.
- You're Cheryl Moore, right?
- Yeah.
Do you have a light?
- Sure.
Listen...
Can I have your autograph?
'Cause I am, like, your biggest fan.
There you go.
Thanks a lot, Cher.
By the way, we're opening for Bryan Metro at the Greek tonight.
You wanna go?
You know, I really don't think I can.
Got it.
Thanks a lot, Cheryl.
Hello?
What's going on?
How are you?
How did you get this number?
Did Roger give it to you?
Could I just speak to Jamie, please?
Well, he can't right now.
He's...
- He's on the beach with a friend.
- Who?
A friend of his or a friend of yours?
You know, that's just great, Nina.
That's great.
Can we...
Can we just get this over with?
Can I just speak to my kid this time without having to freak out?
Please?
You know you don't even have visitation rights, Bryan.
Just put him on the phone, Nina.
No, I mean, I don't even know why you want me to say this...
Just tell whoever you're fucking to bring my kid out and put him on the phone!
Okay.
No.
You know what, Bryan?
I'm going to hang up now.
Just because I don't have visitation rights does not mean I'm not allowed to talk to my kid.
Now, if you want me to call my lawyers, Nina, I'll call my fucking lawyers!
Fuck your fucking lawyers, Bryan!
- I'll call my fucking lawyers.
- Fuck them!
Fuck, all right, Nina, look, I'm sorry, man.
I'm sorry.
Please, Nina.
I don't mean to shout.
I just...
Bryan, listen to me.
Don't you fucking call me or him ever again.
He's fucking afraid of you!
Fucking afraid of me?
And don't fucking...
You...
What about you, you Medusa?
You fucking Medusa!
- Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
- Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
- Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
- Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
- Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
- Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Good evening, sir.
Surprised?
Do you want to know who I am?
Are you from around here?
Not really.
I'm actually from Nebraska.
A little town near Lincoln.
You had a job at the mall, right?
But the mall closed down, right?
It's all empty now, huh?
Have you been there?
I've been to a mall in Nebraska.
It's all flat.
It's all totally, totally flat.
Come here.
Clear the area.
All of these vehicles need to be moved.
What's going on?
You scared me.
I don't know.
I guess some guy's like threatening to shoot his wife or maybe he shot her or something.
They got the SWAT team out there and everything, man.
- lf I were you, I wouldn't go out there.
- Yeah, I won't.
So you're on the eleventh floor, right?
Yeah, the guy who does the videos visits you all the time.
You mean Martin.
It's actually my girlfriend's place.
- I'm Graham.
- Yeah, I know who you are.
- You want a cigarette?
- Yeah.
It's...
It's kind of a small world, 'cause the guy who raised me out here?
He used to work at the studio your dad runs.
You know, so he was part of the system.
But I guess they had to let him go.
Something happened with some actress or something, and then he kind of had a breakdown, so we went back to Barstow.
But I came back here, 'cause I'm an actor.
I was in a commercial for gum, and I was the boyfriend in a Clearasil commercial.
You know, it's just kind of hard 'cause you can't really make it in this town unless you're really willing to do some awful things.
And, you know, I'm willing.
- Yeah, I guess.
- But I really want to get into video.
That's why I was thinking that Mark guy would be a great contact.
It's Martin.
All right.
Well, thanks for the...
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Yeah.
Hey, where you going?
I've got to drink some juice and then get some sleep.
You sure you don't want to stay?
I could really use the company.
Sorry, I gotta go.
I think something's gonna happen.
Les Price for two at 8:00.
It's actually three.
- I asked Rachel.
- Who's Rachel?
The girl I met on the beach today.
And when were you going to tell me this?
I don't know.
Now, I guess.
I didn't think it would be a problem.
I mean, is it?
Well, I guess there's going to be three of us.
- Hey, Tim.
- Hey, how are you?
Good, thanks.
Rachel, this is my dad, Les Price.
- Hi, Mr. Price.
- Hello, Rachel.
You here in Hawaii on your own?
No, but my parents are in Maui tonight.
So...
You both look nice.
- Thanks, you look great.
- Yes.
You do.
So what did you two do after the beach today?
Well, I watched Tim perfect his hair for two hours, then spend another two hours choosing which shirt he's gonna wear.
Now I understand why.
So did anybody see that Robert Waters is here?
- Who's that?
- Come on, Tim.
Robert Waters.
Star of The Flight Patrol.
It's a television show.
On television.
I don't know.
I guess I just must not watch enough TV.
Yeah, right.
Wait.
You don't know who Robert Waters is?
No, I don't.
- You do, I guess?
- Well, I met him at Reagan's inauguration.
God, I thought everybody knew who Robert Waters is.
I don't.
- Why do you guys care?
- Well, it's a little weird.
- Why?
- He's here with three guys.
The very macho star of Flight Patrol is here with three dudes.
So?
So one of them tried to pick up Tim today.
Me?
When?
At the beach.
Today at the bar.
- That guy?
- Yeah.
That guy.
Look, he was nice.
He was a nice guy.
Yeah, I'm sure he was really nice.
Real nice.
You smoke?
- I told you, Tim.
- What?
- It's bad for you.
- He knows.
I told him last night.
Am I blowing this in your face?
I mean, really?
Is this actually bothering you?
I mean, we're outside.
Look, you just shouldn't smoke, Tim.
Okay.
I'm gonna go finish this cigarette somewhere else, since you two don't like it.
The odds looking pretty good tonight, Dad?
- Tim, stop.
- Let him go.
Well, thank you for dinner, Les.
- Hey.
Hey.
We're not done here.
- No, look, just tell Tim that I'm sorry.
Let's have another drink.
Come on.
You know, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
Don't let him spoil the party.
Come on.
We're not going to another shitty party just because you're fucking the hostess, okay?
And she's married, and her husband's there.
I mean, you'll honestly fuck anybody, right?
I fucked you, dude.
Nice.
Where the fuck was Christie tonight?
Wasn't she supposed to be at the party?
Christ, I guess I forgot to tell you.
She hasn't been feeling too well.
She had to stay in.
- Wait, are you staying at her place?
- No.
She moved in with me and Nina.
- Nina...
Nina Metro, out in the colony?
- Yeah.
- Since when?
- It's been a couple of days.
It's weird, she has these night sweats and swollen glands and this weird rash
- and these little purple bruises...
- Wait, she's sick?
Yeah.
She wanted to get out of the condo and hang at the beach.
She said she'd feel better there.
Martin, I need to know something.
Are you and Christie, like, fucking around?
You guys fuck around when I'm not there?
No.
No.
I wouldn't do that to you.
Holy shit.
You...
Wow.
You really, really like her, don't you?
This isn't just a thing for you.
You actually care about her.
- I need something, Martin.
- You need some fucking ludes.
No, I need something more than this!
Graham, what else is there?
You already have everything.
I need someone to tell me what is good.
Okay?
And I need someone to tell me what's bad.
Because if nobody tells you these things, Martin, then how do you know what's good and what's bad?
And then what happens?
What happens...
What happens then, when nobody tells you these things?
- Can I help you?
- Hi, I'm Dirk.
Who are you?
- Nobody.
What the fuck do you want?
- I'm looking for someone.
- Well, I'm the only one here, so...
- But I have something to pick up here.
I think you've probably got the wrong house.
Where's Peter?
- He's not here.
- Dude, a deal was made.
Now I don't know who you are, but there's something here that now belongs to us.
Look, I don't want any trouble, so I think you should just leave, all right?
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, all right?
- You got the wrong place.
- No.
This is the right place.
The fuck are you looking at?
Look, I told you, Peter's not here.
And I don't know anything about what the fuck you're talking about.
- I'm just really tired.
- This is very important, so think carefully before you answer.
Tell me where the fuck Peter is.
I can't tell you that, 'cause I don't know.
This is simple.
Peter was paid.
We want what we paid for.
- Now where is it?
- I swear to God, I don't know.
Well, you better find out because he will be in a very dark place if we become disappointed, and we're becoming extremely disappointed.
As soon as he gets back, I'll tell him.
I just don't know when that's gonna be.
I'll see you again.
Laura.
I...
I need a shot, and I couldn't find any syringes anywhere.
I mean, with the move and everything.
You don't have any, do you?
I've got one in here.
I saw her, William.
I saw her at the restaurant.
- You saw who?
- Don't make me say her fucking name.
- What are you talking about?
- Just go get dressed.
I'm not gonna have this conversation with you if you're going to lie.
I'm not going to do it.
I'm not going to do it anymore!
If you want to talk to me, you're going to tell me the truth!
- Yeah, I want to talk to you.
- The other night at dinner.
When you came back and you sat down at the table and you said the Brodkeys' benefit.
I know why you want to go.
I know why you want to go.
Do you think I'm an idiot?
- No.
- You know what I do wonder?
If you still have feelings for her, then why are you in this house?
Why are you still in this house?
Are you that selfish?
To think that I would stay here with you while you fucked her?
Is that what you're thinking?
Do you ever think about anybody else but yourself?
Do you ever think about me?
Do you ever think about your children?
- Our children.
- Our children!
You did this for our children?
For Graham?
He's in college.
He deals drugs.
And he thinks you're a joke.
- And Susan?
Susan loathes you!
- That's not true.
Yes, that is very true!
For one time, for one time in your goddamned life, be honest with me, William.
Did you ever love me?
Did you ever love me?
- Tell me, did you ever love me...
- I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
You were afraid you'd be lonely, is that it?
You were afraid you'd have to give me 50% of everything you think you own, is that it?
No.
That's not what this is about.
God.
Oh, God.
I'll go to the benefit with you.
And we'll walk in there and we'll wink and we'll wave and we'll have drinks, and we'll let everybody know we're just fine.
And then you can come back home here and you can pack your things and you can leave.
So, yes, I'll go to the Brodkey benefit with you.
Why would you want to do that?
I want to see her.
Hey!
Where you been?
You weren't in the room.
Tim, what's wrong?
What happened?
What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong.
You want to talk?
Did you just ask me if I want to talk?
Well, yeah.
Yeah.
We could talk.
What?
What are we gonna talk about, Dad?
I don't know.
You tell me.
There's nothing to talk about.
Please...
Please, Tim, come on.
There's nothing to talk about.
Come on.
Give me a chance.
Don't ruin my chances.
You don't have any chances left to ruin, dude.
Come on, Tim, you don't mean that.
There's nothing.
There's nothing.
Just accept it.
It's easier that way.
Just forget it.
There's nothing you can tell me, and there's nothing I'm going to tell you, Dad, that's gonna make any difference.
Some fucking blond kid came by the house.
Yeah, what did he say?
- He was asking me about a package.
- Yeah?
Did you give it to him?
No, I told him we didn't have it.
What?
- What did Dirk say?
- What?
You know his fucking name?
What did Dirk say, Jack?
- He said he'd be back.
- Fuck!
They're gonna kill us!
They're gonna kill us!
Who the fuck are these people?
I think it would be in our best interest if you get your shit and we get the fuck out of here, okay?
I told you.
I told you we shouldn't have come here.
Shut the fuck up, Mary!
Just get your shit and let's get out of here, okay?
No, it's not my fucking problem.
I got a fucking job.
I can't just fucking pack up and move.
You don't know what they're capable of, okay?
You ain't got a goddamn clue.
They're like out of a fucking nightmare.
So get your shit together and let's get the fuck out of here.
Come on, Mary!
What are you doing?
Listen, if we leave the kid here and they find him, this is a more humane way than letting them get their hands on him.
Let me do it.
Let you do what?
- Let you do what?
- I'll handle it.
How are you gonna handle it?
I'm gonna cut his fucking throat.
Get the fucking van ready.
Come on, Mary.
- Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
- Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Clean yourself.
Just clean yourself up.
- Hello?
- Yes, hello, I'm looking for Graham.
- Yeah?
- Graham, it's Nina Metro.
- I'm calling about...
- Who?
We've actually got an emergency with Christie.
I was hoping you could come down.
- Hello, can I help you?
- Hi.
- I'm Graham.
- You're Graham?
Yeah.
She's really sick.
She needs to see a doctor, but she's so stubborn, we can't talk her into it.
- Well, where's her dad?
- He's on location in Italy.
- That's an answer?
- She needs help, Graham.
- Why do you think I can help her?
- Well, aren't you the one that loves her?
What's that gonna fix?
Is that gonna help her?
Hey.
What are you trying to tell me, baby?
What are you saying?
I want...
I want to stay.
But it's getting cold.
But I need more sun.
There's no more sun.
What the fuck?
Tell me something, Roger.
Set your watch back.
There's a time difference.
We're landing in Los Angeles.
It's a city in California.
Anything else you want to know?
You all right, Bryan?
You on edge?
Want a Valium?
Lude?
Gum?
I used to live here, didn't I?
What did he call it?
A talking tomato?
It's a fucking extraterrestrial, Ron.
So you're telling me that he's not gonna sign off until we redesign the talking tomato?
Well, that's bullshit.
Ron, listen, listen to me.
Let me inform you of something, okay?
We don't let 25-year-olds tell us how to make movies.
Listen, I gotta go.
I gotta go, Ron.
Just call...
Ron, call me later, okay?
Fast-acting Power Soap really gets in and blasts stains, leaving your whole wash fresh and clean, with a brightness that people will really notice.
Wow!
That's incredible.
I thought that ketchup stain would never come out of Joe's polo shirt.
Whites simply come out whiter and colors simply come out brighter.
It's the kind of clean that people will really notice and talk about.
How did you lift those coffee stains?
I thought I was gonna have to throw my new pantsuit out.
I blasted it out with Power Soap!
and lets you get on with your day.
President and Mrs. Reagan visited the grieving families and bereaved widows of the more than 200 Marines killed last Sunday in Beirut.
He used the occasion to condemn the actions of what he called
"ruthless terrorists who... "
What time is it?
10:30.
Fuck.
Fuck.
We gotta go.
We're gonna be late.
Right.
That.
I forgot.
Christie, come on.
What are you doing?
I don't feel well.
I don't really want to go.
Neither do I.
Look, I'm not gonna let you...
Good morning.
Look, you want to know why you're not welcome at my house?
Because you're fucked up!
That's not a good enough reason.
That's not even a reason.
That's just one person's opinion.
Look, I don't even want to fucking deal with you right now, do you understand me?
Listen, I'm calling you from a payphone outside of Barstow, and I ain't got any more quarters.
It's simple.
Me and the Indian need a place to hang out for a couple of days.
We have a plan.
I don't want to hear about your fucking plan, Peter.
It doesn't involve you, so stop pissing yourself.
When you lose a child, you can't help but wonder what that child's life would have been like.
You can't help but imagine his future.
A future that now doesn't exist.
But Bruce lived a full life, and there's some comfort in that.
And that he was a good boy, and that he had done all the things he had ever wanted to do.
That the privilege and freedom that was granted to him during his brief time in this world were what made him happy.
I tell myself that I can only cherish one fact.
He had everything.
And now, in conclusion,
I'm going to play Bruce's favorite song.
It meant a lot to him.
-Hi.
-Hi.
So I made the reservations for 8:30.
-Where?
-Spago.
Okay.
Did you tell Susan and Graham?
Well, no.
I thought it was just gonna be the two of us.
William, I'm not really comfortable with that right now.
Okay.
Well, I'll call them and tell them to join us, then.
-Or you could call them.
-No.
No, you should do that.
Okay.
What the fuck was with that favorite song, man?
Bruce had shitty taste in music, but no way.
Personally, I think his mom just liked it.
The real question is, what in the hell are my mom and dad doing by the sushi bar?
I mean, they're actually talking to each other.
At least your mom and dad are talking.
My mom gets to talk to my dad through his lawyers.
Guess what?
I get to go to Hawaii with the asshole.
I can't fucking believe this shit.
-I can't believe you guys are acting this way.
-Acting?
What way, Ray-Ray?
Don't tell me he's gonna cry again.
Fuck!
Face it.
Bruce was a jerk.
Okay?
He's dead.
It's over.
Let's not fucking dwell on it.
I can't believe you guys don't fucking give a shit.
You seem like you don't give a shit.
Look, Raymond, there's nothing we can do, okay?
It happened.
It's over.
It's time to move on.
He's right, Raymond.
It's already been a week.
Okay.
Bruce...
Bruce was a...
A cool guy.
What else can I tell you, Raymond?
I'm sorry it happened.
"Bruce was a cool guy"?
Really, Graham?
Okay, what does that even mean, "Cool"?
Especially after that shit he pulled with Christie.
-Martin, what the fuck are you doing?
-What shit did he pull with Christie?
-Martin.
-Bruce was fucking her behind your back.
What, like, you all knew about this?
Graham, you always say that you're not that serious about Christie.
And it's not like you haven't fucked around.
You know, you're never gonna win Boyfriend of the Year.
-She's my girlfriend, Martin.
-Look, who even knows if it's true?
It's just something Bruce told us and that he bragged about.
Hey, does anybody want to go to a movie?
Sure, what's playing?
I can't believe you guys are gonna go see a fucking movie.
What the...
I can't believe you don't give a shit, man.
-I was there, you asshole.
-Hey, come on!
I watched him fucking bleed to death just like you did, so don't give me this shit about how I don't care.
I had his blood all over my face.
Fuck.
Someone should go talk to him.
Tim, Bruce thought Raymond was an asshole.
He fucking loathed the dude, okay?
And what the fuck does it even matter?
We're having a fucking wake at the Beverly Hilton.
I mean, come on, do you get it?
Come on.
Get up.
Bruce wouldn't want to see you like this.
He was my friend, right?
Yeah.
He was your friend.
Are you lying to me, Graham?
No.
I'm telling you the truth.
How's work?
It's good.
I have a full slate of movies that are testing really high.
-There's one you might really like.
-Yeah?
What's that?
It's a movie about this 12-year-old boy who becomes the president.
The president of what?
The United States.
Sounds better than the one about the talking car.
How's Graham?
Well, you know your brother.
He's a little hard to reach.
But I'm sure he's upset about his friend's death, so, you know, it's tough.
When I saw him at the memorial, he seemed fine, though.
He seemed fine at Bruce's memorial?
Yeah.
So how's Cheryl, by the way?
I'm not seeing Cheryl anymore.
What?
When did this happen?
That's something I wanted to talk to you about, actually.
-You talk to your mom lately?
-We talk.
You know, when she's coherent, which is rarely.
Why?
Well, Mom and I are moving back in together.
We're going to live together again.
She didn't tell me that.
-How do you feel about that?
-Great.
Great.
This is a really good move.
Yeah.
Really good.
Seriously?
I mean, you really think it's great?
Well, to be honest, it hasn't totally hit me that you might actually be serious.
I'm serious.
We're going to be a family again.
Graham and I aren't moving back in, Dad.
We're not gonna be a family.
You and Mom are gonna be a couple again, but we're not gonna be a family.
Martin?
You can't call the house anymore.
Why?
Is there someone here who cares?
You just can't come over here anymore.
-No.
-Are you going to tell me why?
William is moving back in.
Are you telling me he dumped the newscaster chick?
So...
Big Bad William is moving back in.
So the fuck what?
Unless you wanna shell out for a room at the Bel-Air...
No, Martin.
Martin, you don't understand.
We can't do this anymore.
We can't do it.
It's over.
Right.
Just like it was over the last time?
Martin, don't.
Baby.
I see.
Well, could I at least borrow 60 bucks?
I have to pay this guy for these Billy Idol tickets.
And I forgot to go to the Insta-Teller and, you know...
You know, it's just really a massive hassle, so...
What can I do for you, Mr. Metro?
Can you just get these kids out of here, man?
-Hey!
What are you doing?
Come on.
-All right.
Time to go.
No!
Hey, Jackson.
How's it hanging?
What the fuck are you doing here?
I told you I was coming.
What'd you think, it was a joke?
One fucking night.
And that's it.
You understand me?
Jackson, will you chill out, man, and show your Uncle Pete a little love, huh?
Well, where's this fucking Indian friend of yours?
Indian's in the desert.
What the fuck does that even mean, "The Indian's in the desert"?
Indian did some bad stuff.
Decided to stay in Barstow.
He's laying low, if you get my drift.
But Mary's in the van.
-Who's Mary?
-Come on, I'll show you.
Jackson, this is Mary.
Mary?
Mary, this is Jackson.
Is she okay?
Yeah, she's sort of just taking it all in.
She saw some stuff.
Bothered her.
-How old is this girl?
-I don't know.
16. 17.
I never ask.
Lucifer?
What the fuck are you doing with 2 underage kids?
How many times are we gonna go through this?
It does not matter if it was consensual.
I fucked up my hand.
How'd you do it?
Did someone help you?
I did it shaving, man.
Who the fuck cares?
My hand is fucked up.
Just...
Just call a doctor, Roger.
We are meeting Gary Gray, the movie producer.
You know, I don't know if I'm going to be able to make that meeting, Roger.
Look, I'll send the hotel doctor up and then you're gonna pull it together.
And when I knock on your door, you are going to answer it without your cock hanging out of some 14-year-old girl's ass.
Got it?
And you're going to be wearing something with long sleeves.
-Why?
-Multiple choice.
A, you look nice in long sleeves.
B, you have holes in your arms.
C, you have holes in your arms.
Or D, you have holes in your arms.
-C.
-Really?
Yeah?
Graham, it's for you.
-It's Dirk.
-Shit.
Hey, Dirk.
Yeah.
What do you need?
Yeah, I can get that for you.
Okay.
A little business?
Yeah.
And my fucking car's at my mom's.
-Can you give me a ride?
-Can't.
I'm going to Hawaii.
Well, fuck, dude, give me a better excuse than that.
I wish I could.
Thanks.
Aloha.
Can you give me a lift?
Don't look at me, dude.
Bye.
So how're you doing, Tim?
I'm good.
Fine.
How are you?
I'm doing good, I guess.
-You want a drink?
-No, that's all right.
Come on.
Have a drink.
-I'm okay.
-I'm gonna pour you one anyway.
So, what have you been up to?
Kind of a tough thing about that friend of yours dying, huh?
-You want to talk about that?
-What time does the plane leave?
11:00 sharp.
You wanna hear something?
Who's this?
-I think it's Devo.
-Who?
It's a group called Devo.
Great.
I love it.
Yeah.
Hey.
Hey.
I think it's great you could finally get away with your old man, you know?
Your mom said maybe you weren't gonna be able to make it.
-But here you are.
-I'm here.
We're going to Hawaii.
It's gonna be great.
The virus's unknown origin and seeming selectivity is creating fear.
Gays, intravenous drug users and Haitians seem particularly to be at risk.
The virus reacts almost like a contagious form of cancer.
I'm trying to stay positive.
I think in my situation it's very...
And it's where film meets rock and we're all happy.
-Bryan.
-Okay, an idea for a movie.
And the reason we came to Bryan Metro is because people remember how intense that movie turned out about the life of the band.
Holy Christ, man, the 4 of you guys, Sam and Matt and...
-Ed.
His name was Ed.
-Yeah.
Yeah.
That's known as a real tragedy, huh?
A real shame.
Upsetting, too, I bet.
Right?
When your bassist jumps from the roof of the Clift Hotel, I'd say so.
They'd already split up by then, so...
Yeah.
Well, anyways, since that movie about the life of the band turned out to be so cool and so profitable, without exploiting anyone, we were wondering if you'd be pleased and thrilled to star in a movie,
one where you would actually play yourself.
We get so many scripts.
Bryan turned down Amadeus, so we're very fussy.
Well, this movie is basically your typical rock-star-in-outer-space-type thing.
There's this alien creature, this ET.
-ET?
-Extraterrestrial.
Alien.
Yeah.
The ET sabotages Bryan's limo after a gig, and there's a big fiery chase and somehow...
-We haven't quite got that nailed yet...
-Yeah, go on.
You all end up on a planet where Bryan falls in love with a princess.
We're thinking Pat Benatar or a Go-Go for that.
In order to escape the planet, you have to play in this big concert for the emperor,
who's basically this giant tomato.
So it's madcap, right?
-It's not tacky...
-Yes.
and everyone is getting very excited by it.
Bryan?
Bryan.
Bryan?
Thank you so much for coming.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Christie, you know my sister, Susan, right?
-Have you guys met?
-Yeah.
Hi.
Okay, well, I'm gonna get a drink.
-Cool, baby.
You wanna bring me one, too?
-Nice shirt.
Ditto.
Does she always dress like that?
Movies, restaurants and stuff?
-You a little jealous?
-Graham!
Hey, mellow out.
Did you know they were gonna go through with it?
What?
Mom and Dad?
Yeah.
Mom mentioned something when I woke up.
What a scandal, huh?
Oh, my God, you're so stoned.
You're such a stoner.
I can't even talk to you.
I'm really not stoned, okay?
Just mellow out.
-You should talk to him.
-And say what exactly?
I don't know. "Dad, this isn't a good idea.
Don't go through..."
Okay?
All right.
Let's take off, all right?
What do you say?
Graham, do you even care what he did to Mom?
And now he's back and he's just gonna do the same thing again.
Look, I had to take care of her, okay, Graham?
I had to take care of Mom, and I'm not gonna do it again!
Graham.
Graham!
Please.
We have to do something, okay?
If Dad pulls the same shit again, Mom isn't gonna make it.
This will destroy her.
Do you understand?
Cheryl, there's someone on the phone.
-William Sloan.
-Thank you.
-What?
-I called the house and no one answered.
I was hoping it was the wrong number.
Yeah, well, it's not the wrong number.
So why haven't you been home?
Because I've been busy.
I'm filling in for Suzanne Yakomiato.
I really want to see you.
What about Laura, William?
What about her?
What about Laura?
I think I really miss you.
I think I'm making a big mistake.
-Let me go!
-Shut up!
-Mary, go!
-I have no license.
Get in the fucking car and drive.
What do you think?
About what?
What do you think I mean?
Next to us.
Them.
What about them?
Don't you go out with girls?
Pardon me?
Don't you, like, date females?
What are you asking me?
The odds look good.
The odds look pretty good.
Ladies, what are you drinking tonight?
Pahohoes.
Pahohoes?
That sounds intriguing.
They're delicious.
Hey, Hickey?
Why don't you bring these 2 gorgeous ladies another round of pahohoes?
Where you gals from?
We came in from Chicago.
I'm Patty and this is Darlene.
Yeah.
The Windy City.
-I know it well.
-Where are you both from?
Los Angeles.
City of Angels.
I'm Les Price and this is my son, Tim.
He's a little shy.
Just the two of you?
Just the two of us.
Hey.
I hope...
I hope I'm not being too forward if I may ask you something.
-I'm sure you won't be, Les.
-Jesus.
Well, I was just wondering if you're here with anyone.
-We're here alone.
-All alone.
-All alone.
-Can I have the key to the room?
-Where are you going?
-I'm going to the room.
Where do you think I'd be going?
-You didn't finish your drink.
-I don't want the drink.
Just give me the key.
I'll go up with you.
No.
Just stay here, see how it plays out with Patty and Marlene.
That's Darlene.
What's wrong with him, Les?
Troubles in school.
-His mother.
-Okay.
No, no thanks.
You said you were hungry.
I made this for you.
No, my stomach's queasy.
I'm not really hungry anymore.
I really don't know how something like this could happen.
It all seemed to be going so well and now it's just a big mess.
It'll never happen again, I promise.
You're not gonna fire me, are you?
Well, no, I'm not gonna fire you.
Look, I have no idea what this is.
-And another one on my foot.
-Yeah, I don't know what it is either.
Look, Christie, tell me something.
What?
What do you think about Martin?
He's cool.
He's hot.
Yeah, hot.
Well, I know that, but I'm just not sure
I'm at the same place that you are, you know, with everything that's been going on with him.
Forget it.
Sorry I brought it up.
Graham.
Martin's not even staying here.
He's staying at Nina Metro's.
Even though he said she was insane.
That reminds me.
Did you get tickets for tomorrow night at the Greek?
Bryan Metro?
Graham.
You know he doesn't mean as much as you to me.
Come on.
Graham, we're all just having fun, you know?
Like, you take it all so seriously.
Yeah, but you're also sleeping with him, and it's just stressing me out.
What's wrong?
You know I'm on the pill.
Graham?
-Graham?
-Yeah?
You're forgetting something.
What?
We're both sleeping with him.
We're both sleeping with Martin.
And if I'm cool with that, then...
To new beginnings.
So I'm totally psyched.
We're gonna go see Bryan Metro at the Greek tomorrow night.
That is, if Graham remembered to get the tickets.
Yeah, I got the tickets, and stop saying "totally."
-Who'd you get them from?
-Actually, honey, from me.
-Through the studio.
-Good.
I'm glad he didn't go through Martin.
I didn't want to go through Martin, even though he could have gotten us backstage.
Who cares?
He's such a stoner.
He's so into himself.
Him and his totally grody tan and his stupid hair.
Plus, Mom, get this.
He's a male prostitute.
-Why did you direct that statement to me?
-Just mellow out, okay?
I don't even know why we're talking about Martin.
And Mom, Martin's not a male prostitute.
That's on the record.
Why do you think I would care?
Martin is coming to the show with me and Christie, so I hope you get over how, "like, totally grody"
you think he is by tomorrow night.
I hope your girlfriend remembers to wear a shirt by tomorrow night.
-Where are you going?
-I'm going to the restroom.
And hopefully, when I get back, my lovely children will have finished their conversation about their delightful friends.
Hi, honey.
You're here with her, aren't you?
-Yeah.
-Oh, God.
No, don't.
Sweetie, I know you're pissed.
I understand, I understand.
But I missed you.
I couldn't help it.
-I can't do this.
-You can't do what?
You don't want me anymore?
Sweetie, I want you so bad.
That's not the point, William.
I can't sit here again and listen to you quote numbers about how expensive your fucking divorce is gonna be.
Is it not enough that you've made everyone fucking miserable?
Just stay away.
Please.
You know, I kept the condo.
I haven't given it up yet.
We could meet there tomorrow night.
What do you say?
Or I got the Piper Cub back.
It's at the hangar.
It's ready to go.
We could fly to Vegas and stay at Caesars.
-It'll be amazing.
-My God, William,
I'm not going to Vegas with you.
Well, at least you're going to be at the Brodkey benefit Friday, right?
We could talk there.
Okay?
Sure.
-Why not?
-Great, honey.
That's what I want to hear.
It's so good to see your face.
We'll figure it out.
It'll be okay.
-Yeah.
-Anyway, I better go.
Okay?
Fuck!
Laura, are we going to the Brodkey benefit on Friday?
Why would we go to the Brodkey benefit on Friday night?
That's TV.
It's not only TV.
And it should be fun.
-Besides that, it's for a good cause.
-It's for a perfume, William.
I don't want to go to the Brodkey benefit Friday night.
What would you like to do instead?
Sleep?
Lay by the pool?
Maybe count your shoes?
Can Daddy borrow $4,000?
What the fuck are you still doing here?
I thought I told you to go.
What?
Are you gonna fucking ignore me?
What the fuck's going on?
What the fuck are you doing, Peter?
What the fuck did you do?
Answer me, God damn it!
Shut your mouth, Jack.
What the fuck?
The kid's gonna bring us some money.
That's the plan.
That's the plan I informed you about.
This is the plan.
Your fucking plan is goddamn holding a kid ransom?
It's not me, Jack.
It's them freaks I met out in West LA.
The people I heard about out in Barstow.
They pay $6,000, $7,000 a pop for a package like that.
You make me fucking sick.
Hey, man, you need to relax.
That's your problem, Jackson.
You don't know how to kick back.
Even when you was a kid out in the desert, and all there was was the sand and the rock and the silence,
you could never accept the fact that that's where you belong, and that's where you're always gonna be.
That was a long time ago.
And we're not in the fucking desert anymore, Uncle Pete.
I think we still are.
-Hello?
-Is Martin there?
I don't know.
Let me check.
Couldn't find him.
Do you know where he might be?
Have you tried his place in Westwood?
-No, I haven't.
-He could be there, or he could be finishing up that music video on the hills.
-Is this Julie?
-Julie?
Yeah.
The girl Martin picked up at 385 North?
With the white rabbit?
We all went back to my place and partied with Graham?
You and Martin disappeared?
Hello?
No.
This isn't her.
I'll call back.
Fuck me.
Cut.
Cut!
What the fuck are you doing, dude?
I can't see shit.
-Hey, Graham.
-Yes, totally fucking excellent.
Perfect timing, dude.
We are so in need of your services.
Wait, hold on a second, Leon.
We really have to get this shot.
The video doesn't make sense without it.
It's a fucking video, Martin.
It doesn't need to make sense.
It just needs to be not lame.
Graham, you got us covered?
-Yeah, man, you're all set.
-Totally excellent.
Hey, hey, hey.
Isn't Christie supposed to be here?
I thought she was supposed to be the star.
I did, too.
But she's a little unreliable.
Maybe you realize that now?
So, where are you staying tonight?
Probably at Nina's, in Malibu.
-Who's Nina?
-Nina.
Nina Metro.
-Bryan Metro's wife?
-Ex-wife.
Christ.
Where are you staying?
Honestly, Martin, I don't know how I feel about the situation anymore.
I think I'm just gonna crash at my mom's.
-Look, I've got 8 more shots.
-Yeah.
You're busy.
Can we shoot this, you fucking cokeheads?
Hey, Tim, why don't you get your old man another mai tai?
-Hey.
-What?
Why don't you get your dad and yourself a drink?
-What do you want?
-Mai tai.
Okay.
What are you up to?
Met a girl from San Diego.
Hey, come on.
-Hey, Cheryl.
Nice to see you.
-Hi.
-How are you, sweetie?
-Good.
I just wanted to grab a quick salad or something.
-Do you have anything open?
-Sure.
Let me see.
Excuse me.
Shit!
Fuck you, you fucking asshole!
-Hi.
-Hi.
What would you like, hun?
A garden salad and a glass of water, please.
Okay.
-You're Cheryl Moore, right?
-Yeah.
-I think you're great, honey.
-Thank you.
The piece you did on the anniversary of Sharon Tate.
I remember when that happened.
It was so awful.
-Yeah.
-It was just so sad.
-Thank you.
-Yeah.
All right.
Hey!
Aren't you on the news or something?
-Yes.
-You're Cheryl Moore, right?
-Yeah.
Do you have a light?
-Sure.
Listen...
Can I have your autograph?
'Cause I am, like, your biggest fan.
There you go.
Thanks a lot, Cher.
By the way, we're opening for Bryan Metro at the Greek tonight.
You wanna go?
You know, I really don't think I can.
Got it.
Thanks a lot, Cheryl.
Hello?
What's going on?
How are you?
How did you get this number?
Did Roger give it to you?
Could I just speak to Jamie, please?
Well, he can't right now.
He's...
-He's on the beach with a friend.
-Who?
A friend of his or a friend of yours?
You know, that's just great, Nina.
That's great.
Can we...
Can we just get this over with?
Can I just speak to my kid this time without having to freak out?
Please?
You know you don't even have visitation rights, Bryan.
Just put him on the phone, Nina.
No, I mean, I don't even know why you want me to say this...
Just tell whoever you're fucking to bring my kid out and put him on the phone!
Okay.
No.
You know what, Bryan?
I'm going to hang up now.
Just because I don't have visitation rights does not mean I'm not allowed to talk to my kid.
Now, if you want me to call my lawyers, Nina, I'll call my fucking lawyers!
Fuck your fucking lawyers, Bryan!
-I'll call my fucking lawyers.
-Fuck them!
Fuck, all right, Nina, look, I'm sorry, man.
I'm sorry.
Please, Nina.
I don't mean to shout.
I just...
Bryan, listen to me.
Don't you fucking call me or him ever again.
He's fucking afraid of you!
Fucking afraid of me?
And don't fucking...
You...
What about you, you Medusa?
You fucking Medusa!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Good evening, sir.
Surprised?
Do you want to know who I am?
Are you from around here?
Not really.
I'm actually from Nebraska.
A little town near Lincoln.
You had a job at the mall, right?
But the mall closed down, right?
It's all empty now, huh?
Have you been there?
I've been to a mall in Nebraska.
It's all flat.
It's all totally, totally flat.
Come here.
Clear the area.
All of these vehicles need to be moved.
What's going on?
You scared me.
I don't know.
I guess some guy's like threatening to shoot his wife or maybe he shot her or something.
They got the SWAT team out there and everything, man.
-If I were you, I wouldn't go out there.
-Yeah, I won't.
So you're on the 11th floor, right?
Yeah, the guy who does the videos visits you all the time.
You mean Martin.
It's actually my girlfriend's place.
-I'm Graham.
-Yeah, I know who you are.
-You want a cigarette?
-Yeah.
It's...
It's kind of a small world, 'cause the guy who raised me out here?
He used to work at the studio your dad runs.
You know, so he was part of the system.
But I guess they had to let him go.
Something happened with some actress or something, and then he kind of had a breakdown, so we went back to Barstow.
But I came back here, 'cause I'm an actor.
I was in a commercial for gum, and I was the boyfriend in a Clearasil commercial.
You know, it's just kind of hard 'cause you can't really make it in this town unless you're really willing to do some awful things.
And, you know, I'm willing.
-Yeah, I guess.
-But I really want to get into video.
That's why I was thinking that Mark guy would be a great contact.
It's Martin.
All right.
Well, thanks for the...
-Yeah, absolutely.
-Yeah.
Hey, where you going?
I've got to drink some juice and then get some sleep.
You sure you don't want to stay?
I could really use the company.
Sorry, I gotta go.
I think something's gonna happen.
Les Price for 2 at 8:00.
It's actually 3.
-I asked Rachel.
-Who's Rachel?
The girl I met on the beach today.
And when were you going to tell me this?
I don't know.
Now, I guess.
I didn't think it would be a problem.
I mean, is it?
Well, I guess there's going to be 3 of us.
-Hey, Tim.
-Hey, how are you?
Good, thanks.
Rachel, this is my dad, Les Price.
-Hi, Mr. Price.
-Hello, Rachel.
You here in Hawaii on your own?
No, but my parents are in Maui tonight.
So...
You both look nice.
-Thanks, you look great.
-Yes.
You do.
So what did you two do after the beach today?
Well, I watched Tim perfect his hair for 2 hours, then spend another 2 hours choosing which shirt he's gonna wear.
Now I understand why.
So did anybody see that Robert Waters is here?
-Who's that?
-Come on, Tim.
Robert Waters.
Star of The Flight Patrol.
It's a television show.
On television.
I don't know.
I guess I just must not watch enough TV.
Yeah, right.
Wait.
You don't know who Robert Waters is?
No, I don't.
-You do, I guess?
-Well, I met him at Reagan's inauguration.
God, I thought everybody knew who Robert Waters is.
I don't.
-Why do you guys care?
-Well, it's a little weird.
-Why?
-He's here with 3 guys.
The very macho star of Flight Patrol is here with 3 dudes.
So?
So one of them tried to pick up Tim today.
Me?
When?
At the beach.
Today at the bar.
-That guy?
-Yeah.
That guy.
Look, he was nice.
He was a nice guy.
Yeah, I'm sure he was really nice.
Real nice.
You smoke?
-I told you, Tim.
-What?
-It's bad for you.
-He knows.
I told him last night.
Am I blowing this in your face?
I mean, really?
Is this actually bothering you?
I mean, we're outside.
Look, you just shouldn't smoke, Tim.
Okay.
I'm gonna go finish this cigarette somewhere else, since you two don't like it.
The odds looking pretty good tonight, Dad?
-Tim, stop.
-Let him go.
Well, thank you for dinner, Les.
-Hey.
Hey.
We're not done here.
-No, look, just tell Tim that I'm sorry.
Let's have another drink.
Come on.
You know, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
Don't let him spoil the party.
Come on.
We're not going to another shitty party just because you're fucking the hostess, okay?
And she's married, and her husband's there.
I mean, you'll honestly fuck anybody, right?
I fucked you, dude.
Nice.
Where the fuck was Christie tonight?
Wasn't she supposed to be at the party?
Christ, I guess I forgot to tell you.
She hasn't been feeling too well.
She had to stay in.
-Wait, are you staying at her place?
-No.
She moved in with me and Nina.
-Nina...
Nina Metro, out in the colony?
-Yeah.
-Since when?
-It's been a couple of days.
It's weird, she has these night sweats and swollen glands and this weird rash
-and these little purple bruises...
-Wait, she's sick?
Yeah.
She wanted to get out of the condo and hang at the beach.
She said she'd feel better there.
Martin, I need to know something.
Are you and Christie, like, fucking around?
You guys fuck around when I'm not there?
No.
No.
I wouldn't do that to you.
Holy shit.
You...
Wow.
You really, really like her, don't you?
This isn't just a thing for you.
You actually care about her.
-I need something, Martin.
-You need some fucking ludes.
No, I need something more than this!
Graham, what else is there?
You already have everything.
I need someone to tell me what is good.
Okay?
And I need someone to tell me what's bad.
Because if nobody tells you these things, Martin, then how do you know what's good and what's bad?
And then what happens?
What happens...
What happens then, when nobody tells you these things?
-Can I help you?
-Hi, I'm Dirk.
Who are you?
-Nobody.
What the fuck do you want?
-I'm looking for someone.
-Well, I'm the only one here, so...
-But I have something to pick up here.
I think you've probably got the wrong house.
Where's Peter?
-He's not here.
-Dude, a deal was made.
Now I don't know who you are, but there's something here that now belongs to us.
Look, I don't want any trouble, so I think you should just leave, all right?
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, all right?
-You got the wrong place.
-No.
This is the right place.
The fuck are you looking at?
Look, I told you, Peter's not here.
And I don't know anything about what the fuck you're talking about.
-I'm just really tired.
-This is very important, so think carefully before you answer.
-Tell me where the fuck Peter is.
-I can't tell you that, 'cause I don't know.
This is simple.
Peter was paid.
We want what we paid for.
-Now where is it?
-I swear to God, I don't know.
Well, you better find out because he will be in a very dark place if we become disappointed, and we're becoming extremely disappointed.
As soon as he gets back, I'll tell him.
I just don't know when that's gonna be.
I'll see you again.
Laura.
I...
I need a shot, and I couldn't find any syringes anywhere.
I mean, with the move and everything.
You don't have any, do you?
I've got one in here.
I saw her, William.
I saw her at the restaurant.
-You saw who?
-Don't make me say her fucking name.
-What are you talking about?
-Just go get dressed.
I'm not gonna have this conversation with you if you're going to lie.
I'm not going to do it.
I'm not going to do it anymore!
If you want to talk to me, you're going to tell me the truth!
-Yeah, I want to talk to you.
-The other night at dinner.
When you came back and you sat down at the table and you said the Brodkeys' benefit.
I know why you want to go.
I know why you want to go.
Do you think I'm an idiot?
-No.
-You know what I do wonder?
If you still have feelings for her, then why are you in this house?
Why are you still in this house?
Are you that selfish?
To think that I would stay here with you while you fucked her?
Is that what you're thinking?
Do you ever think about anybody else but yourself?
Do you ever think about me?
Do you ever think about your children?
-Our children.
-Our children!
You did this for our children?
For Graham?
He's in college.
He deals drugs.
And he thinks you're a joke.
-And Susan?
Susan loathes you!
-That's not true.
Yes, that is very true!
For one time, for one time in your goddamned life, be honest with me, William.
Did you ever love me?
Did you ever love me?
-Tell me, did you ever love me...
-I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
You were afraid you'd be lonely, is that it?
You were afraid you'd have to give me 50% of everything you think you own, is that it?
No.
That's not what this is about.
God.
Oh, God.
I'll go to the benefit with you.
And we'll walk in there and we'll wink and we'll wave and we'll have drinks, and we'll let everybody know we're just fine.
And then you can come back home here and you can pack your things and you can leave.
So, yes, I'll go to the Brodkey benefit with you.
Why would you want to do that?
I want to see her.
Hey!
Where you been?
You weren't in the room.
Tim, what's wrong?
What happened?
What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong.
You want to talk?
Did you just ask me if I want to talk?
Well, yeah.
Yeah.
We could talk.
What?
What are we gonna talk about, Dad?
I don't know.
You tell me.
There's nothing to talk about.
Please...
Please, Tim, come on.
There's nothing to talk about.
Come on.
Give me a chance.
Don't ruin my chances.
You don't have any chances left to ruin, dude.
Come on, Tim, you don't mean that.
There's nothing.
There's nothing.
Just accept it.
It's easier that way.
Just forget it.
There's nothing you can tell me, and there's nothing I'm going to tell you, Dad, that's gonna make any difference.
Some fucking blond kid came by the house.
Yeah, what did he say?
-He was asking me about a package.
-Yeah?
Did you give it to him?
No, I told him we didn't have it.
What?
-What did Dirk say?
-What?
You know his fucking name?
What did Dirk say, Jack?
-He said he'd be back.
-Fuck!
They're gonna kill us!
They're gonna kill us!
Who the fuck are these people?
I think it would be in our best interest if you get your shit and we get the fuck out of here, okay?
I told you.
I told you we shouldn't have come here.
Shut the fuck up, Mary!
Just get your shit and let's get out of here, okay?
No, it's not my fucking problem.
I got a fucking job.
I can't just fucking pack up and move.
You don't know what they're capable of, okay?
You ain't got a goddamn clue.
They're like out of a fucking nightmare.
So get your shit together and let's get the fuck out of here.
Come on, Mary!
What are you doing?
Listen, if we leave the kid here and they find him, this is a more humane way than letting them get their hands on him.
Let me do it.
Let you do what?
-Let you do what?
-I'll handle it.
How are you gonna handle it?
I'm gonna cut his fucking throat.
Get the fucking van ready.
Come on, Mary.
-Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
-Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Clean yourself.
Just clean yourself up.
-Hello?
-Yes, hello, I'm looking for Graham.
-Yeah?
-Graham, it's Nina Metro.
-I'm calling about...
-Who?
We've actually got an emergency with Christie.
I was hoping you could come down.
-Hello, can I help you?
-Hi.
-I'm Graham.
-You're Graham?
Yeah.
She's really sick.
She needs to see a doctor, but she's so stubborn, we can't talk her into it.
-Well, where's her dad?
-He's on location in Italy.
-That's an answer?
-She needs help, Graham.
-Why do you think I can help her?
-Well, aren't you the one that loves her?
What's that gonna fix?
Is that gonna help her?
Hey.
What are you trying to tell me, baby?
What are you saying?
I want...
I want to stay.
But it's getting cold.
But I need more sun.
There's no more sun.
What the fuck?
Tell me something, Roger.
Set your watch back.
There's a time difference.
We're landing in Los Angeles.
It's a city in California.
Anything else you want to know?
You all right, Bryan?
You on edge?
Want a Valium?
Lude?
Gum?
I used to live here, didn't I?
What did he call it?
A talking tomato?
It's a fucking extraterrestrial, Ron.
So you're telling me that he's not gonna sign off until we redesign the talking tomato?
Well, that's bullshit.
Ron, listen, listen to me.
Let me inform you of something, okay?
We don't let 25-year-olds tell us how to make movies.
Listen, I gotta go.
I gotta go, Ron.
Just call...
Ron, call me later, okay?
Fast-acting Power Soap really gets in and blasts stains,
leaving your whole wash fresh and clean, with a brightness that people will really notice.
Wow!
That's incredible.
I thought that ketchup stain would never come out of Joe's polo shirt.
Whites simply come out whiter and colors simply come out brighter.
It's the kind of clean that people will really notice and talk about.
How did you lift those coffee stains?
I thought I was gonna have to throw my new pantsuit out.
I blasted it out with Power Soap!
...and lets you get on with your day.
President and Mrs. Reagan visited the grieving families and bereaved widows of the more than 200 Marines killed last Sunday in Beirut.
He used the occasion to condemn the actions of what he called
"ruthless terrorists who... "
What time is it?
1 0:30.
Fuck.
Fuck.
We gotta go.
We're gonna be late.
Right.
That.
I forgot.
Christie, come on.
What are you doing?
I don't feel well.
I don't really want to go.
Neither do I.
Look, I'm not gonna let you...
Good morning.
Look, you want to know why you're not welcome at my house?
Because you're fucked up!
That's not a good enough reason.
That's not even a reason.
That's just one person's opinion.
Look, I don't even want to fucking deal with you right now, do you understand me?
Listen, I'm calling you from a payphone outside of Barstow, and I ain't got any more quarters.
It's simple.
Me and the Indian need a place to hang out for a couple of days.
We have a plan.
I don't want to hear about your fucking plan, Peter.
It doesn't involve you, so stop pissing yourself.
When you lose a child, you can't help but wonder what that child's life would have been like.
You can't help but imagine his future.
A future that now doesn't exist.
But Bruce lived a full life, and there's some comfort in that.
And that he was a good boy, and that he had done all the things he had ever wanted to do.
That the privilege and freedom that was granted to him during his brief time in this world were what made him happy.
I tell myself that I can only cherish one fact.
He had everything.
And now, in conclusion,
I'm going to play Bruce's favorite song.
It meant a lot to him.
-Hi.
-Hi.
So I made the reservations for 8:30.
-Where?
-Spago.
Okay.
Did you tell Susan and Graham?
Well, no.
I thought it was just gonna be the two of us.
William, I'm not really comfortable with that right now.
Okay.
Well, I'll call them and tell them to join us, then.
-Or you could call them.
-No.
No, you should do that.
Okay.
What the fuck was with that favorite song, man?
Bruce had shitty taste in music, but no way.
Personally, I think his mom just liked it.
The real question is, what in the hell are my mom and dad doing by the sushi bar?
I mean, they're actually talking to each other.
At least your mom and dad are talking.
My mom gets to talk to my dad through his lawyers.
Guess what?
I get to go to Hawaii with the asshole.
I can't fucking believe this shit.
-I can't believe you guys are acting this way.
-Acting?
What way, Ray-Ray?
Don't tell me he's gonna cry again.
Fuck!
Face it.
Bruce was a jerk.
Okay?
He's dead.
It's over.
Let's not fucking dwell on it.
I can't believe you guys don't fucking give a shit.
You seem like you don't give a shit.
Look, Raymond, there's nothing we can do, okay?
It happened.
It's over.
It's time to move on.
He's right, Raymond.
It's already been a week.
Okay.
Bruce...
Bruce was a...
A cool guy.
What else can I tell you, Raymond?
I'm sorry it happened.
"Bruce was a cool guy"?
Really, Graham?
Okay, what does that even mean, "Cool"?
Especially after that shit he pulled with Christie.
-Martin, what the fuck are you doing?
-What shit did he pull with Christie?
-Martin.
-Bruce was fucking her behind your back.
What, like, you all knew about this?
Graham, you always say that you're not that serious about Christie.
And it's not like you haven't fucked around.
You know, you're never gonna win Boyfriend of the Year.
-She's my girlfriend, Martin.
-Look, who even knows if it's true?
It's just something Bruce told us and that he bragged about.
Hey, does anybody want to go to a movie?
Sure, what's playing?
I can't believe you guys are gonna go see a fucking movie.
What the...
I can't believe you don't give a shit, man.
-I was there, you asshole.
-Hey, come on!
I watched him fucking bleed to death just like you did, so don't give me this shit about how I don't care.
I had his blood all over my face.
Fuck.
Someone should go talk to him.
Tim, Bruce thought Raymond was an asshole.
He fucking loathed the dude, okay?
And what the fuck does it even matter?
We're having a fucking wake at the Beverly Hilton.
I mean, come on, do you get it?
Come on.
Get up.
Bruce wouldn't want to see you like this.
He was my friend, right?
Yeah.
He was your friend.
Are you lying to me, Graham?
No.
I'm telling you the truth.
How's work?
It's good.
I have a full slate of movies that are testing really high.
-There's one you might really like.
-Yeah?
What's that?
It's a movie about this 12-year-old boy who becomes the president.
The president of what?
The United States.
Sounds better than the one about the talking car.
How's Graham?
Well, you know your brother.
He's a little hard to reach.
But I'm sure he's upset about his friend's death, so, you know, it's tough.
When I saw him at the memorial, he seemed fine, though.
He seemed fine at Bruce's memorial?
Yeah.
So how's Cheryl, by the way?
I'm not seeing Cheryl anymore.
What?
When did this happen?
That's something I wanted to talk to you about, actually.
-You talk to your mom lately?
-We talk.
You know, when she's coherent, which is rarely.
Why?
Well, Mom and I are moving back in together.
We're going to live together again.
She didn't tell me that.
-How do you feel about that?
-Great.
Great.
This is a really good move.
Yeah.
Really good.
Seriously?
I mean, you really think it's great?
Well, to be honest, it hasn't totally hit me that you might actually be serious.
I'm serious.
We're going to be a family again.
Graham and I aren't moving back in, Dad.
We're not gonna be a family.
You and Mom are gonna be a couple again, but we're not gonna be a family.
Martin?
You can't call the house anymore.
Why?
Is there someone here who cares?
You just can't come over here anymore.
-No.
-Are you going to tell me why?
William is moving back in.
Are you telling me he dumped the newscaster chick?
So...
Big Bad William is moving back in.
So the fuck what?
Unless you wanna shell out for a room at the Bel-Air...
No, Martin.
Martin, you don't understand.
We can't do this anymore.
We can't do it.
It's over.
Right.
Just like it was over the last time?
Martin, don't.
Baby.
I see.
Well, could I at least borrow 60 bucks?
I have to pay this guy for these Billy Idol tickets.
And I forgot to go to the lnsta-Teller and, you know...
You know, it's just really a massive hassle, so...
What can I do for you, Mr. Metro?
Can you just get these kids out of here, man?
-Hey!
What are you doing?
Come on.
-All right.
Time to go.
No!
Hey, Jackson.
How's it hanging?
What the fuck are you doing here?
I told you I was coming.
What'd you think, it was a joke?
One fucking night.
And that's it.
You understand me?
Jackson, will you chill out, man, and show your Uncle Pete a little love, huh?
Well, where's this fucking indian friend of yours?
Indian's in the desert.
What the fuck does that even mean, "The Indian's in the desert"?
Indian did some bad stuff.
Decided to stay in Barstow.
He's laying low, if you get my drift.
But Mary's in the van.
-Who's Mary?
-Come on, I'll show you.
Jackson, this is Mary.
Mary?
Mary, this is Jackson.
Is she okay?
Yeah, she's sort of just taking it all in.
She saw some stuff.
Bothered her.
-How old is this girl?
-I don't know.
Sixteen.
Seventeen.
I never ask.
Lucifer?
What the fuck are you doing with two underage kids?
How many times are we gonna go through this?
It does not matter if it was consensual.
I fucked up my hand.
How'd you do it?
Did someone help you?
I did it shaving, man.
Who the fuck cares?
My hand is fucked up.
Just...
Just call a doctor, Roger.
We are meeting Gary Gray, the movie producer.
You know, I don't know if I'm going to be able to make that meeting, Roger.
Look, I'll send the hotel doctor up and then you're gonna pull it together.
And when I knock on your door, you are going to answer it without your cock hanging out of some 14-year-old girl's ass.
Got it?
And you're going to be wearing something with long sleeves.
-Why?
-Multiple choice.
A, you look nice in long sleeves.
B, you have holes in your arms.
C, you have holes in your arms.
Or D, you have holes in your arms.
-C.
-Really?
Yeah?
Graham, it's for you.
-It's Dirk.
-Shit.
Hey, Dirk.
Yeah.
What do you need?
Yeah, I can get that for you.
Okay.
A little business?
Yeah.
And my fucking car's at my mom's.
-Can you give me a ride?
-Can't.
I'm going to Hawaii.
Well, fuck, dude, give me a better excuse than that.
I wish I could.
Thanks.
Aloha.
Can you give me a lift?
Don't look at me, dude.
Bye.
So how're you doing, Tim?
I'm good.
Fine.
How are you?
I'm doing good, I guess.
-You want a drink?
-No, that's all right.
Come on.
Have a drink.
-I'm okay.
-I'm gonna pour you one anyway.
So, what have you been up to?
Kind of a tough thing about that friend of yours dying, huh?
-You want to talk about that?
-What time does the plane leave?
11:00 sharp.
You wanna hear something?
Who's this?
-I think it's Devo.
-Who?
It's a group called Devo.
Great.
I love it.
Yeah.
Hey.
Hey.
I think it's great you could finally get away with your old man, you know?
Your mom said maybe you weren't gonna be able to make it.
-But here you are.
-I'm here.
We're going to Hawaii.
It's gonna be great.
The virus's unknown origin and seeming selectivity is creating fear.
Gays, intravenous drug users and Haitians seem particularly to be at risk.
The virus reacts almost like a contagious form of cancer.
I'm trying to stay positive.
I think in my situation it's very...
And it's where film meets rock and we're all happy.
-Bryan.
-Okay, an idea for a movie.
And the reason we came to Bryan Metro is because people remember how intense that movie turned out about the life of the band.
Holy Christ, man, the four of you guys, Sam and Matt and...
-Ed.
His name was Ed.
-Yeah.
Yeah.
That's known as a real tragedy, huh?
A real shame.
Upsetting, too, I bet.
Right?
When your bassist jumps from the roof of the Clift Hotel, I'd say so.
They'd already split up by then, so...
Yeah.
Well, anyways, since that movie about the life of the band turned out to be so cool and so profitable, without exploiting anyone, we were wondering if you'd be pleased and thrilled to star in a movie,
one where you would actually play yourself.
We get so many scripts.
Bryan turned down Amadeus, so we're very fussy.
Well, this movie is basically your typical rock-star-in-outer-space-type thing.
There's this alien creature, this ET.
-ET?
-Extraterrestrial.
Alien.
Yeah.
The ET sabotages Bryan's limo after a gig, and there's a big fiery chase and somehow...
-We haven't quite got that nailed yet...
-Yeah, go on.
You all end up on a planet where Bryan falls in love with a princess.
We're thinking Pat Benatar or a Go-Go for that.
In order to escape the planet, you have to play in this big concert for the emperor,
who's basically this giant tomato.
So it's madcap, right?
-It's not tacky...
-Yes.
...and everyone is getting very excited by it.
Bryan?
Bryan.
Bryan?
Thank you so much for coming.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Christie, you know my sister, Susan, right?
-Have you guys met?
-Yeah.
Hi.
Okay, well, I'm gonna get a drink.
-Cool, baby.
You wanna bring me one, too?
-Nice shirt.
Ditto.
Does she always dress like that?
Movies, restaurants and stuff?
-You a little jealous?
-Graham!
Hey, mellow out.
Did you know they were gonna go through with it?
What?
Mom and Dad?
Yeah.
Mom mentioned something when I woke up.
What a scandal, huh?
Oh, my God, you're so stoned.
You're such a stoner.
I can't even talk to you.
I'm really not stoned, okay?
Just mellow out.
-You should talk to him.
-And say what exactly?
I don't know. "Dad, this isn't a good idea.
Don't go through..."
Okay?
All right.
Let's take off, all right?
What do you say?
Graham, do you even care what he did to Mom?
And now he's back and he's just gonna do the same thing again.
Look, I had to take care of her, okay, Graham?
I had to take care of Mom, and I'm not gonna do it again!
Graham.
Graham!
Please.
We have to do something, okay?
If Dad pulls the same shit again, Mom isn't gonna make it.
This will destroy her.
Do you understand?
Cheryl, there's someone on the phone.
-William Sloan.
-Thank you.
-What?
-I called the house and no one answered.
I was hoping it was the wrong number.
Yeah, well, it's not the wrong number.
So why haven't you been home?
Because I've been busy.
I'm filling in for Suzanne Yakomiato.
I really want to see you.
What about Laura, William?
What about her?
What about Laura?
I think I really miss you.
I think I'm making a big mistake.
-Let me go!
-Shut up!
-Mary, go!
-I have no license.
Get in the fucking car and drive.
What do you think?
About what?
What do you think I mean?
Next to us.
Them.
What about them?
Don't you go out with girls?
Pardon me?
Don't you, like, date females?
What are you asking me?
The odds look good.
The odds look pretty good.
Ladies, what are you drinking tonight?
Pahohoes.
Pahohoes?
That sounds intriguing.
They're delicious.
Hey, Hickey?
Why don't you bring these two gorgeous ladies another round of pahohoes?
Where you gals from?
We came in from Chicago.
I'm Patty and this is Darlene.
Yeah.
The Windy City.
-I know it well.
-Where are you both from?
Los Angeles.
City of Angels.
I'm Les Price and this is my son, Tim.
He's a little shy.
Just the two of you?
Just the two of us.
Hey.
I hope...
I hope I'm not being too forward if I may ask you something.
-I'm sure you won't be, Les.
-Jesus.
Well, I was just wondering if you're here with anyone.
-We're here alone.
-All alone.
-All alone.
-Can I have the key to the room?
-Where are you going?
-I'm going to the room.
Where do you think I'd be going?
-You didn't finish your drink.
-I don't want the drink.
Just give me the key.
I'll go up with you.
No.
Just stay here, see how it plays out with Patty and Marlene.
That's Darlene.
What's wrong with him, Les?
Troubles in school.
-His mother.
-Okay.
No, no thanks.
You said you were hungry.
I made this for you.
No, my stomach's queasy.
I'm not really hungry anymore.
I really don't know how something like this could happen.
It all seemed to be going so well and now it's just a big mess.
It'll never happen again, I promise.
You're not gonna fire me, are you?
Well, no, I'm not gonna fire you.
Look, I have no idea what this is.
-And another one on my foot.
-Yeah, I don't know what it is either.
Look, Christie, tell me something.
What?
What do you think about Martin?
He's cool.
He's hot.
Yeah, hot.
Well, I know that, but I'm just not sure
I'm at the same place that you are, you know, with everything that's been going on with him.
Forget it.
Sorry I brought it up.
Graham.
Martin's not even staying here.
He's staying at Nina Metro's.
Even though he said she was insane.
That reminds me.
Did you get tickets for tomorrow night at the Greek?
Bryan Metro?
Graham.
You know he doesn't mean as much as you to me.
Come on.
Graham, we're all just having fun, you know?
Like, you take it all so seriously.
Yeah, but you're also sleeping with him, and it's just stressing me out.
What's wrong?
You know I'm on the pill.
Graham?
-Graham?
-Yeah?
You're forgetting something.
What?
We're both sleeping with him.
We're both sleeping with Martin.
And if I'm cool with that, then...
To new beginnings.
So I'm totally psyched.
We're gonna go see Bryan Metro at the Greek tomorrow night.
That is, if Graham remembered to get the tickets.
Yeah, I got the tickets, and stop saying "totally."
-Who'd you get them from?
-Actually, honey, from me.
-Through the studio.
-Good.
I'm glad he didn't go through Martin.
I didn't want to go through Martin, even though he could have gotten us backstage.
Who cares?
He's such a stoner.
He's so into himself.
Him and his totally grody tan and his stupid hair.
Plus, Mom, get this.
He's a male prostitute.
-Why did you direct that statement to me?
-Just mellow out, okay?
I don't even know why we're talking about Martin.
And Mom, Martin's not a male prostitute.
That's on the record.
Why do you think I would care?
Martin is coming to the show with me and Christie, so I hope you get over how, "like, totally grody"
you think he is by tomorrow night.
I hope your girlfriend remembers to wear a shirt by tomorrow night.
-Where are you going?
-I'm going to the restroom.
And hopefully, when I get back, my lovely children will have finished their conversation about their delightful friends.
Hi, honey.
You're here with her, aren't you?
-Yeah.
-Oh, God.
No, don't.
Sweetie, I know you're pissed.
I understand, I understand.
But I missed you.
I couldn't help it.
-I can't do this.
-You can't do what?
You don't want me anymore?
Sweetie, I want you so bad.
That's not the point, William.
I can't sit here again and listen to you quote numbers about how expensive your fucking divorce is gonna be.
Is it not enough that you've made everyone fucking miserable?
Just stay away.
Please.
You know, I kept the condo.
I haven't given it up yet.
We could meet there tomorrow night.
What do you say?
Or I got the Piper Cub back.
It's at the hangar.
It's ready to go.
We could fly to Vegas and stay at Caesars.
-lt'll be amazing.
-My God, William,
I'm not going to Vegas with you.
Well, at least you're going to be at the Brodkey benefit Friday, right?
We could talk there.
Okay?
Sure.
-Why not?
-Great, honey.
That's what I want to hear.
It's so good to see your face.
We'll figure it out.
It'll be okay.
-Yeah.
-Anyway, I better go.
Okay?
Fuck!
Laura, are we going to the Brodkey benefit on Friday?
Why would we go to the Brodkey benefit on Friday night?
That's TV.
It's not only TV.
And it should be fun.
-Besides that, it's for a good cause.
-It's for a perfume, William.
I don't want to go to the Brodkey benefit Friday night.
What would you like to do instead?
Sleep?
Lay by the pool?
Maybe count your shoes?
Can Daddy borrow $4,000?
What the fuck are you still doing here?
I thought I told you to go.
What?
Are you gonna fucking ignore me?
What the fuck's going on?
What the fuck are you doing, Peter?
What the fuck did you do?
Answer me, God damn it!
Shut your mouth, Jack.
What the fuck?
The kid's gonna bring us some money.
That's the plan.
That's the plan I informed you about.
This is the plan.
Your fucking plan is goddamn holding a kid ransom?
It's not me, Jack.
It's them freaks I met out in West LA.
The people I heard about out in Barstow.
They pay $6,000, $7,000 a pop for a package like that.
You make me fucking sick.
Hey, man, you need to relax.
That's your problem, Jackson.
You don't know how to kick back.
Even when you was a kid out in the desert, and all there was was the sand and the rock and the silence,
you could never accept the fact that that's where you belong, and that's where you're always gonna be.
That was a long time ago.
And we're not in the fucking desert anymore, Uncle Pete.
I think we still are.
-Hello?
-ls Martin there?
I don't know.
Let me check.
Couldn't find him.
Do you know where he might be?
Have you tried his place in Westwood?
-No, I haven't.
-He could be there, or he could be finishing up that music video on the hills.
-ls this Julie?
-Julie?
Yeah.
The girl Martin picked up at 385 North?
With the white rabbit?
We all went back to my place and partied with Graham?
You and Martin disappeared?
Hello?
No.
This isn't her.
I'll call back.
Fuck me.
Cut.
Cut!
What the fuck are you doing, dude?
I can't see shit.
-Hey, Graham.
-Yes, totally fucking excellent.
Perfect timing, dude.
We are so in need of your services.
Wait, hold on a second, Leon.
We really have to get this shot.
The video doesn't make sense without it.
It's a fucking video, Martin.
It doesn't need to make sense.
It just needs to be not lame.
Graham, you got us covered?
-Yeah, man, you're all set.
-Totally excellent.
Hey, hey, hey.
Isn't Christie supposed to be here?
I thought she was supposed to be the star.
I did, too.
But she's a little unreliable.
Maybe you realize that now?
So, where are you staying tonight?
Probably at Nina's, in Malibu.
-Who's Nina?
-Nina.
Nina Metro.
-Bryan Metro's wife?
-Ex-wife.
Christ.
Where are you staying?
Honestly, Martin, I don't know how I feel about the situation anymore.
I think I'm just gonna crash at my mom's.
-Look, I've got eight more shots.
-Yeah.
You're busy.
Can we shoot this, you fucking cokeheads?
Hey, Tim, why don't you get your old man another mai tai?
-Hey.
-What?
Why don't you get your dad and yourself a drink?
-What do you want?
-Mai tai.
Okay.
What are you up to?
Met a girl from San Diego.
Hey, come on.
-Hey, Cheryl.
Nice to see you.
-Hi.
-How are you, sweetie?
-Good.
I just wanted to grab a quick salad or something.
-Do you have anything open?
-Sure.
Let me see.
Excuse me.
Shit!
Fuck you, you fucking asshole!
-Hi.
-Hi.
What would you like, hun?
A garden salad and a glass of water, please.
Okay.
-You're Cheryl Moore, right?
-Yeah.
-I think you're great, honey.
-Thank you.
The piece you did on the anniversary of Sharon Tate.
I remember when that happened.
It was so awful.
-Yeah.
-lt was just so sad.
-Thank you.
-Yeah.
All right.
Hey!
Aren't you on the news or something?
-Yes.
-You're Cheryl Moore, right?
-Yeah.
Do you have a light?
-Sure.
Listen...
Can I have your autograph?
'Cause I am, like, your biggest fan.
There you go.
Thanks a lot, Cher.
By the way, we're opening for Bryan Metro at the Greek tonight.
You wanna go?
You know, I really don't think I can.
Got it.
Thanks a lot, Cheryl.
Hello?
What's going on?
How are you?
How did you get this number?
Did Roger give it to you?
Could I just speak to Jamie, please?
Well, he can't right now.
He's...
-He's on the beach with a friend.
-Who?
A friend of his or a friend of yours?
You know, that's just great, Nina.
That's great.
Can we...
Can we just get this over with?
Can I just speak to my kid this time without having to freak out?
Please?
You know you don't even have visitation rights, Bryan.
Just put him on the phone, Nina.
No, I mean, I don't even know why you want me to say this...
Just tell whoever you're fucking to bring my kid out and put him on the phone!
Okay.
No.
You know what, Bryan?
I'm going to hang up now.
Just because I don't have visitation rights does not mean I'm not allowed to talk to my kid.
Now, if you want me to call my lawyers, Nina, I'll call my fucking lawyers!
Fuck your fucking lawyers, Bryan!
-I'll call my fucking lawyers.
-Fuck them!
Fuck, all right, Nina, look, I'm sorry, man.
I'm sorry.
Please, Nina.
I don't mean to shout.
I just...
Bryan, listen to me.
Don't you fucking call me or him ever again.
He's fucking afraid of you!
Fucking afraid of me?
And don't fucking...
You...
What about you, you Medusa?
You fucking Medusa!
-Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
-Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
-Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
-Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
-Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
-Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Good evening, sir.
Surprised?
Do you want to know who I am?
Are you from around here?
Not really.
I'm actually from Nebraska.
A little town near Lincoln.
You had a job at the mall, right?
But the mall closed down, right?
It's all empty now, huh?
Have you been there?
I've been to a mall in Nebraska.
It's all flat.
It's all totally, totally flat.
Come here.
Clear the area.
All of these vehicles need to be moved.
What's going on?
You scared me.
I don't know.
I guess some guy's like threatening to shoot his wife or maybe he shot her or something.
They got the SWAT team out there and everything, man.
-lf I were you, I wouldn't go out there.
-Yeah, I won't.
So you're on the eleventh floor, right?
Yeah, the guy who does the videos visits you all the time.
You mean Martin.
It's actually my girlfriend's place.
-I'm Graham.
-Yeah, I know who you are.
-You want a cigarette?
-Yeah.
It's...
It's kind of a small world, 'cause the guy who raised me out here?
He used to work at the studio your dad runs.
You know, so he was part of the system.
But I guess they had to let him go.
Something happened with some actress or something, and then he kind of had a breakdown, so we went back to Barstow.
But I came back here, 'cause I'm an actor.
I was in a commercial for gum, and I was the boyfriend in a Clearasil commercial.
You know, it's just kind of hard 'cause you can't really make it in this town unless you're really willing to do some awful things.
And, you know, I'm willing.
-Yeah, I guess.
-But I really want to get into video.
That's why I was thinking that Mark guy would be a great contact.
It's Martin.
All right.
Well, thanks for the...
-Yeah, absolutely.
-Yeah.
Hey, where you going?
I've got to drink some juice and then get some sleep.
You sure you don't want to stay?
I could really use the company.
Sorry, I gotta go.
I think something's gonna happen.
Les Price for two at 8:00.
It's actually three.
-I asked Rachel.
-Who's Rachel?
The girl I met on the beach today.
And when were you going to tell me this?
I don't know.
Now, I guess.
I didn't think it would be a problem.
I mean, is it?
Well, I guess there's going to be three of us.
-Hey, Tim.
-Hey, how are you?
Good, thanks.
Rachel, this is my dad, Les Price.
-Hi, Mr. Price.
-Hello, Rachel.
You here in Hawaii on your own?
No, but my parents are in Maui tonight.
So...
You both look nice.
-Thanks, you look great.
-Yes.
You do.
So what did you two do after the beach today?
Well, I watched Tim perfect his hair for two hours, then spend another two hours choosing which shirt he's gonna wear.
Now I understand why.
So did anybody see that Robert Waters is here?
-Who's that?
-Come on, Tim.
Robert Waters.
Star of The Flight Patrol.
It's a television show.
On television.
I don't know.
I guess I just must not watch enough TV.
Yeah, right.
Wait.
You don't know who Robert Waters is?
No, I don't.
-You do, I guess?
-Well, I met him at Reagan's inauguration.
God, I thought everybody knew who Robert Waters is.
I don't.
-Why do you guys care?
-Well, it's a little weird.
-Why?
-He's here with three guys.
The very macho star of Flight Patrol is here with three dudes.
So?
So one of them tried to pick up Tim today.
Me?
When?
At the beach.
Today at the bar.
-That guy?
-Yeah.
That guy.
Look, he was nice.
He was a nice guy.
Yeah, I'm sure he was really nice.
Real nice.
You smoke?
-I told you, Tim.
-What?
-It's bad for you.
-He knows.
I told him last night.
Am I blowing this in your face?
I mean, really?
Is this actually bothering you?
I mean, we're outside.
Look, you just shouldn't smoke, Tim.
Okay.
I'm gonna go finish this cigarette somewhere else, since you two don't like it.
The odds looking pretty good tonight, Dad?
-Tim, stop.
-Let him go.
Well, thank you for dinner, Les.
-Hey.
Hey.
We're not done here.
-No, look, just tell Tim that I'm sorry.
Let's have another drink.
Come on.
You know, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
Don't let him spoil the party.
Come on.
We're not going to another shitty party just because you're fucking the hostess, okay?
And she's married, and her husband's there.
I mean, you'll honestly fuck anybody, right?
I fucked you, dude.
Nice.
Where the fuck was Christie tonight?
Wasn't she supposed to be at the party?
Christ, I guess I forgot to tell you.
She hasn't been feeling too well.
She had to stay in.
-Wait, are you staying at her place?
-No.
She moved in with me and Nina.
-Nina...
Nina Metro, out in the colony?
-Yeah.
-Since when?
-It's been a couple of days.
It's weird, she has these night sweats and swollen glands and this weird rash
-and these little purple bruises...
-Wait, she's sick?
Yeah.
She wanted to get out of the condo and hang at the beach.
She said she'd feel better there.
Martin, I need to know something.
Are you and Christie, like, fucking around?
You guys fuck around when I'm not there?
No.
No.
I wouldn't do that to you.
Holy shit.
You...
Wow.
You really, really like her, don't you?
This isn't just a thing for you.
You actually care about her.
-I need something, Martin.
-You need some fucking ludes.
No, I need something more than this!
Graham, what else is there?
You already have everything.
I need someone to tell me what is good.
Okay?
And I need someone to tell me what's bad.
Because if nobody tells you these things, Martin, then how do you know what's good and what's bad?
And then what happens?
What happens...
What happens then, when nobody tells you these things?
-Can I help you?
-Hi, I'm Dirk.
Who are you?
-Nobody.
What the fuck do you want?
-I'm looking for someone.
-Well, I'm the only one here, so...
-But I have something to pick up here.
I think you've probably got the wrong house.
Where's Peter?
-He's not here.
-Dude, a deal was made.
Now I don't know who you are, but there's something here that now belongs to us.
Look, I don't want any trouble, so I think you should just leave, all right?
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, all right?
-You got the wrong place.
-No.
This is the right place.
The fuck are you looking at?
Look, I told you, Peter's not here.
And I don't know anything about what the fuck you're talking about.
-I'm just really tired.
-This is very important, so think carefully before you answer.
-Tell me where the fuck Peter is.
-I can't tell you that, 'cause I don't know.
This is simple.
Peter was paid.
We want what we paid for.
-Now where is it?
-I swear to God, I don't know.
Well, you better find out because he will be in a very dark place if we become disappointed, and we're becoming extremely disappointed.
As soon as he gets back, I'll tell him.
I just don't know when that's gonna be.
I'll see you again.
Laura.
I...
I need a shot, and I couldn't find any syringes anywhere.
I mean, with the move and everything.
You don't have any, do you?
I've got one in here.
I saw her, William.
I saw her at the restaurant.
-You saw who?
-Don't make me say her fucking name.
-What are you talking about?
-Just go get dressed.
I'm not gonna have this conversation with you if you're going to lie.
I'm not going to do it.
I'm not going to do it anymore!
If you want to talk to me, you're going to tell me the truth!
-Yeah, I want to talk to you.
-The other night at dinner.
When you came back and you sat down at the table and you said the Brodkeys' benefit.
I know why you want to go.
I know why you want to go.
Do you think I'm an idiot?
-No.
-You know what I do wonder?
If you still have feelings for her, then why are you in this house?
Why are you still in this house?
Are you that selfish?
To think that I would stay here with you while you fucked her?
Is that what you're thinking?
Do you ever think about anybody else but yourself?
Do you ever think about me?
Do you ever think about your children?
-Our children.
-Our children!
You did this for our children?
For Graham?
He's in college.
He deals drugs.
And he thinks you're a joke.
-And Susan?
Susan loathes you!
-That's not true.
Yes, that is very true!
For one time, for one time in your goddamned life, be honest with me, William.
Did you ever love me?
Did you ever love me?
-Tell me, did you ever love me...
-I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
You were afraid you'd be lonely, is that it?
You were afraid you'd have to give me 50% of everything you think you own, is that it?
No.
That's not what this is about.
God.
Oh, God.
I'll go to the benefit with you.
And we'll walk in there and we'll wink and we'll wave and we'll have drinks, and we'll let everybody know we're just fine.
And then you can come back home here and you can pack your things and you can leave.
So, yes, I'll go to the Brodkey benefit with you.
Why would you want to do that?
I want to see her.
Hey!
Where you been?
You weren't in the room.
Tim, what's wrong?
What happened?
What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong.
You want to talk?
Did you just ask me if I want to talk?
Well, yeah.
Yeah.
We could talk.
What?
What are we gonna talk about, Dad?
I don't know.
You tell me.
There's nothing to talk about.
Please...
Please, Tim, come on.
There's nothing to talk about.
Come on.
Give me a chance.
Don't ruin my chances.
You don't have any chances left to ruin, dude.
Come on, Tim, you don't mean that.
There's nothing.
There's nothing.
Just accept it.
It's easier that way.
Just forget it.
There's nothing you can tell me, and there's nothing I'm going to tell you, Dad, that's gonna make any difference.
Some fucking blond kid came by the house.
Yeah, what did he say?
-He was asking me about a package.
-Yeah?
Did you give it to him?
No, I told him we didn't have it.
What?
-What did Dirk say?
-What?
You know his fucking name?
What did Dirk say, Jack?
-He said he'd be back.
-Fuck!
They're gonna kill us!
They're gonna kill us!
Who the fuck are these people?
I think it would be in our best interest if you get your shit and we get the fuck out of here, okay?
I told you.
I told you we shouldn't have come here.
Shut the fuck up, Mary!
Just get your shit and let's get out of here, okay?
No, it's not my fucking problem.
I got a fucking job.
I can't just fucking pack up and move.
You don't know what they're capable of, okay?
You ain't got a goddamn clue.
They're like out of a fucking nightmare.
So get your shit together and let's get the fuck out of here.
Come on, Mary!
What are you doing?
Listen, if we leave the kid here and they find him, this is a more humane way than letting them get their hands on him.
Let me do it.
Let you do what?
-Let you do what?
-I'll handle it.
How are you gonna handle it?
I'm gonna cut his fucking throat.
Get the fucking van ready.
Come on, Mary.
-Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
-Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Clean yourself.
Just clean yourself up.
-Hello?
-Yes, hello, I'm looking for Graham.
-Yeah?
-Graham, it's Nina Metro.
-I'm calling about...
-Who?
We've actually got an emergency with Christie.
I was hoping you could come down.
-Hello, can I help you?
-Hi.
-I'm Graham.
-You're Graham?
Yeah.
She's really sick.
She needs to see a doctor, but she's so stubborn, we can't talk her into it.
-Well, where's her dad?
-He's on location in Italy.
-That's an answer?
-She needs help, Graham.
-Why do you think I can help her?
-Well, aren't you the one that loves her?
What's that gonna fix?
Is that gonna help her?
Hey.
What are you trying to tell me, baby?
What are you saying?
I want...
I want to stay.
But it's getting cold.
But I need more sun.
There's no more sun.

What the fuck?
Tell me something, Roger.
Set your watch back.
There's a time difference.
We're landing in Los Angeles.
It's a city in California.
Anything else you want to know?
You all right, Bryan?
You on edge?
Want a Valium?
Lude?
Gum?
I used to live here, didn't I?
What did he call it?
A talking tomato?
It's a fucking extraterrestrial, Ron.
So you're telling me that he's not gonna sign off until we redesign the talking tomato?
Well, that's bullshit.
Ron, listen, listen to me.
Let me inform you of something, okay?
We don't let 25-year-olds tell us how to make movies.
Listen, I gotta go.
I gotta go, Ron.
Just call...
Ron, call me later, okay?
Fast-acting Power Soap really gets in and blasts stains leaving your whole wash fresh and clean with a brightness that people will really notice.
Wow!
That's incredible.
I thought that ketchup stain would never come out of Joe's polo shirt.
Whites simply come out whiter and colors simply come out brighter.
It's the kind of clean that people will really notice and talk about.
How did you lift those coffee stains?
I thought I was gonna have to throw my new pantsuit out.
I blasted it out with Power Soap!
...and lets you get on with your day.
President and Mrs. Reagan visited the grieving families and bereaved widows of the more than 200 Marines killed last Sunday in Beirut.
He used the occasion to condemn the actions of what he called...
"ruthless terrorists who... "
What time is it?
10:30.
Fuck.
Fuck.
We gotta go.
We're gonna be late.
Right.
That.
I forgot.
Christie, come on.
What are you doing?
I don't feel well.
I don't really want to go.
Neither do I.
Look, I'm not gonna let you...
Good morning.
Look, you want to know why you're not welcome at my house?
Because you're fucked up!
That's not a good enough reason.
That's not even a reason.
That's just one person's opinion.
Look, I don't even want to fucking deal with you right now, do you understand me?
Listen, I'm calling you from a payphone outside of Barstow and I ain't got any more quarters.
It's simple.
Me and the Indian need a place to hang out for a couple of days.
We have a plan.
I don't want to hear about your fucking plan, Peter.
It doesn't involve you, so stop pissing yourself.
When you lose a child you can't help but wonder what that child's life would have been like.
You can't help but imagine his future.
A future that now doesn't exist.
But Bruce lived a full life, and there's some comfort in that.
And that he was a good boy and that he had done all the things he had ever wanted to do.
That the privilege and freedom that was granted to him during his brief time in this world were what made him happy.
I tell myself that I can only cherish one fact.
He had everything.
And now, in conclusion...
I'm going to play Bruce's favorite song.
It meant a lot to him.
- Hi.
- Hi.
So I made the reservations for 8:30.
- Where?
- Spago.
Okay.
Did you tell Susan and Graham?
Well, no.
I thought it was just gonna be the two of us.
William, I'm not really comfortable with that right now.
Okay.
Well, I'll call them and tell them to join us, then.
- Or you could call them.
- No.
No, you should do that.
Okay.
What the fuck was with that favorite song, man?
Bruce had shitty taste in music, but no way.
Personally, I think his mom just liked it.
The real question is, what in the hell are my mom and dad doing by the sushi bar?
I mean, they're actually talking to each other.
At least your mom and dad are talking.
My mom gets to talk to my dad through his lawyers.
Guess what?
I get to go to Hawaii with the asshole.
I can't fucking believe this shit.
- I can't believe you guys are acting this way.
- Acting?
What way, Ray-Ray?
Don't tell me he's gonna cry again.
Fuck!
Face it.
Bruce was a jerk.
Okay?
He's dead.
It's over.
Let's not fucking dwell on it.
I can't believe you guys don't fucking give a shit.
You seem like you don't give a shit.
Look, Raymond, there's nothing we can do, okay?
It happened.
It's over.
It's time to move on.
He's right, Raymond.
It's already been a week.
Okay.
Bruce...
Bruce was a...
A cool guy.
What else can I tell you, Raymond?
I'm sorry it happened.
"Bruce was a cool guy"?
Really, Graham?
Okay, what does that even mean, "Cool"?
Especially after that shit he pulled with Christie.
- Martin, what the fuck are you doing?
- What shit did he pull with Christie?
- Martin.
- Bruce was fucking her behind your back.
What, like, you all knew about this?
Graham, you always say that you're not that serious about Christie.
And it's not like you haven't fucked around.
You know, you're never gonna win Boyfriend of the Year.
- She's my girlfriend, Martin.
- Look, who even knows if it's true?
It's just something Bruce told us and that he bragged about.
Hey, does anybody want to go to a movie?
Sure, what's playing?
I can't believe you guys are gonna go see a fucking movie.
What the...
I can't believe you don't give a shit, man.
- I was there, you asshole.
- Hey, come on!
I watched him fucking bleed to death just like you did so don't give me this shit about how I don't care.
I had his blood all over my face.
Fuck.
Someone should go talk to him.
Tim, Bruce thought Raymond was an asshole.
He fucking loathed the dude, okay?
And what the fuck does it even matter?
We're having a fucking wake at the Beverly Hilton.
I mean, come on, do you get it?
Come on.
Get up.
Bruce wouldn't want to see you like this.
He was my friend, right?
Yeah.
He was your friend.
Are you lying to me, Graham?
No.
I'm telling you the truth.
How's work?
It's good.
I have a full slate of movies that are testing really high.
- There's one you might really like.
- Yeah?
What's that?
It's a movie about this 12-year-old boy who becomes the president.
The president of what?
The United States.
Sounds better than the one about the talking car.
How's Graham?
Well, you know your brother.
He's a little hard to reach.
But I'm sure he's upset about his friend's death so, you know, it's tough.
When I saw him at the memorial, he seemed fine, though.
He seemed fine at Bruce's memorial?
Yeah.
So how's Cheryl, by the way?
I'm not seeing Cheryl anymore.
What?
When did this happen?
That's something I wanted to talk to you about, actually.
- You talk to your mom lately?
- We talk.
You know, when she's coherent, which is rarely.
Why?
Well, Mom and I are moving back in together.
We're going to live together again.
She didn't tell me that.
- How do you feel about that?
- Great.
Great.
This is a really good move.
Yeah.
Really good.
Seriously?
I mean, you really think it's great?
Well, to be honest, it hasn't totally hit me that you might actually be serious.
I'm serious.
We're going to be a family again.
Graham and I aren't moving back in, Dad.
We're not gonna be a family.
You and Mom are gonna be a couple again, but we're not gonna be a family.
Martin?
You can't call the house anymore.
Why?
Is there someone here who cares?
You just can't come over here anymore.
- No.
- Are you going to tell me why?
William is moving back in.
Are you telling me he dumped the newscaster chick?
So...
Big Bad William is moving back in.
So the fuck what?
Unless you wanna shell out for a room at the Bel-Air...
No, Martin.
Martin, you don't understand.
We can't do this anymore.
We can't do it.
It's over.
Right.
Just like it was over the last time?
Martin, don't.
Baby.
I see.
Well, could I at least borrow 60 bucks?
I have to pay this guy for these Billy Idol tickets.
And I forgot to go to the Insta-Teller and, you know...
You know, it's just really a massive hassle, so...
What can I do for you, Mr. Metro?
Can you just get these kids out of here, man?
- Hey!
What are you doing?
Come on.
- All right.
Time to go.
No!
Hey, Jackson.
How's it hanging?
What the fuck are you doing here?
I told you I was coming.
What'd you think, it was a joke?
One fucking night.
And that's it.
You understand me?
Jackson, will you chill out, man, and show your Uncle Pete a little love, huh?
Well, where's this fucking Indian friend of yours?
Indian's in the desert.
What the fuck does that even mean, "The Indian's in the desert"?
Indian did some bad stuff.
Decided to stay in Barstow.
He's laying low, if you get my drift.
But Mary's in the van.
- Who's Mary?
- Come on, I'll show you.
Jackson, this is Mary.
Mary?
Mary, this is Jackson.
Is she okay?
Yeah, she's sort of just taking it all in.
She saw some stuff.
Bothered her.
- How old is this girl?
- I don't know.
Sixteen.
Seventeen.
I never ask.
Lucifer?
What the fuck are you doing with two underage kids?
How many times are we gonna go through this?
It does not matter if it was consensual.
I fucked up my hand.
How'd you do it?
Did someone help you?
I did it shaving, man.
Who the fuck cares?
My hand is fucked up.
Just...
Just call a doctor, Roger.
We are meeting Gary Gray, the movie producer.
You know, I don't know if I'm going to be able to make that meeting, Roger.
Look, I'll send the hotel doctor up and then you're gonna pull it together.
And when I knock on your door, you are going to answer it without your cock hanging out of some 14-year-old girl's ass.
Got it?
And you're going to be wearing something with long sleeves.
- Why?
- Multiple choice.
A, you look nice in long sleeves.
B, you have holes in your arms.
C, you have holes in your arms.
Or D, you have holes in your arms.
- C.
- Really?
Yeah?
Graham, it's for you.
- It's Dirk.
- Shit.
Hey, Dirk.
Yeah.
What do you need?
Yeah, I can get that for you.
Okay.
A little business?
Yeah.
And my fucking car's at my mom's.
- Can you give me a ride?
- Can't.
I'm going to Hawaii.
Well, fuck, dude, give me a better excuse than that.
I wish I could.
Thanks.
Aloha.
Can you give me a lift?
Don't look at me, dude.
Bye.
So how're you doing, Tim?
I'm good.
Fine.
How are you?
I'm doing good, I guess.
- You want a drink?
- No, that's all right.
Come on.
Have a drink.
- I'm okay.
- I'm gonna pour you one anyway.
So, what have you been up to?
Kind of a tough thing about that friend of yours dying, huh?
- You want to talk about that?
- What time does the plane leave?
11:00 sharp.
You wanna hear something?
Who's this?
- I think it's Devo.
- Who?
It's a group called Devo.
Great.
I love it.
Yeah.
Hey.
Hey.
I think it's great you could finally get away with your old man, you know?
Your mom said maybe you weren't gonna be able to make it.
- But here you are.
- I'm here.
We're going to Hawaii.
It's gonna be great.
The virus's unknown origin and seeming selectivity is creating fear.
Gays, intravenous drug users and Haitians seem particularly to be at risk.
The virus reacts almost like a contagious form of cancer.
I'm trying to stay positive.
I think in my situation it's very...
And it's where film meets rock and we're all happy.
- Bryan.
- Okay, an idea for a movie.
And the reason we came to Bryan Metro is because people remember how intense that movie turned out about the life of the band.
Holy Christ, man, the four of you guys, Sam and Matt and...
- Ed.
His name was Ed.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
That's known as a real tragedy, huh?
A real shame.
Upsetting, too, I bet.
Right?
When your bassist jumps from the roof of the Clift Hotel, I'd say so.
They'd already split up by then, so...
Yeah.
Well, anyways, since that movie about the life of the band turned out to be so cool and so profitable, without exploiting anyone we were wondering if you'd be pleased and thrilled to star in a movie one where you would actually play yourself.
We get so many scripts.
Bryan turned down Amadeus, so we're very fussy.
Well, this movie is basically your typical rock-star-in-outer-space-type thing.
There's this alien creature, this ET.
- ET?
- Extraterrestrial.
Alien.
Yeah.
The ET sabotages Bryan's limo after a gig and there's a big fiery chase and somehow...
- We haven't quite got that nailed yet...
- Yeah, go on.
You all end up on a planet where Bryan falls in love with a princess.
We're thinking Pat Benatar or a Go-Go for that.
In order to escape the planet you have to play in this big concert for the emperor who's basically this giant tomato.
So it's madcap, right?
- It's not tacky...
- Yes.
...and everyone is getting very excited by it.
Bryan?
Bryan.
Bryan?
Thank you so much for coming.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Christie, you know my sister, Susan, right?
- Have you guys met?
- Yeah.
Hi.
Okay, well, I'm gonna get a drink.
- Cool, baby.
You wanna bring me one, too?
- Nice shirt.
Ditto.
Does she always dress like that?
Movies, restaurants and stuff?
- You a little jealous?
- Graham!
Hey, mellow out.
Did you know they were gonna go through with it?
What?
Mom and Dad?
Yeah.
Mom mentioned something when I woke up.
What a scandal, huh?
Oh, my God, you're so stoned.
You're such a stoner.
I can't even talk to you.
I'm really not stoned, okay?
Just mellow out.
- You should talk to him.
- And say what exactly?
I don't know. "Dad, this isn't a good idea.
Don't go through... "
Okay?
All right.
Let's take off, all right?
What do you say?
Graham, do you even care what he did to Mom?
And now he's back and he's just gonna do the same thing again.
Look, I had to take care of her, okay, Graham?
I had to take care of Mom, and I'm not gonna do it again!
Graham.
Graham!
Please.
We have to do something, okay?
If Dad pulls the same shit again, Mom isn't gonna make it.
This will destroy her.
Do you understand?
Cheryl, there's someone on the phone.
- William Sloan.
- Thank you.
- What?
- I called the house and no one answered.
I was hoping it was the wrong number.
Yeah, well, it's not the wrong number.
So why haven't you been home?
Because I've been busy.
I'm filling in for Suzanne Yakomiato.
I really want to see you.
What about Laura, William?
What about her?
What about Laura?
I think I really miss you.
I think I'm making a big mistake.
- Let me go!
- Shut up!
- Mary, go!
- I have no license.
Get in the fucking car and drive.
What do you think?
About what?
What do you think I mean?
Next to us.
Them.
What about them?
Don't you go out with girls?
Pardon me?
Don't you, like, date females?
What are you asking me?
The odds look good.
The odds look pretty good.
Ladies, what are you drinking tonight?
Pahohoes.
Pahohoes?
That sounds intriguing.
They're delicious.
Hey, Hickey?
Why don't you bring these two gorgeous ladies another round of pahohoes?
Where you gals from?
We came in from Chicago.
I'm Patty and this is Darlene.
Yeah.
The Windy City.
- I know it well.
- Where are you both from?
Los Angeles.
City of Angels.
I'm Les Price and this is my son, Tim.
He's a little shy.
Just the two of you?
Just the two of us.
Hey.
I hope...
I hope I'm not being too forward if I may ask you something.
- I'm sure you won't be, Les.
- Jesus.
Well, I was just wondering if you're here with anyone.
- We're here alone.
- All alone.
- All alone.
- Can I have the key to the room?
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the room.
Where do you think I'd be going?
- You didn't finish your drink.
- I don't want the drink.
Just give me the key.
I'll go up with you.
No.
Just stay here, see how it plays out with Patty and Marlene.
That's Darlene.
What's wrong with him, Les?
Troubles in school.
- His mother.
- Okay.
No, no thanks.
You said you were hungry.
I made this for you.
No, my stomach's queasy.
I'm not really hungry anymore.
I really don't know how something like this could happen.
It all seemed to be going so well and now it's just a big mess.
It'll never happen again, I promise.
You're not gonna fire me, are you?
Well, no, I'm not gonna fire you.
Look, I have no idea what this is.
- And another one on my foot.
- Yeah, I don't know what it is either.
Look, Christie, tell me something.
What?
What do you think about Martin?
He's cool.
He's hot.
Yeah, hot.
Well, I know that, but I'm just not sure...
I'm at the same place that you are you know, with everything that's been going on with him.
Forget it.
Sorry I brought it up.
Graham.
Martin's not even staying here.
He's staying at Nina Metro's.
Even though he said she was insane.
That reminds me.
Did you get tickets for tomorrow night at the Greek?
Bryan Metro?
Graham.
You know he doesn't mean as much as you to me.
Come on.
Graham, we're all just having fun, you know?
Like, you take it all so seriously.
Yeah, but you're also sleeping with him, and it's just stressing me out.
What's wrong?
You know I'm on the pill.
Graham?
- Graham?
- Yeah?
You're forgetting something.
What?
We're both sleeping with him.
We're both sleeping with Martin.
And if I'm cool with that then...
To new beginnings.
So I'm totally psyched.
We're gonna go see Bryan Metro at the Greek tomorrow night.
That is, if Graham remembered to get the tickets.
Yeah, I got the tickets, and stop saying "totally. "
- Who'd you get them from?
- Actually, honey, from me.
- Through the studio.
- Good.
I'm glad he didn't go through Martin.
I didn't want to go through Martin even though he could have gotten us backstage.
Who cares?
He's such a stoner.
He's so into himself.
Him and his totally grody tan and his stupid hair.
Plus, Mom, get this.
He's a male prostitute.
- Why did you direct that statement to me?
- Just mellow out, okay?
I don't even know why we're talking about Martin.
And Mom, Martin's not a male prostitute.
That's on the record.
Why do you think I would care?
Martin is coming to the show with me and Christie so I hope you get over how, "like, totally grody"
...you think he is by tomorrow night.
I hope your girlfriend remembers to wear a shirt by tomorrow night.
- Where are you going?
- I'm going to the restroom.
And hopefully, when I get back, my lovely children will have finished their conversation about their delightful friends.
Hi, honey.
You're here with her, aren't you?
- Yeah.
- Oh, God.
No, don't.
Sweetie, I know you're pissed.
I understand, I understand.
But I missed you.
I couldn't help it.
- I can't do this.
- You can't do what?
You don't want me anymore?
Sweetie, I want you so bad.
That's not the point, William.
I can't sit here again and listen to you quote numbers about how expensive your fucking divorce is gonna be.
Is it not enough that you've made everyone fucking miserable?
Just stay away.
Please.
You know, I kept the condo.
I haven't given it up yet.
We could meet there tomorrow night.
What do you say?
Or I got the Piper Cub back.
It's at the hangar.
It's ready to go.
We could fly to Vegas and stay at Caesars.
- It'll be amazing.
- My God, William...
I'm not going to Vegas with you.
Well, at least you're going to be at the Brodkey benefit Friday, right?
We could talk there.
Okay?
Sure.
- Why not?
- Great, honey.
That's what I want to hear.
It's so good to see your face.
We'll figure it out.
It'll be okay.
- Yeah.
- Anyway, I better go.
Okay?
Fuck!
Laura, are we going to the Brodkey benefit on Friday?
Why would we go to the Brodkey benefit on Friday night?
That's TV.
It's not only TV.
And it should be fun.
- Besides that, it's for a good cause.
- It's for a perfume, William.
I don't want to go to the Brodkey benefit Friday night.
What would you like to do instead?
Sleep?
Lay by the pool?
Maybe count your shoes?
Can Daddy borrow $4,000?
What the fuck are you still doing here?
I thought I told you to go.
What?
Are you gonna fucking ignore me?
What the fuck's going on?
What the fuck are you doing, Peter?
What the fuck did you do?
Answer me, God damn it!
Shut your mouth, Jack.
What the fuck?
The kid's gonna bring us some money.
That's the plan.
That's the plan I informed you about.
This is the plan.
Your fucking plan is goddamn holding a kid ransom?
It's not me, Jack.
It's them freaks I met out in West LA.
The people I heard about out in Barstow.
They pay $6,000, $7,000 a pop for a package like that.
You make me fucking sick.
Hey, man, you need to relax.
That's your problem, Jackson.
You don't know how to kick back.
Even when you was a kid out in the desert and all there was was the sand and the rock and the silence you could never accept the fact that that's where you belong and that's where you're always gonna be.
That was a long time ago.
And we're not in the fucking desert anymore, Uncle Pete.
I think we still are.
- Hello?
- Is Martin there?
I don't know.
Let me check.
Couldn't find him.
Do you know where he might be?
Have you tried his place in Westwood?
- No, I haven't.
- He could be there or he could be finishing up that music video on the hills.
- Is this Julie?
- Julie?
Yeah.
The girl Martin picked up at 385 North?
With the white rabbit?
We all went back to my place and partied with Graham?
You and Martin disappeared?
Hello?
No.
This isn't her.
I'll call back.
Fuck me.
Cut.
Cut!
What the fuck are you doing, dude?
I can't see shit.
- Hey, Graham.
- Yes, totally fucking excellent.
Perfect timing, dude.
We are so in need of your services.
Wait, hold on a second, Leon.
We really have to get this shot.
The video doesn't make sense without it.
It's a fucking video, Martin.
It doesn't need to make sense.
It just needs to be not lame.
Graham, you got us covered?
- Yeah, man, you're all set.
- Totally excellent.
Hey, hey, hey.
Isn't Christie supposed to be here?
I thought she was supposed to be the star.
I did, too.
But she's a little unreliable.
Maybe you realize that now?
So, where are you staying tonight?
Probably at Nina's, in Malibu.
- Who's Nina?
- Nina.
Nina Metro.
- Bryan Metro's wife?
- Ex-wife.
Christ.
Where are you staying?
Honestly, Martin, I don't know how I feel about the situation anymore.
I think I'm just gonna crash at my mom's.
- Look, I've got eight more shots.
- Yeah.
You're busy.
Can we shoot this, you fucking cokeheads?
Hey, Tim, why don't you get your old man another mai tai?
- Hey.
- What?
Why don't you get your dad and yourself a drink?
- What do you want?
- Mai tai.
Okay.
What are you up to?
Met a girl from San Diego.
Hey, come on.
- Hey, Cheryl.
Nice to see you.
- Hi.
- How are you, sweetie?
- Good.
I just wanted to grab a quick salad or something.
- Do you have anything open?
- Sure.
Let me see.
Excuse me.
Shit!
Fuck you, you fucking asshole!
- Hi.
- Hi.
What would you like, hun?
A garden salad and a glass of water, please.
Okay.
- You're Cheryl Moore, right?
- Yeah.
- I think you're great, honey.
- Thank you.
The piece you did on the anniversary of Sharon Tate.
I remember when that happened.
It was so awful.
- Yeah.
- It was just so sad.
- Thank you.
- Yeah.
All right.
Hey!
Aren't you on the news or something?
- Yes.
- You're Cheryl Moore, right?
- Yeah.
Do you have a light?
- Sure.
Listen...
Can I have your autograph?
'Cause I am, like, your biggest fan.
There you go.
Thanks a lot, Cher.
By the way we're opening for Bryan Metro at the Greek tonight.
You wanna go?
You know, I really don't think I can.
Got it.
Thanks a lot, Cheryl.
Hello?
What's going on?
How are you?
How did you get this number?
Did Roger give it to you?
Could I just speak to Jamie, please?
Well, he can't right now.
He's...
- He's on the beach with a friend.
- Who?
A friend of his or a friend of yours?
You know, that's just great, Nina.
That's great.
Can we...
Can we just get this over with?
Can I just speak to my kid this time without having to freak out?
Please?
You know you don't even have visitation rights, Bryan.
Just put him on the phone, Nina.
No, I mean, I don't even know why you want me to say this...
Just tell whoever you're fucking to bring my kid out and put him on the phone!
Okay.
No.
You know what, Bryan?
I'm going to hang up now.
Just because I don't have visitation rights does not mean I'm not allowed to talk to my kid.
Now, if you want me to call my lawyers, Nina, I'll call my fucking lawyers!
Fuck your fucking lawyers, Bryan!
- I'll call my fucking lawyers.
- Fuck them!
Fuck, all right, Nina, look, I'm sorry, man.
I'm sorry.
Please, Nina.
I don't mean to shout.
I just...
Bryan, listen to me.
Don't you fucking call me or him ever again.
He's fucking afraid of you!
Fucking afraid of me?
And don't fucking...
You...
What about you, you Medusa?
You fucking Medusa!
- Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
- Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
- Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
- Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
- Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
- Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Good evening, sir.
Surprised?
Do you want to know who I am?
Are you from around here?
Not really.
I'm actually from Nebraska.
A little town near Lincoln.
You had a job at the mall, right?
But the mall closed down, right?
It's all empty now, huh?
Have you been there?
I've been to a mall in Nebraska.
It's all flat.
It's all totally, totally flat.
Come here.
Clear the area.
All of these vehicles need to be moved.
What's going on?
You scared me.
I don't know.
I guess some guy's like threatening to shoot his wife or maybe he shot her or something.
They got the SWAT team out there and everything, man.
- If I were you, I wouldn't go out there.
- Yeah, I won't.
So you're on the eleventh floor, right?
Yeah, the guy who does the videos visits you all the time.
You mean Martin.
It's actually my girlfriend's place.
- I'm Graham.
- Yeah, I know who you are.
- You want a cigarette?
- Yeah.
It's...
It's kind of a small world, 'cause the guy who raised me out here?
He used to work at the studio your dad runs.
You know, so he was part of the system.
But I guess they had to let him go.
Something happened with some actress or something and then he kind of had a breakdown so we went back to Barstow.
But I came back here... 'cause I'm an actor.
I was in a commercial for gum and I was the boyfriend in a Clearasil commercial.
You know, it's just kind of hard 'cause you can't really make it in this town unless you're really willing to do some awful things.
And, you know, I'm willing.
- Yeah, I guess.
- But I really want to get into video.
That's why I was thinking that Mark guy would be a great contact.
It's Martin.
All right.
Well, thanks for the...
- Yeah, absolutely.
- Yeah.
Hey, where you going?
I've got to drink some juice and then get some sleep.
You sure you don't want to stay?
I could really use the company.
Sorry, I gotta go.
I think something's gonna happen.
Les Price for two at 8:00.
It's actually three.
- I asked Rachel.
- Who's Rachel?
The girl I met on the beach today.
And when were you going to tell me this?
I don't know.
Now, I guess.
I didn't think it would be a problem.
I mean, is it?
Well, I guess there's going to be three of us.
- Hey, Tim.
- Hey, how are you?
Good, thanks.
Rachel, this is my dad, Les Price.
- Hi, Mr. Price.
- Hello, Rachel.
You here in Hawaii on your own?
No, but my parents are in Maui tonight.
So...
You both look nice.
- Thanks, you look great.
- Yes.
You do.
So what did you two do after the beach today?
Well, I watched Tim perfect his hair for two hours then spend another two hours choosing which shirt he's gonna wear.
Now I understand why.
So did anybody see that Robert Waters is here?
- Who's that?
- Come on, Tim.
Robert Waters.
Star of The Flight Patrol.
It's a television show.
On television.
I don't know.
I guess I just must not watch enough TV.
Yeah, right.
Wait.
You don't know who Robert Waters is?
No, I don't.
- You do, I guess?
- Well, I met him at Reagan's inauguration.
God, I thought everybody knew who Robert Waters is.
I don't.
- Why do you guys care?
- Well, it's a little weird.
- Why?
- He's here with three guys.
The very macho star of Flight Patrol is here with three dudes.
So?
So one of them tried to pick up Tim today.
Me?
When?
At the beach.
Today at the bar.
- That guy?
- Yeah.
That guy.
Look, he was nice.
He was a nice guy.
Yeah, I'm sure he was really nice.
Real nice.
You smoke?
- I told you, Tim.
- What?
- It's bad for you.
- He knows.
I told him last night.
Am I blowing this in your face?
I mean, really?
Is this actually bothering you?
I mean, we're outside.
Look, you just shouldn't smoke, Tim.
Okay.
I'm gonna go finish this cigarette somewhere else since you two don't like it.
The odds looking pretty good tonight, Dad?
- Tim, stop.
- Let him go.
Well, thank you for dinner, Les.
- Hey.
Hey.
We're not done here.
- No, look, just tell Tim that I'm sorry.
Let's have another drink.
Come on.
You know, I'll see you guys tomorrow.
Don't let him spoil the party.
Come on.
We're not going to another shitty party just because you're fucking the hostess, okay?
And she's married, and her husband's there.
I mean, you'll honestly fuck anybody, right?
I fucked you, dude.
Nice.
Where the fuck was Christie tonight?
Wasn't she supposed to be at the party?
Christ, I guess I forgot to tell you.
She hasn't been feeling too well.
She had to stay in.
- Wait, are you staying at her place?
- No.
She moved in with me and Nina.
- Nina...
Nina Metro, out in the colony?
- Yeah.
- Since when?
- It's been a couple of days.
It's weird, she has these night sweats and swollen glands and this weird rash...
- And these little purple bruises...
- Wait, she's sick?
Yeah.
She wanted to get out of the condo and hang at the beach.
She said she'd feel better there.
Martin, I need to know something.
Are you and Christie, like, fucking around?
You guys fuck around when I'm not there?
No.
No.
I wouldn't do that to you.
Holy shit.
You...
Wow.
You really, really like her, don't you?
This isn't just a thing for you.
You actually care about her.
- I need something, Martin.
- You need some fucking ludes.
No, I need something more than this!
Graham, what else is there?
You already have everything.
I need someone to tell me what is good.
Okay?
And I need someone to tell me what's bad.
Because if nobody tells you these things, Martin then how do you know what's good and what's bad?
And then what happens?
What happens...
What happens then, when nobody tells you these things?
- Can I help you?
- Hi, I'm Dirk.
Who are you?
- Nobody.
What the fuck do you want?
- I'm looking for someone.
- Well, I'm the only one here, so...
- But I have something to pick up here.
I think you've probably got the wrong house.
Where's Peter?
- He's not here.
- Dude, a deal was made.
Now I don't know who you are but there's something here that now belongs to us.
Look, I don't want any trouble, so I think you should just leave, all right?
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about, all right?
- You got the wrong place.
- No.
This is the right place.
The fuck are you looking at?
Look, I told you, Peter's not here.
And I don't know anything about what the fuck you're talking about.
- I'm just really tired.
- This is very important so think carefully before you answer.
- Tell me where the fuck Peter is.
- I can't tell you that, 'cause I don't know.
This is simple.
Peter was paid.
We want what we paid for.
- Now where is it?
- I swear to God, I don't know.
Well, you better find out because he will be in a very dark place if we become disappointed and we're becoming extremely disappointed.
As soon as he gets back, I'll tell him.
I just don't know when that's gonna be.
I'll see you again.
Laura.
I...
I need a shot, and I couldn't find any syringes anywhere.
I mean, with the move and everything.
You don't have any, do you?
I've got one in here.
I saw her, William.
I saw her at the restaurant.
- You saw who?
- Don't make me say her fucking name.
- What are you talking about?
- Just go get dressed.
I'm not gonna have this conversation with you if you're going to lie.
I'm not going to do it.
I'm not going to do it anymore!
If you want to talk to me, you're going to tell me the truth!
- Yeah, I want to talk to you.
- The other night at dinner.
When you came back and you sat down at the table and you said the Brodkeys' benefit.
I know why you want to go.
I know why you want to go.
Do you think I'm an idiot?
- No.
- You know what I do wonder?
If you still have feelings for her, then why are you in this house?
Why are you still in this house?
Are you that selfish?
To think that I would stay here with you while you fucked her?
Is that what you're thinking?
Do you ever think about anybody else but yourself?
Do you ever think about me?
Do you ever think about your children?
- Our children.
- Our children!
You did this for our children?
For Graham?
He's in college.
He deals drugs.
And he thinks you're a joke.
- And Susan?
Susan loathes you!
- That's not true.
Yes, that is very true!
For one time, for one time in your goddamned life be honest with me, William.
Did you ever love me?
Did you ever love me?
- Tell me, did you ever love me...
- I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
You were afraid you'd be lonely, is that it?
You were afraid you'd have to give me 50% of everything you think you own, is that it?
No.
That's not what this is about.
God.
Oh, God.
I'll go to the benefit with you.
And we'll walk in there and we'll wink and we'll wave and we'll have drinks and we'll let everybody know we're just fine.
And then you can come back home here and you can pack your things and you can leave.
So, yes, I'll go to the Brodkey benefit with you.
Why would you want to do that?
I want to see her.
Hey!
Where you been?
You weren't in the room.
Tim, what's wrong?
What happened?
What's wrong?
Nothing's wrong.
You want to talk?
Did you just ask me if I want to talk?
Well, yeah.
Yeah.
We could talk.
What?
What are we gonna talk about, Dad?
I don't know.
You tell me.
There's nothing to talk about.
Please...
Please, Tim, come on.
There's nothing to talk about.
Come on.
Give me a chance.
Don't ruin my chances.
You don't have any chances left to ruin, dude.
Come on, Tim, you don't mean that.
There's nothing.
There's nothing.
Just accept it.
It's easier that way.
Just forget it.
There's nothing you can tell me and there's nothing I'm going to tell you, Dad that's gonna make any difference.
Some fucking blond kid came by the house.
Yeah, what did he say?
- He was asking me about a package.
- Yeah?
Did you give it to him?
No, I told him we didn't have it.
What?
- What did Dirk say?
- What?
You know his fucking name?
What did Dirk say, Jack?
- He said he'd be back.
- Fuck!
They're gonna kill us!
They're gonna kill us!
Who the fuck are these people?
I think it would be in our best interest if you get your shit and we get the fuck out of here, okay?
I told you.
I told you we shouldn't have come here.
Shut the fuck up, Mary!
Just get your shit and let's get out of here, okay?
No, it's not my fucking problem.
I got a fucking job.
I can't just fucking pack up and move.
You don't know what they're capable of, okay?
You ain't got a goddamn clue.
They're like out of a fucking nightmare.
So get your shit together and let's get the fuck out of here.
Come on, Mary!
What are you doing?
Listen, if we leave the kid here and they find him this is a more humane way than letting them get their hands on him.
Let me do it.
Let you do what?
- Let you do what?
- I'll handle it.
How are you gonna handle it?
I'm gonna cut his fucking throat.
Get the fucking van ready.
Come on, Mary.
- Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
- Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Bryan!
Clean yourself.
Just clean yourself up.
- Hello?
- Yes, hello, I'm looking for Graham.
- Yeah?
- Graham, it's Nina Metro.
- I'm calling about...
- Who?
We've actually got an emergency with Christie.
I was hoping you could come down.
- Hello, can I help you?
- Hi.
- I'm Graham.
- You're Graham?
Yeah.
She's really sick.
She needs to see a doctor, but she's so stubborn, we can't talk her into it.
- Well, where's her dad?
- He's on location in Italy.
- That's an answer?
- She needs help, Graham.
- Why do you think I can help her?
- Well, aren't you the one that loves her?
What's that gonna fix?
Is that gonna help her?
Hey.
What are you trying to tell me, baby?
What are you saying?
I want...
I want to stay.
But it's getting cold.
But I need more sun.
There's no more sun.
Please state the purpose of your visit.
Visiting family.
In Markham.
Thank you.
Next, please.
Refugees.
Please.
Please state the purpose of your visit.
I have three days of meetings here before I move on to Montreal.
Merci.
Au revoir.
Please state the purpose of your visit.
Well, hello there.
Is your mother or father travelling with you?
Do you have anything to show me?
Some papers?
That's very nice.
One second.
Yeah, can you send someone over from Special Handling?
Flight number?
Are you joking?
At this point, we're still searching for what carrier he came in on.
Christ.
Well, let's keep him here till we figure things out.
It's incredible that he could've got in without somebody somewhere papering him.
How could something like this happen?
Don't ask me.
I've got my own department to worry about.
You don't know where he's from, you don't know what processes they've got.
Maybe they've got shit.
I hope that's not the case.
Why are we being so quiet?
He doesn't understand a word we're saying.
Hey, you wanna come here?
Right there.
Good.
Okay, smile, honey,
I'm going to take your photo.
... Yeah.
Okay, well, there are three possible flights he could've come in on.
Yes.
So I need you to track down those manifests and...
Shit, I gotta call you back.
Hey.
Don't drink that, that's not good.
There's a water fountain right over here.
Come on, I'll show you.
Hey, you wanna come to the farm with me?
I was gonna pass through there on the way to my friend's.
Come on.
It's got all the best animals.
Cows, horses and goats.
Sheep.
Just stay here.
Hey.
Hi.
Don't bike in the road, Cayle.
Hear me?
- Y es.
Stay on the sidewalks.
Where'd he go?
- Who?
That boy.
We were playing a game together.
What, you have a new imaginary friend?
He wasn't imaginary.
You know I'm your only non-imaginary friend, don't you?
Listen, I have something to show you.
You won't believe it.
- What?
What is it?
Not here.
Where?
Let's go to our place.
Look at this.
Listen.
"Residents of Toronto's Cabbagetown
"have reported sightings
"of what they claim to be a strange, sapiens-like humanoid
"scurrying around in the cavernous underworld
"of the picturesque neighbourhood.
"One Parliament St. resident
"describes his run-in with the creature.
"It occurred while he went in search of his missing kitten.
"He discovered a hidden passage leading under a building,
"and there saw a dead kitten and the alleged monster,
"covered in slate-grey fur.
"After the creature whispered in a raspy voice,
"'Go away, go away,'
"it scurried off down a 45-degree-angle tunnel which descended as far as the man could see."
Wow.
- Can you believe that?
A monster, living underground.
Do you think it's real?
- Y eah.
How do you know?
- 'Cause I do.
Well... my mom says that monsters aren't real.
Well, they are.
Your mom just says that so you won't be scared.
My mom used to tell me the same thing.
That's what moms do.
Let's see it for real.
I know where there's an entrance.
Where?
- In the ravine, under the subway tracks.
- I don't know--
- Come on, Jacob.
What's the matter?
You scared?
Ahhhh!
- Whoa!
You're such a sissy.
- But you scared me!
Mamma's boy.
- I am not!
Ah!
Come on!
You're too fast!
Cayle!
Where are you taking us?
Who's Cayle?
I am the great Queen Alabantia.
My kingdom is under siege by an evil intruder from another land.
Is there any brave knight out there who might be able to save me from this horrible intruder?
Me.
And who art thou, "Me"?
Sir Jacob... of Riverdale!
So you're brave, are you?
The bravest.
- Prove it.
If you prove it,
I have many riches to offer you in return.
Many.
C'mon!
You're in there.
Aren't you?
What are you?
What are you?
Ow!
Look who it is.
The freak and the dyke.
You two lovers now?
Fuck off, Zack.
Oooh, "fuck off"!
That's pretty tough.
You telling me to fuck off, dyke?
I'm not a dyke.
Dyke.
Whatcha gonna do?
Watch as we beat on your little--
Come on!
Don't just stand there, kick her ass!
Fucking pussies!
Don't you ever let anyone talk to you like that!
Ever!
Hear me?
Okay.
Promise?
Promise.
Cayle?
- What?
I want to find it.
What?
I want to go find the monster.
You do?
But we can't.
Zack and them are still back there.
They'd kill us.
Tonight, then.
At midnight.
Jacob, are you sure?
Hello?
Oh, hi, Mom.
Good.
Yeah.
Okay.
All right.
Bye.
Uh, I gotta go.
Dinner's ready.
Okay.
Tonight.
Come by my house at midnight.
Set your alarm and sneak out.
I'll bring flashlights and a knife just in case.
Okay.
Midnight.
Promise?
- Promise.
I'm home!
Hi, honey.
- Hey, Mom.
Did you have fun with Cayle today?
Yep.
You stayed in the park, right?
- Mm-hmm.
All right.
Go get washed up.
Dinner's on the table.
Help me.
Okay, let's go.
That's good.
Wh-what happened?
What?
- Your arm.
What happened to your arm?
I...
I fell.
What did you fall on?
Nothing.
Does it hurt?
Yeah.
Do you wish your mom was still around?
Yeah.
I hate him.
You ready?
Yeah.
Shhh!
Did you hear that?
- No.
Wh-what'd you hear?
I...
I dunno, like a moan or something.
Let's keep going.
Go away!
Come on!
Did you see it?
!
Did you see it?
!
Yeah!
Yeah, yeah, I saw it!
His shoes.
Look at his shoes.
His shoelaces are tied.
The guy just jumped!
Let's go.
I'm sorry it's so cold in here.
My furnace blew up yesterday.
Wow.
That's cool.
I never usually talk to strangers.
No, me neither.
But...
I'm glad you did.
What do you do?
Oh, I'm a designer.
I build things.
What sort of things?
Well... furniture, um, various objects, shoes...
Cool!
Yeah, my Kicks.
Do you have any questions for me?
No.
Well... do you, uh... the, uh, the beads?
What do you think of the beads?
I never actually thought about them.
My ex-boyfriend put them up.
What do you think?
From a design perspective... they're not very practical.
Say you want to serve food...
Right.
Oh.
If you want,
I can lend you my Bead Be Gone spray.
Tsshhh...
Tsh-tsh-tsh-tsh.
Thank you, that would come in very handy.
What's wrong?
Well, this big Somalian guy kneed me in the gut when I was playing basketball.
Oh.
Well...
I borrowed this book from the library.
What?
That is a Photoshop federal offence.
Some of the most interesting books have the ugliest covers.
This one's about a boy who was born with the gift of touch healing.
He lays his hands on a person's injury and heals them.
You believe all that?
- Yeah.
You want me to try healing you?
Sure.
Uh, I don't know what you did, but... actually, I think it feels better.
Good.
Boris, do you think it's strange we're lying on the bed beside each other?
- No.
Have you ever been in love?
Mm-hmm.
Never?
No.
Are you gay?
- No.
No, I just, uh...
I always imagined that one day...
I would see a woman... and fall instantly in love with her.
It just hasn't happened yet.
Ah, it's late.
I gotta bounce.
I like your beard.
It suits you.
Thanks.
- It's kinda like Ernest Hemingway.
Yeah, I thought I'd grow it out.
- You mean for warmth?
Well, yeah...
Y eah, I mean, kinda.
I thought it'd be cool.
It's kind of a female repellent.
You know, when you got, like, a ton of guys hanging off you, and you're just like, "Whoa, chill, chill out.
No, I-I... don't know what that's like.
It doesn't really work is the thing, 'cause some girls really like it.
I guess you...
I guess you go out... on a lot of dates?
Tch...
Y es.
Like romantic dates?
No.
No, no, no.
Well, I mean, aren't all dates romantic?
Not necessarily.
Is this a date we're on?
I think so.
"Dative... dating agency...
date rape...
"date:
A particular day of the month or year,
"the time at which a particular event has occurred or will occur."
There's a "To date."
"An appointment, especially a romantic or social engagement."
So there you go.
Romantic.
Social.
I mean we're both right.
Imagine if you knew every word in the dictionary.
I'd have a hardcover.
Oh, well, that was a gift.
If it was up to me, I'd have a hardcover, too.
Boris, I have to tell you something.
I think...
I think I have a crush on you.
Yeah, I thought you might.
Is it okay if I kiss you?
Yeah.
Ahem.
Willia I never would've approached you.
Are you a shy guy?
Yeah.
"Love shy" refers to a debilitating shyness that impedes the ability to form
Iong-lasting romantic relationships.
Love-shy sufferers experience an overwhelming fear of intimacy.
Love-shy men are prone to anti-social personality disorders.
How to get a guy to like you.
Make conversation.
People with Asperger Syndrome are neurologically unable to understand other's emotions.
... and respect you as you are.
Rekindle the energy that dilutes your attracting confusion in your relating.
Crown myself the prince of buzz
Can't wait until you can't wait
Till you unsubscribe
I'll be a lonely scribe
Whoa.
Imagine trying to fight a war in that.
Y eah, not very practical.
That look is deadly, though.
Happy belated birthday.
- Whoa, this is all for me?
Yup.
Yeah, this is one of my favourite books.
Oh, and this - that is the night that I first saw you.
I knew I liked you right away.
Did you mean to draw it in this shape?
Like, with everything?
No.
Um...
I-I actually just started drawing and it... turned out that way.
It's, uh... it's so... awesome.
It's... it's really a nice card.
Thanks.
You're welcome.
So what do you think of what happened between us the last time?
I was surprised.
A good surprise, or a bad surprise?
Well I...
I had a good time.
Phew.
I thought I had come on too strong.
No, it's okay.
I wouldn't know, really.
I'm not... that experienced, actually, so...
How many times have you had sex?
Four... four times.
But one was like a... two-night stand?
What if we made a trade?
I mean, I've never built anything ever.
You could teach me how.
I mean, we could design it together.
And if you teach me how to build something,
I could teach you about sex.
Sounds like a good deal to me.
Whoo!
Marine-grade, uh, teeth..
might be nice.
That's what...
Seriously!
Are we gonna do this, or what?
Slit!
Thank you.
Oh...
Ow!
- Ow!
You're gonna have to take that off.
But it's my protection.
Not anymore.
Okay, T each.
Wow.
You shave.
Well, you know... it's like, uh, not as messy... and I like the way it looks.
It's, like, less... animalistic.
It looks good, right?
Y eah.
Good.
Alright, dear, brace yourself.
At the count of three, breathe in.
One... two... three!
How's it going?
Good.
So...
I got... a...
What?
I got a--
- A what?
I got a tat...
- You got a tattoo?
No, not a tattoo.
- All right.
But I got a--
You're killing me over here!
What is it?
I GOT A BRAZILIAN!
So you wanna come in?
Actually, I promised my dad I'd watch the World Cup with him.
I see.
Well, call me sometime, will ya?
Yeah, yeah... fo' sho.
Uh, have fun with that Brazilian.
When am I gonna see you again?
I...
I dunno.
Whatever.
I'm kinda like Polkaroo.
Who's Polkaroo?
Well, Polkaroo's like a creature... who kinda comes and goes.
Like me.
Polkaroo is the imaginary creature from the children's TV show Polkadot Door, broadcast by TV Ontario.
Polkaroo never spoke, other than to exclaim its own name.
Only one of the two hosts could see Polkaroo at a time,
leaving the other to cry.
"Polkaroo was here and I missed him again?"
Howdy do Polkaroo
How are you Polkaroo
What do you say Polkaroo
Polkaroo
Hey...
What are you doing here?
Excuse me.
There's a boy.
I think he's lost.
Boris, I need to talk to you.
I had to see you...
Because I need to know...
Actually, I have to know.
Are you interested... in a romantic relationship with me?
Well it's a really... it's a really hard decision... to make . but no I'm not.
Y'know, it's not you.
It's me.
I-I have to... stay open to some things.
It's okay.
Now I know.
Y'know?
It was the not knowing that was driving me crazy.
I couldn't stop thinking of you!
I had no idea you felt that way.
I mean, I...
I never think of you.
I mean, I never... really think about you when you're not... around.
It's fine.
I'm glad we cleared that up.
I feel a lot better.
Does this mean we can't have sex?
Are you sure about this?
Yes.
God, you are so beautiful.
And the crazy thing is, you don't even know how amazing you are.
Omigod...
Okay, hold on.
Wait.
No...
Oh, God...
Oh, God.
Oh, no.
Oh.
Oh, crud.
Oh, crud.
Oh.
Are you okay?
Yeah...
Uh...
I never...
I never should've come over here.
I...
I should've trusted my instincts.
Where are you going?
I can't...
I'm going... home!
Okay, slow down.
I have to go!
- I'm not a monster trying to keep you captive here.
- All right, what?
So talk to me.
- I'm talking to you!
When are we gonna see each other?
I don't know, okay?
I can't say!
- Why?
Because, Willia, you don't...
It's too defining!
Stop!
Don't go.
Run to the thing you fear the most!
Uh, you're pointing at me.
Oh.
Sorry.
Oh...
Willia.
This is really... hard to explain.
I'm doing my best.
I have to... go.
Boris, come on.
Remember when we first met?
You told me that you believe that you'll fall in love at first sight.
It doesn't work that way.
Real love takes time.
You're probably right.
I never... got to choose.
I was never chosen.
Goodbye, Boris.
Bye.
A young male child reportedly of North African descent, age nine or 10, has gone missing from an Immigration holding area at Pearson International Airport.
Police have issued a citywide Amber Alert.
We'll continue to bring you updates as this story develops.
Turning to the weather for the--
Ahem.
Get outta here!
Ha-ha!
You're shittin' me!
What's up, man?
How's everything?
Cool, man.
- Hold on, hold on, we gotta get something to eat.
- A'ight.
Let's go, let's go, jump in, jump in.
What, this your "Streak Free"?
- You know it.
Check it out, streak free!
- Oh, a'ight.
It's not a bad job, know what I mean?
That pays all right, it's outside, and no one's looking over your shoulder.
Back in the day, you said you'd never wear a uniform.
Yeah, I did.
But I talked a lot of shit back then, so.
You did a lot of shit back then, too.
Things are different.
Three years sober, man.
Can't say the same here, bud.
Come on, man.
You still into that same shit?
It's easier to cop on the inside.
You know that.
When d'you get out?
- Recently.
Y'know, I was dreamin' about these fries.
I was thinkin' about how much I like them and I was jonesin' for 'em bad, y'know.
But it's like, if you don't eat 'em in time, and you let 'em get cold, they're shit.
Somebody would've to force you to even eat just one.
Had a lot of time on your hands to think about shit like that, huh?
Fuck you.
You like Chinese girls?
Look at that one.
Mm!
Yeah, Dougie... that's your Chinese, man.
'Cause she was nice.
Lookit.
Lookit, lookit, lookit, lookit!
How much this guy pay you to do this anyways, man?
Why, you want a job?
- No, all I'm saying is, whatever he's paying you, he's making like three times more.
You should get out from underneath his--
Don't worry about all that.
I got it, I understand all that.
I'm just saying, you should go out on your own.
Go out on your own.
How you doin', man?
Why don't you grab a shammy and squeegee and do some work?
That's a funny-looking hat, but underneath that hat is - y'know what I'm sayin'?
- it's all about what's underneath--
Why don't you grab a shammy and a squeegee, man?
If I bring you to my place of work, I expect you to work, bro.
You want me to work for you now?
I just got out of two...
I'm not gonna work for you!
So you still seeing' that girl, Chantal?
No.
Uh-uh.
Too bad, man.
She was nice.
So... so what's up with you anyways, man?
I'm gonna check out Roshanna.
Roshanna!
Yeah, I heard she was getting engaged.
What are you talking about, engaged?
She's not getting engaged, man.
What are you talkin' about?
!
- I probably heard wrong, y'know what I mean?
It's--
- No, you heard wrong!
We were just takin' a break, man.
We didn't break up!
We said we were gonna take a break.
That is all!
Same old Dougie.
We interrupt your broadcast with a breaking news bulletin.
An escaped prisoner may have made his way into the city.
Twenty-six-year-old Douglas Shannon walked out of Collins Bay Correctional last night.
He is described as male, Cauc--
Look, man...
I'm still on probation, y'know what I mean?
I got it.
I can drop you off somewhere, man, you know--
It's cool, man, it's cool.
I got it.
It's not much, but you know how it goes.
Y eah.
- Be good.
Hey, Mommy.
Mm.
Sorry, I could not wait.
I didn't say anything, Chantal.
No, come on.
I'm eating and you smell sweaty.
Go shower.
Go.
Go, please.
So you feel anything today?
- Mm, a little.
Kinda felt like swirls.
No kicks today, though.
How was work?
You know same ol', same ol'.
What about you?
I threw up three times.
Mm.
- Mm.
What?
Nothing.
So why are you looking at me like that?
Like what?
I can't look at my wife?
Hmm?
- Mm-mm-mm.
No, because I'm fat.
- You're not fat, baby.
Yes, I am.
- You're pregnant.
And what, are you supposed to be skinny when you're pregnant?
Mm.
Actually, I have to pose for my swimsuit issue next week.
But right now,
I have to pee, so watch out.
Ah...
Ah...
What?
Oh, shit!
Hello.
- Alton, is Roshanna engaged, or not?
!
- Aw, come on, man!
I don't know!
I told you, I probably messed up!
You're such a fuckin' liar, Roshanna!
I'm gonna fucking kill you!
- No!
Who are you talking to?
- Uh, nobody, babe.
Listen,
I gotta take care of some powerwashers, okay?
Pick me up some ice cream?
- Y eah, yeah, yeah.
What kind, what kind?
- Um...
I dunno, maybe--
Listen, I'll call you in the store.
- Alright.
Get me some of that...
Rocky Road!
Doug!
Doug!
Shit!
I don't know what else to...
Don't fuckin' do this to me!
I don't know what else to say!
I told you what's happening!
You didn't tell me what's fucking happening!
Dude, you guys remember each other, right?
Doug!
What the hell is your plan?
!
You gonna kidnap her until her father gets home?
!
Don't be fuckin' ridiculous.
- This is crazy!
No, you're the only who gets to be ridiculous.
Keep it up--
- You're hurting me!
Hey!
Hey!
Doug!
Doug!
You're not fucking thinking ahead!
Please!
Doug, this is why we always got caught!
You can walk out right now!
Just fucking go!
Hey, I'll go if you come with me!
This is ridiculous!
If we leave now, nothing happens!
- Oh, shit's gonna happen, man!
I broke out of jail, I got a fucking gun!
Yeah.
Doug's got a master plan!
- Shut the fuck up!
Get out of my house.
- Your house?
This isn't your house, it's your daddy's house.
Okay, get out of my father's fucking house.
Now!
You think I enjoy this, coming back here and having you yell at me?
!
- What did you come back here for?
You know why I came back!
- Doug!
It is over!
It's over!
- That's how you treat people, right?
Doug, relax.
- First sign of trouble, and you just fuckin' take off?
!
- What?
!
First sign of trouble?
Doug, you just broke out of jail for armed robbery!
How else am I supposed to compete with all this?
You don't have to!
You never had to!
That's...
Shut the fuck up!
That's why you went off with what's-his-name and his fuckin' trust fund?
- Holy shit!
We had an understanding!
That's not fair!
That's right, we had an understanding!
We said we could see other people, not go get fucking engaged!
You want some water or something?
Uh, yeah.
Come on, this is fucking crazy, Doug.
You never offered me any fucking water.
Alton isn't waving a fucking gun in my face!
Hey, hey, hey.
- Can I go get him a fucking drink?
Yes!
Make me a sandwich.
Montreal smoked?
A little Dijon?
Yeah.
If I make you this sandwich, will you go?
Yes.
I'll go.
Ahem.
I don't wanna be here, man.
I don't wanna be here!
I came all the way from my house to make sure you didn't do something stupid!
Gimme the gun!
Doug!
Let me get--
Doug!
- Uh-uh-uh-uh-uh.
Okay.
There you go.
There we go.
Thank you.
Alton, you hungry?
Tch!
- You're gonna make me eat alone?
Huh?
- Yeah!
Suit yourself, man.
Ahem.
I'll have a ginger ale instead.
Are you kidding me?
I'm so sick--
Please, please!
Please, just get him the ginger ale.
You need to chill.
- I'm chilled, man.
Let me get the gun, man.
Fuckin' unbelievable, man.
Remember who used to look out for you.
Remember who's here right now looking out for you.
This is bullshit!
Give me the gun.
Selfish, man.
Ahhh!
- Oh, shit!
Run!
Run!
Run!
Fuck you!
Doug!
You should've left, Doug!
- Hey, hey!
Put the weapon down!
Kneel on the ground now!
Okay.
- Show me your palms, both of you!
But she cut my face!
Who do I talk to about that?
Doug, shut up.
- Put the weapon down!
Put your hands in the air!
- Just put the gun down.
Do it now!
- Okay, put the gun down.
We're okay, we're okay.
Put the fucking gun down, man.
Put the gun down!
Obviously fuckin--
Oh, you're so original, Doug.
So fucking original.
Shut up!
- Aaahhhhh!
Doug!
Look at me, bro, look at me!
Don't do that!
Don't do that!
Don't do that!
- Put the gun down now!
Hey, please, just relax!
Doug.
Come on, buddy, buddy.
- What are you gonna do, Doug?
Aaahhh!
- She's not fuckin' worth it.
Fucking do it, Doug, do it!
Keep her back!
Please!
Doug!
Doug, look at me.
Look at me.
Don't fuckin' do that, please.
Don't do that, buddy, don't do that.
Put the gun down.
Bro.
Put the gun down.
Take him!
- Hey, hey!
Relax, relax, relax!
- Get down, now!
Fuck, my feet!
Get down, get down, get down!
Why the hell you do this, man?
- You think I'm enjoying this, huh?
!
I know you're enjoying this!
... comes up in my face with a gun.
You're always gettin' me into something!
Let me be.
- Let you be?
That's what I shoulda did.
Yeah, I shoulda let your ass be, so you'd be up for murder!
Think I'm enjoying this now?
!
You are enjoying this shit!
You enjoy fucking your life up, and mine!
Shit!
Mine's just a bonus!
Shut up!
Shut up, man!
This shit is not funny, man.
... I don't care.
I just want him off my property...
So...
You're the one that tried to contain the situation?
Who, me?
Not you, convict.
You.
Kowalski, help me with this guy.
Hey... you're not gonna make a racial complaint, are you?
What?
Can you just get these off me, please?
Come over here;
I still need your statement.
It's been real, Doug.
- Later!
Have a seat.
- Much!
From the beginning.
Where did you come in on this?
Yo, Rosh...
Roshanna, come on!
What?
Come on, man, come visit me.
Co...
Wh...?
Did you look at my feet?
Did you see what you did?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry!
I'm sorry!
Wanna go take a look at the fuckin' door too, Doug?
Come visit me, I'm sorry.
Come on, Roshanna.
- Let it go!
Come on!
- Let it go, Doug.
I love you.
I love you.
Hello?
No.
Well, I just called the police.
I am the neighbourhood-watch lieutenant, you know.
Yeah, I just thought that, you know, it's strange -
I mean, you don't usually see... you know, window washers after 6 p.m.
Mm...
Where's my Rocky Road?
Hmm?
Shit.
- Aw...
I'm sorry, baby.
- Oh, come on.
I'll go get it.
- Hurry up.
... An Amber Alert was issued around 1 0 a.m.
Police describe the boy as less than 1 0 years old.
He does not speak English and was last seen wearing a dark suit...
Who wants to play?
I'll give you the first move.
I'll give you the first three moves.
I'll give you five, six moves!
I'll move three moves for you!
What do you say?
Huh?
You're not sure?
Come on.
Let's make a deal.
Let's an appointment.
Call me on your blueberry.
Hey, little man.
Lookin' sharp.
What you got there?
Mm...
Oooh, Canada.
Cool.
So what do you say?
I don't usually play with little men in suits, but it's a slow night so... you want a game?
Henry.
Ah, no.
Ah, no, no, no.
Now no game, no.
No.
Come on, Henry, you know the rules.
Time to clear out.
There's no-- ... playing chess in the station.
I know, I know.
I know, 'cause what would happen if everybody played chess at the station?
You'd have people sitting around-- Hey!
Don't do that.
Okay.
Okay.
Can you, um--
Y eah.
- Can you do that, please?
Sure.
... Police are quite concerned, because he's been without food or water for some time and is likely confused and lost.
Oh.
Okay, good.
Good, you're right here.
I'm not gonna hurt you, okay?
I have to take you someplace safe.
Okay?
'Cause it's not safe here.
So you have to come with me, okay?
You have to come with me.
Okay?
All right, so...
Okay...
Ugh!
Oh, what are you doing?
What are you...?
Give me that piece.
Give it to me.
Give me the piece.
Give it.
Gimme...
What... what are you...?
Don't put it in your pocket, gimme the piece!
I am gonna get somebody...
Uh... not him.
I'm gonna get somebody to help us.
Okay, so you stay there, and I'll be back, okay?
You trippin', Henry?
No.
No, I'm not.
I saw him.
He was here, Charlie.
- There's no one here.
I know that.
I know that.
We have to find him.
No, Henry.
I don't think you know the difference between what's real and what isn't.
I do.
I do.
- You do?
Okay, look.
You have to get out of here, or I'm gonna have to throw you out.
You understand that?
- Okay.
It's him.
I did see him.
Anybody see a little...
little kid, uh... uh, a sharp-dressed little boy?
Come on, did anybody see a boy.
Hey, get back here!
Argh!
Ahhh!
Ahhhh!
Okay, Henry, that's it.
- No!
I warned you.
Come on!
- No!
No!
Come on, this way.
- No!
Come on, calm down.
- No!
Henry, come on.
Don't make me hurt you.
Henry!
Don't try coming back in here, all right?
!
You've been warned!
Ahhh!
Oh, you shouldn't have done that!
Don't you know people can drown in two inches of water?
!
Don't you know that?
Don't you know that?
Yeah, Henry he's fine.
You all right?
Just gotta get some food into ya.
... chicken soup.
Remember that guy?
We always see him at the bus stations and the train stations?
Nah, I don't know who you're talking about.
The guy from the train station?
Uh...
J...
Oh, uh...
Jake...
Johnny!
Johnny!
- Johnny.
Yes, that's it, right.
Well, apparently,
Johnny's the guy who's got that kid's pictures up all over the city.
No way...
- Where the fuck is he?
!
Where the fuck is he?
Tell me where the fuck he is!
- I don't know!
Tell me where he is!
- I dunno, man!
He doesn't know anything!
- Get the fuck off me!
Is there a problem here?
No.
No problem.
Right, Eddie?
Right?
!
No, man, there's no problem.
Henry, I'm surprised at you, you're usually the gentle...
Henry!
- Huh...
Waiting for the world to come home
Everybody's gone
I'm here all alone
Waiting for the world
To come home
Waiting for the world
To come knockin' on my door
Just like it did before
Waiting for the world
To be born
Free from this shadow I want
To be lost no more
I'm waiting for the world
To...
Be born
Henry.
I need...
I need money.
Okay.
That's...
that's all that I have right now.
No.
No, no, no, no.
I...
I need more.
I need more, Beth.
It's important.
Why?
Please!
It's important!
Please.
Okay.
Give me a second.
Oh, no...
Oh...
Ahhhh!
Daddy!
No, no, no!
No!
- What?
Oh, shit!
Shhh.
It's okay.
Listen.
Listen.
Listen to me, it's on a timer.
I have to go.
- Okay?
And I never swim in it, Henry.
- I have to go.
You need to stay here and we need to talk!
We need to talk, Henry!
I have to go.
Hey, Mr. Hot...
Y eah.
I came here to do business.
- Sorry, only do business with friends.
- Hey, no, hey, Mr. Hot.
Mr. Hot, seriously.
Look, buddy, this isn't some fuckin' TV show...
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Hot, thank you.
Hey.
Which one of you is Twinky?
That's me.
- Okay, I got what you need.
C'mon, let's do some business.
Come on.
I have almost 20, but you give me an hour--
- I don't want your money.
You don't?
- No.
Alright, I'll do it, but you've gotta gimme at least--
No, not that!
- Then what?
!
Whaddya want?
Johnny the Freak.
You know where he is.
You tell me where he is.
- I dunno anything.
That kinda shit, I could get--
- Tell me where he is!
You gotta make it worth my while.
All of them.
Excuse me, officers - please, I need your help.
I need your help right now.
Can you put your coffees down?
Please, I need your help.
I need you to come with me, I've got an address.
Whoa, wait a minute.
What's going on?
I have an address and I need you to take me there!
Okay?
- You, you're not allowed in here.
No, there's no time.
- Let's go!
Come on!
There is no time!
There's no time!
No time!
- I don't let people like you in my store!
- You shouldn't have done that!
You shouldn't have done that!
- Get in there!
I came here to help!
You should listen to me!
I came here... to help!
Ahhh!
Officers.
Sonofabitch.
I thought I told you to stay the fuck out of my store--
- Hey, hey!
Relax!
Do not make you take me in, all right?
I know exactly where he is.
What are you talking about?
The little kid.
I took him.
So, Henry... what we got here are some vagrancy charges.
Nothing like forcible confinement or abduction...
Doesn't seem like you're the kind of guy that'd hurt a kid.
That's it?
You got nothing to say?
All right, Henry-- Ugh!
Shit, come on!
Ah...!
Little man!
Hey.
Little man, there you are.
Aw...
I've been worried about you.
Henry!
Step away from the boy!
He's right here.
- Step away from the boy!
Step away from the boy!
Ahhh...
- Just get him out of here.
He can't understand you!
You're gonna be fine, little man.
Oh, not in the puddle!
Not in the puddle!
You're gonna be fine, little man!
You're gonna be just fine!
You'll be fine!
He says he's not hurt.
All right, ask him about the homeless guy.
Ask him if that guy ever...
touched him.
He says no.
He brought him here, right?
Even he admits that.
He says no.
That's not possible.
He must've misunderstood.
Ask him again.
No, the other man brought him here.
The door was locked and he was really scared.
He then got frightened by the sirens and ran away.
The other man didn't do anything to him.
He would like to play chess with him.
Go upstairs.
See if that guy can give us anything on where to find this...
other guy.
And if he doesn't?
Then we let him go.
Now that you got him back, now that he's safe,
I need you to promise me something.
Yeah?
I need you to promise me one thing.
Sure.
- Okay?
Don't let him go swimming.
You live in your own world, don't you, Henry?
Don't worry about it.
I promise not to let him go... swimming.
Hey, Henry.
Wait a minute.
Hey, uh... why don't you let us get you into a shelter?
At least get you a meal.
Whaddya say?
No...
Well, let us give you a ride.
At least run you back to where we found you.
No, thank you.
No.
Thank you.

Waiting for the world to come home
Everybody's gone
I'm here all alone
Waiting for the world
To come home
Waiting for the world
To come knockin' on my door
Just like it did before
I'm waiting for the world
To be born
Well done, boys.
Looks like ice-cold sushi for breakfast.
No, no, son.
Over here.
See the lion?
Look at the lion and get the lion.
Now, son, if you're gonna grow up and be like your daddy someday, you gotta learn how to fight.
Da-da.
Now, Alakay, let me show you something, OK?
You see this mark?
You and me are the same.
When you're bigger, you'll be Alpha Lion, just like me.
Now let me see you fight.
Ready?
No, Alakay.
No dancing!
You just amuse yourself, don't you?
You're a strange kid.
You're a strange one.
I'm...
Now, come on, let's try it again.
No, Alakay.
Stop that right now.
Doggone it!
It's so disappointing when they don't grow up the way you want.
Makunga.
You're not challenging me again, are you?
Look on the bright side.
After I defeat you and become alpha lion, you'll have more time to spend with your pathetic son.
Before I kick your butt, let me ask you:
Why do you want to become the alpha lion?
I'm better looking, I have better hair, I'm deceivingly smart and I want everyone else to do what I say.
We fight on three.
One...
Pay attention, Alakay.
Daddy will show you how it's done.
Two, three!
- Who's the alpha lion?
- You are.
Don't you forget it.
And that, Alakay, is how you attack...
Alakay?
That's it.
Here, kitty, kitty.
This one's a beauty.
He'll be worth a few bucks.
It just gets easier and easier.
Daddy!
Alakay!
Alakay!
Alakay!
Da-da!
No!
No!
No!
Alakay!
- Daddy!
- Daddy's got you!
Hold on!
Da-da!
Alakay!
Daddy!
I've been around the world in the pouring rain
Feeling out of place and feeling strange
Take me to a place where they know my name
'Cause I ain't met nobody that looks the same
I'm a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle
He's a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle
I'm a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle
He's a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle
I need my peoples, my peoples Take me to my peoples
Play that jungle fever Show 'em some love
Show love
Just gotta have someone Gotta have someone
To relate to, to relate to
I'm feeling right at home
Feeling right at home Feeling right at home
Feeling right at home I'm feeling right at home
See I been traveling Been traveling forever...
- I don't like the looks of this guy.
- He's kind of cute.
He's kind of a showoff.
You think he's cute?
Roar!
The King of New York City Alex the Lion!
I still think he's kind of a showoff.
The guy's an animal.
Maybe he should take a break.
You know, we could all use a vacation.
Come on, where would we go on vacation?
I don't know about you, but I want to go to Connecticut!
On the loose, several animals, including the world famous Alex the Lion, escaped from the Central Park Zoo tonight.
The escapees were cornered in Grand Central Station.
He was a very bad kitty.
Animal rights activists, who convinced zoo officials to have the animals sent to Africa, were stunned to learn that the freighter carrying the animals was reported missing today.
Tonight, hundreds of New Yorkers have gathered at the zoo to mourn the loss of their beloved zoo animals.
The question on everyone's mind, where are they now?
I like to move it, move it
He likes to move it, move it
She likes to move it, move it
- We like to
- Move it!
Come on!
Y'all know this one!
It never gets stale!
- We like to
- Move it!
We'll miss you little fuzz buckets!
You've been a great crowd!
Glad we could introduce you to the toilet.
If you ever come look us up in Manhattan, feel free to call first.
Seriously though, call.
OK?
Settle down, everybody.
Be quiet!
You can't leave without this!
Surprise, freaks!
Shake it!
Shake it.
Look, I'm a lady!
I'm a lady, everyone!
I'm a lady!
Not really!
It's me, King Julien!
Which of you is attracted to me?
Hands up!
Hey, freaks!
You will be very glad to hear that I am coming with you.
Oh, no, thank you.
Yes, thank you.
It's my plane!
Until I return with the spoils from the new country Stevie will be in charge!
I don't think they like that idea.
What are you saying, Stevie?
No.
Could we?
No, you didn't say that!
How is that even possible?
Naughty little thing!
Stevie says...
Let them eat cake!
King Julien, wait for me!
I'm all packed!
I have a whole itinerary planned!
Oh, no!
It's Mort!
He's so annoying!
Don't let him on.
Stop that thing!
He's carrying scissors and hand cream!
Everybody in!
Quickly, get in, get in!
Get in quick!
- Struts.
- Check.
- Flaps.
- Check.
- Engine.
Coffee maker.
- Check.
You guys!
Oopsie-daisy!
That has to be the second biggest slingshot I've ever seen.
But it'll have to do.
Attention.
This is your captain speaking.
In the event of an emergency, place the vest over your head then kiss your... good-bye.
New York City, here we come!
Pray to your personal God this hunk of junk flies.
Personal God, hunk?
What?
We are go, sir.
Open the door!
I'm outside!
If cabin pressure is lost, place the mask over your face to hide your terrified expression.
Miss, aren't these supposed to be attached to my seat?
- No, sir.
- OK, boys, launch!
Launch!
- Launch!
- Launch!
Gremlin!
Hey, Mort.
Hi!
That was weird.
- Somebody's dreaming.
- I think I saw Mort on the plane wing.
You got Madagascar on the brain.
I know I'm gonna miss it.
It was incredible.
I think it'll seem more fun the further we are from it.
Like when you bit me on the butt?
I'm gonna take that thing you're holding onto and use it onstage.
It's all part of my little actor's salad bar of emotional tidbits.
Are the butts next to the croutons?
You don't need to be sarcastic.
When we get back, I might sign up for the breeding program.
Breeding program?
We reach a point when we want to meet somebody.
Settle down, have a relationship.
I can see that.
What?
Like dating?
Yeah, dating.
Other... other guys?
What do you mean, other guys?
Darn it!
What is holding up that beverage service?
!
I'm gonna go check.
You all keep talking.
I'm gonna catch a few winks.
It's so funny!
I like laughing!
It's such a nice experience!
To laugh!
Do you mind going back?
This is first class.
It's nothing personal.
We're just better than you.
Maurice, I'm open!
Hit me!
- He shoots, he scores!
- Is that Vivaldi?
- In-flight slave.
- Can I help you, Mr. Mankiewicz?
Bring my nuts on a silver platter.
We were checking on our drink order.
Sorry.
Been a little backed up.
- I guess I'll go back...
- Where's your body?
You're freaking me out!
Can you please go over there, please?
What happened to the separation of the classes?
I'm sure this democracy thing is just a fad.
We'll go out for pineapple, my bobbly-headed boobily-boo.
Skipper, look.
Analysis.
Looks like a small bulb used to indicate something unusual, like a malfunction.
I find it pretty and somewhat hypnotic.
That too, sir.
Right!
Rico?
Manual!
Problemo solved.
- We may be out of fuel.
- Why do you think so?
We've lost engine one and engine two is no longer on fire.
Buckle up, boys.
Don't look, doll.
This might get hairy.
Attention!
This is your captain.
I have good and bad news.
The good news is, we're landing immediately.
The bad news is, we're crash-landing.
When it comes to air travel, we know you have no choice.
But thanks for choosing Air Penguin.
Raise your arms, Maurice!
It's more fun when you raise your arms!
I can fly!
This could be it, Marty!
I want you to know you are a one-in-a-million friend!
Thanks, buddy!
You're the best ever!
- And you won't mind when I tell you...
- Tell me anything!
I broke your iPod!
The buttons were so small!
It made me mad!
- The horror!
- I'm sorry!
- I'll kill you, butt-biter!
- It was an accident!
- An accident!
- Butt-biter!
I love you, Gloria!
I always have!
Like you love the beach.
Or a good book.
Or the beach.
Goodness, doll, you're shaking like a leaf.
Rico, you've had your fun.
Pull up.
Gear down.
Gently.
You just want to kiss the ground.
Just a peck, a smooch, like you'd kiss your sister.
I said, kiss it!
Now just a little brake.
Just a touch.
I believe that's checkmate.
Commence emergency landing procedure.
Flaps up!
Deploy!
Oh, we're here.
What in the world?
What happened to the plane?
What did y'all do to the plane?
I'm OK.
I'm alive.
I can't even sleep for a minute.
This is not JFK.
Kowalski, casualty report.
Two passengers unaccounted for.
That's a number I can live with.
Good landing, boys.
Who says a penguin can't fly?
Hey, happy slappers!
Is there some reason to celebrate?
Look at the plane!
- We'll fix it.
- How are you gonna fix this?
Grit, spit and a whole lot of duct tape.
We should be up and running in, say, six to nine months.
- Sixty-nine months?
!
- No, six to nine months.
Kowalski, I say we use this setback to our advantage.
- Where'd you get that number?
- I want you to reconfigure the design.
How do you estimate that?
Pretty boy!
Why don't you and your friends dig a latrine.
Hold on.
Who made you king of the plane wreck?
Excuse me?
Fine.
You can be in charge.
You fix the plane.
Who gives you the authority to put me in charge?
OK, then I'll remain in charge.
Yeah, you will remain in charge.
You and your hippie friends stay out of our hair.
Correcto-mundo.
Because I decided to.
- Good for you.
- Well, this discussion isn't over.
Higher mammals!
Stay with us.
We could use your front cortexes and opposable thumbs.
Phil!
I should wash your hands out with soap.
How in the hell-o will they fix this plane?
!
You know, grit and spit and spit.
A lot of spit and grit and stick-to-it-iveness.
That don't sound too promising.
You're right.
We're stuck here.
As long as we're together, we'll be OK.
Yeah, but love ain't gonna get us home.
Behold!
The lion!
- People!
- There is much to see.
Moving on.
Wait, wait, wait!
People!
- They'll help us!
- Wait up!
- People!
Stop!
- Help us!
If you stop, I'll autograph those!
I know you!
You.
It's the bad kitty.
How do you like some of that?
!
Come in, Tokyo!
Right in the batteries.
You think an old lady can't take care of herself?
Next time, I won't go so easy on you!
Thank you, dear.
Moving on!
Are you out of your mind?
We need help and you harass old ladies?
!
Out of my mind?
Who's out of my mind now?
- See if you can get an operator.
- No problem.
Out of my mind.
We're going home.

This time I'm 40 percent sure.

Africa?
It's got to be.
Our ancestral crib.
It's in our blood.
I can feel it!
No, it's more than that.
It's like déjà vu, like I've been here before.
It's like Roots!
No, it's like déjà vu, like I've been here before.

Me and me friends fly, fly in great metal bird.

Then here we emerge.
We offer only happiness and good greetings.
Is he dancing about a plane crash?
Yeah.
We just... yeah.
I thought...
Sorry.
You came from off the reserve?
Way off.
From the Central Park Zoo, actually.
Don't strain yourself.
What's going on here?
They say they're from off the reserve.
That's impossible.
Only people come from off the reserve.
You look familiar.
Do I know you?
How could you survive the hunters?
We didn't see any hunters.
- What are you looking at?
- Me?
Nothing.
This watering hole doesn't need any more mouths to feed.
So skedaddle back to where you came from.
Is there a manager we could talk to?
I see.
You're here to challenge me!
What?
No!
No.
That's what it looks like to me!
Zuba!
Wait.
I'm trying to take care of business...
Yeah, yeah, Zuba.
Hold on.
Alakay?
Is that you?
No, it's Alex. lx.
Like New York Knicks.
Zuba, look!
I've always had that.
The vet checked it out.
It's kind of a beauty spot, really.
A mark.
All right, this is a little weird.
Honey, he's come home.
What?
You've come home.
Son.
Dad.
Mom and Dad?
Mom and Dad!
Mom and Dad!
It's my mom and dad!
I got a mom and dad!
My baby's alive!
Dad!
My son!
My son is home!
Alakay!
Alakay has come home!
Alakay!
Yeah!
The prodigal son returns.
This is perfect!
I thought you hated Zuba.
No, I do.
I do.
I do.
I hate him.
Oh, I do.
And I'm going to use Alakay, yes.
I'm going to use him to get rid of Zuba once and for all!
Giddy-up, feathered horse!
Make way!
Move out of the way!
Stand aside!
New York!
It's a bit of a dump.
Are you sure we're not in New Jersey?
Hello, New Yorkers!
Your new king is here!
This calls for a celebration!
Maurice, I think they like me.
You've got to love a non-hostile takeover!
Chukka-chukka what?
Excuse me.
I'm Marty.
I'm kind of new around here.
Hey, Marty!
You're a good-looking group!
You like to run?
Yeah.
Running is crack-a-lackin'.
That's right!
Crack-a-lackin'.
You guys speak my crack-a-lackin' language.
What?
You don't have doctors here?
Not anymore.
Well, what if you catch a cold?
We go over to the dying holes and we die.
You guys really need a doctor.
- We have an opening.
- Would you be interested?
Me?
A doctor?
It's raining men.
Hallelujah!
You all got it going on.
Why don't you have a man?
You got worms?
Oh, I got rid of those.
Listen, girls.
Manhattan is short on two things, parking and hippos.
Hey, everybody!
I just found out that my son is a doggone king!
The King of New York!
Show me some of your moves, son.
Don't be bashful.
All right.
This one always knocks 'em dead.
Roar!
Look out.
The King is mad.
The King is mad!
Let's welcome him back into the pride with open arms!
Welcome to the herd, Marty!
Me?
I've always wanted to be part of a herd!
- It's one for all...
- [all] And all for all, y'all!
How do I look?
Technically, a traditional witch doctor has a bone through his nose.
Don't worry... it's just a clip-on.
Voilà!
He's a witch doctor!
My mother will be so happy.
Look out!
I think Moto Moto likes you.
Here he comes.
I like 'em big
I like 'em chunky
I like 'em big I like 'em plumpy
I like 'em round With something' somethin'
They like my sound They think I'm funky
Goodness, girl... you huge.
Who's your friend?
Or is that your butt?
You as quick as you are hefty.
So you're Moto Moto?
The name's so nice, you say it twice.
I kind of like it, fatso.
I'll see you around, girl.
It won't be hard, because you so... plumpy.
Oops!
I hate to be a party pooper, Zuba, but some of the lions were wondering when you plan to banish your son.
- What are you talking about?
- It's nothing, really.
They're griping that Alakay never went through the rite of passage, blah, blah, blah, so technically speaking, he can't be a member of the pride.
It's nonsense.
I forgot about the rite of passage.
What is it?
What's this rite of passage?
A traditional coming-of-age ceremony.
Young lions earn their manes by demonstrating their skills.
- A show-of-skill talent show deal?
- Yeah.
Strutting their stuff.
A performance!
I think that's up my alley.
If it's tradition, I want to do it.
Strut my stuff.
Earn my mane.
I want to be Alaki.
- Alakay.
- Alakay!
Even better.
We will hold the rite of passage in the morning!
That's wonderful!
Good luck, Alakay.
Where I'm from, we say, "Break a leg."
That's my boy!
I'm a private dancer
A dancer for money
Any old music will do
Beautiful, isn't it?
It's amazing.
Guys this is where we belong.
Operation Tourist Trap is a go.
Oh, I like that one.
It works on many levels.
You guys are a bunch of suck-ups.
- That, too.
- Absolutely.
Stations.
Stage one.
Go!
Oh, no!
What have I done?
Come on, take the bait.
- What happened?
- Oh, look at the poor little guy.
Is it dead?
Stage two!
Go, go, go!
I will give him the kiss of life.
Rico!
Rico!
Reverse!
Gas!
Music!
No!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Come back!
What is all this rock'n'roll racket?
!
Is she dead?
No!
You hoodlums!
Good heavens!
Are you OK?
Lady, I found your pocketbook.
My handbag.
Such a good boy.
Nana can't survive without it.
You are one tough cookie.
Brownies Troop 416, Yonkers.
OK, nobody panic!
The best thing we can do is stay together.
We'll wait for another tour jeep.
It may take hours, but...
Where are you going?
I'm not staying here to be attacked by more animals!
I'm too old to die.
I'm going with her.
Old lady, wait up!
Please!
We need to stay together.
Fine!
We'll go that way!
Does anyone want a hard candy?
- Easy now.
- Watch your step.
And right here...
OK, are you ready?
This is where you always slept.
Oh, man!
- Was this mine?
- Look at you.
Look at him.
Oh, this thing.
Look, look!
- I remember this!
- He remembers.
A little harder than...
You never slept on the right end.
You always slept on the bottom end.
Is that?
Is that my?
Is that me?
You had the cutest little paws.
Little, little bitty ol' paws.
You did that the day we lost you.
Wow.
I was so young.
What happened to me?
It was all my fault.
I turned my back and...
It was not your fault.
Your father did everything he could.
He tracked those hunters for weeks.
Far off the reserve.
Finally, I had to assume the hunters well...
We thought they'd killed you.
But my son fought them off!
Don't mess with the King of New York!
- That's right!
- Keep your chin in.
You boys be careful!
Watch out before you break something.
You used to call this "foofie."
"Foofie"?
Foofie.
He doesn't want that.
This is my foofie!
Zuba, you better give him his foofie.
I mean, no, thank you, thank you.
It's perfect.
Son, you get your rest.
You have a big day tomorrow.
You'll need all your strength.
I will bring the house down for you.
I hope so.
Otherwise, your father will have to banish you.
Jeez, Mom, really?
I know you'll do us proud.
You know why?
You were born with it.
Good night, Alakay.
My boy.
My own boy.
My son's a king.
My son's a king.
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Alakay.
Foofie.
Look at foofie!
My foofie!
Foofie, foofie, foofie.
My foofie!
No sign of civilization.
Everybody appears very tired.
I think we're lost.
Nana, do you know where you're going?
No, but I'm going with a skip in my step and a smile on my face.
Sure, right, OK.
Yeah, all right.
- It's people.
- How did you get here?
- Can you help us?
We're lost.
- We're lost too.
It was awful.
A flash of black and white and they were gone.
They took the jeep!
- That happened to our jeep too!
- What do we do?
How will we all survive?
No food, no water, no shelter.
What are we gonna do?
!
You can let nature get the best of you, or you can get the best of nature.
Gather 'round, children.
We're New Yorkers, right?
Yeah.
We survive the concrete jungle!
When we need food, we hunt for a decent hot dog stand.
- Am I right?
- She's right.
When we need shelter, we build skyscrapers.
- Exactly!
- When we need water, we build a dam.
We're New Yorkers, for crying out loud!
If we can make it there, we can make it anywhere!
I'm coming, King Julien!
Bad fishy!
Bad fishy!
No, shark, no!
Sit!
Why am I laughing?
We have all the parts we need, but we're slightly behind schedule.
- How slightly?
- Six to nine years.
- Sixty-nine years?
- No, six to nine years.
Private!
What happened to our thumbs?
Haven't seen them since yesterday.
Darn you, Darwin!
Nobody goes AWOL on my watch.
Private!
You're coming with me.
Rico!
You're coming with me!
- We'll bring them in for court martial.
- That won't be necessary!
We've recruited a few extra thumbs for you, Skipper.
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.
Oh, I doubt that.
Enough lollygagging.
Let's get to work.
There'll be three groups.
Group Alpha will do sheet metal fabrication.
Group Bronson handles assembly.
Group George Peppard, craft services.
Any questions?
Good!
Let's get to work.
I'd like to kiss you, monkey man.
All right, but you're so darn ugly.
Remember, little cub scouts, a great dance performance comes from the heart.
Straight from the heart, you'll never go wrong.
Sure, mister.
Hey, Alakay, I just happened to walk by, I thought I'd wish you luck.
- You're not nervous, are you?
- Nah, it's my thing.
In my opinion, the key to this is choosing the right competitor.
You mean, this is like a dance battle sort of thing?
- Like a dance-off?
- Sure.
Great.
I love that.
Freestyle.
Who'd be a good match for me?
Just to keep things interesting.
Well, I wish I could help, but that's strictly against our ancient tradition and all we hold sacred.
But if it was me out there...
I'd choose Teetsi.
Teetsi.
OK.
Sounds interesting.
Makunga, right?
Thank you.
Anything for Zuba's boy.
Go get 'em, tiger.
Shake it out.
A five, six, seven, eight.
Let's go, let's do this.
Let us begin the rite of passage ceremony.
- Come on, baby!
Make Mama proud!
- Woman, I'm trying to take...
On it, Mom!
Who will be the first participant?
Me!
Oh!
Me, me, me!
Me!
Me!
Me!
Me, me!
Please, me?
How about you?
The tall, handsome one.
Yeah.
Choose your opponent.
Let me see.
I guess I'll pick Teetsi?
Teetsi?
Why did he pick Teetsi?
That's my boy!
He's got some gumption there!
Somebody, wake him up!
All right, so, Teetsi, come on.
Let's do this, huh?
Come on, little tsetse fly.
Let's see your stuff.
Bring it.
- Let's dance!
- OK.
But let me warn you that I am a protégé of Fosse and Robbins!
Not "dance" dance!
Fight!
Dance fight!
You got it.
- Is he dancing?
- What's he doing?
I know that boy is not dancing.
This is even better than I thought.
Alakay, turn around!
No, Pop, it's hop, shuffle, ball change, hip swish, turn around.
Oh, no.
Alakay!
Are you hurt?
Yeah, I am.
Did I... did I win?
No, son.
How could this happen?
You told us you were a king.
A king does not get beat.
I am a king.
I'm the King of New York.
It's my stage name.
Like for when I perform.
Perform?
Oh, no, this is horrible!
Alakay has failed the test!
Who would have ever imagined that today Zuba would have to banish his own son?
Zuba, no.
Zuba, yes.
Sadly, the alpha lion must cast out all failures.
Then I'm no longer the alpha lion.
Dad, what are you doing?
Dad, no!
You can't do this.
Who could possibly take Zuba's place?
Anyone?
Someone?
No one?
You, sir!
I guess not.
Well, I... this is all very awkward, but I suppose I could carry this tremendous burden.
Teetsi!
Get the hat.
As your new leader, I hereby banish Alakay!
He shall wear this Hat of Shame and leave the watering hole for a thousand years, or life!
Whichever comes last.
Shoo, shoo!
Get out of here!
You should have told us you weren't a real king, son!
You never told me I'd have to fight anybody!
What did you expect?
!
I don't know!
Maybe a little fatherly advice like, "Hey, son, it's a fight!"
- You're a lion!
- But I never fought another lion!
No, I guess not.
You dance!
And other stuff!
Your pal, Makunga, set me up back there!
- None of this would have happened...
- If you were a real lion.
- Zuba!
- Yeah, I said it!
A real lion.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Saw.
Suture.
Swab.
You're in my light, Stephen.
You have a brown spot on your shoulder.
That's very observant, Stephen.
As you can see, I'm covered in brown spots.
OK!
That bone will be good as new in a few weeks.
So I don't have to pick out a dying hole?
No, you got your whole life ahead of you.
- Really?
- Go out and grab it by the horns.
- Thank you, Dr. Mankiewicz!
- Break a leg!
Sweet kid.
This spot looks like Witch Doctor's Disease.
Witch Doctor's Disease?
That's the most ridiculous disease I've ever heard of.
- Don't ask.
- Someone's been knotty.
This won't hurt a bit.
Joe, our last witch doctor, had a spot just like that.
- And?
- Monday, Joe.
Wednesday, no Joe.
Wednesday, no Joe?
I can breathe!
Thanks, doc!
So this Witch Doctor's Disease is a real thing?
You'll find a cure.
You've got at least 48 hours!
But I've never heard of it.
I mean...
I don't have any penicillin.
I'll need a CAT scan just to get started!
Have a lion look you over.
They'd be happy to.
Ta-da!
- He has talent.
- Stupendous and tremendous.
Hollah!
Bet you've never seen that one!
Knocked 'em dead in New York!
- Let's all give it a try!
- Let's do it!
Well, you can try all you want to, but it takes years of practice.
You'll never get a tight stream until you build up your lip muscles to the point where you can purse your lips like this.
You got it?
Ta-da!
How did you?
You guys got it right out of the box!
- If you can do it...
...we can do it.
It's in our blood!
I always thought I was a bit unique.
We are unique!
We are like a force of nature!
- A million points of light!
- And dark stripes!
Exactly the same!
Exactly the same.
Looks impressive, Kowalski, but will it fly?
Yes.
If we fold it here, here and here.
Nice.
Oh, man.
My dad thinks I'm a total loser.
I've ruined my parents' lives.
That is definitely not crack-a-lackin'.
It is lacking' in the cracking', my friend.
I've gotta fix this.
So there's...
There's something I gotta tell you.
Hey, guys.
Is this place great or what?
!
I'd go with "or what."
Well, I'll tell you what.
You're not gonna believe it, but I got a date with Moto Moto.
Who's Moto Moto?
Oh, he's so big and handsome and big!
- Know what "Moto Moto" means?
- Twins?
It means, "Hot Hot."
"Hot Hot"?
When did you start parlez-ing African?
It's in my blood.
Don't worry, you can flirt around with Mr. Hot Pants after I'm gone.
Melman, why am I the parade and you're the rain?
Why are you driving your parade under my rain?
Maybe I'll parade in another part of town!
Whoa, guys.
Main Street's mine!
Well, you can have it!
And you can take your hotee-tot float and Mr. Hotee Moto Moto...
- What are you talking about?
- What are we talking about?
Melman, just tell her.
What?
What are you...
I don't know what you're talking about.
I guess I'll go, then.
Don't bother.
- Don't get up on my account.
- Melman!
Gloria!
- I thought you guys were friends!
- Marty's absolutely right.
- Marty?
- Marty?
Marty?
What the heck is going on?
You're not?
Oh!
He was...
I thought he...
You're not him.
He's...
Oh.
You thought that guy was me?
No.
I mean, yes, you...
Guys, come on.
You thought I was him?
You guys kind of do look a little...
You look a lot alike.
Marty, you look a lot alike.
You laugh alike.
Talk alike.
He has the same speech pattern.
It's a little weird, really.
I mean, come on.
Marty.
So you're saying there's nothing unique about me.
I'm just like any other zebra.
No.
Of course you're different!
How?
OK, I can't tell you apart.
Maybe you could wear a bell or something.
- A bell?
!
- OK, not a bell.
Bell's a bad idea.
How about a T-shirt that says, "I'm with stupid"?
- I'm not stupid!
- Not you, stupid!
Him, stupid!
You know, while you've been doing the prancing pony with your new posse,
I've been having the worst day of my life.
It's always about you, isn't it?
My problems are just a little bit bigger than yours.
I couldn't tell you apart.
So what?
!
Yeah, fine.
Run away, Marty!
Run away!
That's what you do best!
Just like back in New York!
I'm right here.
But you can't tell that, right?
Your one-of-a-million friend hopes you enjoy your bigger-than-anyone-else's problems alone!
Good, leave!
I don't need you to help me solve my problems!
You're a dime a dozen!
I can't tell which one's Marty!
Which one's Marty?
Wait a minute.
Oh, yeah, I don't care!
Nice hat, you showoff!
Marty don't go.
Giddy-up, giddy-up!
Giddy-up, giddy-up!
Look, Maurice!
The perfect spot for my summer palace!
Please fill in all these holes and relocate the riff-raff.
- Who'd leave a perfectly good head?
- What a waste.
Tell me about it.
I'm in my prime here.
I'm terminal, you know?
I probably only have another two days left to live.
That's a bummer, man.
If I, King Julien... that's my name only had two days left to live,
I would do all the things
- I've ever dreamed of doing.
- Like what?
I'd love to become a professional whistler.
I'm pretty amazing at it now, but I want to get even better, make my living out of it.
You know what else I would do?
I would invade a neighboring country and impose my own ideology, even if they didn't want it!
Easy for you to say.
You're a king.
Yes.
And you are only just a sad little head.
There must be something you want to do before you die!
- There is this one thing.
- What?
Tell me.
- No, I couldn't.
- What is it?
I never told Gloria how I feel about her.
What is it?
Please tell me!
I never had the guts to tell Gloria how I feel about her.
How I've always felt about her.
Fine.
Don't tell me!
Is it a woman?
You didn't tell me it's a woman.
What are you afraid of?
You're a dead man anyway.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're right.
You've got to march right up to this woman.
Look her right in the eye.
Lean forward.
Just a little, or almost all the way.
Then you let her lean forward a little until you're just lips' distance away from each other.
Then you tell her how much you hate her.
Actually, it's more like love her.
Oh, you sly dog!
Woof, woof!
You're a real player.
Now listen to me.
You got to rise up.
You hearing me?
- He didn't hear you.
- I can't hear you!
- You got to rise up!
- Rising up!
- Get out of the hole!
- I'm rising out of the ground!
- He's rising, Maurice.
- I'm rising, Maurice!
- Rising!
- You go right up to this woman!
Do you feel it?
- Go up to her face!
- Tell the truth!
- I'm going to tell her!
- Then you say, "Baby, I dig you!"
Yeah!
I'm going to do it!
I'm going to do it!
I love that happy little head.
She love
Moto Moto
She love
Moto Moto
She loves me She loves my eyes
She loves me She loves my thighs
She loves my roundness
She love that I'm chunky She love that I'm plumpy
She love my heftiness She love my zestiness
She love me restlessly She love me forever
She love me 'cause she love me
Moto Moto before things get too serious, well,
I was wondering, if I were to, for example, stay here I'd like to ask you...
Let your candied lips be the messengers to my... ear canal.
I have so many questions.
I promise the answer will always be yes.
Unless no is required.
So what is it about me that you find so interesting?
You're the most plumpenest girl I've ever met.
OK.
Other than that.
Let's see.
Yeah, well, you know... you chunky.
Right.
My gosh, girl, you huge.
You said that.
Yeah, that's right.
We don't have to talk no more.
Gloria!
Gloria.
Melman.
Melman, I want you to meet Moto Moto.
Moto Moto.
Yeah, nice to meet you.
- I guess I...
- It's OK, Melman.
Apology accepted.
Oh.
Yeah, right, that.
That's why I...
Good.
OK.
Well, that's it, then.
Good.
We're kind of busy here, man.
No.
No, that's not it.
Listen, Mototo, you better treat this lady like a queen.
Because you, my friend, you found yourself the perfect woman.
If I was ever so lucky to find the perfect woman,
I'd give her flowers every day.
And not just any flowers.
OK?
Her favorites are orchids.
White.
And breakfast in bed.
Six loaves of wheat toast, butter on both sides.
No crust, the way she likes it.
I'd be her shoulder to cry on and her best friend.
I'd spend every day thinking of how to make her laugh.
She has the most amazing laugh.
That's what I would do if I were you.
But I'm not, so you do it.
OK.
What?
That was beautiful.
Anyways, where were we?
I'm "huge"?
Surprised to see me, Makunga?
Well, I'm here to set things straight, like a real lion!
Is this real enough for you?
How about this?
This is for setting me up!
This is for stealing my dad's job!
This is for humiliating my family!
And making me look like a fool!
Had enough?
Sure, fly away!
Coward.
The water.
It's gone.
It's never gone dry before.
- We'll need a lot more dying holes.
- How could this happen?
Out of my way!
What is going on here?
!
The watering hole is dry!
There's barely water for one of us!
- Good observation, Shirley.
- I'm Bobby.
Makunga, what do we do?
Quiet!
Listen up!
I'm afraid there is only one solution to this horrible crisis:
We'll all have to fight for it.
- We can't fight for it.
- That's crazy.
That's not fair.
You'd win!
Exactly, Shirley.
I'm Bob...
Sorry, folks, but life isn't fair.
I'm in charge now, thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion.
Please, Makunga, this is the only water on the reserve.
If you're thirsty, you'll have to look for water off the reserve.
- Off the reserve?
- It's too dangerous!
Hunters would shoot us!
No one leaves the reserve and survives!
I left the reserve!
And survived.
I can do something about this.
Looks like a clogged pipe, like we get in New York.
I'll travel upriver...
- Upriver?
- Off the reserve?
You?
Yeah.
I'll unclog the pipe and bring back your water.
Great!
I'd help you pack, but by the looks of that hat, I see you're all set!
Fine.
Go ahead, laugh.
Laugh your mane off.
I'll prove you wrong.
Maybe you should try a little rain dance.
Zuba would know what to do.
- Where's Zuba?
- You don't care about us.
Zuba should be in charge, not you.
All right, fine!
As an added measure, I will consult with Zuba!
Marty?
Hey!
Marty!
Marty?
Marty.
Where'd you get the fruity hat?
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
Hi.
Is Marty in there?
Anyone seen Marty?
Which one of us is Marty?
All right.
Well, if you see him, tell him his friend Alex came to say goodbye.
Goodbye?
Don't go.
Where are you going?
- Can we come?
- No.
I have to do this alone.
You can't leave the reserve!
What are you doing?
- They'll get your hat.
- Hunters are everywhere!
Could you leave the hat?
Marty!
I know you're in there.
Before I go, I got something I want to say.
You've been a great friend.
You've helped me so often to see the bright side of my problems that I never think of you having any.
I wasn't there for you when you needed me.
Just like back at the zoo.
What kind of friend does that make me?
A pretty lousy friend, I guess.
I just want you to know that I...
You're one in a million.
This is touching.
It is touching.
So could you turn around so I can tell you to your face?
That's right.
Gotcha!
I see you in there!
Yeah, you.
You, right there.
Twelfth row, two hundred and third from the left.
That's you, Marty.
I know it's you.
Know what makes you special?
These guys are white with black stripes.
You're black with white stripes.
You're a dreamer, Marty.
Always have been.
You have great taste in music and horrible taste in friends.
Well, not Melman and Gloria, but me.
OK, I'm in.
Marty, you can't come with me.
You don't have a choice.
- People are out there!
- You're crazy!
Come back!
The people will get you!
Don't lose the hat!
Bye, hat!
Any water?
No, just more diamonds and gold.
Don't give up hope.
Listen up!
I will help you!
There's only one way to get your precious water.
I, your beloved King Julien must simply make a small sacrifice to my good friends, the water gods, in the volcano!
What does that do?
What does that do?
Excellent question.
My sacrifice goes in the volcano.
The friendly gods eat up my sacrifice.
"Thank you for the sacrifice."
"Here, have another." "No, I've had enough."
"I'll be insulted unless you have another."
"I don't want another sacrifice!"
"Look at you!
You're skinny!" "No!
I've had enough!"
The gods eat the sacrifice.
They are grateful.
They give me some water, and then I give it to you.
What?
Does it work?
No!
I mean, yes.
Well, Maurice?
Ah, it's fifty-fifty.
We'll do it!
Excellent!
Now all I need is someone who would like to go into the volcano and get eaten by gods.
Any hands!
Hands, anybody!
I need someone, perhaps who has never found love, who could look death straight in the eyeball.
A real, genuine hero.
- I'll do it.
- Melman?
Hurry up!
Before we all come to our senses!
Melman, what is wrong with you?
I'm dying anyway.
If there's a chance it'll get you water, it's worth it.
Are you nuts?
I want you to know, back at the zoo, it was never the doctors or prescriptions that kept me going.
It was always you.
Seeing you every day.
That's what kept me going.
Melman!
Wait!
Melman!
Melman!
Melman!
You going to mope like this all day?
Don't "hmph" me.
Listen, Zuba.
A miracle happened.
Our son came back to us.
How come that is not good enough for you?
What are you saying, woman?
We lost him once, Zuba.
Let's not lose him again.
Zuba!
- Zuba!
- Get out of here!
What do you want?
It's awful.
The watering hole is dried up.
Dried up?
That's impossible!
There's nothing left!
You're alpha lion, Makunga.
What are you gonna do about it?
Your son, Alakay, he said he could fix it.
He's gone upriver.
- Off the reserve?
!
- No!
I tried to stop him.
I told him it was suicide.
He was determined to prove himself to you.
You stay here, in case he comes back!
Hurry, Zuba!
I'm so parched.
Is this place starting to freak you out?
We'll slip in, find the problem.
Hunters will never know we were here.
Why are we doing this?
Maybe my dad will think I'm...
I want to show him I'm a real lion.
As opposed to a chocolate lion.
I know this may sound hard to believe, but apparently, lions don't dance.
What?
!
As far as my dad is concerned.
As far as people are concerned, you're a hit.
In New York.
This is Africa...
much tougher crowd.
Marty, this is it!
This is the clog!
Come on.
Well, there's the water.
Stay down.
Look at that.
Knit one, purl two.
It's her.
- Is this right?
- Very good.
Nana, slow down.
You're a little tangled, aren't you?
No, don't pull.
I'll do it.
We need dynamite.
Got any?
Oh, snap!
I just used my last stick this morning!
- Savages!
- Evasive maneuvers!
- Serpentine, serpentine!
- Squiggly squid maneuver!
Zag, zig-zag, zig ziggy zag!
No, no!
Squiggly squid!
Etch A Sketch!
That's too complex!
Octopus, octopus!
- Run, Marty!
- I can't leave you here!
Go get help!
Squiggly squid maneuver!
Go!
Go!
Squiggly squid!
Etch A Sketch!
Etch A Sketch!
Save us We love you
OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- Save us
- Melman
- We love you
- Melman
Save us
OK, here we go.
OK, OK.
- Melman
- We love you
- Melman
- Save us
Here we go!
Here we go!
- What's all the hoopla about?
- Joe?
Joe the Witch Doctor?
We thought you were dead!
So did I. Then I realized I'm covered in brown spots.
So Melman's not dying!
- Melman's not dying!
- Oh, no!
Melman!
Move!
Don't do this!
Julien, stop this!
This is crazy!
Oh, suddenly throwing a giraffe into a volcano to make water is crazy!
Yes!
- Please, Melman!
Stop!
- Gloria?
- You can't do this!
- Why not?
Because...
You can't do this, Melman.
First, that hurts.
Second, I've only got 18 hours to live, anyway.
Melman, I gotta know did you mean those things you said about me?
Of course I did.
- That's crazy.
- It is?
It's crazy to think I had to go halfway around the world to find out the perfect guy for me lived right next door.
Then it's you and me, neighbor.
You and me for the next 18 hours.
I'll take whatever you got.
- Maurice, what happened?
- I believe the fat lady has sung.
- What's going on here?
- Marty!
Alex is in big trouble!
We got to get upriver fast!
- What about the plane?
- Perfect!
Come on!
The plane won't be fixed until the suits meet our demands.
Now, maternity leave.
Maternity leave?
You're all males.
We need that plane for a rescue mission.
There's nothing I can do until we bust up this union.
I'll bust up all of you if you don't get this plane going.
Can't you see these commies have my hands tied?
No maternity leave.
Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want these blowing around on the savanna.
All right.
You get your maternity leave.
Finally.
Where we headed?
What's going on?
Where are we going?
Oh, no!
Please!
Don't put me there!
No!
This is wrong.
You see?
You are survivors.
Now, how about a nice lion casserole?
You can't eat a lion.
Don't worry, it tastes like chicken.
No, no, no.
Don't listen to her.
She's out of her mind, people!
I'm from New York City!
It's me, Alex the lion!
From Central Park!
Dad!
What were you thinking, son?
You got no business being out here!
Stay behind me.
They're New Yorkers.
They're just rude and frightened people.
Stay back!
You'd let your dinner get away?
- What are you doing?
- The only thing I know how to do.
What the heck?
Hey, I know those moves.
Alex?
- It's Alex the lion!
- From Central Park!
It is Alex!
Only one lion can move like that!
He's beautiful.
I can't believe it.
How does he do that?
What are you doing?
I'm dancing with my son!
I think.
Don't think, Dad.
Feel!
Butterfly!
I'm feeling it!
I'm feeling it!
Roar!
That was beautiful.
Now let's eat!
Dad, look out!
What the...
Alex!
Get in!
She's got a gun!
Get out while we can!
- What?
- She's got a gun!
Get out while we can!
Pass it on!
He said let's have some fun and take out the dam.
Basset hound.
Skipper!
Alex wants to take out the dam.
All right!
But it's his funeral.
- Hard to port!
- Aye-aye, Skippy!
Bring it on!
Bring it on!
Come back!
That's my dinner!
Kowalski, full throttle.
Music!
- I like this song.
- It never gets old.
It does have a catchy hook.
Come about!
Bring her in low!
Hold onto your skirts!
It's dam-busting time!
Hold on tight, baby!
Here we go!
Tell them no!
Pull up!
They'll kill us!
There's got to be another way!
Pass it on!
They say no pull up.
Kill us.
There's no other way.
Basset hound.
Are you sure?
Men, there is no sacrifice greater than someone else's.
No!
Medic!
Ramming speed!
Bring it on!
Bad kitties.
I don't know why the sacrifice didn't work.
The science seemed so solid.
I'd jump right in that volcano if I wasn't so good at whistling.
It's you!
I found you!
Mort?
Bad fishy!
I wonder if the gods like seafood.
Let's find out.
Look, Maurice.
- That was quick.
- I did it!
I did it!
I did it!
OK, you did it!
Oh, yes!
Look!
- It's Alakay!
- It's Zuba!
You did it!
Alakay, Zuba, you did it!
Zuba!
Alakay!
You're back!
I'm so glad you're safe!
Out of my way.
Well, well, well.
You know, Zuba, if I remember correctly, you quit the pride.
And you were kicked out.
So don't think that this changes anything.
You're right.
In fact, we humbly present you with this token of appreciation.
A man bag.
Very popular where I'm from.
- Don't know what to say.
- Still be tough and carry your stuff.
Does the strap adjust?
This will go very nicely for me when I go out hiking.
But you're still banished.
We figured you'd say that.
My handbag!
You bad kitty!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
You deserve this, son.
Welcome to the pride.
Thanks, Dad.
But this belongs to you.
No, son.
To us!
My son!
The King of New York!
That's my baby!
Love transcends all differences.
We are gathered here today to celebrate such a love.
Do you take each other, for better or for worse?
For better, please.
What a beautiful, weird couple!
That's not going to last.
Can I kiss the bride?
No!
Music!
- Struts.
- Check.
- Flaps!
- Check.
- Diamonds and gold.
- Check.
- Bye-bye!
- We'll miss you!
See you later!
We'll be back after the honeymoon in Monte Carlo, or whenever the gold runs out.
Come back soon!
Mom, let them take their time.
New York isn't going anywhere, right, guys?
You're right about that!
As long as I'm with her and you two, I don't care where we are.
She has the most amazing laugh.
Love has no boundaries!
Looks like you're stuck with us for a while.
Dad?
What's wrong?
I just thought we could hang out a bit and...
- You got me!
- I got you, son!
You got me with my thing.
You brought it back around on me.
I got you, son!
The old man's not too bad, eh, Marty?
- Marty?
Who's Marty?
- Come on.
- I don't know no Marty.
- You can't fool me.
Ain't no Marty here.
Marty!
I can look into your eyes, and I know it's you.
See, I've been traveling Been traveling forever
But now that I found a home feels like I'm in heaven
See, I've been traveling Been traveling forever
But now that I'm home
Hey!
Shake the hot things!
Shake the hot things!
Shake 'em!
Shake 'em!
Shake 'em!
Subtitles by LeapinLar
Well done, boys.
Looks like ice-cold sushi for breakfast.
No, no, son.
Over here.
See the lion?
Look at the lion and get the lion.
Now, son, if you're gonna grow up... and be like your daddy someday, you gotta learn how to fight.
Da-da.
Now, Alakay, let me show you something, OK?
You see this mark?
You and me are the same.
When you're bigger, you'll be Alpha Lion, just like me.
Now let me see you fight.
Ready?
No, Alakay.
No dancing!
You just amuse yourself, don't you?
You're a strange kid.
You're a strange one.
I'm...
Now, come on, let's try it again.
No, Alakay.
Stop that right now.
Doggone it!
It's so disappointing when they don't grow up the way you want.
Makunga.
You're not challenging me again, are you?
Look on the bright side.
After i defeat you and become alpha lion, you'll have more time to spend with your pathetic son.
Before i kick your butt, let me ask you:
Why do you want to become the alpha lion?
I'm better looking, i have better hair, i'm deceivingly smart and i want everyone else to do what i say.
We fight on three.
One...
Pay attention, Alakay.
Daddy will show you how it's done.
Two, three!
- Who's the alpha lion?
- You are.
Don't you forget it.
And that, Alakay, is how you attack...
Alakay?
That's it.
Here, kitty, kitty.
This one's a beauty.
He'll be worth a few bucks.
It just gets easier and easier.
Daddy!
Alakay!
Alakay!
Alakay!
Da-da!
No!
No!
No!
Alakay!
- Daddy!
- Daddy's got you!
Hold on!
Da-da!
Alakay!
Daddy!

- i don't like the looks of this guy.
- He's kind of cute.
He's kind of a showoff.
You think he's cute?
Roar!
The King of New York City Alex the Lion!
I still think he's kind of a showoff.
The guy's an animal.
Maybe he should take a break.
You know, we could all use a vacation.
Come on, where would we go on vacation?
I don't know about you, but i want to go to Connecticut!
On the loose, several animals, including the world famous Alex the Lion, escaped from the Central Park Zoo tonight.
The escapees were cornered in Grand Central Station.
He was a very bad kitty.
Animal rights activists, who convinced zoo officials... to have the animals sent to Africa, were stunned to learn that the freighter carrying the animals... was reported missing today.
Tonight, hundreds of New Yorkers have gathered at the zoo... to mourn the loss of their beloved zoo animals.
The question on everyone's mind, where are they now?
I like to move it, move it
He likes to move it, move it
She likes to move it, move it
- We like to
- Move it!
Come on!
Y'all know this one!
It never gets stale!
- We like to
- Move it!
We'll miss you little fuzz buckets!
You've been a great crowd!
Glad we could introduce you to the toilet.
If you ever come look us up in Manhattan, feel free to call first.
Seriously though, call.
OK?
Settle down, everybody.
Be quiet!
You can't leave without this!
Surprise, freaks!
Shake it!
Shake it.
Look, i'm a lady!
I'm a lady, everyone!
I'm a lady!
Not really!
It's me, King Julien!
Which of you is attracted to me?
Hands up!
Hey, freaks!
You will be very glad to hear that i am coming with you.
Oh, no, thank you.
Yes, thank you.
It's my plane!
Until i return with the spoils from the new country Stevie will be in charge!
I don't think they like that idea.
What are you saying, Stevie?
No.
Could we...?
No, you didn't say that!
How is that even possible?
Naughty little thing!
Stevie says...
Let them eat cake!
King Julien, wait for me!
I'm all packed!
I have a whole itinerary planned!
Oh, no!
It's Mort!
He's so annoying!
Don't let him on.
Stop that thing!
He's carrying scissors and hand cream!
Everybody in!
Quickly, get in, get in!
Get in quick!
- Struts.
- Check.
- Flaps.
- Check.
- Engine.
Coffee maker.
- Check.
You guys!
Oopsie-daisy!
That has to be the second biggest slingshot i've ever seen.
But it'll have to do.
Attention.
This is your captain speaking.
In the event of an emergency, place the vest over your head... then kiss your... good-bye.
New York City, here we come!
Pray to your personal God this hunk of junk flies.
Personal God, hunk...?
What?
We are go, sir.
Open the door!
I'm outside!
If cabin pressure is lost, place the mask over your face to hide your terrified expression.
Miss, aren't these supposed to be attached to my seat?
- No, sir.
- OK, boys, launch!
Launch!
- Launch!
- Launch!
Gremlin!
Hey, Mort.
Hi!
That was weird.
- Somebody's dreaming.
- I think i saw Mort on the plane wing.
You got Madagascar on the brain.
I know i'm gonna miss it.
It was incredible.
I think it'll seem more fun the further we are from it.
Like when you bit me on the butt?
I'm gonna take that thing you're holding onto and use it onstage.
It's all part of my little actor's salad bar of emotional tidbits.
Are the butts next to the croutons?
You don't need to be sarcastic.
When we get back, i might sign up for the breeding program.
Breeding program?
We reach a point when we want to meet somebody.
Settle down, have a relationship.
I can see that.
What?
Like dating?
Yeah, dating.
Other... other guys?
What do you mean, other guys?
Darn it!
What is holding up that beverage service?
!
I'm gonna go check.
You all keep talking.
I'm gonna catch a few winks.
It's so funny!
I like laughing!
It's such a nice experience!
To laugh!
Do you mind going back?
This is first class.
It's nothing personal.
We're just better than you.
Maurice, i'm open!
Hit me!
- He shoots, he scores!
- Is that Vivaldi?
- In-flight slave.
- Can i help you, Mr. Mankiewicz?
Bring my nuts on a silver platter.
We were checking on our drink order.
Sorry.
Been a little backed up.
- I guess i'll go back...
- Where's your body?
You're freaking me out!
Can you please go over there, please?
What happened to the separation of the classes?
I'm sure this democracy thing is just a fad.
We'll go out for pineapple, my bobbly-headed boobly-boo.
Skipper, look.
Analysis.
Looks like a small bulb used to indicate something unusual, like a malfunction.
I find it pretty and somewhat hypnotic.
That too, sir.
Right!
Rico?
Manual!
Problemo solved.
- We may be out of fuel.
- Why do you think so?
We've lost engine one and engine two is no longer on fire.
Buckle up, boys.
Don't look, doll.
This might get hairy.
Attention!
This is your captain.
I have good and bad news.
The good news is, we're landing immediately.
The bad news is, we're crash-landing.
When it comes to air travel, we know you have no choice.
But thanks for choosing Air Penguin.
Raise your arms, Maurice!
It's more fun when you raise your arms!
I can fly!
This could be it, Marty!
I want you to know you are a one-in-a-million friend!
Thanks, buddy!
You're the best ever!
- And you won't mind when i tell you...
- Tell me anything!
I broke your iPod!
The buttons were so small!
It made me mad!
- The horror!
- I'm sorry!
- I'll kill you, butt-biter!
- It was an accident!
- An accident!
- Butt-biter!
I love you, Gloria!
I always have!
Like you love the beach.
Or a good book.
Or the beach.
Goodness, doll, you're shaking like a leaf.
Rico, you've had your fun.
Pull up.
Gear down.
Gently.
You just want to kiss the ground.
Just a peck, a smooch, like you'd kiss your sister.
I said, kiss it!
Now just a little brake.
Just a touch.
I believe that's checkmate.
Commence emergency landing procedure.
Flaps up!
Deploy!
Oh, we're here.
What in the world?
What happened to the plane?
What did y'all do to the plane?
I'm OK.
I'm alive.
I can't even sleep for a minute.
This is not JFK.
Kowalski, casualty report.
Two passengers unaccounted for.
That's a number i can live with.
Good landing, boys.
Who says a penguin can't fly?
Hey, happy slappers!
Is there some reason to celebrate?
Look at the plane!
- We'll fix it.
- How are you gonna fix this?
Grit, spit and a whole lot of duct tape.
We should be up and running in, say, six to nine months.
- Sixty-nine months?
!
- No, six to nine months.
Kowalski, i say we use this setback to our advantage.
- Where'd you get that number?
- I want you to reconfigure the design.
How do you estimate that?
Pretty boy!
Why don't you and your friends dig a latrine.
Hold on.
Who made you king of the plane wreck?
Excuse me?
Fine.
You can be in charge.
You fix the plane.
Who gives you the authority to put me in charge?
OK, then i'll remain in charge.
Yeah, you will remain in charge.
You and your hippie friends stay out of our hair.
Correcto-mundo.
Because i decided to.
- Good for you.
- Well, this discussion isn't over.
Higher mammals!
Stay with us.
We could use your front cortexes and opposable thumbs.
Phil!
I should wash your hands out with soap.
How in the hell-o will they fix this plane?
!
You know, grit and spit and spit.
A lot of spit and grit and stick-to-it-iveness.
That don't sound too promising.
You're right.
We're stuck here.
As long as we're together, we'll be OK.
Yeah, but love ain't gonna get us home.
Behold!
The lion!
- People!
- There is much to see.
Moving on.
Wait, wait, wait!
People!
- They'll help us!
- Wait up!
- People!
Stop!
- help us!
If you stop, i'll autograph those!
I know you!
You.
It's the bad kitty.
How do you like some of that?
!
Come in, Tokyo!
Right in the batteries.
You think an old lady can't take care of herself?
Next time, i won't go so easy on you!
Thank you, dear.
Moving on!
Are you out of your mind?
We need help and you harass old ladies?
!
Out of my mind?
Who's out of my mind now?
- See if you can get an operator.
- No problem.
Out of my mind.
We're going home.
Message E-4.
The service user has roamed outside the coverage area.
please try again later.
Am i tripping?
all those zebras...
like me.
- Where are we?
- San Diego.
This time i'm 40 percent sure.
- I know this place.
- I think it's Africa.
Africa?
It's got to be.
Our ancestral crib.
It's in our blood.
I can feel it!
No, it's more than that.
It's like déjà vu, like i've been here before.
It's like Roots!
No, it's like déjà vu, like i've been here before.
How!
How!
Me Alex!
Me and me friends fly, fly in great metal bird.
Then plummet!
Smash ground!
Go boom!
Then here we emerge.
We offer only happiness... and good greetings.
Is he dancing about a plane crash?
Yeah.
We just... yeah.
I thought...
Sorry.
You came from off the reserve?
Way off.
From the Central Park Zoo, actually.
Don't strain yourself.
What's going on here?
They say they're from off the reserve.
That's impossible.
Only people come from off the reserve.
You look familiar.
Do i know you?
How could you survive the hunters?
We didn't see any hunters.
- What are you looking at?
- Me?
Nothing.
This watering hole doesn't need any more mouths to feed.
So skedaddle back to where you came from.
Is there a manager we could talk to?
I see.
You're here to challenge me!
What?
No!
No.
That's what it looks like to me!
Zuba!
Wait.
I'm trying to take care of business...
Yeah, yeah, Zuba.
Hold on.
Alakay?
Is that you?
No, it's Alex.
Ix.
Like New York Knicks.
Zuba, look!
I've always had that.
The vet checked it out.
It's kind of a beauty spot, really.
A mark.
all right, this is a little weird.
Honey, he's come home.
What?
You've come home.
Son.
Dad.
Mom and Dad?
Mom and Dad!
Mom and Dad!
It's my mom and dad!
I got a mom and dad!
My baby's alive!
Dad!
My son!
My son is home!
Alakay!
Alakay has come home!
Alakay!
Yeah!
The prodigal son returns.
This is perfect!
I thought you hated Zuba.
No, i do.
I do.
I do.
I hate him.
Oh, i do.
And i'm going to use Alakay, yes.
I'm going to use him to get rid of Zuba once and for all!
Giddy-up, feathered horse!
Make way!
Move out of the way!
Stand aside!
New York!
It's a bit of a dump.
Are you sure we're not in New Jersey?
Hello, New Yorkers!
Your new king is here!
This calls for a celebration!
Maurice, i think they like me.
You've got to love a non-hostile takeover!
Chukka-chukka what?
Excuse me.
I'm Marty.
I'm kind of new around here.
Hey, Marty!
You're a good-looking group!
You like to run?
Yeah.
Running is crack-a-lacking.
That's right!
Crack-a-lacking.
You guys speak my crack-a-lacking language.
What?
You don't have doctors here?
Not anymore.
Well, what if you catch a cold?
We go over to the dying holse and we die.
You guys really need a doctor.
- We have an opening.
- Would you be interested?
Me?
A doctor?
It's raining men.
Hallelujah!
You all got it going on.
Why don't you have a man?
You got worms?
Oh, i got rid of those.
Listen, girls.
Manhattan is short on two things, parking and hippos.
Hey, everybody!
I just found out that my son... is a doggone king!
The King of New York!
Show me some of your moves, son.
Don't be bashful.
all right.
This one always knocks them dead.
Roar!
Look out.
The King is mad.
The King is mad!
Let's welcome him back into the pride with open arms!
Welcome to the herd, Marty!
Me?
I've always wanted to be part of a herd!
- It's one for all...
- And all for all, y'all!
How do i look?
Technically, a traditional witch doctor has a bone through his nose.
Don't worry... it's just a clip-on.
Voilà!
He's a witch doctor!
My mother will be so happy.
Look out!
I think Moto Moto likes you.
Here he comes.
I like them big i like them chunky i like them big i like them plumpy i like them round With something' something
They like my sound They think i'm funky
Goodness, girl... you huge.
Who's your friend?
Or is that your butt?
You as quick as you are hefty.
So you're Moto Moto?
The name's so nice, you say it twice.
I kind of like it, fatso.
I'll see you around, girl.
It won't be hard, because you so... plumpy.
Oops!
I hate to be a party pooper, Zuba, but some of the lions were wondering when you plan to banish your son.
- What are you talking about?
- It's nothing, really.
They're griping that Alakay never went through... the rite of passage, blah, blah, blah, so technically speaking, he can't be a member of the pride.
It's nonsense.
I forgot about the rite of passage.
What is it?
What's this rite of passage?
A traditional coming-of-age ceremony.
Young lions earn their manes by demonstrating their skills.
- A show-of-skill talent show deal?
- Yeah.
Strutting their stuff.
A performance!
I think that's up my alley.
If it's tradition, i want to do it.
Strut my stuff.
Earn my mane.
I want to be Alaki.
- Alakay.
- Alakay!
Even better.
We will hold the rite of passage in the morning!
That's wonderful!
Good luck, Alakay.
Where i'm from, we say, "Break a leg. "
That's my boy!
I'm a private dancer
A dancer for money
Any old music will do
Beautiful, isn't it?
It's amazing.
Guys this is where we belong.
Operation Tourist Trap is a go.
Oh, i like that one.
It works on many levels.
You guys are a bunch of suck-ups.
- That, too.
- Absolutely.
Stations.
Stage one.
Go!
Oh, no!
What have i done?
Come on, take the bait.
- What happened?
- Oh, look at the poor little guy.
Is it dead?
Stage two!
Go, go, go!
I will give him the kiss of life.
Rico!
Rico!
Reverse!
Gas!
Music!
No!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Come back!
What is all this rock'n'roll racket?
!
Is she dead?
No!
You hoodlums!
Good heavens!
Are you OK?
Lady, i found your pocketbook.
My handbag.
Such a good boy.
Nana can't survive without it.
You are one tough cookie.
Brownies Troop 416, Yonkers.
OK, nobody panic!
The best thing we can do is stay together.
We'll wait for another tour jeep.
It may take hours, but...
Where are you going?
I'm not staying here to be attacked by more animals!
I'm too old to die.
I'm going with her. old lady, wait up!
please!
We need to stay together.
Fine!
We'll go that way!
Does anyone want a hard candy?
- Easy now.
- Watch your step.
And right here...
OK, are you ready?
This is where you always slept.
Oh, man!
- Was this mine?
- Look at you.
Look at him.
Oh, this thing.
Look, look!
- I remember this!
- He remembers.
A little harder than...
You never slept on the right end.
You always slept on the bottom end.
Is that...?
Is that my...?
Is that me?
You had the cutest little paws.
Little, little bitty oi' paws.
You did that the day we lost you.
Wow.
I was so young.
What happened to me?
It was all my fault.
I turned my back and... it was not your fault.
Your father did everything he could.
He tracked those hunters for weeks.
Far off the reserve.
Finally, i had to assume the hunters well...
We thought they'd killed you.
But my son fought them off!
Don't mess with the King of New York!
- That's right!
- Keep your chin in.
You boys be careful!
Watch out before you break something.
You used to call this "foofie. "
"Foofie"?
Foofie.
He doesn't want that.
This is my foofie!
Zuba, you better give him his foofie.
I mean, no, thank you, thank you.
It's perfect.
Son, you get your rest.
You have a big day tomorrow.
you'll need all your strength.
I will bring the house down for you.
I hope so.
Otherwise, your father will have to banish you.
Jeez, Mom, really?
I know you'll do us proud.
You know why?
You were born with it.
Good night, Alakay.
My boy.
My own boy.
My son's a king.
My son's a king.
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Alakay.
Foofie.
Look at foofie!
My foofie!
Foofie, foofie, foofie.
My foofie!
No sign of civilization.
Everybody appears very tired.
I think we're lost.
Nana, do you know where you're going?
No, but i'm going with a skip in my step and a smile on my face.
Sure, right, OK.
Yeah, all right.
- It's people.
- How did you get here?
- Can you help us?
We're lost.
- We're lost too.
It was awful.
A flash of black and white and they were gone.
They took the jeep!
- That happened to our jeep too!
- What do we do?
How will we all survive?
No food, no water, no shelter.
What are we gonna do?
!
You can let nature get the best of you, or you can get the best of nature.
Gather 'round, children.
We're New Yorkers, right?
Yeah.
We survive the concrete jungle!
When we need food, we hunt for a decent hot dog stand.
- Am i right?
- She's right.
When we need shelter, we build skyscrapers.
- Exactly!
- When we need water, we build a dam.
We're New Yorkers, for crying out loud!
If we can make it there, we can make it anywhere!
I'm coming, King Julien!
Bad fishy!
Bad fishy!
No, shark, no!
Sit!
Why am i laughing?
We have all the parts we need, but we're slightly behind schedule.
- How slightly?
- Six to nine years.
- Sixty-nine years?
- No, six to nine years.
Private!
What happened to our thumbs?
Haven't seen them since yesterday.
Darn you, Darwin!
Nobody goes AWOL on my watch.
Private!
You're coming with me.
Rico!
You're coming with me!
- We'll bring them in for court martial.
- That won't be necessary!
We've recruited a few extra thumbs for you, Skipper.
Well, i'll be a monkey's uncle.
Oh, i doubt that.
Enough lollygagging.
Let's get to work.
There'll be three groups.
Group alpha will do sheet metal fabrication.
Group Bronson handles assembly.
Group George Peppard, craft services.
Any questions?
Good!
Let's get to work.
I'd like to kiss you, monkey man.
all right, but you're so darn ugly.
Remember, little cub scouts, a great dance performance comes from the heart.
Straight from the heart, you'll never go wrong.
Sure, mister.
Hey, Alakay, i just happened to walk by, i thought i'd wish you luck.
- You're not nervous, are you?
- Nah, it's my thing.
In my opinion, the key to this is choosing the right competitor.
You mean, this is like a dance battle sort of thing?
- Like a dance-off?
- Sure.
Great.
I love that.
Freestyle.
Who'd be a good match for me?
Just to keep things interesting.
Well, i wish i could help, but that's strictly against our ancient tradition and all we hold sacred.
But if it was me out there...
i'd choose Teetsi.
Teetsi.
OK.
Sounds interesting.
Makunga, right?
Thank you.
Anything for Zuba's boy.
Go get them, tiger.
Shake it out.
A five, six, seven, eight.
Let's go, let's do this.
Let us begin the rite of passage ceremony.
- Come on, baby!
Make Mama proud!
- Woman, i'm trying to take...
On it, Mom!
Who will be the first participant?
Me!
Oh!
Me, me, me!
Me!
Me!
Me!
Me, me!
Please, me?
How about you?
The tall, handsome one.
Yeah.
Choose your opponent.
Let me see.
I guess i'll pick Teetsi?
Teetsi?
Why did he pick Teetsi?
That's my boy!
He's got some gumption there!
Somebody, wake him up!
all right, so, Teetsi, come on.
Let's do this, huh?
Come on, little tsetse fly.
Let's see your stuff.
Bring it.
- Let's dance!
- OK.
But let me warn you that i am a protégé of Fosse and Robbins!
Not "dance" dance!
Fight!
Dance fight!
You got it.
- Is he dancing?
- What's he doing?
I know that boy is not dancing.
This is even better than i thought.
Alakay, turn around!
No, Pop, it's hop, shuffle, ball change, hip swish, turn around.
Oh, no.
Alakay!
Are you hurt?
Yeah, i am.
Did i... did i win?
No, son.
How could this happen?
You told us you were a king.
A king does not get beat.
I am a king.
I'm the King of New York.
It's my stage name.
Like for when i perform.
Perform?
Oh, no, this is horrible!
Alakay has failed the test!
Who would have ever imagined that today Zuba would have to banish his own son?
Zuba, no.
Zuba, yes.
Sadly, the alpha lion must cast out all failures.
Then i'm no longer the alpha lion.
Dad, what are you doing?
Dad, no!
You can't do this.
Who could possibly take Zuba's place?
Anyone?
Someone?
No one?
You, sir!
I guess not.
Well, i... this is all very awkward, but i suppose i could carry this tremendous burden.
Teetsi!
Get the hat.
As your new leader, i hereby banish Alakay!
He shall wear this Hat of Shame and leave the watering hole... for a thousand years, or life!
Whichever comes last.
Shoo, shoo!
Get out of here!
You should have told us you weren't a real king, son!
You never told me i'd have to fight anybody!
What did you expect?
!
I don't know!
Maybe a little fatherly advice like, "Hey, son, it's a fight!"
- You're a lion!
- But i never fought another lion!
No, i guess not.
You dance!
And other stuff!
Your pal, Makunga, set me up back there!
- None of this would have happened...
- if you were a real lion.
- Zuba!
- Yeah, i said it!
A real lion.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Saw.
Suture.
Swab.
You're in my light, Stephen.
You have a brown spot on your shoulder.
That's very observant, Stephen.
As you can see, i'm covered in brown spots.
OK!
That bone will be good as new in a few weeks.
So i don't have to pick out a dying hole?
No, you got your whole life ahead of you.
- Really?
- Go out and grab it by the horns.
- Thank you, Dr. Mankiewicz!
- Break a leg!
Sweet kid.
This spot looks like Witch Doctor's Disease.
Witch Doctor's Disease?
That's the most ridiculous disease i've ever heard of.
- Don't ask.
- Someone's been knotty.
This won't hurt a bit.
Joe, our last witch doctor, had a spot just like that.
- And?
- Monday, Joe.
Wednesday, no Joe.
Wednesday, no Joe?
I can breathe!
Thanks, doc!
So this Witch Doctor's Disease is a real thing?
you'll find a cure.
You've got at least 48 hours!
But i've never heard of it.
I mean... i don't have any penicillin.
I'll need a OAT scan just to get started!
Have a lion look you over.
They'd be happy to.
Ta-da!
- He has talent.
- Stupendous and tremendous.
Hollah!
Bet you've never seen that one!
Knocked them dead in New York!
- Let's all give it a try!
- Let's do it!
Well, you can try all you want to, but it takes years of practice.
you'll never get a tight stream... until you build up your lip muscles to the point where you can... purse your lips like this.
You got it?
Ta-da!
How did you...?
You guys got it right out of the box!
- If you can do it...
... we can do it.
It's in our blood!
I always thought i was a bit unique.
We are unique!
We are like a force of nature!
- A million points of light!
- And dark stripes!
Exactly the same!
Exactly the same.
Looks impressive, Kowalski, but will it fly?
Yes.
If we fold it here, here and here.
Nice.
Oh, man.
My dad thinks i'm a total loser.
I've ruined my parents' lives.
That is definitely not crack-a-lacking.
It is lacking in the cracking, my friend.
I've gotta fix this.
So there's...
There's something i gotta tell you.
Hey, guys.
Is this place great or what?
!
I'd go with "or what. "
Well, i'll tell you what.
You're not gonna believe it, but i got a date with Moto Moto.
Who's Moto Moto?
Oh, he's so big and handsome and big!
- Know what "Moto Moto" means?
- Twins?
It means, "Hot Hot. "
"Hot Hot"?
When did you start parlez-ing African?
It's in my blood.
Don't worry, you can flirt around with Mr. Hot Pants after i'm gone.
Melman, why am i the parade and you're the rain?
Why are you driving your parade under my rain?
Maybe i'll parade in another part of town!
Whoa, guys.
Main Street's mine!
Well, you can have it!
And you can take your hotee-tot float and Mr. Hotee Moto Moto...
- What are you talking about?
- What are we talking about?
Melman, just tell her.
What?
What are you...
i don't know what you're talking about.
I guess i'll go, then.
Don't bother.
- Don't get up on my account.
- Melman!
Gloria!
- I thought you guys were friends!
- Marty's absolutely right.
- Marty?
- Marty?
Marty?
What the heck is going on?
You're not...?
Oh!
He was... i thought he...
You're not him.
He's...
Oh.
You thought that guy was me?
No.
I mean, yes, you...
Guys, come on.
You thought i was him?
You guys kind of do look a little...
You look a lot alike.
Marty, you look a lot alike.
You laugh alike.
Talk alike.
He has the same speech pattern.
It's a little weird, really.
I mean, come on.
Marty.
So you're saying there's nothing unique about me.
I'm just like any other zebra.
No.
Of course you're different!
How?
OK, i can't tell you apart.
Maybe you could wear a bell or something.
- A bell?
!
- OK, not a bell.
Bell's a bad idea.
How about a T-shirt that says, "i'm with stupid"?
- I'm not stupid!
- Not you, stupid!
Him, stupid!
You know, while you've been doing the prancing pony with your new posse, i've been having the worst day of my life.
It's always about you, isn't it?
My problems are just a little bit bigger than yours.
I couldn't tell you apart.
So what?
!
Yeah, fine.
Run away, Marty!
Run away!
That's what you do best!
Just like back in New York!
I'm right here.
But you can't tell that, right?
Your one-of-a-million friend hopes you enjoy... your bigger-than-anyone-eise's problems alone!
Good, leave!
I don't need you to help me solve my problems!
You're a dime a dozen!
I can't tell which one's Marty!
Which one's Marty?
Wait a minute.
Oh, yeah, i don't care!
Nice hat, you showoff!
Marty don't go.
Giddy-up, giddy-up!
Look, Maurice!
The perfect spot for my summer palace!
Please fill in all these holes and relocate the riff-raff.
- Who'd leave a perfectly good head?
- What a waste.
tell me about it.
I'm in my prime here.
I'm terminal, you know?
I probably only have another two days left to live.
That's a bummer, man.
If i, King Julien... that's my name only had two days left to live, i would do all the things...
- i've ever dreamed of doing.
- Like what?
I'd love to become a professional whistler.
I'm pretty amazing at it now, but i want to get even better, make my living out of it.
You know what else i would do?
I would invade a neighboring country... and impose my own ideology, even if they didn't want it!
Easy for you to say.
You're a king.
Yes.
And you are only just a sad little head.
There must be something you want to do before you die!
- There is this one thing.
- What?
tell me.
- No, i couldn't.
- What is it?
I never told Gloria how i feel about her.
What is it?
Please tell me!
I never had the guts to tell Gloria how i feel about her.
How i've always felt about her.
Fine.
Don't tell me!
Is it a woman?
You didn't tell me it's a woman.
What are you afraid of?
You're a dead man anyway.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're right.
You've got to march right up to this woman.
Look her right in the eye.
Lean forward.
Just a little, or almost all the way.
Then you let her lean forward a little until you're just lips' distance away from each other.
Then you tell her how much you hate her.
Actually, it's more like love her.
Oh, you sly dog!
Woof, woof!
You're a real player.
Now listen to me.
You got to rise up.
You hearing me?
- He didn't hear you.
- I can't hear you!
- You got to rise up!
- Rising up!
- Get out of the hole!
- I'm rising out of the ground!
- He's rising, Maurice.
- I'm rising, Maurice!
- Rising!
- You go right up to this woman!
Do you feel it?
- Go up to her face!
- tell the truth!
- I'm going to tell her!
- Then you say, "Baby, i dig you!"
Yeah!
I'm going to do it!
I'm going to do it!
I love that happy little head.
She love
Moto Moto
She love
Moto Moto
She loves me She loves my eyes
She loves me She loves my thighs
She loves my roundness
She love that i'm chunky She love that i'm plumpy
She love my heftiness She love my zestiness
She love me restlessly She love me forever
She love me 'cause she love me
Moto Moto before things get too serious, well, i was wondering, if i were to, for example, stay here i'd like to ask you...
Let your candied lips be the messengers to my... ear canal.
I have so many questions.
I promise the answer will always be yes.
Unless no is required.
So what is it about me that you find so interesting?
You're the most plumpenest girl i've ever met.
OK.
Other than that.
Let's see.
Yeah, well, you know... you chunky.
Right.
My gosh, girl, you huge.
You said that.
Yeah, that's right.
We don't have to talk no more.
Gloria!
Gloria.
Melman.
Melman, i want you to meet Moto Moto.
Moto Moto.
Yeah, nice to meet you.
- I guess i...
- it's OK, Melman.
Apology accepted.
Oh.
Yeah, right, that.
That's why i...
Good.
OK.
Well, that's it, then.
Good.
We're kind of busy here, man.
No.
No, that's not it.
Listen, Mototo, you better treat this lady like a queen.
Because you, my friend, you found yourself the perfect woman.
If i was ever so lucky to find the perfect woman, i'd give her flowers every day.
And not just any flowers.
OK?
Her favorites are orchids.
White.
And breakfast in bed.
Six loaves of wheat toast, butter on both sides.
No crust, the way she likes it.
I'd be her shoulder to cry on and her best friend.
I'd spend every day thinking of how to make her laugh.
She has the most amazing laugh.
That's what i would do if i were you.
But i'm not, so you do it.
OK.
What?
That was beautiful.
Anyways, where were we?
I'm "huge"?
Surprised to see me, Makunga?
Well, i'm here to set things straight, like a real lion!
Is this real enough for you?
How about this?
This is for setting me up!
This is for stealing my dad's job!
This is for humiliating my family!
And making me look like a fool!
Had enough?
Sure, fly away!
Coward.
The water.
It's gone.
It's never gone dry before.
- We'll need a lot more dying holes.
- How could this happen?
Out of my way!
What is going on here?
!
The watering hole is dry!
There's barely water for one of us!
- Good observation, Shirley.
- I'm Bobby.
Makunga, what do we do?
Quiet!
Listen up!
I'm afraid there is only one solution to this horrible crisis:
We'll all have to fight for it.
- We can't fight for it.
- That's crazy.
That's not fair.
You'd win!
Exactly, Shirley.
I'm Bob...
Sorry, folks, but life isn't fair.
I'm in charge now, thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion.
Please, Makunga, this is the only water on the reserve.
If you're thirsty, you'll have to look for water off the reserve.
- Off the reserve?
- It's too dangerous!
Hunters would shoot us!
No one leaves the reserve and survives!
I left the reserve!
And survived.
I can do something about this.
Looks like a clogged pipe, like we get in New York.
I'll travel upriver...
- Upriver?
- Off the reserve?
You?
Yeah.
I'll unclog the pipe and bring back your water.
Great!
I'd help you pack, but by the looks of that hat, i see you're all set!
Fine.
Go ahead, laugh.
Laugh your mane off.
I'll prove you wrong.
Maybe you should try a little rain dance.
Zuba would know what to do.
- Where's Zuba?
- You don't care about us.
Zuba should be in charge, not you.
all right, fine!
As an added measure, i will consult with Zuba!
Marty?
Hey!
Marty!
Marty?
Marty.
Where'd you get the fruity hat?
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
Hi.
Is Marty in there?
Anyone seen Marty?
Which one of us is Marty?
all right.
Well, if you see him, tell him his friend Alex came to say goodbye.
Goodbye?
Don't go.
Where are you going?
- Can we come?
- No.
I have to do this alone.
You can't leave the reserve!
What are you doing?
- They'll get your hat.
- Hunters are everywhere!
Could you leave the hat?
Marty!
I know you're in there.
Before i go, i got something i want to say.
You've been a great friend.
You've helped me so often to see the bright side of my problems... that i never think of you having any.
I wasn't there for you when you needed me.
Just like back at the zoo.
What kind of friend does that make me?
A pretty lousy friend, i guess.
I just want you to know that i...
You're one in a million.
This is touching.
It is touching.
So could you turn around so i can tell you to your face?
That's right.
Gotcha!
I see you in there!
Yeah, you.
You, right there.
Twelfth row, two hundred and third from the left.
That's you, Marty.
I know it's you.
Know what makes you special?
These guys are white with black stripes.
You're black with white stripes.
You're a dreamer, Marty.
always have been.
You have great taste in music... and horrible taste in friends.
Well, not Melman and Gloria, but me.
OK, i'm in.
Marty, you can't come with me.
You don't have a choice.
- People are out there!
- You're crazy!
Come back!
The people will get you!
Don't lose the hat!
Bye, hat!
Any water?
No, just more diamonds and gold.
Don't give up hope.
Listen up!
I will help you!
There's only one way to get your precious water.
I, your beloved King Julien... must simply make a small sacrifice to my good friends, the water gods, in the volcano!
What does that do?
What does that do?
Excellent question.
My sacrifice goes in the volcano.
The friendly gods eat up my sacrifice.
"Thank you for the sacrifice. "
"Here, have another. " "No, i've had enough. "
"I'll be insulted unless you have another. "
"I don't want another sacrifice!"
"Look at you!
You're skinny!" "No!
I've had enough!"
The gods eat the sacrifice.
They are grateful.
They give me some water, and then i give it to you.
What?
Does it work?
No!
I mean, yes.
Well, Maurice?
Ah, it's fifty-fifty.
We'll do it!
Excellent!
Now all i need is someone who would like to go into the volcano and get eaten by gods.
Any hands!
Hands, anybody!
I need someone, perhaps who has never found love, who could look death straight in the eyeball.
A real, genuine hero.
- I'll do it.
- Melman?
Hurry up!
Before we all come to our senses!
Melman, what is wrong with you?
I'm dying anyway.
If there's a chance it'll get you water, it's worth it.
Are you nuts?
I want you to know, back at the zoo, it was never the doctors or prescriptions that kept me going.
It was always you.
Seeing you every day.
That's what kept me going.
Melman!
Wait!
Melman!
Melman!
Melman!
You going to mope like this all day?
Don't "hmph" me.
Listen, Zuba.
A miracle happened.
Our son came back to us.
How come that is not good enough for you?
What are you saying, woman?
We lost him once, Zuba.
Let's not lose him again.
Zuba!
- Zuba!
- Get out of here!
What do you want?
It's awful.
The watering hole is dried up.
Dried up?
That's impossible!
There's nothing left!
You're alpha lion, Makunga.
What are you gonna do about it?
Your son, Alakay, he said he could fix it.
He's gone upriver.
- Off the reserve?
!
- No!
I tried to stop him.
I told him it was suicide.
He was determined to prove himself to you.
You stay here, in case he comes back!
Hurry, Zuba!
I'm so parched.
Is this place starting to freak you out?
We'll slip in, find the problem.
Hunters will never know we were here.
Why are we doing this?
Maybe my dad will think i'm... i want to show him i'm a real lion.
As opposed to a chocolate lion.
I know this may sound hard to believe, but apparently, lions don't dance.
What?
!
As far as my dad is concerned.
As far as people are concerned, you're a hit.
In New York.
This is Africa...
much tougher crowd.
Marty, this is it!
This is the clog!
Come on.
Well, there's the water.
Stay down.
Look at that.
Knit one, purl two.
It's her.
- Is this right?
- Very good.
Nana, slow down.
You're a little tangled, aren't you?
No, don't pull.
I'll do it.
We need dynamite.
Got any?
Oh, snap!
I just used my last stick this morning!
- Savages!
- Evasive maneuvers!
- Serpentine, serpentine!
- Squiggly squid maneuver!
Zag, zig-zag, zig ziggy zag!
No, no!
Squiggly squid!
Etch A Sketch!
That's too complex!
Octopus, octopus!
- Run, Marty!
- I can't leave you here!
Go get help!
Squiggly squid maneuver!
Go!
Go!
Squiggly squid!
Etch A Sketch!
Etch A Sketch!
Save us We love you
OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- Save us
- Melman
- We love you
- Melman
Save us
OK, here we go.
OK, OK.
- Melman
- We love you
- Melman
- Save us
Here we go!
Here we go!
- What's all the hoopla about?
- Joe?
Joe the Witch Doctor?
We thought you were dead!
So did i.
Then i realized i'm covered in brown spots.
So Melman's not dying!
- Melman's not dying!
- Oh, no!
Melman!
Move!
Don't do this!
Julien, stop this!
This is crazy!
Oh, suddenly throwing a giraffe into a volcano to make water is crazy!
Yes!
- Please, Melman!
Stop!
- Gloria?
- You can't do this!
- Why not?
Because...
You can't do this, Melman.
First, that hurts.
Second, i've only got 18 hours to live, anyway.
Melman, i gotta know did you mean those things you said about me?
Of course i did.
- That's crazy.
- It is?
It's crazy to think i had to go halfway around the world to find out the perfect guy for me... lived right next door.
Then it's you and me, neighbor.
You and me for the next 18 hours.
I'll take whatever you got.
- Maurice, what happened?
- I believe the fat lady has sung.
- What's going on here?
- Marty!
Alex is in big trouble!
We got to get upriver fast!
- What about the plane?
- Perfect!
Come on!
The plane won't be fixed until the suits meet our demands.
Now, maternity leave.
Maternity leave?
You're all males.
We need that plane for a rescue mission.
There's nothing i can do until we bust up this union.
I'll bust up all of you if you don't get this plane going.
Can't you see these commies have my hands tied?
No maternity leave.
Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want these blowing around on the savanna.
all right.
You get your maternity leave.
Finally.
Where we headed?
What's going on?
Where are we going?
Oh, no!
Please!
Don't put me there!
No!
This is wrong.
You see?
You are survivors.
Now, how about a nice lion casserole?
You can't eat a lion.
Don't worry, it tastes like chicken.
No, no, no.
Don't listen to her.
She's out of her mind, people!
I'm from New York City!
It's me, Alex the lion!
From Central Park!
Dad!
What were you thinking, son?
You got no business being out here!
Stay behind me.
They're New Yorkers.
They're just rude and frightened people.
Stay back!
You'd let your dinner get away?
- What are you doing?
- The only thing i know how to do.
What the heck?
Hey, i know those moves.
Alex?
- It's Alex the lion!
- From Central Park!
It is Alex!
only one lion can move like that!
He's beautiful.
I can't believe it.
How does he do that?
What are you doing?
I'm dancing with my son!
I think.
Don't think, Dad. feel!
Butterfly!
I'm feeling it!
I'm feeling it!
Roar!
That was beautiful.
Now let's eat!
Dad, look out!
What the...
Alex!
Get in!
She's got a gun!
Get out while we can!
- What?
- She's got a gun!
Get out while we can!
Pass it on!
He said let's have some fun and take out the dam.
Basset hound.
Skipper!
Alex wants to take out the dam.
all right!
But it's his funeral.
- Hard to port!
- Aye-aye, Skippy!
Bring it on!
Bring it on!
Come back!
That's my dinner!
Kowalski, full throttle.
Music!
- I like this song.
- It never gets old.
It does have a catchy hook.
Come about!
Bring her in low!
hold onto your skirts!
It's dam-busting time!
hold on tight, baby!
Here we go!
tell them no!
Pull up!
They'll kill us!
There's got to be another way!
Pass it on!
They say no pull up. kill us.
There's no other way.
Basset hound.
Are you sure?
Men, there is no sacrifice greater than someone else's.
No!
Medic!
Ramming speed!
Bring it on!
Bad kitties.
I don't know why the sacrifice didn't work.
The science seemed so solid.
I'd jump right in that volcano if i wasn't so good at whistling.
It's you!
I found you!
Mort?
Bad fishy!
I wonder if the gods like seafood.
Let's find out.
Look, Maurice.
- That was quick.
- I did it!
I did it!
I did it!
OK, you did it!
Oh, yes!
Look!
- It's Alakay!
- It's Zuba!
You did it!
Alakay, Zuba, you did it!
Zuba!
Alakay!
You're back!
I'm so glad you're safe!
Out of my way.
Well, well, well.
You know, Zuba, if i remember correctly, you quit the pride.
And you were kicked out.
So don't think that this changes anything.
You're right.
In fact, we humbly present you with this token of appreciation.
A man bag.
Very popular where i'm from.
- Don't know what to say.
- Still be tough and carry your stuff.
Does the strap adjust?
This will go very nicely for me when i go out hiking.
But you're still banished.
We figured you'd say that.
My handbag!
You bad kitty!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
You deserve this, son.
Welcome to the pride.
Thanks, Dad.
But this belongs to you.
No, son.
To us!
My son!
The King of New York!
That's my baby!
Love transcends all differences.
We are gathered here today to celebrate such a love.
Do you take each other, for better or for worse?
For better, please.
What a beautiful, weird couple!
That's not going to last.
Can i kiss the bride?
No!
Music!
- Struts.
- Check.
- Flaps!
- Check.
- Diamonds and gold.
- Check.
- Bye-bye!
- We'll miss you!
See you later!
We'll be back after the honeymoon in Monte Carlo, or whenever the gold runs out.
Come back soon!
Mom, let them take their time.
New York isn't going anywhere, right, guys?
You're right about that!
As long as i'm with her and you two, i don't care where we are.
She has the most amazing laugh.
Love has no boundaries!
Looks like you're stuck with us for a while.
Dad?
What's wrong?
I just thought we could hang out a bit and...
- You got me!
- I got you, son!
You got me with my thing.
You brought it back around on me.
I got you, son!
The old man's not too bad, eh, Marty?
- Marty?
Who's Marty?
- Come on.
- I don't know no Marty.
- You can't fool me.
Ain't no Marty here.
Marty!
I can look into your eyes, and i know it's you.
See, i've been traveling Been traveling forever
But now that i found a home feels like i'm in heaven
See, i've been traveling Been traveling forever
But now that i'm home
Hey!
Shake the hot things!
Shake the hot things!
Shake them!
Shake them!
Shake them!
Well done, boys.
Looks like ice-cold sushi for breakfast.
No, no, son.
Over here.
See the lion?
Look at the lion and get the lion.
Now, son, if you're gonna grow up and be like your daddy someday, you gotta learn how to fight.
Da-da.
Now, Alakay, let me show you something, OK?
You see this mark?
You and me are the same.
When you're bigger, you'll be Alpha Lion, just like me.
Now let me see you fight.
Ready?
No, Alakay.
No dancing!
You just amuse yourself, don't you?
You're a strange kid.
You're a strange one.
I'm...
Now, come on, let's try it again.
No, Alakay.
Stop that right now.
Doggone it!
It's so disappointing when they don't grow up the way you want.
Makunga.
You're not challenging me again, are you?
Look on the bright side.
After I defeat you and become alpha lion, you'll have more time to spend with your pathetic son.
Before I kick your butt, let me ask you:
Why do you want to become the alpha lion?
I'm better looking, I have better hair, I'm deceivingly smart and I want everyone else to do what I say.
We fight on three.
One...
Pay attention, Alakay.
Daddy will show you how it's done.
Two, three!
- Who's the alpha lion?
- You are.
Don't you forget it.
And that, Alakay, is how you attack...
Alakay?
That's it.
Here, kitty, kitty.
This one's a beauty.
He'll be worth a few bucks.
It just gets easier and easier.
Daddy!
Alakay!
Alakay!
Alakay!
Da-da!
No!
No!
No!
Alakay!
- Daddy!
- Daddy's got you!
Hold on!
Da-da!
Alakay!
Daddy!
I've been around the world in the pouring rain
Feeling out of place and feeling strange
Take me to a place where they know my name
'Cause I ain't met nobody that looks the same
I'm a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle
He's a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle
I'm a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle
He's a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle
I need my peoples, my peoples Take me to my peoples
Play that jungle fever Show 'em some love
Show love
Just gotta have someone Gotta have someone
To relate to, to relate to
I'm feeling right at home
Feeling right at home Feeling right at home
Feeling right at home I'm feeling right at home
See I been traveling Been traveling forever...
- I don't like the looks of this guy.
- He's kind of cute.
He's kind of a showoff.
You think he's cute?
Roar!
The King of New York City Alex the Lion!
I still think he's kind of a showoff.
The guy's an animal.
Maybe he should take a break.
You know, we could all use a vacation.
Come on, where would we go on vacation?
I don't know about you, but I want to go to Connecticut!
On the loose, several animals, including the world famous Alex the Lion, escaped from the Central Park Zoo tonight.
The escapees were cornered in Grand Central Station.
He was a very bad kitty.
Animal rights activists, who convinced zoo officials to have the animals sent to Africa, were stunned to learn that the freighter carrying the animals was reported missing today.
Tonight, hundreds of New Yorkers have gathered at the zoo to mourn the loss of their beloved zoo animals.
The question on everyone's mind, where are they now?
I like to move it, move it
He likes to move it, move it
She likes to move it, move it
- We like to
- Move it!
Come on!
Y'all know this one!
It never gets stale!
- We like to
- Move it!
We'll miss you little fuzz buckets!
You've been a great crowd!
Glad we could introduce you to the toilet.
If you ever come look us up in Manhattan, feel free to call first.
Seriously though, call.
OK?
Settle down, everybody.
Be quiet!
You can't leave without this!
Surprise, freaks!
Shake it!
Shake it.
Look, I'm a lady!
I'm a lady, everyone!
I'm a lady!
Not really!
It's me, King Julien!
Which of you is attracted to me?
Hands up!
Hey, freaks!
You will be very glad to hear that I am coming with you.
Oh, no, thank you.
Yes, thank you.
It's my plane!
Until I return with the spoils from the new country Stevie will be in charge!
I don't think they like that idea.
What are you saying, Stevie?
No.
Could we...?
No, you didn't say that!
How is that even possible?
Naughty little thing!
Stevie says...
Let them eat cake!
King Julien, wait for me!
I'm all packed!
I have a whole itinerary planned!
Oh, no!
It's Mort!
He's so annoying!
Don't let him on.
Stop that thing!
He's carrying scissors and hand cream!
Everybody in!
Quickly, get in, get in!
Get in quick!
- Struts.
- Check.
- Flaps.
- Check.
- Engine.
Coffee maker.
- Check.
You guys!
Oopsie-daisy!
That has to be the second biggest slingshot I've ever seen.
But it'll have to do.
Attention.
This is your captain speaking.
In the event of an emergency, place the vest over your head then kiss your... good-bye.
New York City, here we come!
Pray to your personal God this hunk ofjunk flies.
Personal God, hunk...?
What?
We are go, sir.
Open the door!
I'm outside!
If cabin pressure is lost, place the mask over your face to hide your terrified expression.
Miss, aren't these supposed to be attached to my seat?
- No, sir.
- OK, boys, launch!
Launch!
- Launch!
- Launch!
Gremlin!
Hey, Mort.
Hi!
That was weird.
- Somebody's dreaming.
- I think I saw Mort on the plane wing.
You got Madagascar on the brain.
I know I'm gonna miss it.
It was incredible.
I think it'll seem more fun the further we are from it.
Like when you bit me on the butt?
I'm gonna take that thing you're holding onto and use it onstage.
It's all part of my little actor's salad bar of emotional tidbits.
Are the butts next to the croutons?
You don't need to be sarcastic.
When we get back, I might sign up for the breeding program.
Breeding program?
We reach a point when we want to meet somebody.
Settle down, have a relationship.
I can see that.
What?
Like dating?
Yeah, dating.
Other... other guys?
What do you mean, other guys?
Darn it!
What is holding up that beverage service?
!
I'm gonna go check.
You all keep talking.
I'm gonna catch a few winks.
It's so funny!
I like laughing!
It's such a nice experience!
To laugh!
Do you mind going back?
This is first class.
It's nothing personal.
We're just better than you.
Maurice, I'm open!
Hit me!
- He shoots, he scores!
- Is that Vivaldi?
- In-flight slave.
- Can I help you, Mr. Mankiewicz?
Bring my nuts on a silver platter.
We were checking on our drink order.
Sorry.
Been a little backed up.
- I guess I'll go back...
- Where's your body?
You're freaking me out!
Can you please go over there, please?
What happened to the separation of the classes?
I'm sure this democracy thing is just a fad.
We'll go out for pineapple, my bobbly-headed boobily-boo.
Skipper, look.
Analysis.
Looks like a small bulb used to indicate something unusual, like a malfunction.
I find it pretty and somewhat hypnotic.
That too, sir.
Right!
Rico?
Manual!
Problemo solved.
- We may be out of fuel.
- Why do you think so?
We've lost engine one and engine two is no longer on fire.
Buckle up, boys.
Don't look, doll.
This might get hairy.
Attention!
This is your captain.
I have good and bad news.
The good news is, we're landing immediately.
The bad news is, we're crash-landing.
When it comes to air travel, we know you have no choice.
But thanks for choosing Air Penguin.
Raise your arms, Maurice!
It's more fun when you raise your arms!
I can fly!
This could be it, Marty!
I want you to know you are a one-in-a-million friend!
Thanks, buddy!
You're the best ever!
- And you won't mind when I tell you...
- Tell me anything!
I broke your iPod!
The buttons were so small!
It made me mad!
- The horror!
- I'm sorry!
- I'll kill you, butt-biter!
- It was an accident!
- An accident!
- Butt-biter!
I love you, Gloria!
I always have!
Like you love the beach.
Or a good book.
Or the beach.
Goodness, doll, you're shaking like a leaf.
Rico, you've had your fun.
Pull up.
Gear down.
Gently.
You just want to kiss the ground.
Just a peck, a smooch, like you'd kiss your sister.
I said, kiss it!
Now just a little brake.
Just a touch.
I believe that's checkmate.
Commence emergency landing procedure.
Flaps up!
Deploy!
Oh, we're here.
What in the world?
What happened to the plane?
What did y'all do to the plane?
I'm OK.
I'm alive.
I can't even sleep for a minute.
This is not JFK.
Kowalski, casualty report.
Two passengers unaccounted for.
That's a number I can live with.
Good landing, boys.
Who says a penguin can't fly?
Hey, happy slappers!
Is there some reason to celebrate?
Look at the plane!
- We'll fix it.
- How are you gonna fix this?
Grit, spit and a whole lot of duct tape.
We should be up and running in, say, six to nine months.
- Sixty-nine months?
!
- No, six to nine months.
Kowalski, I say we use this setback to our advantage.
- Where'd you get that number?
- I want you to reconfigure the design.
How do you estimate that?
Pretty boy!
Why don't you and your friends dig a latrine.
Hold on.
Who made you king of the plane wreck?
Excuse me?
Fine.
You can be in charge.
You fix the plane.
Who gives you the authority to put me in charge?
OK, then I'll remain in charge.
Yeah, you will remain in charge.
You and your hippie friends stay out of our hair.
Correcto-mundo.
Because I decided to.
- Good for you.
- Well, this discussion isn't over.
Higher mammals!
Stay with us.
We could use your front cortexes and opposable thumbs.
Phil!
I should wash your hands out with soap.
How in the hell-o will they fix this plane?
!
You know, grit and spit and spit.
A lot of spit and grit and stick-to-it-iveness.
That don't sound too promising.
You're right.
We're stuck here.
As long as we're together, we'll be OK.
Yeah, but love ain't gonna get us home.
Behold!
The lion!
- People!
- There is much to see.
Moving on.
Wait, wait, wait!
People!
- They'll help us!
- Wait up!
- People!
Stop!
- Help us!
If you stop, I'll autograph those!
I know you!
You.
It's the bad kitty.
How do you like some of that?
!
Come in, Tokyo!
Right in the batteries.
You think an old lady can't take care of herself?
Next time, I won't go so easy on you!
Thank you, dear.
Moving on!
Are you out of your mind?
We need help and you harass old ladies?
!
Out of my mind?
Who's out of my mind now?
- See if you can get an operator.
- No problem.
Out of my mind.
We're going home.
Message E-4.
The service user has roamed outside the coverage area.
Please try again later.
Am I trippin'?
All those zebras...
like me.
- Where are we?
- San Diego.
This time I'm 40 percent sure.
- I know this place.
- I think it's Africa.
Africa?
It's got to be.
Our ancestral crib.
It's in our blood.
I can feel it!
No, it's more than that.
It's like déjà vu, like I've been here before.
It's like Roots!
No, it's like déjà vu, like I've been here before.
How!
How!
Me Alex!
Me and me friends fly, fly in great metal bird.
Then plummet!
Smash ground!
Go boom!
Then here we emerge.
We offer only happiness and good greetings.
Is he dancing about a plane crash?
Yeah.
We just... yeah.
I thought...
Sorry.
You came from off the reserve?
Way off.
From the Central Park Zoo, actually.
Don't strain yourself.
What's going on here?
They say they're from off the reserve.
That's impossible.
Only people come from off the reserve.
You look familiar.
Do I know you?
How could you survive the hunters?
We didn't see any hunters.
- What are you looking at?
- Me?
Nothing.
This watering hole doesn't need any more mouths to feed.
So skedaddle back to where you came from.
Is there a manager we could talk to?
I see.
You're here to challenge me!
What?
No!
No.
That's what it looks like to me!
Zuba!
Wait.
I'm trying to take care of business...
Yeah, yeah, Zuba.
Hold on.
Alakay?
Is that you?
No, it's Alex.
Lx.
Like New York Knicks.
Zuba, look!
I've always had that.
The vet checked it out.
It's kind of a beauty spot, really.
A mark.
All right, this is a little weird.
Honey, he's come home.
What?
You've come home.
Son.
Dad.
Mom and Dad?
Mom and Dad!
Mom and Dad!
It's my mom and dad!
I got a mom and dad!
My baby's alive!
Dad!
My son!
My son is home!
Alakay!
Alakay has come home!
Alakay!
Yeah!
The prodigal son returns.
This is perfect!
I thought you hated Zuba.
No, I do.
I do.
I do.
I hate him.
Oh, I do.
And I'm going to use Alakay, yes.
I'm going to use him to get rid of Zuba once and for all!
Giddy-up, feathered horse!
Make way!
Move out of the way!
Stand aside!
New York!
It's a bit of a dump.
Are you sure we're not in New Jersey?
Hello, New Yorkers!
Your new king is here!
This calls for a celebration!
Maurice, I think they like me.
You've got to love a non-hostile takeover!
Chukka-chukka what?
Excuse me.
I'm Marty.
I'm kind of new around here.
Hey, Marty!
You're a good-looking group!
You like to run?
Yeah.
Running is crack-a-lackin'.
That's right!
Crack-a-lackin'.
You guys speak my crack-a-lackin' language.
What?
You don't have doctors here?
Not anymore.
Well, what if you catch a cold?
We go over to the dying holes and we die.
You guys really need a doctor.
- We have an opening.
- Would you be interested?
Me?
A doctor?
It's raining men.
Hallelujah!
You all got it going on.
Why don't you have a man?
You got worms?
Oh, I got rid of those.
Listen, girls.
Manhattan is short on two things, parking and hippos.
Hey, everybody!
I just found out that my son is a doggone king!
The King of New York!
Show me some of your moves, son.
Don't be bashful.
All right.
This one always knocks 'em dead.
Roar!
Look out.
The King is mad.
The King is mad!
Let's welcome him back into the pride with open arms!
Welcome to the herd, Marty!
Me?
I've always wanted to be part of a herd!
- It's one for all...
- And all for all, y'all!
How do I look?
Technically, a traditional witch doctor has a bone through his nose.
Don't worry... it's just a clip-on.
Voilà!
He's a witch doctor!
My mother will be so happy.
Look out!
I think Moto Moto likes you.
Here he comes.
I like 'em big
I like 'em chunky
I like 'em big I like 'em plumpy
I like 'em round With something' somethin'
They like my sound They think I'm funky
Goodness, girl... you huge.
Who's your friend?
Or is that your butt?
You as quick as you are hefty.
So you're Moto Moto?
The name's so nice, you say it twice.
I kind of like it, fatso.
I'll see you around, girl.
It won't be hard, because you so... plumpy.
Oops!
I hate to be a party pooper, Zuba, but some of the lions were wondering when you plan to banish your son.
- What are you talking about?
- It's nothing, really.
They're griping that Alakay never went through the rite of passage, blah, blah, blah, so technically speaking, he can't be a member of the pride.
It's nonsense.
I forgot about the rite of passage.
What is it?
What's this rite of passage?
A traditional coming-of-age ceremony.
Young lions earn their manes by demonstrating their skills.
- A show-of-skill talent show deal?
- Yeah.
Strutting their stuff.
A performance!
I think that's up my alley.
If it's tradition, I want to do it.
Strut my stuff.
Earn my mane.
I want to be Alaki.
- Alakay.
- Alakay!
Even better.
We will hold the rite of passage in the morning!
That's wonderful!
Good luck, Alakay.
Where I'm from, we say, "Break a leg."
That's my boy!
I'm a private dancer
A dancer for money
Any old music will do
Beautiful, isn't it?
It's amazing.
Guys this is where we belong.
Operation Tourist Trap is a go.
Oh, I like that one.
It works on many levels.
You guys are a bunch of suck-ups.
- That, too.
- Absolutely.
Stations.
Stage one.
Go!
Oh, no!
What have I done?
Come on, take the bait.
- What happened?
- Oh, look at the poor little guy.
Is it dead?
Stage two!
Go, go, go!
I will give him the kiss of life.
Rico!
Rico!
Reverse!
Gas!
Music!
No!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Come back!
What is all this rock'n'roll racket?
!
Is she dead?
No!
You hoodlums!
Good heavens!
Are you OK?
Lady, I found your pocketbook.
My handbag.
Such a good boy.
Nana can't survive without it.
You are one tough cookie.
Brownies Troop 416, Yonkers.
OK, nobody panic!
The best thing we can do is stay together.
We'll wait for another tour jeep.
It may take hours, but...
Where are you going?
I'm not staying here to be attacked by more animals!
I'm too old to die.
I'm going with her.
Old lady, wait up!
Please!
We need to stay together.
Fine!
We'll go that way!
Does anyone want a hard candy?
- Easy now.
- Watch your step.
And right here...
OK, are you ready?
This is where you always slept.
Oh, man!
- Was this mine?
- Look at you.
Look at him.
Oh, this thing.
Look, look!
- I remember this!
- He remembers.
A little harder than...
You never slept on the right end.
You always slept on the bottom end.
Is that...?
Is that my...?
Is that me?
You had the cutest little paws.
Little, little bitty ol' paws.
You did that the day we lost you.
Wow.
I was so young.
What happened to me?
It was all my fault.
I turned my back and...
It was not your fault.
Your father did everything he could.
He tracked those hunters for weeks.
Far off the reserve.
Finally, I had to assume the hunters well...
We thought they'd killed you.
But my son fought them off!
Don't mess with the King of New York!
- That's right!
- Keep your chin in.
You boys be careful!
Watch out before you break something.
You used to call this "foofie."
"Foofie"?
Foofie.
He doesn't want that.
This is my foofie!
Zuba, you better give him his foofie.
I mean, no, thank you, thank you.
It's perfect.
Son, you get your rest.
You have a big day tomorrow.
You'll need all your strength.
I will bring the house down for you.
I hope so.
Otherwise, your father will have to banish you.
Jeez, Mom, really?
I know you'll do us proud.
You know why?
You were born with it.
Good night, Alakay.
My boy.
My own boy.
My son's a king.
My son's a king.
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Alakay.
Foofie.
Look at foofie!
My foofie!
Foofie, foofie, foofie.
My foofie!
No sign of civilization.
Everybody appears very tired.
I think we're lost.
Nana, do you know where you're going?
No, but I'm going with a skip in my step and a smile on my face.
Sure, right, OK.
Yeah, all right.
- It's people.
- How did you get here?
- Can you help us?
We're lost.
- We're lost too.
It was awful.
A flash of black and white and they were gone.
They took the jeep!
- That happened to our jeep too!
- What do we do?
How will we all survive?
No food, no water, no shelter.
What are we gonna do?
!
You can let nature get the best of you, or you can get the best of nature.
Gather 'round, children.
We're New Yorkers, right?
Yeah.
We survive the concrete jungle!
When we need food, we hunt for a decent hot dog stand.
- Am I right?
- She's right.
When we need shelter, we build skyscrapers.
- Exactly!
- When we need water, we build a dam.
We're New Yorkers, for crying out loud!
If we can make it there, we can make it anywhere!
I'm coming, King Julien!
Bad fishy!
Bad fishy!
No, shark, no!
Sit!
Why am I laughing?
We have all the parts we need, but we're slightly behind schedule.
- How slightly?
- Six to nine years.
- Sixty-nine years?
- No, six to nine years.
Private!
What happened to our thumbs?
Haven't seen them since yesterday.
Darn you, Darwin!
Nobody goes AWOL on my watch.
Private!
You're coming with me.
Rico!
You're coming with me!
- We'll bring them in for court martial.
- That won't be necessary!
We've recruited a few extra thumbs for you, Skipper.
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.
Oh, I doubt that.
Enough lollygagging.
Let's get to work.
There'll be three groups.
Group Alpha will do sheet metal fabrication.
Group Bronson handles assembly.
Group George Peppard, craft services.
Any questions?
Good!
Let's get to work.
I'd like to kiss you, monkey man.
All right, but you're so darn ugly.
Remember, little cub scouts, a great dance performance comes from the heart.
Straight from the heart, you'll never go wrong.
Sure, mister.
Hey, Alakay, I just happened to walk by, I thought I'd wish you luck.
- You're not nervous, are you?
- Nah, it's my thing.
In my opinion, the key to this is choosing the right competitor.
You mean, this is like a dance battle sort of thing?
- Like a dance-off?
- Sure.
Great.
I love that.
Freestyle.
Who'd be a good match for me?
Just to keep things interesting.
Well, I wish I could help, but that's strictly against our ancient tradition and all we hold sacred.
But if it was me out there...
I'd choose Teetsi.
Teetsi.
OK.
Sounds interesting.
Makunga, right?
Thank you.
Anything for Zuba's boy.
Go get 'em, tiger.
Shake it out.
A five, six, seven, eight.
Let's go, let's do this.
Let us begin the rite of passage ceremony.
- Come on, baby!
Make Mama proud!
- Woman, I'm trying to take...
On it, Mom!
Who will be the first participant?
Me!
Oh!
Me, me, me!
Me!
Me!
Me!
Me, me!
Please, me?
How about you?
The tall, handsome one.
Yeah.
Choose your opponent.
Let me see.
I guess I'll pick Teetsi?
Teetsi?
Why did he pick Teetsi?
That's my boy!
He's got some gumption there!
Somebody, wake him up!
All right, so, Teetsi, come on.
Let's do this, huh?
Come on, little tsetse fly.
Let's see your stuff.
Bring it.
- Let's dance!
- OK.
But let me warn you that I am a protégé of Fosse and Robbins!
Not "dance" dance!
Fight!
Dance fight!
You got it.
- Is he dancing?
- What's he doing?
I know that boy is not dancing.
This is even better than I thought.
Alakay, turn around!
No, Pop, it's hop, shuffle, ball change, hip swish, turn around.
Oh, no.
Alakay!
Are you hurt?
Yeah, I am.
Did I... did I win?
No, son.
How could this happen?
You told us you were a king.
A king does not get beat.
I am a king.
I'm the King of New York.
It's my stage name.
Like for when I perform.
Perform?
Oh, no, this is horrible!
Alakay has failed the test!
Who would have ever imagined that today Zuba would have to banish his own son?
Zuba, no.
Zuba, yes.
Sadly, the alpha lion must cast out all failures.
Then I'm no longer the alpha lion.
Dad, what are you doing?
Dad, no!
You can't do this.
Who could possibly take Zuba's place?
Anyone?
Someone?
No one?
You, sir!
I guess not.
Well, I... this is all very awkward, but I suppose I could carry this tremendous burden.
Teetsi!
Get the hat.
As your new leader, I hereby banish Alakay!
He shall wear this Hat of Shame and leave the watering hole for a thousand years, or life!
Whichever comes last.
Shoo, shoo!
Get out of here!
You should have told us you weren't a real king, son!
You never told me I'd have to fight anybody!
What did you expect?
!
I don't know!
Maybe a little fatherly advice like, "Hey, son, it's a fight!"
- You're a lion!
- But I never fought another lion!
No, I guess not.
You dance!
And other stuff!
Your pal, Makunga, set me up back there!
- None of this would have happened...
- If you were a real lion.
- Zuba!
- Yeah, I said it!
A real lion.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Saw.
Suture.
Swab.
You're in my light, Stephen.
You have a brown spot on your shoulder.
That's very observant, Stephen.
As you can see, I'm covered in brown spots.
OK!
That bone will be good as new in a few weeks.
So I don't have to pick out a dying hole?
No, you got your whole life ahead of you.
- Really?
- Go out and grab it by the horns.
- Thank you, Dr. Mankiewicz!
- Break a leg!
Sweet kid.
This spot looks like Witch Doctor's Disease.
Witch Doctor's Disease?
That's the most ridiculous disease I've ever heard of.
- Don't ask.
- Someone's been knotty.
This won't hurt a bit.
Joe, our last witch doctor, had a spot just like that.
- And?
- Monday, Joe.
Wednesday, no Joe.
Wednesday, no Joe?
I can breathe!
Thanks, doc!
So this Witch Doctor's Disease is a real thing?
You'll find a cure.
You've got at least 48 hours!
But I've never heard of it.
I mean...
I don't have any penicillin.
I'll need a CAT scan just to get started!
Have a lion look you over.
They'd be happy to.
Ta-da!
- He has talent.
- Stupendous and tremendous.
Hollah!
Bet you've never seen that one!
Knocked 'em dead in New York!
- Let's all give it a try!
- Let's do it!
Well, you can try all you want to, but it takes years of practice.
You'll never get a tight stream until you build up your lip muscles to the point where you can purse your lips like this.
You got it?
Ta-da!
How did you...?
You guys got it right out of the box!
- If you can do it...
...we can do it.
It's in our blood!
I always thought I was a bit unique.
We are unique!
We are like a force of nature!
- A million points of light!
- And dark stripes!
Exactly the same!
Exactly the same.
Looks impressive, Kowalski, but will it fly?
Yes.
If we fold it here, here and here.
Nice.
Oh, man.
My dad thinks I'm a total loser.
I've ruined my parents' lives.
That is definitely not crack-a-lackin'.
It is lacking' in the cracking', my friend.
I've gotta fix this.
So there's...
There's something I gotta tell you.
Hey, guys.
Is this place great or what?
!
I'd go with "or what."
Well, I'll tell you what.
You're not gonna believe it, but I got a date with Moto Moto.
Who's Moto Moto?
Oh, he's so big and handsome and big!
- Know what "Moto Moto" means?
- Twins?
It means, "Hot Hot."
"Hot Hot"?
When did you start parlez-ing African?
It's in my blood.
Don't worry, you can flirt around with Mr. Hot Pants after I'm gone.
Melman, why am I the parade and you're the rain?
Why are you driving your parade under my rain?
Maybe I'll parade in another part of town!
Whoa, guys.
Main Street's mine!
Well, you can have it!
And you can take your hotee-tot float and Mr. Hotee Moto Moto...
- What are you talking about?
- What are we talking about?
Melman, just tell her.
What?
What are you...
I don't know what you're talking about.
I guess I'll go, then.
Don't bother.
- Don't get up on my account.
- Melman!
Gloria!
- I thought you guys were friends!
- Marty's absolutely right.
- Marty?
- Marty?
Marty?
What the heck is going on?
You're not...?
Oh!
He was...
I thought he...
You're not him.
He's...
Oh.
You thought that guy was me?
No.
I mean, yes, you...
Guys, come on.
You thought I was him?
You guys kind of do look a little...
You look a lot alike.
Marty, you look a lot alike.
You laugh alike.
Talk alike.
He has the same speech pattern.
It's a little weird, really.
I mean, come on.
Marty.
So you're saying there's nothing unique about me.
I'm just like any other zebra.
No.
Of course you're different!
How?
OK, I can't tell you apart.
Maybe you could wear a bell or something.
- A bell?
!
- OK, not a bell.
Bell's a bad idea.
How about a T-shirt that says, "I'm with stupid"?
- I'm not stupid!
- Not you, stupid!
Him, stupid!
You know, while you've been doing the prancing pony with your new posse,
I've been having the worst day of my life.
It's always about you, isn't it?
My problems are just a little bit bigger than yours.
I couldn't tell you apart.
So what?
!
Yeah, fine.
Run away, Marty!
Run away!
That's what you do best!
Just like back in New York!
I'm right here.
But you can't tell that, right?
Your one-of-a-million friend hopes you enjoy your bigger-than-anyone-else's problems alone!
Good, leave!
I don't need you to help me solve my problems!
You're a dime a dozen!
I can't tell which one's Marty!
Which one's Marty?
Wait a minute.
Oh, yeah, I don't care!
Nice hat, you showoff!
Marty don't go.
Giddy-up, giddy-up!
Look, Maurice!
The perfect spot for my summer palace!
Please fill in all these holes and relocate the riff-raff.
- Who'd leave a perfectly good head?
- What a waste.
Tell me about it.
I'm in my prime here.
I'm terminal, you know?
I probably only have another two days left to live.
That's a bummer, man.
If I, King Julien... that's my name only had two days left to live,
I would do all the things
- I've ever dreamed of doing.
- Like what?
I'd love to become a professional whistler.
I'm pretty amazing at it now, but I want to get even better, make my living out of it.
You know what else I would do?
I would invade a neighboring country and impose my own ideology, even if they didn't want it!
Easy for you to say.
You're a king.
Yes.
And you are only just a sad little head.
There must be something you want to do before you die!
- There is this one thing.
- What?
Tell me.
- No, I couldn't.
- What is it?
I never told Gloria how I feel about her.
What is it?
Please tell me!
I never had the guts to tell Gloria how I feel about her.
How I've always felt about her.
Fine.
Don't tell me!
Is it a woman?
You didn't tell me it's a woman.
What are you afraid of?
You're a dead man anyway.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're right.
You've got to march right up to this woman.
Look her right in the eye.
Lean forward.
Just a little, or almost all the way.
Then you let her lean forward a little until you're just lips' distance away from each other.
Then you tell her how much you hate her.
Actually, it's more like love her.
Oh, you sly dog!
Woof, woof!
You're a real player.
Now listen to me.
You got to rise up.
You hearing me?
- He didn't hear you.
- I can't hear you!
- You got to rise up!
- Rising up!
- Get out of the hole!
- I'm rising out of the ground!
- He's rising, Maurice.
- I'm rising, Maurice!
- Rising!
- You go right up to this woman!
Do you feel it?
- Go up to her face!
- Tell the truth!
- I'm going to tell her!
- Then you say, "Baby, I dig you!"
Yeah!
I'm going to do it!
I'm going to do it!
I love that happy little head.
She love
Moto Moto
She love
Moto Moto
She loves me She loves my eyes
She loves me She loves my thighs
She loves my roundness
She love that I'm chunky She love that I'm plumpy
She love my heftiness She love my zestiness
She love me restlessly She love me forever
She love me 'cause she love me
Moto Moto before things get too serious, well,
I was wondering, if I were to, for example, stay here I'd like to ask you...
Let your candied lips be the messengers to my... ear canal.
I have so many questions.
I promise the answer will always be yes.
Unless no is required.
So what is it about me that you find so interesting?
You're the most plumpenest girl I've ever met.
OK.
Other than that.
Let's see.
Yeah, well, you know... you chunky.
Right.
My gosh, girl, you huge.
You said that.
Yeah, that's right.
We don't have to talk no more.
Gloria!
Gloria.
Melman.
Melman, I want you to meet Moto Moto.
Moto Moto.
Yeah, nice to meet you.
- I guess I...
- It's OK, Melman.
Apology accepted.
Oh.
Yeah, right, that.
That's why I...
Good.
OK.
Well, that's it, then.
Good.
We're kind of busy here, man.
No.
No, that's not it.
Listen, Mototo, you better treat this lady like a queen.
Because you, my friend, you found yourself the perfect woman.
If I was ever so lucky to find the perfect woman,
I'd give her flowers every day.
And not just any flowers.
OK?
Her favorites are orchids.
White.
And breakfast in bed.
Six loaves of wheat toast, butter on both sides.
No crust, the way she likes it.
I'd be her shoulder to cry on and her best friend.
I'd spend every day thinking of how to make her laugh.
She has the most amazing laugh.
That's what I would do if I were you.
But I'm not, so you do it.
OK.
What?
That was beautiful.
Anyways, where were we?
I'm "huge"?
Surprised to see me, Makunga?
Well, I'm here to set things straight, like a real lion!
Is this real enough for you?
How about this?
This is for setting me up!
This is for stealing my dad's job!
This is for humiliating my family!
And making me look like a fool!
Had enough?
Sure, fly away!
Coward.
The water.
It's gone.
It's never gone dry before.
- We'll need a lot more dying holes.
- How could this happen?
Out of my way!
What is going on here?
!
The watering hole is dry!
There's barely water for one of us!
- Good observation, Shirley.
- I'm Bobby.
Makunga, what do we do?
Quiet!
Listen up!
I'm afraid there is only one solution to this horrible crisis:
We'll all have to fight for it.
- We can't fight for it.
- That's crazy.
That's not fair.
You'd win!
Exactly, Shirley.
I'm Bob...
Sorry, folks, but life isn't fair.
I'm in charge now, thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion.
Please, Makunga, this is the only water on the reserve.
If you're thirsty, you'll have to look for water off the reserve.
- Off the reserve?
- It's too dangerous!
Hunters would shoot us!
No one leaves the reserve and survives!
I left the reserve!
And survived.
I can do something about this.
Looks like a clogged pipe, like we get in New York.
I'll travel upriver...
- Upriver?
- Off the reserve?
You?
Yeah.
I'll unclog the pipe and bring back your water.
Great!
I'd help you pack, but by the looks of that hat, I see you're all set!
Fine.
Go ahead, laugh.
Laugh your mane off.
I'll prove you wrong.
Maybe you should try a little rain dance.
Zuba would know what to do.
- Where's Zuba?
- You don't care about us.
Zuba should be in charge, not you.
All right, fine!
As an added measure, I will consult with Zuba!
Marty?
Hey!
Marty!
Marty?
Marty.
Where'd you get the fruity hat?
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
Hi.
Is Marty in there?
Anyone seen Marty?
Which one of us is Marty?
All right.
Well, if you see him, tell him his friend Alex came to say goodbye.
Goodbye?
Don't go.
Where are you going?
- Can we come?
- No.
I have to do this alone.
You can't leave the reserve!
What are you doing?
- They'll get your hat.
- Hunters are everywhere!
Could you leave the hat?
Marty!
I know you're in there.
Before I go, I got something I want to say.
You've been a great friend.
You've helped me so often to see the bright side of my problems that I never think of you having any.
I wasn't there for you when you needed me.
Just like back at the zoo.
What kind of friend does that make me?
A pretty lousy friend, I guess.
I just want you to know that I...
You're one in a million.
This is touching.
It is touching.
So could you turn around so I can tell you to your face?
That's right.
Gotcha!
I see you in there!
Yeah, you.
You, right there.
Twelfth row, two hundred and third from the left.
That's you, Marty.
I know it's you.
Know what makes you special?
These guys are white with black stripes.
You're black with white stripes.
You're a dreamer, Marty.
Always have been.
You have great taste in music and horrible taste in friends.
Well, not Melman and Gloria, but me.
OK, I'm in.
Marty, you can't come with me.
You don't have a choice.
- People are out there!
- You're crazy!
Come back!
The people will get you!
Don't lose the hat!
Bye, hat!
Any water?
No, just more diamonds and gold.
Don't give up hope.
Listen up!
I will help you!
There's only one way to get your precious water.
I, your beloved King Julien must simply make a small sacrifice to my good friends, the water gods, in the volcano!
What does that do?
What does that do?
Excellent question.
My sacrifice goes in the volcano.
The friendly gods eat up my sacrifice.
"Thank you for the sacrifice."
"Here, have another." "No, I've had enough."
"I'll be insulted unless you have another."
"I don't want another sacrifice!"
"Look at you!
You're skinny!" "No!
I've had enough!"
The gods eat the sacrifice.
They are grateful.
They give me some water, and then I give it to you.
What?
Does it work?
No!
I mean, yes.
Well, Maurice?
Ah, it's fifty-fifty.
We'll do it!
Excellent!
Now all I need is someone who would like to go into the volcano and get eaten by gods.
Any hands!
Hands, anybody!
I need someone, perhaps who has never found love, who could look death straight in the eyeball.
A real, genuine hero.
- I'll do it.
- Melman?
Hurry up!
Before we all come to our senses!
Melman, what is wrong with you?
I'm dying anyway.
If there's a chance it'll get you water, it's worth it.
Are you nuts?
I want you to know, back at the zoo, it was never the doctors or prescriptions that kept me going.
It was always you.
Seeing you every day.
That's what kept me going.
Melman!
Wait!
Melman!
Melman!
Melman!
You going to mope like this all day?
Don't "hmph" me.
Listen, Zuba.
A miracle happened.
Our son came back to us.
How come that is not good enough for you?
What are you saying, woman?
We lost him once, Zuba.
Let's not lose him again.
Zuba!
- Zuba!
- Get out of here!
What do you want?
It's awful.
The watering hole is dried up.
Dried up?
That's impossible!
There's nothing left!
You're alpha lion, Makunga.
What are you gonna do about it?
Your son, Alakay, he said he could fix it.
He's gone upriver.
- Off the reserve?
!
- No!
I tried to stop him.
I told him it was suicide.
He was determined to prove himself to you.
You stay here, in case he comes back!
Hurry, Zuba!
I'm so parched.
Is this place starting to freak you out?
We'll slip in, find the problem.
Hunters will never know we were here.
Why are we doing this?
Maybe my dad will think I'm...
I want to show him I'm a real lion.
As opposed to a chocolate lion.
I know this may sound hard to believe, but apparently, lions don't dance.
What?
!
As far as my dad is concerned.
As far as people are concerned, you're a hit.
In New York.
This is Africa...
much tougher crowd.
Marty, this is it!
This is the clog!
Come on.
Well, there's the water.
Stay down.
Look at that.
Knit one, purl two.
It's her.
- Is this right?
- Very good.
Nana, slow down.
You're a little tangled, aren't you?
No, don't pull.
I'll do it.
We need dynamite.
Got any?
Oh, snap!
I just used my last stick this morning!
- Savages!
- Evasive maneuvers!
- Serpentine, serpentine!
- Squiggly squid maneuver!
Zag, zig-zag, zig ziggy zag!
No, no!
Squiggly squid!
Etch A Sketch!
That's too complex!
Octopus, octopus!
- Run, Marty!
- I can't leave you here!
Go get help!
Squiggly squid maneuver!
Go!
Go!
Squiggly squid!
Etch A Sketch!
Etch A Sketch!
Save us We love you
OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- Save us
- Melman
- We love you
- Melman
Save us
OK, here we go.
OK, OK.
- Melman
- We love you
- Melman
- Save us
Here we go!
Here we go!
- What's all the hoopla about?
- Joe?
Joe the Witch Doctor?
We thought you were dead!
So did I. Then I realized I'm covered in brown spots.
So Melman's not dying!
- Melman's not dying!
- Oh, no!
Melman!
Move!
Don't do this!
Julien, stop this!
This is crazy!
Oh, suddenly throwing a giraffe into a volcano to make water is crazy!
Yes!
- Please, Melman!
Stop!
- Gloria?
- You can't do this!
- Why not?
Because...
You can't do this, Melman.
First, that hurts.
Second, I've only got 18 hours to live, anyway.
Melman, I gotta know did you mean those things you said about me?
Of course I did.
- That's crazy.
- It is?
It's crazy to think I had to go halfway around the world to find out the perfect guy for me lived right next door.
Then it's you and me, neighbor.
You and me for the next 18 hours.
I'll take whatever you got.
- Maurice, what happened?
- I believe the fat lady has sung.
- What's going on here?
- Marty!
Alex is in big trouble!
We got to get upriver fast!
- What about the plane?
- Perfect!
Come on!
The plane won't be fixed until the suits meet our demands.
Now, maternity leave.
Maternity leave?
You're all males.
We need that plane for a rescue mission.
There's nothing I can do until we bust up this union.
I'll bust up all of you if you don't get this plane going.
Can't you see these commies have my hands tied?
No maternity leave.
Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want these blowing around on the savanna.
All right.
You get your maternity leave.
Finally.
Where we headed?
What's going on?
Where are we going?
Oh, no!
Please!
Don't put me there!
No!
This is wrong.
You see?
You are survivors.
Now, how about a nice lion casserole?
You can't eat a lion.
Don't worry, it tastes like chicken.
No, no, no.
Don't listen to her.
She's out of her mind, people!
I'm from New York City!
It's me, Alex the lion!
From Central Park!
Dad!
What were you thinking, son?
You got no business being out here!
Stay behind me.
They're New Yorkers.
They're just rude and frightened people.
Stay back!
You'd let your dinner get away?
- What are you doing?
- The only thing I know how to do.
What the heck?
Hey, I know those moves.
Alex?
- It's Alex the lion!
- From Central Park!
It is Alex!
Only one lion can move like that!
He's beautiful.
I can't believe it.
How does he do that?
What are you doing?
I'm dancing with my son!
I think.
Don't think, Dad.
Feel!
Butterfly!
I'm feeling it!
I'm feeling it!
Roar!
That was beautiful.
Now let's eat!
Dad, look out!
What the...
Alex!
Get in!
She's got a gun!
Get out while we can!
- What?
- She's got a gun!
Get out while we can!
Pass it on!
He said let's have some fun and take out the dam.
Basset hound.
Skipper!
Alex wants to take out the dam.
All right!
But it's his funeral.
- Hard to port!
- Aye-aye, Skippy!
Bring it on!
Bring it on!
Come back!
That's my dinner!
Kowalski, full throttle.
Music!
- I like this song.
- It never gets old.
It does have a catchy hook.
Come about!
Bring her in low!
Hold onto your skirts!
It's dam-busting time!
Hold on tight, baby!
Here we go!
Tell them no!
Pull up!
They'll kill us!
There's got to be another way!
Pass it on!
They say no pull up.
Kill us.
There's no other way.
Basset hound.
Are you sure?
Men, there is no sacrifice greater than someone else's.
No!
Medic!
Ramming speed!
Bring it on!
Bad kitties.
I don't know why the sacrifice didn't work.
The science seemed so solid.
I'd jump right in that volcano if I wasn't so good at whistling.
It's you!
I found you!
Mort?
Bad fishy!
I wonder if the gods like seafood.
Let's find out.
Look, Maurice.
- That was quick.
- I did it!
I did it!
I did it!
OK, you did it!
Oh, yes!
Look!
- It's Alakay!
- It's Zuba!
You did it!
Alakay, Zuba, you did it!
Zuba!
Alakay!
You're back!
I'm so glad you're safe!
Out of my way.
Well, well, well.
You know, Zuba, if I remember correctly, you quit the pride.
And you were kicked out.
So don't think that this changes anything.
You're right.
In fact, we humbly present you with this token of appreciation.
A man bag.
Very popular where I'm from.
- Don't know what to say.
- Still be tough and carry your stuff.
Does the strap adjust?
This will go very nicely for me when I go out hiking.
But you're still banished.
We figured you'd say that.
My handbag!
You bad kitty!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
You deserve this, son.
Welcome to the pride.
Thanks, Dad.
But this belongs to you.
No, son.
To us!
My son!
The King of New York!
That's my baby!
Love transcends all differences.
We are gathered here today to celebrate such a love.
Do you take each other, for better or for worse?
For better, please.
What a beautiful, weird couple!
That's not going to last.
Can I kiss the bride?
No!
Music!
- Struts.
- Check.
- Flaps!
- Check.
- Diamonds and gold.
- Check.
- Bye-bye!
- We'll miss you!
See you later!
We'll be back after the honeymoon in Monte Carlo, or whenever the gold runs out.
Come back soon!
Mom, let them take their time.
New York isn't going anywhere, right, guys?
You're right about that!
As long as I'm with her and you two, I don't care where we are.
She has the most amazing laugh.
Love has no boundaries!
Looks like you're stuck with us for a while.
Dad?
What's wrong?
I just thought we could hang out a bit and...
- You got me!
- I got you, son!
You got me with my thing.
You brought it back around on me.
I got you, son!
The old man's not too bad, eh, Marty?
- Marty?
Who's Marty?
- Come on.
- I don't know no Marty.
- You can't fool me.
Ain't no Marty here.
Marty!
I can look into your eyes, and I know it's you.
See, I've been traveling Been traveling forever
But now that I found a home feels like I'm in heaven
See, I've been traveling Been traveling forever
But now that I'm home
Hey!
Shake the hot things!
Shake the hot things!
Shake 'em!
Shake 'em!
Shake 'em!
Well done, boys.
Looks like ice-cold sushi for breakfast.
No, no, son.
Over here.
See the lion?
Look at the lion and get the lion.
Now, son, if you're gonna grow up and be like your daddy someday, you gotta learn how to fight.
Da-da.
Now, Alakay, let me show you something, OK?
You see this mark?
You and me are the same.
When you're bigger, you'll be Alpha Lion, just like me.
Now let me see you fight.
Ready?
No, Alakay.
No dancing!
You just amuse yourself, don't you?
You're a strange kid.
You're a strange one.
I'm...
Now, come on, let's try it again.
No, Alakay.
Stop that right now.
Doggone it!
It's so disappointing when they don't grow up the way you want.
Makunga.
You're not challenging me again, are you?
Look on the bright side.
After I defeat you and become alpha lion, you'll have more time to spend with your pathetic son.
Before I kick your butt, let me ask you:
Why do you want to become the alpha lion?
I'm better looking, I have better hair, I'm deceivingly smart and I want everyone else to do what I say.
We fight on three.
One...
Pay attention, Alakay.
Daddy will show you how it's done.
Two, three!
- Who's the alpha lion?
- You are.
Don't you forget it.
And that, Alakay, is how you attack...
Alakay?
That's it.
Here, kitty, kitty.
This one's a beauty.
He'll be worth a few bucks.
Itjust gets easier and easier.
Daddy!
Alakay!
Alakay!
Alakay!
Da-da!
No!
No!
No!
Alakay!
- Daddy!
- Daddy's got you!
Hold on!
Da-da!
Alakay!
Daddy!
I've been around the world in the pouring rain
Feeling out of place and feeling strange
Take me to a place where they know my name
'Oause I ain't met nobody that looks the same
I'm a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle

To relate to, to relate to
I'm feeling right at home
Feeling right at home Feeling right at home
Feeling right at home I'm feeling right at home
See I been traveling Been traveling forever...
- I don't like the looks of this guy.
- He's kind of cute.
He's kind of a showoff.
You think he's cute?
Roar!
The King of New York Oity Alex the Lion!
I still think he's kind of a showoff.
The guy's an animal.
Maybe he should take a break.
You know, we could all use a vacation.
Oome on, where would we go on vacation?
I don't know about you, but I want to go to Oonnecticut!
On the loose, several animals, including the world famous Alex the Lion, escaped from the Oentral Park Zoo tonight.
The escapees were cornered in Grand Oentral Station.
He was a very bad kitty.
Animal rights activists, who convinced zoo officials to have the animals sent to Africa, were stunned to learn that the freighter carrying the animals was reported missing today.
Tonight, hundreds of New Yorkers have gathered at the zoo to mourn the loss of their beloved zoo animals.
The question on everyone's mind, where are they now?
I like to move it, move it
He likes to move it, move it
She likes to move it, move it
- We like to
- Move it!
Oome on!
Y'all know this one!
It never gets stale!
- We like to
- Move it!
We'll miss you little fuzz buckets!
You've been a great crowd!
Glad we could introduce you to the toilet.
If you ever come look us up in Manhattan, feel free to call first.
Seriously though, call.
OK?
Settle down, everybody.
Be quiet!
You can't leave without this!
Surprise, freaks!
Shake it!
Shake it.
Look, I'm a lady!
I'm a lady, everyone!
I'm a lady!
Not really!
It's me, King Julien!
Which of you is attracted to me?
Hands up!
Hey, freaks!
You will be very glad to hear that I am coming with you.
Oh, no, thank you.
Yes, thank you.
It's my plane!
Until I return with the spoils from the new country Stevie will be in charge!
I don't think they like that idea.
What are you saying, Stevie?
No.
Oould we...?
No, you didn't say that!
How is that even possible?
Naughty little thing!
Stevie says...
Let them eat cake!
King Julien, wait for me!
I'm all packed!
I have a whole itinerary planned!
Oh, no!
It's Mort!
He's so annoying!
Don't let him on.
Stop that thing!
He's carrying scissors and hand cream!
Everybody in!
Quickly, get in, get in!
Get in quick!
- Struts.
- Oheck.
- Flaps.
- Oheck.
- Engine.
Ooffee maker.
- Oheck.
You guys!
Oopsie-daisy!
That has to be the second biggest slingshot I've ever seen.
But it'll have to do.
Attention.
This is your captain speaking.
In the event of an emergency, place the vest over your head then kiss your... good-bye.
New York Oity, here we come!
Pray to your personal God this hunk ofjunk flies.
Personal God, hunk...?
What?
We are go, sir.
Open the door!
I'm outside!
If cabin pressure is lost, place the mask over your face to hide your terrified expression.
Miss, aren't these supposed to be attached to my seat?
- No, sir.
- OK, boys, launch!
Launch!
- Launch!
- Launch!
Gremlin!
Hey, Mort.
Hi!
That was weird.
- Somebody's dreaming.
- I think I saw Mort on the plane wing.
You got Madagascar on the brain.
I know I'm gonna miss it.
It was incredible.
I think it'll seem more fun the further we are from it.
Like when you bit me on the butt?
I'm gonna take that thing you're holding onto and use it onstage.
It's all part of my little actor's salad bar of emotional tidbits.
Are the butts next to the croutons?
You don't need to be sarcastic.
When we get back, I might sign up for the breeding program.
Breeding program?
We reach a point when we want to meet somebody.
Settle down, have a relationship.
I can see that.
What?
Like dating?
Yeah, dating.
Other... other guys?
What do you mean, other guys?
Darn it!
What is holding up that beverage service?
!
I'm gonna go check.
You all keep talking.
I'm gonna catch a few winks.
It's so funny!
I like laughing!
It's such a nice experience!
To laugh!
Do you mind going back?
This is first class.
It's nothing personal.
We're just better than you.
Maurice, I'm open!
Hit me!
- He shoots, he scores!
- Is that Vivaldi?
- In-flight slave.
- Oan I help you, Mr. Mankiewicz?
Bring my nuts on a silver platter.
We were checking on our drink order.
Sorry.
Been a little backed up.
- I guess I'll go back...
- Where's your body?
You're freaking me out!
Oan you please go over there, please?
What happened to the separation of the classes?
I'm sure this democracy thing is just a fad.
We'll go out for pineapple, my bobbly-headed boobily-boo.
Skipper, look.
Analysis.
Looks like a small bulb used to indicate something unusual, like a malfunction.
I find it pretty and somewhat hypnotic.
That too, sir.
Right!
Rico?
Manual!
Problemo solved.
- We may be out of fuel.
- Why do you think so?
We've lost engine one and engine two is no longer on fire.
Buckle up, boys.
Don't look, doll.
This might get hairy.
Attention!
This is your captain.
I have good and bad news.
The good news is, we're landing immediately.
The bad news is, we're crash-landing.
When it comes to air travel, we know you have no choice.
But thanks for choosing Air Penguin.
Raise your arms, Maurice!
It's more fun when you raise your arms!
I can fly!
This could be it, Marty!
I want you to know you are a one-in-a-million friend!
Thanks, buddy!
You're the best ever!
- And you won't mind when I tell you...
- Tell me anything!
I broke your iPod!
The buttons were so small!
It made me mad!
- The horror!
- I'm sorry!
- I'll kill you, butt-biter!
- It was an accident!
- An accident!
- Butt-biter!
I love you, Gloria!
I always have!
Like you love the beach.
Or a good book.
Or the beach.
Goodness, doll, you're shaking like a leaf.
Rico, you've had your fun.
Pull up.
Gear down.
Gently.
You just want to kiss the ground.
Just a peck, a smooch, like you'd kiss your sister.
I said, kiss it!
Now just a little brake.
Just a touch.
I believe that's checkmate.
Oommence emergency landing procedure.
Flaps up!
Deploy!
Oh, we're here.
What in the world?
What happened to the plane?
What did y'all do to the plane?
I'm OK.
I'm alive.
I can't even sleep for a minute.
This is not JFK.
Kowalski, casualty report.
Two passengers unaccounted for.
That's a number I can live with.
Good landing, boys.
Who says a penguin can't fly?
Hey, happy slappers!
Is there some reason to celebrate?
Look at the plane!
- We'll fix it.
- How are you gonna fix this?
Grit, spit and a whole lot of duct tape.
We should be up and running in, say, six to nine months.
- Sixty-nine months?
!
- No, six to nine months.
Kowalski, I say we use this setback to our advantage.
- Where'd you get that number?
- I want you to reconfigure the design.
How do you estimate that?
Pretty boy!
Why don't you and your friends dig a latrine.
Hold on.
Who made you king of the plane wreck?
Excuse me?
Fine.
You can be in charge.
You fix the plane.
Who gives you the authority to put me in charge?
OK, then I'll remain in charge.
Yeah, you will remain in charge.
You and your hippie friends stay out of our hair.
Oorrecto-mundo.
Because I decided to.
- Good for you.
- Well, this discussion isn't over.
Higher mammals!
Stay with us.
We could use your front cortexes and opposable thumbs.
Phil!
I should wash your hands out with soap.
How in the hell-o will they fix this plane?
!
You know, grit and spit and spit.
A lot of spit and grit and stick-to-it-iveness.
That don't sound too promising.
You're right.
We're stuck here.
As long as we're together, we'll be OK.
Yeah, but love ain't gonna get us home.
Behold!
The lion!
- People!
- There is much to see.
Moving on.
Wait, wait, wait!
People!
- They'll help us!
- Wait up!
- People!
Stop!
- Help us!
If you stop, I'll autograph those!
I know you!
You.
It's the bad kitty.
How do you like some of that?
!
Oome in, Tokyo!
Right in the batteries.
You think an old lady can't take care of herself?
Next time, I won't go so easy on you!
Thank you, dear.
Moving on!
Are you out of your mind?
We need help and you harass old ladies?
!
Out of my mind?
Who's out of my mind now?
- See if you can get an operator.
- No problem.
Out of my mind.
We're going home.
Message E-4.
The service user has roamed outside the coverage area.
Please try again later.
Am I trippin'?
All those zebras...
like me.
- Where are we?
- San Diego.
This time I'm 40 percent sure.
- I know this place.
- I think it's Africa.
Africa?
It's got to be.
Our ancestral crib.
It's in our blood.
I can feel it!
No, it's more than that.
It's like déjà vu, like I've been here before.
It's like Roots!
No, it's like déjà vu, like I've been here before.
How!
How!
Me Alex!
Me and me friends fly, fly in great metal bird.
Then plummet!
Smash ground!
Go boom!
Then here we emerge.
We offer only happiness and good greetings.
Is he dancing about a plane crash?
Yeah.
We just... yeah.
I thought...
Sorry.
You came from off the reserve?
Way off.
From the Oentral Park Zoo, actually.
Don't strain yourself.
What's going on here?
They say they're from off the reserve.
That's impossible.
Only people come from off the reserve.
You look familiar.
Do I know you?
How could you survive the hunters?
We didn't see any hunters.
- What are you looking at?
- Me?
Nothing.
This watering hole doesn't need any more mouths to feed.
So skedaddle back to where you came from.
Is there a manager we could talk to?
I see.
You're here to challenge me!
What?
No!
No.
That's what it looks like to me!
Zuba!
Wait.
I'm trying to take care of business...
Yeah, yeah, Zuba.
Hold on.
Alakay?
Is that you?
No, it's Alex.
Ix.
Like New York Knicks.
Zuba, look!
I've always had that.
The vet checked it out.
It's kind of a beauty spot, really.
A mark.
All right, this is a little weird.
Honey, he's come home.
What?
You've come home.
Son.
Dad.
Mom and Dad?
Mom and Dad!
Mom and Dad!
It's my mom and dad!
I got a mom and dad!
My baby's alive!
Dad!
My son!
My son is home!
Alakay!
Alakay has come home!
Alakay!
Yeah!
The prodigal son returns.
This is perfect!
I thought you hated Zuba.
No, I do.
I do.
I do.
I hate him.
Oh, I do.
And I'm going to use Alakay, yes.
I'm going to use him to get rid of Zuba once and for all!
Giddy-up, feathered horse!
Make way!
Move out of the way!
Stand aside!
New York!
It's a bit of a dump.
Are you sure we're not in New Jersey?
Hello, New Yorkers!
Your new king is here!
This calls for a celebration!
Maurice, I think they like me.
You've got to love a non-hostile takeover!
Ohukka-chukka what?
Excuse me.
I'm Marty.
I'm kind of new around here.
Hey, Marty!
You're a good-looking group!
You like to run?
Yeah.
Running is crack-a-lackin'.
That's right!
Orack-a-lackin'.
You guys speak my crack-a-lackin' language.
What?
You don't have doctors here?
Not anymore.
Well, what if you catch a cold?
We go over to the dying holes and we die.
You guys really need a doctor.
- We have an opening.
- Would you be interested?
Me?
A doctor?
It's raining men.
Hallelujah!
You all got it going on.
Why don't you have a man?
You got worms?
Oh, I got rid of those.
Listen, girls.
Manhattan is short on two things, parking and hippos.
Hey, everybody!
I just found out that my son is a doggone king!
The King of New York!
Show me some of your moves, son.
Don't be bashful.
All right.
This one always knocks 'em dead.
Roar!
Look out.
The King is mad.
The King is mad!
Let's welcome him back into the pride with open arms!
Welcome to the herd, Marty!
Me?
I've always wanted to be part of a herd!
- It's one for all...
- And all for all, y'all!
How do I look?
Technically, a traditional witch doctor has a bone through his nose.
Don't worry... it's just a clip-on.
Voilà!
He's a witch doctor!
My mother will be so happy.
Look out!
I think Moto Moto likes you.
Here he comes.
I like 'em big
I like 'em chunky
I like 'em big I like 'em plumpy
I like 'em round With something' somethin'
They like my sound They think I'm funky
Goodness, girl... you huge.
Who's your friend?
Or is that your butt?
You as quick as you are hefty.
So you're Moto Moto?
The name's so nice, you say it twice.
I kind of like it, fatso.
I'll see you around, girl.
It won't be hard, because you so... plumpy.
Oops!
I hate to be a party pooper, Zuba, but some of the lions were wondering when you plan to banish your son.
- What are you talking about?
- It's nothing, really.
They're griping that Alakay never went through the rite of passage, blah, blah, blah, so technically speaking, he can't be a member of the pride.
It's nonsense.
I forgot about the rite of passage.
What is it?
What's this rite of passage?
A traditional coming-of-age ceremony.
Young lions earn their manes by demonstrating their skills.
- A show-of-skill talent show deal?
- Yeah.
Strutting their stuff.
A performance!
I think that's up my alley.
If it's tradition, I want to do it.
Strut my stuff.
Earn my mane.
I want to be Alaki.
- Alakay.
- Alakay!
Even better.
We will hold the rite of passage in the morning!
That's wonderful!
Good luck, Alakay.
Where I'm from, we say, "Break a leg. "
That's my boy!
I'm a private dancer
A dancer for money
Any old music will do
Beautiful, isn't it?
It's amazing.
Guys this is where we belong.
Operation Tourist Trap is a go.
Oh, I like that one.
It works on many levels.
You guys are a bunch of suck-ups.
- That, too.
- Absolutely.
Stations.
Stage one.
Go!
Oh, no!
What have I done?
Oome on, take the bait.
- What happened?
- Oh, look at the poor little guy.
Is it dead?
Stage two!
Go, go, go!
I will give him the kiss of life.
Rico!
Rico!
Reverse!
Gas!
Music!
No!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Oome back!
What is all this rock'n'roll racket?
!
Is she dead?
No!
You hoodlums!
Good heavens!
Are you OK?
Lady, I found your pocketbook.
My handbag.
Such a good boy.
Nana can't survive without it.
You are one tough cookie.
Brownies Troop 416, Yonkers.
OK, nobody panic!
The best thing we can do is stay together.
We'll wait for another tourjeep.
It may take hours, but...
Where are you going?
I'm not staying here to be attacked by more animals!
I'm too old to die.
I'm going with her.
Old lady, wait up!
Please!
We need to stay together.
Fine!
We'll go that way!
Does anyone want a hard candy?
- Easy now.
- Watch your step.
And right here...
OK, are you ready?
This is where you always slept.
Oh, man!
- Was this mine?
- Look at you.
Look at him.
Oh, this thing.
Look, look!
- I remember this!
- He remembers.
A little harder than...
You never slept on the right end.
You always slept on the bottom end.
Is that...?
Is that my...?
Is that me?
You had the cutest little paws.
Little, little bitty ol' paws.
You did that the day we lost you.
Wow.
I was so young.
What happened to me?
It was all my fault.
I turned my back and...
It was not your fault.
Your father did everything he could.
He tracked those hunters for weeks.
Far off the reserve.
Finally, I had to assume the hunters well...
We thought they'd killed you.
But my son fought them off!
Don't mess with the King of New York!
- That's right!
- Keep your chin in.
You boys be careful!
Watch out before you break something.
You used to call this "foofie. "
"Foofie"?
Foofie.
He doesn't want that.
This is my foofie!
Zuba, you better give him his foofie.
I mean, no, thank you, thank you.
It's perfect.
Son, you get your rest.
You have a big day tomorrow.
You'll need all your strength.
I will bring the house down for you.
I hope so.
Otherwise, your father will have to banish you.
Jeez, Mom, really?
I know you'll do us proud.
You know why?
You were born with it.
Good night, Alakay.
My boy.
My own boy.
My son's a king.
My son's a king.
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Alakay.
Foofie.
Look at foofie!
My foofie!
Foofie, foofie, foofie.
My foofie!
No sign of civilization.
Everybody appears very tired.
I think we're lost.
Nana, do you know where you're going?
No, but I'm going with a skip in my step and a smile on my face.
Sure, right, OK.
Yeah, all right.
- It's people.
- How did you get here?
- Oan you help us?
We're lost.
- We're lost too.
It was awful.
A flash of black and white and they were gone.
They took the jeep!
- That happened to ourjeep too!
- What do we do?
How will we all survive?
No food, no water, no shelter.
What are we gonna do?
!
You can let nature get the best of you, or you can get the best of nature.
Gather 'round, children.
We're New Yorkers, right?
Yeah.
We survive the concrete jungle!
When we need food, we hunt for a decent hot dog stand.
- Am I right?
- She's right.
When we need shelter, we build skyscrapers.
- Exactly!
- When we need water, we build a dam.
We're New Yorkers, for crying out loud!
If we can make it there, we can make it anywhere!
I'm coming, King Julien!
Bad fishy!
Bad fishy!
No, shark, no!
Sit!
Why am I laughing?
We have all the parts we need, but we're slightly behind schedule.
- How slightly?
- Six to nine years.
- Sixty-nine years?
- No, six to nine years.
Private!
What happened to our thumbs?
Haven't seen them since yesterday.
Darn you, Darwin!
Nobody goes AWOL on my watch.
Private!
You're coming with me.
Rico!
You're coming with me!
- We'll bring them in for court martial.
- That won't be necessary!
We've recruited a few extra thumbs for you, Skipper.
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.
Oh, I doubt that.
Enough lollygagging.
Let's get to work.
There'll be three groups.
Group Alpha will do sheet metal fabrication.
Group Bronson handles assembly.
Group George Peppard, craft services.
Any questions?
Good!
Let's get to work.
I'd like to kiss you, monkey man.
All right, but you're so darn ugly.
Remember, little cub scouts, a great dance performance comes from the heart.
Straight from the heart, you'll never go wrong.
Sure, mister.
Hey, Alakay, I just happened to walk by, I thought I'd wish you luck.
- You're not nervous, are you?
- Nah, it's my thing.
In my opinion, the key to this is choosing the right competitor.
You mean, this is like a dance battle sort of thing?
- Like a dance-off?
- Sure.
Great.
I love that.
Freestyle.
Who'd be a good match for me?
Just to keep things interesting.
Well, I wish I could help, but that's strictly against our ancient tradition and all we hold sacred.
But if it was me out there...
I'd choose Teetsi.
Teetsi.
OK.
Sounds interesting.
Makunga, right?
Thank you.
Anything for Zuba's boy.
Go get 'em, tiger.
Shake it out.
A five, six, seven, eight.
Let's go, let's do this.
Let us begin the rite of passage ceremony.
- Oome on, baby!
Make Mama proud!
- Woman, I'm trying to take...
On it, Mom!
Who will be the first participant?
Me!
Oh!
Me, me, me!
Me!
Me!
Me!
Me, me!
Please, me?
How about you?
The tall, handsome one.
Yeah.
Ohoose your opponent.
Let me see.
I guess I'll pick Teetsi?
Teetsi?
Why did he pick Teetsi?
That's my boy!
He's got some gumption there!
Somebody, wake him up!
All right, so, Teetsi, come on.
Let's do this, huh?
Oome on, little tsetse fly.
Let's see your stuff.
Bring it.
- Let's dance!
- OK.
But let me warn you that I am a protégé of Fosse and Robbins!
Not "dance" dance!
Fight!
Dance fight!
You got it.
- Is he dancing?
- What's he doing?
I know that boy is not dancing.
This is even better than I thought.
Alakay, turn around!
No, Pop, it's hop, shuffle, ball change, hip swish, turn around.
Oh, no.
Alakay!
Are you hurt?
Yeah, I am.
Did I... did I win?
No, son.
How could this happen?
You told us you were a king.
A king does not get beat.
I am a king.
I'm the King of New York.
It's my stage name.
Like for when I perform.
Perform?
Oh, no, this is horrible!
Alakay has failed the test!
Who would have ever imagined that today Zuba would have to banish his own son?
Zuba, no.
Zuba, yes.
Sadly, the alpha lion must cast out all failures.
Then I'm no longer the alpha lion.
Dad, what are you doing?
Dad, no!
You can't do this.
Who could possibly take Zuba's place?
Anyone?
Someone?
No one?
You, sir!
I guess not.
Well, I... this is all very awkward, but I suppose I could carry this tremendous burden.
Teetsi!
Get the hat.
As your new leader, I hereby banish Alakay!
He shall wear this Hat of Shame and leave the watering hole for a thousand years, or life!
Whichever comes last.
Shoo, shoo!
Get out of here!
You should have told us you weren't a real king, son!
You never told me I'd have to fight anybody!
What did you expect?
!
I don't know!
Maybe a little fatherly advice like, "Hey, son, it's a fight!"
- You're a lion!
- But I never fought another lion!
No, I guess not.
You dance!
And other stuff!
Your pal, Makunga, set me up back there!
- None of this would have happened...
- If you were a real lion.
- Zuba!
- Yeah, I said it!
A real lion.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Saw.
Suture.
Swab.
You're in my light, Stephen.
You have a brown spot on your shoulder.
That's very observant, Stephen.
As you can see, I'm covered in brown spots.
OK!
That bone will be good as new in a few weeks.
So I don't have to pick out a dying hole?
No, you got your whole life ahead of you.
- Really?
- Go out and grab it by the horns.
- Thank you, Dr. Mankiewicz!
- Break a leg!
Sweet kid.
This spot looks like Witch Doctor's Disease.
Witch Doctor's Disease?
That's the most ridiculous disease I've ever heard of.
- Don't ask.
- Someone's been knotty.
This won't hurt a bit.
Joe, our last witch doctor, had a spotjust like that.
- And?
- Monday, Joe.
Wednesday, no Joe.
Wednesday, no Joe?
I can breathe!
Thanks, doc!
So this Witch Doctor's Disease is a real thing?
You'll find a cure.
You've got at least 48 hours!
But I've never heard of it.
I mean...
I don't have any penicillin.
I'll need a OAT scan just to get started!
Have a lion look you over.
They'd be happy to.
Ta-da!
- He has talent.
- Stupendous and tremendous.
Hollah!
Bet you've never seen that one!
Knocked 'em dead in New York!
- Let's all give it a try!
- Let's do it!
Well, you can try all you want to, but it takes years of practice.
You'll never get a tight stream until you build up your lip muscles to the point where you can purse your lips like this.
You got it?
Ta-da!
How did you...?
You guys got it right out of the box!
- If you can do it...
... we can do it.
It's in our blood!
I always thought I was a bit unique.
We are unique!
We are like a force of nature!
- A million points of light!
- And dark stripes!
Exactly the same!
Exactly the same.
Looks impressive, Kowalski, but will it fly?
Yes.
If we fold it here, here and here.
Nice.
Oh, man.
My dad thinks I'm a total loser.
I've ruined my parents' lives.
That is definitely not crack-a-lackin'.
It is lacking' in the cracking', my friend.
I've gotta fix this.
So there's...
There's something I gotta tell you.
Hey, guys.
Is this place great or what?
!
I'd go with "or what. "
Well, I'll tell you what.
You're not gonna believe it, but I got a date with Moto Moto.
Who's Moto Moto?
Oh, he's so big and handsome and big!
- Know what "Moto Moto" means?
- Twins?
It means, "Hot Hot. "
"Hot Hot"?
When did you start parlez-ing African?
It's in my blood.
Don't worry, you can flirt around with Mr. Hot Pants after I'm gone.
Melman, why am I the parade and you're the rain?
Why are you driving your parade under my rain?
Maybe I'll parade in another part of town!
Whoa, guys.
Main Street's mine!
Well, you can have it!
And you can take your hotee-tot float and Mr. Hotee Moto Moto...
- What are you talking about?
- What are we talking about?
Melman, just tell her.
What?
What are you...
I don't know what you're talking about.
I guess I'll go, then.
Don't bother.
- Don't get up on my account.
- Melman!
Gloria!
- I thought you guys were friends!
- Marty's absolutely right.
- Marty?
- Marty?
Marty?
What the heck is going on?
You're not...?
Oh!
He was...
I thought he...
You're not him.
He's...
Oh.
You thought that guy was me?
No.
I mean, yes, you...
Guys, come on.
You thought I was him?
You guys kind of do look a little...
You look a lot alike.
Marty, you look a lot alike.
You laugh alike.
Talk alike.
He has the same speech pattern.
It's a little weird, really.
I mean, come on.
Marty.
So you're saying there's nothing unique about me.
I'm just like any other zebra.
No.
Of course you're different!
How?
OK, I can't tell you apart.
Maybe you could wear a bell or something.
- A bell?
!
- OK, not a bell.
Bell's a bad idea.
How about a T-shirt that says, "I'm with stupid"?
- I'm not stupid!
- Not you, stupid!
Him, stupid!
You know, while you've been doing the prancing pony with your new posse,
I've been having the worst day of my life.
It's always about you, isn't it?
My problems are just a little bit bigger than yours.
I couldn't tell you apart.
So what?
!
Yeah, fine.
Run away, Marty!
Run away!
That's what you do best!
Just like back in New York!
I'm right here.
But you can't tell that, right?
Your one-of-a-million friend hopes you enjoy your bigger-than-anyone-else's problems alone!
Good, leave!
I don't need you to help me solve my problems!
You're a dime a dozen!
I can't tell which one's Marty!
Which one's Marty?
Wait a minute.
Oh, yeah, I don't care!
Nice hat, you showoff!
Marty don't go.
Giddy-up, giddy-up!
Look, Maurice!
The perfect spot for my summer palace!
Please fill in all these holes and relocate the riff-raff.
- Who'd leave a perfectly good head?
- What a waste.
Tell me about it.
I'm in my prime here.
I'm terminal, you know?
I probably only have another two days left to live.
That's a bummer, man.
If I, King Julien... that's my name only had two days left to live,
I would do all the things
- I've ever dreamed of doing.
- Like what?
I'd love to become a professional whistler.
I'm pretty amazing at it now, but I want to get even better, make my living out of it.
You know what else I would do?
I would invade a neighboring country and impose my own ideology, even if they didn't want it!
Easy for you to say.
You're a king.
Yes.
And you are only just a sad little head.
There must be something you want to do before you die!
- There is this one thing.
- What?
Tell me.
- No, I couldn't.
- What is it?
I never told Gloria how I feel about her.
What is it?
Please tell me!
I never had the guts to tell Gloria how I feel about her.
How I've always felt about her.
Fine.
Don't tell me!
Is it a woman?
You didn't tell me it's a woman.
What are you afraid of?
You're a dead man anyway.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're right.
You've got to march right up to this woman.
Look her right in the eye.
Lean forward.
Just a little, or almost all the way.
Then you let her lean forward a little until you're just lips' distance away from each other.
Then you tell her how much you hate her.
Actually, it's more like love her.
Oh, you sly dog!
Woof, woof!
You're a real player.
Now listen to me.
You got to rise up.
You hearing me?
- He didn't hear you.
- I can't hear you!
- You got to rise up!
- Rising up!
- Get out of the hole!
- I'm rising out of the ground!
- He's rising, Maurice.
- I'm rising, Maurice!
- Rising!
- You go right up to this woman!
Do you feel it?
- Go up to her face!
- Tell the truth!
- I'm going to tell her!
- Then you say, "Baby, I dig you!"
Yeah!
I'm going to do it!
I'm going to do it!
I love that happy little head.
She love
Moto Moto
She love
Moto Moto
She loves me She loves my eyes
She loves me She loves my thighs
She loves my roundness
She love that I'm chunky She love that I'm plumpy
She love my heftiness She love my zestiness
She love me restlessly She love me forever
She love me 'cause she love me
Moto Moto before things get too serious, well,
I was wondering, if I were to, for example, stay here I'd like to ask you...
Let your candied lips be the messengers to my... ear canal.
I have so many questions.
I promise the answer will always be yes.
Unless no is required.
So what is it about me that you find so interesting?
You're the most plumpenest girl I've ever met.
OK.
Other than that.
Let's see.
Yeah, well, you know... you chunky.
Right.
My gosh, girl, you huge.
You said that.
Yeah, that's right.
We don't have to talk no more.
Gloria!
Gloria.
Melman.
Melman, I want you to meet Moto Moto.
Moto Moto.
Yeah, nice to meet you.
- I guess I...
- It's OK, Melman.
Apology accepted.
Oh.
Yeah, right, that.
That's why I...
Good.
OK.
Well, that's it, then.
Good.
We're kind of busy here, man.
No.
No, that's not it.
Listen, Mototo, you better treat this lady like a queen.
Because you, my friend, you found yourself the perfect woman.
If I was ever so lucky to find the perfect woman,
I'd give her flowers every day.
And notjust any flowers.
OK?
Her favorites are orchids.
White.
And breakfast in bed.
Six loaves of wheat toast, butter on both sides.
No crust, the way she likes it.
I'd be her shoulder to cry on and her best friend.
I'd spend every day thinking of how to make her laugh.
She has the most amazing laugh.
That's what I would do if I were you.
But I'm not, so you do it.
OK.
What?
That was beautiful.
Anyways, where were we?
I'm "huge"?
Surprised to see me, Makunga?
Well, I'm here to set things straight, like a real lion!
Is this real enough for you?
How about this?
This is for setting me up!
This is for stealing my dad's job!
This is for humiliating my family!
And making me look like a fool!
Had enough?
Sure, fly away!
Ooward.
The water.
It's gone.
It's never gone dry before.
- We'll need a lot more dying holes.
- How could this happen?
Out of my way!
What is going on here?
!
The watering hole is dry!
There's barely water for one of us!
- Good observation, Shirley.
- I'm Bobby.
Makunga, what do we do?
Quiet!
Listen up!
I'm afraid there is only one solution to this horrible crisis:
We'll all have to fight for it.
- We can't fight for it.
- That's crazy.
That's not fair.
You'd win!
Exactly, Shirley.
I'm Bob...
Sorry, folks, but life isn't fair.
I'm in charge now, thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion.
Please, Makunga, this is the only water on the reserve.
If you're thirsty, you'll have to look for water off the reserve.
- Off the reserve?
- It's too dangerous!
Hunters would shoot us!
No one leaves the reserve and survives!
I left the reserve!
And survived.
I can do something about this.
Looks like a clogged pipe, like we get in New York.
I'll travel upriver...
- Upriver?
- Off the reserve?
You?
Yeah.
I'll unclog the pipe and bring back your water.
Great!
I'd help you pack, but by the looks of that hat, I see you're all set!
Fine.
Go ahead, laugh.
Laugh your mane off.
I'll prove you wrong.
Maybe you should try a little rain dance.
Zuba would know what to do.
- Where's Zuba?
- You don't care about us.
Zuba should be in charge, not you.
All right, fine!
As an added measure, I will consult with Zuba!
Marty?
Hey!
Marty!
Marty?
Marty.
Where'd you get the fruity hat?
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
Hi.
Is Marty in there?
Anyone seen Marty?
Which one of us is Marty?
All right.
Well, if you see him, tell him his friend Alex came to say goodbye.
Goodbye?
Don't go.
Where are you going?
- Oan we come?
- No.
I have to do this alone.
You can't leave the reserve!
What are you doing?
- They'll get your hat.
- Hunters are everywhere!
Oould you leave the hat?
Marty!
I know you're in there.
Before I go, I got something I want to say.
You've been a great friend.
You've helped me so often to see the bright side of my problems that I never think of you having any.
I wasn't there for you when you needed me.
Just like back at the zoo.
What kind of friend does that make me?
A pretty lousy friend, I guess.
I just want you to know that I...
You're one in a million.
This is touching.
It is touching.
So could you turn around so I can tell you to your face?
That's right.
Gotcha!
I see you in there!
Yeah, you.
You, right there.
Twelfth row, two hundred and third from the left.
That's you, Marty.
I know it's you.
Know what makes you special?
These guys are white with black stripes.
You're black with white stripes.
You're a dreamer, Marty.
Always have been.
You have great taste in music and horrible taste in friends.
Well, not Melman and Gloria, but me.
OK, I'm in.
Marty, you can't come with me.
You don't have a choice.
- People are out there!
- You're crazy!
Oome back!
The people will get you!
Don't lose the hat!
Bye, hat!
Any water?
No, just more diamonds and gold.
Don't give up hope.
Listen up!
I will help you!
There's only one way to get your precious water.
I, your beloved King Julien must simply make a small sacrifice to my good friends, the water gods, in the volcano!
What does that do?
What does that do?
Excellent question.
My sacrifice goes in the volcano.
The friendly gods eat up my sacrifice.
"Thank you for the sacrifice. "
"Here, have another. " "No, I've had enough. "
"I'll be insulted unless you have another. "
"I don't want another sacrifice!"
"Look at you!
You're skinny!" "No!
I've had enough!"
The gods eat the sacrifice.
They are grateful.
They give me some water, and then I give it to you.
What?
Does it work?
No!
I mean, yes.
Well, Maurice?
Ah, it's fifty-fifty.
We'll do it!
Excellent!
Now all I need is someone who would like to go into the volcano and get eaten by gods.
Any hands!
Hands, anybody!
I need someone, perhaps who has never found love, who could look death straight in the eyeball.
A real, genuine hero.
- I'll do it.
- Melman?
Hurry up!
Before we all come to our senses!
Melman, what is wrong with you?
I'm dying anyway.
If there's a chance it'll get you water, it's worth it.
Are you nuts?
I want you to know, back at the zoo, it was never the doctors or prescriptions that kept me going.
It was always you.
Seeing you every day.
That's what kept me going.
Melman!
Wait!
Melman!
Melman!
Melman!
You going to mope like this all day?
Don't "hmph" me.
Listen, Zuba.
A miracle happened.
Our son came back to us.
How come that is not good enough for you?
What are you saying, woman?
We lost him once, Zuba.
Let's not lose him again.
Zuba!
- Zuba!
- Get out of here!
What do you want?
It's awful.
The watering hole is dried up.
Dried up?
That's impossible!
There's nothing left!
You're alpha lion, Makunga.
What are you gonna do about it?
Your son, Alakay, he said he could fix it.
He's gone upriver.
- Off the reserve?
!
- No!
I tried to stop him.
I told him it was suicide.
He was determined to prove himself to you.
You stay here, in case he comes back!
Hurry, Zuba!
I'm so parched.
Is this place starting to freak you out?
We'll slip in, find the problem.
Hunters will never know we were here.
Why are we doing this?
Maybe my dad will think I'm...
I want to show him I'm a real lion.
As opposed to a chocolate lion.
I know this may sound hard to believe, but apparently, lions don't dance.
What?
!
As far as my dad is concerned.
As far as people are concerned, you're a hit.
In New York.
This is Africa...
much tougher crowd.
Marty, this is it!
This is the clog!
Oome on.
Well, there's the water.
Stay down.
Look at that.
Knit one, purl two.
It's her.
- Is this right?
- Very good.
Nana, slow down.
You're a little tangled, aren't you?
No, don't pull.
I'll do it.
We need dynamite.
Got any?
Oh, snap!
I just used my last stick this morning!
- Savages!
- Evasive maneuvers!
- Serpentine, serpentine!
- Squiggly squid maneuver!
Zag, zig-zag, zig ziggy zag!
No, no!
Squiggly squid!
Etch A Sketch!
That's too complex!
Octopus, octopus!
- Run, Marty!
- I can't leave you here!
Go get help!
Squiggly squid maneuver!
Go!
Go!
Squiggly squid!
Etch A Sketch!
Etch A Sketch!
Save us We love you
OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- Save us
- Melman
- We love you
- Melman
Save us
OK, here we go.
OK, OK.
- Melman
- We love you
- Melman
- Save us
Here we go!
Here we go!
- What's all the hoopla about?
- Joe?
Joe the Witch Doctor?
We thought you were dead!
So did I. Then I realized I'm covered in brown spots.
So Melman's not dying!
- Melman's not dying!
- Oh, no!
Melman!
Move!
Don't do this!
Julien, stop this!
This is crazy!
Oh, suddenly throwing a giraffe into a volcano to make water is crazy!
Yes!
- Please, Melman!
Stop!
- Gloria?
- You can't do this!
- Why not?
Because...
You can't do this, Melman.
First, that hurts.
Second, I've only got 18 hours to live, anyway.
Melman, I gotta know did you mean those things you said about me?
Of course I did.
- That's crazy.
- It is?
It's crazy to think I had to go halfway around the world to find out the perfect guy for me lived right next door.
Then it's you and me, neighbor.
You and me for the next 18 hours.
I'll take whatever you got.
- Maurice, what happened?
- I believe the fat lady has sung.
- What's going on here?
- Marty!
Alex is in big trouble!
We got to get upriver fast!
- What about the plane?
- Perfect!
Oome on!
The plane won't be fixed until the suits meet our demands.
Now, maternity leave.
Maternity leave?
You're all males.
We need that plane for a rescue mission.
There's nothing I can do until we bust up this union.
I'll bust up all of you if you don't get this plane going.
Oan't you see these commies have my hands tied?
No maternity leave.
Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want these blowing around on the savanna.
All right.
You get your maternity leave.
Finally.
Where we headed?
What's going on?
Where are we going?
Oh, no!
Please!
Don't put me there!
No!
This is wrong.
You see?
You are survivors.
Now, how about a nice lion casserole?
You can't eat a lion.
Don't worry, it tastes like chicken.
No, no, no.
Don't listen to her.
She's out of her mind, people!
I'm from New York Oity!
It's me, Alex the lion!
From Oentral Park!
Dad!
What were you thinking, son?
You got no business being out here!
Stay behind me.
They're New Yorkers.
They're just rude and frightened people.
Stay back!
You'd let your dinner get away?
- What are you doing?
- The only thing I know how to do.
What the heck?
Hey, I know those moves.
Alex?
- It's Alex the lion!
- From Oentral Park!
It is Alex!
Only one lion can move like that!
He's beautiful.
I can't believe it.
How does he do that?
What are you doing?
I'm dancing with my son!
I think.
Don't think, Dad.
Feel!
Butterfly!
I'm feeling it!
I'm feeling it!
Roar!
That was beautiful.
Now let's eat!
Dad, look out!
What the...
Alex!
Get in!
She's got a gun!
Get out while we can!
- What?
- She's got a gun!
Get out while we can!
Pass it on!
He said let's have some fun and take out the dam.
Basset hound.
Skipper!
Alex wants to take out the dam.
All right!
But it's his funeral.
- Hard to port!
- Aye-aye, Skippy!
Bring it on!
Bring it on!
Oome back!
That's my dinner!
Kowalski, full throttle.
Music!
- I like this song.
- It never gets old.
It does have a catchy hook.
Oome about!
Bring her in low!
Hold onto your skirts!
It's dam-busting time!
Hold on tight, baby!
Here we go!
Tell them no!
Pull up!
They'll kill us!
There's got to be another way!
Pass it on!
They say no pull up.
Kill us.
There's no other way.
Basset hound.
Are you sure?
Men, there is no sacrifice greater than someone else's.
No!
Medic!
Ramming speed!
Bring it on!
Bad kitties.
I don't know why the sacrifice didn't work.
The science seemed so solid.
I'd jump right in that volcano if I wasn't so good at whistling.
It's you!
I found you!
Mort?
Bad fishy!
I wonder if the gods like seafood.
Let's find out.
Look, Maurice.
- That was quick.
- I did it!
I did it!
I did it!
Ok, you did it!
Oh, yes!
Look!
- It's Alakay!
- It's Zuba!
You did it!
Alakay, Zuba, you did it!
Zuba!
Alakay!
You're back!
I'm so glad you're safe!
Out of my way.
Well, well, well.
You know, Zuba, if I remember correctly, you quit the pride.
And you were kicked out.
So don't think that this changes anything.
You're right.
In fact, we humbly present you with this token of appreciation.
A man bag.
Very popular where I'm from.
- Don't know what to say.
- Still be tough and carry your stuff.
Does the strap adjust?
This will go very nicely for me when I go out hiking.
But you're still banished.
We figured you'd say that.
My handbag!
You bad kitty!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
You deserve this, son.
Welcome to the pride.
Thanks, Dad.
But this belongs to you.
No, son.
To us!
My son!
The King of New York!
That's my baby!
Love transcends all differences.
We are gathered here today to celebrate such a love.
Do you take each other, for better or for worse?
For better, please.
What a beautiful, weird couple!
That's not going to last.
Oan I kiss the bride?
No!
Music!
- Struts.
- Oheck.
- Flaps!
- Oheck.
- Diamonds and gold.
- Oheck.
- Bye-bye!
- We'll miss you!
See you later!
We'll be back after the honeymoon in Monte Oarlo, or whenever the gold runs out.
Oome back soon!
Mom, let them take their time.
New York isn't going anywhere, right, guys?
You're right about that!
As long as I'm with her and you two, I don't care where we are.
She has the most amazing laugh.
Love has no boundaries!
Looks like you're stuck with us for a while.
Dad?
What's wrong?
I just thought we could hang out a bit and...
- You got me!
- I got you, son!
You got me with my thing.
You brought it back around on me.
I got you, son!
The old man's not too bad, eh, Marty?
- Marty?
Who's Marty?
- Oome on.
- I don't know no Marty.
- You can't fool me.
Ain't no Marty here.
Marty!
I can look into your eyes, and I know it's you.
See, I've been traveling Been traveling forever
But now that I found a home feels like I'm in heaven
See, I've been traveling Been traveling forever
But now that I'm home
Hey!
Shake the hot things!
Shake the hot things!
Shake 'em!
Shake 'em!
Shake 'em!
^*^ THE END ^*^
Well done, boys.
Looks like ice-cold sushi for breakfast.
No, no, son.
Over here.
See the lion?
Look at the lion and get the lion.
Now, son, if you're gonna grow up and be like your daddy someday, you gotta learn how to fight.
Da-da.
Now, Alakay, let me show you something, OK?
You see this mark?
You and me are the same.
When you're bigger, you'll be Alpha Lion, just like me.
Now let me see you fight.
Ready?
No, Alakay.
No dancing!
You just amuse yourself, don't you?
You're a strange kid.
You're a strange one.
I'm...
Now, come on, let's try it again.
No, Alakay.
Stop that right now.
Doggone it!
It's so disappointing when they don't grow up the way you want.
Makunga.
You're not challenging me again, are you?
Look on the bright side.
After I defeat you and become alpha lion, you'll have more time to spend with your pathetic son.
Before I kick your butt, let me ask you:
Why do you want to become the alpha lion?
I'm better looking, I have better hair, I'm deceivingly smart and I want everyone else to do what I say.
We fight on three.
One...
Pay attention, Alakay.
Daddy will show you how it's done.
Two, three!
- Who's the alpha lion?
- You are.
Don't you forget it.
And that, Alakay, is how you attack...
Alakay?
That's it.
Here, kitty, kitty.
This one's a beauty.
He'll be worth a few bucks.
It just gets easier and easier.
Daddy!
Alakay!
Alakay!
Alakay!
Da-da!
No!
No!
No!
Alakay!
- Daddy!
- Daddy's got you!
Hold on!
Da-da!
Alakay!
Daddy!
I've been around the world in the pouring rain
Feeling out of place and feeling strange
Take me to a place where they know my name
'Cause I ain't met nobody that looks the same
I'm a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle
He's a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle
I'm a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle
He's a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle
I need my peoples, my peoples Take me to my peoples
Play that jungle fever Show 'em some love
Show love
Just gotta have someone Gotta have someone
To relate to, to relate to
I'm feeling right at home
Feeling right at home Feeling right at home
Feeling right at home I'm feeling right at home
See I been traveling Been traveling forever...
- I don't like the looks of this guy.
- He's kind of cute.
He's kind of a showoff.
You think he's cute?
Roar!
The King of New York City Alex the Lion!
I still think he's kind of a showoff.
The guy's an animal.
Maybe he should take a break.
You know, we could all use a vacation.
Come on, where would we go on vacation?
I don't know about you, but I want to go to Connecticut!
On the loose, several animals, including the world famous Alex the Lion, escaped from the Central Park Zoo tonight.
The escapees were cornered in Grand Central Station.
He was a very bad kitty.
Animal rights activists, who convinced zoo officials to have the animals sent to Africa, were stunned to learn that the freighter carrying the animals was reported missing today.
Tonight, hundreds of New Yorkers have gathered at the zoo to mourn the loss of their beloved zoo animals.
The question on everyone's mind, where are they now?
I like to move it, move it
He likes to move it, move it
She likes to move it, move it
- We like to
- Move it!
Come on!
Y'all know this one!
It never gets stale!
- We like to
- Move it!
We'll miss you little fuzz buckets!
You've been a great crowd!
Glad we could introduce you to the toilet.
If you ever come look us up in Manhattan, feel free to call first.
Seriously though, call.
OK?
Settle down, everybody.
Be quiet!
You can't leave without this!
Surprise, freaks!
Shake it!
Shake it.
Look, I'm a lady!
I'm a lady, everyone!
I'm a lady!
Not really!
It's me, King Julien!
Which of you is attracted to me?
Hands up!
Hey, freaks!
You will be very glad to hear that I am coming with you.
Oh, no, thank you.
Yes, thank you.
It's my plane!
Until I return with the spoils from the new country Stevie will be in charge!
I don't think they like that idea.
What are you saying, Stevie?
No.
Could we?
No, you didn't say that!
How is that even possible?
Naughty little thing!
Stevie says...
Let them eat cake!
King Julien, wait for me!
I'm all packed!
I have a whole itinerary planned!
Oh, no!
It's Mort!
He's so annoying!
Don't let him on.
Stop that thing!
He's carrying scissors and hand cream!
Everybody in!
Quickly, get in, get in!
Get in quick!
- Struts.
- Check.
- Flaps.
- Check.
- Engine.
Coffee maker.
- Check.
You guys!
Oopsie-daisy!
That has to be the second biggest slingshot I've ever seen.
But it'll have to do.
Attention.
This is your captain speaking.
In the event of an emergency, place the vest over your head then kiss your... good-bye.
New York City, here we come!
Pray to your personal God this hunk of junk flies.
Personal God, hunk?
What?
We are go, sir.
Open the door!
I'm outside!
If cabin pressure is lost, place the mask over your face to hide your terrified expression.
Miss, aren't these supposed to be attached to my seat?
- No, sir.
- OK, boys, launch!
Launch!
- Launch!
- Launch!
Gremlin!
Hey, Mort.
Hi!
That was weird.
- Somebody's dreaming.
- I think I saw Mort on the plane wing.
You got Madagascar on the brain.
I know I'm gonna miss it.
It was incredible.
I think it'll seem more fun the further we are from it.
Like when you bit me on the butt?
I'm gonna take that thing you're holding onto and use it onstage.
It's all part of my little actor's salad bar of emotional tidbits.
Are the butts next to the croutons?
You don't need to be sarcastic.
When we get back, I might sign up for the breeding program.
Breeding program?
We reach a point when we want to meet somebody.
Settle down, have a relationship.
I can see that.
What?
Like dating?
Yeah, dating.
Other... other guys?
What do you mean, other guys?
Darn it!
What is holding up that beverage service?
!
I'm gonna go check.
You all keep talking.
I'm gonna catch a few winks.
It's so funny!
I like laughing!
It's such a nice experience!
To laugh!
Do you mind going back?
This is first class.
It's nothing personal.
We're just better than you.
Maurice, I'm open!
Hit me!
- He shoots, he scores!
- Is that Vivaldi?
- In-flight slave.
- Can I help you, Mr. Mankiewicz?
Bring my nuts on a silver platter.
We were checking on our drink order.
Sorry.
Been a little backed up.
- I guess I'll go back...
- Where's your body?
You're freaking me out!
Can you please go over there, please?
What happened to the separation of the classes?
I'm sure this democracy thing is just a fad.
We'll go out for pineapple, my bobbly-headed boobily-boo.
Skipper, look.
Analysis.
Looks like a small bulb used to indicate something unusual, like a malfunction.
I find it pretty and somewhat hypnotic.
That too, sir.
Right!
Rico?
Manual!
Problemo solved.
- We may be out of fuel.
- Why do you think so?
We've lost engine one and engine two is no longer on fire.
Buckle up, boys.
Don't look, doll.
This might get hairy.
Attention!
This is your captain.
I have good and bad news.
The good news is, we're landing immediately.
The bad news is, we're crash-landing.
When it comes to air travel, we know you have no choice.
But thanks for choosing Air Penguin.
Raise your arms, Maurice!
It's more fun when you raise your arms!
I can fly!
This could be it, Marty!
I want you to know you are a one-in-a-million friend!
Thanks, buddy!
You're the best ever!
- And you won't mind when I tell you...
- Tell me anything!
I broke your iPod!
The buttons were so small!
It made me mad!
- The horror!
- I'm sorry!
- I'll kill you, butt-biter!
- It was an accident!
- An accident!
- Butt-biter!
I love you, Gloria!
I always have!
Like you love the beach.
Or a good book.
Or the beach.
Goodness, doll, you're shaking like a leaf.
Rico, you've had your fun.
Pull up.
Gear down.
Gently.
You just want to kiss the ground.
Just a peck, a smooch, like you'd kiss your sister.
I said, kiss it!
Now just a little brake.
Just a touch.
I believe that's checkmate.
Commence emergency landing procedure.
Flaps up!
Deploy!
Oh, we're here.
What in the world?
What happened to the plane?
What did y'all do to the plane?
I'm OK.
I'm alive.
I can't even sleep for a minute.
This is not JFK.
Kowalski, casualty report.
Two passengers unaccounted for.
That's a number I can live with.
Good landing, boys.
Who says a penguin can't fly?
Hey, happy slappers!
Is there some reason to celebrate?
Look at the plane!
- We'll fix it.
- How are you gonna fix this?
Grit, spit and a whole lot of duct tape.
We should be up and running in, say, six to nine months.
- Sixty-nine months?
!
- No, six to nine months.
Kowalski, I say we use this setback to our advantage.
- Where'd you get that number?
- I want you to reconfigure the design.
How do you estimate that?
Pretty boy!
Why don't you and your friends dig a latrine.
Hold on.
Who made you king of the plane wreck?
Excuse me?
Fine.
You can be in charge.
You fix the plane.
Who gives you the authority to put me in charge?
OK, then I'll remain in charge.
Yeah, you will remain in charge.
You and your hippie friends stay out of our hair.
Correcto-mundo.
Because I decided to.
- Good for you.
- Well, this discussion isn't over.
Higher mammals!
Stay with us.
We could use your front cortexes and opposable thumbs.
Phil!
I should wash your hands out with soap.
How in the hell-o will they fix this plane?
!
You know, grit and spit and spit.
A lot of spit and grit and stick-to-it-iveness.
That don't sound too promising.
You're right.
We're stuck here.
As long as we're together, we'll be OK.
Yeah, but love ain't gonna get us home.
Behold!
The lion!
- People!
- There is much to see.
Moving on.
Wait, wait, wait!
People!
- They'll help us!
- Wait up!
- People!
Stop!
- Help us!
If you stop, I'll autograph those!
I know you!
You.
It's the bad kitty.
How do you like some of that?
!
Come in, Tokyo!
Right in the batteries.
You think an old lady can't take care of herself?
Next time, I won't go so easy on you!
Thank you, dear.
Moving on!
Are you out of your mind?
We need help and you harass old ladies?
!
Out of my mind?
Who's out of my mind now?
- See if you can get an operator.
- No problem.
Out of my mind.
We're going home.
Message E-4.
The service user has roamed outside the coverage area.
Please try again later.
Am I trippin'?
All those zebras...
like me.
- Where are we?
- San Diego.
This time I'm 40 percent sure.
- I know this place.
- I think it's Africa.
Africa?
It's got to be.
Our ancestral crib.
It's in our blood.
I can feel it!
No, it's more than that.
It's like déjà vu, like I've been here before.
It's like Roots!
No, it's like déjà vu, like I've been here before.
How!
How!
Me Alex!
Me and me friends fly, fly in great metal bird.
Then plummet!
Smash ground!
Go boom!
Then here we emerge.
We offer only happiness and good greetings.
Is he dancing about a plane crash?
Yeah.
We just... yeah.
I thought...
Sorry.
You came from off the reserve?
Way off.
From the Central Park Zoo, actually.
Don't strain yourself.
What's going on here?
They say they're from off the reserve.
That's impossible.
Only people come from off the reserve.
You look familiar.
Do I know you?
How could you survive the hunters?
We didn't see any hunters.
- What are you looking at?
- Me?
Nothing.
This watering hole doesn't need any more mouths to feed.
So skedaddle back to where you came from.
Is there a manager we could talk to?
I see.
You're here to challenge me!
What?
No!
No.
That's what it looks like to me!
Zuba!
Wait.
I'm trying to take care of business...
Yeah, yeah, Zuba.
Hold on.
Alakay?
Is that you?
No, it's Alex. lx.
Like New York Knicks.
Zuba, look!
I've always had that.
The vet checked it out.
It's kind of a beauty spot, really.
A mark.
All right, this is a little weird.
Honey, he's come home.
What?
You've come home.
Son.
Dad.
Mom and Dad?
Mom and Dad!
Mom and Dad!
It's my mom and dad!
I got a mom and dad!
My baby's alive!
Dad!
My son!
My son is home!
Alakay!
Alakay has come home!
Alakay!
Yeah!
The prodigal son returns.
This is perfect!
I thought you hated Zuba.
No, I do.
I do.
I do.
I hate him.
Oh, I do.
And I'm going to use Alakay, yes.
I'm going to use him to get rid of Zuba once and for all!
Giddy-up, feathered horse!
Make way!
Move out of the way!
Stand aside!
New York!
It's a bit of a dump.
Are you sure we're not in New Jersey?
Hello, New Yorkers!
Your new king is here!
This calls for a celebration!
Maurice, I think they like me.
You've got to love a non-hostile takeover!
Chukka-chukka what?
Excuse me.
I'm Marty.
I'm kind of new around here.
Hey, Marty!
You're a good-looking group!
You like to run?
Yeah.
Running is crack-a-lackin'.
That's right!
Crack-a-lackin'.
You guys speak my crack-a-lackin' language.
What?
You don't have doctors here?
Not anymore.
Well, what if you catch a cold?
We go over to the dying holes and we die.
You guys really need a doctor.
- We have an opening.
- Would you be interested?
Me?
A doctor?
It's raining men.
Hallelujah!
You all got it going on.
Why don't you have a man?
You got worms?
Oh, I got rid of those.
Listen, girls.
Manhattan is short on two things, parking and hippos.
Hey, everybody!
I just found out that my son is a doggone king!
The King of New York!
Show me some of your moves, son.
Don't be bashful.
All right.
This one always knocks 'em dead.
Roar!
Look out.
The King is mad.
The King is mad!
Let's welcome him back into the pride with open arms!
Welcome to the herd, Marty!
Me?
I've always wanted to be part of a herd!
- It's one for all...
- [all] And all for all, y'all!
How do I look?
Technically, a traditional witch doctor has a bone through his nose.
Don't worry... it's just a clip-on.
Voilà!
He's a witch doctor!
My mother will be so happy.
Look out!
I think Moto Moto likes you.
Here he comes.
I like 'em big
I like 'em chunky
I like 'em big I like 'em plumpy
I like 'em round With something' somethin'
They like my sound They think I'm funky
Goodness, girl... you huge.
Who's your friend?
Or is that your butt?
You as quick as you are hefty.
So you're Moto Moto?
The name's so nice, you say it twice.
I kind of like it, fatso.
I'll see you around, girl.
It won't be hard, because you so... plumpy.
Oops!
I hate to be a party pooper, Zuba, but some of the lions were wondering when you plan to banish your son.
- What are you talking about?
- It's nothing, really.
They're griping that Alakay never went through the rite of passage, blah, blah, blah, so technically speaking, he can't be a member of the pride.
It's nonsense.
I forgot about the rite of passage.
What is it?
What's this rite of passage?
A traditional coming-of-age ceremony.
Young lions earn their manes by demonstrating their skills.
- A show-of-skill talent show deal?
- Yeah.
Strutting their stuff.
A performance!
I think that's up my alley.
If it's tradition, I want to do it.
Strut my stuff.
Earn my mane.
I want to be Alaki.
- Alakay.
- Alakay!
Even better.
We will hold the rite of passage in the morning!
That's wonderful!
Good luck, Alakay.
Where I'm from, we say, "Break a leg."
That's my boy!
I'm a private dancer
A dancer for money
Any old music will do
Beautiful, isn't it?
It's amazing.
Guys this is where we belong.
Operation Tourist Trap is a go.
Oh, I like that one.
It works on many levels.
You guys are a bunch of suck-ups.
- That, too.
- Absolutely.
Stations.
Stage one.
Go!
Oh, no!
What have I done?
Come on, take the bait.
- What happened?
- Oh, look at the poor little guy.
Is it dead?
Stage two!
Go, go, go!
I will give him the kiss of life.
Rico!
Rico!
Reverse!
Gas!
Music!
No!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Come back!
What is all this rock'n'roll racket?
!
Is she dead?
No!
You hoodlums!
Good heavens!
Are you OK?
Lady, I found your pocketbook.
My handbag.
Such a good boy.
Nana can't survive without it.
You are one tough cookie.
Brownies Troop 416, Yonkers.
OK, nobody panic!
The best thing we can do is stay together.
We'll wait for another tour jeep.
It may take hours, but...
Where are you going?
I'm not staying here to be attacked by more animals!
I'm too old to die.
I'm going with her.
Old lady, wait up!
Please!
We need to stay together.
Fine!
We'll go that way!
Does anyone want a hard candy?
- Easy now.
- Watch your step.
And right here...
OK, are you ready?
This is where you always slept.
Oh, man!
- Was this mine?
- Look at you.
Look at him.
Oh, this thing.
Look, look!
- I remember this!
- He remembers.
A little harder than...
You never slept on the right end.
You always slept on the bottom end.
Is that?
Is that my?
Is that me?
You had the cutest little paws.
Little, little bitty ol' paws.
You did that the day we lost you.
Wow.
I was so young.
What happened to me?
It was all my fault.
I turned my back and...
It was not your fault.
Your father did everything he could.
He tracked those hunters for weeks.
Far off the reserve.
Finally, I had to assume the hunters well...
We thought they'd killed you.
But my son fought them off!
Don't mess with the King of New York!
- That's right!
- Keep your chin in.
You boys be careful!
Watch out before you break something.
You used to call this "foofie."
"Foofie"?
Foofie.
He doesn't want that.
This is my foofie!
Zuba, you better give him his foofie.
I mean, no, thank you, thank you.
It's perfect.
Son, you get your rest.
You have a big day tomorrow.
You'll need all your strength.
I will bring the house down for you.
I hope so.
Otherwise, your father will have to banish you.
Jeez, Mom, really?
I know you'll do us proud.
You know why?
You were born with it.
Good night, Alakay.
My boy.
My own boy.
My son's a king.
My son's a king.
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Alakay.
Foofie.
Look at foofie!
My foofie!
Foofie, foofie, foofie.
My foofie!
No sign of civilization.
Everybody appears very tired.
I think we're lost.
Nana, do you know where you're going?
No, but I'm going with a skip in my step and a smile on my face.
Sure, right, OK.
Yeah, all right.
- It's people.
- How did you get here?
- Can you help us?
We're lost.
- We're lost too.
It was awful.
A flash of black and white and they were gone.
They took the jeep!
- That happened to our jeep too!
- What do we do?
How will we all survive?
No food, no water, no shelter.
What are we gonna do?
!
You can let nature get the best of you, or you can get the best of nature.
Gather 'round, children.
We're New Yorkers, right?
Yeah.
We survive the concrete jungle!
When we need food, we hunt for a decent hot dog stand.
- Am I right?
- She's right.
When we need shelter, we build skyscrapers.
- Exactly!
- When we need water, we build a dam.
We're New Yorkers, for crying out loud!
If we can make it there, we can make it anywhere!
I'm coming, King Julien!
Bad fishy!
Bad fishy!
No, shark, no!
Sit!
Why am I laughing?
We have all the parts we need, but we're slightly behind schedule.
- How slightly?
- Six to nine years.
- Sixty-nine years?
- No, six to nine years.
Private!
What happened to our thumbs?
Haven't seen them since yesterday.
Darn you, Darwin!
Nobody goes AWOL on my watch.
Private!
You're coming with me.
Rico!
You're coming with me!
- We'll bring them in for court martial.
- That won't be necessary!
We've recruited a few extra thumbs for you, Skipper.
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.
Oh, I doubt that.
Enough lollygagging.
Let's get to work.
There'll be three groups.
Group Alpha will do sheet metal fabrication.
Group Bronson handles assembly.
Group George Peppard, craft services.
Any questions?
Good!
Let's get to work.
I'd like to kiss you, monkey man.
All right, but you're so darn ugly.
Remember, little cub scouts, a great dance performance comes from the heart.
Straight from the heart, you'll never go wrong.
Sure, mister.
Hey, Alakay, I just happened to walk by, I thought I'd wish you luck.
- You're not nervous, are you?
- Nah, it's my thing.
In my opinion, the key to this is choosing the right competitor.
You mean, this is like a dance battle sort of thing?
- Like a dance-off?
- Sure.
Great.
I love that.
Freestyle.
Who'd be a good match for me?
Just to keep things interesting.
Well, I wish I could help, but that's strictly against our ancient tradition and all we hold sacred.
But if it was me out there...
I'd choose Teetsi.
Teetsi.
OK.
Sounds interesting.
Makunga, right?
Thank you.
Anything for Zuba's boy.
Go get 'em, tiger.
Shake it out.
A five, six, seven, eight.
Let's go, let's do this.
Let us begin the rite of passage ceremony.
- Come on, baby!
Make Mama proud!
- Woman, I'm trying to take...
On it, Mom!
Who will be the first participant?
Me!
Oh!
Me, me, me!
Me!
Me!
Me!
Me, me!
Please, me?
How about you?
The tall, handsome one.
Yeah.
Choose your opponent.
Let me see.
I guess I'll pick Teetsi?
Teetsi?
Why did he pick Teetsi?
That's my boy!
He's got some gumption there!
Somebody, wake him up!
All right, so, Teetsi, come on.
Let's do this, huh?
Come on, little tsetse fly.
Let's see your stuff.
Bring it.
- Let's dance!
- OK.
But let me warn you that I am a protégé of Fosse and Robbins!
Not "dance" dance!
Fight!
Dance fight!
You got it.
- Is he dancing?
- What's he doing?
I know that boy is not dancing.
This is even better than I thought.
Alakay, turn around!
No, Pop, it's hop, shuffle, ball change, hip swish, turn around.
Oh, no.
Alakay!
Are you hurt?
Yeah, I am.
Did I... did I win?
No, son.
How could this happen?
You told us you were a king.
A king does not get beat.
I am a king.
I'm the King of New York.
It's my stage name.
Like for when I perform.
Perform?
Oh, no, this is horrible!
Alakay has failed the test!
Who would have ever imagined that today Zuba would have to banish his own son?
Zuba, no.
Zuba, yes.
Sadly, the alpha lion must cast out all failures.
Then I'm no longer the alpha lion.
Dad, what are you doing?
Dad, no!
You can't do this.
Who could possibly take Zuba's place?
Anyone?
Someone?
No one?
You, sir!
I guess not.
Well, I... this is all very awkward, but I suppose I could carry this tremendous burden.
Teetsi!
Get the hat.
As your new leader, I hereby banish Alakay!
He shall wear this Hat of Shame and leave the watering hole for a thousand years, or life!
Whichever comes last.
Shoo, shoo!
Get out of here!
You should have told us you weren't a real king, son!
You never told me I'd have to fight anybody!
What did you expect?
!
I don't know!
Maybe a little fatherly advice like, "Hey, son, it's a fight!"
- You're a lion!
- But I never fought another lion!
No, I guess not.
You dance!
And other stuff!
Your pal, Makunga, set me up back there!
- None of this would have happened...
- If you were a real lion.
- Zuba!
- Yeah, I said it!
A real lion.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Saw.
Suture.
Swab.
You're in my light, Stephen.
You have a brown spot on your shoulder.
That's very observant, Stephen.
As you can see, I'm covered in brown spots.
OK!
That bone will be good as new in a few weeks.
So I don't have to pick out a dying hole?
No, you got your whole life ahead of you.
- Really?
- Go out and grab it by the horns.
- Thank you, Dr. Mankiewicz!
- Break a leg!
Sweet kid.
This spot looks like Witch Doctor's Disease.
Witch Doctor's Disease?
That's the most ridiculous disease I've ever heard of.
- Don't ask.
- Someone's been knotty.
This won't hurt a bit.
Joe, our last witch doctor, had a spot just like that.
- And?
- Monday, Joe.
Wednesday, no Joe.
Wednesday, no Joe?
I can breathe!
Thanks, doc!
So this Witch Doctor's Disease is a real thing?
You'll find a cure.
You've got at least 48 hours!
But I've never heard of it.
I mean...
I don't have any penicillin.
I'll need a CAT scan just to get started!
Have a lion look you over.
They'd be happy to.
Ta-da!
- He has talent.
- Stupendous and tremendous.
Hollah!
Bet you've never seen that one!
Knocked 'em dead in New York!
- Let's all give it a try!
- Let's do it!
Well, you can try all you want to, but it takes years of practice.
You'll never get a tight stream until you build up your lip muscles to the point where you can purse your lips like this.
You got it?
Ta-da!
How did you?
You guys got it right out of the box!
- If you can do it...
...we can do it.
It's in our blood!
I always thought I was a bit unique.
We are unique!
We are like a force of nature!
- A million points of light!
- And dark stripes!
Exactly the same!
Exactly the same.
Looks impressive, Kowalski, but will it fly?
Yes.
If we fold it here, here and here.
Nice.
Oh, man.
My dad thinks I'm a total loser.
I've ruined my parents' lives.
That is definitely not crack-a-lackin'.
It is lacking' in the cracking', my friend.
I've gotta fix this.
So there's...
There's something I gotta tell you.
Hey, guys.
Is this place great or what?
!
I'd go with "or what."
Well, I'll tell you what.
You're not gonna believe it, but I got a date with Moto Moto.
Who's Moto Moto?
Oh, he's so big and handsome and big!
- Know what "Moto Moto" means?
- Twins?
It means, "Hot Hot."
"Hot Hot"?
When did you start parlez-ing African?
It's in my blood.
Don't worry, you can flirt around with Mr. Hot Pants after I'm gone.
Melman, why am I the parade and you're the rain?
Why are you driving your parade under my rain?
Maybe I'll parade in another part of town!
Whoa, guys.
Main Street's mine!
Well, you can have it!
And you can take your hotee-tot float and Mr. Hotee Moto Moto...
- What are you talking about?
- What are we talking about?
Melman, just tell her.
What?
What are you...
I don't know what you're talking about.
I guess I'll go, then.
Don't bother.
- Don't get up on my account.
- Melman!
Gloria!
- I thought you guys were friends!
- Marty's absolutely right.
- Marty?
- Marty?
Marty?
What the heck is going on?
You're not?
Oh!
He was...
I thought he...
You're not him.
He's...
Oh.
You thought that guy was me?
No.
I mean, yes, you...
Guys, come on.
You thought I was him?
You guys kind of do look a little...
You look a lot alike.
Marty, you look a lot alike.
You laugh alike.
Talk alike.
He has the same speech pattern.
It's a little weird, really.
I mean, come on.
Marty.
So you're saying there's nothing unique about me.
I'm just like any other zebra.
No.
Of course you're different!
How?
OK, I can't tell you apart.
Maybe you could wear a bell or something.
- A bell?
!
- OK, not a bell.
Bell's a bad idea.
How about a T-shirt that says, "I'm with stupid"?
- I'm not stupid!
- Not you, stupid!
Him, stupid!
You know, while you've been doing the prancing pony with your new posse,
I've been having the worst day of my life.
It's always about you, isn't it?
My problems are just a little bit bigger than yours.
I couldn't tell you apart.
So what?
!
Yeah, fine.
Run away, Marty!
Run away!
That's what you do best!
Just like back in New York!
I'm right here.
But you can't tell that, right?
Your one-of-a-million friend hopes you enjoy your bigger-than-anyone-else's problems alone!
Good, leave!
I don't need you to help me solve my problems!
You're a dime a dozen!
I can't tell which one's Marty!
Which one's Marty?
Wait a minute.
Oh, yeah, I don't care!
Nice hat, you showoff!
Marty don't go.
Giddy-up, giddy-up!
Giddy-up, giddy-up!
Look, Maurice!
The perfect spot for my summer palace!
Please fill in all these holes and relocate the riff-raff.
- Who'd leave a perfectly good head?
- What a waste.
Tell me about it.
I'm in my prime here.
I'm terminal, you know?
I probably only have another two days left to live.
That's a bummer, man.
If I, King Julien... that's my name only had two days left to live,
I would do all the things
- I've ever dreamed of doing.
- Like what?
I'd love to become a professional whistler.
I'm pretty amazing at it now, but I want to get even better, make my living out of it.
You know what else I would do?
I would invade a neighboring country and impose my own ideology, even if they didn't want it!
Easy for you to say.
You're a king.
Yes.
And you are only just a sad little head.
There must be something you want to do before you die!
- There is this one thing.
- What?
Tell me.
- No, I couldn't.
- What is it?
I never told Gloria how I feel about her.
What is it?
Please tell me!
I never had the guts to tell Gloria how I feel about her.
How I've always felt about her.
Fine.
Don't tell me!
Is it a woman?
You didn't tell me it's a woman.
What are you afraid of?
You're a dead man anyway.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're right.
You've got to march right up to this woman.
Look her right in the eye.
Lean forward.
Just a little, or almost all the way.
Then you let her lean forward a little until you're just lips' distance away from each other.
Then you tell her how much you hate her.
Actually, it's more like love her.
Oh, you sly dog!
Woof, woof!
You're a real player.
Now listen to me.
You got to rise up.
You hearing me?
- He didn't hear you.
- I can't hear you!
- You got to rise up!
- Rising up!
- Get out of the hole!
- I'm rising out of the ground!
- He's rising, Maurice.
- I'm rising, Maurice!
- Rising!
- You go right up to this woman!
Do you feel it?
- Go up to her face!
- Tell the truth!
- I'm going to tell her!
- Then you say, "Baby, I dig you!"
Yeah!
I'm going to do it!
I'm going to do it!
I love that happy little head.
She love
Moto Moto
She love
Moto Moto
She loves me She loves my eyes
She loves me She loves my thighs
She loves my roundness
She love that I'm chunky She love that I'm plumpy
She love my heftiness She love my zestiness
She love me restlessly She love me forever
She love me 'cause she love me
Moto Moto before things get too serious, well,
I was wondering, if I were to, for example, stay here I'd like to ask you...
Let your candied lips be the messengers to my... ear canal.
I have so many questions.
I promise the answer will always be yes.
Unless no is required.
So what is it about me that you find so interesting?
You're the most plumpenest girl I've ever met.
OK.
Other than that.
Let's see.
Yeah, well, you know... you chunky.
Right.
My gosh, girl, you huge.
You said that.
Yeah, that's right.
We don't have to talk no more.
Gloria!
Gloria.
Melman.
Melman, I want you to meet Moto Moto.
Moto Moto.
Yeah, nice to meet you.
- I guess I...
- It's OK, Melman.
Apology accepted.
Oh.
Yeah, right, that.
That's why I...
Good.
OK.
Well, that's it, then.
Good.
We're kind of busy here, man.
No.
No, that's not it.
Listen, Mototo, you better treat this lady like a queen.
Because you, my friend, you found yourself the perfect woman.
If I was ever so lucky to find the perfect woman,
I'd give her flowers every day.
And not just any flowers.
OK?
Her favorites are orchids.
White.
And breakfast in bed.
Six loaves of wheat toast, butter on both sides.
No crust, the way she likes it.
I'd be her shoulder to cry on and her best friend.
I'd spend every day thinking of how to make her laugh.
She has the most amazing laugh.
That's what I would do if I were you.
But I'm not, so you do it.
OK.
What?
That was beautiful.
Anyways, where were we?
I'm "huge"?
Surprised to see me, Makunga?
Well, I'm here to set things straight, like a real lion!
Is this real enough for you?
How about this?
This is for setting me up!
This is for stealing my dad's job!
This is for humiliating my family!
And making me look like a fool!
Had enough?
Sure, fly away!
Coward.
The water.
It's gone.
It's never gone dry before.
- We'll need a lot more dying holes.
- How could this happen?
Out of my way!
What is going on here?
!
The watering hole is dry!
There's barely water for one of us!
- Good observation, Shirley.
- I'm Bobby.
Makunga, what do we do?
Quiet!
Listen up!
I'm afraid there is only one solution to this horrible crisis:
We'll all have to fight for it.
- We can't fight for it.
- That's crazy.
That's not fair.
You'd win!
Exactly, Shirley.
I'm Bob...
Sorry, folks, but life isn't fair.
I'm in charge now, thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion.
Please, Makunga, this is the only water on the reserve.
If you're thirsty, you'll have to look for water off the reserve.
- Off the reserve?
- It's too dangerous!
Hunters would shoot us!
No one leaves the reserve and survives!
I left the reserve!
And survived.
I can do something about this.
Looks like a clogged pipe, like we get in New York.
I'll travel upriver...
- Upriver?
- Off the reserve?
You?
Yeah.
I'll unclog the pipe and bring back your water.
Great!
I'd help you pack, but by the looks of that hat, I see you're all set!
Fine.
Go ahead, laugh.
Laugh your mane off.
I'll prove you wrong.
Maybe you should try a little rain dance.
Zuba would know what to do.
- Where's Zuba?
- You don't care about us.
Zuba should be in charge, not you.
All right, fine!
As an added measure, I will consult with Zuba!
Marty?
Hey!
Marty!
Marty?
Marty.
Where'd you get the fruity hat?
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
Hi.
Is Marty in there?
Anyone seen Marty?
Which one of us is Marty?
All right.
Well, if you see him, tell him his friend Alex came to say goodbye.
Goodbye?
Don't go.
Where are you going?
- Can we come?
- No.
I have to do this alone.
You can't leave the reserve!
What are you doing?
- They'll get your hat.
- Hunters are everywhere!
Could you leave the hat?
Marty!
I know you're in there.
Before I go, I got something I want to say.
You've been a great friend.
You've helped me so often to see the bright side of my problems that I never think of you having any.
I wasn't there for you when you needed me.
Just like back at the zoo.
What kind of friend does that make me?
A pretty lousy friend, I guess.
I just want you to know that I...
You're one in a million.
This is touching.
It is touching.
So could you turn around so I can tell you to your face?
That's right.
Gotcha!
I see you in there!
Yeah, you.
You, right there.
Twelfth row, two hundred and third from the left.
That's you, Marty.
I know it's you.
Know what makes you special?
These guys are white with black stripes.
You're black with white stripes.
You're a dreamer, Marty.
Always have been.
You have great taste in music and horrible taste in friends.
Well, not Melman and Gloria, but me.
OK, I'm in.
Marty, you can't come with me.
You don't have a choice.
- People are out there!
- You're crazy!
Come back!
The people will get you!
Don't lose the hat!
Bye, hat!
Any water?
No, just more diamonds and gold.
Don't give up hope.
Listen up!
I will help you!
There's only one way to get your precious water.
I, your beloved King Julien must simply make a small sacrifice to my good friends, the water gods, in the volcano!
What does that do?
What does that do?
Excellent question.
My sacrifice goes in the volcano.
The friendly gods eat up my sacrifice.
"Thank you for the sacrifice."
"Here, have another." "No, I've had enough."
"I'll be insulted unless you have another."
"I don't want another sacrifice!"
"Look at you!
You're skinny!" "No!
I've had enough!"
The gods eat the sacrifice.
They are grateful.
They give me some water, and then I give it to you.
What?
Does it work?
No!
I mean, yes.
Well, Maurice?
Ah, it's fifty-fifty.
We'll do it!
Excellent!
Now all I need is someone who would like to go into the volcano and get eaten by gods.
Any hands!
Hands, anybody!
I need someone, perhaps who has never found love, who could look death straight in the eyeball.
A real, genuine hero.
- I'll do it.
- Melman?
Hurry up!
Before we all come to our senses!
Melman, what is wrong with you?
I'm dying anyway.
If there's a chance it'll get you water, it's worth it.
Are you nuts?
I want you to know, back at the zoo, it was never the doctors or prescriptions that kept me going.
It was always you.
Seeing you every day.
That's what kept me going.
Melman!
Wait!
Melman!
Melman!
Melman!
You going to mope like this all day?
Don't "hmph" me.
Listen, Zuba.
A miracle happened.
Our son came back to us.
How come that is not good enough for you?
What are you saying, woman?
We lost him once, Zuba.
Let's not lose him again.
Zuba!
- Zuba!
- Get out of here!
What do you want?
It's awful.
The watering hole is dried up.
Dried up?
That's impossible!
There's nothing left!
You're alpha lion, Makunga.
What are you gonna do about it?
Your son, Alakay, he said he could fix it.
He's gone upriver.
- Off the reserve?
!
- No!
I tried to stop him.
I told him it was suicide.
He was determined to prove himself to you.
You stay here, in case he comes back!
Hurry, Zuba!
I'm so parched.
Is this place starting to freak you out?
We'll slip in, find the problem.
Hunters will never know we were here.
Why are we doing this?
Maybe my dad will think I'm...
I want to show him I'm a real lion.
As opposed to a chocolate lion.
I know this may sound hard to believe, but apparently, lions don't dance.
What?
!
As far as my dad is concerned.
As far as people are concerned, you're a hit.
In New York.
This is Africa...
much tougher crowd.
Marty, this is it!
This is the clog!
Come on.
Well, there's the water.
Stay down.
Look at that.
Knit one, purl two.
It's her.
- Is this right?
- Very good.
Nana, slow down.
You're a little tangled, aren't you?
No, don't pull.
I'll do it.
We need dynamite.
Got any?
Oh, snap!
I just used my last stick this morning!
- Savages!
- Evasive maneuvers!
- Serpentine, serpentine!
- Squiggly squid maneuver!
Zag, zig-zag, zig ziggy zag!
No, no!
Squiggly squid!
Etch A Sketch!
That's too complex!
Octopus, octopus!
- Run, Marty!
- I can't leave you here!
Go get help!
Squiggly squid maneuver!
Go!
Go!
Squiggly squid!
Etch A Sketch!
Etch A Sketch!
Save us We love you
OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- Save us
- Melman
- We love you
- Melman
Save us
OK, here we go.
OK, OK.
- Melman
- We love you
- Melman
- Save us
Here we go!
Here we go!
- What's all the hoopla about?
- Joe?
Joe the Witch Doctor?
We thought you were dead!
So did I. Then I realized I'm covered in brown spots.
So Melman's not dying!
- Melman's not dying!
- Oh, no!
Melman!
Move!
Don't do this!
Julien, stop this!
This is crazy!
Oh, suddenly throwing a giraffe into a volcano to make water is crazy!
Yes!
- Please, Melman!
Stop!
- Gloria?
- You can't do this!
- Why not?
Because...
You can't do this, Melman.
First, that hurts.
Second, I've only got 18 hours to live, anyway.
Melman, I gotta know did you mean those things you said about me?
Of course I did.
- That's crazy.
- It is?
It's crazy to think I had to go halfway around the world to find out the perfect guy for me lived right next door.
Then it's you and me, neighbor.
You and me for the next 18 hours.
I'll take whatever you got.
- Maurice, what happened?
- I believe the fat lady has sung.
- What's going on here?
- Marty!
Alex is in big trouble!
We got to get upriver fast!
- What about the plane?
- Perfect!
Come on!
The plane won't be fixed until the suits meet our demands.
Now, maternity leave.
Maternity leave?
You're all males.
We need that plane for a rescue mission.
There's nothing I can do until we bust up this union.
I'll bust up all of you if you don't get this plane going.
Can't you see these commies have my hands tied?
No maternity leave.
Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want these blowing around on the savanna.
All right.
You get your maternity leave.
Finally.
Where we headed?
What's going on?
Where are we going?
Oh, no!
Please!
Don't put me there!
No!
This is wrong.
You see?
You are survivors.
Now, how about a nice lion casserole?
You can't eat a lion.
Don't worry, it tastes like chicken.
No, no, no.
Don't listen to her.
She's out of her mind, people!
I'm from New York City!
It's me, Alex the lion!
From Central Park!
Dad!
What were you thinking, son?
You got no business being out here!
Stay behind me.
They're New Yorkers.
They're just rude and frightened people.
Stay back!
You'd let your dinner get away?
- What are you doing?
- The only thing I know how to do.
What the heck?
Hey, I know those moves.
Alex?
- It's Alex the lion!
- From Central Park!
It is Alex!
Only one lion can move like that!
He's beautiful.
I can't believe it.
How does he do that?
What are you doing?
I'm dancing with my son!
I think.
Don't think, Dad.
Feel!
Butterfly!
I'm feeling it!
I'm feeling it!
Roar!
That was beautiful.
Now let's eat!
Dad, look out!
What the...
Alex!
Get in!
She's got a gun!
Get out while we can!
- What?
- She's got a gun!
Get out while we can!
Pass it on!
He said let's have some fun and take out the dam.
Basset hound.
Skipper!
Alex wants to take out the dam.
All right!
But it's his funeral.
- Hard to port!
- Aye-aye, Skippy!
Bring it on!
Bring it on!
Come back!
That's my dinner!
Kowalski, full throttle.
Music!
- I like this song.
- It never gets old.
It does have a catchy hook.
Come about!
Bring her in low!
Hold onto your skirts!
It's dam-busting time!
Hold on tight, baby!
Here we go!
Tell them no!
Pull up!
They'll kill us!
There's got to be another way!
Pass it on!
They say no pull up.
Kill us.
There's no other way.
Basset hound.
Are you sure?
Men, there is no sacrifice greater than someone else's.
No!
Medic!
Ramming speed!
Bring it on!
Bad kitties.
I don't know why the sacrifice didn't work.
The science seemed so solid.
I'd jump right in that volcano if I wasn't so good at whistling.
It's you!
I found you!
Mort?
Bad fishy!
I wonder if the gods like seafood.
Let's find out.
Look, Maurice.
- That was quick.
- I did it!
I did it!
I did it!
OK, you did it!
Oh, yes!
Look!
- It's Alakay!
- It's Zuba!
You did it!
Alakay, Zuba, you did it!
Zuba!
Alakay!
You're back!
I'm so glad you're safe!
Out of my way.
Well, well, well.
You know, Zuba, if I remember correctly, you quit the pride.
And you were kicked out.
So don't think that this changes anything.
You're right.
In fact, we humbly present you with this token of appreciation.
A man bag.
Very popular where I'm from.
- Don't know what to say.
- Still be tough and carry your stuff.
Does the strap adjust?
This will go very nicely for me when I go out hiking.
But you're still banished.
We figured you'd say that.
My handbag!
You bad kitty!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
You deserve this, son.
Welcome to the pride.
Thanks, Dad.
But this belongs to you.
No, son.
To us!
My son!
The King of New York!
That's my baby!
Love transcends all differences.
We are gathered here today to celebrate such a love.
Do you take each other, for better or for worse?
For better, please.
What a beautiful, weird couple!
That's not going to last.
Can I kiss the bride?
No!
Music!
- Struts.
- Check.
- Flaps!
- Check.
- Diamonds and gold.
- Check.
- Bye-bye!
- We'll miss you!
See you later!
We'll be back after the honeymoon in Monte Carlo, or whenever the gold runs out.
Come back soon!
Mom, let them take their time.
New York isn't going anywhere, right, guys?
You're right about that!
As long as I'm with her and you two, I don't care where we are.
She has the most amazing laugh.
Love has no boundaries!
Looks like you're stuck with us for a while.
Dad?
What's wrong?
I just thought we could hang out a bit and...
- You got me!
- I got you, son!
You got me with my thing.
You brought it back around on me.
I got you, son!
The old man's not too bad, eh, Marty?
- Marty?
Who's Marty?
- Come on.
- I don't know no Marty.
- You can't fool me.
Ain't no Marty here.
Marty!
I can look into your eyes, and I know it's you.
See, I've been traveling Been traveling forever
But now that I found a home feels like I'm in heaven
See, I've been traveling Been traveling forever
But now that I'm home
Hey!
Shake the hot things!
Shake the hot things!
Shake 'em!
Shake 'em!
Shake 'em!
Subtitles by LeapinLar
Well done, boys.
Looks like ice-cold sushi for breakfast.
No, no, son.
Over here.
See the lion?
Look at the lion and get the lion.
Now, son, if you're gonna grow up and be like your daddy someday, you gotta learn how to fight.
Da-da.
Now, Alakay, let me show you something, OK?
You see this mark?
You and me are the same.
When you're bigger, you'll be Alpha Lion, just like me.
Now let me see you fight.
Ready?
No, Alakay.
No dancing!
You just amuse yourself, don't you?
You're a strange kid.
You're a strange one.
I'm...
Now, come on, let's try it again.
No, Alakay.
Stop that right now.
Doggone it!
It's so disappointing when they don't grow up the way you want.
Makunga.
You're not challenging me again, are you?
Look on the bright side.
After I defeat you and become alpha lion, you'll have more time to spend with your pathetic son.
Before I kick your butt, let me ask you:
Why do you want to become the alpha lion?
I'm better looking, I have better hair, I'm deceivingly smart and I want everyone else to do what I say.
We fight on three.
One...
Pay attention, Alakay.
Daddy will show you how it's done.
Two, three!
- Who's the alpha lion?
- You are.
Don't you forget it.
And that, Alakay, is how you attack...
Alakay?
That's it.
Here, kitty, kitty.
This one's a beauty.
He'll be worth a few bucks.
It just gets easier and easier.
Daddy!
Alakay!
Alakay!
Alakay!
Da-da!
No!
No!
No!
Alakay!
- Daddy!
- Daddy's got you!
Hold on!
Da-da!
Alakay!
Daddy!
I've been around the world in the pouring rain
Feeling out of place and feeling strange
Take me to a place where they know my name
'Cause I ain't met nobody that looks the same
I'm a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle
He's a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle
I'm a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle
He's a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle
I need my peoples, my peoples Take me to my peoples
Play that jungle fever Show 'em some love
Show love
Just gotta have someone Gotta have someone
To relate to, to relate to
I'm feeling right at home
Feeling right at home Feeling right at home
Feeling right at home I'm feeling right at home
See I been traveling Been traveling forever...
- I don't like the looks of this guy.
- He's kind of cute.
He's kind of a showoff.
You think he's cute?
Roar!
The King of New York City Alex the Lion!
I still think he's kind of a showoff.
The guy's an animal.
Maybe he should take a break.
You know, we could all use a vacation.
Come on, where would we go on vacation?
I don't know about you, but I want to go to Connecticut!
On the loose, several animals, including the world famous Alex the Lion, escaped from the Central Park Zoo tonight.
The escapees were cornered in Grand Central Station.
He was a very bad kitty.
Animal rights activists, who convinced zoo officials to have the animals sent to Africa, were stunned to learn that the freighter carrying the animals was reported missing today.
Tonight, hundreds of New Yorkers have gathered at the zoo to mourn the loss of their beloved zoo animals.
The question on everyone's mind, where are they now?
I like to move it, move it
He likes to move it, move it
She likes to move it, move it
- We like to
- Move it!
Come on!
Y'all know this one!
It never gets stale!
- We like to
- Move it!
We'll miss you little fuzz buckets!
You've been a great crowd!
Glad we could introduce you to the toilet.
If you ever come look us up in Manhattan, feel free to call first.
Seriously though, call.
OK?
Settle down, everybody.
Be quiet!
You can't leave without this!
Surprise, freaks!
Shake it!
Shake it.
Look, I'm a lady!
I'm a lady, everyone!
I'm a lady!
Not really!
It's me, King Julien!
Which of you is attracted to me?
Hands up!
Hey, freaks!
You will be very glad to hear that I am coming with you.
Oh, no, thank you.
Yes, thank you.
It's my plane!
Until I return with the spoils from the new country Stevie will be in charge!
I don't think they like that idea.
What are you saying, Stevie?
No.
Could we...?
No, you didn't say that!
How is that even possible?
Naughty little thing!
Stevie says...
Let them eat cake!
King Julien, wait for me!
I'm all packed!
I have a whole itinerary planned!
Oh, no!
It's Mort!
He's so annoying!
Don't let him on.
Stop that thing!
He's carrying scissors and hand cream!
Everybody in!
Quickly, get in, get in!
Get in quick!
- Struts.
- Check.
- Flaps.
- Check.
- Engine.
Coffee maker.
- Check.
You guys!
Oopsie-daisy!
That has to be the second biggest slingshot I've ever seen.
But it'll have to do.
Attention.
This is your captain speaking.
In the event of an emergency, place the vest over your head then kiss your... good-bye.
New York City, here we come!
Pray to your personal God this hunk of junk flies.
Personal God, hunk...?
What?
We are go, sir.
Open the door!
I'm outside!
If cabin pressure is lost, place the mask over your face to hide your terrified expression.
Miss, aren't these supposed to be attached to my seat?
- No, sir.
- OK, boys, launch!
Launch!
- Launch!
- Launch!
Gremlin!
Hey, Mort.
Hi!
That was weird.
- Somebody's dreaming.
- I think I saw Mort on the plane wing.
You got Madagascar on the brain.
I know I'm gonna miss it.
It was incredible.
I think it'll seem more fun the further we are from it.
Like when you bit me on the butt?
I'm gonna take that thing you're holding onto and use it onstage.
It's all part of my little actor's salad bar of emotional tidbits.
Are the butts next to the croutons?
You don't need to be sarcastic.
When we get back, I might sign up for the breeding program.
Breeding program?
We reach a point when we want to meet somebody.
Settle down, have a relationship.
I can see that.
What?
Like dating?
Yeah, dating.
Other... other guys?
What do you mean, other guys?
Darn it!
What is holding up that beverage service?
!
I'm gonna go check.
You all keep talking.
I'm gonna catch a few winks.
It's so funny!
I like laughing!
It's such a nice experience!
To laugh!
Do you mind going back?
This is first class.
It's nothing personal.
We're just better than you.
Maurice, I'm open!
Hit me!
- He shoots, he scores!
- Is that Vivaldi?
- In-flight slave.
- Can I help you, Mr. Mankiewicz?
Bring my nuts on a silver platter.
We were checking on our drink order.
Sorry.
Been a little backed up.
- I guess I'll go back...
- Where's your body?
You're freaking me out!
Can you please go over there, please?
What happened to the separation of the classes?
I'm sure this democracy thing is just a fad.
We'll go out for pineapple, my bobbly-headed boobily-boo.
Skipper, look.
Analysis.
Looks like a small bulb used to indicate something unusual, like a malfunction.
I find it pretty and somewhat hypnotic.
That too, sir.
Right!
Rico?
Manual!
Problemo solved.
- We may be out of fuel.
- Why do you think so?
We've lost engine one and engine two is no longer on fire.
Buckle up, boys.
Don't look, doll.
This might get hairy.
Attention!
This is your captain.
I have good and bad news.
The good news is, we're landing immediately.
The bad news is, we're crash-landing.
When it comes to air travel, we know you have no choice.
But thanks for choosing Air Penguin.
Raise your arms, Maurice!
It's more fun when you raise your arms!
I can fly!
This could be it, Marty!
I want you to know you are a one-in-a-million friend!
Thanks, buddy!
You're the best ever!
- And you won't mind when I tell you...
- Tell me anything!
I broke your iPod!
The buttons were so small!
It made me mad!
- The horror!
- I'm sorry!
- I'll kill you, butt-biter!
- It was an accident!
- An accident!
- Butt-biter!
I love you, Gloria!
I always have!
Like you love the beach.
Or a good book.
Or the beach.
Goodness, doll, you're shaking like a leaf.
Rico, you've had your fun.
Pull up.
Gear down.
Gently.
You just want to kiss the ground.
Just a peck, a smooch, like you'd kiss your sister.
I said, kiss it!
Now just a little brake.
Just a touch.
I believe that's checkmate.
Commence emergency landing procedure.
Flaps up!
Deploy!
Oh, we're here.
What in the world?
What happened to the plane?
What did y'all do to the plane?
I'm OK.
I'm alive.
I can't even sleep for a minute.
This is not JFK.
Kowalski, casualty report.
Two passengers unaccounted for.
That's a number I can live with.
Good landing, boys.
Who says a penguin can't fly?
Hey, happy slappers!
Is there some reason to celebrate?
Look at the plane!
- We'll fix it.
- How are you gonna fix this?
Grit, spit and a whole lot of duct tape.
We should be up and running in, say, six to nine months.
- Sixty-nine months?
!
- No, six to nine months.
Kowalski, I say we use this setback to our advantage.
- Where'd you get that number?
- I want you to reconfigure the design.
How do you estimate that?
Pretty boy!
Why don't you and your friends dig a latrine.
Hold on.
Who made you king of the plane wreck?
Excuse me?
Fine.
You can be in charge.
You fix the plane.
Who gives you the authority to put me in charge?
OK, then I'll remain in charge.
Yeah, you will remain in charge.
You and your hippie friends stay out of our hair.
Correcto-mundo.
Because I decided to.
- Good for you.
- Well, this discussion isn't over.
Higher mammals!
Stay with us.
We could use your front cortexes and opposable thumbs.
Phil!
I should wash your hands out with soap.
How in the hell-o will they fix this plane?
!
You know, grit and spit and spit.
A lot of spit and grit and stick-to-it-iveness.
That don't sound too promising.
You're right.
We're stuck here.
As long as we're together, we'll be OK.
Yeah, but love ain't gonna get us home.
Behold!
The lion!
- People!
- There is much to see.
Moving on.
Wait, wait, wait!
People!
- They'll help us!
- Wait up!
- People!
Stop!
- Help us!
If you stop, I'll autograph those!
I know you!
You.
It's the bad kitty.
How do you like some of that?
!
Come in, Tokyo!
Right in the batteries.
You think an old lady can't take care of herself?
Next time, I won't go so easy on you!
Thank you, dear.
Moving on!
Are you out of your mind?
We need help and you harass old ladies?
!
Out of my mind?
Who's out of my mind now?
- See if you can get an operator.
- No problem.
Out of my mind.
We're going home.
Message E-4.
The service user has roamed outside the coverage area.
Please try again later.
Am I trippin'?
All those zebras...
like me.
- Where are we?
- San Diego.
This time I'm 40 percent sure.
- I know this place.
- I think it's Africa.
Africa?
It's got to be.
Our ancestral crib.
It's in our blood.
I can feel it!
No, it's more than that.
It's like déjà vu, like I've been here before.
It's like Roots!
No, it's like déjà vu, like I've been here before.
How!
How!
Me Alex!
Me and me friends fly, fly in great metal bird.
Then plummet!
Smash ground!
Go boom!
Then here we emerge.
We offer only happiness and good greetings.
Is he dancing about a plane crash?
Yeah.
We just... yeah.
I thought...
Sorry.
You came from off the reserve?
Way off.
From the Central Park Zoo, actually.
Don't strain yourself.
What's going on here?
They say they're from off the reserve.
That's impossible.
Only people come from off the reserve.
You look familiar.
Do I know you?
How could you survive the hunters?
We didn't see any hunters.
- What are you looking at?
- Me?
Nothing.
This watering hole doesn't need any more mouths to feed.
So skedaddle back to where you came from.
Is there a manager we could talk to?
I see.
You're here to challenge me!
What?
No!
No.
That's what it looks like to me!
Zuba!
Wait.
I'm trying to take care of business...
Yeah, yeah, Zuba.
Hold on.
Alakay?
Is that you?
No, it's Alex.
Ix.
Like New York Knicks.
Zuba, look!
I've always had that.
The vet checked it out.
It's kind of a beauty spot, really.
A mark.
All right, this is a little weird.
Honey, he's come home.
What?
You've come home.
Son.
Dad.
Mom and Dad?
Mom and Dad!
Mom and Dad!
It's my mom and dad!
I got a mom and dad!
My baby's alive!
Dad!
My son!
My son is home!
Alakay!
Alakay has come home!
Alakay!
Yeah!
The prodigal son returns.
This is perfect!
I thought you hated Zuba.
No, I do.
I do.
I do.
I hate him.
Oh, I do.
And I'm going to use Alakay, yes.
I'm going to use him to get rid of Zuba once and for all!
Giddy-up, feathered horse!
Make way!
Move out of the way!
Stand aside!
New York!
It's a bit of a dump.
Are you sure we're not in New Jersey?
Hello, New Yorkers!
Your new king is here!
This calls for a celebration!
Maurice, I think they like me.
You've got to love a non-hostile takeover!
Chukka-chukka what?
Excuse me.
I'm Marty.
I'm kind of new around here.
Hey, Marty!
You're a good-looking group!
You like to run?
Yeah.
Running is crack-a-lackin'.
That's right!
Crack-a-lackin'.
You guys speak my crack-a-lackin' language.
What?
You don't have doctors here?
Not anymore.
Well, what if you catch a cold?
We go over to the dying holes and we die.
You guys really need a doctor.
- We have an opening.
- Would you be interested?
Me?
A doctor?
It's raining men.
Hallelujah!
You all got it going on.
Why don't you have a man?
You got worms?
Oh, I got rid of those.
Listen, girls.
Manhattan is short on two things, parking and hippos.
Hey, everybody!
I just found out that my son is a doggone king!
The King of New York!
Show me some of your moves, son.
Don't be bashful.
All right.
This one always knocks 'em dead.
Roar!
Look out.
The King is mad.
The King is mad!
Let's welcome him back into the pride with open arms!
Welcome to the herd, Marty!
Me?
I've always wanted to be part of a herd!
- It's one for all...
- And all for all, y'all!
How do I look?
Technically, a traditional witch doctor has a bone through his nose.
Don't worry... it's just a clip-on.
Voilà!
He's a witch doctor!
My mother will be so happy.
Look out!
I think Moto Moto likes you.
Here he comes.
I like 'em big
I like 'em chunky
I like 'em big I like 'em plumpy
I like 'em round With something' somethin'
They like my sound They think I'm funky
Goodness, girl... you huge.
Who's your friend?
Or is that your butt?
You as quick as you are hefty.
So you're Moto Moto?
The name's so nice, you say it twice.
I kind of like it, fatso.
I'll see you around, girl.
It won't be hard, because you so... plumpy.
Oops!
I hate to be a party pooper, Zuba, but some of the lions were wondering when you plan to banish your son.
- What are you talking about?
- It's nothing, really.
They're griping that Alakay never went through the rite of passage, blah, blah, blah, so technically speaking, he can't be a member of the pride.
It's nonsense.
I forgot about the rite of passage.
What is it?
What's this rite of passage?
A traditional coming-of-age ceremony.
Young lions earn their manes by demonstrating their skills.
- A show-of-skill talent show deal?
- Yeah.
Strutting their stuff.
A performance!
I think that's up my alley.
If it's tradition, I want to do it.
Strut my stuff.
Earn my mane.
I want to be Alaki.
- Alakay.
- Alakay!
Even better.
We will hold the rite of passage in the morning!
That's wonderful!
Good luck, Alakay.
Where I'm from, we say, "Break a leg."
That's my boy!
I'm a private dancer
A dancer for money
Any old music will do
Beautiful, isn't it?
It's amazing.
Guys this is where we belong.
Operation Tourist Trap is a go.
Oh, I like that one.
It works on many levels.
You guys are a bunch of suck-ups.
- That, too.
- Absolutely.
Stations.
Stage one.
Go!
Oh, no!
What have I done?
Come on, take the bait.
- What happened?
- Oh, look at the poor little guy.
Is it dead?
Stage two!
Go, go, go!
I will give him the kiss of life.
Rico!
Rico!
Reverse!
Gas!
Music!
No!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Come back!
What is all this rock'n'roll racket?
!
Is she dead?
No!
You hoodlums!
Good heavens!
Are you OK?
Lady, I found your pocketbook.
My handbag.
Such a good boy.
Nana can't survive without it.
You are one tough cookie.
Brownies Troop 416, Yonkers.
OK, nobody panic!
The best thing we can do is stay together.
We'll wait for another tour jeep.
It may take hours, but...
Where are you going?
I'm not staying here to be attacked by more animals!
I'm too old to die.
I'm going with her.
Old lady, wait up!
Please!
We need to stay together.
Fine!
We'll go that way!
Does anyone want a hard candy?
- Easy now.
- Watch your step.
And right here...
OK, are you ready?
This is where you always slept.
Oh, man!
- Was this mine?
- Look at you.
Look at him.
Oh, this thing.
Look, look!
- I remember this!
- He remembers.
A little harder than...
You never slept on the right end.
You always slept on the bottom end.
Is that...?
Is that my...?
Is that me?
You had the cutest little paws.
Little, little bitty ol' paws.
You did that the day we lost you.
Wow.
I was so young.
What happened to me?
It was all my fault.
I turned my back and...
It was not your fault.
Your father did everything he could.
He tracked those hunters for weeks.
Far off the reserve.
Finally, I had to assume the hunters well...
We thought they'd killed you.
But my son fought them off!
Don't mess with the King of New York!
- That's right!
- Keep your chin in.
You boys be careful!
Watch out before you break something.
You used to call this "foofie."
"Foofie"?
Foofie.
He doesn't want that.
This is my foofie!
Zuba, you better give him his foofie.
I mean, no, thank you, thank you.
It's perfect.
Son, you get your rest.
You have a big day tomorrow.
You'll need all your strength.
I will bring the house down for you.
I hope so.
Otherwise, your father will have to banish you.
Jeez, Mom, really?
I know you'll do us proud.
You know why?
You were born with it.
Good night, Alakay.
My boy.
My own boy.
My son's a king.
My son's a king.
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Alakay.
Foofie.
Look at foofie!
My foofie!
Foofie, foofie, foofie.
My foofie!
No sign of civilization.
Everybody appears very tired.
I think we're lost.
Nana, do you know where you're going?
No, but I'm going with a skip in my step and a smile on my face.
Sure, right, OK.
Yeah, all right.
- It's people.
- How did you get here?
- Can you help us?
We're lost.
- We're lost too.
It was awful.
A flash of black and white and they were gone.
They took the jeep!
- That happened to our jeep too!
- What do we do?
How will we all survive?
No food, no water, no shelter.
What are we gonna do?
!
You can let nature get the best of you, or you can get the best of nature.
Gather 'round, children.
We're New Yorkers, right?
Yeah.
We survive the concrete jungle!
When we need food, we hunt for a decent hot dog stand.
- Am I right?
- She's right.
When we need shelter, we build skyscrapers.
- Exactly!
- When we need water, we build a dam.
We're New Yorkers, for crying out loud!
If we can make it there, we can make it anywhere!
I'm coming, King Julien!
Bad fishy!
Bad fishy!
No, shark, no!
Sit!
Why am I laughing?
We have all the parts we need, but we're slightly behind schedule.
- How slightly?
- Six to nine years.
- Sixty-nine years?
- No, six to nine years.
Private!
What happened to our thumbs?
Haven't seen them since yesterday.
Darn you, Darwin!
Nobody goes AWOL on my watch.
Private!
You're coming with me.
Rico!
You're coming with me!
- We'll bring them in for court martial.
- That won't be necessary!
We've recruited a few extra thumbs for you, Skipper.
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.
Oh, I doubt that.
Enough lollygagging.
Let's get to work.
There'll be three groups.
Group Alpha will do sheet metal fabrication.
Group Bronson handles assembly.
Group George Peppard, craft services.
Any questions?
Good!
Let's get to work.
I'd like to kiss you, monkey man.
All right, but you're so darn ugly.
Remember, little cub scouts, a great dance performance comes from the heart.
Straight from the heart, you'll never go wrong.
Sure, mister.
Hey, Alakay, I just happened to walk by, I thought I'd wish you luck.
- You're not nervous, are you?
- Nah, it's my thing.
In my opinion, the key to this is choosing the right competitor.
You mean, this is like a dance battle sort of thing?
- Like a dance-off?
- Sure.
Great.
I love that.
Freestyle.
Who'd be a good match for me?
Just to keep things interesting.
Well, I wish I could help, but that's strictly against our ancient tradition and all we hold sacred.
But if it was me out there...
I'd choose Teetsi.
Teetsi.
OK.
Sounds interesting.
Makunga, right?
Thank you.
Anything for Zuba's boy.
Go get 'em, tiger.
Shake it out.
A five, six, seven, eight.
Let's go, let's do this.
Let us begin the rite of passage ceremony.
- Come on, baby!
Make Mama proud!
- Woman, I'm trying to take...
On it, Mom!
Who will be the first participant?
Me!
Oh!
Me, me, me!
Me!
Me!
Me!
Me, me!
Please, me?
How about you?
The tall, handsome one.
Yeah.
Choose your opponent.
Let me see.
I guess I'll pick Teetsi?
Teetsi?
Why did he pick Teetsi?
That's my boy!
He's got some gumption there!
Somebody, wake him up!
All right, so, Teetsi, come on.
Let's do this, huh?
Come on, little tsetse fly.
Let's see your stuff.
Bring it.
- Let's dance!
- OK.
But let me warn you that I am a protégé of Fosse and Robbins!
Not "dance" dance!
Fight!
Dance fight!
You got it.
- Is he dancing?
- What's he doing?
I know that boy is not dancing.
This is even better than I thought.
Alakay, turn around!
No, Pop, it's hop, shuffle, ball change, hip swish, turn around.
Oh, no.
Alakay!
Are you hurt?
Yeah, I am.
Did I... did I win?
No, son.
How could this happen?
You told us you were a king.
A king does not get beat.
I am a king.
I'm the King of New York.
It's my stage name.
Like for when I perform.
Perform?
Oh, no, this is horrible!
Alakay has failed the test!
Who would have ever imagined that today Zuba would have to banish his own son?
Zuba, no.
Zuba, yes.
Sadly, the alpha lion must cast out all failures.
Then I'm no longer the alpha lion.
Dad, what are you doing?
Dad, no!
You can't do this.
Who could possibly take Zuba's place?
Anyone?
Someone?
No one?
You, sir!
I guess not.
Well, I... this is all very awkward, but I suppose I could carry this tremendous burden.
Teetsi!
Get the hat.
As your new leader, I hereby banish Alakay!
He shall wear this Hat of Shame and leave the watering hole for a thousand years, or life!
Whichever comes last.
Shoo, shoo!
Get out of here!
You should have told us you weren't a real king, son!
You never told me I'd have to fight anybody!
What did you expect?
!
I don't know!
Maybe a little fatherly advice like, "Hey, son, it's a fight!"
- You're a lion!
- But I never fought another lion!
No, I guess not.
You dance!
And other stuff!
Your pal, Makunga, set me up back there!
- None of this would have happened...
- If you were a real lion.
- Zuba!
- Yeah, I said it!
A real lion.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Saw.
Suture.
Swab.
You're in my light, Stephen.
You have a brown spot on your shoulder.
That's very observant, Stephen.
As you can see, I'm covered in brown spots.
OK!
That bone will be good as new in a few weeks.
So I don't have to pick out a dying hole?
No, you got your whole life ahead of you.
- Really?
- Go out and grab it by the horns.
- Thank you, Dr. Mankiewicz!
- Break a leg!
Sweet kid.
This spot looks like Witch Doctor's Disease.
Witch Doctor's Disease?
That's the most ridiculous disease I've ever heard of.
- Don't ask.
- Someone's been knotty.
This won't hurt a bit.
Joe, our last witch doctor, had a spot just like that.
- And?
- Monday, Joe.
Wednesday, no Joe.
Wednesday, no Joe?
I can breathe!
Thanks, doc!
So this Witch Doctor's Disease is a real thing?
You'll find a cure.
You've got at least 48 hours!
But I've never heard of it.
I mean...
I don't have any penicillin.
I'll need a CAT scan just to get started!
Have a lion look you over.
They'd be happy to.
Ta-da!
- He has talent.
- Stupendous and tremendous.
Hollah!
Bet you've never seen that one!
Knocked 'em dead in New York!
- Let's all give it a try!
- Let's do it!
Well, you can try all you want to, but it takes years of practice.
You'll never get a tight stream until you build up your lip muscles to the point where you can purse your lips like this.
You got it?
Ta-da!
How did you...?
You guys got it right out of the box!
- If you can do it...
- ...we can do it.
It's in our blood!
I always thought I was a bit unique.
We are unique!
We are like a force of nature!
- A million points of light!
- And dark stripes!
Exactly the same!
Exactly the same.
Looks impressive, Kowalski, but will it fly?
Yes.
If we fold it here, here and here.
Nice.
Oh, man.
My dad thinks I'm a total loser.
I've ruined my parents' lives.
That is definitely not crack-a-lackin'.
It is lacking' in the cracking', my friend.
I've gotta fix this.
So there's...
There's something I gotta tell you.
Hey, guys.
Is this place great or what?
!
I'd go with "or what."
Well, I'll tell you what.
You're not gonna believe it, but I got a date with Moto Moto.
Who's Moto Moto?
Oh, he's so big and handsome and big!
- Know what "Moto Moto" means?
- Twins?
It means, "Hot Hot."
"Hot Hot"?
When did you start parlez-ing African?
It's in my blood.
Don't worry, you can flirt around with Mr. Hot Pants after I'm gone.
Melman, why am I the parade and you're the rain?
Why are you driving your parade under my rain?
Maybe I'll parade in another part of town!
Whoa, guys.
Main Street's mine!
Well, you can have it!
And you can take your hotee-tot float and Mr. Hotee Moto Moto...
- What are you talking about?
- What are we talking about?
Melman, just tell her.
What?
What are you...
I don't know what you're talking about.
I guess I'll go, then.
Don't bother.
- Don't get up on my account.
- Melman!
Gloria!
- I thought you guys were friends!
- Marty's absolutely right.
- Marty?
- Marty?
Marty?
What the heck is going on?
You're not...?
Oh!
He was...
I thought he...
You're not him.
He's...
Oh.
You thought that guy was me?
No.
I mean, yes, you...
Guys, come on.
You thought I was him?
You guys kind of do look a little...
You look a lot alike.
Marty, you look a lot alike.
You laugh alike.
Talk alike.
He has the same speech pattern.
It's a little weird, really.
I mean, come on.
Marty.
So you're saying there's nothing unique about me.
I'm just like any other zebra.
No.
Of course you're different!
How?
OK, I can't tell you apart.
Maybe you could wear a bell or something.
- A bell?
!
- OK, not a bell.
Bell's a bad idea.
How about a T-shirt that says, "I'm with stupid"?
- I'm not stupid!
- Not you, stupid!
Him, stupid!
You know, while you've been doing the prancing pony with your new posse,
I've been having the worst day of my life.
It's always about you, isn't it?
My problems are just a little bit bigger than yours.
I couldn't tell you apart.
So what?
!
Yeah, fine.
Run away, Marty!
Run away!
That's what you do best!
Just like back in New York!
I'm right here.
But you can't tell that, right?
Your one-of-a-million friend hopes you enjoy your bigger-than-anyone-else's problems alone!
Good, leave!
I don't need you to help me solve my problems!
You're a dime a dozen!
I can't tell which one's Marty!
Which one's Marty?
Wait a minute.
Oh, yeah, I don't care!
Nice hat, you showoff!
Marty don't go.
Giddy-up, giddy-up!
Giddy-up, giddy-up!
Look, Maurice!
The perfect spot for my summer palace!
Please fill in all these holes and relocate the riff-raff.
- Who'd leave a perfectly good head?
- What a waste.
Tell me about it.
I'm in my prime here.
I'm terminal, you know?
I probably only have another two days left to live.
That's a bummer, man.
If I, King Julien... that's my name only had two days left to live,
I would do all the things
- I've ever dreamed of doing.
- Like what?
I'd love to become a professional whistler.
I'm pretty amazing at it now, but I want to get even better, make my living out of it.
You know what else I would do?
I would invade a neighboring country and impose my own ideology, even if they didn't want it!
Easy for you to say.
You're a king.
Yes.
And you are only just a sad little head.
There must be something you want to do before you die!
- There is this one thing.
- What?
Tell me.
- No, I couldn't.
- What is it?
I never told Gloria how I feel about her.
What is it?
Please tell me!
I never had the guts to tell Gloria how I feel about her.
How I've always felt about her.
Fine.
Don't tell me!
Is it a woman?
You didn't tell me it's a woman.
What are you afraid of?
You're a dead man anyway.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're right.
You've got to march right up to this woman.
Look her right in the eye.
Lean forward.
Just a little, or almost all the way.
Then you let her lean forward a little until you're just lips' distance away from each other.
Then you tell her how much you hate her.
Actually, it's more like love her.
Oh, you sly dog!
Woof, woof!
You're a real player.
Now listen to me.
You got to rise up.
You hearing me?
- He didn't hear you.
- I can't hear you!
- You got to rise up!
- Rising up!
- Get out of the hole!
- I'm rising out of the ground!
- He's rising, Maurice.
- I'm rising, Maurice!
- Rising!
- You go right up to this woman!
Do you feel it?
- Go up to her face!
- Tell the truth!
- I'm going to tell her!
- Then you say, "Baby, I dig you!"
Yeah!
I'm going to do it!
I'm going to do it!
I love that happy little head.
She love
Moto Moto
She love
Moto Moto
She loves me She loves my eyes
She loves me She loves my thighs
She loves my roundness
She love that I'm chunky She love that I'm plumpy
She love my heftiness She love my zestiness
She love me restlessly She love me forever
She love me 'cause she love me
Moto Moto before things get too serious, well,
I was wondering, if I were to, for example, stay here I'd like to ask you...
Let your candied lips be the messengers to my... ear canal.
I have so many questions.
I promise the answer will always be yes.
Unless no is required.
So what is it about me that you find so interesting?
You're the most plumpenest girl I've ever met.
OK.
Other than that.
Let's see.
Yeah, well, you know... you chunky.
Right.
My gosh, girl, you huge.
You said that.
Yeah, that's right.
We don't have to talk no more.
Gloria!
Gloria.
Melman.
Melman, I want you to meet Moto Moto.
Moto Moto.
Yeah, nice to meet you.
- I guess I...
- It's OK, Melman.
Apology accepted.
Oh.
Yeah, right, that.
That's why I...
Good.
OK.
Well, that's it, then.
Good.
We're kind of busy here, man.
No.
No, that's not it.
Listen, Mototo, you better treat this lady like a queen.
Because you, my friend, you found yourself the perfect woman.
If I was ever so lucky to find the perfect woman,
I'd give her flowers every day.
And not just any flowers.
OK?
Her favorites are orchids.
White.
And breakfast in bed.
Six loaves of wheat toast, butter on both sides.
No crust, the way she likes it.
I'd be her shoulder to cry on and her best friend.
I'd spend every day thinking of how to make her laugh.
She has the most amazing laugh.
That's what I would do if I were you.
But I'm not, so you do it.
OK.
What?
That was beautiful.
Anyways, where were we?
I'm "huge"?
Surprised to see me, Makunga?
Well, I'm here to set things straight, like a real lion!
Is this real enough for you?
How about this?
This is for setting me up!
This is for stealing my dad's job!
This is for humiliating my family!
And making me look like a fool!
Had enough?
Sure, fly away!
Coward.
The water.
It's gone.
It's never gone dry before.
- We'll need a lot more dying holes.
- How could this happen?
Out of my way!
What is going on here?
!
The watering hole is dry!
There's barely water for one of us!
- Good observation, Shirley.
- I'm Bobby.
Makunga, what do we do?
Quiet!
Listen up!
I'm afraid there is only one solution to this horrible crisis:
We'll all have to fight for it.
- We can't fight for it.
- That's crazy.
That's not fair.
You'd win!
Exactly, Shirley.
I'm Bob...
Sorry, folks, but life isn't fair.
I'm in charge now, thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion.
Please, Makunga, this is the only water on the reserve.
If you're thirsty, you'll have to look for water off the reserve.
- Off the reserve?
- It's too dangerous!
Hunters would shoot us!
No one leaves the reserve and survives!
I left the reserve!
And survived.
I can do something about this.
Looks like a clogged pipe, like we get in New York.
I'll travel upriver...
- Upriver?
- Off the reserve?
You?
Yeah.
I'll unclog the pipe and bring back your water.
Great!
I'd help you pack, but by the looks of that hat, I see you're all set!
Fine.
Go ahead, laugh.
Laugh your mane off.
I'll prove you wrong.
Maybe you should try a little rain dance.
Zuba would know what to do.
- Where's Zuba?
- You don't care about us.
Zuba should be in charge, not you.
All right, fine!
As an added measure, I will consult with Zuba!
Marty?
Hey!
Marty!
Marty?
Marty.
Where'd you get the fruity hat?
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
Hi.
Is Marty in there?
Anyone seen Marty?
Which one of us is Marty?
All right.
Well, if you see him, tell him his friend Alex came to say goodbye.
Goodbye?
Don't go.
Where are you going?
- Can we come?
- No.
I have to do this alone.
You can't leave the reserve!
What are you doing?
- They'll get your hat.
- Hunters are everywhere!
Could you leave the hat?
Marty!
I know you're in there.
Before I go, I got something I want to say.
You've been a great friend.
You've helped me so often to see the bright side of my problems that I never think of you having any.
I wasn't there for you when you needed me.
Just like back at the zoo.
What kind of friend does that make me?
A pretty lousy friend, I guess.
I just want you to know that I...
You're one in a million.
This is touching.
It is touching.
So could you turn around so I can tell you to your face?
That's right.
Gotcha!
I see you in there!
Yeah, you.
You, right there.
Twelfth row, two hundred and third from the left.
That's you, Marty.
I know it's you.
Know what makes you special?
These guys are white with black stripes.
You're black with white stripes.
You're a dreamer, Marty.
Always have been.
You have great taste in music and horrible taste in friends.
Well, not Melman and Gloria, but me.
OK, I'm in.
Marty, you can't come with me.
You don't have a choice.
- People are out there!
- You're crazy!
Come back!
The people will get you!
Don't lose the hat!
Bye, hat!
Any water?
No, just more diamonds and gold.
Don't give up hope.
Listen up!
I will help you!
There's only one way to get your precious water.
I, your beloved King Julien must simply make a small sacrifice to my good friends, the water gods, in the volcano!
What does that do?
What does that do?
Excellent question.
My sacrifice goes in the volcano.
The friendly gods eat up my sacrifice.
"Thank you for the sacrifice."
"Here, have another." "No, I've had enough."
"I'll be insulted unless you have another."
"I don't want another sacrifice!"
"Look at you!
You're skinny!" "No!
I've had enough!"
The gods eat the sacrifice.
They are grateful.
They give me some water, and then I give it to you.
What?
Does it work?
No!
I mean, yes.
Well, Maurice?
Ah, it's fifty-fifty.
We'll do it!
Excellent!
Now all I need is someone who would like to go into the volcano and get eaten by gods.
Any hands!
Hands, anybody!
I need someone, perhaps who has never found love, who could look death straight in the eyeball.
A real, genuine hero.
- I'll do it.
- Melman?
Hurry up!
Before we all come to our senses!
Melman, what is wrong with you?
I'm dying anyway.
If there's a chance it'll get you water, it's worth it.
Are you nuts?
I want you to know, back at the zoo, it was never the doctors or prescriptions that kept me going.
It was always you.
Seeing you every day.
That's what kept me going.
Melman!
Wait!
Melman!
Melman!
Melman!
You going to mope like this all day?
Don't "hmph" me.
Listen, Zuba.
A miracle happened.
Our son came back to us.
How come that is not good enough for you?
What are you saying, woman?
We lost him once, Zuba.
Let's not lose him again.
Zuba!
- Zuba!
- Get out of here!
What do you want?
It's awful.
The watering hole is dried up.
Dried up?
That's impossible!
There's nothing left!
You're alpha lion, Makunga.
What are you gonna do about it?
Your son, Alakay, he said he could fix it.
He's gone upriver.
- Off the reserve?
!
- No!
I tried to stop him.
I told him it was suicide.
He was determined to prove himself to you.
You stay here, in case he comes back!
Hurry, Zuba!
I'm so parched.
Is this place starting to freak you out?
We'll slip in, find the problem.
Hunters will never know we were here.
Why are we doing this?
Maybe my dad will think I'm...
I want to show him I'm a real lion.
As opposed to a chocolate lion.
I know this may sound hard to believe, but apparently, lions don't dance.
What?
!
As far as my dad is concerned.
As far as people are concerned, you're a hit.
In New York.
This is Africa...
much tougher crowd.
Marty, this is it!
This is the clog!
Come on.
Well, there's the water.
Stay down.
Look at that.
Knit one, purl two.
It's her.
- Is this right?
- Very good.
Nana, slow down.
You're a little tangled, aren't you?
No, don't pull.
I'll do it.
We need dynamite.
Got any?
Oh, snap!
I just used my last stick this morning!
- Savages!
- Evasive maneuvers!
- Serpentine, serpentine!
- Squiggly squid maneuver!
Zag, zig-zag, zig ziggy zag!
No, no!
Squiggly squid!
Etch A Sketch!
That's too complex!
Octopus, octopus!
- Run, Marty!
- I can't leave you here!
Go get help!
Squiggly squid maneuver!
Go!
Go!
Squiggly squid!
Etch A Sketch!
Etch A Sketch!
Save us We love you
OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- Save us
- Melman
- We love you
- Melman
Save us
OK, here we go.
OK, OK.
- Melman
- We love you
- Melman
- Save us
Here we go!
Here we go!
- What's all the hoopla about?
- Joe?
Joe the Witch Doctor?
We thought you were dead!
So did I. Then I realized I'm covered in brown spots.
So Melman's not dying!
- Melman's not dying!
- Oh, no!
Melman!
Move!
Don't do this!
Julien, stop this!
This is crazy!
Oh, suddenly throwing a giraffe into a volcano to make water is crazy!
Yes!
- Please, Melman!
Stop!
- Gloria?
- You can't do this!
- Why not?
Because...
You can't do this, Melman.
First, that hurts.
Second, I've only got 18 hours to live, anyway.
Melman, I gotta know did you mean those things you said about me?
Of course I did.
- That's crazy.
- It is?
It's crazy to think I had to go halfway around the world to find out the perfect guy for me lived right next door.
Then it's you and me, neighbor.
You and me for the next 18 hours.
I'll take whatever you got.
- Maurice, what happened?
- I believe the fat lady has sung.
- What's going on here?
- Marty!
Alex is in big trouble!
We got to get upriver fast!
- What about the plane?
- Perfect!
Come on!
The plane won't be fixed until the suits meet our demands.
Now, maternity leave.
Maternity leave?
You're all males.
We need that plane for a rescue mission.
There's nothing I can do until we bust up this union.
I'll bust up all of you if you don't get this plane going.
Can't you see these commies have my hands tied?
No maternity leave.
Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want these blowing around on the savanna.
All right.
You get your maternity leave.
Finally.
Where we headed?
What's going on?
Where are we going?
Oh, no!
Please!
Don't put me there!
No!
This is wrong.
You see?
You are survivors.
Now, how about a nice lion casserole?
You can't eat a lion.
Don't worry, it tastes like chicken.
No, no, no.
Don't listen to her.
She's out of her mind, people!
I'm from New York City!
It's me, Alex the lion!
From Central Park!
Dad!
What were you thinking, son?
You got no business being out here!
Stay behind me.
They're New Yorkers.
They're just rude and frightened people.
Stay back!
You'd let your dinner get away?
- What are you doing?
- The only thing I know how to do.
What the heck?
Hey, I know those moves.
Alex?
- It's Alex the lion!
- From Central Park!
It is Alex!
Only one lion can move like that!
He's beautiful.
I can't believe it.
How does he do that?
What are you doing?
I'm dancing with my son!
I think.
Don't think, Dad.
Feel!
Butterfly!
I'm feeling it!
I'm feeling it!
Roar!
That was beautiful.
Now let's eat!
Dad, look out!
What the...
Alex!
Get in!
She's got a gun!
Get out while we can!
- What?
- She's got a gun!
Get out while we can!
Pass it on!
He said let's have some fun and take out the dam.
Basset hound.
Skipper!
Alex wants to take out the dam.
All right!
But it's his funeral.
- Hard to port!
- Aye-aye, Skippy!
Bring it on!
Bring it on!
Come back!
That's my dinner!
Kowalski, full throttle.
Music!
- I like this song.
- It never gets old.
It does have a catchy hook.
Come about!
Bring her in low!
Hold onto your skirts!
It's dam-busting time!
Hold on tight, baby!
Here we go!
Tell them no!
Pull up!
They'll kill us!
There's got to be another way!
Pass it on!
They say no pull up.
Kill us.
There's no other way.
Basset hound.
Are you sure?
Men, there is no sacrifice greater than someone else's.
No!
Medic!
Ramming speed!
Bring it on!
Bad kitties.
I don't know why the sacrifice didn't work.
The science seemed so solid.
I'd jump right in that volcano if I wasn't so good at whistling.
It's you!
I found you!
Mort?
Bad fishy!
I wonder if the gods like seafood.
Let's find out.
Look, Maurice.
- That was quick.
- I did it!
I did it!
I did it!
OK, you did it!
Oh, yes!
Look!
- It's Alakay!
- It's Zuba!
You did it!
Alakay, Zuba, you did it!
Zuba!
Alakay!
You're back!
I'm so glad you're safe!
Out of my way.
Well, well, well.
You know, Zuba, if I remember correctly, you quit the pride.
And you were kicked out.
So don't think that this changes anything.
You're right.
In fact, we humbly present you with this token of appreciation.
A man bag.
Very popular where I'm from.
- Don't know what to say.
- Still be tough and carry your stuff.
Does the strap adjust?
This will go very nicely for me when I go out hiking.
But you're still banished.
We figured you'd say that.
My handbag!
You bad kitty!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
You deserve this, son.
Welcome to the pride.
Thanks, Dad.
But this belongs to you.
No, son.
To us!
My son!
The King of New York!
That's my baby!
Love transcends all differences.
We are gathered here today to celebrate such a love.
Do you take each other, for better or for worse?
For better, please.
What a beautiful, weird couple!
That's not going to last.
Can I kiss the bride?
No!
Music!
- Struts.
- Check.
- Flaps!
- Check.
- Diamonds and gold.
- Check.
- Bye-bye!

See you later!
We'll be back after the honeymoon in Monte Carlo, or whenever the gold runs out.
Come back soon!
Mom, let them take their time.
New York isn't going anywhere, right, guys?
You're right about that!
As long as I'm with her and you two, I don't care where we are.
She has the most amazing laugh.
Love has no boundaries!
Looks like you're stuck with us for a while.
Dad?
What's wrong?
I just thought we could hang out a bit and...
- You got me!
- I got you, son!
You got me with my thing.
You brought it back around on me.

The old man's not too bad, eh, Marty?

Well done boys.
It looks like ice cold sushi for breakfast.
No, no son.
Over here.
See the lion, look at the lion, you get the lion.
Now son, if you are going to grow up and be like your daddy someday you got to learn how to fight.
Alakay, let me show you something, OK?
You see this mark?
You and me are the same and when you're bigger, you are gonna be alpha lion just like your daddy.
Now, let me see you fight.
Ready?
No Alakay, no dancing.
You just amuse yourself, don't you?
You are a strange kid.
You are a strange man.
Oh come on, let's try it again.
It's so disappointing when they don't grow up the way you want it to.
Oh come on.
You are not challenging me again, are you?
Look on the bright side Zuba.
After I defeat you and take over as alpha lion, you will have so much more time to spend with your pathetic excuse of a son.
Before I kick your butt, let me ask you, why do you even want to become the alpha lion?
I am better looking, I have better hair, I am deceivingly smart and...
I want everyone else to do what I say.
We'll fight on three.
One.
Pay attention Alakay.
Daddy gonna show you how it's done.
Two, three.
Who is alpha lion?
You are.
Don't you forget it.
And that Alakay is how you attack.
Alakay?
That's it.
Here kitty kitty.
Ah, this one is a beauty.
It will be worth a few bucks.
It just gets easier and easier.
Daddy!
Alakay, Alakay, Alakay!
Daddy!
No, no, no!
Alakay!
Daddy!
Alakay!
Daddy got you, hold on.
Daddy!
Alakay!
Daddy!

I don't like looks of this guy.
Well, I think he is kind of cute.
I think he is kind of show off.
You think he is cute?
The king of New York City.
Alex the lion!
I still think he is kind of a show off.
You got to give it to him, the guy is an animal.
Maybe you should take a break.
You know, we could all use a vacation.
Come on.
Where on earth would we go on vacation.
I don't know about you but I wanna go to Connecticut.
On the loose, several animals including the world famous Alex the lion the king of New York escaped from the Central Park Zoo tonight.
The escapees were finally cornered in Grand Central Station.
It was a very bad kitty.
Animal rights activists who convinced zoo officials to have the escaped animals sent to Africa were stunned to learn that the shipping freighter carrying the animals was reported missing today.
Tonight hundreds of New Yorkers have gathered at the Central Park Zoo to mourn the loss of their beloved zoo animals.
The question on everyone's mind:
where are they now.
I like to move it, move it!
He likes to move it, move it!
She likes to move it, move it!
We like to?
Move it!
We are gonna miss you little fuzz buckets.
You guys had been a great crowd.
Glad we can introduce you to the toilet.
If you ever come to look at Central Manhattan, feel free to call first.
Seriously no, call.
OK?
Settle down, settle down everybody.
Ssh...
Be quite.
You can't leave without this.
Hey.
Surprise freaks!
Look.
Shake it, shake it.
Yeah, I am a lady, I am a lady everyone.
I am a lady.
Not really, it's me, it's King Julien.
Which of you was attracted to me?
Hands up.
Hey freaks!
You will be very glad to hear that I am coming with you.
Oh no, thank you.
Yes thank you.
It's my plane.
Until I return with the spoils from the new country Stevie will be in charge.
I don't think they liked that idea so much Julien.
What is that you are saying Stevie?
Oh, oh, no!
What?
Really?
No, you didn't say that.
Oh it's not even possible.
Stevie says:
Let them eat the cake!
King Julien wait for me.
I'm all packed.
I have such a whole itinerary plan.
Oh no.
It's Mort.
He's so annoying.
Don't let him on.
Stop that thing, he is carrying scissors and hand cream.
Everybody in quickly.
Get in.
Get in.
Get in quick.
Get in quick.
Struts.
Checked.
Fillets.
Checked.
Engine.
Checked.
Coffee mate.
Checked.
Oopsie daisy.
That is got to be the second biggest slingshot I have ever seen.
But it is got to have to do.
Attention.
This is your captain speaking.
In the event of a water emergency, place the vest over your head then kiss your life good bye!
New York City, here we come baby.
[Skipper] ...sit back, relax and pray your personal gods that this hunk of junk flies.
Personal god, hunk, what?
We are going sir.
Open the door.
I am outside.
In case of losing cabin pressure, please place the mask over your face to hide your terrified expressions from the other passengers.
Excuse me miss.
But aren't these supposed to be attached to my seat.
No sir.
OK. boys.
Launch.
Launch.
Launch.
Launch.
Melman!
Hey, Mort.
Hi.
That was weird.
Hey, somebody is dreaming ha?
I think I just saw Mort on the wing of the plane.
You got Madagascar on the brain.
... it was quite a, it was incredible, wasn't it?
I think we will see much more fun the further way we get from.
Yeah, like when you beat me on the butt?
I am gonna take that, that thing you are holding on to and I am going to use it, on stage.
So all part of my little actor's salad bar of emotional tidbits.
Are the butts next to the crutons at the salad bar?
You don't need to be sarcastic Marty.
Hey guys, you know, I was thinking.
When we get back, I might assign up for the breeding program.
Breeding program?
I think we all reach a point on our lives when we wanna meet somebody, you know settle down, have a relationship.
I see that.
What?
Like, like dating?
Yeah, dating!
Other, other...
Other guys?
What do you mean "other guys"?
Darn it!
I'm gonna, what is holding up that beverage service.
I'm gonna go and check.
Oh, yeah ya, keep talking.
I'm gonna catch a few wings.
Did you see that?
It is so funny.
I like laughing.
It is such a nice experience.
To laugh.
Do you mind going back?
This is first class.
It's nothing personal, it's just that we are better than you.
Hey Maurice.
I'm awful, hit me, hit me.
Is it Vivaldi?
Hey, in flight slave.
Can I help you Mr. Mankiewicz?
Bring me my nuts, on a silver plate.
We just wanted to check on the drinks we ordered.
Oh, sorry.
We are in a little backed up.
Then I guess I am gonna back to..
Hey, what happened to your body?
You are freaking me out.
And can you please go over there please.
Thank you very much.
Whatever happened to the separation of the classes.
Yeah, I am sure is all democracy thing is just affeered.
Skipper, look.
Analysis.
It looks like a small incandescent bulb designed to indicate something out of the ordinary.
Like a malfunction.
I found it pretty and somewhat hypnotic.
That too sir.
Right.
Rico, manual.
Problemo solved.
Sir, we may be out of fuel.
What makes you think that?
We lost engine one.
And engine two is no longer on fire.
Buckle up boys.
Don't look dull.
This might get hairy.
Attention.
This is your captain speaking.
I've got good news and bad news.
The good news is, we will be landing immediately.
The bad news is, we are crush landing!
When it comes to air travel, we know you have no choice what so ever.
But thanks again for choosing air penguin.
Raise your arms Maurice.
It's more fun when you raise your arms like this.
I can fly.
This could be it Marty.
I just want you to know that you are truly a one in a million friend.
Thanks buddy.
You are the best ever.
I know you won't mind when I tell you...
Come on.
Tell me it, tell me, tell me what?
I broke your iPod!
What!
The button were so small.
It made me mad.
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna kill you!
I love you Gloria, I always have!
Like ah...
Like you love the beach or a good book.
Or the beach.
My goodness doll, you are shaking like a leaf.
Rico, you had your fun.
Haul up!
Gear down.
Gently now.
You just wanna kiss the ground.
Just a little pack, smooch like a kiss...
I said kiss it!
Now, just a little break.
Just a touch, a little whisper.
I believe that's checkmate.
Immersed emergency landing procedure.
Flaps up!
Deploy!
Oh, we are here.
What in the world?
What happened to the plane?
OK.
I'm OK.
OK.
I'm alive.
See, I can't even sleep for a minute.
You know what, this is not JFK.
Kowalski, casualty report.
Only two passengers unaccounted for, Skipper.
That's a number I can live with.
Good landing boys.
Who says a penguin can't fly.
Hey, happy slappers.
Is there some reason to celebrate?
Look at the plane.
We'll fix it.
Fix it?
How you gonna fix this?
Grit, spit and a whole lotta duct tape.
We should be up and running in say, six to nine months.
Sixty nine months?
No!
Six to nine months.
Kowalski, I say we use this setback to our advantage.
Where do you get, where do you pull that number out of, huh?
I want you to reconfigure the design, so start reconfiguring!
Great, that's a great...
How do you estimate that?
You!
Pretty boy!
Why don't you and your friends dig a tree, maybe find water.
Hold on, hold on a second.
Who made you king of the plane wreck?
Excuse me.
Fine, you can be in charge.
You fix the plane!
Who gives you the authority to put me in charge?
OK then, I'll remain in charge.
Yeah, that's right.
You will remain in charge.
You and your little happy friends can stay out of our hair.
Correctamundo!
Because I decided to.
Good for you.
Yeah, well guess what this discussion isn't over.
Higher mammals, you stay with us.
We could use your front cortexes and apposable thumbs.
Feel crushed wash your hands out with soap.
How, in the..
Hello!
are they gonna fix this plane?
You know, grit 'n spit and spit, once spit and griten.
Stick to it at mist.
They don't sound too promising.
You're right.
Right, we are stuck here.
Hey guys, as long as we're together we'll be OK.
Yeah, yeah but love ain't gonna get us home.
Behold, the lion!
Hey, it's people.
OK.
There is much to see, moving on.
People.
Wait, wait.
Wait people.
Hey wait, if you stop we'll autograph those.
I know you.
You.
It's that bad kitty.
How do you like some other?
Right in the batteries!
You think that old lady can't take care of you?
Next time I won't go so easy on you.
Thank you dear.
Moving on.
Are you out of your mind?
We need their help, and you're arresting little old ladies?
Out of my mind?
Aha!
Who is out of my mind?
See if you can get an operator?
No problem.
Out of my mind?
We're going home.
Message A-4: the service user has brought outside of the coverage area.
Please try again later.
Oh my..
Wow...
Am I trappen?
All those zebras, like me.
Wait a minute, where are we?
San Diego.
This time I'm forty percent sure.
I know this place.
I think this is Africa.
Africa?
It's gotto be.
Our ancestral crib.
It's in our blood.
I can feel it.
No, no.
It's more than that.
It's like dejavu.
Like I've, like I've been here before.
It's like roots.
No, no.
It's like dejavu.
Like I've, like I've been here before.
How?
How?
Me, Alex.
Me and me friends.
Fly.
Fly.
In great metal bird.
Then.
Plummet.
Smash ground.
Go boom.
Then here.
We emerge.
We offer only happiness and good greetings.
Is he dancing about a plane crash.
Yeah, we just...
Yeah.
I thought.
Sorry.
You mean, you came from off the reserve.
Yeah, way off, from the Central Park Zoo actually.
Don't strain yourself.
What is going on here, what is all this have about?
They say they are from off the reserve.
That's impossible.
Only people come from off the reserve.
You look familiar, do I know you from...
How could you possibly survived the hunters.
Hunters, we didn't see any hunters.
What are you looking at?
Me?
Nothing.
This watering hole doesn't need any more mouths to feed.
So just get out of back to wherever you came from.
OK.
Was there a maybe like a manager we can talk to?
Oh, I see.
You're here to challenge me.
What?
No!
No, no.
What else would start you look on to me?
Hold on, Zuba, wait.
Don't call woman, don't you see I am trying...
Yeah, yeah...
Zuba.
Hold on.
Alakay, is that you?
No, it's Alex. "X", like New York Knicks.
- Zuba, look.
Oh, I have always had that, have had checked it out, it's really... it's kind of a beauty spot, really.
Mark.
Alright, this is a little weird.
Honey, he has come home.
What?
You've come home.
Son.
Dad.
Mom and dad.
Mom and dad.
Mom and dad.
It's my mom and dad.
I've got a mom and dad.
My baby is alive.
My son.
My son is home.
Alakay, yeah.
The pathetical son returns.
This is perfect.
I thought you hated Zuba.
No I do.
I do, I do.
I hate him.
Oh, I do.
And I am going to use Alakay.
Yes.
I am going to use him to get rid of Zuba once and for all.
Move out of the way, stand aside.
New York.
Hmm, it's a bit of a dumb.
Are you sure we are not in New Jersey?
Hello New Yorkers, your new king is here.
This calls for celebration.
Maurice, I think they like me.
You got to love a known house to take off.
Chaka chaka what?
Excuse me, excuse me.
I'm Marty.
I'm kind of new around here.
Hey Marty.
Hey, you are a good looking group.
You like to run?
Oh yeah.
Running is crackalacking.
That's right, that's right, crackalacking.
You guys are speaking my crackalacking language.
What, you don't have doctors here?
Well, not any more.
What if you catch a cold?
We go over to the die holes and we die.
OK, you guys really need a doctor.
Hey, we have an opening.
Would you be interested?
Me?
A doctor?
It's raining men, hallelujah.
You are gotto going all.
How come you don't have a man in your life.
Listen girls, Manhattan is short on two things:
parking and hippos.
Hey everybody!
I just found out that my son is a king.
The king of New York.
Show me some of your moves son.
Come on.
Don't be bashful.
Alright.
Ooh, this one always knocks them dead.
The king is mad, the king is mad.
Now, let's all welcome him back into the pride above the arms.
Welcome to the herd Marty.
Me, in a herd?
I've always wanted to be a part of a herd.
It's one for all, and all for all.
How do I look?
Technicly, a traditional witch doctor has a bone to his nose.
Don't worry, it has just a clip on it.
Voila, he's a witch doctor.
My mother would be so happy.
Look out.
I think Moto Moto likes you.
Here he comes.
I like 'em big.
I like 'em chunky.
I like 'em big.
I like 'em plumpy.
I like 'em round.
With something, something.
They like my sound.
They think I'm funky.
Goodness girl.
You're huge.
Who is your friend, or is that your butt?
Girl, you are as quick as you all have to.
So, you are Moto Moto.
The name is so nice, when you say it twice.
I kind of a like it that so.
I see you around new.
I won't be hard, because you're so plumpy.
Oops.
I hate to be a party pooper Zuba but some of the other lions are wondering when you are going to banish your son.
What are you talking about, Makunga?
It's nothing really, if their great being about who Alakay never went through the rite of passage, bla bla bla...
So, technically speaking he can't be a member of the pride, it's nonsense.
I had forgotten about the rite of passage.
What is it?
What is this rite of passage?
It's a traditional common of a ceremony where young lions earn their manes by demonstrating their skills.
Sort of a show skill, talent show, tab dale?
Yeah, sturdiness stuff.
Great informers.
I think that's up my alley guys.
If it's tradition, I want to do it.
Stud my stuff.
Earn my mane.
I want to be Alakuy.
Alakay.
Alakay.
Even better.
We'll hold the rite of passage first thing in the morning.
That's wonderful.
Good luck Alakay.
Where I come from we say:
Break a leg.
Oh, that's my boy.
Beautiful, isn't it?
Yeah.
It's amazing.
Guys, this is where we belong.
Operation tourist trap is in go.
Oh, I like that one.
That's a good one.
That works on many levels sir.
You guys are a bunch of suck ups.
That too sir.
Absolutely.
Hide.
Stations.
Stage one.
Go.
Oh no.
What've I done.
Come on, take the bait.
Stage two.
Go, go, go.
I'll give him the kiss of life.
Rico.
Rico!
Reverse.
Gas.
Music.
Oh no, stop.
Stop.
Stop.
Come back.
What is all that rock'n roll racket?
Is she dead?
No!
You hood ones!
Good heavens.
Are you OK?
Lady, I found your pocket bag.
Oh, my hand bag.
Such a good boy.
Man, I can't survive without it.
Wow, you are a one tough cookie.
Brownies, root for sixteen.
Yonkers.
OK.
Nobody panic.
The best thing we can do is stay together.
We'll wait for another tour jeep.
It may take hours and it's getting dark but...
Where are you going?
I'm not gonna stay out in the opening get attacked by more animals.
I'm too old to die.
I don't know about you guys but I'm going with her.
Please!
We need to stay...
together.
Fine, we'll go that way.
Does anyone want a hot candy?
Easy now.
Watch your step.
And this, right here.
OK.
Are you ready?
This is where you always slept.
Oh man!
Was this mine?
Look at you.
Look at him honey.
Oh my.
Oh this thing.
Look, look.
I remember this.
You remember.
Harder than I...
You never slept on the right end.
You always slept on the bottom end.
Was that, was that my?
Is that me?
You had the cutest little paws.
Little bit of paws.
You did that the day we lost you.
Wow.
I was so young.
What happened to me?
It was all my fault.
I turned my back for a minute and...
It was not your fault.
Your father did everything he could.
He tracked those hunters for weeks.
Far off the reserve.
Finally I had to assume that the hunters...
Well...
We thought, we thought they killed you.
But my son fought those hunters off ha?
Don't mess with the king of New York.
That's right.
Alright, alright boys.
Be careful.
Watch out before you break something.
You used to call this Fufi.
Fufi?
Fufi.
Oh, he doesn't want that thing.
Give my Fufi.
Zuba, you'd better give him his Fufi.
I mean no, thank you, thank you.
It's perfect.
Well son, you get your rest, you'll have a big day tomorrow.
You're gonna need all your strength.
I'm gonna bring the house down for you dad.
I hope so, otherwise your father would have to banish you.
Oh gee, not really?
I know you're gonna do us proud.
You know why?
You were born with it.
Good night Alakay.
My boy, my own boy.
My son is a king.
My son is a king.
Good night mom.
Good night Alakay.
No sign of civilization.
Everybody appears very tired.
I think we're lost.
Hey Nana, do you even know where you are going?
No, but I'm going with a skip in my step and a smile on my face.
Sure, right, OK.
Yeah, alright.
It's people.
Where do you come from?
How could we get out of here?
Can you help us, we're lost?
We are lost too.
It was awful, a flash of black and white never gone.
They took the jeep, everything.
That happened to our jeep too.
What are we gonna do?
Only hope to survive out here!
No food, no water, no shelter.
What are we gonna do?
You can let nature get the best of you, or you can get the best of nature.
Gather around children.
We are New Yorkers, right?
Yeah.
We survived in a concrete jungle.
If we need food, we hunt for a decent hotdogs stand, am I right?
She is right.
If we need shelter, we build skyscrapers.
If we need water, we build a dam.
Come on, we're New Yorkers.
If we can make it there, we can make it anywhere.
I'm coming King Julien.
Skipper, we have all the parts we need but we're slightly behind schedule.
How slightly?
Six to nine years.
Sixty nine years?
No six to nine years.
Privates, what happened to our thumbs?
Haven't seen them since yesterday sir.
Damn you...
Nobody goes AWOL on my watch.
Private, you are coming with me.
Rico, you are coming with me.
I'm tracking down to bring them for the court marshall.
That won't be necessary.
We have recruited a few extra thumbs for you, Skipper.
Floppy of monkeys entered.
I doubt that.
Enough wallin' gagging now let's get to work.
We'll divide into three groups.
Group alpha, you are charged in seeping of fabrication.
Group Offset, you'll handle assembly.
Group George Report: you'll handle gas services.
Any questions?
Good, then let's get to work.
I'd like to kiss you monkey man.
Alright but you are so darn ugly.
Alright, so little cubs cats, just remember great dance performance comes from the heart.
Just comes straight from your heart and you never go wrong.
Sure Mr. Hey Alakay, I just happened to walk by and wanted to wish luck.
You're not nervous, are you?
No, it's my thing.
You know.
It's kind of what I do.
In my opinion; the key of this whole thing is choosing the right competitor.
Oh, you mean this is like a dance battle, sort of thing?
Like a dance off?
Sure.
Great, I loved that.
Freestyle, put your moves out.
Who do you thing would be a good match for me?
You know, just to keep the things interesting.
Well...
I wish I could help, but that's strictly against to our ancient tradition and although we hold secret but
If I was me out there, I'd choose Titsy.
Titsy, OK?
Sounds interesting.
Makunga, right?
Thank you.
Anything for Zuba's boy.
Go, get him tight.
Shake it out.
Let us begin the rite of passage ceremony.
Come on baby, make mama proud.
Oh woman, I'm trying to take care of passage here.
Got it mom.
So who will be the first participant?
Me, me me...
How about you, the tall, handsome one?
Right there, yeah.
Choose your opponent.
Let me see.
I guess I'll pick Titsy.
Titsy?
Why did he pick Titsy?
Oh, that's my boy, he got some gumption there.
Somebody wake him up, wake him up.
Alright, so Titsy.
Come on.
Let's do this ha?
Come on Titsy fly, Titsy fly, come on let's see your stuff.
Bring it.
Let's dance.
OK.
But it's only fair to warn you that I'm a prodigy of fupsy and robbins.
Not dance dance, fight.
Oh, dance fight.
You got it.
Is he dancing?
What is he doing?
I know that boy is not dancing.
This is even better than I thought.
Alakay, turn around.
No no pap, it's hop shuffle ball change, hip swish, turn around.
Oh no.
Alakay.
Are you hurt?
Oh yeah, I'm.
Did I, did I win?
Oh no son, how could, I mean how could this happen?
You told us you were a king.
And a king does not get beat.
Well, I'm a king.
I'm a king in New York.
It's my stage name.
I'm like a, you know, It's for what I perform.
Perform?
No, this is horrible.
Alakay has failed the test.
Who would have ever imagine that the day Zuba would have to banish his own son.
- Zuba, no.
Zuba, yes.
Sadly the alpha lion must cast out all failures.
Then, I'm no longer the alpha lion.
Dad, what are you doing?
Dad no, you can't do this.
Who could possibly take Zuba's place?
Anyone?
Someone?
No one?
Hey.
You sir.
I guess not.
Well I, this is all very awkward, but I suppose, I could carry this tremendous burden.
Titsy, get the hat.
As your new leader, I hereby banish Alakay he shell wear this hat of shame and leave the watering hole.
For a thousand years or life whichever comes last.
Come on.
Shoo shoo.
Get out of here.
You should have told us son.
You should have told us that you weren't a real king.
You never told me that I have to fight anybody.
What did you expect son?
I don't know, maybe a fatherly advice, like: hey son it's a fight.
You are a lion, aren't you?
But I never fought another lion in my life.
Yeah, yes, right.
You dance.
And other stuff.
The point is, your pal, Makunga set me up back there.
I mean, none of these would happen...
If you were a real lion...
Zuba.
Yeah, I said it.
A real lion?
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Saw, stitcher.
Swallow.
You're in my light Steaven.
Oh, say.
You've got a brown spot there on your shoulder.
Yeah, that's very observative of you Steven.
As you can see, I'm covered in brown spots.
OK.
That bone will be good as new in a few weeks.
So, I don't have to pick another dying hole?
No, Timo.
You've got your whole life ahead of you.
Really?
Go out there and grab a bite of that horns.
Thank you doctor Mankiewicz.
Break a leg.
Sweet kid.
This spot looks like witch doctor's disease.
Witch doctor's disease?
That's the most ridiculous disease, I've ever heard of, Steven.
Wow...
Don't ask.
Someone has been naughty.
OK.
This one will hurt a bit.
Joe, our last witch doctor, he had a spot just like that.
Monday Joe, Wednesday no Joe.
Wednesday no Joe?
I can breathe.
Thanks doc.
So, this witch doctor's disease is a real thing?
You'll find a cure.
Hey, you got at least forty eight hours.
But I have never even heard of it.
What?
I mean, I don't have any penicillin.
I'm gonna need a catscan just to get started.
You'll have a lion looking over, they'd be happy to.
Ta daaa.
That guy has got talent.
Bet you haven't seen that one before.
This knock 'em dead in New York.
Hey, let's all give it a try.
Yeah, let's do it.
Well, hey hey hey, I know you want to but it's gonna take years of practice you get never gonna quite get a tight stream until you build up your lip muscles to the point where you can purse your lips like this.
You got it?
Ta daa...
How did you?
You guys got it right up the box.
If you can do it.
We can do it.
It's in our blood.
I always thought, I was a little bit unique.
We are unique.
Hey, we are like a force of nature.
A million points of light.
And all stripes.
Exactly the same.
Exactly the same.
Looks impressive Kowalski, but will it fly?
Yes, if we fold it here, here and here.
Nice.
Oh man, my dad thinks I'm a total loser.
I have ruined my parent's lifes.
That is definitely not crackalacking.
It's lacking in the craken my friend.
I have got to fix this.
So, there is there is something I gotto tell you.
Hey guys.
Is this place great or what?
I'd go with or what.
Oh well, I tell you what.
You're not gonna believe it but;
I got a date with Moto Moto.
Who is Moto Moto.
Oh, he's so big and handsome and big.
You know what Moto Moto means?
Twins?
It means hot hot.
Hot hot?
OK, when did you start parley in African?
It's in my blood.
Don't worry.
You can flirt around with Mr. Hot Pants after I'm gone.
What's the deal Melman?
Why am I the parade and you are the rain?
Why do you have to dry the parade under my rain?
Maybe I'll just parade myself in another part of town.
Fine by me.
By the way, the main streets mine.
Well, you can have your old stinking main streets.
And you can take your hottie tub flood and you Mr. hot, Moto Moto Jr. comes...
My hottie tub what?
What are you talking about?
Come on Melman, why don't you just tell her?
You tell, what?
Tell her, what are you talking about?
I don't know what you are talking about.
So I guess, I'll go then.
You know what, don't bother.
Don't get up in my account.
Melman, Gloria.
Hey, I thought you guys were friends.
Come on guys, Marty is absolutely right.
Marty?
Marty?
Marty!
What the heck is going on?
You are not ooh..
He was no!
I thought he...
You are not him.
He is ooh...
You thought that guy was me?
No, no, no.
I mean yes, yes.
You do guys, come on.
You thought I was him?
You guys do kind of look a little a lot you look a lot alike.
Marty you look a lot alike, come on.
You laugh alike, you talk alike, he has the same sort of speech pattern...
I mean that is a little weird.
Really, you two guys are, come on Marty.
So you're saying there is nothing unique about me, I am just like any other zebra.
No, of course you are different.
How?
How?
OK.
I can't tell you apart.
Maybe you could wear a bell or something.
I don't know.
A bell?
OK. not a bell, no bell is a bad idea.
No, no, no.
How about a t-shirt that says: "I'm with stupid."?
I am not stupid.
Not you stupid, him stupid!
You know what?
While you have been off doing prancing pony with the new pussy.
I have been having pretty much the worst day of my life, OK?
It's always about you, isn't it?
My problems are just a little bit bigger than yours Marty.
All right, I couldn't tell you apart.
So what?
Yeah fine, run away Marty!
Run away.
That's what you do best, just like back in New York!
I'm right here.
But you can't tell that right?
Your one in a million friend hopes you enjoy your bigger than everyone else's problems, alone!
Good, leave!
I don't need you to help me solve my problems.
You know what?
You diame dust I can't tell which one is Marty.
Oh, which one is Marty?
Wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah!
I don't care.
Nice hat, you show off!
Marty don't go.
Look Maurice.
Here is the perfect spot for my semi-palace, so please fill in all these holes and relocate the roofed.
Oh, who'd leave a perfectly good head lying around.
What a waste.
Tell me about it.
I'm in my prime here.
I'm terminal, you know.
Probably only have another two days left to live.
That's a bomber man.
Oh, if I King Julien, that's my name.
Only had two days left to live.
I'd do all the things I have ever dreamed of doing.
Like what?
I'd love to became a professional whistler.
I pretty amazing that I did know.
But I wanna get luck even better.
I'd make my living out of it.
You know what else I'd do?
I'd invade a neighboring country and impose my own ideology even if they didn't want it.
It's easy for you to say, you are a king.
Yes.
And you are only just a sad little head.
But there must be something you want to do before you die.
Well...
There is this one thing.
What is it?
Tell me.
Well.
No, I couldn't.
I mean.
What is it?
You know, I just never really have the guts to tell Gloria, how I think about her.
What is it?
I don't really have the guts to tell Gloria, how I feel about her.
What is it?
I have always felt about her.
Fine, don't tell me!
Is it a woman?
Oh, you didn't tell me we are talking about a woman.
What are you afraid of?
You are dead man anyway, come on.
Yeah?
Yeah...
Yeah, you are right.
Well, you gotta march right up to this woman, right?
You look her right in the eye, you lean forward, right?
Just a little, almost all the way.
Then you let her, like, lean forward, just a little bit until you're just a lips distance away from each other.
And then you just tell her, how much you hate her.
Actually, it's, it's more like love her.
Oh, you slave dog.
You're a real player, you know that?
Now listen to me.
You gotto raise up.
I can't hear you.
Yeah.
Good.
You gotto raise up.
You gotto get out of the hole.
I'm raising up on the ground.
He's raising Maurice.
I'm raising Maurice.
You gotto go right up to this woman.
Yeah.
You gotto go right up to a fight.
Yeah, I tell her.
And then you gotto say:
Baby, I dig you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it.
I love that happy little head.
She loves me.
She loves my eyes.
She loves me.
She loves my ass.
She loves my roundness.
She loves that I'm chunky.
She loves that I'm plumpy.
She loves my healthiness.
She loves my zestiness.
She loves me restlessly.
She loves me forever.
She loves me, because she loves me.
Moto Moto before things get too serious, well I was wondering if I were to for example stay here I'd like to ask you Let your candy lips bring the messages to my ear canal.
Well I don't know, I have so many questions.
Well I promise, the answer will always be yes unless, no is required.
OK.
So, what is it about me that you find so interesting?
Oh, you're the most plumpiness girl I've ever met.
OK.
Other than that?
Let's see, you, you know, you are chunky.
Right.
Oh, my gosh girl you are huge.
You've said that.
Oh, yes right.
We don't have to talk no more.
Gloria!
Gloria?
Melman?
Melman, I want you to meet with Moto Moto.
Ah, Moto Moto.
Yeah.
Nice to, nice to meet you.
Well, I guess, I...
It's OK.
Melman.
Apology accepted.
Oh, yeah, right, yes.
That, yes, that's why I...
Good.
Oh, OK.
That's well, that's it then.
You good, we're kind of a busy here man.
No!
No, that's not it!
Listen Mototo, you'd better treat this lady like a queen.
Because you my friend, you found yourself the perfect woman.
If I was ever so lucky to find the perfect woman, I would give her flowers every day.
And not just any flowers, OK?
Her favorites are orchids.
White.
And breakfast in bed.
Six loaves of wheat toast with butter on both sides.
No crusts.
The way she likes it.
I'd be her shoulder to cry on and her best friend and I'd spend every day trying to think of how to make her laugh.
She has the most most amazing laugh.
Well, I mean.
That's what I would do, if I were you.
But I'm not.
So you do it.
Oh, OK.
What?
That was beautiful.
Anyways, where were we?
I'm huge.
Surprised to see me Makunga?
Well I'm here to set things straight.
Like a real lion.
Is this real enough for you?
How about this?
This is for setting me up.
This is for stealing my dad's job.
This is for humiliating my family.
And making me fun like a fool.
Had enough?
Sure fly away.
Coward.
The water, it's gone.
Oh no.
The watering hole has never gone dry before.
We're gonna need a lot more dying holes.
How could this happen?
Out of my way.
What is going on here?
The watering hole is dried up, there's barely enough water for one of us.
Yes, good observation Shirley.
I'm Boby.
Makunga what will we do?
Quiet!
Listen up.
I'm afraid there is only one solution to this horrible crisis.
We'll all have to fight for it.
Fight for it?
This is crazy.
That's not fair, you'd win.
Exactly Shirley.
I'm Boby.
Sorry folks, but life isn't fair.
I'm in charge now.
Thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion.
Please Makunga this is the only water on the reserve.
If you're thirsty you'll have to look for water off the reserve.
I left the reserve and survived.
I could do something about this.
Looks like a clogged pipe.
But we get in New York all the time.
I'll just travel up river.
Up river?
Off the reserve?
You?
Yeah me.
I'll unclog the pipe and bring back your water.
Great I'll help you pack but by the looks of that hat I see you're all set.
Yeah fine.
Go ahead laugh.
Laugh your mane off.
I'm gonna prove you're wrong.
May be you should try a little rain dance.
Zuba would know what to do.
Where is Zuba?
You don't care about us.
Zuba should be in charge, not you.
Alright, fine.
As an added measure, I will consult with Zuba.
Marty?
Marty?
Is Marty here?
Marty, I apologize to you.
I did wrong.
I'm sorry.
I overlooked your problems.
At that moment I realized that I was wrong, actually.
What kind of a friend does that make me?
Pretty lousy friend I guess.
Well I just want you to know that you're one in a million.
Isn't this touching?
This is touching.
So could you please turn around so I can tell you that to your face?
That's right.
Got you.
I see you in there.
Yeah yeah you.
That's right you, right there.
Twelfth row, two hundred and third from the left.
I see you Marty.
I know it's you.
You know what makes you special?
These guys...
They're white with black stripes.
You're black with white stripes.
You're a dreamer Marty.
Always have been.
You have a great taste in music and horrible taste in friends.
Not Melman and Gloria, me.
OK.
I'm in.
No Marty.
You can't come with me.
I don't believe you have a choice.
Any water?
No, just more diamonds and gold.
OK.
Don't give up hope.
Listen up.
I'll help you.
There is only one way to get your precious water.
I, your beloved King Julien, must simply make a small sacrifice to my good friends, water gods.
In the volcano.
What does that do?
What does that do?
Excellent question.
My sacrifice goes into volcano.
Then the friendly gods eat up my sacrifice.
Mmm..
Very nice.
Thank you for the sacrifice.
Please have another sacrifice.
No, I've had enough for the day.
Listen, I'm gonna be very unsettled unless you will have another...
I don't want another sacrifice, OK?
Look at you, you look skinny.
No, I think I've had enough, is that clear?
The gods eat the sacrifice, they are grateful, they give me some of their water.
Then I give it to you.
What?
Does it work?
No.
I mean yes.
Well, Maurice?
Yeah, it's fifty fifty.
Excellent.
Now, all I need is someone who'd like to go in the volcano and get eaten by gods.
Any hands?
Hands?
Anybody?
OK.
I need someone, perhaps who has never fall in love.
Who could look death, straight in the eye ball.
A real genuine hero.
I'll do it.
Melman?
Hurry up.
Before you all come to your senses.
Melman, what is wrong with you?
I'm dying anyways.
If there is a chance, it'll get you water, it'll be worthy.
Are you nuts?
Gloria, I just want you to know, back at the zoo, it was never the doctors or the prescriptions that kept me going it was always you.
Seeing you every day.
That's what kept me going.
Melman, wait.
You gonna mop around like this all day?
Don't hmph me.
Listen Zuba.
A miracle happened.
Our son has come back to us.
How come, that is not good enough for you?
What are you saying woman?
We've lost him once Zuba.
Let's not lose him again.
Zuba!
Zuba.
Get out of here.
What do you want Makunga?
It's awful.
The watering hole is dried up.
Dried up?
That's impossible.
There is nothing left.
Well, you are the alpha lion Makunga.
What are you gonna do about it?
Your son, Alakay.
He said he could fix it.
He has gone up river.
Off the reserve?
No!
I tried to stop him.
I told him it was suicide but he was determined to prove himself to you.
You stay here in case he comes back.
Hurry Zuba.
I'm so parched.
Is this place, aren't affright you out?
We'll slip in, find the problem.
Hunters'll never know we were here.
Why are "we" doing this?
Look, Marty maybe my dad'll think that I'm...
I just wanna show him, I'm a real lion.
As opposed to a chocolate lion.
I know this might sound hard to believe, but apparently lions don't dance.
What?
As far as my dad's concerned.
As far as the people is concerned, you're a huge hit.
That was New York.
This is Africa.
It's a much tougher crowd.
Marty, Marty.
This's it.
This is the clog.
Come on.
Here's the water.
Marty, stay down.
Look at that.
It's her.
Is this right?
Oh, very good.
We need dynamite, do you have any dynamite?
Oh, snap, I just used my last...
Alex!
Run Marty.
Come on, I can't leave you here.
Go, get help.
OK.
OK.
OK...
OK.
Here we go.
OK...
Here we go.
Here we go.
What is all the hoop about?
Joe?
Joe, the witch doctor?
We thought you were dead.
So did I. Then I realized, I'm covered in brown spots.
So, Melman's not dying.
Melman's not dying.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Melman!
Move out.
Don't do this.
Julien, stop this.
This's crazy!
Oh, certainly throwing a giraffe into a volcano to make water is crazy.
Yes!
Please, Melman stop.
Gloria?
You can't do this.
Why not?
Because I...
You can't do this Melman.
First of all, it hurts.
Second of all, I'll only have eighteen hours to live anyway.
Melman, I gotto know.
Did you really mean all those things you said about me?
Of course I did.
This is crazy.
It is?
It's crazy in the thing, I had to go half way around the world to find out that the perfect guy for me lived right next door.
Then I guess it's you and me neighbor you and me for the next eighteen hours.
I'll take whatever you got.
Maurice, what just happened?
I believe the fat lady has sobbed.
Hey, what's going on here?
Marty.
Hey, listen up.
Alex is in big trouble.
We get to get up the river fast.
What about the plane?
Perfect.
Come on.
The plane won't be fixed until the suits meet our demands.
Now, about maternity leave.
Maternity leave?
You're males.
Look, we need a plane for rescue mission.
Well, there is nothing I can do until we bust up this union.
I'm gonna get the busty not bully you if you don't get this plane going.
Can't you see these commies have my hands tied here?
No maternity leave.
Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want these blowing around on the savannah.
Alright, you get your maternity leave.
Finally.
Where are you headed?
What's going on?
Where are we going?
Oh no, please.
You are not gonna burn me there.
No, no, no.
This's wrong.
You see?
You are survivals.
Now, how about a nice lion casserole?
We can't eat a lion.
Don't worry, taste like chicken.
No, no, no, no.
Don't listen to her.
She is out of her mind.
People.
I'm from New York City too.
It's me, Alex the lion.
From Central Park.
Dad.
What were you thinking son?
You got no matter be not here.
This's it, I want you to stay behind.
Look dad, they're New Yorkers, they are just ruined and frightened people.
Stay back.
Are you gonna let them get away?
What are you doing son?
The only thing I know how to do.
Hey, all those moves...
Alex?
This is Alex the lion.
From Central Park.
This is Alex.
Only one lion can move like that.
This is beautiful.
I can't believe this.
How does he do that?
Dad, what are you doing?
Dancing with my son I think.
Don't think dad, feel.
Butterfly.
I'm doing it.
I'm doing it.
Oh, that was beautiful.
Now, let's eat.
Dad, look out!
What the?
Alex, get in.
She has got a gun.
Let's get out while we can.
What?
She has got a gun.
Let's get out while we can.
Pass it on.
He said, let's have some fun and take out the dam.
Pass it on.
Skipper, Alex wants to take out the dam.
Alright, but it's his funeral.
What?
Deploy.
Aye aye, Skippy.
Come back.
That's my dinner.
Kovalski, full proto.
Music.
Oh, I like this song.
It never gets old.
It does have a catchy hook.
Tell them, no, pull up.
She will kill us.
There is gotto be another way.
Pass it on.
They say, no pull up, kill us.
There is no other way.
Pass it on.
Are you sure?
There is no sacrifice greater then someone else.
No, medic!
Relic speed.
Bring it on.
Bad kitties.
I don't know why the sacrifice didn't work.
The science seem so solid.
I'd jump right in that volcano if I wasn't so good at whistling.
Oh, it's you.
I found you.
Mort?
I wonder if the gods like seafood.
Let's go find out.
Look, Maurice.
That was quick.
I did it.
I did it.
I did it.
OK.
You did it.
Oh yes.
Look.
It's Alakay, it's Zuba.
Zuba, Alakay.
You're back.
I'm so glad you're safe.
Out of my way.
Well, well, well, well, well.
You know Zuba, if I remember correctly, you quitted the pride, and you were kicked out.
So don't think for any instant that this changes anything.
You're right, in fact we humbly present you with this token of appreciation.
That is a man bag, very popular where I came from.
I don't know what to say.
You can still be tough and carry your stuff.
Does this strip adjust?
Yes.
I think this will go very nicely for me when I go out hiking.
But I'm afraid you're still banished.
We figured you'd say that.
My hand bag.
You bad kitty.
You deserve this son.
Welcome to the pride.
Thanks dad.
But this belongs to you.
No, no son, to us.
My son, the king of New York!
Love transcends all differences.
We are gathered here today to celebrate such a love.
Do you take each other, for better or for worse?
For better please.
What a beautiful weird couple.
That's not gonna last.
Can I kiss the bride Skipper?
No.
Music.
Struts?
Checked.
Fillets?
Checked.
Diamonds and gold?
Checked.
Bye bye.
We're gonna miss you.
See you later.
We'll be back after the honeymoon in Monte Carlo.
Or whenever the gold runs out.
Take cares.
Come back soon.
Hey you know mom, let them take their time.
New York is not going anywhere.
Right guys?
Yeah, you're right about that?
Well, as long as I'm with her.
And you two.
I don't care where we're.
She has the most amazing laugh.
Love has no boundaries.
Well, it looks like you're stucked with us for a while.
Dad, what's wrong?
I just thought we could hang out a bit and...
You got me.
I got you son.
You got me with my...
You did my thing.
You got a background on me.
I love it.
I got you son.
Old man is not too bad, hey Marty?
Marty?
Who's Marty?
Come on?
I don't know Marty.
Don't call me Marty.
You can't fool me.
I don't see no Marty.
Ain't no Marty here.
Marty, I can look into your eyes, and I know it's you.
Hey shake the hot thing.
Shake the hot thing.
Shake 'em.
Shake 'em.
Shake 'em.
Shake 'em...
Madagascar Escape 2 Africa.[2008].RDQ.DVDRIP.XVID.[Eng]
-DUQA
Well done, boys.
Looks like ice-cold sushi for breakfast.
No, no, son.
Over here.
See the lion?
Look at the lion and get the lion.
Now, son, if you're gonna grow up and be like your daddy someday, you gotta learn how to fight.
Da-da.
Now, Alakay, let me show you something, OK?
You see this mark?
You and me are the same.
When you're bigger, you'll be Alpha Lion, just like me.
Now let me see you fight.
Ready?
No, Alakay.
No dancing!
You just amuse yourself, don't you?
You're a strange kid.
You're a strange one.
I'm...
Now, come on, let's try it again.
No, Alakay.
Stop that right now.
Doggone it!
It's so disappointing when they don't grow up the way you want.
Makunga.
You're not challenging me again, are you?
Look on the bright side.
After I defeat you and become alpha lion, you'll have more time to spend with your pathetic son.
Before I kick your butt, let me ask you:
Why do you want to become the alpha lion?
I'm better looking, I have better hair, I'm deceivingly smart and I want everyone else to do what I say.
We fight on three.
One...
Pay attention, Alakay.
Daddy will show you how it's done.
Two, three!
- Who's the alpha lion?
- You are.
Don't you forget it.
And that, Alakay, is how you attack...
Alakay?
That's it.
Here, kitty, kitty.
This one's a beauty.
He'll be worth a few bucks.
Itjust gets easier and easier.
Daddy!
Alakay!
Alakay!
Alakay!
Da-da!
No!
No!
No!
Alakay!
- Daddy!
- Daddy's got you!
Hold on!
Da-da!
Alakay!
Daddy!
I've been around the world in the pouring rain

- I don't like the looks of this guy.
- He's kind of cute.
He's kind of a showoff.
You think he's cute?
Roar!
The King of New York City Alex the Lion!
I still think he's kind of a showoff.
The guy's an animal.
Maybe he should take a break.
You know, we could all use a vacation.
Come on, where would we go on vacation?
I don't know about you, but I want to go to Connecticut!
On the loose, several animals, including the world famous Alex the Lion, escaped from the Central Park Zoo tonight.
The escapees were cornered in Grand Central Station.
He was a very bad kitty.
Animal rights activists, who convinced zoo officials to have the animals sent to Africa, were stunned to learn that the freighter carrying the animals was reported missing today.
Tonight, hundreds of New Yorkers have gathered at the zoo to mourn the loss of their beloved zoo animals.
The question on everyone's mind, where are they now?
I like to move it, move it
He likes to move it, move it
She likes to move it, move it
- We like to
- Move it!
Come on!
Y'all know this one!
It never gets stale!
- We like to
- Move it!
We'll miss you little fuzz buckets!
You've been a great crowd!
Glad we could introduce you to the toilet.
If you ever come look us up in Manhattan, feel free to call first.
Seriously though, call.
OK?
Settle down, everybody.
Be quiet!
You can't leave without this!
Surprise, freaks!
Shake it!
Shake it.
Look, I'm a lady!
I'm a lady, everyone!
I'm a lady!
Not really!
It's me, King Julien!
Which of you is attracted to me?
Hands up!
Hey, freaks!
You will be very glad to hear that I am coming with you.
Oh, no, thank you.
Yes, thank you.
It's my plane!
Until I return with the spoils from the new country Stevie will be in charge!
I don't think they like that idea.
What are you saying, Stevie?
No.
Could we...?
No, you didn't say that!
How is that even possible?
Naughty little thing!
Stevie says...
Let them eat cake!
King Julien, wait for me!
I'm all packed!
I have a whole itinerary planned!
Oh, no!
It's Mort!
He's so annoying!
Don't let him on.
Stop that thing!
He's carrying scissors and hand cream!
Everybody in!
Quickly, get in, get in!
Get in quick!
- Struts.
- Check.
- Flaps.
- Check.
- Engine.
Coffee maker.
- Check.
You guys!
Copsie-daisy!
That has to be the second biggest slingshot I've ever seen.
But it'll have to do.
Attention.
This is your captain speaking.
In the event of an emergency, place the vest over your head then kiss your... good-bye.
New York City, here we come!
Pray to your personal God this hunk ofjunk flies.
Personal God, hunk...?
What?
We are go, sir.
Open the door!
I'm outside!
If cabin pressure is lost, place the mask over your face to hide your terrified expression.
Miss, aren't these supposed to be attached to my seat?
- No, sir.
- OK, boys, launch!
Launch!
- Launch!
- Launch!
Gremlin!
Hey, Mort.
Hi!
That was weird.
- Somebody's dreaming.
- I think I saw Mort on the plane wing.
You got Madagascar on the brain.
I know I'm gonna miss it.
It was incredible.
I think it'll seem more fun the further we are from it.
Like when you bit me on the butt?
I'm gonna take that thing you're holding onto and use it onstage.
It's all part of my little actor's salad bar of emotional tidbits.
Are the butts next to the croutons?
You don't need to be sarcastic.
When we get back, I might sign up for the breeding program.
Breeding program?
We reach a point when we want to meet somebody.
Settle down, have a relationship.
I can see that.
What?
Like dating?
Yeah, dating.
Other... other guys?
What do you mean, other guys?
Darn it!
What is holding up that beverage service?
!
I'm gonna go check.
You all keep talking.
I'm gonna catch a few winks.
It's so funny!
I like laughing!
It's such a nice experience!
To laugh!
Do you mind going back?
This is first class.
It's nothing personal.
We're just better than you.
Maurice, I'm open!
Hit me!
- He shoots, he scores!
- Is that Vivaldi?
- In-flight slave.
- Can I help you, Mr. Mankiewicz?
Bring my nuts on a silver platter.
We were checking on our drink order.
Sorry.
Been a little backed up.
- I guess I'll go back...
- Where's your body?
You're freaking me out!
Can you please go over there, please?
What happened to the separation of the classes?
I'm sure this democracy thing is just a fad.
We'll go out for pineapple, my bobbly-headed boobily-boo.
Skipper, look.
Analysis.
Looks like a small bulb used to indicate something unusual, like a malfunction.
I find it pretty and somewhat hypnotic.
That too, sir.
Right!
Rico?
Manual!
Problemo solved.
- We may be out of fuel.
- Why do you think so?
We've lost engine one and engine two is no longer on fire.
Buckle up, boys.
Don't look, doll.
This might get hairy.
Attention!
This is your captain.
I have good and bad news.
The good news is, we're landing immediately.
The bad news is, we're crash-landing.
When it comes to air travel, we know you have no choice.
But thanks for choosing Air Penguin.
Raise your arms, Maurice!
It's more fun when you raise your arms!
I can fly!
This could be it, Marty!
I want you to know you are a one-in-a-million friend!
Thanks, buddy!
You're the best ever!
- And you won't mind when I tell you...
- Tell me anything!
I broke your iPod!
The buttons were so small!
It made me mad!
- The horror!
- I'm sorry!
- I'll kill you, butt-biter!
- It was an accident!
- An accident!
- Butt-biter!
I love you, Gloria!
I always have!
Like you love the beach.
Or a good book.
Or the beach.
Goodness, doll, you're shaking like a leaf.
Rico, you've had your fun.
Pull up.
Gear down.
Gently.
You just want to kiss the ground.
Just a peck, a smooch, like you'd kiss your sister.
I said, kiss it!
Now just a little brake.
Just a touch.
I believe that's checkmate.
Commence emergency landing procedure.
Flaps up!
Deploy!
Oh, we're here.
What in the world?
What happened to the plane?
What did y'all do to the plane?
I'm OK.
I'm alive.
I can't even sleep for a minute.
This is not JFK.
Kowalski, casualty report.
Two passengers unaccounted for.
That's a number I can live with.
Good landing, boys.
Who says a penguin can't fly?
Hey, happy slappers!
Is there some reason to celebrate?
Look at the plane!
- We'll fix it.
- How are you gonna fix this?
Grit, spit and a whole lot of duct tape.
We should be up and running in, say, six to nine months.
- Sixty-nine months?
!
- No, six to nine months.
Kowalski, I say we use this setback to our advantage.
- Where'd you get that number?
- I want you to reconfigure the design.
How do you estimate that?
Pretty boy!
Why don't you and your friends dig a latrine.
Hold on.
Who made you king of the plane wreck?
Excuse me?
Fine.
You can be in charge.
You fix the plane.
Who gives you the authority to put me in charge?
OK, then I'll remain in charge.
Yeah, you will remain in charge.
You and your hippie friends stay out of our hair.
Correcto-mundo.
Because I decided to.
- Good for you.
- Well, this discussion isn't over.
Higher mammals!
Stay with us.
We could use your front cortexes and opposable thumbs.
Phil!
I should wash your hands out with soap.
How in the hell-o will they fix this plane?
!
You know, grit and spit and spit.
A lot of spit and grit and stick-to-it-iveness.
That don't sound too promising.
You're right.
We're stuck here.
As long as we're together, we'll be OK.
Yeah, but love ain't gonna get us home.
Behold!
The lion!
- People!
- There is much to see.
Moving on.
Wait, wait, wait!
People!
- They'll help us!
- Wait up!
- People!
Stop!
- Help us!
If you stop, I'll autograph those!
I know you!
You.
It's the bad kitty.
How do you like some of that?
!
Come in, Tokyo!
Right in the batteries.
You think an old lady can't take care of herself?
Next time, I won't go so easy on you!
Thank you, dear.
Moving on!
Are you out of your mind?
We need help and you harass old ladies?
!
Out of my mind?
Who's out of my mind now?
- See if you can get an operator.
- No problem.
Out of my mind.
We're going home.
Message E-4.
The service user has roamed outside the coverage area.
Please try again later.
Am I trippin'?
All those zebras...
like me.
- Where are we?
- San Diego.
This time I'm 40 percent sure.
- I know this place.
- I think it's Africa.
Africa?
It's got to be.
Our ancestral crib.
It's in our blood.
I can feel it!
No, it's more than that.
It's like déjà vu, like I've been here before.
It's like Roots!
No, it's like déjà vu, like I've been here before.
How!
How!
Me Alex!
Me and me friends fly, fly in great metal bird.
Then plummet!
Smash ground!
Go boom!
Then here we emerge.
We offer only happiness and good greetings.
Is he dancing about a plane crash?
Yeah.
We just... yeah.
I thought...
Sorry.
You came from off the reserve?
Way off.
From the Central Park Zoo, actually.
Don't strain yourself.
What's going on here?
They say they're from off the reserve.
That's impossible.
Only people come from off the reserve.
You look familiar.
Do I know you?
How could you survive the hunters?
We didn't see any hunters.
- What are you looking at?
- Me?
Nothing.
This watering hole doesn't need any more mouths to feed.
So skedaddle back to where you came from.
Is there a manager we could talk to?
I see.
You're here to challenge me!
What?
No!
No.
That's what it looks like to me!
Zuba!
Wait.
I'm trying to take care of business...
Yeah, yeah, Zuba.
Hold on.
Alakay?
Is that you?
No, it's Alex. lx.
Like New York Knicks.
Zuba, look!
I've always had that.
The vet checked it out.
It's kind of a beauty spot, really.
A mark.
All right, this is a little weird.
Honey, he's come home.
What?
You've come home.
Son.
Dad.
Mom and Dad?
Mom and Dad!
Mom and Dad!
It's my mom and dad!
I got a mom and dad!
My baby's alive!
Dad!
My son!
My son is home!
Alakay!
Alakay has come home!
Alakay!
Yeah!
The prodigal son returns.
This is perfect!
I thought you hated Zuba.
No, I do.
I do.
I do.
I hate him.
Oh, I do.
And I'm going to use Alakay, yes.
I'm going to use him to get rid of Zuba once and for all!
Giddy-up, feathered horse!
Make way!
Move out of the way!
Stand aside!
New York!
It's a bit of a dump.
Are you sure we're not in New Jersey?
Hello, New Yorkers!
Your new king is here!
This calls for a celebration!
Maurice, I think they like me.
You've got to love a non-hostile takeover!
Chukka-chukka what?
Excuse me.
I'm Marty.
I'm kind of new around here.
Hey, Marty!
You're a good-looking group!
You like to run?
Yeah.
Running is crack-a-lackin'.
That's right!
Crack-a-lackin'.
You guys speak my crack-a-lackin' language.
What?
You don't have doctors here?
Not anymore.
Well, what if you catch a cold?
We go over to the dying holes and we die.
You guys really need a doctor.
- We have an opening.
- Would you be interested?
Me?
A doctor?
It's raining men.
Hallelujah!
You all got it going on.
Why don't you have a man?
You got worms?
Oh, I got rid of those.
Listen, girls.
Manhattan is short on two things, parking and hippos.
Hey, everybody!
I just found out that my son is a doggone king!
The King of New York!
Show me some of your moves, son.
Don't be bashful.
All right.
This one always knocks 'em dead.
Roar!
Look out.
The King is mad.
The King is mad!
Let's welcome him back into the pride with open arms!
Welcome to the herd, Marty!
Me?
I've always wanted to be part of a herd!
- It's one for all...
- [all] And all for all, y'all!
How do I look?
Technically, a traditional witch doctor has a bone through his nose.
Don't worry... it's just a clip-on.
Voilà!
He's a witch doctor!
My mother will be so happy.
Look out!
I think Moto Moto likes you.
Here he comes.
I like 'em big
I like 'em chunky
I like 'em big I like 'em plumpy
I like 'em round With something' somethin'
They like my sound They think I'm funky
Goodness, girl... you huge.
Who's your friend?
Or is that your butt?
You as quick as you are hefty.
So you're Moto Moto?
The name's so nice, you say it twice.
I kind of like it, fatso.
I'll see you around, girl.
It won't be hard, because you so... plumpy.
Cops!
I hate to be a party pooper, Zuba, but some of the lions were wondering when you plan to banish your son.
- What are you talking about?
- It's nothing, really.
They're griping that Alakay never went through the rite of passage, blah, blah, blah, so technically speaking, he can't be a member of the pride.
It's nonsense.
I forgot about the rite of passage.
What is it?
What's this rite of passage?
A traditional coming-of-age ceremony.
Young lions earn their manes by demonstrating their skills.
- A show-of-skill talent show deal?
- Yeah.
Strutting their stuff.
A performance!
I think that's up my alley.
If it's tradition, I want to do it.
Strut my stuff.
Earn my mane.
I want to be Alaki.
- Alakay.
- Alakay!
Even better.
We will hold the rite of passage in the morning!
That's wonderful!
Good luck, Alakay.
Where I'm from, we say, "Break a leg."
That's my boy!
I'm a private dancer
A dancer for money
Any old music will do
Beautiful, isn't it?
It's amazing.
Guys this is where we belong.
Operation Tourist Trap is a go.
Oh, I like that one.
It works on many levels.
You guys are a bunch of suck-ups.
- That, too.
- Absolutely.
Stations.
Stage one.
Go!
Oh, no!
What have I done?
Come on, take the bait.
- What happened?
- Oh, look at the poor little guy.
Is it dead?
Stage two!
Go, go, go!
I will give him the kiss of life.
Rico!
Rico!
Reverse!
Gas!
Music!
No!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Come back!
What is all this rock'n'roll racket?
!
Is she dead?
No!
You hoodlums!
Good heavens!
Are you OK?
Lady, I found your pocketbook.
My handbag.
Such a good boy.
Nana can't survive without it.
You are one tough cookie.
Brownies Troop 416, Yonkers.
OK, nobody panic!
The best thing we can do is stay together.
We'll wait for another tourjeep.
It may take hours, but...
Where are you going?
I'm not staying here to be attacked by more animals!
I'm too old to die.
I'm going with her.
Old lady, wait up!
Please!
We need to stay together.
Fine!
We'll go that way!
Does anyone want a hard candy?
- Easy now.
- Watch your step.
And right here...
OK, are you ready?
This is where you always slept.
Oh, man!
- Was this mine?
- Look at you.
Look at him.
Oh, this thing.
Look, look!
- I remember this!
- He remembers.
A little harder than...
You never slept on the right end.
You always slept on the bottom end.
Is that...?
Is that my...?
Is that me?
You had the cutest little paws.
Little, little bitty ol' paws.
You did that the day we lost you.
Wow.
I was so young.
What happened to me?
It was all my fault.
I turned my back and...
It was not your fault.
Your father did everything he could.
He tracked those hunters for weeks.
Far off the reserve.
Finally, I had to assume the hunters well...
We thought they'd killed you.
But my son fought them off!
Don't mess with the King of New York!
- That's right!
- Keep your chin in.
You boys be careful!
Watch out before you break something.
You used to call this "foofie."
"Foofie"?
Foofie.
He doesn't want that.
This is my foofie!
Zuba, you better give him his foofie.
I mean, no, thank you, thank you.
It's perfect.
Son, you get your rest.
You have a big day tomorrow.
You'll need all your strength.
I will bring the house down for you.
I hope so.
Otherwise, your father will have to banish you.
Jeez, Mom, really?
I know you'll do us proud.
You know why?
You were born with it.
Good night, Alakay.
My boy.
My own boy.
My son's a king.
My son's a king.
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Alakay.
Foofie.
Look at foofie!
My foofie!
Foofie, foofie, foofie.
My foofie!
No sign of civilization.
Everybody appears very tired.
I think we're lost.
Nana, do you know where you're going?
No, but I'm going with a skip in my step and a smile on my face.
Sure, right, OK.
Yeah, all right.
- It's people.
- How did you get here?
- Can you help us?
We're lost.
- We're lost too.
It was awful.
A flash of black and white and they were gone.
They took the jeep!
- That happened to ourjeep too!
- What do we do?
How will we all survive?
No food, no water, no shelter.
What are we gonna do?
!
You can let nature get the best of you, or you can get the best of nature.
Gather 'round, children.
We're New Yorkers, right?
Yeah.
We survive the concrete jungle!
When we need food, we hunt for a decent hot dog stand.
- Am I right?
- She's right.
When we need shelter, we build skyscrapers.
- Exactly!
- When we need water, we build a dam.
We're New Yorkers, for crying out loud!
If we can make it there, we can make it anywhere!
I'm coming, King Julien!
Bad fishy!
Bad fishy!
No, shark, no!
Sit!
Why am I laughing?
We have all the parts we need, but we're slightly behind schedule.
- How slightly?
- Six to nine years.
- Sixty-nine years?
- No, six to nine years.
Private!
What happened to our thumbs?
Haven't seen them since yesterday.
Darn you, Darwin!
Nobody goes AWOL on my watch.
Private!
You're coming with me.
Rico!
You're coming with me!
- We'll bring them in for court martial.
- That won't be necessary!
We've recruited a few extra thumbs for you, Skipper.
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.
Oh, I doubt that.
Enough lollygagging.
Let's get to work.
There'll be three groups.
Group Alpha will do sheet metal fabrication.
Group Bronson handles assembly.
Group George Peppard, craft services.
Any questions?
Good!
Let's get to work.
I'd like to kiss you, monkey man.
All right, but you're so darn ugly.
Remember, little cub scouts, a great dance performance comes from the heart.
Straight from the heart, you'll never go wrong.
Sure, mister.
Hey, Alakay, I just happened to walk by, I thought I'd wish you luck.
- You're not nervous, are you?
- Nah, it's my thing.
In my opinion, the key to this is choosing the right competitor.
You mean, this is like a dance battle sort of thing?
- Like a dance-off?
- Sure.
Great.
I love that.
Freestyle.
Who'd be a good match for me?
Just to keep things interesting.
Well, I wish I could help, but that's strictly against our ancient tradition and all we hold sacred.
But if it was me out there...
I'd choose Teetsi.
Teetsi.
OK.
Sounds interesting.
Makunga, right?
Thank you.
Anything for Zuba's boy.
Go get 'em, tiger.
Shake it out.
A five, six, seven, eight.
Let's go, let's do this.
Let us begin the rite of passage ceremony.
- Come on, baby!
Make Mama proud!
- Woman, I'm trying to take...
On it, Mom!
Who will be the first participant?
Me!
Oh!
Me, me, me!
Me!
Me!
Me!
Me, me!
Please, me?
How about you?
The tall, handsome one.
Yeah.
Choose your opponent.
Let me see.
I guess I'll pick Teetsi?
Teetsi?
Why did he pick Teetsi?
That's my boy!
He's got some gumption there!
Somebody, wake him up!
All right, so, Teetsi, come on.
Let's do this, huh?
Come on, little tsetse fly.
Let's see your stuff.
Bring it.
- Let's dance!
- OK.
But let me warn you that I am a protégé of Fosse and Robbins!
Not "dance" dance!
Fight!
Dance fight!
You got it.
- Is he dancing?
- What's he doing?
I know that boy is not dancing.
This is even better than I thought.
Alakay, turn around!
No, Pop, it's hop, shuffle, ball change, hip swish, turn around.
Oh, no.
Alakay!
Are you hurt?
Yeah, I am.
Did I... did I win?
No, son.
How could this happen?
You told us you were a king.
A king does not get beat.
I am a king.
I'm the King of New York.
It's my stage name.
Like for when I perform.
Perform?
Oh, no, this is horrible!
Alakay has failed the test!
Who would have ever imagined that today Zuba would have to banish his own son?
Zuba, no.
Zuba, yes.
Sadly, the alpha lion must cast out all failures.
Then I'm no longer the alpha lion.
Dad, what are you doing?
Dad, no!
You can't do this.
Who could possibly take Zuba's place?
Anyone?
Someone?
No one?
You, sir!
I guess not.
Well, I... this is all very awkward, but I suppose I could carry this tremendous burden.
Teetsi!
Get the hat.
As your new leader, I hereby banish Alakay!
He shall wear this Hat of Shame and leave the watering hole for a thousand years, or life!
Whichever comes last.
Shoo, shoo!
Get out of here!
You should have told us you weren't a real king, son!
You never told me I'd have to fight anybody!
What did you expect?
!
I don't know!
Maybe a little fatherly advice like, "Hey, son, it's a fight!"
- You're a lion!
- But I never fought another lion!
No, I guess not.
You dance!
And other stuff!
Your pal, Makunga, set me up back there!
- None of this would have happened...
- If you were a real lion.
- Zuba!
- Yeah, I said it!
A real lion.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Saw.
Suture.
Swab.
You're in my light, Stephen.
You have a brown spot on your shoulder.
That's very observant, Stephen.
As you can see, I'm covered in brown spots.
OK!
That bone will be good as new in a few weeks.
So I don't have to pick out a dying hole?
No, you got your whole life ahead of you.
- Really?
- Go out and grab it by the horns.
- Thank you, Dr. Mankiewicz!
- Break a leg!
Sweet kid.
This spot looks like Witch Doctor's Disease.
Witch Doctor's Disease?
That's the most ridiculous disease I've ever heard of.
- Don't ask.
- Someone's been knotty.
This won't hurt a bit.
Joe, our last witch doctor, had a spotjust like that.
- And?
- Monday, Joe.
Wednesday, no Joe.
Wednesday, no Joe?
I can breathe!
Thanks, doc!
So this Witch Doctor's Disease is a real thing?
You'll find a cure.
You've got at least 48 hours!
But I've never heard of it.
I mean...
I don't have any penicillin.
I'll need a CAT scan just to get started!
Have a lion look you over.
They'd be happy to.
Ta-da!
- He has talent.
- Stupendous and tremendous.
Hollah!
Bet you've never seen that one!
Knocked 'em dead in New York!
- Let's all give it a try!
- Let's do it!
Well, you can try all you want to, but it takes years of practice.
You'll never get a tight stream until you build up your lip muscles to the point where you can purse your lips like this.
You got it?
Ta-da!
How did you...?
You guys got it right out of the box!
- If you can do it...
...we can do it.
It's in our blood!
I always thought I was a bit unique.
We are unique!
We are like a force of nature!
- A million points of light!
- And dark stripes!
Exactly the same!
Exactly the same.
Looks impressive, Kowalski, but will it fly?
Yes.
If we fold it here, here and here.
Nice.
Oh, man.
My dad thinks I'm a total loser.
I've ruined my parents' lives.
That is definitely not crack-a-lackin'.
It is lacking' in the cracking', my friend.
I've gotta fix this.
So there's...
There's something I gotta tell you.
Hey, guys.
Is this place great or what?
!
I'd go with "or what."
Well, I'll tell you what.
You're not gonna believe it, but I got a date with Moto Moto.
Who's Moto Moto?
Oh, he's so big and handsome and big!
- Know what "Moto Moto" means?
- Twins?
It means, "Hot Hot."
"Hot Hot"?
When did you start parlez-ing African?
It's in my blood.
Don't worry, you can flirt around with Mr. Hot Pants after I'm gone.
Melman, why am I the parade and you're the rain?
Why are you driving your parade under my rain?
Maybe I'll parade in another part of town!
Whoa, guys.
Main Street's mine!
Well, you can have it!
And you can take your hotee-tot float and Mr. Hotee Moto Moto...
- What are you talking about?
- What are we talking about?
Melman, just tell her.
What?
What are you...
I don't know what you're talking about.
I guess I'll go, then.
Don't bother.
- Don't get up on my account.
- Melman!
Gloria!
- I thought you guys were friends!
- Marty's absolutely right.
- Marty?
- Marty?
Marty?
What the heck is going on?
You're not...?
Oh!
He was...
I thought he...
You're not him.
He's...
Oh.
You thought that guy was me?
No.
I mean, yes, you...
Guys, come on.
You thought I was him?
You guys kind of do look a little...
You look a lot alike.
Marty, you look a lot alike.
You laugh alike.
Talk alike.
He has the same speech pattern.
It's a little weird, really.
I mean, come on.
Marty.
So you're saying there's nothing unique about me.
I'm just like any other zebra.
No.
Of course you're different!
How?
OK, I can't tell you apart.
Maybe you could wear a bell or something.
- A bell?
!
- OK, not a bell.
Bell's a bad idea.
How about a T-shirt that says, "I'm with stupid"?
- I'm not stupid!
- Not you, stupid!
Him, stupid!
You know, while you've been doing the prancing pony with your new posse,
I've been having the worst day of my life.
It's always about you, isn't it?
My problems are just a little bit bigger than yours.
I couldn't tell you apart.
So what?
!
Yeah, fine.
Run away, Marty!
Run away!
That's what you do best!
Just like back in New York!
I'm right here.
But you can't tell that, right?
Your one-of-a-million friend hopes you enjoy your bigger-than-anyone-else's problems alone!
Good, leave!
I don't need you to help me solve my problems!
You're a dime a dozen!
I can't tell which one's Marty!
Which one's Marty?
Wait a minute.
Oh, yeah, I don't care!
Nice hat, you showoff!
Marty don't go.
Giddy-up, giddy-up!
Giddy-up, giddy-up!
Look, Maurice!
The perfect spot for my summer palace!
Please fill in all these holes and relocate the riff-raff.
- Who'd leave a perfectly good head?
- What a waste.
Tell me about it.
I'm in my prime here.
I'm terminal, you know?
I probably only have another two days left to live.
That's a bummer, man.
If I, King Julien... that's my name only had two days left to live,
I would do all the things
- I've ever dreamed of doing.
- Like what?
I'd love to become a professional whistler.
I'm pretty amazing at it now, but I want to get even better, make my living out of it.
You know what else I would do?
I would invade a neighboring country and impose my own ideology, even if they didn't want it!
Easy for you to say.
You're a king.
Yes.
And you are only just a sad little head.
There must be something you want to do before you die!
- There is this one thing.
- What?
Tell me.
- No, I couldn't.
- What is it?
I never told Gloria how I feel about her.
What is it?
Please tell me!
I never had the guts to tell Gloria how I feel about her.
How I've always felt about her.
Fine.
Don't tell me!
Is it a woman?
You didn't tell me it's a woman.
What are you afraid of?
You're a dead man anyway.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're right.
You've got to march right up to this woman.
Look her right in the eye.
Lean forward.
Just a little, or almost all the way.
Then you let her lean forward a little until you're just lips' distance away from each other.
Then you tell her how much you hate her.
Actually, it's more like love her.
Oh, you sly dog!
Woof, woof!
You're a real player.
Now listen to me.
You got to rise up.
You hearing me?
- He didn't hear you.
- I can't hear you!
- You got to rise up!
- Rising up!
- Get out of the hole!
- I'm rising out of the ground!
- He's rising, Maurice.
- I'm rising, Maurice!
- Rising!
- You go right up to this woman!
Do you feel it?
- Go up to her face!
- Tell the truth!
- I'm going to tell her!
- Then you say, "Baby, I dig you!"
Yeah!
I'm going to do it!
I'm going to do it!
I love that happy little head.
She love
Moto Moto
She love
Moto Moto
She loves me She loves my eyes
She loves me She loves my thighs
She loves my roundness
She love that I'm chunky She love that I'm plumpy
She love my heftiness She love my zestiness
She love me restlessly She love me forever
She love me 'cause she love me
Moto Moto before things get too serious, well,
I was wondering, if I were to, for example, stay here I'd like to ask you...
Let your candied lips be the messengers to my... ear canal.
I have so many questions.
I promise the answer will always be yes.
Unless no is required.
So what is it about me that you find so interesting?
You're the most plumpenest girl I've ever met.
OK.
Other than that.
Let's see.
Yeah, well, you know... you chunky.
Right.
My gosh, girl, you huge.
You said that.
Yeah, that's right.
We don't have to talk no more.
Gloria!
Gloria.
Melman.
Melman, I want you to meet Moto Moto.
Moto Moto.
Yeah, nice to meet you.
- I guess I...
- It's OK, Melman.
Apology accepted.
Oh.
Yeah, right, that.
That's why I...
Good.
OK.
Well, that's it, then.
Good.
We're kind of busy here, man.
No.
No, that's not it.
Listen, Mototo, you better treat this lady like a queen.
Because you, my friend, you found yourself the perfect woman.
If I was ever so lucky to find the perfect woman,
I'd give her flowers every day.
And notjust any flowers.
OK?
Her favorites are orchids.
White.
And breakfast in bed.
Six loaves of wheat toast, butter on both sides.
No crust, the way she likes it.
I'd be her shoulder to cry on and her best friend.
I'd spend every day thinking of how to make her laugh.
She has the most amazing laugh.
That's what I would do if I were you.
But I'm not, so you do it.
OK.
What?
That was beautiful.
Anyways, where were we?
I'm "huge"?
Surprised to see me, Makunga?
Well, I'm here to set things straight, like a real lion!
Is this real enough for you?
How about this?
This is for setting me up!
This is for stealing my dad's job!
This is for humiliating my family!
And making me look like a fool!
Had enough?
Sure, fly away!
Coward.
The water.
It's gone.
It's never gone dry before.
- We'll need a lot more dying holes.
- How could this happen?
Out of my way!
What is going on here?
!
The watering hole is dry!
There's barely water for one of us!
- Good observation, Shirley.
- I'm Bobby.
Makunga, what do we do?
Quiet!
Listen up!
I'm afraid there is only one solution to this horrible crisis:
We'll all have to fight for it.
- We can't fight for it.
- That's crazy.
That's not fair.
You'd win!
Exactly, Shirley.
I'm Bob...
Sorry, folks, but life isn't fair.
I'm in charge now, thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion.
Please, Makunga, this is the only water on the reserve.
If you're thirsty, you'll have to look for water off the reserve.
- Off the reserve?
- It's too dangerous!
Hunters would shoot us!
No one leaves the reserve and survives!
I left the reserve!
And survived.
I can do something about this.
Looks like a clogged pipe, like we get in New York.
I'll travel upriver...
- Upriver?
- Off the reserve?
You?
Yeah.
I'll unclog the pipe and bring back your water.
Great!
I'd help you pack, but by the looks of that hat, I see you're all set!
Fine.
Go ahead, laugh.
Laugh your mane off.
I'll prove you wrong.
Maybe you should try a little rain dance.
Zuba would know what to do.
- Where's Zuba?
- You don't care about us.
Zuba should be in charge, not you.
All right, fine!
As an added measure, I will consult with Zuba!
Marty?
Hey!
Marty!
Marty?
Marty.
Where'd you get the fruity hat?
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
Hi.
Is Marty in there?
Anyone seen Marty?
Which one of us is Marty?
All right.
Well, if you see him, tell him his friend Alex came to say goodbye.
Goodbye?
Don't go.
Where are you going?
- Can we come?
- No.
I have to do this alone.
You can't leave the reserve!
What are you doing?
- They'll get your hat.
- Hunters are everywhere!
Could you leave the hat?
Marty!
I know you're in there.
Before I go, I got something I want to say.
You've been a great friend.
You've helped me so often to see the bright side of my problems that I never think of you having any.
I wasn't there for you when you needed me.
Just like back at the zoo.
What kind of friend does that make me?
A pretty lousy friend, I guess.
I just want you to know that I...
You're one in a million.
This is touching.
It is touching.
So could you turn around so I can tell you to your face?
That's right.
Gotcha!
I see you in there!
Yeah, you.
You, right there.
Twelfth row, two hundred and third from the left.
That's you, Marty.
I know it's you.
Know what makes you special?
These guys are white with black stripes.
You're black with white stripes.
You're a dreamer, Marty.
Always have been.
You have great taste in music and horrible taste in friends.
Well, not Melman and Gloria, but me.
OK, I'm in.
Marty, you can't come with me.
You don't have a choice.
- People are out there!
- You're crazy!
Come back!
The people will get you!
Don't lose the hat!
Bye, hat!
Any water?
No, just more diamonds and gold.
Don't give up hope.
Listen up!
I will help you!
There's only one way to get your precious water.
I, your beloved King Julien must simply make a small sacrifice to my good friends, the water gods, in the volcano!
What does that do?
What does that do?
Excellent question.
My sacrifice goes in the volcano.
The friendly gods eat up my sacrifice.
"Thank you for the sacrifice."
"Here, have another." "No, I've had enough."
"I'll be insulted unless you have another."
"I don't want another sacrifice!"
"Look at you!
You're skinny!" "No!
I've had enough!"
The gods eat the sacrifice.
They are grateful.
They give me some water, and then I give it to you.
What?
Does it work?
No!
I mean, yes.
Well, Maurice?
Ah, it's fifty-fifty.
We'll do it!
Excellent!
Now all I need is someone who would like to go into the volcano and get eaten by gods.
Any hands!
Hands, anybody!
I need someone, perhaps who has never found love, who could look death straight in the eyeball.
A real, genuine hero.
- I'll do it.
- Melman?
Hurry up!
Before we all come to our senses!
Melman, what is wrong with you?
I'm dying anyway.
If there's a chance it'll get you water, it's worth it.
Are you nuts?
I want you to know, back at the zoo, it was never the doctors or prescriptions that kept me going.
It was always you.
Seeing you every day.
That's what kept me going.
Melman!
Wait!
Melman!
Melman!
Melman!
You going to mope like this all day?
Don't "hmph" me.
Listen, Zuba.
A miracle happened.
Our son came back to us.
How come that is not good enough for you?
What are you saying, woman?
We lost him once, Zuba.
Let's not lose him again.
Zuba!
- Zuba!
- Get out of here!
What do you want?
It's awful.
The watering hole is dried up.
Dried up?
That's impossible!
There's nothing left!
You're alpha lion, Makunga.
What are you gonna do about it?
Your son, Alakay, he said he could fix it.
He's gone upriver.
- Off the reserve?
!
- No!
I tried to stop him.
I told him it was suicide.
He was determined to prove himself to you.
You stay here, in case he comes back!
Hurry, Zuba!
I'm so parched.
Is this place starting to freak you out?
We'll slip in, find the problem.
Hunters will never know we were here.
Why are we doing this?
Maybe my dad will think I'm...
I want to show him I'm a real lion.
As opposed to a chocolate lion.
I know this may sound hard to believe, but apparently, lions don't dance.
What?
!
As far as my dad is concerned.
As far as people are concerned, you're a hit.
In New York.
This is Africa...
much tougher crowd.
Marty, this is it!
This is the clog!
Come on.
Well, there's the water.
Stay down.
Look at that.
Knit one, purl two.
It's her.
- Is this right?
- Very good.
Nana, slow down.
You're a little tangled, aren't you?
No, don't pull.
I'll do it.
We need dynamite.
Got any?
Oh, snap!
I just used my last stick this morning!
- Savages!
- Evasive maneuvers!
- Serpentine, serpentine!
- Squiggly squid maneuver!
Zag, zig-zag, zig ziggy zag!
No, no!
Squiggly squid!
Etch A Sketch!
That's too complex!
Octopus, octopus!
- Run, Marty!
- I can't leave you here!
Go get help!
Squiggly squid maneuver!
Go!
Go!
Squiggly squid!
Etch A Sketch!
Etch A Sketch!
Save us We love you
OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- Save us
- Melman
- We love you
- Melman
Save us
OK, here we go.
OK, OK.
- Melman
- We love you
- Melman
- Save us
Here we go!
Here we go!
- What's all the hoopla about?
- Joe?
Joe the Witch Doctor?
We thought you were dead!
So did I. Then I realized I'm covered in brown spots.
So Melman's not dying!
- Melman's not dying!
- Oh, no!
Melman!
Move!
Don't do this!
Julien, stop this!
This is crazy!
Oh, suddenly throwing a giraffe into a volcano to make water is crazy!
Yes!
- Please, Melman!
Stop!
- Gloria?
- You can't do this!
- Why not?
Because...
You can't do this, Melman.
First, that hurts.
Second, I've only got 18 hours to live, anyway.
Melman, I gotta know did you mean those things you said about me?
Of course I did.
- That's crazy.
- It is?
It's crazy to think I had to go halfway around the world to find out the perfect guy for me lived right next door.
Then it's you and me, neighbor.
You and me for the next 18 hours.
I'll take whatever you got.
- Maurice, what happened?
- I believe the fat lady has sung.
- What's going on here?
- Marty!
Alex is in big trouble!
We got to get upriver fast!
- What about the plane?
- Perfect!
Come on!
The plane won't be fixed until the suits meet our demands.
Now, maternity leave.
Maternity leave?
You're all males.
We need that plane for a rescue mission.
There's nothing I can do until we bust up this union.
I'll bust up all of you if you don't get this plane going.
Can't you see these commies have my hands tied?
No maternity leave.
Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want these blowing around on the savanna.
All right.
You get your maternity leave.
Finally.
Where we headed?
What's going on?
Where are we going?
Oh, no!
Please!
Don't put me there!
No!
This is wrong.
You see?
You are survivors.
Now, how about a nice lion casserole?
You can't eat a lion.
Don't worry, it tastes like chicken.
No, no, no.
Don't listen to her.
She's out of her mind, people!
I'm from New York City!
It's me, Alex the lion!
From Central Park!
Dad!
What were you thinking, son?
You got no business being out here!
Stay behind me.
They're New Yorkers.
They're just rude and frightened people.
Stay back!
You'd let your dinner get away?
- What are you doing?
- The only thing I know how to do.
What the heck?
Hey, I know those moves.
Alex?
- It's Alex the lion!
- From Central Park!
It is Alex!
Only one lion can move like that!
He's beautiful.
I can't believe it.
How does he do that?
What are you doing?
I'm dancing with my son!
I think.
Don't think, Dad.
Feel!
Butterfly!
I'm feeling it!
I'm feeling it!
Roar!
That was beautiful.
Now let's eat!
Dad, look out!
What the...
Alex!
Get in!
She's got a gun!
Get out while we can!
- What?
- She's got a gun!
Get out while we can!
Pass it on!
He said let's have some fun and take out the dam.
Basset hound.
Skipper!
Alex wants to take out the dam.
All right!
But it's his funeral.
- Hard to port!
- Aye-aye, Skippy!
Bring it on!
Bring it on!
Come back!
That's my dinner!
Kowalski, full throttle.
Music!
- I like this song.
- It never gets old.
It does have a catchy hook.
Come about!
Bring her in low!
Hold onto your skirts!
It's dam-busting time!
Hold on tight, baby!
Here we go!
Tell them no!
Pull up!
They'll kill us!
There's got to be another way!
Pass it on!
They say no pull up.
Kill us.
There's no other way.
Basset hound.
Are you sure?
Men, there is no sacrifice greater than someone else's.
No!
Medic!
Ramming speed!
Bring it on!
Bad kitties.
I don't know why the sacrifice didn't work.
The science seemed so solid.
I'd jump right in that volcano if I wasn't so good at whistling.
It's you!
I found you!
Mort?
Bad fishy!
I wonder if the gods like seafood.
Let's find out.
Look, Maurice.
- That was quick.
- I did it!
I did it!
I did it!
OK, you did it!
Oh, yes!
Look!
- It's Alakay!
- It's Zuba!
You did it!
Alakay, Zuba, you did it!
Zuba!
Alakay!
You're back!
I'm so glad you're safe!
Out of my way.
Well, well, well.
You know, Zuba, if I remember correctly, you quit the pride.
And you were kicked out.
So don't think that this changes anything.
You're right.
In fact, we humbly present you with this token of appreciation.
A man bag.
Very popular where I'm from.
- Don't know what to say.
- Still be tough and carry your stuff.
Does the strap adjust?
This will go very nicely for me when I go out hiking.
But you're still banished.
We figured you'd say that.
My handbag!
You bad kitty!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
You deserve this, son.
Welcome to the pride.
Thanks, Dad.
But this belongs to you.
No, son.
To us!
My son!
The King of New York!
That's my baby!
Love transcends all differences.
We are gathered here today to celebrate such a love.
Do you take each other, for better or for worse?
For better, please.
What a beautiful, weird couple!
That's not going to last.
Can I kiss the bride?
No!
Music!
- Struts.
- Check.
- Flaps!
- Check.
- Diamonds and gold.
- Check.
- Bye-bye!
- We'll miss you!
See you later!
We'll be back after the honeymoon in Monte Carlo, or whenever the gold runs out.
Come back soon!
Mom, let them take their time.
New York isn't going anywhere, right, guys?
You're right about that!
As long as I'm with her and you two, I don't care where we are.
She has the most amazing laugh.
Love has no boundaries!
Looks like you're stuck with us for a while.
Dad?
What's wrong?
I just thought we could hang out a bit and...
- You got me!
- I got you, son!
You got me with my thing.
You brought it back around on me.
I got you, son!
The old man's not too bad, eh, Marty?
- Marty?
Who's Marty?
- Come on.
- I don't know no Marty.
- You can't fool me.
Ain't no Marty here.
Marty!
I can look into your eyes, and I know it's you.
See, I've been traveling Been traveling forever
But now that I found a home feels like I'm in heaven
See, I've been traveling Been traveling forever
But now that I'm home
Hey!
Shake the hot things!
Shake the hot things!
Shake 'em!
Shake 'em!
Shake 'em!
Well done, boys.
Looks like ice-cold sushi for breakfast.
No, no, son.
Over here.
See the lion?
Look at the lion and get the lion.
Now, son, if you're gonna grow up and be like your daddy someday, you gotta learn how to fight.
Da-da.
Now, Alakay, let me show you something, OK?
You see this mark?
You and me are the same.
When you're bigger, you'll be Alpha Lion, just like me.
Now let me see you fight.
Ready?
No, Alakay.
No dancing!
You just amuse yourself, don't you?
You're a strange kid.
You're a strange one.
I'm...
Now, come on, let's try it again.
No, Alakay.
Stop that right now.
Doggone it!
It's so disappointing when they don't grow up the way you want.
Makunga.
You're not challenging me again, are you?
Look on the bright side.
After I defeat you and become alpha lion, you'll have more time to spend with your pathetic son.
Before I kick your butt, let me ask you:
Why do you want to become the alpha lion?
I'm better looking, I have better hair, I'm deceivingly smart and I want everyone else to do what I say.
We fight on three.
One...
Pay attention, Alakay.
Daddy will show you how it's done.
Two, three!
- Who's the alpha lion?
- You are.
Don't you forget it.
And that, Alakay, is how you attack...
Alakay?
That's it.
Here, kitty, kitty.
This one's a beauty.
He'll be worth a few bucks.
Itjust gets easier and easier.
Daddy!
Alakay!
Alakay!
Alakay!
Da-da!
No!
No!
No!
Alakay!
- Daddy!
- Daddy's got you!
Hold on!
Da-da!
Alakay!
Daddy!
I've been around the world in the pouring rain
Feeling out of place and feeling strange
Take me to a place where they know my name
'Cause I ain't met nobody that looks the same
I'm a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle
He's a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle
I'm a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle
He's a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle
I need my peoples, my peoples Take me to my peoples
Play thatjungle fever Show 'em some love
Show love
Just gotta have someone Gotta have someone
To relate to, to relate to
I'm feeling right at home
Feeling right at home Feeling right at home
Feeling right at home I'm feeling right at home
See I been traveling Been traveling forever...
- I don't like the looks of this guy.
- He's kind of cute.
He's kind of a showoff.
You think he's cute?
Roar!
The King of New York City Alex the Lion!
I still think he's kind of a showoff.
The guy's an animal.
Maybe he should take a break.
You know, we could all use a vacation.
Come on, where would we go on vacation?
I don't know about you, but I want to go to Connecticut!
On the loose, several animals, including the world famous Alex the Lion, escaped from the Central Park Zoo tonight.
The escapees were cornered in Grand Central Station.
He was a very bad kitty.
Animal rights activists, who convinced zoo officials to have the animals sent to Africa, were stunned to learn that the freighter carrying the animals was reported missing today.
Tonight, hundreds of New Yorkers have gathered at the zoo to mourn the loss of their beloved zoo animals.
The question on everyone's mind, where are they now?
I like to move it, move it
He likes to move it, move it
She likes to move it, move it
- We like to
- Move it!
Come on!
Y'all know this one!
It never gets stale!
- We like to
- Move it!
We'll miss you little fuzz buckets!
You've been a great crowd!
Glad we could introduce you to the toilet.
If you ever come look us up in Manhattan, feel free to call first.
Seriously though, call.
OK?
Settle down, everybody.
Be quiet!
You can't leave without this!
Surprise, freaks!
Shake it!
Shake it.
Look, I'm a lady!
I'm a lady, everyone!
I'm a lady!
Not really!
It's me, King Julien!
Which of you is attracted to me?
Hands up!
Hey, freaks!
You will be very glad to hear that I am coming with you.
Oh, no, thank you.
Yes, thank you.
It's my plane!
Until I return with the spoils from the new country Stevie will be in charge!
I don't think they like that idea.
What are you saying, Stevie?
No.
Could we...?
No, you didn't say that!
How is that even possible?
Naughty little thing!
Stevie says...
Let them eat cake!
King Julien, wait for me!
I'm all packed!
I have a whole itinerary planned!
Oh, no!
It's Mort!
He's so annoying!
Don't let him on.
Stop that thing!
He's carrying scissors and hand cream!
Everybody in!
Quickly, get in, get in!
Get in quick!
- Struts.
- Check.
- Flaps.
- Check.
- Engine.
Coffee maker.
- Check.
You guys!
Copsie-daisy!
That has to be the second biggest slingshot I've ever seen.
But it'll have to do.
Attention.
This is your captain speaking.
In the event of an emergency, place the vest over your head then kiss your... good-bye.
New York City, here we come!
Pray to your personal God this hunk ofjunk flies.
Personal God, hunk...?
What?
We are go, sir.
Open the door!
I'm outside!
If cabin pressure is lost, place the mask over your face to hide your terrified expression.
Miss, aren't these supposed to be attached to my seat?
- No, sir.
- OK, boys, launch!
Launch!
- Launch!
- Launch!
Gremlin!
Hey, Mort.
Hi!
That was weird.
- Somebody's dreaming.
- I think I saw Mort on the plane wing.
You got Madagascar on the brain.
I know I'm gonna miss it.
It was incredible.
I think it'll seem more fun the further we are from it.
Like when you bit me on the butt?
I'm gonna take that thing you're holding onto and use it onstage.
It's all part of my little actor's salad bar of emotional tidbits.
Are the butts next to the croutons?
You don't need to be sarcastic.
When we get back, I might sign up for the breeding program.
Breeding program?
We reach a point when we want to meet somebody.
Settle down, have a relationship.
I can see that.
What?
Like dating?
Yeah, dating.
Other... other guys?
What do you mean, other guys?
Darn it!
What is holding up that beverage service?
!
I'm gonna go check.
You all keep talking.
I'm gonna catch a few winks.
It's so funny!
I like laughing!
It's such a nice experience!
To laugh!
Do you mind going back?
This is first class.
It's nothing personal.
We're just better than you.
Maurice, I'm open!
Hit me!
- He shoots, he scores!
- Is that Vivaldi?
- In-flight slave.
- Can I help you, Mr. Mankiewicz?
Bring my nuts on a silver platter.
We were checking on our drink order.
Sorry.
Been a little backed up.
- I guess I'll go back...
- Where's your body?
You're freaking me out!
Can you please go over there, please?
What happened to the separation of the classes?
I'm sure this democracy thing is just a fad.
We'll go out for pineapple, my bobbly-headed boobily-boo.
Skipper, look.
Analysis.
Looks like a small bulb used to indicate something unusual, like a malfunction.
I find it pretty and somewhat hypnotic.
That too, sir.
Right!
Rico?
Manual!
Problemo solved.
- We may be out of fuel.
- Why do you think so?
We've lost engine one and engine two is no longer on fire.
Buckle up, boys.
Don't look, doll.
This might get hairy.
Attention!
This is your captain.
I have good and bad news.
The good news is, we're landing immediately.
The bad news is, we're crash-landing.
When it comes to air travel, we know you have no choice.
But thanks for choosing Air Penguin.
Raise your arms, Maurice!
It's more fun when you raise your arms!
I can fly!
This could be it, Marty!
I want you to know you are a one-in-a-million friend!
Thanks, buddy!
You're the best ever!
- And you won't mind when I tell you...
- Tell me anything!
I broke your iPod!
The buttons were so small!
It made me mad!
- The horror!
- I'm sorry!
- I'll kill you, butt-biter!
- It was an accident!
- An accident!
- Butt-biter!
I love you, Gloria!
I always have!
Like you love the beach.
Or a good book.
Or the beach.
Goodness, doll, you're shaking like a leaf.
Rico, you've had your fun.
Pull up.
Gear down.
Gently.
You just want to kiss the ground.
Just a peck, a smooch, like you'd kiss your sister.
I said, kiss it!
Now just a little brake.
Just a touch.
I believe that's checkmate.
Commence emergency landing procedure.
Flaps up!
Deploy!
Oh, we're here.
What in the world?
What happened to the plane?
What did y'all do to the plane?
I'm OK.
I'm alive.
I can't even sleep for a minute.
This is not JFK.
Kowalski, casualty report.
Two passengers unaccounted for.
That's a number I can live with.
Good landing, boys.
Who says a penguin can't fly?
Hey, happy slappers!
Is there some reason to celebrate?
Look at the plane!
- We'll fix it.
- How are you gonna fix this?
Grit, spit and a whole lot of duct tape.
We should be up and running in, say, six to nine months.
- Sixty-nine months?
!
- No, six to nine months.
Kowalski, I say we use this setback to our advantage.
- Where'd you get that number?
- I want you to reconfigure the design.
How do you estimate that?
Pretty boy!
Why don't you and your friends dig a latrine.
Hold on.
Who made you king of the plane wreck?
Excuse me?
Fine.
You can be in charge.
You fix the plane.
Who gives you the authority to put me in charge?
OK, then I'll remain in charge.
Yeah, you will remain in charge.
You and your hippie friends stay out of our hair.
Correcto-mundo.
Because I decided to.
- Good for you.
- Well, this discussion isn't over.
Higher mammals!
Stay with us.
We could use your front cortexes and opposable thumbs.
Phil!
I should wash your hands out with soap.
How in the hell-o will they fix this plane?
!
You know, grit and spit and spit.
A lot of spit and grit and stick-to-it-iveness.
That don't sound too promising.
You're right.
We're stuck here.
As long as we're together, we'll be OK.
Yeah, but love ain't gonna get us home.
Behold!
The lion!
- People!
- There is much to see.
Moving on.
Wait, wait, wait!
People!
- They'll help us!
- Wait up!
- People!
Stop!
- Help us!
If you stop, I'll autograph those!
I know you!
You.
It's the bad kitty.
How do you like some of that?
!
Come in, Tokyo!
Right in the batteries.
You think an old lady can't take care of herself?
Next time, I won't go so easy on you!
Thank you, dear.
Moving on!
Are you out of your mind?
We need help and you harass old ladies?
!
Out of my mind?
Who's out of my mind now?
- See if you can get an operator.
- No problem.
Out of my mind.
We're going home.
Message E-4.
The service user has roamed outside the coverage area.
Please try again later.
Am I trippin'?
All those zebras...
like me.
- Where are we?
- San Diego.
This time I'm 40 percent sure.
- I know this place.
- I think it's Africa.
Africa?
It's got to be.
Our ancestral crib.
It's in our blood.
I can feel it!
No, it's more than that.
It's like déjà vu, like I've been here before.
It's like Roots!
No, it's like déjà vu, like I've been here before.
How!
How!
Me Alex!
Me and me friends fly, fly in great metal bird.
Then plummet!
Smash ground!
Go boom!
Then here we emerge.
We offer only happiness and good greetings.
Is he dancing about a plane crash?
Yeah.
We just... yeah.
I thought...
Sorry.
You came from off the reserve?
Way off.
From the Central Park Zoo, actually.
Don't strain yourself.
What's going on here?
They say they're from off the reserve.
That's impossible.
Only people come from off the reserve.
You look familiar.
Do I know you?
How could you survive the hunters?
We didn't see any hunters.
- What are you looking at?
- Me?
Nothing.
This watering hole doesn't need any more mouths to feed.
So skedaddle back to where you came from.
Is there a manager we could talk to?
I see.
You're here to challenge me!
What?
No!
No.
That's what it looks like to me!
Zuba!
Wait.
I'm trying to take care of business...
Yeah, yeah, Zuba.
Hold on.
Alakay?
Is that you?
No, it's Alex. lx.
Like New York Knicks.
Zuba, look!
I've always had that.
The vet checked it out.
It's kind of a beauty spot, really.
A mark.
All right, this is a little weird.
Honey, he's come home.
What?
You've come home.
Son.
Dad.
Mom and Dad?
Mom and Dad!
Mom and Dad!
It's my mom and dad!
I got a mom and dad!
My baby's alive!
Dad!
My son!
My son is home!
Alakay!
Alakay has come home!
Alakay!
Yeah!
The prodigal son returns.
This is perfect!
I thought you hated Zuba.
No, I do.
I do.
I do.
I hate him.
Oh, I do.
And I'm going to use Alakay, yes.
I'm going to use him to get rid of Zuba once and for all!
Giddy-up, feathered horse!
Make way!
Move out of the way!
Stand aside!
New York!
It's a bit of a dump.
Are you sure we're not in New Jersey?
Hello, New Yorkers!
Your new king is here!
This calls for a celebration!
Maurice, I think they like me.
You've got to love a non-hostile takeover!
Chukka-chukka what?
Excuse me.
I'm Marty.
I'm kind of new around here.
Hey, Marty!
You're a good-looking group!
You like to run?
Yeah.
Running is crack-a-lackin'.
That's right!
Crack-a-lackin'.
You guys speak my crack-a-lackin' language.
What?
You don't have doctors here?
Not anymore.
Well, what if you catch a cold?
We go over to the dying holes and we die.
You guys really need a doctor.
- We have an opening.
- Would you be interested?
Me?
A doctor?
It's raining men.
Hallelujah!
You all got it going on.
Why don't you have a man?
You got worms?
Oh, I got rid of those.
Listen, girls.
Manhattan is short on two things, parking and hippos.
Hey, everybody!
I just found out that my son is a doggone king!
The King of New York!
Show me some of your moves, son.
Don't be bashful.
All right.
This one always knocks 'em dead.
Roar!
Look out.
The King is mad.
The King is mad!
Let's welcome him back into the pride with open arms!
Welcome to the herd, Marty!
Me?
I've always wanted to be part of a herd!
- It's one for all...
- [all] And all for all, y'all!
How do I look?
Technically, a traditional witch doctor has a bone through his nose.
Don't worry... it's just a clip-on.
Voilà!
He's a witch doctor!
My mother will be so happy.
Look out!
I think Moto Moto likes you.
Here he comes.
I like 'em big
I like 'em chunky
I like 'em big I like 'em plumpy
I like 'em round With something' somethin'
They like my sound They think I'm funky
Goodness, girl... you huge.
Who's your friend?
Or is that your butt?
You as quick as you are hefty.
So you're Moto Moto?
The name's so nice, you say it twice.
I kind of like it, fatso.
I'll see you around, girl.
It won't be hard, because you so... plumpy.
Cops!
I hate to be a party pooper, Zuba, but some of the lions were wondering when you plan to banish your son.
- What are you talking about?
- It's nothing, really.
They're griping that Alakay never went through the rite of passage, blah, blah, blah, so technically speaking, he can't be a member of the pride.
It's nonsense.
I forgot about the rite of passage.
What is it?
What's this rite of passage?
A traditional coming-of-age ceremony.
Young lions earn their manes by demonstrating their skills.
- A show-of-skill talent show deal?
- Yeah.
Strutting their stuff.
A performance!
I think that's up my alley.
If it's tradition, I want to do it.
Strut my stuff.
Earn my mane.
I want to be Alaki.
- Alakay.
- Alakay!
Even better.
We will hold the rite of passage in the morning!
That's wonderful!
Good luck, Alakay.
Where I'm from, we say, "Break a leg."
That's my boy!
I'm a private dancer
A dancer for money
Any old music will do
Beautiful, isn't it?
It's amazing.
Guys this is where we belong.
Operation Tourist Trap is a go.
Oh, I like that one.
It works on many levels.
You guys are a bunch of suck-ups.
- That, too.
- Absolutely.
Stations.
Stage one.
Go!
Oh, no!
What have I done?
Come on, take the bait.
- What happened?
- Oh, look at the poor little guy.
Is it dead?
Stage two!
Go, go, go!
I will give him the kiss of life.
Rico!
Rico!
Reverse!
Gas!
Music!
No!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Come back!
What is all this rock'n'roll racket?
!
Is she dead?
No!
You hoodlums!
Good heavens!
Are you OK?
Lady, I found your pocketbook.
My handbag.
Such a good boy.
Nana can't survive without it.
You are one tough cookie.
Brownies Troop 416, Yonkers.
OK, nobody panic!
The best thing we can do is stay together.
We'll wait for another tourjeep.
It may take hours, but...
Where are you going?
I'm not staying here to be attacked by more animals!
I'm too old to die.
I'm going with her.
Old lady, wait up!
Please!
We need to stay together.
Fine!
We'll go that way!
Does anyone want a hard candy?
- Easy now.
- Watch your step.
And right here...
OK, are you ready?
This is where you always slept.
Oh, man!
- Was this mine?
- Look at you.
Look at him.
Oh, this thing.
Look, look!
- I remember this!
- He remembers.
A little harder than...
You never slept on the right end.
You always slept on the bottom end.
Is that...?
Is that my...?
Is that me?
You had the cutest little paws.
Little, little bitty ol' paws.
You did that the day we lost you.
Wow.
I was so young.
What happened to me?
It was all my fault.
I turned my back and...
It was not your fault.
Your father did everything he could.
He tracked those hunters for weeks.
Far off the reserve.
Finally, I had to assume the hunters well...
We thought they'd killed you.
But my son fought them off!
Don't mess with the King of New York!
- That's right!
- Keep your chin in.
You boys be careful!
Watch out before you break something.
You used to call this "foofie."
"Foofie"?
Foofie.
He doesn't want that.
This is my foofie!
Zuba, you better give him his foofie.
I mean, no, thank you, thank you.
It's perfect.
Son, you get your rest.
You have a big day tomorrow.
You'll need all your strength.
I will bring the house down for you.
I hope so.
Otherwise, your father will have to banish you.
Jeez, Mom, really?
I know you'll do us proud.
You know why?
You were born with it.
Good night, Alakay.
My boy.
My own boy.
My son's a king.
My son's a king.
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Alakay.
Foofie.
Look at foofie!
My foofie!
Foofie, foofie, foofie.
My foofie!
No sign of civilization.
Everybody appears very tired.
I think we're lost.
Nana, do you know where you're going?
No, but I'm going with a skip in my step and a smile on my face.
Sure, right, OK.
Yeah, all right.
- It's people.
- How did you get here?
- Can you help us?
We're lost.
- We're lost too.
It was awful.
A flash of black and white and they were gone.
They took the jeep!
- That happened to ourjeep too!
- What do we do?
How will we all survive?
No food, no water, no shelter.
What are we gonna do?
!
You can let nature get the best of you, or you can get the best of nature.
Gather 'round, children.
We're New Yorkers, right?
Yeah.
We survive the concrete jungle!
When we need food, we hunt for a decent hot dog stand.
- Am I right?
- She's right.
When we need shelter, we build skyscrapers.
- Exactly!
- When we need water, we build a dam.
We're New Yorkers, for crying out loud!
If we can make it there, we can make it anywhere!
I'm coming, King Julien!
Bad fishy!
Bad fishy!
No, shark, no!
Sit!
Why am I laughing?
We have all the parts we need, but we're slightly behind schedule.
- How slightly?
- Six to nine years.
- Sixty-nine years?
- No, six to nine years.
Private!
What happened to our thumbs?
Haven't seen them since yesterday.
Darn you, Darwin!
Nobody goes AWOL on my watch.
Private!
You're coming with me.
Rico!
You're coming with me!
- We'll bring them in for court martial.
- That won't be necessary!
We've recruited a few extra thumbs for you, Skipper.
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.
Oh, I doubt that.
Enough lollygagging.
Let's get to work.
There'll be three groups.
Group Alpha will do sheet metal fabrication.
Group Bronson handles assembly.
Group George Peppard, craft services.
Any questions?
Good!
Let's get to work.
I'd like to kiss you, monkey man.
All right, but you're so darn ugly.
Remember, little cub scouts, a great dance performance comes from the heart.
Straight from the heart, you'll never go wrong.
Sure, mister.
Hey, Alakay, I just happened to walk by, I thought I'd wish you luck.
- You're not nervous, are you?
- Nah, it's my thing.
In my opinion, the key to this is choosing the right competitor.
You mean, this is like a dance battle sort of thing?
- Like a dance-off?
- Sure.
Great.
I love that.
Freestyle.
Who'd be a good match for me?
Just to keep things interesting.
Well, I wish I could help, but that's strictly against our ancient tradition and all we hold sacred.
But if it was me out there...
I'd choose Teetsi.
Teetsi.
OK.
Sounds interesting.
Makunga, right?
Thank you.
Anything for Zuba's boy.
Go get 'em, tiger.
Shake it out.
A five, six, seven, eight.
Let's go, let's do this.
Let us begin the rite of passage ceremony.
- Come on, baby!
Make Mama proud!
- Woman, I'm trying to take...
On it, Mom!
Who will be the first participant?
Me!
Oh!
Me, me, me!
Me!
Me!
Me!
Me, me!
Please, me?
How about you?
The tall, handsome one.
Yeah.
Choose your opponent.
Let me see.
I guess I'll pick Teetsi?
Teetsi?
Why did he pick Teetsi?
That's my boy!
He's got some gumption there!
Somebody, wake him up!
All right, so, Teetsi, come on.
Let's do this, huh?
Come on, little tsetse fly.
Let's see your stuff.
Bring it.
- Let's dance!
- OK.
But let me warn you that I am a protégé of Fosse and Robbins!
Not "dance" dance!
Fight!
Dance fight!
You got it.
- Is he dancing?
- What's he doing?
I know that boy is not dancing.
This is even better than I thought.
Alakay, turn around!
No, Pop, it's hop, shuffle, ball change, hip swish, turn around.
Oh, no.
Alakay!
Are you hurt?
Yeah, I am.
Did I... did I win?
No, son.
How could this happen?
You told us you were a king.
A king does not get beat.
I am a king.
I'm the King of New York.
It's my stage name.
Like for when I perform.
Perform?
Oh, no, this is horrible!
Alakay has failed the test!
Who would have ever imagined that today Zuba would have to banish his own son?
Zuba, no.
Zuba, yes.
Sadly, the alpha lion must cast out all failures.
Then I'm no longer the alpha lion.
Dad, what are you doing?
Dad, no!
You can't do this.
Who could possibly take Zuba's place?
Anyone?
Someone?
No one?
You, sir!
I guess not.
Well, I... this is all very awkward, but I suppose I could carry this tremendous burden.
Teetsi!
Get the hat.
As your new leader, I hereby banish Alakay!
He shall wear this Hat of Shame and leave the watering hole for a thousand years, or life!
Whichever comes last.
Shoo, shoo!
Get out of here!
You should have told us you weren't a real king, son!
You never told me I'd have to fight anybody!
What did you expect?
!
I don't know!
Maybe a little fatherly advice like, "Hey, son, it's a fight!"
- You're a lion!
- But I never fought another lion!
No, I guess not.
You dance!
And other stuff!
Your pal, Makunga, set me up back there!
- None of this would have happened...
- If you were a real lion.
- Zuba!
- Yeah, I said it!
A real lion.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Saw.
Suture.
Swab.
You're in my light, Stephen.
You have a brown spot on your shoulder.
That's very observant, Stephen.
As you can see, I'm covered in brown spots.
OK!
That bone will be good as new in a few weeks.
So I don't have to pick out a dying hole?
No, you got your whole life ahead of you.
- Really?
- Go out and grab it by the horns.
- Thank you, Dr. Mankiewicz!
- Break a leg!
Sweet kid.
This spot looks like Witch Doctor's Disease.
Witch Doctor's Disease?
That's the most ridiculous disease I've ever heard of.
- Don't ask.
- Someone's been knotty.
This won't hurt a bit.
Joe, our last witch doctor, had a spotjust like that.
- And?
- Monday, Joe.
Wednesday, no Joe.
Wednesday, no Joe?
I can breathe!
Thanks, doc!
So this Witch Doctor's Disease is a real thing?
You'll find a cure.
You've got at least 48 hours!
But I've never heard of it.
I mean...
I don't have any penicillin.
I'll need a CAT scan just to get started!
Have a lion look you over.
They'd be happy to.
Ta-da!
- He has talent.
- Stupendous and tremendous.
Hollah!
Bet you've never seen that one!
Knocked 'em dead in New York!
- Let's all give it a try!
- Let's do it!
Well, you can try all you want to, but it takes years of practice.
You'll never get a tight stream until you build up your lip muscles to the point where you can purse your lips like this.
You got it?
Ta-da!
How did you...?
You guys got it right out of the box!
- If you can do it...
...we can do it.
It's in our blood!
I always thought I was a bit unique.
We are unique!
We are like a force of nature!
- A million points of light!
- And dark stripes!
Exactly the same!
Exactly the same.
Looks impressive, Kowalski, but will it fly?
Yes.
If we fold it here, here and here.
Nice.
Oh, man.
My dad thinks I'm a total loser.
I've ruined my parents' lives.
That is definitely not crack-a-lackin'.
It is lacking' in the cracking', my friend.
I've gotta fix this.
So there's...
There's something I gotta tell you.
Hey, guys.
Is this place great or what?
!
I'd go with "or what."
Well, I'll tell you what.
You're not gonna believe it, but I got a date with Moto Moto.
Who's Moto Moto?
Oh, he's so big and handsome and big!
- Know what "Moto Moto" means?
- Twins?
It means, "Hot Hot."
"Hot Hot"?
When did you start parlez-ing African?
It's in my blood.
Don't worry, you can flirt around with Mr. Hot Pants after I'm gone.
Melman, why am I the parade and you're the rain?
Why are you driving your parade under my rain?
Maybe I'll parade in another part of town!
Whoa, guys.
Main Street's mine!
Well, you can have it!
And you can take your hotee-tot float and Mr. Hotee Moto Moto...
- What are you talking about?
- What are we talking about?
Melman, just tell her.
What?
What are you...
I don't know what you're talking about.
I guess I'll go, then.
Don't bother.
- Don't get up on my account.
- Melman!
Gloria!
- I thought you guys were friends!
- Marty's absolutely right.
- Marty?
- Marty?
Marty?
What the heck is going on?
You're not...?
Oh!
He was...
I thought he...
You're not him.
He's...
Oh.
You thought that guy was me?
No.
I mean, yes, you...
Guys, come on.
You thought I was him?
You guys kind of do look a little...
You look a lot alike.
Marty, you look a lot alike.
You laugh alike.
Talk alike.
He has the same speech pattern.
It's a little weird, really.
I mean, come on.
Marty.
So you're saying there's nothing unique about me.
I'm just like any other zebra.
No.
Of course you're different!
How?
OK, I can't tell you apart.
Maybe you could wear a bell or something.
- A bell?
!
- OK, not a bell.
Bell's a bad idea.
How about a T-shirt that says, "I'm with stupid"?
- I'm not stupid!
- Not you, stupid!
Him, stupid!
You know, while you've been doing the prancing pony with your new posse,
I've been having the worst day of my life.
It's always about you, isn't it?
My problems are just a little bit bigger than yours.
I couldn't tell you apart.
So what?
!
Yeah, fine.
Run away, Marty!
Run away!
That's what you do best!
Just like back in New York!
I'm right here.
But you can't tell that, right?
Your one-of-a-million friend hopes you enjoy your bigger-than-anyone-else's problems alone!
Good, leave!
I don't need you to help me solve my problems!
You're a dime a dozen!
I can't tell which one's Marty!
Which one's Marty?
Wait a minute.
Oh, yeah, I don't care!
Nice hat, you showoff!
Marty don't go.
Giddy-up, giddy-up!
Giddy-up, giddy-up!
Look, Maurice!
The perfect spot for my summer palace!
Please fill in all these holes and relocate the riff-raff.
- Who'd leave a perfectly good head?
- What a waste.
Tell me about it.
I'm in my prime here.
I'm terminal, you know?
I probably only have another two days left to live.
That's a bummer, man.
If I, King Julien... that's my name only had two days left to live,
I would do all the things
- I've ever dreamed of doing.
- Like what?
I'd love to become a professional whistler.
I'm pretty amazing at it now, but I want to get even better, make my living out of it.
You know what else I would do?
I would invade a neighboring country and impose my own ideology, even if they didn't want it!
Easy for you to say.
You're a king.
Yes.
And you are only just a sad little head.
There must be something you want to do before you die!
- There is this one thing.
- What?
Tell me.
- No, I couldn't.
- What is it?
I never told Gloria how I feel about her.
What is it?
Please tell me!
I never had the guts to tell Gloria how I feel about her.
How I've always felt about her.
Fine.
Don't tell me!
Is it a woman?
You didn't tell me it's a woman.
What are you afraid of?
You're a dead man anyway.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're right.
You've got to march right up to this woman.
Look her right in the eye.
Lean forward.
Just a little, or almost all the way.
Then you let her lean forward a little until you're just lips' distance away from each other.
Then you tell her how much you hate her.
Actually, it's more like love her.
Oh, you sly dog!
Woof, woof!
You're a real player.
Now listen to me.
You got to rise up.
You hearing me?
- He didn't hear you.
- I can't hear you!
- You got to rise up!
- Rising up!
- Get out of the hole!
- I'm rising out of the ground!
- He's rising, Maurice.
- I'm rising, Maurice!
- Rising!
- You go right up to this woman!
Do you feel it?
- Go up to her face!
- Tell the truth!
- I'm going to tell her!
- Then you say, "Baby, I dig you!"
Yeah!
I'm going to do it!
I'm going to do it!
I love that happy little head.
She love
Moto Moto
She love
Moto Moto
She loves me She loves my eyes
She loves me She loves my thighs
She loves my roundness
She love that I'm chunky She love that I'm plumpy
She love my heftiness She love my zestiness
She love me restlessly She love me forever
She love me 'cause she love me
Moto Moto before things get too serious, well,
I was wondering, if I were to, for example, stay here I'd like to ask you...
Let your candied lips be the messengers to my... ear canal.
I have so many questions.
I promise the answer will always be yes.
Unless no is required.
So what is it about me that you find so interesting?
You're the most plumpenest girl I've ever met.
OK.
Other than that.
Let's see.
Yeah, well, you know... you chunky.
Right.
My gosh, girl, you huge.
You said that.
Yeah, that's right.
We don't have to talk no more.
Gloria!
Gloria.
Melman.
Melman, I want you to meet Moto Moto.
Moto Moto.
Yeah, nice to meet you.
- I guess I...
- It's OK, Melman.
Apology accepted.
Oh.
Yeah, right, that.
That's why I...
Good.
OK.
Well, that's it, then.
Good.
We're kind of busy here, man.
No.
No, that's not it.
Listen, Mototo, you better treat this lady like a queen.
Because you, my friend, you found yourself the perfect woman.
If I was ever so lucky to find the perfect woman,
I'd give her flowers every day.
And notjust any flowers.
OK?
Her favorites are orchids.
White.
And breakfast in bed.
Six loaves of wheat toast, butter on both sides.
No crust, the way she likes it.
I'd be her shoulder to cry on and her best friend.
I'd spend every day thinking of how to make her laugh.
She has the most amazing laugh.
That's what I would do if I were you.
But I'm not, so you do it.
OK.
What?
That was beautiful.
Anyways, where were we?
I'm "huge"?
Surprised to see me, Makunga?
Well, I'm here to set things straight, like a real lion!
Is this real enough for you?
How about this?
This is for setting me up!
This is for stealing my dad's job!
This is for humiliating my family!
And making me look like a fool!
Had enough?
Sure, fly away!
Coward.
The water.
It's gone.
It's never gone dry before.
- We'll need a lot more dying holes.
- How could this happen?
Out of my way!
What is going on here?
!
The watering hole is dry!
There's barely water for one of us!
- Good observation, Shirley.
- I'm Bobby.
Makunga, what do we do?
Quiet!
Listen up!
I'm afraid there is only one solution to this horrible crisis:
We'll all have to fight for it.
- We can't fight for it.
- That's crazy.
That's not fair.
You'd win!
Exactly, Shirley.
I'm Bob...
Sorry, folks, but life isn't fair.
I'm in charge now, thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion.
Please, Makunga, this is the only water on the reserve.
If you're thirsty, you'll have to look for water off the reserve.
- Off the reserve?
- It's too dangerous!
Hunters would shoot us!
No one leaves the reserve and survives!
I left the reserve!
And survived.
I can do something about this.
Looks like a clogged pipe, like we get in New York.
I'll travel upriver...
- Upriver?
- Off the reserve?
You?
Yeah.
I'll unclog the pipe and bring back your water.
Great!
I'd help you pack, but by the looks of that hat, I see you're all set!
Fine.
Go ahead, laugh.
Laugh your mane off.
I'll prove you wrong.
Maybe you should try a little rain dance.
Zuba would know what to do.
- Where's Zuba?
- You don't care about us.
Zuba should be in charge, not you.
All right, fine!
As an added measure, I will consult with Zuba!
Marty?
Hey!
Marty!
Marty?
Marty.
Where'd you get the fruity hat?
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
Hi.
Is Marty in there?
Anyone seen Marty?
Which one of us is Marty?
All right.
Well, if you see him, tell him his friend Alex came to say goodbye.
Goodbye?
Don't go.
Where are you going?
- Can we come?
- No.
I have to do this alone.
You can't leave the reserve!
What are you doing?
- They'll get your hat.
- Hunters are everywhere!
Could you leave the hat?
Marty!
I know you're in there.
Before I go, I got something I want to say.
You've been a great friend.
You've helped me so often to see the bright side of my problems that I never think of you having any.
I wasn't there for you when you needed me.
Just like back at the zoo.
What kind of friend does that make me?
A pretty lousy friend, I guess.
I just want you to know that I...
You're one in a million.
This is touching.
It is touching.
So could you turn around so I can tell you to your face?
That's right.
Gotcha!
I see you in there!
Yeah, you.
You, right there.
Twelfth row, two hundred and third from the left.
That's you, Marty.
I know it's you.
Know what makes you special?
These guys are white with black stripes.
You're black with white stripes.
You're a dreamer, Marty.
Always have been.
You have great taste in music and horrible taste in friends.
Well, not Melman and Gloria, but me.
OK, I'm in.
Marty, you can't come with me.
You don't have a choice.
- People are out there!
- You're crazy!
Come back!
The people will get you!
Don't lose the hat!
Bye, hat!
Any water?
No, just more diamonds and gold.
Don't give up hope.
Listen up!
I will help you!
There's only one way to get your precious water.
I, your beloved King Julien must simply make a small sacrifice to my good friends, the water gods, in the volcano!
What does that do?
What does that do?
Excellent question.
My sacrifice goes in the volcano.
The friendly gods eat up my sacrifice.
"Thank you for the sacrifice."
"Here, have another." "No, I've had enough."
"I'll be insulted unless you have another."
"I don't want another sacrifice!"
"Look at you!
You're skinny!" "No!
I've had enough!"
The gods eat the sacrifice.
They are grateful.
They give me some water, and then I give it to you.
What?
Does it work?
No!
I mean, yes.
Well, Maurice?
Ah, it's fifty-fifty.
We'll do it!
Excellent!
Now all I need is someone who would like to go into the volcano and get eaten by gods.
Any hands!
Hands, anybody!
I need someone, perhaps who has never found love, who could look death straight in the eyeball.
A real, genuine hero.
- I'll do it.
- Melman?
Hurry up!
Before we all come to our senses!
Melman, what is wrong with you?
I'm dying anyway.
If there's a chance it'll get you water, it's worth it.
Are you nuts?
I want you to know, back at the zoo, it was never the doctors or prescriptions that kept me going.
It was always you.
Seeing you every day.
That's what kept me going.
Melman!
Wait!
Melman!
Melman!
Melman!
You going to mope like this all day?
Don't "hmph" me.
Listen, Zuba.
A miracle happened.
Our son came back to us.
How come that is not good enough for you?
What are you saying, woman?
We lost him once, Zuba.
Let's not lose him again.
Zuba!
- Zuba!
- Get out of here!
What do you want?
It's awful.
The watering hole is dried up.
Dried up?
That's impossible!
There's nothing left!
You're alpha lion, Makunga.
What are you gonna do about it?
Your son, Alakay, he said he could fix it.
He's gone upriver.
- Off the reserve?
!
- No!
I tried to stop him.
I told him it was suicide.
He was determined to prove himself to you.
You stay here, in case he comes back!
Hurry, Zuba!
I'm so parched.
Is this place starting to freak you out?
We'll slip in, find the problem.
Hunters will never know we were here.
Why are we doing this?
Maybe my dad will think I'm...
I want to show him I'm a real lion.
As opposed to a chocolate lion.
I know this may sound hard to believe, but apparently, lions don't dance.
What?
!
As far as my dad is concerned.
As far as people are concerned, you're a hit.
In New York.
This is Africa...
much tougher crowd.
Marty, this is it!
This is the clog!
Come on.
Well, there's the water.
Stay down.
Look at that.
Knit one, purl two.
It's her.
- Is this right?
- Very good.
Nana, slow down.
You're a little tangled, aren't you?
No, don't pull.
I'll do it.
We need dynamite.
Got any?
Oh, snap!
I just used my last stick this morning!
- Savages!
- Evasive maneuvers!
- Serpentine, serpentine!
- Squiggly squid maneuver!
Zag, zig-zag, zig ziggy zag!
No, no!
Squiggly squid!
Etch A Sketch!
That's too complex!
Octopus, octopus!
- Run, Marty!
- I can't leave you here!
Go get help!
Squiggly squid maneuver!
Go!
Go!
Squiggly squid!
Etch A Sketch!
Etch A Sketch!
Save us We love you
OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- Save us
- Melman
- We love you
- Melman
Save us
OK, here we go.
OK, OK.
- Melman
- We love you
- Melman
- Save us
Here we go!
Here we go!
- What's all the hoopla about?
- Joe?
Joe the Witch Doctor?
We thought you were dead!
So did I. Then I realized I'm covered in brown spots.
So Melman's not dying!
- Melman's not dying!
- Oh, no!
Melman!
Move!
Don't do this!
Julien, stop this!
This is crazy!
Oh, suddenly throwing a giraffe into a volcano to make water is crazy!
Yes!
- Please, Melman!
Stop!
- Gloria?
- You can't do this!
- Why not?
Because...
You can't do this, Melman.
First, that hurts.
Second, I've only got 18 hours to live, anyway.
Melman, I gotta know did you mean those things you said about me?
Of course I did.
- That's crazy.
- It is?
It's crazy to think I had to go halfway around the world to find out the perfect guy for me lived right next door.
Then it's you and me, neighbor.
You and me for the next 18 hours.
I'll take whatever you got.
- Maurice, what happened?
- I believe the fat lady has sung.
- What's going on here?
- Marty!
Alex is in big trouble!
We got to get upriver fast!
- What about the plane?
- Perfect!
Come on!
The plane won't be fixed until the suits meet our demands.
Now, maternity leave.
Maternity leave?
You're all males.
We need that plane for a rescue mission.
There's nothing I can do until we bust up this union.
I'll bust up all of you if you don't get this plane going.
Can't you see these commies have my hands tied?
No maternity leave.
Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want these blowing around on the savanna.
All right.
You get your maternity leave.
Finally.
Where we headed?
What's going on?
Where are we going?
Oh, no!
Please!
Don't put me there!
No!
This is wrong.
You see?
You are survivors.
Now, how about a nice lion casserole?
You can't eat a lion.
Don't worry, it tastes like chicken.
No, no, no.
Don't listen to her.
She's out of her mind, people!
I'm from New York City!
It's me, Alex the lion!
From Central Park!
Dad!
What were you thinking, son?
You got no business being out here!
Stay behind me.
They're New Yorkers.
They're just rude and frightened people.
Stay back!
You'd let your dinner get away?
- What are you doing?
- The only thing I know how to do.
What the heck?
Hey, I know those moves.
Alex?
- It's Alex the lion!
- From Central Park!
It is Alex!
Only one lion can move like that!
He's beautiful.
I can't believe it.
How does he do that?
What are you doing?
I'm dancing with my son!
I think.
Don't think, Dad.
Feel!
Butterfly!
I'm feeling it!
I'm feeling it!
Roar!
That was beautiful.
Now let's eat!
Dad, look out!
What the...
Alex!
Get in!
She's got a gun!
Get out while we can!
- What?
- She's got a gun!
Get out while we can!
Pass it on!
He said let's have some fun and take out the dam.
Basset hound.
Skipper!
Alex wants to take out the dam.
All right!
But it's his funeral.
- Hard to port!
- Aye-aye, Skippy!
Bring it on!
Bring it on!
Come back!
That's my dinner!
Kowalski, full throttle.
Music!
- I like this song.
- It never gets old.
It does have a catchy hook.
Come about!
Bring her in low!
Hold onto your skirts!
It's dam-busting time!
Hold on tight, baby!
Here we go!
Tell them no!
Pull up!
They'll kill us!
There's got to be another way!
Pass it on!
They say no pull up.
Kill us.
There's no other way.
Basset hound.
Are you sure?
Men, there is no sacrifice greater than someone else's.
No!
Medic!
Ramming speed!
Bring it on!
Bad kitties.
I don't know why the sacrifice didn't work.
The science seemed so solid.
I'd jump right in that volcano if I wasn't so good at whistling.
It's you!
I found you!
Mort?
Bad fishy!
I wonder if the gods like seafood.
Let's find out.
Look, Maurice.
- That was quick.
- I did it!
I did it!
I did it!
OK, you did it!
Oh, yes!
Look!
- It's Alakay!
- It's Zuba!
You did it!
Alakay, Zuba, you did it!
Zuba!
Alakay!
You're back!
I'm so glad you're safe!
Out of my way.
Well, well, well.
You know, Zuba, if I remember correctly, you quit the pride.
And you were kicked out.
So don't think that this changes anything.
You're right.
In fact, we humbly present you with this token of appreciation.
A man bag.
Very popular where I'm from.
- Don't know what to say.
- Still be tough and carry your stuff.
Does the strap adjust?
This will go very nicely for me when I go out hiking.
But you're still banished.
We figured you'd say that.
My handbag!
You bad kitty!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
You deserve this, son.
Welcome to the pride.
Thanks, Dad.
But this belongs to you.
No, son.
To us!
My son!
The King of New York!
That's my baby!
Love transcends all differences.
We are gathered here today to celebrate such a love.
Do you take each other, for better or for worse?
For better, please.
What a beautiful, weird couple!
That's not going to last.
Can I kiss the bride?
No!
Music!
- Struts.
- Check.
- Flaps!
- Check.
- Diamonds and gold.
- Check.
- Bye-bye!
- We'll miss you!
See you later!
We'll be back after the honeymoon in Monte Carlo, or whenever the gold runs out.
Come back soon!
Mom, let them take their time.
New York isn't going anywhere, right, guys?
You're right about that!
As long as I'm with her and you two, I don't care where we are.
She has the most amazing laugh.
Love has no boundaries!
Looks like you're stuck with us for a while.
Dad?
What's wrong?
I just thought we could hang out a bit and...
- You got me!
- I got you, son!
You got me with my thing.
You brought it back around on me.
I got you, son!
The old man's not too bad, eh, Marty?
- Marty?
Who's Marty?
- Come on.
- I don't know no Marty.
- You can't fool me.
Ain't no Marty here.
Marty!
I can look into your eyes, and I know it's you.
See, I've been traveling Been traveling forever
But now that I found a home feels like I'm in heaven
See, I've been traveling Been traveling forever
But now that I'm home
Hey!
Shake the hot things!
Shake the hot things!
Shake 'em!
Shake 'em!
Shake 'em!
Well done, boys.
Looks like ice-cold sushi for breakfast.
No, no, son.
Over here.
See the lion?
Look at the lion and get the lion.
Now, son, if you're gonna grow up and be like your daddy someday, you gotta learn how to fight.
Da-da.
Now, Alakay, let me show you something, OK?
You see this mark?
You and me are the same.
When you're bigger, you'll be Alpha Lion, just like me.
Now let me see you fight.
Ready?
No, Alakay.
No dancing!
You just amuse yourself, don't you?
You're a strange kid.
You're a strange one.
I'm...
Now, come on, let's try it again.
No, Alakay.
Stop that right now.
Doggone it!
It's so disappointing when they don't grow up the way you want.
Makunga.
You're not challenging me again, are you?
Look on the bright side.
After I defeat you and become alpha lion, you'll have more time to spend with your pathetic son.
Before I kick your butt, let me ask you:
Why do you want to become the alpha lion?
I'm better looking, I have better hair, I'm deceivingly smart and I want everyone else to do what I say.
We fight on three.
One...
Pay attention, Alakay.
Daddy will show you how it's done.
Two, three!
- Who's the alpha lion?
- You are.
Don't you forget it.
And that, Alakay, is how you attack...
Alakay?
That's it.
Here, kitty, kitty.
This one's a beauty.
He'll be worth a few bucks.
Itjust gets easier and easier.
Daddy!
Alakay!
Alakay!
Alakay!
Da-da!
No!
No!
No!
Alakay!
- Daddy!
- Daddy's got you!
Hold on!
Da-da!
Alakay!
Daddy!
I've been around the world in the pouring rain
Feeling out of place and feeling strange
Take me to a place where they know my name
'Oause I ain't met nobody that looks the same
I'm a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle

See I been traveling Been traveling forever...
- I don't like the looks of this guy.
- He's kind of cute.
He's kind of a showoff.
You think he's cute?
Roar!
The King of New York Oity Alex the Lion!
I still think he's kind of a showoff.
The guy's an animal.
Maybe he should take a break.
You know, we could all use a vacation.
Oome on, where would we go on vacation?
I don't know about you, but I want to go to Oonnecticut!
On the loose, several animals, including the world famous Alex the Lion, escaped from the Oentral Park Zoo tonight.
The escapees were cornered in Grand Oentral Station.
He was a very bad kitty.
Animal rights activists, who convinced zoo officials to have the animals sent to Africa, were stunned to learn that the freighter carrying the animals was reported missing today.
Tonight, hundreds of New Yorkers have gathered at the zoo to mourn the loss of their beloved zoo animals.
The question on everyone's mind, where are they now?
I like to move it, move it
He likes to move it, move it
She likes to move it, move it
- We like to
- Move it!
Oome on!
Y'all know this one!
It never gets stale!
- We like to
- Move it!
We'll miss you little fuzz buckets!
You've been a great crowd!
Glad we could introduce you to the toilet.
If you ever come look us up in Manhattan, feel free to call first.
Seriously though, call.
OK?
Settle down, everybody.
Be quiet!
You can't leave without this!
Surprise, freaks!
Shake it!
Shake it.
Look, I'm a lady!
I'm a lady, everyone!
I'm a lady!
Not really!
It's me, King Julien!
Which of you is attracted to me?
Hands up!
Hey, freaks!
You will be very glad to hear that I am coming with you.
Oh, no, thank you.
Yes, thank you.
It's my plane!
Until I return with the spoils from the new country Stevie will be in charge!
I don't think they like that idea.
What are you saying, Stevie?
No.
Oould we...?
No, you didn't say that!
How is that even possible?
Naughty little thing!
Stevie says...
Let them eat cake!
King Julien, wait for me!
I'm all packed!
I have a whole itinerary planned!
Oh, no!
It's Mort!
He's so annoying!
Don't let him on.
Stop that thing!
He's carrying scissors and hand cream!
Everybody in!
Quickly, get in, get in!
Get in quick!
- Struts.
- Oheck.
- Flaps.
- Oheck.
- Engine.
Ooffee maker.
- Oheck.
You guys!
Oopsie-daisy!
That has to be the second biggest slingshot I've ever seen.
But it'll have to do.
Attention.
This is your captain speaking.
In the event of an emergency, place the vest over your head then kiss your... good-bye.
New York Oity, here we come!
Pray to your personal God this hunk ofjunk flies.
Personal God, hunk...?
What?
We are go, sir.
Open the door!
I'm outside!
If cabin pressure is lost, place the mask over your face to hide your terrified expression.
Miss, aren't these supposed to be attached to my seat?
- No, sir.
- OK, boys, launch!
Launch!
- Launch!
- Launch!
Gremlin!
Hey, Mort.
Hi!
That was weird.
- Somebody's dreaming.
- I think I saw Mort on the plane wing.
You got Madagascar on the brain.
I know I'm gonna miss it.
It was incredible.
I think it'll seem more fun the further we are from it.
Like when you bit me on the butt?
I'm gonna take that thing you're holding onto and use it onstage.
It's all part of my little actor's salad bar of emotional tidbits.
Are the butts next to the croutons?
You don't need to be sarcastic.
When we get back, I might sign up for the breeding program.
Breeding program?
We reach a point when we want to meet somebody.
Settle down, have a relationship.
I can see that.
What?
Like dating?
Yeah, dating.
Other... other guys?
What do you mean, other guys?
Darn it!
What is holding up that beverage service?
!
I'm gonna go check.
You all keep talking.
I'm gonna catch a few winks.
It's so funny!
I like laughing!
It's such a nice experience!
To laugh!
Do you mind going back?
This is first class.
It's nothing personal.
We're just better than you.
Maurice, I'm open!
Hit me!
- He shoots, he scores!
- Is that Vivaldi?
- In-flight slave.
- Oan I help you, Mr. Mankiewicz?
Bring my nuts on a silver platter.
We were checking on our drink order.
Sorry.
Been a little backed up.
- I guess I'll go back...
- Where's your body?
You're freaking me out!
Oan you please go over there, please?
What happened to the separation of the classes?
I'm sure this democracy thing is just a fad.
We'll go out for pineapple, my bobbly-headed boobily-boo.
Skipper, look.
Analysis.
Looks like a small bulb used to indicate something unusual, like a malfunction.
I find it pretty and somewhat hypnotic.
That too, sir.
Right!
Rico?
Manual!
Problemo solved.
- We may be out of fuel.
- Why do you think so?
We've lost engine one and engine two is no longer on fire.
Buckle up, boys.
Don't look, doll.
This might get hairy.
Attention!
This is your captain.
I have good and bad news.
The good news is, we're landing immediately.
The bad news is, we're crash-landing.
When it comes to air travel, we know you have no choice.
But thanks for choosing Air Penguin.
Raise your arms, Maurice!
It's more fun when you raise your arms!
I can fly!
This could be it, Marty!
I want you to know you are a one-in-a-million friend!
Thanks, buddy!
You're the best ever!
- And you won't mind when I tell you...
- Tell me anything!
I broke your iPod!
The buttons were so small!
It made me mad!
- The horror!
- I'm sorry!
- I'll kill you, butt-biter!
- It was an accident!
- An accident!
- Butt-biter!
I love you, Gloria!
I always have!
Like you love the beach.
Or a good book.
Or the beach.
Goodness, doll, you're shaking like a leaf.
Rico, you've had your fun.
Pull up.
Gear down.
Gently.
You just want to kiss the ground.
Just a peck, a smooch, like you'd kiss your sister.
I said, kiss it!
Now just a little brake.
Just a touch.
I believe that's checkmate.
Oommence emergency landing procedure.
Flaps up!
Deploy!
Oh, we're here.
What in the world?
What happened to the plane?
What did y'all do to the plane?
I'm OK.
I'm alive.
I can't even sleep for a minute.
This is not JFK.
Kowalski, casualty report.
Two passengers unaccounted for.
That's a number I can live with.
Good landing, boys.
Who says a penguin can't fly?
Hey, happy slappers!
Is there some reason to celebrate?
Look at the plane!
- We'll fix it.
- How are you gonna fix this?
Grit, spit and a whole lot of duct tape.
We should be up and running in, say, six to nine months.
- Sixty-nine months?
!
- No, six to nine months.
Kowalski, I say we use this setback to our advantage.
- Where'd you get that number?
- I want you to reconfigure the design.
How do you estimate that?
Pretty boy!
Why don't you and your friends dig a latrine.
Hold on.
Who made you king of the plane wreck?
Excuse me?
Fine.
You can be in charge.
You fix the plane.
Who gives you the authority to put me in charge?
OK, then I'll remain in charge.
Yeah, you will remain in charge.
You and your hippie friends stay out of our hair.
Oorrecto-mundo.
Because I decided to.
- Good for you.
- Well, this discussion isn't over.
Higher mammals!
Stay with us.
We could use your front cortexes and opposable thumbs.
Phil!
I should wash your hands out with soap.
How in the hell-o will they fix this plane?
!
You know, grit and spit and spit.
A lot of spit and grit and stick-to-it-iveness.
That don't sound too promising.
You're right.
We're stuck here.
As long as we're together, we'll be OK.
Yeah, but love ain't gonna get us home.
Behold!
The lion!
- People!
- There is much to see.
Moving on.
Wait, wait, wait!
People!
- They'll help us!
- Wait up!
- People!
Stop!
- Help us!
If you stop, I'll autograph those!
I know you!
You.
It's the bad kitty.
How do you like some of that?
!
Oome in, Tokyo!
Right in the batteries.
You think an old lady can't take care of herself?
Next time, I won't go so easy on you!
Thank you, dear.
Moving on!
Are you out of your mind?
We need help and you harass old ladies?
!
Out of my mind?
Who's out of my mind now?
- See if you can get an operator.
- No problem.
Out of my mind.
We're going home.

Am I trippin'?
All those zebras...
like me.
- Where are we?
- San Diego.
This time I'm 40 percent sure.
- I know this place.
- I think it's Africa.
Africa?
It's got to be.
Our ancestral crib.
It's in our blood.
I can feel it!
No, it's more than that.
It's like déja vu, like I've been here before.
It's like Roots!
No, it's like déja vu, like I've been here before.
How!
How!
Me Alex!
Me and me friends fly, fly in great metal bird.
Then plummet!
Smash ground!
Go boom!
Then here we emerge.
We offer only happiness and good greetings.
Is he dancing about a plane crash?
Yeah.
We just... yeah.
I thought...
Sorry.
You came from off the reserve?
Way off.
From the Oentral Park Zoo, actually.
Don't strain yourself.
What's going on here?
They say they're from off the reserve.
That's impossible.
Only people come from off the reserve.
You look familiar.
Do I know you?
How could you survive the hunters?
We didn't see any hunters.
- What are you looking at?
- Me?
Nothing.
This watering hole doesn't need any more mouths to feed.
So skedaddle back to where you came from.
Is there a manager we could talk to?
I see.
You're here to challenge me!
What?
No!
No.
That's what it looks like to me!
Zuba!
Wait.
I'm trying to take care of business...
Yeah, yeah, Zuba.
Hold on.
Alakay?
Is that you?
No, it's Alex. lx.
Like New York Knicks.
Zuba, look!
I've always had that.
The vet checked it out.
It's kind of a beauty spot, really.
A mark.
All right, this is a little weird.
Honey, he's come home.
What?
You've come home.
Son.
Dad.
Mom and Dad?
Mom and Dad!
Mom and Dad!
It's my mom and dad!
I got a mom and dad!
My baby's alive!
Dad!
My son!
My son is home!
Alakay!
Alakay has come home!
Alakay!
Yeah!
The prodigal son returns.
This is perfect!
I thought you hated Zuba.
No, I do.
I do.
I do.
I hate him.
Oh, I do.
And I'm going to use Alakay, yes.
I'm going to use him to get rid of Zuba once and for all!
Giddy-up, feathered horse!
Make way!
Move out of the way!
Stand aside!
New York!
It's a bit of a dump.
Are you sure we're not in New Jersey?
Hello, New Yorkers!
Your new king is here!
This calls for a celebration!
Maurice, I think they like me.
You've got to love a non-hostile takeover!
Ohukka-chukka what?
Excuse me.
I'm Marty.
I'm kind of new around here.
Hey, Marty!
You're a good-looking group!
You like to run?
Yeah.
Running is crack-a-lackin'.
That's right!
Orack-a-lackin'.
You guys speak my crack-a-lackin' language.
What?
You don't have doctors here?
Not anymore.
Well, what if you catch a cold?
We go over to the dying holes and we die.
You guys really need a doctor.
- We have an opening.
- Would you be interested?
Me?
A doctor?
It's raining men.
Hallelujah!
You all got it going on.
Why don't you have a man?
You got worms?
Oh, I got rid of those.
Listen, girls.
Manhattan is short on two things, parking and hippos.
Hey, everybody!
I just found out that my son is a doggone king!
The King of New York!
Show me some of your moves, son.
Don't be bashful.
All right.
This one always knocks 'em dead.
Roar!
Look out.
The King is mad.
The King is mad!
Let's welcome him back into the pride with open arms!
Welcome to the herd, Marty!
Me?
I've always wanted to be part of a herd!
- It's one for all...
- [all] And all for all, y'all!
How do I look?
Technically, a traditional witch doctor has a bone through his nose.
Don't worry... it's just a clip-on.
Voila!
He's a witch doctor!
My mother will be so happy.
Look out!
I think Moto Moto likes you.
Here he comes.
I like 'em big
I like 'em chunky
I like 'em big I like 'em plumpy
I like 'em round With something' somethin'
They like my sound They think I'm funky
Goodness, girl... you huge.
Who's your friend?
Or is that your butt?
You as quick as you are hefty.
So you're Moto Moto?
The name's so nice, you say it twice.
I kind of like it, fatso.
I'll see you around, girl.
It won't be hard, because you so... plumpy.
Oops!
I hate to be a party pooper, Zuba, but some of the lions were wondering when you plan to banish your son.
- What are you talking about?
- It's nothing, really.
They're griping that Alakay never went through the rite of passage, blah, blah, blah, so technically speaking, he can't be a member of the pride.
It's nonsense.
I forgot about the rite of passage.
What is it?
What's this rite of passage?
A traditional coming-of-age ceremony.
Young lions earn their manes by demonstrating their skills.
- A show-of-skill talent show deal?
- Yeah.
Strutting their stuff.
A performance!
I think that's up my alley.
If it's tradition, I want to do it.
Strut my stuff.
Earn my mane.
I want to be Alaki.
- Alakay.
- Alakay!
Even better.
We will hold the rite of passage in the morning!
That's wonderful!
Good luck, Alakay.
Where I'm from, we say, "Break a leg."
That's my boy!
I'm a private dancer
A dancer for money
Any old music will do
Beautiful, isn't it?
It's amazing.
Guys this is where we belong.
Operation Tourist Trap is a go.
Oh, I like that one.
It works on many levels.
You guys are a bunch of suck-ups.
- That, too.
- Absolutely.
Stations.
Stage one.
Go!
Oh, no!
What have I done?
Oome on, take the bait.
- What happened?
- Oh, look at the poor little guy.
Is it dead?
Stage two!
Go, go, go!
I will give him the kiss of life.
Rico!
Rico!
Reverse!
Gas!
Music!
No!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Oome back!
What is all this rock'n'roll racket?
!
Is she dead?
No!
You hoodlums!
Good heavens!
Are you OK?
Lady, I found your pocketbook.
My handbag.
Such a good boy.
Nana can't survive without it.
You are one tough cookie.
Brownies Troop 416, Yonkers.
OK, nobody panic!
The best thing we can do is stay together.
We'll wait for another tourjeep.
It may take hours, but...
Where are you going?
I'm not staying here to be attacked by more animals!
I'm too old to die.
I'm going with her.
Old lady, wait up!
Please!
We need to stay together.
Fine!
We'll go that way!
Does anyone want a hard candy?
- Easy now.
- Watch your step.
And right here...
OK, are you ready?
This is where you always slept.
Oh, man!
- Was this mine?
- Look at you.
Look at him.
Oh, this thing.
Look, look!
- I remember this!
- He remembers.
A little harder than...
You never slept on the right end.
You always slept on the bottom end.
Is that...?
Is that my...?
Is that me?
You had the cutest little paws.
Little, little bitty ol' paws.
You did that the day we lost you.
Wow.
I was so young.
What happened to me?
It was all my fault.
I turned my back and...
It was not your fault.
Your father did everything he could.
He tracked those hunters for weeks.
Far off the reserve.
Finally, I had to assume the hunters well...
We thought they'd killed you.
But my son fought them off!
Don't mess with the King of New York!
- That's right!
- Keep your chin in.
You boys be careful!
Watch out before you break something.
You used to call this "foofie."
"Foofie"?
Foofie.
He doesn't want that.
This is my foofie!
Zuba, you better give him his foofie.
I mean, no, thank you, thank you.
It's perfect.
Son, you get your rest.
You have a big day tomorrow.
You'll need all your strength.
I will bring the house down for you.
I hope so.
Otherwise, your father will have to banish you.
Jeez, Mom, really?
I know you'll do us proud.
You know why?
You were born with it.
Good night, Alakay.
My boy.
My own boy.
My son's a king.
My son's a king.
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Alakay.
Foofie.
Look at foofie!
My foofie!
Foofie, foofie, foofie.
My foofie!
No sign of civilization.
Everybody appears very tired.
I think we're lost.
Nana, do you know where you're going?
No, but I'm going with a skip in my step and a smile on my face.
Sure, right, OK.
Yeah, all right.
- It's people.
- How did you get here?
- Oan you help us?
We're lost.
- We're lost too.
It was awful.
A flash of black and white and they were gone.
They took the jeep!
- That happened to ourjeep too!
- What do we do?
How will we all survive?
No food, no water, no shelter.
What are we gonna do?
!
You can let nature get the best of you, or you can get the best of nature.
Gather 'round, children.
We're New Yorkers, right?
Yeah.
We survive the concrete jungle!
When we need food, we hunt for a decent hot dog stand.
- Am I right?
- She's right.
When we need shelter, we build skyscrapers.
- Exactly!
- When we need water, we build a dam.
We're New Yorkers, for crying out loud!
If we can make it there, we can make it anywhere!
I'm coming, King Julien!
Bad fishy!
Bad fishy!
No, shark, no!
Sit!
Why am I laughing?
We have all the parts we need, but we're slightly behind schedule.
- How slightly?
- Six to nine years.
- Sixty-nine years?
- No, six to nine years.
Private!
What happened to our thumbs?
Haven't seen them since yesterday.
Darn you, Darwin!
Nobody goes AWOL on my watch.
Private!
You're coming with me.
Rico!
You're coming with me!
- We'll bring them in for court martial.
- That won't be necessary!
We've recruited a few extra thumbs for you, Skipper.
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.
Oh, I doubt that.
Enough lollygagging.
Let's get to work.
There'll be three groups.
Group Alpha will do sheet metal fabrication.
Group Bronson handles assembly.
Group George Peppard, craft services.
Any questions?
Good!
Let's get to work.
I'd like to kiss you, monkey man.
All right, but you're so darn ugly.
Remember, little cub scouts, a great dance performance comes from the heart.
Straight from the heart, you'll never go wrong.
Sure, mister.
Hey, Alakay, I just happened to walk by, I thought I'd wish you luck.
- You're not nervous, are you?
- Nah, it's my thing.
In my opinion, the key to this is choosing the right competitor.
You mean, this is like a dance battle sort of thing?
- Like a dance-off?
- Sure.
Great.
I love that.
Freestyle.
Who'd be a good match for me?
Just to keep things interesting.
Well, I wish I could help, but that's strictly against our ancient tradition and all we hold sacred.
But if it was me out there...
I'd choose Teetsi.
Teetsi.
OK.
Sounds interesting.
Makunga, right?
Thank you.
Anything for Zuba's boy.
Go get 'em, tiger.
Shake it out.
A five, six, seven, eight.
Let's go, let's do this.
Let us begin the rite of passage ceremony.
- Oome on, baby!
Make Mama proud!
- Woman, I'm trying to take...
On it, Mom!
Who will be the first participant?
Me!
Oh!
Me, me, me!
Me!
Me!
Me!
Me, me!
Please, me?
How about you?
The tall, handsome one.
Yeah.
Ohoose your opponent.
Let me see.
I guess I'll pick Teetsi?
Teetsi?
Why did he pick Teetsi?
That's my boy!
He's got some gumption there!
Somebody, wake him up!
All right, so, Teetsi, come on.
Let's do this, huh?
Oome on, little tsetse fly.
Let's see your stuff.
Bring it.
- Let's dance!
- OK.
But let me warn you that I am a protégé of Fosse and Robbins!
Not "dance" dance!
Fight!
Dance fight!
You got it.
- Is he dancing?
- What's he doing?
I know that boy is not dancing.
This is even better than I thought.
Alakay, turn around!
No, Pop, it's hop, shuffle, ball change, hip swish, turn around.
Oh, no.
Alakay!
Are you hurt?
Yeah, I am.
Did I... did I win?
No, son.
How could this happen?
You told us you were a king.
A king does not get beat.
I am a king.
I'm the King of New York.
It's my stage name.
Like for when I perform.
Perform?
Oh, no, this is horrible!
Alakay has failed the test!
Who would have ever imagined that today Zuba would have to banish his own son?
Zuba, no.
Zuba, yes.
Sadly, the alpha lion must cast out all failures.
Then I'm no longer the alpha lion.
Dad, what are you doing?
Dad, no!
You can't do this.
Who could possibly take Zuba's place?
Anyone?
Someone?
No one?
You, sir!
I guess not.
Well, I... this is all very awkward, but I suppose I could carry this tremendous burden.
Teetsi!
Get the hat.
As your new leader, I hereby banish Alakay!
He shall wear this Hat of Shame and leave the watering hole for a thousand years, or life!
Whichever comes last.
Shoo, shoo!
Get out of here!
You should have told us you weren't a real king, son!
You never told me I'd have to fight anybody!
What did you expect?
!
I don't know!
Maybe a little fatherly advice like, "Hey, son, it's a fight!"
- You're a lion!
- But I never fought another lion!
No, I guess not.
You dance!
And other stuff!
Your pal, Makunga, set me up back there!
- None of this would have happened...
- If you were a real lion.
- Zuba!
- Yeah, I said it!
A real lion.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Saw.
Suture.
Swab.
You're in my light, Stephen.
You have a brown spot on your shoulder.
That's very observant, Stephen.
As you can see, I'm covered in brown spots.
OK!
That bone will be good as new in a few weeks.
So I don't have to pick out a dying hole?
No, you got your whole life ahead of you.
- Really?
- Go out and grab it by the horns.
- Thank you, Dr. Mankiewicz!
- Break a leg!
Sweet kid.
This spot looks like Witch Doctor's Disease.
Witch Doctor's Disease?
That's the most ridiculous disease I've ever heard of.
- Don't ask.
- Someone's been knotty.
This won't hurt a bit.
Joe, our last witch doctor, had a spotjust like that.
- And?
- Monday, Joe.
Wednesday, no Joe.
Wednesday, no Joe?
I can breathe!
Thanks, doc!
So this Witch Doctor's Disease is a real thing?
You'll find a cure.
You've got at least 48 hours!
But I've never heard of it.
I mean...
I don't have any penicillin.
I'll need a OAT scan just to get started!
Have a lion look you over.
They'd be happy to.
Ta-da!
- He has talent.
- Stupendous and tremendous.
Hollah!
Bet you've never seen that one!
Knocked 'em dead in New York!
- Let's all give it a try!
- Let's do it!
Well, you can try all you want to, but it takes years of practice.
You'll never get a tight stream until you build up your lip muscles to the point where you can purse your lips like this.
You got it?
Ta-da!
How did you...?
You guys got it right out of the box!
- If you can do it...
...we can do it.
It's in our blood!
I always thought I was a bit unique.
We are unique!
We are like a force of nature!
- A million points of light!
- And dark stripes!
Exactly the same!
Exactly the same.
Looks impressive, Kowalski, but will it fly?
Yes.
If we fold it here, here and here.
Nice.
Oh, man.
My dad thinks I'm a total loser.
I've ruined my parents' lives.
That is definitely not crack-a-lackin'.
It is lacking' in the cracking', my friend.
I've gotta fix this.
So there's...
There's something I gotta tell you.
Hey, guys.
Is this place great or what?
!
I'd go with "or what."
Well, I'll tell you what.
You're not gonna believe it, but I got a date with Moto Moto.
Who's Moto Moto?
Oh, he's so big and handsome and big!
- Know what "Moto Moto" means?
- Twins?
It means, "Hot Hot."
"Hot Hot"?
When did you start parlez-ing African?
It's in my blood.
Don't worry, you can flirt around with Mr. Hot Pants after I'm gone.
Melman, why am I the parade and you're the rain?
Why are you driving your parade under my rain?
Maybe I'll parade in another part of town!
Whoa, guys.
Main Street's mine!
Well, you can have it!
And you can take your hotee-tot float and Mr. Hotee Moto Moto...
- What are you talking about?
- What are we talking about?
Melman, just tell her.
What?
What are you...
I don't know what you're talking about.
I guess I'll go, then.
Don't bother.
- Don't get up on my account.
- Melman!
Gloria!
- I thought you guys were friends!
- Marty's absolutely right.
- Marty?
- Marty?
Marty?
What the heck is going on?
You're not...?
Oh!
He was...
I thought he...
You're not him.
He's...
Oh.
You thought that guy was me?
No.
I mean, yes, you...
Guys, come on.
You thought I was him?
You guys kind of do look a little...
You look a lot alike.
Marty, you look a lot alike.
You laugh alike.
Talk alike.
He has the same speech pattern.
It's a little weird, really.
I mean, come on.
Marty.
So you're saying there's nothing unique about me.
I'm just like any other zebra.
No.
Of course you're different!
How?
OK, I can't tell you apart.
Maybe you could wear a bell or something.
- A bell?
!
- OK, not a bell.
Bell's a bad idea.
How about a T-shirt that says, "I'm with stupid"?
- I'm not stupid!
- Not you, stupid!
Him, stupid!
You know, while you've been doing the prancing pony with your new posse,
I've been having the worst day of my life.
It's always about you, isn't it?
My problems are just a little bit bigger than yours.
I couldn't tell you apart.
So what?
!
Yeah, fine.
Run away, Marty!
Run away!
That's what you do best!
Just like back in New York!
I'm right here.
But you can't tell that, right?
Your one-of-a-million friend hopes you enjoy your bigger-than-anyone-else's problems alone!
Good, leave!
I don't need you to help me solve my problems!
You're a dime a dozen!
I can't tell which one's Marty!
Which one's Marty?
Wait a minute.
Oh, yeah, I don't care!
Nice hat, you showoff!
Marty don't go.
Giddy-up, giddy-up!
Giddy-up, giddy-up!
Look, Maurice!
The perfect spot for my summer palace!
Please fill in all these holes and relocate the riff-raff.
- Who'd leave a perfectly good head?
- What a waste.
Tell me about it.
I'm in my prime here.
I'm terminal, you know?
I probably only have another two days left to live.
That's a bummer, man.
If I, King Julien... that's my name only had two days left to live,
I would do all the things
- I've ever dreamed of doing.
- Like what?
I'd love to become a professional whistler.
I'm pretty amazing at it now, but I want to get even better, make my living out of it.
You know what else I would do?
I would invade a neighboring country and impose my own ideology, even if they didn't want it!
Easy for you to say.
You're a king.
Yes.
And you are only just a sad little head.
There must be something you want to do before you die!
- There is this one thing.
- What?
Tell me.
- No, I couldn't.
- What is it?
I never told Gloria how I feel about her.
What is it?
Please tell me!
I never had the guts to tell Gloria how I feel about her.
How I've always felt about her.
Fine.
Don't tell me!
Is it a woman?
You didn't tell me it's a woman.
What are you afraid of?
You're a dead man anyway.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're right.
You've got to march right up to this woman.
Look her right in the eye.
Lean forward.
Just a little, or almost all the way.
Then you let her lean forward a little until you're just lips' distance away from each other.
Then you tell her how much you hate her.
Actually, it's more like love her.
Oh, you sly dog!
Woof, woof!
You're a real player.
Now listen to me.
You got to rise up.
You hearing me?
- He didn't hear you.
- I can't hear you!
- You got to rise up!
- Rising up!
- Get out of the hole!
- I'm rising out of the ground!
- He's rising, Maurice.
- I'm rising, Maurice!
- Rising!
- You go right up to this woman!
Do you feel it?
- Go up to her face!
- Tell the truth!
- I'm going to tell her!
- Then you say, "Baby, I dig you!"
Yeah!
I'm going to do it!
I'm going to do it!
I love that happy little head.
She love
Moto Moto
She love
Moto Moto
She loves me She loves my eyes
She loves me She loves my thighs
She loves my roundness
She love that I'm chunky She love that I'm plumpy
She love my heftiness She love my zestiness
She love me restlessly She love me forever
She love me 'cause she love me
Moto Moto before things get too serious, well,
I was wondering, if I were to, for example, stay here I'd like to ask you...
Let your candied lips be the messengers to my... ear canal.
I have so many questions.
I promise the answer will always be yes.
Unless no is required.
So what is it about me that you find so interesting?
You're the most plumpenest girl I've ever met.
OK.
Other than that.
Let's see.
Yeah, well, you know... you chunky.
Right.
My gosh, girl, you huge.
You said that.
Yeah, that's right.
We don't have to talk no more.
Gloria!
Gloria.
Melman.
Melman, I want you to meet Moto Moto.
Moto Moto.
Yeah, nice to meet you.
- I guess I...
- It's OK, Melman.
Apology accepted.
Oh.
Yeah, right, that.
That's why I...
Good.
OK.
Well, that's it, then.
Good.
We're kind of busy here, man.
No.
No, that's not it.
Listen, Mototo, you better treat this lady like a queen.
Because you, my friend, you found yourself the perfect woman.
If I was ever so lucky to find the perfect woman,
I'd give her flowers every day.
And notjust any flowers.
OK?
Her favorites are orchids.
White.
And breakfast in bed.
Six loaves of wheat toast, butter on both sides.
No crust, the way she likes it.
I'd be her shoulder to cry on and her best friend.
I'd spend every day thinking of how to make her laugh.
She has the most amazing laugh.
That's what I would do if I were you.
But I'm not, so you do it.
OK.
What?
That was beautiful.
Anyways, where were we?
I'm "huge"?
Surprised to see me, Makunga?
Well, I'm here to set things straight, like a real lion!
Is this real enough for you?
How about this?
This is for setting me up!
This is for stealing my dad's job!
This is for humiliating my family!
And making me look like a fool!
Had enough?
Sure, fly away!
Ooward.
The water.
It's gone.
It's never gone dry before.
- We'll need a lot more dying holes.
- How could this happen?
Out of my way!
What is going on here?
!
The watering hole is dry!
There's barely water for one of us!
- Good observation, Shirley.
- I'm Bobby.
Makunga, what do we do?
Quiet!
Listen up!
I'm afraid there is only one solution to this horrible crisis:
We'll all have to fight for it.
- We can't fight for it.
- That's crazy.
That's not fair.
You'd win!
Exactly, Shirley.
I'm Bob...
Sorry, folks, but life isn't fair.
I'm in charge now, thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion.
Please, Makunga, this is the only water on the reserve.
If you're thirsty, you'll have to look for water off the reserve.
- Off the reserve?
- It's too dangerous!
Hunters would shoot us!
No one leaves the reserve and survives!
I left the reserve!
And survived.
I can do something about this.
Looks like a clogged pipe, like we get in New York.
I'll travel upriver...
- Upriver?
- Off the reserve?
You?
Yeah.
I'll unclog the pipe and bring back your water.
Great!
I'd help you pack, but by the looks of that hat, I see you're all set!
Fine.
Go ahead, laugh.
Laugh your mane off.
I'll prove you wrong.
Maybe you should try a little rain dance.
Zuba would know what to do.
- Where's Zuba?
- You don't care about us.
Zuba should be in charge, not you.
All right, fine!
As an added measure, I will consult with Zuba!
Marty?
Hey!
Marty!
Marty?
Marty.
Where'd you get the fruity hat?
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
Hi.
Is Marty in there?
Anyone seen Marty?
Which one of us is Marty?
All right.
Well, if you see him, tell him his friend Alex came to say goodbye.
Goodbye?
Don't go.
Where are you going?
- Oan we come?
- No.
I have to do this alone.
You can't leave the reserve!
What are you doing?
- They'll get your hat.
- Hunters are everywhere!
Oould you leave the hat?
Marty!
I know you're in there.
Before I go, I got something I want to say.
You've been a great friend.
You've helped me so often to see the bright side of my problems that I never think of you having any.
I wasn't there for you when you needed me.
Just like back at the zoo.
What kind of friend does that make me?
A pretty lousy friend, I guess.
I just want you to know that I...
You're one in a million.
This is touching.
It is touching.
So could you turn around so I can tell you to your face?
That's right.
Gotcha!
I see you in there!
Yeah, you.
You, right there.
Twelfth row, two hundred and third from the left.
That's you, Marty.
I know it's you.
Know what makes you special?
These guys are white with black stripes.
You're black with white stripes.
You're a dreamer, Marty.
Always have been.
You have great taste in music and horrible taste in friends.
Well, not Melman and Gloria, but me.
OK, I'm in.
Marty, you can't come with me.
You don't have a choice.
- People are out there!
- You're crazy!
Oome back!
The people will get you!
Don't lose the hat!
Bye, hat!
Any water?
No, just more diamonds and gold.
Don't give up hope.
Listen up!
I will help you!
There's only one way to get your precious water.
I, your beloved King Julien must simply make a small sacrifice to my good friends, the water gods, in the volcano!
What does that do?
What does that do?
Excellent question.
My sacrifice goes in the volcano.
The friendly gods eat up my sacrifice.
"Thank you for the sacrifice."
"Here, have another." "No, I've had enough."
"I'll be insulted unless you have another."
"I don't want another sacrifice!"
"Look at you!
You're skinny!" "No!
I've had enough!"
The gods eat the sacrifice.
They are grateful.
They give me some water, and then I give it to you.
What?
Does it work?
No!
I mean, yes.
Well, Maurice?
Ah, it's fifty-fifty.
We'll do it!
Excellent!
Now all I need is someone who would like to go into the volcano and get eaten by gods.
Any hands!
Hands, anybody!
I need someone, perhaps who has never found love, who could look death straight in the eyeball.
A real, genuine hero.
- I'll do it.
- Melman?
Hurry up!
Before we all come to our senses!
Melman, what is wrong with you?
I'm dying anyway.
If there's a chance it'll get you water, it's worth it.
Are you nuts?
I want you to know, back at the zoo, it was never the doctors or prescriptions that kept me going.
It was always you.
Seeing you every day.
That's what kept me going.
Melman!
Wait!
Melman!
Melman!
Melman!
You going to mope like this all day?
Don't "hmph" me.
Listen, Zuba.
A miracle happened.
Our son came back to us.
How come that is not good enough for you?
What are you saying, woman?
We lost him once, Zuba.
Let's not lose him again.
Zuba!
- Zuba!
- Get out of here!
What do you want?
It's awful.
The watering hole is dried up.
Dried up?
That's impossible!
There's nothing left!
You're alpha lion, Makunga.
What are you gonna do about it?
Your son, Alakay, he said he could fix it.
He's gone upriver.
- Off the reserve?
!
- No!
I tried to stop him.
I told him it was suicide.
He was determined to prove himself to you.
You stay here, in case he comes back!
Hurry, Zuba!
I'm so parched.
Is this place starting to freak you out?
We'll slip in, find the problem.
Hunters will never know we were here.
Why are we doing this?
Maybe my dad will think I'm...
I want to show him I'm a real lion.
As opposed to a chocolate lion.
I know this may sound hard to believe, but apparently, lions don't dance.
What?
!
As far as my dad is concerned.
As far as people are concerned, you're a hit.
In New York.
This is Africa...
much tougher crowd.
Marty, this is it!
This is the clog!
Oome on.
Well, there's the water.
Stay down.
Look at that.
Knit one, purl two.
It's her.
- Is this right?
- Very good.
Nana, slow down.
You're a little tangled, aren't you?
No, don't pull.
I'll do it.
We need dynamite.
Got any?
Oh, snap!
I just used my last stick this morning!
- Savages!
- Evasive maneuvers!
- Serpentine, serpentine!
- Squiggly squid maneuver!
Zag, zig-zag, zig ziggy zag!
No, no!
Squiggly squid!
Etch A Sketch!
That's too complex!
Octopus, octopus!
- Run, Marty!
- I can't leave you here!
Go get help!
Squiggly squid maneuver!
Go!
Go!
Squiggly squid!
Etch A Sketch!
Etch A Sketch!
Save us We love you
OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- Save us
- Melman
- We love you
- Melman
Save us
OK, here we go.
OK, OK.
- Melman
- We love you
- Melman
- Save us
Here we go!
Here we go!
- What's all the hoopla about?
- Joe?
Joe the Witch Doctor?
We thought you were dead!
So did I. Then I realized I'm covered in brown spots.
So Melman's not dying!
- Melman's not dying!
- Oh, no!
Melman!
Move!
Don't do this!
Julien, stop this!
This is crazy!
Oh, suddenly throwing a giraffe into a volcano to make water is crazy!
Yes!
- Please, Melman!
Stop!
- Gloria?
- You can't do this!
- Why not?
Because...
You can't do this, Melman.
First, that hurts.
Second, I've only got 18 hours to live, anyway.
Melman, I gotta know did you mean those things you said about me?
Of course I did.
- That's crazy.
- It is?
It's crazy to think I had to go halfway around the world to find out the perfect guy for me lived right next door.
Then it's you and me, neighbor.
You and me for the next 18 hours.
I'll take whatever you got.
- Maurice, what happened?
- I believe the fat lady has sung.
- What's going on here?
- Marty!
Alex is in big trouble!
We got to get upriver fast!
- What about the plane?
- Perfect!
Oome on!
The plane won't be fixed until the suits meet our demands.
Now, maternity leave.
Maternity leave?
You're all males.
We need that plane for a rescue mission.
There's nothing I can do until we bust up this union.
I'll bust up all of you if you don't get this plane going.
Oan't you see these commies have my hands tied?
No maternity leave.
Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want these blowing around on the savanna.
All right.
You get your maternity leave.
Finally.
Where we headed?
What's going on?
Where are we going?
Oh, no!
Please!
Don't put me there!
No!
This is wrong.
You see?
You are survivors.
Now, how about a nice lion casserole?
You can't eat a lion.
Don't worry, it tastes like chicken.
No, no, no.
Don't listen to her.
She's out of her mind, people!
I'm from New York Oity!
It's me, Alex the lion!
From Oentral Park!
Dad!
What were you thinking, son?
You got no business being out here!
Stay behind me.
They're New Yorkers.
They're just rude and frightened people.
Stay back!
You'd let your dinner get away?
- What are you doing?
- The only thing I know how to do.
What the heck?
Hey, I know those moves.
Alex?
- It's Alex the lion!
- From Oentral Park!
It is Alex!
Only one lion can move like that!
He's beautiful.
I can't believe it.
How does he do that?
What are you doing?
I'm dancing with my son!
I think.
Don't think, Dad.
Feel!
Butterfly!
I'm feeling it!
I'm feeling it!
Roar!
That was beautiful.
Now let's eat!
Dad, look out!
What the...
Alex!
Get in!
She's got a gun!
Get out while we can!
- What?
- She's got a gun!
Get out while we can!
Pass it on!
He said let's have some fun and take out the dam.
Basset hound.
Skipper!
Alex wants to take out the dam.
All right!
But it's his funeral.
- Hard to port!
- Aye-aye, Skippy!
Bring it on!
Bring it on!
Oome back!
That's my dinner!
Kowalski, full throttle.
Music!
- I like this song.
- It never gets old.
It does have a catchy hook.
Oome about!
Bring her in low!
Hold onto your skirts!
It's dam-busting time!
Hold on tight, baby!
Here we go!
Tell them no!
Pull up!
They'll kill us!
There's got to be another way!
Pass it on!
They say no pull up.
Kill us.
There's no other way.
Basset hound.
Are you sure?
Men, there is no sacrifice greater than someone else's.
No!
Medic!
Ramming speed!
Bring it on!
Bad kitties.
I don't know why the sacrifice didn't work.
The science seemed so solid.
I'd jump right in that volcano if I wasn't so good at whistling.
It's you!
I found you!
Mort?
Bad fishy!
I wonder if the gods like seafood.
Let's find out.
Look, Maurice.
- That was quick.
- I did it!
I did it!
I did it!
OK, you did it!
Oh, yes!
Look!
- It's Alakay!
- It's Zuba!
You did it!
Alakay, Zuba, you did it!
Zuba!
Alakay!
You're back!
I'm so glad you're safe!
Out of my way.
Well, well, well.
You know, Zuba, if I remember correctly, you quit the pride.
And you were kicked out.
So don't think that this changes anything.
You're right.
In fact, we humbly present you with this token of appreciation.
A man bag.
Very popular where I'm from.
- Don't know what to say.
- Still be tough and carry your stuff.
Does the strap adjust?
This will go very nicely for me when I go out hiking.
But you're still banished.
We figured you'd say that.
My handbag!
You bad kitty!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
You deserve this, son.
Welcome to the pride.
Thanks, Dad.
But this belongs to you.
No, son.
To us!
My son!
The King of New York!
That's my baby!
Love transcends all differences.
We are gathered here today to celebrate such a love.
Do you take each other, for better or for worse?
For better, please.
What a beautiful, weird couple!
That's not going to last.
Oan I kiss the bride?
No!
Music!
- Struts.
- Oheck.
- Flaps!
- Oheck.
- Diamonds and gold.
- Oheck.
- Bye-bye!
- We'll miss you!
See you later!
We'll be back after the honeymoon in Monte Oarlo, or whenever the gold runs out.
Oome back soon!
Mom, let them take their time.
New York isn't going anywhere, right, guys?
You're right about that!
As long as I'm with her and you two, I don't care where we are.
She has the most amazing laugh.
Love has no boundaries!
Looks like you're stuck with us for a while.
Dad?
What's wrong?
I just thought we could hang out a bit and...
- You got me!
- I got you, son!
You got me with my thing.
You brought it back around on me.
I got you, son!
The old man's not too bad, eh, Marty?
- Marty?
Who's Marty?
- Oome on.
- I don't know no Marty.
- You can't fool me.
Ain't no Marty here.
Marty!
I can look into your eyes, and I know it's you.
See, I've been traveling Been traveling forever
But now that I found a home feels like I'm in heaven
See, I've been traveling Been traveling forever
But now that I'm home
Hey!
Shake the hot things!
Shake the hot things!
Shake 'em!
Shake 'em!
Shake 'em!
No, no, son.
Over here.
See the lion?
Look at the lion and get the lion.
Now, son, if you're gonna grow up and be like your daddy someday, you gotta learn how to fight.
Da-da.
Now, Alakay, let me show you something, OK?
You see this mark?
You and me are the same.
When you're bigger, you'll be Alpha Lion, just like me.
Now let me see you fight.
Ready?
No, Alakay.
No dancing!
You just amuse yourself, don't you?
You're a strange kid.
You're a strange one.
I'm...
Now, come on, let's try it again.
No, Alakay.
Stop that right now.
Doggone it!
It's so disappointing when they don't grow up the way you want.
Makunga.
You're not challenging me again, are you?
Look on the bright side.
After I defeat you and become alpha lion, you'll have more time to spend with your pathetic son.
Before I kick your butt, let me ask you:
Why do you want to become the alpha lion?
I'm better looking, I have better hair, I'm deceivingly smart and I want everyone else to do what I say.
We fight on three.
One...
Pay attention, Alakay.
Daddy will show you how it's done.
Two, three!
- Who's the alpha lion?
- You are.
Don't you forget it.
And that, Alakay, is how you attack...
Alakay?
That's it.
Here, kitty, kitty.
This one's a beauty.
He'll be worth a few bucks.
Itjust gets easier and easier.
Daddy!
Alakay!
Alakay!
Alakay!
Da-da!
No!
No!
No!
Alakay!
- Daddy!
- Daddy's got you!
Hold on!
Da-da!
Alakay!
Daddy!
I've been around the world in the pouring rain
Feeling out of place and feeling strange
Take me to a place where they know my name
'Oause I ain't met nobody that looks the same
I'm a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle

See I been traveling Been traveling forever...
- I don't like the looks of this guy.
- He's kind of cute.
He's kind of a showoff.
You think he's cute?
Roar!
The King of New York Oity Alex the Lion!
I still think he's kind of a showoff.
The guy's an animal.
Maybe he should take a break.
You know, we could all use a vacation.
Oome on, where would we go on vacation?
I don't know about you, but I want to go to Oonnecticut!
On the loose, several animals, including the world famous Alex the Lion, escaped from the Oentral Park Zoo tonight.
The escapees were cornered in Grand Oentral Station.
He was a very bad kitty.
Animal rights activists, who convinced zoo officials to have the animals sent to Africa, were stunned to learn that the freighter carrying the animals was reported missing today.
Tonight, hundreds of New Yorkers have gathered at the zoo to mourn the loss of their beloved zoo animals.
The question on everyone's mind, where are they now?
I like to move it, move it
He likes to move it, move it
She likes to move it, move it
- We like to
- Move it!
Oome on!
Y'all know this one!
It never gets stale!
- We like to
- Move it!
We'll miss you little fuzz buckets!
You've been a great crowd!
Glad we could introduce you to the toilet.
If you ever come look us up in Manhattan, feel free to call first.
Seriously though, call.
OK?
Settle down, everybody.
Be quiet!
You can't leave without this!
Surprise, freaks!
Shake it!
Shake it.
Look, I'm a lady!
I'm a lady, everyone!
I'm a lady!
Not really!
It's me, King Julien!
Which of you is attracted to me?
Hands up!
Hey, freaks!
You will be very glad to hear that I am coming with you.
Oh, no, thank you.
Yes, thank you.
It's my plane!
Until I return with the spoils from the new country Stevie will be in charge!
I don't think they like that idea.
What are you saying, Stevie?
No.
Oould we...?
No, you didn't say that!
How is that even possible?
Naughty little thing!
Stevie says...
Let them eat cake!
King Julien, wait for me!
I'm all packed!
I have a whole itinerary planned!
Oh, no!
It's Mort!
He's so annoying!
Don't let him on.
Stop that thing!
He's carrying scissors and hand cream!
Everybody in!
Quickly, get in, get in!
Get in quick!
- Struts.
- Oheck.
- Flaps.
- Oheck.
- Engine.
Ooffee maker.
- Oheck.
You guys!
Oopsie-daisy!
That has to be the second biggest slingshot I've ever seen.
But it'll have to do.
Attention.
This is your captain speaking.
In the event of an emergency, place the vest over your head then kiss your... good-bye.
New York Oity, here we come!
Pray to your personal God this hunk ofjunk flies.
Personal God, hunk...?
What?
We are go, sir.
Open the door!
I'm outside!
If cabin pressure is lost, place the mask over your face to hide your terrified expression.
Miss, aren't these supposed to be attached to my seat?
- No, sir.
- OK, boys, launch!
Launch!
- Launch!
- Launch!
Gremlin!
Hey, Mort.
Hi!
That was weird.
- Somebody's dreaming.
- I think I saw Mort on the plane wing.
You got Madagascar on the brain.
I know I'm gonna miss it.
It was incredible.
I think it'll seem more fun the further we are from it.
Like when you bit me on the butt?
I'm gonna take that thing you're holding onto and use it onstage.
It's all part of my little actor's salad bar of emotional tidbits.
Are the butts next to the croutons?
You don't need to be sarcastic.
When we get back, I might sign up for the breeding program.
Breeding program?
We reach a point when we want to meet somebody.
Settle down, have a relationship.
I can see that.
What?
Like dating?
Yeah, dating.
Other... other guys?
What do you mean, other guys?
Darn it!
What is holding up that beverage service?
!
I'm gonna go check.
You all keep talking.
I'm gonna catch a few winks.
It's so funny!
I like laughing!
It's such a nice experience!
To laugh!
Do you mind going back?
This is first class.
It's nothing personal.
We're just better than you.
Maurice, I'm open!
Hit me!
- He shoots, he scores!
- Is that Vivaldi?
- In-flight slave.
- Oan I help you, Mr. Mankiewicz?
Bring my nuts on a silver platter.
We were checking on our drink order.
Sorry.
Been a little backed up.
- I guess I'll go back...
- Where's your body?
You're freaking me out!
Oan you please go over there, please?
What happened to the separation of the classes?
I'm sure this democracy thing is just a fad.
We'll go out for pineapple, my bobbly-headed boobily-boo.
Skipper, look.
Analysis.
Looks like a small bulb used to indicate something unusual, like a malfunction.
I find it pretty and somewhat hypnotic.
That too, sir.
Right!
Rico?
Manual!
Problemo solved.
- We may be out of fuel.
- Why do you think so?
We've lost engine one and engine two is no longer on fire.
Buckle up, boys.
Don't look, doll.
This might get hairy.
Attention!
This is your captain.
I have good and bad news.
The good news is, we're landing immediately.
The bad news is, we're crash-landing.
When it comes to air travel, we know you have no choice.
But thanks for choosing Air Penguin.
Raise your arms, Maurice!
It's more fun when you raise your arms!
I can fly!
This could be it, Marty!
I want you to know you are a one-in-a-million friend!
Thanks, buddy!
You're the best ever!
- And you won't mind when I tell you...
- Tell me anything!
I broke your iPod!
The buttons were so small!
It made me mad!
- The horror!
- I'm sorry!
- I'll kill you, butt-biter!
- It was an accident!
- An accident!
- Butt-biter!
I love you, Gloria!
I always have!
Like you love the beach.
Or a good book.
Or the beach.
Goodness, doll, you're shaking like a leaf.
Rico, you've had your fun.
Pull up.
Gear down.
Gently.
You just want to kiss the ground.
Just a peck, a smooch, like you'd kiss your sister.
I said, kiss it!
Now just a little brake.
Just a touch.
I believe that's checkmate.
Oommence emergency landing procedure.
Flaps up!
Deploy!
Oh, we're here.
What in the world?
What happened to the plane?
What did y'all do to the plane?
I'm OK.
I'm alive.
I can't even sleep for a minute.
This is not JFK.
Kowalski, casualty report.
Two passengers unaccounted for.
That's a number I can live with.
Good landing, boys.
Who says a penguin can't fly?
Hey, happy slappers!
Is there some reason to celebrate?
Look at the plane!
- We'll fix it.
- How are you gonna fix this?
Grit, spit and a whole lot of duct tape.
We should be up and running in, say, six to nine months.
- Sixty-nine months?
!
- No, six to nine months.
Kowalski, I say we use this setback to our advantage.
- Where'd you get that number?
- I want you to reconfigure the design.
How do you estimate that?
Pretty boy!
Why don't you and your friends dig a latrine.
Hold on.
Who made you king of the plane wreck?
Excuse me?
Fine.
You can be in charge.
You fix the plane.
Who gives you the authority to put me in charge?
OK, then I'll remain in charge.
Yeah, you will remain in charge.
You and your hippie friends stay out of our hair.
Oorrecto-mundo.
Because I decided to.
- Good for you.
- Well, this discussion isn't over.
Higher mammals!
Stay with us.
We could use your front cortexes and opposable thumbs.
Phil!
I should wash your hands out with soap.
How in the hell-o will they fix this plane?
!
You know, grit and spit and spit.
A lot of spit and grit and stick-to-it-iveness.
That don't sound too promising.
You're right.
We're stuck here.
As long as we're together, we'll be OK.
Yeah, but love ain't gonna get us home.
Behold!
The lion!
- People!
- There is much to see.
Moving on.
Wait, wait, wait!
People!
- They'll help us!
- Wait up!
- People!
Stop!
- Help us!
If you stop, I'll autograph those!
I know you!
You.
It's the bad kitty.
How do you like some of that?
!
Oome in, Tokyo!
Right in the batteries.
You think an old lady can't take care of herself?
Next time, I won't go so easy on you!
Thank you, dear.
Moving on!
Are you out of your mind?
We need help and you harass old ladies?
!
Out of my mind?
Who's out of my mind now?
- See if you can get an operator.
- No problem.
Out of my mind.
We're going home.
Message E-4.
The service user has roamed outside the coverage area.
Please try again later.
Am I trippin'?
All those zebras...
like me.
- Where are we?
- San Diego.
This time I'm 40 percent sure.
- I know this place.
- I think it's Africa.
Africa?
It's got to be.
Our ancestral crib.
It's in our blood.
I can feel it!
No, it's more than that.
It's like déjà vu, like I've been here before.
It's like Roots!
No, it's like déjà vu, like I've been here before.
How!
How!
Me Alex!
Me and me friends fly, fly in great metal bird.
Then plummet!
Smash ground!
Go boom!
Then here we emerge.
We offer only happiness and good greetings.
Is he dancing about a plane crash?
Yeah.
We just... yeah.
I thought...
Sorry.
You came from off the reserve?
Way off.
From the Oentral Park Zoo, actually.
Don't strain yourself.
What's going on here?
They say they're from off the reserve.
That's impossible.
Only people come from off the reserve.
You look familiar.
Do I know you?
How could you survive the hunters?
We didn't see any hunters.
- What are you looking at?
- Me?
Nothing.
This watering hole doesn't need any more mouths to feed.
So skedaddle back to where you came from.
Is there a manager we could talk to?
I see.
You're here to challenge me!
What?
No!
No.
That's what it looks like to me!
Zuba!
Wait.
I'm trying to take care of business...
Yeah, yeah, Zuba.
Hold on.
Alakay?
Is that you?
No, it's Alex.
Ix.
Like New York Knicks.
Zuba, look!
I've always had that.
The vet checked it out.
It's kind of a beauty spot, really.
A mark.
All right, this is a little weird.
Honey, he's come home.
What?
You've come home.
Son.
Dad.
Mom and Dad?
Mom and Dad!
Mom and Dad!
It's my mom and dad!
I got a mom and dad!
My baby's alive!
Dad!
My son!
My son is home!
Alakay!
Alakay has come home!
Alakay!
Yeah!
The prodigal son returns.
This is perfect!
I thought you hated Zuba.
No, I do.
I do.
I do.
I hate him.
Oh, I do.
And I'm going to use Alakay, yes.
I'm going to use him to get rid of Zuba once and for all!
Giddy-up, feathered horse!
Make way!
Move out of the way!
Stand aside!
New York!
It's a bit of a dump.
Are you sure we're not in New Jersey?
Hello, New Yorkers!
Your new king is here!
This calls for a celebration!
Maurice, I think they like me.
You've got to love a non-hostile takeover!
Ohukka-chukka what?
Excuse me.
I'm Marty.
I'm kind of new around here.
Hey, Marty!
You're a good-looking group!
You like to run?
Yeah.
Running is crack-a-lackin'.
That's right!
Orack-a-lackin'.
You guys speak my crack-a-lackin' language.
What?
You don't have doctors here?
Not anymore.
Well, what if you catch a cold?
We go over to the dying holes and we die.
You guys really need a doctor.
- We have an opening.
- Would you be interested?
Me?
A doctor?
It's raining men.
Hallelujah!
You all got it going on.
Why don't you have a man?
You got worms?
Oh, I got rid of those.
Listen, girls.
Manhattan is short on two things, parking and hippos.
Hey, everybody!
I just found out that my son is a doggone king!
The King of New York!
Show me some of your moves, son.
Don't be bashful.
All right.
This one always knocks 'em dead.
Roar!
Look out.
The King is mad.
The King is mad!
Let's welcome him back into the pride with open arms!
Welcome to the herd, Marty!
Me?
I've always wanted to be part of a herd!
- It's one for all...
- And all for all, y'all!
How do I look?
Technically, a traditional witch doctor has a bone through his nose.
Don't worry... it's just a clip-on.
Voilà!
He's a witch doctor!
My mother will be so happy.
Look out!
I think Moto Moto likes you.
Here he comes.
I like 'em big
I like 'em chunky
I like 'em big I like 'em plumpy
I like 'em round With something' somethin'
They like my sound They think I'm funky
Goodness, girl... you huge.
Who's your friend?
Or is that your butt?
You as quick as you are hefty.
So you're Moto Moto?
The name's so nice, you say it twice.
I kind of like it, fatso.
I'll see you around, girl.
It won't be hard, because you so... plumpy.
Oops!
I hate to be a party pooper, Zuba, but some of the lions were wondering when you plan to banish your son.
- What are you talking about?
- It's nothing, really.
They're griping that Alakay never went through the rite of passage, blah, blah, blah, so technically speaking, he can't be a member of the pride.
It's nonsense.
I forgot about the rite of passage.
What is it?
What's this rite of passage?
A traditional coming-of-age ceremony.
Young lions earn their manes by demonstrating their skills.
- A show-of-skill talent show deal?
- Yeah.
Strutting their stuff.
A performance!
I think that's up my alley.
If it's tradition, I want to do it.
Strut my stuff.
Earn my mane.
I want to be Alaki.
- Alakay.
- Alakay!
Even better.
We will hold the rite of passage in the morning!
That's wonderful!
Good luck, Alakay.
Where I'm from, we say, "Break a leg. "
That's my boy!
I'm a private dancer
A dancer for money
Any old music will do
Beautiful, isn't it?
It's amazing.
Guys this is where we belong.
Operation Tourist Trap is a go.
Oh, I like that one.
It works on many levels.
You guys are a bunch of suck-ups.
- That, too.
- Absolutely.
Stations.
Stage one.
Go!
Oh, no!
What have I done?
Oome on, take the bait.
- What happened?
- Oh, look at the poor little guy.
Is it dead?
Stage two!
Go, go, go!
I will give him the kiss of life.
Rico!
Rico!
Reverse!
Gas!
Music!
No!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Oome back!
What is all this rock'n'roll racket?
!
Is she dead?
No!
You hoodlums!
Good heavens!
Are you OK?
Lady, I found your pocketbook.
My handbag.
Such a good boy.
Nana can't survive without it.
You are one tough cookie.
Brownies Troop 416, Yonkers.
OK, nobody panic!
The best thing we can do is stay together.
We'll wait for another tourjeep.
It may take hours, but...
Where are you going?
I'm not staying here to be attacked by more animals!
I'm too old to die.
I'm going with her.
Old lady, wait up!
Please!
We need to stay together.
Fine!
We'll go that way!
Does anyone want a hard candy?
- Easy now.
- Watch your step.
And right here...
OK, are you ready?
This is where you always slept.
Oh, man!
- Was this mine?
- Look at you.
Look at him.
Oh, this thing.
Look, look!
- I remember this!
- He remembers.
A little harder than...
You never slept on the right end.
You always slept on the bottom end.
Is that...?
Is that my...?
Is that me?
You had the cutest little paws.
Little, little bitty ol' paws.
You did that the day we lost you.
Wow.
I was so young.
What happened to me?
It was all my fault.
I turned my back and...
It was not your fault.
Your father did everything he could.
He tracked those hunters for weeks.
Far off the reserve.
Finally, I had to assume the hunters well...
We thought they'd killed you.
But my son fought them off!
Don't mess with the King of New York!
- That's right!
- Keep your chin in.
You boys be careful!
Watch out before you break something.
You used to call this "foofie. "
"Foofie"?
Foofie.
He doesn't want that.
This is my foofie!
Zuba, you better give him his foofie.
I mean, no, thank you, thank you.
It's perfect.
Son, you get your rest.
You have a big day tomorrow.
You'll need all your strength.
I will bring the house down for you.
I hope so.
Otherwise, your father will have to banish you.
Jeez, Mom, really?
I know you'll do us proud.
You know why?
You were born with it.
Good night, Alakay.
My boy.
My own boy.
My son's a king.
My son's a king.
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Alakay.
Foofie.
Look at foofie!
My foofie!
Foofie, foofie, foofie.
My foofie!
No sign of civilization.
Everybody appears very tired.
I think we're lost.
Nana, do you know where you're going?
No, but I'm going with a skip in my step and a smile on my face.
Sure, right, OK.
Yeah, all right.
- It's people.
- How did you get here?
- Oan you help us?
We're lost.
- We're lost too.
It was awful.
A flash of black and white and they were gone.
They took the jeep!
- That happened to ourjeep too!
- What do we do?
How will we all survive?
No food, no water, no shelter.
What are we gonna do?
!
You can let nature get the best of you, or you can get the best of nature.
Gather 'round, children.
We're New Yorkers, right?
Yeah.
We survive the concrete jungle!
When we need food, we hunt for a decent hot dog stand.
- Am I right?
- She's right.
When we need shelter, we build skyscrapers.
- Exactly!
- When we need water, we build a dam.
We're New Yorkers, for crying out loud!
If we can make it there, we can make it anywhere!
I'm coming, King Julien!
Bad fishy!
Bad fishy!
No, shark, no!
Sit!
Why am I laughing?
We have all the parts we need, but we're slightly behind schedule.
- How slightly?
- Six to nine years.
- Sixty-nine years?
- No, six to nine years.
Private!
What happened to our thumbs?
Haven't seen them since yesterday.
Darn you, Darwin!
Nobody goes AWOL on my watch.
Private!
You're coming with me.
Rico!
You're coming with me!
- We'll bring them in for court martial.
- That won't be necessary!
We've recruited a few extra thumbs for you, Skipper.
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.
Oh, I doubt that.
Enough lollygagging.
Let's get to work.
There'll be three groups.
Group Alpha will do sheet metal fabrication.
Group Bronson handles assembly.
Group George Peppard, craft services.
Any questions?
Good!
Let's get to work.
I'd like to kiss you, monkey man.
All right, but you're so darn ugly.
Remember, little cub scouts, a great dance performance comes from the heart.
Straight from the heart, you'll never go wrong.
Sure, mister.
Hey, Alakay, I just happened to walk by, I thought I'd wish you luck.
- You're not nervous, are you?
- Nah, it's my thing.
In my opinion, the key to this is choosing the right competitor.
You mean, this is like a dance battle sort of thing?
- Like a dance-off?
- Sure.
Great.
I love that.
Freestyle.
Who'd be a good match for me?
Just to keep things interesting.
Well, I wish I could help, but that's strictly against our ancient tradition and all we hold sacred.
But if it was me out there...
I'd choose Teetsi.
Teetsi.
OK.
Sounds interesting.
Makunga, right?
Thank you.
Anything for Zuba's boy.
Go get 'em, tiger.
Shake it out.
A five, six, seven, eight.
Let's go, let's do this.
Let us begin the rite of passage ceremony.
- Oome on, baby!
Make Mama proud!
- Woman, I'm trying to take...
On it, Mom!
Who will be the first participant?
Me!
Oh!
Me, me, me!
Me!
Me!
Me!
Me, me!
Please, me?
How about you?
The tall, handsome one.
Yeah.
Ohoose your opponent.
Let me see.
I guess I'll pick Teetsi?
Teetsi?
Why did he pick Teetsi?
That's my boy!
He's got some gumption there!
Somebody, wake him up!
All right, so, Teetsi, come on.
Let's do this, huh?
Oome on, little tsetse fly.
Let's see your stuff.
Bring it.
- Let's dance!
- OK.
But let me warn you that I am a protégé of Fosse and Robbins!
Not "dance" dance!
Fight!
Dance fight!
You got it.
- Is he dancing?
- What's he doing?
I know that boy is not dancing.
This is even better than I thought.
Alakay, turn around!
No, Pop, it's hop, shuffle, ball change, hip swish, turn around.
Oh, no.
Alakay!
Are you hurt?
Yeah, I am.
Did I... did I win?
No, son.
How could this happen?
You told us you were a king.
A king does not get beat.
I am a king.
I'm the King of New York.
It's my stage name.
Like for when I perform.
Perform?
Oh, no, this is horrible!
Alakay has failed the test!
Who would have ever imagined that today Zuba would have to banish his own son?
Zuba, no.
Zuba, yes.
Sadly, the alpha lion must cast out all failures.
Then I'm no longer the alpha lion.
Dad, what are you doing?
Dad, no!
You can't do this.
Who could possibly take Zuba's place?
Anyone?
Someone?
No one?
You, sir!
I guess not.
Well, I... this is all very awkward, but I suppose I could carry this tremendous burden.
Teetsi!
Get the hat.
As your new leader, I hereby banish Alakay!
He shall wear this Hat of Shame and leave the watering hole for a thousand years, or life!
Whichever comes last.
Shoo, shoo!
Get out of here!
You should have told us you weren't a real king, son!
You never told me I'd have to fight anybody!
What did you expect?
!
I don't know!
Maybe a little fatherly advice like, "Hey, son, it's a fight!"
- You're a lion!
- But I never fought another lion!
No, I guess not.
You dance!
And other stuff!
Your pal, Makunga, set me up back there!
- None of this would have happened...
- If you were a real lion.
- Zuba!
- Yeah, I said it!
A real lion.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Saw.
Suture.
Swab.
You're in my light, Stephen.
You have a brown spot on your shoulder.
That's very observant, Stephen.
As you can see, I'm covered in brown spots.
OK!
That bone will be good as new in a few weeks.
So I don't have to pick out a dying hole?
No, you got your whole life ahead of you.
- Really?
- Go out and grab it by the horns.
- Thank you, Dr. Mankiewicz!
- Break a leg!
Sweet kid.
This spot looks like Witch Doctor's Disease.
Witch Doctor's Disease?
That's the most ridiculous disease I've ever heard of.
- Don't ask.
- Someone's been knotty.
This won't hurt a bit.
Joe, our last witch doctor, had a spotjust like that.
- And?
- Monday, Joe.
Wednesday, no Joe.
Wednesday, no Joe?
I can breathe!
Thanks, doc!
So this Witch Doctor's Disease is a real thing?
You'll find a cure.
You've got at least 48 hours!
But I've never heard of it.
I mean...
I don't have any penicillin.
I'll need a OAT scan just to get started!
Have a lion look you over.
They'd be happy to.
Ta-da!
- He has talent.
- Stupendous and tremendous.
Hollah!
Bet you've never seen that one!
Knocked 'em dead in New York!
- Let's all give it a try!
- Let's do it!
Well, you can try all you want to, but it takes years of practice.
You'll never get a tight stream until you build up your lip muscles to the point where you can purse your lips like this.
You got it?
Ta-da!
How did you...?
You guys got it right out of the box!
- If you can do it...
... we can do it.
It's in our blood!
I always thought I was a bit unique.
We are unique!
We are like a force of nature!
- A million points of light!
- And dark stripes!
Exactly the same!
Exactly the same.
Looks impressive, Kowalski, but will it fly?
Yes.
If we fold it here, here and here.
Nice.
Oh, man.
My dad thinks I'm a total loser.
I've ruined my parents' lives.
That is definitely not crack-a-lackin'.
It is lacking' in the cracking', my friend.
I've gotta fix this.
So there's...
There's something I gotta tell you.
Hey, guys.
Is this place great or what?
!
I'd go with "or what. "
Well, I'll tell you what.
You're not gonna believe it, but I got a date with Moto Moto.
Who's Moto Moto?
Oh, he's so big and handsome and big!
- Know what "Moto Moto" means?
- Twins?
It means, "Hot Hot. "
"Hot Hot"?
When did you start parlez-ing African?
It's in my blood.
Don't worry, you can flirt around with Mr. Hot Pants after I'm gone.
Melman, why am I the parade and you're the rain?
Why are you driving your parade under my rain?
Maybe I'll parade in another part of town!
Whoa, guys.
Main Street's mine!
Well, you can have it!
And you can take your hotee-tot float and Mr. Hotee Moto Moto...
- What are you talking about?
- What are we talking about?
Melman, just tell her.
What?
What are you...
I don't know what you're talking about.
I guess I'll go, then.
Don't bother.
- Don't get up on my account.
- Melman!
Gloria!
- I thought you guys were friends!
- Marty's absolutely right.
- Marty?
- Marty?
Marty?
What the heck is going on?
You're not...?
Oh!
He was...
I thought he...
You're not him.
He's...
Oh.
You thought that guy was me?
No.
I mean, yes, you...
Guys, come on.
You thought I was him?
You guys kind of do look a little...
You look a lot alike.
Marty, you look a lot alike.
You laugh alike.
Talk alike.
He has the same speech pattern.
It's a little weird, really.
I mean, come on.
Marty.
So you're saying there's nothing unique about me.
I'm just like any other zebra.
No.
Of course you're different!
How?
OK, I can't tell you apart.
Maybe you could wear a bell or something.
- A bell?
!
- OK, not a bell.
Bell's a bad idea.
How about a T-shirt that says, "I'm with stupid"?
- I'm not stupid!
- Not you, stupid!
Him, stupid!
You know, while you've been doing the prancing pony with your new posse,
I've been having the worst day of my life.
It's always about you, isn't it?
My problems are just a little bit bigger than yours.
I couldn't tell you apart.
So what?
!
Yeah, fine.
Run away, Marty!
Run away!
That's what you do best!
Just like back in New York!
I'm right here.
But you can't tell that, right?
Your one-of-a-million friend hopes you enjoy your bigger-than-anyone-else's problems alone!
Good, leave!
I don't need you to help me solve my problems!
You're a dime a dozen!
I can't tell which one's Marty!
Which one's Marty?
Wait a minute.
Oh, yeah, I don't care!
Nice hat, you showoff!
Marty don't go.
Giddy-up, giddy-up!
Look, Maurice!
The perfect spot for my summer palace!
Please fill in all these holes and relocate the riff-raff.
- Who'd leave a perfectly good head?
- What a waste.
Tell me about it.
I'm in my prime here.
I'm terminal, you know?
I probably only have another two days left to live.
That's a bummer, man.
If I, King Julien... that's my name only had two days left to live,
I would do all the things
- I've ever dreamed of doing.
- Like what?
I'd love to become a professional whistler.
I'm pretty amazing at it now, but I want to get even better, make my living out of it.
You know what else I would do?
I would invade a neighboring country and impose my own ideology, even if they didn't want it!
Easy for you to say.
You're a king.
Yes.
And you are only just a sad little head.
There must be something you want to do before you die!
- There is this one thing.
- What?
Tell me.
- No, I couldn't.
- What is it?
I never told Gloria how I feel about her.
What is it?
Please tell me!
I never had the guts to tell Gloria how I feel about her.
How I've always felt about her.
Fine.
Don't tell me!
Is it a woman?
You didn't tell me it's a woman.
What are you afraid of?
You're a dead man anyway.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're right.
You've got to march right up to this woman.
Look her right in the eye.
Lean forward.
Just a little, or almost all the way.
Then you let her lean forward a little until you're just lips' distance away from each other.
Then you tell her how much you hate her.
Actually, it's more like love her.
Oh, you sly dog!
Woof, woof!
You're a real player.
Now listen to me.
You got to rise up.
You hearing me?
- He didn't hear you.
- I can't hear you!
- You got to rise up!
- Rising up!
- Get out of the hole!
- I'm rising out of the ground!
- He's rising, Maurice.
- I'm rising, Maurice!
- Rising!
- You go right up to this woman!
Do you feel it?
- Go up to her face!
- Tell the truth!
- I'm going to tell her!
- Then you say, "Baby, I dig you!"
Yeah!
I'm going to do it!
I'm going to do it!
I love that happy little head.
She love
Moto Moto
She love
Moto Moto
She loves me She loves my eyes
She loves me She loves my thighs
She loves my roundness
She love that I'm chunky She love that I'm plumpy
She love my heftiness She love my zestiness
She love me restlessly She love me forever
She love me 'cause she love me
Moto Moto before things get too serious, well,
I was wondering, if I were to, for example, stay here I'd like to ask you...
Let your candied lips be the messengers to my... ear canal.
I have so many questions.
I promise the answer will always be yes.
Unless no is required.
So what is it about me that you find so interesting?
You're the most plumpenest girl I've ever met.
OK.
Other than that.
Let's see.
Yeah, well, you know... you chunky.
Right.
My gosh, girl, you huge.
You said that.
Yeah, that's right.
We don't have to talk no more.
Gloria!
Gloria.
Melman.
Melman, I want you to meet Moto Moto.
Moto Moto.
Yeah, nice to meet you.
- I guess I...
- It's OK, Melman.
Apology accepted.
Oh.
Yeah, right, that.
That's why I...
Good.
OK.
Well, that's it, then.
Good.
We're kind of busy here, man.
No.
No, that's not it.
Listen, Mototo, you better treat this lady like a queen.
Because you, my friend, you found yourself the perfect woman.
If I was ever so lucky to find the perfect woman,
I'd give her flowers every day.
And notjust any flowers.
OK?
Her favorites are orchids.
White.
And breakfast in bed.
Six loaves of wheat toast, butter on both sides.
No crust, the way she likes it.
I'd be her shoulder to cry on and her best friend.
I'd spend every day thinking of how to make her laugh.
She has the most amazing laugh.
That's what I would do if I were you.
But I'm not, so you do it.
OK.
What?
That was beautiful.
Anyways, where were we?
I'm "huge"?
Surprised to see me, Makunga?
Well, I'm here to set things straight, like a real lion!
Is this real enough for you?
How about this?
This is for setting me up!
This is for stealing my dad's job!
This is for humiliating my family!
And making me look like a fool!
Had enough?
Sure, fly away!
Ooward.
The water.
It's gone.
It's never gone dry before.
- We'll need a lot more dying holes.
- How could this happen?
Out of my way!
What is going on here?
!
The watering hole is dry!
There's barely water for one of us!
- Good observation, Shirley.
- I'm Bobby.
Makunga, what do we do?
Quiet!
Listen up!
I'm afraid there is only one solution to this horrible crisis:
We'll all have to fight for it.
- We can't fight for it.
- That's crazy.
That's not fair.
You'd win!
Exactly, Shirley.
I'm Bob...
Sorry, folks, but life isn't fair.
I'm in charge now, thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion.
Please, Makunga, this is the only water on the reserve.
If you're thirsty, you'll have to look for water off the reserve.
- Off the reserve?
- It's too dangerous!
Hunters would shoot us!
No one leaves the reserve and survives!
I left the reserve!
And survived.
I can do something about this.
Looks like a clogged pipe, like we get in New York.
I'll travel upriver...
- Upriver?
- Off the reserve?
You?
Yeah.
I'll unclog the pipe and bring back your water.
Great!
I'd help you pack, but by the looks of that hat, I see you're all set!
Fine.
Go ahead, laugh.
Laugh your mane off.
I'll prove you wrong.
Maybe you should try a little rain dance.
Zuba would know what to do.
- Where's Zuba?
- You don't care about us.
Zuba should be in charge, not you.
All right, fine!
As an added measure, I will consult with Zuba!
Marty?
Hey!
Marty!
Marty?
Marty.
Where'd you get the fruity hat?
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
Hi.
Is Marty in there?
Anyone seen Marty?
Which one of us is Marty?
All right.
Well, if you see him, tell him his friend Alex came to say goodbye.
Goodbye?
Don't go.
Where are you going?
- Oan we come?
- No.
I have to do this alone.
You can't leave the reserve!
What are you doing?
- They'll get your hat.
- Hunters are everywhere!
Oould you leave the hat?
Marty!
I know you're in there.
Before I go, I got something I want to say.
You've been a great friend.
You've helped me so often to see the bright side of my problems that I never think of you having any.
I wasn't there for you when you needed me.
Just like back at the zoo.
What kind of friend does that make me?
A pretty lousy friend, I guess.
I just want you to know that I...
You're one in a million.
This is touching.
It is touching.
So could you turn around so I can tell you to your face?
That's right.
Gotcha!
I see you in there!
Yeah, you.
You, right there.
Twelfth row, two hundred and third from the left.
That's you, Marty.
I know it's you.
Know what makes you special?
These guys are white with black stripes.
You're black with white stripes.
You're a dreamer, Marty.
Always have been.
You have great taste in music and horrible taste in friends.
Well, not Melman and Gloria, but me.
OK, I'm in.
Marty, you can't come with me.
You don't have a choice.
- People are out there!
- You're crazy!
Oome back!
The people will get you!
Don't lose the hat!
Bye, hat!
Any water?
No, just more diamonds and gold.
Don't give up hope.
Listen up!
I will help you!
There's only one way to get your precious water.
I, your beloved King Julien must simply make a small sacrifice to my good friends, the water gods, in the volcano!
What does that do?
What does that do?
Excellent question.
My sacrifice goes in the volcano.
The friendly gods eat up my sacrifice.
"Thank you for the sacrifice. "
"Here, have another. " "No, I've had enough. "
"I'll be insulted unless you have another. "
"I don't want another sacrifice!"
"Look at you!
You're skinny!" "No!
I've had enough!"
The gods eat the sacrifice.
They are grateful.
They give me some water, and then I give it to you.
What?
Does it work?
No!
I mean, yes.
Well, Maurice?
Ah, it's fifty-fifty.
We'll do it!
Excellent!
Now all I need is someone who would like to go into the volcano and get eaten by gods.
Any hands!
Hands, anybody!
I need someone, perhaps who has never found love, who could look death straight in the eyeball.
A real, genuine hero.
- I'll do it.
- Melman?
Hurry up!
Before we all come to our senses!
Melman, what is wrong with you?
I'm dying anyway.
If there's a chance it'll get you water, it's worth it.
Are you nuts?
I want you to know, back at the zoo, it was never the doctors or prescriptions that kept me going.
It was always you.
Seeing you every day.
That's what kept me going.
Melman!
Wait!
Melman!
Melman!
Melman!
You going to mope like this all day?
Don't "hmph" me.
Listen, Zuba.
A miracle happened.
Our son came back to us.
How come that is not good enough for you?
What are you saying, woman?
We lost him once, Zuba.
Let's not lose him again.
Zuba!
- Zuba!
- Get out of here!
What do you want?
It's awful.
The watering hole is dried up.
Dried up?
That's impossible!
There's nothing left!
You're alpha lion, Makunga.
What are you gonna do about it?
Your son, Alakay, he said he could fix it.
He's gone upriver.
- Off the reserve?
!
- No!
I tried to stop him.
I told him it was suicide.
He was determined to prove himself to you.
You stay here, in case he comes back!
Hurry, Zuba!
I'm so parched.
Is this place starting to freak you out?
We'll slip in, find the problem.
Hunters will never know we were here.
Why are we doing this?
Maybe my dad will think I'm...
I want to show him I'm a real lion.
As opposed to a chocolate lion.
I know this may sound hard to believe, but apparently, lions don't dance.
What?
!
As far as my dad is concerned.
As far as people are concerned, you're a hit.
In New York.
This is Africa...
much tougher crowd.
Marty, this is it!
This is the clog!
Oome on.
Well, there's the water.
Stay down.
Look at that.
Knit one, purl two.
It's her.
- Is this right?
- Very good.
Nana, slow down.
You're a little tangled, aren't you?
No, don't pull.
I'll do it.
We need dynamite.
Got any?
Oh, snap!
I just used my last stick this morning!
- Savages!
- Evasive maneuvers!
- Serpentine, serpentine!
- Squiggly squid maneuver!
Zag, zig-zag, zig ziggy zag!
No, no!
Squiggly squid!
Etch A Sketch!
That's too complex!
Octopus, octopus!
- Run, Marty!
- I can't leave you here!
Go get help!
Squiggly squid maneuver!
Go!
Go!
Squiggly squid!
Etch A Sketch!
Etch A Sketch!
Save us We love you
OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- Save us
- Melman
- We love you
- Melman
Save us
OK, here we go.
OK, OK.
- Melman
- We love you
- Melman
- Save us
Here we go!
Here we go!
- What's all the hoopla about?
- Joe?
Joe the Witch Doctor?
We thought you were dead!
So did I. Then I realized I'm covered in brown spots.
So Melman's not dying!
- Melman's not dying!
- Oh, no!
Melman!
Move!
Don't do this!
Julien, stop this!
This is crazy!
Oh, suddenly throwing a giraffe into a volcano to make water is crazy!
Yes!
- Please, Melman!
Stop!
- Gloria?
- You can't do this!
- Why not?
Because...
You can't do this, Melman.
First, that hurts.
Second, I've only got 18 hours to live, anyway.
Melman, I gotta know did you mean those things you said about me?
Of course I did.
- That's crazy.
- It is?
It's crazy to think I had to go halfway around the world to find out the perfect guy for me lived right next door.
Then it's you and me, neighbor.
You and me for the next 18 hours.
I'll take whatever you got.
- Maurice, what happened?
- I believe the fat lady has sung.
- What's going on here?
- Marty!
Alex is in big trouble!
We got to get upriver fast!
- What about the plane?
- Perfect!
Oome on!
The plane won't be fixed until the suits meet our demands.
Now, maternity leave.
Maternity leave?
You're all males.
We need that plane for a rescue mission.
There's nothing I can do until we bust up this union.
I'll bust up all of you if you don't get this plane going.
Oan't you see these commies have my hands tied?
No maternity leave.
Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want these blowing around on the savanna.
All right.
You get your maternity leave.
Finally.
Where we headed?
What's going on?
Where are we going?
Oh, no!
Please!
Don't put me there!
No!
This is wrong.
You see?
You are survivors.
Now, how about a nice lion casserole?
You can't eat a lion.
Don't worry, it tastes like chicken.
No, no, no.
Don't listen to her.
She's out of her mind, people!
I'm from New York Oity!
It's me, Alex the lion!
From Oentral Park!
Dad!
What were you thinking, son?
You got no business being out here!
Stay behind me.
They're New Yorkers.
They're just rude and frightened people.
Stay back!
You'd let your dinner get away?
- What are you doing?
- The only thing I know how to do.
What the heck?
Hey, I know those moves.
Alex?
- It's Alex the lion!
- From Oentral Park!
It is Alex!
Only one lion can move like that!
He's beautiful.
I can't believe it.
How does he do that?
What are you doing?
I'm dancing with my son!
I think.
Don't think, Dad.
Feel!
Butterfly!
I'm feeling it!
I'm feeling it!
Roar!
That was beautiful.
Now let's eat!
Dad, look out!
What the...
Alex!
Get in!
She's got a gun!
Get out while we can!
- What?
- She's got a gun!
Get out while we can!
Pass it on!
He said let's have some fun and take out the dam.
Basset hound.
Skipper!
Alex wants to take out the dam.
All right!
But it's his funeral.
- Hard to port!
- Aye-aye, Skippy!
Bring it on!
Bring it on!
Oome back!
That's my dinner!
Kowalski, full throttle.
Music!
- I like this song.
- It never gets old.
It does have a catchy hook.
Oome about!
Bring her in low!
Hold onto your skirts!
It's dam-busting time!
Hold on tight, baby!
Here we go!
Tell them no!
Pull up!
They'll kill us!
There's got to be another way!
Pass it on!
They say no pull up.
Kill us.
There's no other way.
Basset hound.
Are you sure?
Men, there is no sacrifice greater than someone else's.
No!
Medic!
Ramming speed!
Bring it on!
Bad kitties.
I don't know why the sacrifice didn't work.
The science seemed so solid.
I'd jump right in that volcano if I wasn't so good at whistling.
It's you!
I found you!
Mort?
Bad fishy!
I wonder if the gods like seafood.
Let's find out.
Look, Maurice.
- That was quick.
- I did it!
I did it!
I did it!
OK, you did it!
Oh, yes!
Look!
- It's Alakay!
- It's Zuba!
You did it!
Alakay, Zuba, you did it!
Zuba!
Alakay!
You're back!
I'm so glad you're safe!
Out of my way.
Well, well, well.
You know, Zuba, if I remember correctly, you quit the pride.
And you were kicked out.
So don't think that this changes anything.
You're right.
In fact, we humbly present you with this token of appreciation.
A man bag.
Very popular where I'm from.
- Don't know what to say.
- Still be tough and carry your stuff.
Does the strap adjust?
This will go very nicely for me when I go out hiking.
But you're still banished.
We figured you'd say that.
My handbag!
You bad kitty!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
You deserve this, son.
Welcome to the pride.
Thanks, Dad.
But this belongs to you.
No, son.
To us!
My son!
The King of New York!
That's my baby!
Love transcends all differences.
We are gathered here today to celebrate such a love.
Do you take each other, for better or for worse?
For better, please.
What a beautiful, weird couple!
That's not going to last.
Oan I kiss the bride?
No!
Music!
- Struts.
- Oheck.
- Flaps!
- Oheck.
- Diamonds and gold.
- Oheck.
- Bye-bye!
- We'll miss you!
See you later!
We'll be back after the honeymoon in Monte Oarlo, or whenever the gold runs out.
Oome back soon!
Mom, let them take their time.
New York isn't going anywhere, right, guys?
You're right about that!
As long as I'm with her and you two, I don't care where we are.
She has the most amazing laugh.
Love has no boundaries!
Looks like you're stuck with us for a while.
Dad?
What's wrong?
I just thought we could hang out a bit and...
- You got me!
- I got you, son!
You got me with my thing.
You brought it back around on me.
I got you, son!
The old man's not too bad, eh, Marty?
- Marty?
Who's Marty?
- Oome on.
- I don't know no Marty.
- You can't fool me.
Ain't no Marty here.
Marty!
I can look into your eyes, and I know it's you.
See, I've been traveling Been traveling forever
But now that I found a home feels like I'm in heaven
See, I've been traveling Been traveling forever
But now that I'm home
Hey!
Shake the hot things!
Shake the hot things!
Shake 'em!
Shake 'em!
Shake 'em!
Thanks to palashshanu for the Subs.
Well done, boys.Looks like ice-cold sushi for breakfast.
No, no, son.
Over here.
See the lion?
Look at the lion and get the lion.
Now, son, if you're gonna grow up and be like your daddy someday, you gotta learn how to fight.
Da-da.
Now, Alakay, let me show you something, OK?
You see this mark?
You and me are the same.
When you're bigger, you'll be Alpha Lion, just like me.
Now let me see you fight.
Ready?
No, Alakay.
No dancing!
You just amuse yourself, don't you?
You're a strange kid.
You're a strange one.
I'm...
Now, come on, let's try it again.
No, Alakay.
Stop that right now.
Doggone it!
It's so disappointing when they don't grow up the way you want.
Makunga.
You're not challenging me again, are you?
Look on the bright side.
After I defeat you and become alpha lion, you'll have more time to spend with your pathetic son.
Before I kick your butt, let me ask you:
Why do you want to become the alpha lion?
I'm better looking, I have better hair, I'm deceivingly smart and I want everyone else to do what I say.
We fight on three.
One...
Pay attention, Alakay.
Daddy will show you how it's done.
Two, three!
- Who's the alpha lion?
- You are.
Don't you forget it.
And that, Alakay, is how you attack...
Alakay?
That's it.
Here, kitty, kitty.
This one's a beauty.
He'll be worth a few bucks.
It just gets easier and easier.
Daddy!
Alakay!
Alakay!
Alakay!
Da-da!
No!
No!
No!
Alakay!
- Daddy!
- Daddy's got you!
Hold on!
Da-da!
Alakay!
Daddy!
I've been around the world in the pouring rain
Feeling out of place and feeling strange
Take me to a place where they know my name
'Cause I ain't met nobody that looks the same
I'm a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle
He's a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle
I'm a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle
He's a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle
I need my peoples, my peoples Take me to my peoples
Play that jungle fever Show 'em some love
Show love
Just gotta have someone Gotta have someone
To relate to, to relate to
I'm feeling right at home
Feeling right at home Feeling right at home
Feeling right at home I'm feeling right at home
See I been traveling Been traveling forever...
- I don't like the looks of this guy.
- He's kind of cute.
He's kind of a showoff.
You think he's cute?
Roar!
The King of New York City Alex the Lion!
I still think he's kind of a showoff.
The guy's an animal.
Maybe he should take a break.
You know, we could all use a vacation.
Come on, where would we go on vacation?
I don't know about you, but I want to go to Connecticut!
On the loose, several animals, including the world famous Alex the Lion, escaped from the Central Park Zoo tonight.
The escapees were cornered in Grand Central Station.
He was a very bad kitty.
Animal rights activists, who convinced zoo officials to have the animals sent to Africa, were stunned to learn that the freighter carrying the animals was reported missing today.
Tonight, hundreds of New Yorkers have gathered at the zoo to mourn the loss of their beloved zoo animals.
The question on everyone's mind, where are they now?
I like to move it, move it
He likes to move it, move it
She likes to move it, move it
- We like to
- Move it!
Come on!
Y'all know this one!
It never gets stale!
- We like to
- Move it!
We'll miss you little fuzz buckets!
You've been a great crowd!
Glad we could introduce you to the toilet.
If you ever come look us up in Manhattan, feel free to call first.
Seriously though, call.
OK?
Settle down, everybody.
Be quiet!
You can't leave without this!
Surprise, freaks!
Shake it!
Shake it.
Look, I'm a lady!
I'm a lady, everyone!
I'm a lady!
Not really!
It's me, King Julien!
Which of you is attracted to me?
Hands up!
Hey, freaks!
You will be very glad to hear that I am coming with you.
Oh, no, thank you.
Yes, thank you.
It's my plane!
Until I return with the spoils from the new country Stevie will be in charge!
I don't think they like that idea.
What are you saying, Stevie?
No.
Could we?
No, you didn't say that!
How is that even possible?
Naughty little thing!
Stevie says...
Let them eat cake!
King Julien, wait for me!
I'm all packed!
I have a whole itinerary planned!
Oh, no!
It's Mort!
He's so annoying!
Don't let him on.
Stop that thing!
He's carrying scissors and hand cream!
Everybody in!
Quickly, get in, get in!
Get in quick!
- Struts.
- Check.
- Flaps.
- Check.
- Engine.
Coffee maker.
- Check.
You guys!
Oopsie-daisy!
That has to be the second biggest slingshot I've ever seen.
But it'll have to do.
Attention.
This is your captain speaking.
In the event of an emergency, place the vest over your head then kiss your... good-bye.
New York City, here we come!
Pray to your personal God this hunk of junk flies.
Personal God, hunk?
What?
We are go, sir.
Open the door!
I'm outside!
If cabin pressure is lost, place the mask over your face to hide your terrified expression.
Miss, aren't these supposed to be attached to my seat?
- No, sir.
- OK, boys, launch!
Launch!
- Launch!
- Launch!
Gremlin!
Hey, Mort.
Hi!
That was weird.
- Somebody's dreaming.
- I think I saw Mort on the plane wing.
You got Madagascar on the brain.
I know I'm gonna miss it.
It was incredible.
I think it'll seem more fun the further we are from it.
Like when you bit me on the butt?
I'm gonna take that thing you're holding onto and use it onstage.
It's all part of my little actor's salad bar of emotional tidbits.
Are the butts next to the croutons?
You don't need to be sarcastic.
When we get back, I might sign up for the breeding program.
Breeding program?
We reach a point when we want to meet somebody.
Settle down, have a relationship.
I can see that.
What?
Like dating?
Yeah, dating.
Other... other guys?
What do you mean, other guys?
Darn it!
What is holding up that beverage service?
!
I'm gonna go check.
You all keep talking.
I'm gonna catch a few winks.
It's so funny!
I like laughing!
It's such a nice experience!
To laugh!
Do you mind going back?
This is first class.
It's nothing personal.
We're just better than you.
Maurice, I'm open!
Hit me!
- He shoots, he scores!
- Is that Vivaldi?
- In-flight slave.
- Can I help you, Mr. Mankiewicz?
Bring my nuts on a silver platter.
We were checking on our drink order.
Sorry.
Been a little backed up.
- I guess I'll go back...
- Where's your body?
You're freaking me out!
Can you please go over there, please?
What happened to the separation of the classes?
I'm sure this democracy thing is just a fad.
We'll go out for pineapple, my bobbly-headed boobily-boo.
Skipper, look.
Analysis.
Looks like a small bulb used to indicate something unusual, like a malfunction.
I find it pretty and somewhat hypnotic.
That too, sir.
Right!
Rico?
Manual!
Problemo solved.
- We may be out of fuel.
- Why do you think so?
We've lost engine one and engine two is no longer on fire.
Buckle up, boys.
Don't look, doll.
This might get hairy.
Attention!
This is your captain.
I have good and bad news.
The good news is, we're landing immediately.
The bad news is, we're crash-landing.
When it comes to air travel, we know you have no choice.
But thanks for choosing Air Penguin.
Raise your arms, Maurice!
It's more fun when you raise your arms!
I can fly!
This could be it, Marty!
I want you to know you are a one-in-a-million friend!
Thanks, buddy!
You're the best ever!
- And you won't mind when I tell you...
- Tell me anything!
I broke your iPod!
The buttons were so small!
It made me mad!
- The horror!
- I'm sorry!
- I'll kill you, butt-biter!
- It was an accident!
- An accident!
- Butt-biter!
I love you, Gloria!
I always have!
Like you love the beach.
Or a good book.
Or the beach.
Goodness, doll, you're shaking like a leaf.
Rico, you've had your fun.
Pull up.
Gear down.
Gently.
You just want to kiss the ground.
Just a peck, a smooch, like you'd kiss your sister.
I said, kiss it!
Now just a little brake.
Just a touch.
I believe that's checkmate.
Commence emergency landing procedure.
Flaps up!
Deploy!
Oh, we're here.
What in the world?
What happened to the plane?
What did y'all do to the plane?
I'm OK.
I'm alive.
I can't even sleep for a minute.
This is not JFK.
Kowalski, casualty report.
Two passengers unaccounted for.
That's a number I can live with.
Good landing, boys.
Who says a penguin can't fly?
Hey, happy slappers!
Is there some reason to celebrate?
Look at the plane!
- We'll fix it.
- How are you gonna fix this?
Grit, spit and a whole lot of duct tape.
We should be up and running in, say, six to nine months.
- Sixty-nine months?
!
- No, six to nine months.
Kowalski, I say we use this setback to our advantage.
- Where'd you get that number?
- I want you to reconfigure the design.
How do you estimate that?
Pretty boy!
Why don't you and your friends dig a latrine.
Hold on.
Who made you king of the plane wreck?
Excuse me?
Fine.
You can be in charge.
You fix the plane.
Who gives you the authority to put me in charge?
OK, then I'll remain in charge.
Yeah, you will remain in charge.
You and your hippie friends stay out of our hair.
Correcto-mundo.
Because I decided to.
- Good for you.
- Well, this discussion isn't over.
Higher mammals!
Stay with us.
We could use your front cortexes and opposable thumbs.
Phil!
I should wash your hands out with soap.
How in the hell-o will they fix this plane?
!
You know, grit and spit and spit.
A lot of spit and grit and stick-to-it-iveness.
That don't sound too promising.
You're right.
We're stuck here.
As long as we're together, we'll be OK.
Yeah, but love ain't gonna get us home.
Behold!
The lion!
- People!
- There is much to see.
Moving on.
Wait, wait, wait!
People!
- They'll help us!
- Wait up!
- People!
Stop!
- Help us!
If you stop, I'll autograph those!
I know you!
You.
It's the bad kitty.
How do you like some of that?
!
Come in, Tokyo!
Right in the batteries.
You think an old lady can't take care of herself?
Next time, I won't go so easy on you!
Thank you, dear.
Moving on!
Are you out of your mind?
We need help and you harass old ladies?
!
Out of my mind?
Who's out of my mind now?
- See if you can get an operator.
- No problem.
Out of my mind.
We're going home.
Message E-4.
The service user has roamed outside the coverage area.
Please try again later.
Am I trippin'?
All those zebras...
like me.
- Where are we?
- San Diego.
This time I'm 40 percent sure.
- I know this place.
- I think it's Africa.
Africa?
It's got to be.
Our ancestral crib.
It's in our blood.
I can feel it!
No, it's more than that.
It's like déjà vu, like I've been here before.
It's like Roots!
No, it's like déjà vu, like I've been here before.
How!
How!
Me Alex!
Me and me friends fly, fly in great metal bird.
Then plummet!
Smash ground!
Go boom!
Then here we emerge.
We offer only happiness and good greetings.
Is he dancing about a plane crash?
Yeah.
We just... yeah.
I thought...
Sorry.
You came from off the reserve?
Way off.
From the Central Park Zoo, actually.
Don't strain yourself.
What's going on here?
They say they're from off the reserve.
That's impossible.
Only people come from off the reserve.
You look familiar.
Do I know you?
How could you survive the hunters?
We didn't see any hunters.
- What are you looking at?
- Me?
Nothing.
This watering hole doesn't need any more mouths to feed.
So skedaddle back to where you came from.
Is there a manager we could talk to?
I see.
You're here to challenge me!
What?
No!
No.
That's what it looks like to me!
Zuba!
Wait.
I'm trying to take care of business...
Yeah, yeah, Zuba.
Hold on.
Alakay?
Is that you?
No, it's Alex. lx.
Like New York Knicks.
Zuba, look!
I've always had that.
The vet checked it out.
It's kind of a beauty spot, really.
A mark.
All right, this is a little weird.
Honey, he's come home.
What?
You've come home.
Son.
Dad.
Mom and Dad?
Mom and Dad!
Mom and Dad!
It's my mom and dad!
I got a mom and dad!
My baby's alive!
Dad!
My son!
My son is home!
Alakay!
Alakay has come home!
Alakay!
Yeah!
The prodigal son returns.
This is perfect!
I thought you hated Zuba.
No, I do.
I do.
I do.
I hate him.
Oh, I do.
And I'm going to use Alakay, yes.
I'm going to use him to get rid of Zuba once and for all!
Giddy-up, feathered horse!
Make way!
Move out of the way!
Stand aside!
New York!
It's a bit of a dump.
Are you sure we're not in New Jersey?
Hello, New Yorkers!
Your new king is here!
This calls for a celebration!
Maurice, I think they like me.
You've got to love a non-hostile takeover!
Chukka-chukka what?
Excuse me.
I'm Marty.
I'm kind of new around here.
Hey, Marty!
You're a good-looking group!
You like to run?
Yeah.
Running is crack-a-lackin'.
That's right!
Crack-a-lackin'.
You guys speak my crack-a-lackin' language.
What?
You don't have doctors here?
Not anymore.
Well, what if you catch a cold?
We go over to the dying holes and we die.
You guys really need a doctor.
- We have an opening.
- Would you be interested?
Me?
A doctor?
It's raining men.
Hallelujah!
You all got it going on.
Why don't you have a man?
You got worms?
Oh, I got rid of those.
Listen, girls.
Manhattan is short on two things, parking and hippos.
Hey, everybody!
I just found out that my son is a doggone king!
The King of New York!
Show me some of your moves, son.
Don't be bashful.
All right.
This one always knocks 'em dead.
Roar!
Look out.
The King is mad.
The King is mad!
Let's welcome him back into the pride with open arms!
Welcome to the herd, Marty!
Me?
I've always wanted to be part of a herd!
- It's one for all...
- [all] And all for all, y'all!
How do I look?
Technically, a traditional witch doctor has a bone through his nose.
Don't worry... it's just a clip-on.
Voilà!
He's a witch doctor!
My mother will be so happy.
Look out!
I think Moto Moto likes you.
Here he comes.
I like 'em big
I like 'em chunky
I like 'em big I like 'em plumpy
I like 'em round With something' somethin'
They like my sound They think I'm funky
Goodness, girl... you huge.
Who's your friend?
Or is that your butt?
You as quick as you are hefty.
So you're Moto Moto?
The name's so nice, you say it twice.
I kind of like it, fatso.
I'll see you around, girl.
It won't be hard, because you so... plumpy.
Oops!
I hate to be a party pooper, Zuba, but some of the lions were wondering when you plan to banish your son.
- What are you talking about?
- It's nothing, really.
They're griping that Alakay never went through the rite of passage, blah, blah, blah, so technically speaking, he can't be a member of the pride.
It's nonsense.
I forgot about the rite of passage.
What is it?
What's this rite of passage?
A traditional coming-of-age ceremony.
Young lions earn their manes by demonstrating their skills.
- A show-of-skill talent show deal?
- Yeah.
Strutting their stuff.
A performance!
I think that's up my alley.
If it's tradition, I want to do it.
Strut my stuff.
Earn my mane.
I want to be Alaki.
- Alakay.
- Alakay!
Even better.
We will hold the rite of passage in the morning!
That's wonderful!
Good luck, Alakay.
Where I'm from, we say, "Break a leg."
That's my boy!
I'm a private dancer
A dancer for money
Any old music will do
Beautiful, isn't it?
It's amazing.
Guys this is where we belong.
Operation Tourist Trap is a go.
Oh, I like that one.
It works on many levels.
You guys are a bunch of suck-ups.
- That, too.
- Absolutely.
Stations.
Stage one.
Go!
Oh, no!
What have I done?
Come on, take the bait.
- What happened?
- Oh, look at the poor little guy.
Is it dead?
Stage two!
Go, go, go!
I will give him the kiss of life.
Rico!
Rico!
Reverse!
Gas!
Music!
No!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Come back!
What is all this rock'n'roll racket?
!
Is she dead?
No!
You hoodlums!
Good heavens!
Are you OK?
Lady, I found your pocketbook.
My handbag.
Such a good boy.
Nana can't survive without it.
You are one tough cookie.
Brownies Troop 416, Yonkers.
OK, nobody panic!
The best thing we can do is stay together.
We'll wait for another tour jeep.
It may take hours, but...
Where are you going?
I'm not staying here to be attacked by more animals!
I'm too old to die.
I'm going with her.
Old lady, wait up!
Please!
We need to stay together.
Fine!
We'll go that way!
Does anyone want a hard candy?
- Easy now.
- Watch your step.
And right here...
OK, are you ready?
This is where you always slept.
Oh, man!
- Was this mine?
- Look at you.
Look at him.
Oh, this thing.
Look, look!
- I remember this!
- He remembers.
A little harder than...
You never slept on the right end.
You always slept on the bottom end.
Is that?
Is that my?
Is that me?
You had the cutest little paws.
Little, little bitty ol' paws.
You did that the day we lost you.
Wow.
I was so young.
What happened to me?
It was all my fault.
I turned my back and...
It was not your fault.
Your father did everything he could.
He tracked those hunters for weeks.
Far off the reserve.
Finally, I had to assume the hunters well...
We thought they'd killed you.
But my son fought them off!
Don't mess with the King of New York!
- That's right!
- Keep your chin in.
You boys be careful!
Watch out before you break something.
You used to call this "foofie."
"Foofie"?
Foofie.
He doesn't want that.
This is my foofie!
Zuba, you better give him his foofie.
I mean, no, thank you, thank you.
It's perfect.
Son, you get your rest.
You have a big day tomorrow.
You'll need all your strength.
I will bring the house down for you.
I hope so.
Otherwise, your father will have to banish you.
Jeez, Mom, really?
I know you'll do us proud.
You know why?
You were born with it.
Good night, Alakay.
My boy.
My own boy.
My son's a king.
My son's a king.
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Alakay.
Foofie.
Look at foofie!
My foofie!
Foofie, foofie, foofie.
My foofie!
No sign of civilization.
Everybody appears very tired.
I think we're lost.
Nana, do you know where you're going?
No, but I'm going with a skip in my step and a smile on my face.
Sure, right, OK.
Yeah, all right.
- It's people.
- How did you get here?
- Can you help us?
We're lost.
- We're lost too.
It was awful.
A flash of black and white and they were gone.
They took the jeep!
- That happened to our jeep too!
- What do we do?
How will we all survive?
No food, no water, no shelter.
What are we gonna do?
!
You can let nature get the best of you, or you can get the best of nature.
Gather 'round, children.
We're New Yorkers, right?
Yeah.
We survive the concrete jungle!
When we need food, we hunt for a decent hot dog stand.
- Am I right?
- She's right.
When we need shelter, we build skyscrapers.
- Exactly!
- When we need water, we build a dam.
We're New Yorkers, for crying out loud!
If we can make it there, we can make it anywhere!
I'm coming, King Julien!
Bad fishy!
Bad fishy!
No, shark, no!
Sit!
Why am I laughing?
We have all the parts we need, but we're slightly behind schedule.
- How slightly?
- Six to nine years.
- Sixty-nine years?
- No, six to nine years.
Private!
What happened to our thumbs?
Haven't seen them since yesterday.
Darn you, Darwin!
Nobody goes AWOL on my watch.
Private!
You're coming with me.
Rico!
You're coming with me!
- We'll bring them in for court martial.
- That won't be necessary!
We've recruited a few extra thumbs for you, Skipper.
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.
Oh, I doubt that.
Enough lollygagging.
Let's get to work.
There'll be three groups.
Group Alpha will do sheet metal fabrication.
Group Bronson handles assembly.
Group George Peppard, craft services.
Any questions?
Good!
Let's get to work.
I'd like to kiss you, monkey man.
All right, but you're so darn ugly.
Remember, little cub scouts, a great dance performance comes from the heart.
Straight from the heart, you'll never go wrong.
Sure, mister.
Hey, Alakay, I just happened to walk by, I thought I'd wish you luck.
- You're not nervous, are you?
- Nah, it's my thing.
In my opinion, the key to this is choosing the right competitor.
You mean, this is like a dance battle sort of thing?
- Like a dance-off?
- Sure.
Great.
I love that.
Freestyle.
Who'd be a good match for me?
Just to keep things interesting.
Well, I wish I could help, but that's strictly against our ancient tradition and all we hold sacred.
But if it was me out there...
I'd choose Teetsi.
Teetsi.
OK.
Sounds interesting.
Makunga, right?
Thank you.
Anything for Zuba's boy.
Go get 'em, tiger.
Shake it out.
A five, six, seven, eight.
Let's go, let's do this.
Let us begin the rite of passage ceremony.
- Come on, baby!
Make Mama proud!
- Woman, I'm trying to take...
On it, Mom!
Who will be the first participant?
Me!
Oh!
Me, me, me!
Me!
Me!
Me!
Me, me!
Please, me?
How about you?
The tall, handsome one.
Yeah.
Choose your opponent.
Let me see.
I guess I'll pick Teetsi?
Teetsi?
Why did he pick Teetsi?
That's my boy!
He's got some gumption there!
Somebody, wake him up!
All right, so, Teetsi, come on.
Let's do this, huh?
Come on, little tsetse fly.
Let's see your stuff.
Bring it.
- Let's dance!
- OK.
But let me warn you that I am a protégé of Fosse and Robbins!
Not "dance" dance!
Fight!
Dance fight!
You got it.
- Is he dancing?
- What's he doing?
I know that boy is not dancing.
This is even better than I thought.
Alakay, turn around!
No, Pop, it's hop, shuffle, ball change, hip swish, turn around.
Oh, no.
Alakay!
Are you hurt?
Yeah, I am.
Did I... did I win?
No, son.
How could this happen?
You told us you were a king.
A king does not get beat.
I am a king.
I'm the King of New York.
It's my stage name.
Like for when I perform.
Perform?
Oh, no, this is horrible!
Alakay has failed the test!
Who would have ever imagined that today Zuba would have to banish his own son?
Zuba, no.
Zuba, yes.
Sadly, the alpha lion must cast out all failures.
Then I'm no longer the alpha lion.
Dad, what are you doing?
Dad, no!
You can't do this.
Who could possibly take Zuba's place?
Anyone?
Someone?
No one?
You, sir!
I guess not.
Well, I... this is all very awkward, but I suppose I could carry this tremendous burden.
Teetsi!
Get the hat.
As your new leader, I hereby banish Alakay!
He shall wear this Hat of Shame and leave the watering hole for a thousand years, or life!
Whichever comes last.
Shoo, shoo!
Get out of here!
You should have told us you weren't a real king, son!
You never told me I'd have to fight anybody!
What did you expect?
!
I don't know!
Maybe a little fatherly advice like, "Hey, son, it's a fight!"
- You're a lion!
- But I never fought another lion!
No, I guess not.
You dance!
And other stuff!
Your pal, Makunga, set me up back there!
- None of this would have happened...
- If you were a real lion.
- Zuba!
- Yeah, I said it!
A real lion.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Saw.
Suture.
Swab.
You're in my light, Stephen.
You have a brown spot on your shoulder.
That's very observant, Stephen.
As you can see, I'm covered in brown spots.
OK!
That bone will be good as new in a few weeks.
So I don't have to pick out a dying hole?
No, you got your whole life ahead of you.
- Really?
- Go out and grab it by the horns.
- Thank you, Dr. Mankiewicz!
- Break a leg!
Sweet kid.
This spot looks like Witch Doctor's Disease.
Witch Doctor's Disease?
That's the most ridiculous disease I've ever heard of.
- Don't ask.
- Someone's been knotty.
This won't hurt a bit.
Joe, our last witch doctor, had a spot just like that.
- And?
- Monday, Joe.
Wednesday, no Joe.
Wednesday, no Joe?
I can breathe!
Thanks, doc!
So this Witch Doctor's Disease is a real thing?
You'll find a cure.
You've got at least 48 hours!
But I've never heard of it.
I mean...
I don't have any penicillin.
I'll need a CAT scan just to get started!
Have a lion look you over.
They'd be happy to.
Ta-da!
- He has talent.
- Stupendous and tremendous.
Hollah!
Bet you've never seen that one!
Knocked 'em dead in New York!
- Let's all give it a try!
- Let's do it!
Well, you can try all you want to, but it takes years of practice.
You'll never get a tight stream until you build up your lip muscles to the point where you can purse your lips like this.
You got it?
Ta-da!
How did you?
You guys got it right out of the box!
- If you can do it...
...we can do it.
It's in our blood!
I always thought I was a bit unique.
We are unique!
We are like a force of nature!
- A million points of light!
- And dark stripes!
Exactly the same!
Exactly the same.
Looks impressive, Kowalski, but will it fly?
Yes.
If we fold it here, here and here.
Nice.
Oh, man.
My dad thinks I'm a total loser.
I've ruined my parents' lives.
That is definitely not crack-a-lackin'.
It is lacking' in the cracking', my friend.
I've gotta fix this.
So there's...
There's something I gotta tell you.
Hey, guys.
Is this place great or what?
!
I'd go with "or what."
Well, I'll tell you what.
You're not gonna believe it, but I got a date with Moto Moto.
Who's Moto Moto?
Oh, he's so big and handsome and big!
- Know what "Moto Moto" means?
- Twins?
It means, "Hot Hot."
"Hot Hot"?
When did you start parlez-ing African?
It's in my blood.
Don't worry, you can flirt around with Mr. Hot Pants after I'm gone.
Melman, why am I the parade and you're the rain?
Why are you driving your parade under my rain?
Maybe I'll parade in another part of town!
Whoa, guys.
Main Street's mine!
Well, you can have it!
And you can take your hotee-tot float and Mr. Hotee Moto Moto...
- What are you talking about?
- What are we talking about?
Melman, just tell her.
What?
What are you...
I don't know what you're talking about.
I guess I'll go, then.
Don't bother.
- Don't get up on my account.
- Melman!
Gloria!
- I thought you guys were friends!
- Marty's absolutely right.
- Marty?
- Marty?
Marty?
What the heck is going on?
You're not?
Oh!
He was...
I thought he...
You're not him.
He's...
Oh.
You thought that guy was me?
No.
I mean, yes, you...
Guys, come on.
You thought I was him?
You guys kind of do look a little...
You look a lot alike.
Marty, you look a lot alike.
You laugh alike.
Talk alike.
He has the same speech pattern.
It's a little weird, really.
I mean, come on.
Marty.
So you're saying there's nothing unique about me.
I'm just like any other zebra.
No.
Of course you're different!
How?
OK, I can't tell you apart.
Maybe you could wear a bell or something.
- A bell?
!
- OK, not a bell.
Bell's a bad idea.
How about a T-shirt that says, "I'm with stupid"?
- I'm not stupid!
- Not you, stupid!
Him, stupid!
You know, while you've been doing the prancing pony with your new posse,
I've been having the worst day of my life.
It's always about you, isn't it?
My problems are just a little bit bigger than yours.
I couldn't tell you apart.
So what?
!
Yeah, fine.
Run away, Marty!
Run away!
That's what you do best!
Just like back in New York!
I'm right here.
But you can't tell that, right?
Your one-of-a-million friend hopes you enjoy your bigger-than-anyone-else's problems alone!
Good, leave!
I don't need you to help me solve my problems!
You're a dime a dozen!
I can't tell which one's Marty!
Which one's Marty?
Wait a minute.
Oh, yeah, I don't care!
Nice hat, you showoff!
Marty don't go.
Giddy-up, giddy-up!
Giddy-up, giddy-up!
Look, Maurice!
The perfect spot for my summer palace!
Please fill in all these holes and relocate the riff-raff.
- Who'd leave a perfectly good head?
- What a waste.
Tell me about it.
I'm in my prime here.
I'm terminal, you know?
I probably only have another two days left to live.
That's a bummer, man.
If I, King Julien... that's my name only had two days left to live,
I would do all the things
- I've ever dreamed of doing.
- Like what?
I'd love to become a professional whistler.
I'm pretty amazing at it now, but I want to get even better, make my living out of it.
You know what else I would do?
I would invade a neighboring country and impose my own ideology, even if they didn't want it!
Easy for you to say.
You're a king.
Yes.
And you are only just a sad little head.
There must be something you want to do before you die!
- There is this one thing.
- What?
Tell me.
- No, I couldn't.
- What is it?
I never told Gloria how I feel about her.
What is it?
Please tell me!
I never had the guts to tell Gloria how I feel about her.
How I've always felt about her.
Fine.
Don't tell me!
Is it a woman?
You didn't tell me it's a woman.
What are you afraid of?
You're a dead man anyway.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're right.
You've got to march right up to this woman.
Look her right in the eye.
Lean forward.
Just a little, or almost all the way.
Then you let her lean forward a little until you're just lips' distance away from each other.
Then you tell her how much you hate her.
Actually, it's more like love her.
Oh, you sly dog!
Woof, woof!
You're a real player.
Now listen to me.
You got to rise up.
You hearing me?
- He didn't hear you.
- I can't hear you!
- You got to rise up!
- Rising up!
- Get out of the hole!
- I'm rising out of the ground!
- He's rising, Maurice.
- I'm rising, Maurice!
- Rising!
- You go right up to this woman!
Do you feel it?
- Go up to her face!
- Tell the truth!
- I'm going to tell her!
- Then you say, "Baby, I dig you!"
Yeah!
I'm going to do it!
I'm going to do it!
I love that happy little head.
She love
Moto Moto
She love
Moto Moto
She loves me She loves my eyes
She loves me She loves my thighs
She loves my roundness
She love that I'm chunky She love that I'm plumpy
She love my heftiness She love my zestiness
She love me restlessly She love me forever
She love me 'cause she love me
Moto Moto before things get too serious, well,
I was wondering, if I were to, for example, stay here I'd like to ask you...
Let your candied lips be the messengers to my... ear canal.
I have so many questions.
I promise the answer will always be yes.
Unless no is required.
So what is it about me that you find so interesting?
You're the most plumpenest girl I've ever met.
OK.
Other than that.
Let's see.
Yeah, well, you know... you chunky.
Right.
My gosh, girl, you huge.
You said that.
Yeah, that's right.
We don't have to talk no more.
Gloria!
Gloria.
Melman.
Melman, I want you to meet Moto Moto.
Moto Moto.
Yeah, nice to meet you.
- I guess I...
- It's OK, Melman.
Apology accepted.
Oh.
Yeah, right, that.
That's why I...
Good.
OK.
Well, that's it, then.
Good.
We're kind of busy here, man.
No.
No, that's not it.
Listen, Mototo, you better treat this lady like a queen.
Because you, my friend, you found yourself the perfect woman.
If I was ever so lucky to find the perfect woman,
I'd give her flowers every day.
And not just any flowers.
OK?
Her favorites are orchids.
White.
And breakfast in bed.
Six loaves of wheat toast, butter on both sides.
No crust, the way she likes it.
I'd be her shoulder to cry on and her best friend.
I'd spend every day thinking of how to make her laugh.
She has the most amazing laugh.
That's what I would do if I were you.
But I'm not, so you do it.
OK.
What?
That was beautiful.
Anyways, where were we?
I'm "huge"?
Surprised to see me, Makunga?
Well, I'm here to set things straight, like a real lion!
Is this real enough for you?
How about this?
This is for setting me up!
This is for stealing my dad's job!
This is for humiliating my family!
And making me look like a fool!
Had enough?
Sure, fly away!
Coward.
The water.
It's gone.
It's never gone dry before.
- We'll need a lot more dying holes.
- How could this happen?
Out of my way!
What is going on here?
!
The watering hole is dry!
There's barely water for one of us!
- Good observation, Shirley.
- I'm Bobby.
Makunga, what do we do?
Quiet!
Listen up!
I'm afraid there is only one solution to this horrible crisis:
We'll all have to fight for it.
- We can't fight for it.
- That's crazy.
That's not fair.
You'd win!
Exactly, Shirley.
I'm Bob...
Sorry, folks, but life isn't fair.
I'm in charge now, thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion.
Please, Makunga, this is the only water on the reserve.
If you're thirsty, you'll have to look for water off the reserve.
- Off the reserve?
- It's too dangerous!
Hunters would shoot us!
No one leaves the reserve and survives!
I left the reserve!
And survived.
I can do something about this.
Looks like a clogged pipe, like we get in New York.
I'll travel upriver...
- Upriver?
- Off the reserve?
You?
Yeah.
I'll unclog the pipe and bring back your water.
Great!
I'd help you pack, but by the looks of that hat, I see you're all set!
Fine.
Go ahead, laugh.
Laugh your mane off.
I'll prove you wrong.
Maybe you should try a little rain dance.
Zuba would know what to do.
- Where's Zuba?
- You don't care about us.
Zuba should be in charge, not you.
All right, fine!
As an added measure, I will consult with Zuba!
Marty?
Hey!
Marty!
Marty?
Marty.
Where'd you get the fruity hat?
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
Hi.
Is Marty in there?
Anyone seen Marty?
Which one of us is Marty?
All right.
Well, if you see him, tell him his friend Alex came to say goodbye.
Goodbye?
Don't go.
Where are you going?
- Can we come?
- No.
I have to do this alone.
You can't leave the reserve!
What are you doing?
- They'll get your hat.
- Hunters are everywhere!
Could you leave the hat?
Marty!
I know you're in there.
Before I go, I got something I want to say.
You've been a great friend.
You've helped me so often to see the bright side of my problems that I never think of you having any.
I wasn't there for you when you needed me.
Just like back at the zoo.
What kind of friend does that make me?
A pretty lousy friend, I guess.
I just want you to know that I...
You're one in a million.
This is touching.
It is touching.
So could you turn around so I can tell you to your face?
That's right.
Gotcha!
I see you in there!
Yeah, you.
You, right there.
Twelfth row, two hundred and third from the left.
That's you, Marty.
I know it's you.
Know what makes you special?
These guys are white with black stripes.
You're black with white stripes.
You're a dreamer, Marty.
Always have been.
You have great taste in music and horrible taste in friends.
Well, not Melman and Gloria, but me.
OK, I'm in.
Marty, you can't come with me.
You don't have a choice.
- People are out there!
- You're crazy!
Come back!
The people will get you!
Don't lose the hat!
Bye, hat!
Any water?
No, just more diamonds and gold.
Don't give up hope.
Listen up!
I will help you!
There's only one way to get your precious water.
I, your beloved King Julien must simply make a small sacrifice to my good friends, the water gods, in the volcano!
What does that do?
What does that do?
Excellent question.
My sacrifice goes in the volcano.
The friendly gods eat up my sacrifice.
"Thank you for the sacrifice."
"Here, have another." "No, I've had enough."
"I'll be insulted unless you have another."
"I don't want another sacrifice!"
"Look at you!
You're skinny!" "No!
I've had enough!"
The gods eat the sacrifice.
They are grateful.
They give me some water, and then I give it to you.
What?
Does it work?
No!
I mean, yes.
Well, Maurice?
Ah, it's fifty-fifty.
We'll do it!
Excellent!
Now all I need is someone who would like to go into the volcano and get eaten by gods.
Any hands!
Hands, anybody!
I need someone, perhaps who has never found love, who could look death straight in the eyeball.
A real, genuine hero.
- I'll do it.
- Melman?
Hurry up!
Before we all come to our senses!
Melman, what is wrong with you?
I'm dying anyway.
If there's a chance it'll get you water, it's worth it.
Are you nuts?
I want you to know, back at the zoo, it was never the doctors or prescriptions that kept me going.
It was always you.
Seeing you every day.
That's what kept me going.
Melman!
Wait!
Melman!
Melman!
Melman!
You going to mope like this all day?
Don't "hmph" me.
Listen, Zuba.
A miracle happened.
Our son came back to us.
How come that is not good enough for you?
What are you saying, woman?
We lost him once, Zuba.
Let's not lose him again.
Zuba!
- Zuba!
- Get out of here!
What do you want?
It's awful.
The watering hole is dried up.
Dried up?
That's impossible!
There's nothing left!
You're alpha lion, Makunga.
What are you gonna do about it?
Your son, Alakay, he said he could fix it.
He's gone upriver.
- Off the reserve?
!
- No!
I tried to stop him.
I told him it was suicide.
He was determined to prove himself to you.
You stay here, in case he comes back!
Hurry, Zuba!
I'm so parched.
Is this place starting to freak you out?
We'll slip in, find the problem.
Hunters will never know we were here.
Why are we doing this?
Maybe my dad will think I'm...
I want to show him I'm a real lion.
As opposed to a chocolate lion.
I know this may sound hard to believe, but apparently, lions don't dance.
What?
!
As far as my dad is concerned.
As far as people are concerned, you're a hit.
In New York.
This is Africa...
much tougher crowd.
Marty, this is it!
This is the clog!
Come on.
Well, there's the water.
Stay down.
Look at that.
Knit one, purl two.
It's her.
- Is this right?
- Very good.
Nana, slow down.
You're a little tangled, aren't you?
No, don't pull.
I'll do it.
We need dynamite.
Got any?
Oh, snap!
I just used my last stick this morning!
- Savages!
- Evasive maneuvers!
- Serpentine, serpentine!
- Squiggly squid maneuver!
Zag, zig-zag, zig ziggy zag!
No, no!
Squiggly squid!
Etch A Sketch!
That's too complex!
Octopus, octopus!
- Run, Marty!
- I can't leave you here!
Go get help!
Squiggly squid maneuver!
Go!
Go!
Squiggly squid!
Etch A Sketch!
Etch A Sketch!
Save us We love you
OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- Save us
- Melman
- We love you
- Melman
Save us
OK, here we go.
OK, OK.
- Melman
- We love you
- Melman
- Save us
Here we go!
Here we go!
- What's all the hoopla about?
- Joe?
Joe the Witch Doctor?
We thought you were dead!
So did I. Then I realized I'm covered in brown spots.
So Melman's not dying!
- Melman's not dying!
- Oh, no!
Melman!
Move!
Don't do this!
Julien, stop this!
This is crazy!
Oh, suddenly throwing a giraffe into a volcano to make water is crazy!
Yes!
- Please, Melman!
Stop!
- Gloria?
- You can't do this!
- Why not?
Because...
You can't do this, Melman.
First, that hurts.
Second, I've only got 18 hours to live, anyway.
Melman, I gotta know did you mean those things you said about me?
Of course I did.
- That's crazy.
- It is?
It's crazy to think I had to go halfway around the world to find out the perfect guy for me lived right next door.
Then it's you and me, neighbor.
You and me for the next 18 hours.
I'll take whatever you got.
- Maurice, what happened?
- I believe the fat lady has sung.
- What's going on here?
- Marty!
Alex is in big trouble!
We got to get upriver fast!
- What about the plane?
- Perfect!
Come on!
The plane won't be fixed until the suits meet our demands.
Now, maternity leave.
Maternity leave?
You're all males.
We need that plane for a rescue mission.
There's nothing I can do until we bust up this union.
I'll bust up all of you if you don't get this plane going.
Can't you see these commies have my hands tied?
No maternity leave.
Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want these blowing around on the savanna.
All right.
You get your maternity leave.
Finally.
Where we headed?
What's going on?
Where are we going?
Oh, no!
Please!
Don't put me there!
No!
This is wrong.
You see?
You are survivors.
Now, how about a nice lion casserole?
You can't eat a lion.
Don't worry, it tastes like chicken.
No, no, no.
Don't listen to her.
She's out of her mind, people!
I'm from New York City!
It's me, Alex the lion!
From Central Park!
Dad!
What were you thinking, son?
You got no business being out here!
Stay behind me.
They're New Yorkers.
They're just rude and frightened people.
Stay back!
You'd let your dinner get away?
- What are you doing?
- The only thing I know how to do.
What the heck?
Hey, I know those moves.
Alex?
- It's Alex the lion!
- From Central Park!
It is Alex!
Only one lion can move like that!
He's beautiful.
I can't believe it.
How does he do that?
What are you doing?
I'm dancing with my son!
I think.
Don't think, Dad.
Feel!
Butterfly!
I'm feeling it!
I'm feeling it!
Roar!
That was beautiful.
Now let's eat!
Dad, look out!
What the...
Alex!
Get in!
She's got a gun!
Get out while we can!
- What?
- She's got a gun!
Get out while we can!
Pass it on!
He said let's have some fun and take out the dam.
Basset hound.
Skipper!
Alex wants to take out the dam.
All right!
But it's his funeral.
- Hard to port!
- Aye-aye, Skippy!
Bring it on!
Bring it on!
Come back!
That's my dinner!
Kowalski, full throttle.
Music!
- I like this song.
- It never gets old.
It does have a catchy hook.
Come about!
Bring her in low!
Hold onto your skirts!
It's dam-busting time!
Hold on tight, baby!
Here we go!
Tell them no!
Pull up!
They'll kill us!
There's got to be another way!
Pass it on!
They say no pull up.
Kill us.
There's no other way.
Basset hound.
Are you sure?
Men, there is no sacrifice greater than someone else's.
No!
Medic!
Ramming speed!
Bring it on!
Bad kitties.
I don't know why the sacrifice didn't work.
The science seemed so solid.
I'd jump right in that volcano if I wasn't so good at whistling.
It's you!
I found you!
Mort?
Bad fishy!
I wonder if the gods like seafood.
Let's find out.
Look, Maurice.
- That was quick.
- I did it!
I did it!
I did it!
OK, you did it!
Oh, yes!
Look!
- It's Alakay!
- It's Zuba!
You did it!
Alakay, Zuba, you did it!
Zuba!
Alakay!
You're back!
I'm so glad you're safe!
Out of my way.
Well, well, well.
You know, Zuba, if I remember correctly, you quit the pride.
And you were kicked out.
So don't think that this changes anything.
You're right.
In fact, we humbly present you with this token of appreciation.
A man bag.
Very popular where I'm from.
- Don't know what to say.
- Still be tough and carry your stuff.
Does the strap adjust?
This will go very nicely for me when I go out hiking.
But you're still banished.
We figured you'd say that.
My handbag!
You bad kitty!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
You deserve this, son.
Welcome to the pride.
Thanks, Dad.
But this belongs to you.
No, son.
To us!
My son!
The King of New York!
That's my baby!
Love transcends all differences.
We are gathered here today to celebrate such a love.
Do you take each other, for better or for worse?
For better, please.
What a beautiful, weird couple!
That's not going to last.
Can I kiss the bride?
No!
Music!
- Struts.
- Check.
- Flaps!
- Check.
- Diamonds and gold.
- Check.
- Bye-bye!
- We'll miss you!
See you later!
We'll be back after the honeymoon in Monte Carlo, or whenever the gold runs out.
Come back soon!
Mom, let them take their time.
New York isn't going anywhere, right, guys?
You're right about that!
As long as I'm with her and you two, I don't care where we are.
She has the most amazing laugh.
Love has no boundaries!
Looks like you're stuck with us for a while.
Dad?
What's wrong?
I just thought we could hang out a bit and...
- You got me!
- I got you, son!
You got me with my thing.
You brought it back around on me.
I got you, son!
The old man's not too bad, eh, Marty?
- Marty?
Who's Marty?
- Come on.
- I don't know no Marty.
- You can't fool me.
Ain't no Marty here.
Marty!
I can look into your eyes, and I know it's you.
See, I've been traveling Been traveling forever
But now that I found a home feels like I'm in heaven
See, I've been traveling Been traveling forever
But now that I'm home
Hey!
Shake the hot things!
Shake the hot things!
Shake 'em!
Shake 'em!
Shake 'em!

Well done, boys.
Looks like ice-cold sushi for breakfast.
No, no, son.
Over here.
See the lion?
Look at the lion and get the lion.
Now, son, if you're gonna grow up and be like your daddy someday, you gotta learn how to fight.
Da-da.
Now, Alakay, let me show you something, OK?
You see this mark?
You and me are the same.
When you're bigger, you'll be Alpha Lion, just like me.
Now let me see you fight.
Ready?
No, Alakay.
No dancing!
You just amuse yourself, don't you?
You're a strange kid.
You're a strange one.
I'm...
Now, come on, let's try it again.
No, Alakay.
Stop that right now.
Doggone it!
It's so disappointing when they don't grow up the way you want.
Makunga.
You're not challenging me again, are you?
Look on the bright side.
After I defeat you and become alpha lion, you'll have more time to spend with your pathetic son.
Before I kick your butt, let me ask you:
Why do you want to become the alpha lion?
I'm better looking, I have better hair, I'm deceivingly smart and I want everyone else to do what I say.
We fight on three.
One...
Pay attention, Alakay.
Daddy will show you how it's done.
Two, three!
- Who's the alpha lion?
- You are.
Don't you forget it.
And that, Alakay, is how you attack...
Alakay?
That's it.
Here, kitty, kitty.
This one's a beauty.
He'll be worth a few bucks.
Itjust gets easier and easier.
Daddy!
Alakay!
Alakay!
Alakay!
Da-da!
No!
No!
No!
Alakay!
- Daddy!
- Daddy's got you!
Hold on!
Da-da!
Alakay!
Daddy!
I've been around the world in the pouring rain
Feeling out of place and feeling strange
Take me to a place where they know my name
'Oause I ain't met nobody that looks the same

Feeling right at home I'm feeling right at home
See I been traveling Been traveling forever...
- I don't like the looks of this guy.
- He's kind of cute.
He's kind of a showoff.
You think he's cute?
Roar!
The King of New York Oity Alex the Lion!
I still think he's kind of a showoff.
The guy's an animal.
Maybe he should take a break.
You know, we could all use a vacation.
Oome on, where would we go on vacation?
I don't know about you, but I want to go to Oonnecticut!
On the loose, several animals, including the world famous Alex the Lion, escaped from the Oentral Park Zoo tonight.
The escapees were cornered in Grand Oentral Station.
He was a very bad kitty.
Animal rights activists, who convinced zoo officials to have the animals sent to Africa, were stunned to learn that the freighter carrying the animals was reported missing today.
Tonight, hundreds of New Yorkers have gathered at the zoo to mourn the loss of their beloved zoo animals.
The question on everyone's mind, where are they now?
I like to move it, move it
He likes to move it, move it
She likes to move it, move it
- We like to
- Move it!
Oome on!
Y'all know this one!
It never gets stale!
- We like to
- Move it!
We'll miss you little fuzz buckets!
You've been a great crowd!
Glad we could introduce you to the toilet.
If you ever come look us up in Manhattan, feel free to call first.
Seriously though, call.
OK?
Settle down, everybody.
Be quiet!
You can't leave without this!
Surprise, freaks!
Shake it!
Shake it.
Look, I'm a lady!
I'm a lady, everyone!
I'm a lady!
Not really!
It's me, King Julien!
Which of you is attracted to me?
Hands up!
Hey, freaks!
You will be very glad to hear that I am coming with you.
Oh, no, thank you.
Yes, thank you.
It's my plane!
Until I return with the spoils from the new country Stevie will be in charge!
I don't think they like that idea.
What are you saying, Stevie?
No.
Oould we...?
No, you didn't say that!
How is that even possible?
Naughty little thing!
Stevie says...
Let them eat cake!
King Julien, wait for me!
I'm all packed!
I have a whole itinerary planned!
Oh, no!
It's Mort!
He's so annoying!
Don't let him on.
Stop that thing!
He's carrying scissors and hand cream!
Everybody in!
Quickly, get in, get in!
Get in quick!
- Struts.
- Oheck.
- Flaps.
- Oheck.
- Engine.
Ooffee maker.
- Oheck.
You guys!
Oopsie-daisy!
That has to be the second biggest slingshot I've ever seen.
But it'll have to do.
Attention.
This is your captain speaking.
In the event of an emergency, place the vest over your head then kiss your... good-bye.
New York Oity, here we come!
Pray to your personal God this hunk ofjunk flies.
Personal God, hunk...?
What?
We are go, sir.
Open the door!
I'm outside!
If cabin pressure is lost, place the mask over your face to hide your terrified expression.
Miss, aren't these supposed to be attached to my seat?
- No, sir.
- OK, boys, launch!
Launch!
- Launch!
- Launch!
Gremlin!
Hey, Mort.
Hi!
That was weird.
- Somebody's dreaming.
- I think I saw Mort on the plane wing.
You got Madagascar on the brain.
I know I'm gonna miss it.
It was incredible.
I think it'll seem more fun the further we are from it.
Like when you bit me on the butt?
I'm gonna take that thing you're holding onto and use it onstage.
It's all part of my little actor's salad bar of emotional tidbits.
Are the butts next to the croutons?
You don't need to be sarcastic.
When we get back, I might sign up for the breeding program.
Breeding program?
We reach a point when we want to meet somebody.
Settle down, have a relationship.
I can see that.
What?
Like dating?
Yeah, dating.
Other... other guys?
What do you mean, other guys?
Darn it!
What is holding up that beverage service?
!
I'm gonna go check.
You all keep talking.
I'm gonna catch a few winks.
It's so funny!
I like laughing!
It's such a nice experience!
To laugh!
Do you mind going back?
This is first class.
It's nothing personal.
We're just better than you.
Maurice, I'm open!
Hit me!
- He shoots, he scores!
- Is that Vivaldi?
- In-flight slave.
- Oan I help you, Mr. Mankiewicz?
Bring my nuts on a silver platter.
We were checking on our drink order.
Sorry.
Been a little backed up.
- I guess I'll go back...
- Where's your body?
You're freaking me out!
Oan you please go over there, please?
What happened to the separation of the classes?
I'm sure this democracy thing is just a fad.
We'll go out for pineapple, my bobbly-headed boobily-boo.
Skipper, look.
Analysis.
Looks like a small bulb used to indicate something unusual, like a malfunction.
I find it pretty and somewhat hypnotic.
That too, sir.
Right!
Rico?
Manual!
Problemo solved.
- We may be out of fuel.
- Why do you think so?
We've lost engine one and engine two is no longer on fire.
Buckle up, boys.
Don't look, doll.
This might get hairy.
Attention!
This is your captain.
I have good and bad news.
The good news is, we're landing immediately.
The bad news is, we're crash-landing.
When it comes to air travel, we know you have no choice.
But thanks for choosing Air Penguin.
Raise your arms, Maurice!
It's more fun when you raise your arms!
I can fly!
This could be it, Marty!
I want you to know you are a one-in-a-million friend!
Thanks, buddy!
You're the best ever!
- And you won't mind when I tell you...
- Tell me anything!
I broke your iPod!
The buttons were so small!
It made me mad!
- The horror!
- I'm sorry!
- I'll kill you, butt-biter!
- It was an accident!
- An accident!
- Butt-biter!
I love you, Gloria!
I always have!
Like you love the beach.
Or a good book.
Or the beach.
Goodness, doll, you're shaking like a leaf.
Rico, you've had your fun.
Pull up.
Gear down.
Gently.
You just want to kiss the ground.
Just a peck, a smooch, like you'd kiss your sister.
I said, kiss it!
Now just a little brake.
Just a touch.
I believe that's checkmate.
Oommence emergency landing procedure.
Flaps up!
Deploy!
Oh, we're here.
What in the world?
What happened to the plane?
What did y'all do to the plane?
I'm OK.
I'm alive.
I can't even sleep for a minute.
This is not JFK.
Kowalski, casualty report.
Two passengers unaccounted for.
That's a number I can live with.
Good landing, boys.
Who says a penguin can't fly?
Hey, happy slappers!
Is there some reason to celebrate?
Look at the plane!
- We'll fix it.
- How are you gonna fix this?
Grit, spit and a whole lot of duct tape.
We should be up and running in, say, six to nine months.
- Sixty-nine months?
!
- No, six to nine months.
Kowalski, I say we use this setback to our advantage.
- Where'd you get that number?
- I want you to reconfigure the design.
How do you estimate that?
Pretty boy!
Why don't you and your friends dig a latrine.
Hold on.
Who made you king of the plane wreck?
Excuse me?
Fine.
You can be in charge.
You fix the plane.
Who gives you the authority to put me in charge?
OK, then I'll remain in charge.
Yeah, you will remain in charge.
You and your hippie friends stay out of our hair.
Oorrecto-mundo.
Because I decided to.
- Good for you.
- Well, this discussion isn't over.
Higher mammals!
Stay with us.
We could use your front cortexes and opposable thumbs.
Phil!
I should wash your hands out with soap.
How in the hell-o will they fix this plane?
!
You know, grit and spit and spit.
A lot of spit and grit and stick-to-it-iveness.
That don't sound too promising.
You're right.
We're stuck here.
As long as we're together, we'll be OK.
Yeah, but love ain't gonna get us home.
Behold!
The lion!
- People!
- There is much to see.
Moving on.
Wait, wait, wait!
People!
- They'll help us!
- Wait up!
- People!
Stop!
- Help us!
If you stop, I'll autograph those!
I know you!
You.
It's the bad kitty.
How do you like some of that?
!
Oome in, Tokyo!
Right in the batteries.
You think an old lady can't take care of herself?
Next time, I won't go so easy on you!
Thank you, dear.
Moving on!
Are you out of your mind?
We need help and you harass old ladies?
!
Out of my mind?
Who's out of my mind now?
- See if you can get an operator.
- No problem.
Out of my mind.
We're going home.
Message E-4.
The service user has roamed outside the coverage area.
Please try again later.
Am I trippin'?
All those zebras...
like me.
- Where are we?
- San Diego.
This time I'm 40 percent sure.
- I know this place.
- I think it's Africa.
Africa?
It's got to be.
Our ancestral crib.
It's in our blood.
I can feel it!
No, it's more than that.
It's like déjà vu, like I've been here before.
It's like Roots!
No, it's like déjà vu, like I've been here before.
How!
How!
Me Alex!
Me and me friends fly, fly in great metal bird.
Then plummet!
Smash ground!
Go boom!
Then here we emerge.
We offer only happiness and good greetings.
Is he dancing about a plane crash?
Yeah.
We just... yeah.
I thought...
Sorry.
You came from off the reserve?
Way off.
From the Oentral Park Zoo, actually.
Don't strain yourself.
What's going on here?
They say they're from off the reserve.
That's impossible.
Only people come from off the reserve.
You look familiar.
Do I know you?
How could you survive the hunters?
We didn't see any hunters.
- What are you looking at?
- Me?
Nothing.
This watering hole doesn't need any more mouths to feed.
So skedaddle back to where you came from.
Is there a manager we could talk to?
I see.
You're here to challenge me!
What?
No!
No.
That's what it looks like to me!
Zuba!
Wait.
I'm trying to take care of business...
Yeah, yeah, Zuba.
Hold on.
Alakay?
Is that you?
No, it's Alex.
Ix.
Like New York Knicks.
Zuba, look!
I've always had that.
The vet checked it out.
It's kind of a beauty spot, really.
A mark.
All right, this is a little weird.
Honey, he's come home.
What?
You've come home.
Son.
Dad.
Mom and Dad?
Mom and Dad!
Mom and Dad!
It's my mom and dad!
I got a mom and dad!
My baby's alive!
Dad!
My son!
My son is home!
Alakay!
Alakay has come home!
Alakay!
Yeah!
The prodigal son returns.
This is perfect!
I thought you hated Zuba.
No, I do.
I do.
I do.
I hate him.
Oh, I do.
And I'm going to use Alakay, yes.
I'm going to use him to get rid of Zuba once and for all!
Giddy-up, feathered horse!
Make way!
Move out of the way!
Stand aside!
New York!
It's a bit of a dump.
Are you sure we're not in New Jersey?
Hello, New Yorkers!
Your new king is here!
This calls for a celebration!
Maurice, I think they like me.
You've got to love a non-hostile takeover!
Ohukka-chukka what?
Excuse me.
I'm Marty.
I'm kind of new around here.
Hey, Marty!
You're a good-looking group!
You like to run?
Yeah.
Running is crack-a-lackin'.
That's right!
Orack-a-lackin'.
You guys speak my crack-a-lackin' language.
What?
You don't have doctors here?
Not anymore.
Well, what if you catch a cold?
We go over to the dying holes and we die.
You guys really need a doctor.
- We have an opening.
- Would you be interested?
Me?
A doctor?
It's raining men.
Hallelujah!
You all got it going on.
Why don't you have a man?
You got worms?
Oh, I got rid of those.
Listen, girls.
Manhattan is short on two things, parking and hippos.
Hey, everybody!
I just found out that my son is a doggone king!
The King of New York!
Show me some of your moves, son.
Don't be bashful.
All right.
This one always knocks 'em dead.
Roar!
Look out.
The King is mad.
The King is mad!
Let's welcome him back into the pride with open arms!
Welcome to the herd, Marty!
Me?
I've always wanted to be part of a herd!
- It's one for all...
- And all for all, y'all!
How do I look?
Technically, a traditional witch doctor has a bone through his nose.
Don't worry... it's just a clip-on.
Voilà!
He's a witch doctor!
My mother will be so happy.
Look out!
I think Moto Moto likes you.
Here he comes.
I like 'em big
I like 'em chunky
I like 'em big I like 'em plumpy
I like 'em round With something' somethin'
They like my sound They think I'm funky
Goodness, girl... you huge.
Who's your friend?
Or is that your butt?
You as quick as you are hefty.
So you're Moto Moto?
The name's so nice, you say it twice.
I kind of like it, fatso.
I'll see you around, girl.
It won't be hard, because you so... plumpy.
Oops!
I hate to be a party pooper, Zuba, but some of the lions were wondering when you plan to banish your son.
- What are you talking about?
- It's nothing, really.
They're griping that Alakay never went through the rite of passage, blah, blah, blah, so technically speaking, he can't be a member of the pride.
It's nonsense.
I forgot about the rite of passage.
What is it?
What's this rite of passage?
A traditional coming-of-age ceremony.
Young lions earn their manes by demonstrating their skills.
- A show-of-skill talent show deal?
- Yeah.
Strutting their stuff.
A performance!
I think that's up my alley.
If it's tradition, I want to do it.
Strut my stuff.
Earn my mane.
I want to be Alaki.
- Alakay.
- Alakay!
Even better.
We will hold the rite of passage in the morning!
That's wonderful!
Good luck, Alakay.
Where I'm from, we say, "Break a leg. "
That's my boy!
I'm a private dancer
A dancer for money
Any old music will do
Beautiful, isn't it?
It's amazing.
Guys this is where we belong.
Operation Tourist Trap is a go.
Oh, I like that one.
It works on many levels.
You guys are a bunch of suck-ups.
- That, too.
- Absolutely.
Stations.
Stage one.
Go!
Oh, no!
What have I done?
Oome on, take the bait.
- What happened?
- Oh, look at the poor little guy.
Is it dead?
Stage two!
Go, go, go!
I will give him the kiss of life.
Rico!
Rico!
Reverse!
Gas!
Music!
No!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Oome back!
What is all this rock'n'roll racket?
!
Is she dead?
No!
You hoodlums!
Good heavens!
Are you OK?
Lady, I found your pocketbook.
My handbag.
Such a good boy.
Nana can't survive without it.
You are one tough cookie.
Brownies Troop 416, Yonkers.
OK, nobody panic!
The best thing we can do is stay together.
We'll wait for another tourjeep.
It may take hours, but...
Where are you going?
I'm not staying here to be attacked by more animals!
I'm too old to die.
I'm going with her.
Old lady, wait up!
Please!
We need to stay together.
Fine!
We'll go that way!
Does anyone want a hard candy?
- Easy now.
- Watch your step.
And right here...
OK, are you ready?
This is where you always slept.
Oh, man!
- Was this mine?
- Look at you.
Look at him.
Oh, this thing.
Look, look!
- I remember this!
- He remembers.
A little harder than...
You never slept on the right end.
You always slept on the bottom end.
Is that...?
Is that my...?
Is that me?
You had the cutest little paws.
Little, little bitty ol' paws.
You did that the day we lost you.
Wow.
I was so young.
What happened to me?
It was all my fault.
I turned my back and...
It was not your fault.
Your father did everything he could.
He tracked those hunters for weeks.
Far off the reserve.
Finally, I had to assume the hunters well...
We thought they'd killed you.
But my son fought them off!
Don't mess with the King of New York!
- That's right!
- Keep your chin in.
You boys be careful!
Watch out before you break something.
You used to call this "foofie. "
"Foofie"?
Foofie.
He doesn't want that.
This is my foofie!
Zuba, you better give him his foofie.
I mean, no, thank you, thank you.
It's perfect.
Son, you get your rest.
You have a big day tomorrow.
You'll need all your strength.
I will bring the house down for you.
I hope so.
Otherwise, your father will have to banish you.
Jeez, Mom, really?
I know you'll do us proud.
You know why?
You were born with it.
Good night, Alakay.
My boy.
My own boy.
My son's a king.
My son's a king.
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Alakay.
Foofie.
Look at foofie!
My foofie!
Foofie, foofie, foofie.
My foofie!
No sign of civilization.
Everybody appears very tired.
I think we're lost.
Nana, do you know where you're going?
No, but I'm going with a skip in my step and a smile on my face.
Sure, right, OK.
Yeah, all right.
- It's people.
- How did you get here?
- Oan you help us?
We're lost.
- We're lost too.
It was awful.
A flash of black and white and they were gone.
They took the jeep!
- That happened to ourjeep too!
- What do we do?
How will we all survive?
No food, no water, no shelter.
What are we gonna do?
!
You can let nature get the best of you, or you can get the best of nature.
Gather 'round, children.
We're New Yorkers, right?
Yeah.
We survive the concrete jungle!
When we need food, we hunt for a decent hot dog stand.
- Am I right?
- She's right.
When we need shelter, we build skyscrapers.
- Exactly!
- When we need water, we build a dam.
We're New Yorkers, for crying out loud!
If we can make it there, we can make it anywhere!
I'm coming, King Julien!
Bad fishy!
Bad fishy!
No, shark, no!
Sit!
Why am I laughing?
We have all the parts we need, but we're slightly behind schedule.
- How slightly?
- Six to nine years.
- Sixty-nine years?
- No, six to nine years.
Private!
What happened to our thumbs?
Haven't seen them since yesterday.
Darn you, Darwin!
Nobody goes AWOL on my watch.
Private!
You're coming with me.
Rico!
You're coming with me!
- We'll bring them in for court martial.
- That won't be necessary!
We've recruited a few extra thumbs for you, Skipper.
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.
Oh, I doubt that.
Enough lollygagging.
Let's get to work.
There'll be three groups.
Group Alpha will do sheet metal fabrication.
Group Bronson handles assembly.
Group George Peppard, craft services.
Any questions?
Good!
Let's get to work.
I'd like to kiss you, monkey man.
All right, but you're so darn ugly.
Remember, little cub scouts, a great dance performance comes from the heart.
Straight from the heart, you'll never go wrong.
Sure, mister.
Hey, Alakay, I just happened to walk by, I thought I'd wish you luck.
- You're not nervous, are you?
- Nah, it's my thing.
In my opinion, the key to this is choosing the right competitor.
You mean, this is like a dance battle sort of thing?
- Like a dance-off?
- Sure.
Great.
I love that.
Freestyle.
Who'd be a good match for me?
Just to keep things interesting.
Well, I wish I could help, but that's strictly against our ancient tradition and all we hold sacred.
But if it was me out there...
I'd choose Teetsi.
Teetsi.
OK.
Sounds interesting.
Makunga, right?
Thank you.
Anything for Zuba's boy.
Go get 'em, tiger.
Shake it out.
A five, six, seven, eight.
Let's go, let's do this.
Let us begin the rite of passage ceremony.
- Oome on, baby!
Make Mama proud!
- Woman, I'm trying to take...
On it, Mom!
Who will be the first participant?
Me!
Oh!
Me, me, me!
Me!
Me!
Me!
Me, me!
Please, me?
How about you?
The tall, handsome one.
Yeah.
Ohoose your opponent.
Let me see.
I guess I'll pick Teetsi?
Teetsi?
Why did he pick Teetsi?
That's my boy!
He's got some gumption there!
Somebody, wake him up!
All right, so, Teetsi, come on.
Let's do this, huh?
Oome on, little tsetse fly.
Let's see your stuff.
Bring it.
- Let's dance!
- OK.
But let me warn you that I am a protégé of Fosse and Robbins!
Not "dance" dance!
Fight!
Dance fight!
You got it.
- Is he dancing?
- What's he doing?
I know that boy is not dancing.
This is even better than I thought.
Alakay, turn around!
No, Pop, it's hop, shuffle, ball change, hip swish, turn around.
Oh, no.
Alakay!
Are you hurt?
Yeah, I am.
Did I... did I win?
No, son.
How could this happen?
You told us you were a king.
A king does not get beat.
I am a king.
I'm the King of New York.
It's my stage name.
Like for when I perform.
Perform?
Oh, no, this is horrible!
Alakay has failed the test!
Who would have ever imagined that today Zuba would have to banish his own son?
Zuba, no.
Zuba, yes.
Sadly, the alpha lion must cast out all failures.
Then I'm no longer the alpha lion.
Dad, what are you doing?
Dad, no!
You can't do this.
Who could possibly take Zuba's place?
Anyone?
Someone?
No one?
You, sir!
I guess not.
Well, I... this is all very awkward, but I suppose I could carry this tremendous burden.
Teetsi!
Get the hat.
As your new leader, I hereby banish Alakay!
He shall wear this Hat of Shame and leave the watering hole for a thousand years, or life!
Whichever comes last.
Shoo, shoo!
Get out of here!
You should have told us you weren't a real king, son!
You never told me I'd have to fight anybody!
What did you expect?
!
I don't know!
Maybe a little fatherly advice like, "Hey, son, it's a fight!"
- You're a lion!
- But I never fought another lion!
No, I guess not.
You dance!
And other stuff!
Your pal, Makunga, set me up back there!
- None of this would have happened...
- If you were a real lion.
- Zuba!
- Yeah, I said it!
A real lion.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Saw.
Suture.
Swab.
You're in my light, Stephen.
You have a brown spot on your shoulder.
That's very observant, Stephen.
As you can see, I'm covered in brown spots.
OK!
That bone will be good as new in a few weeks.
So I don't have to pick out a dying hole?
No, you got your whole life ahead of you.
- Really?
- Go out and grab it by the horns.
- Thank you, Dr. Mankiewicz!
- Break a leg!
Sweet kid.
This spot looks like Witch Doctor's Disease.
Witch Doctor's Disease?
That's the most ridiculous disease I've ever heard of.
- Don't ask.
- Someone's been knotty.
This won't hurt a bit.
Joe, our last witch doctor, had a spotjust like that.
- And?
- Monday, Joe.
Wednesday, no Joe.
Wednesday, no Joe?
I can breathe!
Thanks, doc!
So this Witch Doctor's Disease is a real thing?
You'll find a cure.
You've got at least 48 hours!
But I've never heard of it.
I mean...
I don't have any penicillin.
I'll need a OAT scan just to get started!
Have a lion look you over.
They'd be happy to.
Ta-da!
- He has talent.
- Stupendous and tremendous.
Hollah!
Bet you've never seen that one!
Knocked 'em dead in New York!
- Let's all give it a try!
- Let's do it!
Well, you can try all you want to, but it takes years of practice.
You'll never get a tight stream until you build up your lip muscles to the point where you can purse your lips like this.
You got it?
Ta-da!
How did you...?
You guys got it right out of the box!
- If you can do it...
... we can do it.
It's in our blood!
I always thought I was a bit unique.
We are unique!
We are like a force of nature!
- A million points of light!
- And dark stripes!
Exactly the same!
Exactly the same.
Looks impressive, Kowalski, but will it fly?
Yes.
If we fold it here, here and here.
Nice.
Oh, man.
My dad thinks I'm a total loser.
I've ruined my parents' lives.
That is definitely not crack-a-lackin'.
It is lacking' in the cracking', my friend.
I've gotta fix this.
So there's...
There's something I gotta tell you.
Hey, guys.
Is this place great or what?
!
I'd go with "or what. "
Well, I'll tell you what.
You're not gonna believe it, but I got a date with Moto Moto.
Who's Moto Moto?
Oh, he's so big and handsome and big!
- Know what "Moto Moto" means?
- Twins?
It means, "Hot Hot. "
"Hot Hot"?
When did you start parlez-ing African?
It's in my blood.
Don't worry, you can flirt around with Mr. Hot Pants after I'm gone.
Melman, why am I the parade and you're the rain?
Why are you driving your parade under my rain?
Maybe I'll parade in another part of town!
Whoa, guys.
Main Street's mine!
Well, you can have it!
And you can take your hotee-tot float and Mr. Hotee Moto Moto...
- What are you talking about?
- What are we talking about?
Melman, just tell her.
What?
What are you...
I don't know what you're talking about.
I guess I'll go, then.
Don't bother.
- Don't get up on my account.
- Melman!
Gloria!
- I thought you guys were friends!
- Marty's absolutely right.
- Marty?
- Marty?
Marty?
What the heck is going on?
You're not...?
Oh!
He was...
I thought he...
You're not him.
He's...
Oh.
You thought that guy was me?
No.
I mean, yes, you...
Guys, come on.
You thought I was him?
You guys kind of do look a little...
You look a lot alike.
Marty, you look a lot alike.
You laugh alike.
Talk alike.
He has the same speech pattern.
It's a little weird, really.
I mean, come on.
Marty.
So you're saying there's nothing unique about me.
I'm just like any other zebra.
No.
Of course you're different!
How?
OK, I can't tell you apart.
Maybe you could wear a bell or something.
- A bell?
!
- OK, not a bell.
Bell's a bad idea.
How about a T-shirt that says, "I'm with stupid"?
- I'm not stupid!
- Not you, stupid!
Him, stupid!
You know, while you've been doing the prancing pony with your new posse,
I've been having the worst day of my life.
It's always about you, isn't it?
My problems are just a little bit bigger than yours.
I couldn't tell you apart.
So what?
!
Yeah, fine.
Run away, Marty!
Run away!
That's what you do best!
Just like back in New York!
I'm right here.
But you can't tell that, right?
Your one-of-a-million friend hopes you enjoy your bigger-than-anyone-else's problems alone!
Good, leave!
I don't need you to help me solve my problems!
You're a dime a dozen!
I can't tell which one's Marty!
Which one's Marty?
Wait a minute.
Oh, yeah, I don't care!
Nice hat, you showoff!
Marty don't go.
Giddy-up, giddy-up!
Look, Maurice!
The perfect spot for my summer palace!
Please fill in all these holes and relocate the riff-raff.
- Who'd leave a perfectly good head?
- What a waste.
Tell me about it.
I'm in my prime here.
I'm terminal, you know?
I probably only have another two days left to live.
That's a bummer, man.
If I, King Julien... that's my name only had two days left to live,
I would do all the things
- I've ever dreamed of doing.
- Like what?
I'd love to become a professional whistler.
I'm pretty amazing at it now, but I want to get even better, make my living out of it.
You know what else I would do?
I would invade a neighboring country and impose my own ideology, even if they didn't want it!
Easy for you to say.
You're a king.
Yes.
And you are only just a sad little head.
There must be something you want to do before you die!
- There is this one thing.
- What?
Tell me.
- No, I couldn't.
- What is it?
I never told Gloria how I feel about her.
What is it?
Please tell me!
I never had the guts to tell Gloria how I feel about her.
How I've always felt about her.
Fine.
Don't tell me!
Is it a woman?
You didn't tell me it's a woman.
What are you afraid of?
You're a dead man anyway.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're right.
You've got to march right up to this woman.
Look her right in the eye.
Lean forward.
Just a little, or almost all the way.
Then you let her lean forward a little until you're just lips' distance away from each other.
Then you tell her how much you hate her.
Actually, it's more like love her.
Oh, you sly dog!
Woof, woof!
You're a real player.
Now listen to me.
You got to rise up.
You hearing me?
- He didn't hear you.
- I can't hear you!
- You got to rise up!
- Rising up!
- Get out of the hole!
- I'm rising out of the ground!
- He's rising, Maurice.
- I'm rising, Maurice!
- Rising!
- You go right up to this woman!
Do you feel it?
- Go up to her face!
- Tell the truth!
- I'm going to tell her!
- Then you say, "Baby, I dig you!"
Yeah!
I'm going to do it!
I'm going to do it!
I love that happy little head.
She love
Moto Moto
She love
Moto Moto
She loves me She loves my eyes
She loves me She loves my thighs
She loves my roundness
She love that I'm chunky She love that I'm plumpy
She love my heftiness She love my zestiness
She love me restlessly She love me forever
She love me 'cause she love me
Moto Moto before things get too serious, well,
I was wondering, if I were to, for example, stay here I'd like to ask you...
Let your candied lips be the messengers to my... ear canal.
I have so many questions.
I promise the answer will always be yes.
Unless no is required.
So what is it about me that you find so interesting?
You're the most plumpenest girl I've ever met.
OK.
Other than that.
Let's see.
Yeah, well, you know... you chunky.
Right.
My gosh, girl, you huge.
You said that.
Yeah, that's right.
We don't have to talk no more.
Gloria!
Gloria.
Melman.
Melman, I want you to meet Moto Moto.
Moto Moto.
Yeah, nice to meet you.
- I guess I...
- It's OK, Melman.
Apology accepted.
Oh.
Yeah, right, that.
That's why I...
Good.
OK.
Well, that's it, then.
Good.
We're kind of busy here, man.
No.
No, that's not it.
Listen, Mototo, you better treat this lady like a queen.
Because you, my friend, you found yourself the perfect woman.
If I was ever so lucky to find the perfect woman,
I'd give her flowers every day.
And notjust any flowers.
OK?
Her favorites are orchids.
White.
And breakfast in bed.
Six loaves of wheat toast, butter on both sides.
No crust, the way she likes it.
I'd be her shoulder to cry on and her best friend.
I'd spend every day thinking of how to make her laugh.
She has the most amazing laugh.
That's what I would do if I were you.
But I'm not, so you do it.
OK.
What?
That was beautiful.
Anyways, where were we?
I'm "huge"?
Surprised to see me, Makunga?
Well, I'm here to set things straight, like a real lion!
Is this real enough for you?
How about this?
This is for setting me up!
This is for stealing my dad's job!
This is for humiliating my family!
And making me look like a fool!
Had enough?
Sure, fly away!
Ooward.
The water.
It's gone.
It's never gone dry before.
- We'll need a lot more dying holes.
- How could this happen?
Out of my way!
What is going on here?
!
The watering hole is dry!
There's barely water for one of us!
- Good observation, Shirley.
- I'm Bobby.
Makunga, what do we do?
Quiet!
Listen up!
I'm afraid there is only one solution to this horrible crisis:
We'll all have to fight for it.
- We can't fight for it.
- That's crazy.
That's not fair.
You'd win!
Exactly, Shirley.
I'm Bob...
Sorry, folks, but life isn't fair.
I'm in charge now, thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion.
Please, Makunga, this is the only water on the reserve.
If you're thirsty, you'll have to look for water off the reserve.
- Off the reserve?
- It's too dangerous!
Hunters would shoot us!
No one leaves the reserve and survives!
I left the reserve!
And survived.
I can do something about this.
Looks like a clogged pipe, like we get in New York.
I'll travel upriver...
- Upriver?
- Off the reserve?
You?
Yeah.
I'll unclog the pipe and bring back your water.
Great!
I'd help you pack, but by the looks of that hat, I see you're all set!
Fine.
Go ahead, laugh.
Laugh your mane off.
I'll prove you wrong.
Maybe you should try a little rain dance.
Zuba would know what to do.
- Where's Zuba?
- You don't care about us.
Zuba should be in charge, not you.
All right, fine!
As an added measure, I will consult with Zuba!
Marty?
Hey!
Marty!
Marty?
Marty.
Where'd you get the fruity hat?
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
Hi.
Is Marty in there?
Anyone seen Marty?
Which one of us is Marty?
All right.
Well, if you see him, tell him his friend Alex came to say goodbye.
Goodbye?
Don't go.
Where are you going?
- Oan we come?
- No.
I have to do this alone.
You can't leave the reserve!
What are you doing?
- They'll get your hat.
- Hunters are everywhere!
Oould you leave the hat?
Marty!
I know you're in there.
Before I go, I got something I want to say.
You've been a great friend.
You've helped me so often to see the bright side of my problems that I never think of you having any.
I wasn't there for you when you needed me.
Just like back at the zoo.
What kind of friend does that make me?
A pretty lousy friend, I guess.
I just want you to know that I...
You're one in a million.
This is touching.
It is touching.
So could you turn around so I can tell you to your face?
That's right.
Gotcha!
I see you in there!
Yeah, you.
You, right there.
Twelfth row, two hundred and third from the left.
That's you, Marty.
I know it's you.
Know what makes you special?
These guys are white with black stripes.
You're black with white stripes.
You're a dreamer, Marty.
Always have been.
You have great taste in music and horrible taste in friends.
Well, not Melman and Gloria, but me.
OK, I'm in.
Marty, you can't come with me.
You don't have a choice.
- People are out there!
- You're crazy!
Oome back!
The people will get you!
Don't lose the hat!
Bye, hat!
Any water?
No, just more diamonds and gold.
Don't give up hope.
Listen up!
I will help you!
There's only one way to get your precious water.
I, your beloved King Julien must simply make a small sacrifice to my good friends, the water gods, in the volcano!
What does that do?
What does that do?
Excellent question.
My sacrifice goes in the volcano.
The friendly gods eat up my sacrifice.
"Thank you for the sacrifice. "
"Here, have another. " "No, I've had enough. "
"I'll be insulted unless you have another. "
"I don't want another sacrifice!"
"Look at you!
You're skinny!" "No!
I've had enough!"
The gods eat the sacrifice.
They are grateful.
They give me some water, and then I give it to you.
What?
Does it work?
No!
I mean, yes.
Well, Maurice?
Ah, it's fifty-fifty.
We'll do it!
Excellent!
Now all I need is someone who would like to go into the volcano and get eaten by gods.
Any hands!
Hands, anybody!
I need someone, perhaps who has never found love, who could look death straight in the eyeball.
A real, genuine hero.
- I'll do it.
- Melman?
Hurry up!
Before we all come to our senses!
Melman, what is wrong with you?
I'm dying anyway.
If there's a chance it'll get you water, it's worth it.
Are you nuts?
I want you to know, back at the zoo, it was never the doctors or prescriptions that kept me going.
It was always you.
Seeing you every day.
That's what kept me going.
Melman!
Wait!
Melman!
Melman!
Melman!
You going to mope like this all day?
Don't "hmph" me.
Listen, Zuba.
A miracle happened.
Our son came back to us.
How come that is not good enough for you?
What are you saying, woman?
We lost him once, Zuba.
Let's not lose him again.
Zuba!
- Zuba!
- Get out of here!
What do you want?
It's awful.
The watering hole is dried up.
Dried up?
That's impossible!
There's nothing left!
You're alpha lion, Makunga.
What are you gonna do about it?
Your son, Alakay, he said he could fix it.
He's gone upriver.
- Off the reserve?
!
- No!
I tried to stop him.
I told him it was suicide.
He was determined to prove himself to you.
You stay here, in case he comes back!
Hurry, Zuba!
I'm so parched.
Is this place starting to freak you out?
We'll slip in, find the problem.
Hunters will never know we were here.
Why are we doing this?
Maybe my dad will think I'm...
I want to show him I'm a real lion.
As opposed to a chocolate lion.
I know this may sound hard to believe, but apparently, lions don't dance.
What?
!
As far as my dad is concerned.
As far as people are concerned, you're a hit.
In New York.
This is Africa...
much tougher crowd.
Marty, this is it!
This is the clog!
Oome on.
Well, there's the water.
Stay down.
Look at that.
Knit one, purl two.
It's her.
- Is this right?
- Very good.
Nana, slow down.
You're a little tangled, aren't you?
No, don't pull.
I'll do it.
We need dynamite.
Got any?
Oh, snap!
I just used my last stick this morning!
- Savages!
- Evasive maneuvers!
- Serpentine, serpentine!
- Squiggly squid maneuver!
Zag, zig-zag, zig ziggy zag!
No, no!
Squiggly squid!
Etch A Sketch!
That's too complex!
Octopus, octopus!
- Run, Marty!
- I can't leave you here!
Go get help!
Squiggly squid maneuver!
Go!
Go!
Squiggly squid!
Etch A Sketch!
Etch A Sketch!
Save us We love you
OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- Save us
- Melman
- We love you
- Melman
Save us
OK, here we go.
OK, OK.
- Melman
- We love you
- Melman
- Save us
Here we go!
Here we go!
- What's all the hoopla about?
- Joe?
Joe the Witch Doctor?
We thought you were dead!
So did I. Then I realized I'm covered in brown spots.
So Melman's not dying!
- Melman's not dying!
- Oh, no!
Melman!
Move!
Don't do this!
Julien, stop this!
This is crazy!
Oh, suddenly throwing a giraffe into a volcano to make water is crazy!
Yes!
- Please, Melman!
Stop!
- Gloria?
- You can't do this!
- Why not?
Because...
You can't do this, Melman.
First, that hurts.
Second, I've only got 18 hours to live, anyway.
Melman, I gotta know did you mean those things you said about me?
Of course I did.
- That's crazy.
- It is?
It's crazy to think I had to go halfway around the world to find out the perfect guy for me lived right next door.
Then it's you and me, neighbor.
You and me for the next 18 hours.
I'll take whatever you got.
- Maurice, what happened?
- I believe the fat lady has sung.
- What's going on here?
- Marty!
Alex is in big trouble!
We got to get upriver fast!
- What about the plane?
- Perfect!
Oome on!
The plane won't be fixed until the suits meet our demands.
Now, maternity leave.
Maternity leave?
You're all males.
We need that plane for a rescue mission.
There's nothing I can do until we bust up this union.
I'll bust up all of you if you don't get this plane going.
Oan't you see these commies have my hands tied?
No maternity leave.
Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want these blowing around on the savanna.
All right.
You get your maternity leave.
Finally.
Where we headed?
What's going on?
Where are we going?
Oh, no!
Please!
Don't put me there!
No!
This is wrong.
You see?
You are survivors.
Now, how about a nice lion casserole?
You can't eat a lion.
Don't worry, it tastes like chicken.
No, no, no.
Don't listen to her.
She's out of her mind, people!
I'm from New York Oity!
It's me, Alex the lion!
From Oentral Park!
Dad!
What were you thinking, son?
You got no business being out here!
Stay behind me.
They're New Yorkers.
They're just rude and frightened people.
Stay back!
You'd let your dinner get away?
- What are you doing?
- The only thing I know how to do.
What the heck?
Hey, I know those moves.
Alex?
- It's Alex the lion!
- From Oentral Park!
It is Alex!
Only one lion can move like that!
He's beautiful.
I can't believe it.
How does he do that?
What are you doing?
I'm dancing with my son!
I think.
Don't think, Dad.
Feel!
Butterfly!
I'm feeling it!
I'm feeling it!
Roar!
That was beautiful.
Now let's eat!
Dad, look out!
What the...
Alex!
Get in!
She's got a gun!
Get out while we can!
- What?
- She's got a gun!
Get out while we can!
Pass it on!
He said let's have some fun and take out the dam.
Basset hound.
Skipper!
Alex wants to take out the dam.
All right!
But it's his funeral.
- Hard to port!
- Aye-aye, Skippy!
Bring it on!
Bring it on!
Oome back!
That's my dinner!
Kowalski, full throttle.
Music!
- I like this song.
- It never gets old.
It does have a catchy hook.
Oome about!
Bring her in low!
Hold onto your skirts!
It's dam-busting time!
Hold on tight, baby!
Here we go!
Tell them no!
Pull up!
They'll kill us!
There's got to be another way!
Pass it on!
They say no pull up.
Kill us.
There's no other way.
Basset hound.
Are you sure?
Men, there is no sacrifice greater than someone else's.
No!
Medic!
Ramming speed!
Bring it on!
Bad kitties.
I don't know why the sacrifice didn't work.
The science seemed so solid.
I'd jump right in that volcano if I wasn't so good at whistling.
It's you!
I found you!
Mort?
Bad fishy!
I wonder if the gods like seafood.
Let's find out.
Look, Maurice.
- That was quick.
- I did it!
I did it!
I did it!
Ok, you did it!
Oh, yes!
Look!
- It's Alakay!
- It's Zuba!
You did it!
Alakay, Zuba, you did it!
Zuba!
Alakay!
You're back!
I'm so glad you're safe!
Out of my way.
Well, well, well.
You know, Zuba, if I remember correctly, you quit the pride.
And you were kicked out.
So don't think that this changes anything.
You're right.
In fact, we humbly present you with this token of appreciation.
A man bag.
Very popular where I'm from.
- Don't know what to say.
- Still be tough and carry your stuff.
Does the strap adjust?
This will go very nicely for me when I go out hiking.
But you're still banished.
We figured you'd say that.
My handbag!
You bad kitty!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
You deserve this, son.
Welcome to the pride.
Thanks, Dad.
But this belongs to you.
No, son.
To us!
My son!
The King of New York!
That's my baby!
Love transcends all differences.
We are gathered here today to celebrate such a love.
Do you take each other, for better or for worse?
For better, please.
What a beautiful, weird couple!
That's not going to last.
Oan I kiss the bride?
No!
Music!
- Struts.
- Oheck.
- Flaps!
- Oheck.
- Diamonds and gold.
- Oheck.
- Bye-bye!
- We'll miss you!
See you later!
We'll be back after the honeymoon in Monte Oarlo, or whenever the gold runs out.
Oome back soon!
Mom, let them take their time.
New York isn't going anywhere, right, guys?
You're right about that!
As long as I'm with her and you two, I don't care where we are.
She has the most amazing laugh.
Love has no boundaries!
Looks like you're stuck with us for a while.
Dad?
What's wrong?
I just thought we could hang out a bit and...
- You got me!
- I got you, son!
You got me with my thing.
You brought it back around on me.
I got you, son!
The old man's not too bad, eh, Marty?
- Marty?
Who's Marty?
- Oome on.
- I don't know no Marty.
- You can't fool me.
Ain't no Marty here.
Marty!
I can look into your eyes, and I know it's you.
See, I've been traveling Been traveling forever
But now that I found a home feels like I'm in heaven
See, I've been traveling Been traveling forever
But now that I'm home
Hey!
Shake the hot things!
Shake the hot things!
Shake 'em!
Shake 'em!
Shake 'em!
Well done boys.
It looks like ice cold sushi for breakfast.
No, no son.
Over here.
See the lion, look at the lion, you get the lion.
Now son, if you are going to grow up and be like your daddy someday you got to learn how to fight.
Alakay, let me show you something, OK?
You see this mark?
You and me are the same and when you're bigger, you are gonna be alpha lion just like your daddy.
Now, let me see you fight.
Ready?
No Alakay, no dancing.
You just amuse yourself, don't you?
You are a strange kid.
You are a strange man.
Oh come on, let's try it again.
It's so disappointing when they don't grow up the way you want it to.
Oh come on.
You are not challenging me again, are you?
Look on the bright side Zuba.
After I defeat you and take over as alpha lion, you will have so much more time to spend with your pathetic excuse of a son.
Before I kick your butt, let me ask you, why do you even want to become the alpha lion?
I am better looking, I have better hair, I am deceivingly smart and...
I want everyone else to do what I say.
We'll fight on three.
One.
Pay attention Alakay.
Daddy gonna show you how it's done.
Two, three.
Who is alpha lion?
You are.
Don't you forget it.
And that Alakay is how you attack.
Alakay?
That's it.
Here kitty kitty.
Ah, this one is a beauty.
It will be worth a few bucks.
It just gets easier and easier.
Daddy!
Alakay, Alakay, Alakay!
Daddy!
No, no, no!
Alakay!
Daddy!
Alakay!
Daddy got you, hold on.
Daddy!
Alakay!
Daddy!
MADAGASCAR 2 Subtitles by LalCan...
I don't like looks of this guy.
Well, I think he is kind of cute.
I think he is kind of show off.
You think he is cute?
The king of New York City.
Alex the lion!
I still think he is kind of a show off.
You got to give it to him, the guy is an animal.
Maybe you should take a break.
You know, we could all use a vacation.
Come on.
Where on earth would we go on vacation.
I don't know about you but I wanna go to Connecticut.
On the loose, several animals including the world famous Alex the lion the king of New York escaped from the Central Park Zoo tonight.
The escapees were finally cornered in Grand Central Station.
It was a very bad kitty.
Animal rights activists who convinced zoo officials to have the escaped animals sent to Africa were stunned to learn that the shipping freighter carrying the animals was reported missing today.
Tonight hundreds of New Yorkers have gathered at the Central Park Zoo to mourn the loss of their beloved zoo animals.
The question on everyone's mind:
where are they now.
I like to move it, move it!
He likes to move it, move it!
She likes to move it, move it!
We like to?
Move it!
We are gonna miss you little fuzz buckets.
You guys had been a great crowd.
Glad we can introduce you to the toilet.
If you ever come to look at Central Manhattan, feel free to call first.
Seriously no, call.
OK?
Settle down, settle down everybody.
Ssh...
Be quite.
You can't leave without this.
Hey.
Surprise freaks!
Look.
Shake it, shake it.
Yeah, I am a lady, I am a lady everyone.
I am a lady.
Not really, it's me, it's King Julien.
Which of you was attracted to me?
Hands up.
Hey freaks!
You will be very glad to hear that I am coming with you.
Oh no, thank you.
Yes thank you.
It's my plane.
Until I return with the spoils from the new country Stevie will be in charge.
I don't think they liked that idea so much Julien.
What is that you are saying Stevie?
Oh, oh, no!
What?
Really?
No, you didn't say that.
Oh it's not even possible.
Stevie says:
Let them eat the cake!
King Julien wait for me.
I'm all packed.
I have such a whole itinerary plan.
Oh no.
It's Mort.
He's so annoying.
Don't let him on.
Stop that thing, he is carrying scissors and hand cream.
Everybody in quickly.
Get in.
Get in.
Get in quick.
Get in quick.
Struts.
Checked.
Fillets.
Checked.
Engine.
Checked.
Coffee mate.
Checked.
Oopsie daisy.
That is got to be the second biggest slingshot I have ever seen.
But it is got to have to do.
Attention.
This is your captain speaking.
In the event of a water emergency, place the vest over your head then kiss your life good bye!
New York City, here we come baby.
[Skipper] ...sit back, relax and pray your personal gods that this hunk of junk flies.
Personal god, hunk, what?
We are going sir.
Open the door.
I am outside.
In case of losing cabin pressure, please place the mask over your face to hide your terrified expressions from the other passengers.
Excuse me miss.
But aren't these supposed to be attached to my seat.
No sir.
OK. boys.
Launch.
Launch.
Launch.
Launch.
Melman!
Hey, Mort.
Hi.
That was weird.
Hey, somebody is dreaming ha?
I think I just saw Mort on the wing of the plane.
You got Madagascar on the brain.
... it was quite a, it was incredible, wasn't it?
I think we will see much more fun the further way we get from.
Yeah, like when you beat me on the butt?
I am gonna take that, that thing you are holding on to and I am going to use it, on stage.
So all part of my little actor's salad bar of emotional tidbits.
Are the butts next to the crutons at the salad bar?
You don't need to be sarcastic Marty.
Hey guys, you know, I was thinking.
When we get back, I might assign up for the breeding program.
Breeding program?
I think we all reach a point on our lives when we wanna meet somebody, you know settle down, have a relationship.
I see that.
What?
Like, like dating?
Yeah, dating!
Other, other...
Other guys?
What do you mean "other guys"?
Darn it!
I'm gonna, what is holding up that beverage service.
I'm gonna go and check.
Oh, yeah ya, keep talking.
I'm gonna catch a few wings.
Did you see that?
It is so funny.
I like laughing.
It is such a nice experience.
To laugh.
Do you mind going back?
This is first class.
It's nothing personal, it's just that we are better than you.
Hey Maurice.
I'm awful, hit me, hit me.
Is it Vivaldi?
Hey, in flight slave.
Can I help you Mr. Mankiewicz?
Bring me my nuts, on a silver plate.
We just wanted to check on the drinks we ordered.
Oh, sorry.
We are in a little backed up.
Then I guess I am gonna back to..
Hey, what happened to your body?
You are freaking me out.
And can you please go over there please.
Thank you very much.
Whatever happened to the separation of the classes.
Yeah, I am sure is all democracy thing is just affeered.
Skipper, look.
Analysis.
It looks like a small incandescent bulb designed to indicate something out of the ordinary.
Like a malfunction.
I found it pretty and somewhat hypnotic.
That too sir.
Right.
Rico, manual.
Problemo solved.
Sir, we may be out of fuel.
What makes you think that?
We lost engine one.
And engine two is no longer on fire.
Buckle up boys.
Don't look dull.
This might get hairy.
Attention.
This is your captain speaking.
I've got good news and bad news.
The good news is, we will be landing immediately.
The bad news is, we are crush landing!
When it comes to air travel, we know you have no choice what so ever.
But thanks again for choosing air penguin.
Raise your arms Maurice.
It's more fun when you raise your arms like this.
I can fly.
This could be it Marty.
I just want you to know that you are truly a one in a million friend.
Thanks buddy.
You are the best ever.
I know you won't mind when I tell you...
Come on.
Tell me it, tell me, tell me what?
I broke your iPod!
What!
The button were so small.
It made me mad.
I'm sorry.
I'm gonna kill you!
I love you Gloria, I always have!
Like ah...
Like you love the beach or a good book.
Or the beach.
My goodness doll, you are shaking like a leaf.
Rico, you had your fun.
Haul up!
Gear down.
Gently now.
You just wanna kiss the ground.
Just a little pack, smooch like a kiss...
I said kiss it!
Now, just a little break.
Just a touch, a little whisper.
I believe that's checkmate.
Immersed emergency landing procedure.
Flaps up!
Deploy!
Oh, we are here.
What in the world?
What happened to the plane?
OK.
I'm OK.
OK.
I'm alive.
See, I can't even sleep for a minute.
You know what, this is not JFK.
Kowalski, casualty report.
Only two passengers unaccounted for, Skipper.
That's a number I can live with.
Good landing boys.
Who says a penguin can't fly.
Hey, happy slappers.
Is there some reason to celebrate?
Look at the plane.
We'll fix it.
Fix it?
How you gonna fix this?
Grit, spit and a whole lotta duct tape.
We should be up and running in say, six to nine months.
Sixty nine months?
No!
Six to nine months.
Kowalski, I say we use this setback to our advantage.
Where do you get, where do you pull that number out of, huh?
I want you to reconfigure the design, so start reconfiguring!
Great, that's a great...
How do you estimate that?
You!
Pretty boy!
Why don't you and your friends dig a tree, maybe find water.
Hold on, hold on a second.
Who made you king of the plane wreck?
Excuse me.
Fine, you can be in charge.
You fix the plane!
Who gives you the authority to put me in charge?
OK then, I'll remain in charge.
Yeah, that's right.
You will remain in charge.
You and your little happy friends can stay out of our hair.
Correctamundo!
Because I decided to.
Good for you.
Yeah, well guess what this discussion isn't over.
Higher mammals, you stay with us.
We could use your front cortexes and apposable thumbs.
Feel crushed wash your hands out with soap.
How, in the..
Hello!
are they gonna fix this plane?
You know, grit 'n spit and spit, once spit and griten.
Stick to it at mist.
They don't sound too promising.
You're right.
Right, we are stuck here.
Hey guys, as long as we're together we'll be OK.
Yeah, yeah but love ain't gonna get us home.
Behold, the lion!
Hey, it's people.
OK.
There is much to see, moving on.
People.
Wait, wait.
Wait people.
Hey wait, if you stop we'll autograph those.
I know you.
You.
It's that bad kitty.
How do you like some other?
Right in the batteries!
You think that old lady can't take care of you?
Next time I won't go so easy on you.
Thank you dear.
Moving on.
Are you out of your mind?
We need their help, and you're arresting little old ladies?
Out of my mind?
Aha!
Who is out of my mind?
See if you can get an operator?
No problem.
Out of my mind?
We're going home.
Message A-4: the service user has brought outside of the coverage area.
Please try again later.
Oh my..
Wow...
Am I trappen?
All those zebras, like me.
Wait a minute, where are we?
San Diego.
This time I'm forty percent sure.
I know this place.
I think this is Africa.
Africa?
It's gotto be.
Our ancestral crib.
It's in our blood.
I can feel it.
No, no.
It's more than that.
It's like dejavu.
Like I've, like I've been here before.
It's like roots.
No, no.
It's like dejavu.
Like I've, like I've been here before.
How?
How?
Me, Alex.
Me and me friends.
Fly.
Fly.
In great metal bird.
Then.
Plummet.
Smash ground.
Go boom.
Then here.
We emerge.
We offer only happiness and good greetings.
Is he dancing about a plane crash.
Yeah, we just...
Yeah.
I thought.
Sorry.
You mean, you came from off the reserve.
Yeah, way off, from the Central Park Zoo actually.
Don't strain yourself.
What is going on here, what is all this have about?
They say they are from off the reserve.
That's impossible.
Only people come from off the reserve.
You look familiar, do I know you from...
How could you possibly survived the hunters.
Hunters, we didn't see any hunters.
What are you looking at?
Me?
Nothing.
This watering hole doesn't need any more mouths to feed.
So just get out of back to wherever you came from.
OK.
Was there a maybe like a manager we can talk to?
Oh, I see.
You're here to challenge me.
What?
No!
No, no.
What else would start you look on to me?
Hold on, Zuba, wait.
Don't call woman, don't you see I am trying...
Yeah, yeah...
Zuba.
Hold on.
Alakay, is that you?
No, it's Alex. "X", like New York Knicks.
- Zuba, look.
Oh, I have always had that, have had checked it out, it's really... it's kind of a beauty spot, really.
Mark.
Alright, this is a little weird.
Honey, he has come home.
What?
You've come home.
Son.
Dad.
Mom and dad.
Mom and dad.
Mom and dad.
It's my mom and dad.
I've got a mom and dad.
My baby is alive.
My son.
My son is home.
Alakay, yeah.
The pathetical son returns.
This is perfect.
I thought you hated Zuba.
No I do.
I do, I do.
I hate him.
Oh, I do.
And I am going to use Alakay.
Yes.
I am going to use him to get rid of Zuba once and for all.
Move out of the way, stand aside.
New York.
Hmm, it's a bit of a dumb.
Are you sure we are not in New Jersey?
Hello New Yorkers, your new king is here.
This calls for celebration.
Maurice, I think they like me.
You got to love a known house to take off.
Chaka chaka what?
Excuse me, excuse me.
I'm Marty.
I'm kind of new around here.
Hey Marty.
Hey, you are a good looking group.
You like to run?
Oh yeah.
Running is crackalacking.
That's right, that's right, crackalacking.
You guys are speaking my crackalacking language.
What, you don't have doctors here?
Well, not any more.
What if you catch a cold?
We go over to the die holes and we die.
OK, you guys really need a doctor.
Hey, we have an opening.
Would you be interested?
Me?
A doctor?
It's raining men, hallelujah.
You are gotto going all.
How come you don't have a man in your life.
Listen girls, Manhattan is short on two things:
parking and hippos.
Hey everybody!
I just found out that my son is a king.
The king of New York.
Show me some of your moves son.
Come on.
Don't be bashful.
Alright.
Ooh, this one always knocks them dead.
The king is mad, the king is mad.
Now, let's all welcome him back into the pride above the arms.
Welcome to the herd Marty.
Me, in a herd?
I've always wanted to be a part of a herd.
It's one for all, and all for all.
How do I look?
Technicly, a traditional witch doctor has a bone to his nose.
Don't worry, it has just a clip on it.
Voila, he's a witch doctor.
My mother would be so happy.
Look out.
I think Moto Moto likes you.
Here he comes.
I like 'em big.
I like 'em chunky.
I like 'em big.
I like 'em plumpy.
I like 'em round.
With something, something.
They like my sound.
They think I'm funky.
Goodness girl.
You're huge.
Who is your friend, or is that your butt?
Girl, you are as quick as you all have to.
So, you are Moto Moto.
The name is so nice, when you say it twice.
I kind of a like it that so.
I see you around new.
I won't be hard, because you're so plumpy.
Oops.
I hate to be a party pooper Zuba but some of the other lions are wondering when you are going to banish your son.
What are you talking about, Makunga?
It's nothing really, if their great being about who Alakay never went through the rite of passage, bla bla bla...
So, technically speaking he can't be a member of the pride, it's nonsense.
I had forgotten about the rite of passage.
What is it?
What is this rite of passage?
It's a traditional common of a ceremony where young lions earn their manes by demonstrating their skills.
Sort of a show skill, talent show, tab dale?
Yeah, sturdiness stuff.
Great informers.
I think that's up my alley guys.
If it's tradition, I want to do it.
Stud my stuff.
Earn my mane.
I want to be Alakuy.
Alakay.
Alakay.
Even better.
We'll hold the rite of passage first thing in the morning.
That's wonderful.
Good luck Alakay.
Where I come from we say:
Break a leg.
Oh, that's my boy.
Beautiful, isn't it?
Yeah.
It's amazing.
Guys, this is where we belong.
Operation tourist trap is in go.
Oh, I like that one.
That's a good one.
That works on many levels sir.
You guys are a bunch of suck ups.
That too sir.
Absolutely.
Hide.
Stations.
Stage one.
Go.
Oh no.
What've I done.
Come on, take the bait.
Stage two.
Go, go, go.
I'll give him the kiss of life.
Rico.
Rico!
Reverse.
Gas.
Music.
Oh no, stop.
Stop.
Stop.
Come back.
What is all that rock'n roll racket?
Is she dead?
No!
You hood ones!
Good heavens.
Are you OK?
Lady, I found your pocket bag.
Oh, my hand bag.
Such a good boy.
Man, I can't survive without it.
Wow, you are a one tough cookie.
Brownies, root for sixteen.
Yonkers.
OK.
Nobody panic.
The best thing we can do is stay together.
We'll wait for another tour jeep.
It may take hours and it's getting dark but...
Where are you going?
I'm not gonna stay out in the opening get attacked by more animals.
I'm too old to die.
I don't know about you guys but I'm going with her.
Please!
We need to stay...
together.
Fine, we'll go that way.
Does anyone want a hot candy?
Easy now.
Watch your step.
And this, right here.
OK.
Are you ready?
This is where you always slept.
Oh man!
Was this mine?
Look at you.
Look at him honey.
Oh my.
Oh this thing.
Look, look.
I remember this.
You remember.
Harder than I...
You never slept on the right end.
You always slept on the bottom end.
Was that, was that my?
Is that me?
You had the cutest little paws.
Little bit of paws.
You did that the day we lost you.
Wow.
I was so young.
What happened to me?
It was all my fault.
I turned my back for a minute and...
It was not your fault.
Your father did everything he could.
He tracked those hunters for weeks.
Far off the reserve.
Finally I had to assume that the hunters...
Well...
We thought, we thought they killed you.
But my son fought those hunters off ha?
Don't mess with the king of New York.
That's right.
Alright, alright boys.
Be careful.
Watch out before you break something.
You used to call this Fufi.
Fufi?
Fufi.
Oh, he doesn't want that thing.
Give my Fufi.
Zuba, you'd better give him his Fufi.
I mean no, thank you, thank you.
It's perfect.
Well son, you get your rest, you'll have a big day tomorrow.
You're gonna need all your strength.
I'm gonna bring the house down for you dad.
I hope so, otherwise your father would have to banish you.
Oh gee, not really?
I know you're gonna do us proud.
You know why?
You were born with it.
Good night Alakay.
My boy, my own boy.
My son is a king.
My son is a king.
Good night mom.
Good night Alakay.
No sign of civilization.
Everybody appears very tired.
I think we're lost.
Hey Nana, do you even know where you are going?
No, but I'm going with a skip in my step and a smile on my face.
Sure, right, OK.
Yeah, alright.
It's people.
Where do you come from?
How could we get out of here?
Can you help us, we're lost?
We are lost too.
It was awful, a flash of black and white never gone.
They took the jeep, everything.
That happened to our jeep too.
What are we gonna do?
Only hope to survive out here!
No food, no water, no shelter.
What are we gonna do?
You can let nature get the best of you, or you can get the best of nature.
Gather around children.
We are New Yorkers, right?
Yeah.
We survived in a concrete jungle.
If we need food, we hunt for a decent hotdogs stand, am I right?
She is right.
If we need shelter, we build skyscrapers.
If we need water, we build a dam.
Come on, we're New Yorkers.
If we can make it there, we can make it anywhere.
I'm coming King Julien.
Skipper, we have all the parts we need but we're slightly behind schedule.
How slightly?
Six to nine years.
Sixty nine years?
No six to nine years.
Privates, what happened to our thumbs?
Haven't seen them since yesterday sir.
Damn you...
Nobody goes AWOL on my watch.
Private, you are coming with me.
Rico, you are coming with me.
I'm tracking down to bring them for the court marshall.
That won't be necessary.
We have recruited a few extra thumbs for you, Skipper.
Floppy of monkeys entered.
I doubt that.
Enough wallin' gagging now let's get to work.
We'll divide into three groups.
Group alpha, you are charged in seeping of fabrication.
Group Offset, you'll handle assembly.
Group George Report: you'll handle gas services.
Any questions?
Good, then let's get to work.
I'd like to kiss you monkey man.
Alright but you are so darn ugly.
Alright, so little cubs cats, just remember great dance performance comes from the heart.
Just comes straight from your heart and you never go wrong.
Sure Mr. Hey Alakay, I just happened to walk by and wanted to wish luck.
You're not nervous, are you?
No, it's my thing.
You know.
It's kind of what I do.
In my opinion; the key of this whole thing is choosing the right competitor.
Oh, you mean this is like a dance battle, sort of thing?
Like a dance off?
Sure.
Great, I loved that.
Freestyle, put your moves out.
Who do you thing would be a good match for me?
You know, just to keep the things interesting.
Well...
I wish I could help, but that's strictly against to our ancient tradition and although we hold secret but
If I was me out there, I'd choose Titsy.
Titsy, OK?
Sounds interesting.
Makunga, right?
Thank you.
Anything for Zuba's boy.
Go, get him tight.
Shake it out.
Let us begin the rite of passage ceremony.
Come on baby, make mama proud.
Oh woman, I'm trying to take care of passage here.
Got it mom.
So who will be the first participant?
Me, me me...
How about you, the tall, handsome one?
Right there, yeah.
Choose your opponent.
Let me see.
I guess I'll pick Titsy.
Titsy?
Why did he pick Titsy?
Oh, that's my boy, he got some gumption there.
Somebody wake him up, wake him up.
Alright, so Titsy.
Come on.
Let's do this ha?
Come on Titsy fly, Titsy fly, come on let's see your stuff.
Bring it.
Let's dance.
OK.
But it's only fair to warn you that I'm a prodigy of fupsy and robbins.
Not dance dance, fight.
Oh, dance fight.
You got it.
Is he dancing?
What is he doing?
I know that boy is not dancing.
This is even better than I thought.
Alakay, turn around.
No no pap, it's hop shuffle ball change, hip swish, turn around.
Oh no.
Alakay.
Are you hurt?
Oh yeah, I'm.
Did I, did I win?
Oh no son, how could, I mean how could this happen?
You told us you were a king.
And a king does not get beat.
Well, I'm a king.
I'm a king in New York.
It's my stage name.
I'm like a, you know, It's for what I perform.
Perform?
No, this is horrible.
Alakay has failed the test.
Who would have ever imagine that the day Zuba would have to banish his own son.
- Zuba, no.
Zuba, yes.
Sadly the alpha lion must cast out all failures.
Then, I'm no longer the alpha lion.
Dad, what are you doing?
Dad no, you can't do this.
Who could possibly take Zuba's place?
Anyone?
Someone?
No one?
Hey.
You sir.
I guess not.
Well I, this is all very awkward, but I suppose, I could carry this tremendous burden.
Titsy, get the hat.
As your new leader, I hereby banish Alakay he shell wear this hat of shame and leave the watering hole.
For a thousand years or life whichever comes last.
Come on.
Shoo shoo.
Get out of here.
You should have told us son.
You should have told us that you weren't a real king.
You never told me that I have to fight anybody.
What did you expect son?
I don't know, maybe a fatherly advice, like: hey son it's a fight.
You are a lion, aren't you?
But I never fought another lion in my life.
Yeah, yes, right.
You dance.
And other stuff.
The point is, your pal, Makunga set me up back there.
I mean, none of these would happen...
If you were a real lion...
Zuba.
Yeah, I said it.
A real lion?
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Saw, stitcher.
Swallow.
You're in my light Steaven.
Oh, say.
You've got a brown spot there on your shoulder.
Yeah, that's very observative of you Steven.
As you can see, I'm covered in brown spots.
OK.
That bone will be good as new in a few weeks.
So, I don't have to pick another dying hole?
No, Timo.
You've got your whole life ahead of you.
Really?
Go out there and grab a bite of that horns.
Thank you doctor Mankiewicz.
Break a leg.
Sweet kid.
This spot looks like witch doctor's disease.
Witch doctor's disease?
That's the most ridiculous disease, I've ever heard of, Steven.
Wow...
Don't ask.
Someone has been naughty.
OK.
This one will hurt a bit.
Joe, our last witch doctor, he had a spot just like that.
Monday Joe, Wednesday no Joe.
Wednesday no Joe?
I can breathe.
Thanks doc.
So, this witch doctor's disease is a real thing?
You'll find a cure.
Hey, you got at least forty eight hours.
But I have never even heard of it.
What?
I mean, I don't have any penicillin.
I'm gonna need a catscan just to get started.
You'll have a lion looking over, they'd be happy to.
Ta daaa.
That guy has got talent.
Bet you haven't seen that one before.
This knock 'em dead in New York.
Hey, let's all give it a try.
Yeah, let's do it.
Well, hey hey hey, I know you want to but it's gonna take years of practice you get never gonna quite get a tight stream until you build up your lip muscles to the point where you can purse your lips like this.
You got it?
Ta daa...
How did you?
You guys got it right up the box.
If you can do it.
We can do it.
It's in our blood.
I always thought, I was a little bit unique.
We are unique.
Hey, we are like a force of nature.
A million points of light.
And all stripes.
Exactly the same.
Exactly the same.
Looks impressive Kowalski, but will it fly?
Yes, if we fold it here, here and here.
Nice.
Oh man, my dad thinks I'm a total loser.
I have ruined my parent's lifes.
That is definitely not crackalacking.
It's lacking in the craken my friend.
I have got to fix this.
So, there is there is something I gotto tell you.
Hey guys.
Is this place great or what?
I'd go with or what.
Oh well, I tell you what.
You're not gonna believe it but;
I got a date with Moto Moto.
Who is Moto Moto.
Oh, he's so big and handsome and big.
You know what Moto Moto means?
Twins?
It means hot hot.
Hot hot?
OK, when did you start parley in African?
It's in my blood.
Don't worry.
You can flirt around with Mr. Hot Pants after I'm gone.
What's the deal Melman?
Why am I the parade and you are the rain?
Why do you have to dry the parade under my rain?
Maybe I'll just parade myself in another part of town.
Fine by me.
By the way, the main streets mine.
Well, you can have your old stinking main streets.
And you can take your hottie tub flood and you Mr. hot, Moto Moto Jr. comes...
My hottie tub what?
What are you talking about?
Come on Melman, why don't you just tell her?
You tell, what?
Tell her, what are you talking about?
I don't know what you are talking about.
So I guess, I'll go then.
You know what, don't bother.
Don't get up in my account.
Melman, Gloria.
Hey, I thought you guys were friends.
Come on guys, Marty is absolutely right.
Marty?
Marty?
Marty!
What the heck is going on?
You are not ooh..
He was no!
I thought he...
You are not him.
He is ooh...
You thought that guy was me?
No, no, no.
I mean yes, yes.
You do guys, come on.
You thought I was him?
You guys do kind of look a little a lot you look a lot alike.
Marty you look a lot alike, come on.
You laugh alike, you talk alike, he has the same sort of speech pattern...
I mean that is a little weird.
Really, you two guys are, come on Marty.
So you're saying there is nothing unique about me, I am just like any other zebra.
No, of course you are different.
How?
How?
OK.
I can't tell you apart.
Maybe you could wear a bell or something.
I don't know.
A bell?
OK. not a bell, no bell is a bad idea.
No, no, no.
How about a t-shirt that says: "I'm with stupid."?
I am not stupid.
Not you stupid, him stupid!
You know what?
While you have been off doing prancing pony with the new pussy.
I have been having pretty much the worst day of my life, OK?
It's always about you, isn't it?
My problems are just a little bit bigger than yours Marty.
All right, I couldn't tell you apart.
So what?
Yeah fine, run away Marty!
Run away.
That's what you do best, just like back in New York!
I'm right here.
But you can't tell that right?
Your one in a million friend hopes you enjoy your bigger than everyone else's problems, alone!
Good, leave!
I don't need you to help me solve my problems.
You know what?
You diame dust I can't tell which one is Marty.
Oh, which one is Marty?
Wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah!
I don't care.
Nice hat, you show off!
Marty don't go.
Look Maurice.
Here is the perfect spot for my semi-palace, so please fill in all these holes and relocate the roofed.
Oh, who'd leave a perfectly good head lying around.
What a waste.
Tell me about it.
I'm in my prime here.
I'm terminal, you know.
Probably only have another two days left to live.
That's a bomber man.
Oh, if I King Julien, that's my name.
Only had two days left to live.
I'd do all the things I have ever dreamed of doing.
Like what?
I'd love to became a professional whistler.
I pretty amazing that I did know.
But I wanna get luck even better.
I'd make my living out of it.
You know what else I'd do?
I'd invade a neighboring country and impose my own ideology even if they didn't want it.
It's easy for you to say, you are a king.
Yes.
And you are only just a sad little head.
But there must be something you want to do before you die.
Well...
There is this one thing.
What is it?
Tell me.
Well.
No, I couldn't.
I mean.
What is it?
You know, I just never really have the guts to tell Gloria, how I think about her.
What is it?
I don't really have the guts to tell Gloria, how I feel about her.
What is it?
I have always felt about her.
Fine, don't tell me!
Is it a woman?
Oh, you didn't tell me we are talking about a woman.
What are you afraid of?
You are dead man anyway, come on.
Yeah?
Yeah...
Yeah, you are right.
Well, you gotta march right up to this woman, right?
You look her right in the eye, you lean forward, right?
Just a little, almost all the way.
Then you let her, like, lean forward, just a little bit until you're just a lips distance away from each other.
And then you just tell her, how much you hate her.
Actually, it's, it's more like love her.
Oh, you slave dog.
You're a real player, you know that?
Now listen to me.
You gotto raise up.
I can't hear you.
Yeah.
Good.
You gotto raise up.
You gotto get out of the hole.
I'm raising up on the ground.
He's raising Maurice.
I'm raising Maurice.
You gotto go right up to this woman.
Yeah.
You gotto go right up to a fight.
Yeah, I tell her.
And then you gotto say:
Baby, I dig you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm gonna do it.
I'm gonna do it.
I love that happy little head.
She loves me.
She loves my eyes.
She loves me.
She loves my ass.
She loves my roundness.
She loves that I'm chunky.
She loves that I'm plumpy.
She loves my healthiness.
She loves my zestiness.
She loves me restlessly.
She loves me forever.
She loves me, because she loves me.
Moto Moto before things get too serious, well I was wondering if I were to for example stay here I'd like to ask you Let your candy lips bring the messages to my ear canal.
Well I don't know, I have so many questions.
Well I promise, the answer will always be yes unless, no is required.
OK.
So, what is it about me that you find so interesting?
Oh, you're the most plumpiness girl I've ever met.
OK.
Other than that?
Let's see, you, you know, you are chunky.
Right.
Oh, my gosh girl you are huge.
You've said that.
Oh, yes right.
We don't have to talk no more.
Gloria!
Gloria?
Melman?
Melman, I want you to meet with Moto Moto.
Ah, Moto Moto.
Yeah.
Nice to, nice to meet you.
Well, I guess, I...
It's OK.
Melman.
Apology accepted.
Oh, yeah, right, yes.
That, yes, that's why I...
Good.
Oh, OK.
That's well, that's it then.
You good, we're kind of a busy here man.
No!
No, that's not it!
Listen Mototo, you'd better treat this lady like a queen.
Because you my friend, you found yourself the perfect woman.
If I was ever so lucky to find the perfect woman, I would give her flowers every day.
And not just any flowers, OK?
Her favorites are orchids.
White.
And breakfast in bed.
Six loaves of wheat toast with butter on both sides.
No crusts.
The way she likes it.
I'd be her shoulder to cry on and her best friend and I'd spend every day trying to think of how to make her laugh.
She has the most most amazing laugh.
Well, I mean.
That's what I would do, if I were you.
But I'm not.
So you do it.
Oh, OK.
What?
That was beautiful.
Anyways, where were we?
I'm huge.
Surprised to see me Makunga?
Well I'm here to set things straight.
Like a real lion.
Is this real enough for you?
How about this?
This is for setting me up.
This is for stealing my dad's job.
This is for humiliating my family.
And making me fun like a fool.
Had enough?
Sure fly away.
Coward.
The water, it's gone.
Oh no.
The watering hole has never gone dry before.
We're gonna need a lot more dying holes.
How could this happen?
Out of my way.
What is going on here?
The watering hole is dried up, there's barely enough water for one of us.
Yes, good observation Shirley.
I'm Boby.
Makunga what will we do?
Quiet!
Listen up.
I'm afraid there is only one solution to this horrible crisis.
We'll all have to fight for it.
Fight for it?
This is crazy.
That's not fair, you'd win.
Exactly Shirley.
I'm Boby.
Sorry folks, but life isn't fair.
I'm in charge now.
Thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion.
Please Makunga this is the only water on the reserve.
If you're thirsty you'll have to look for water off the reserve.
I left the reserve and survived.
I could do something about this.
Looks like a clogged pipe.
But we get in New York all the time.
I'll just travel up river.
Up river?
Off the reserve?
You?
Yeah me.
I'll unclog the pipe and bring back your water.
Great I'll help you pack but by the looks of that hat I see you're all set.
Yeah fine.
Go ahead laugh.
Laugh your mane off.
I'm gonna prove you're wrong.
May be you should try a little rain dance.
Zuba would know what to do.
Where is Zuba?
You don't care about us.
Zuba should be in charge, not you.
Alright, fine.
As an added measure, I will consult with Zuba.
Marty?
Marty?
Is Marty here?
Marty, I apologize to you.
I did wrong.
I'm sorry.
I overlooked your problems.
At that moment I realized that I was wrong, actually.
What kind of a friend does that make me?
Pretty lousy friend I guess.
Well I just want you to know that you're one in a million.
Isn't this touching?
This is touching.
So could you please turn around so I can tell you that to your face?
That's right.
Got you.
I see you in there.
Yeah yeah you.
That's right you, right there.
Twelfth row, two hundred and third from the left.
I see you Marty.
I know it's you.
You know what makes you special?
These guys...
They're white with black stripes.
You're black with white stripes.
You're a dreamer Marty.
Always have been.
You have a great taste in music and horrible taste in friends.
Not Melman and Gloria, me.
OK.
I'm in.
No Marty.
You can't come with me.
I don't believe you have a choice.
Any water?
No, just more diamonds and gold.
OK.
Don't give up hope.
Listen up.
I'll help you.
There is only one way to get your precious water.
I, your beloved King Julien, must simply make a small sacrifice to my good friends, water gods.
In the volcano.
What does that do?
What does that do?
Excellent question.
My sacrifice goes into volcano.
Then the friendly gods eat up my sacrifice.
Mmm..
Very nice.
Thank you for the sacrifice.
Please have another sacrifice.
No, I've had enough for the day.
Listen, I'm gonna be very unsettled unless you will have another...
I don't want another sacrifice, OK?
Look at you, you look skinny.
No, I think I've had enough, is that clear?
The gods eat the sacrifice, they are grateful, they give me some of their water.
Then I give it to you.
What?
Does it work?
No.
I mean yes.
Well, Maurice?
Yeah, it's fifty fifty.
Excellent.
Now, all I need is someone who'd like to go in the volcano and get eaten by gods.
Any hands?
Hands?
Anybody?
OK.
I need someone, perhaps who has never fall in love.
Who could look death, straight in the eye ball.
A real genuine hero.
I'll do it.
Melman?
Hurry up.
Before you all come to your senses.
Melman, what is wrong with you?
I'm dying anyways.
If there is a chance, it'll get you water, it'll be worthy.
Are you nuts?
Gloria, I just want you to know, back at the zoo, it was never the doctors or the prescriptions that kept me going it was always you.
Seeing you every day.
That's what kept me going.
Melman, wait.
You gonna mop around like this all day?
Don't hmph me.
Listen Zuba.
A miracle happened.
Our son has come back to us.
How come, that is not good enough for you?
What are you saying woman?
We've lost him once Zuba.
Let's not lose him again.
Zuba!
Zuba.
Get out of here.
What do you want Makunga?
It's awful.
The watering hole is dried up.
Dried up?
That's impossible.
There is nothing left.
Well, you are the alpha lion Makunga.
What are you gonna do about it?
Your son, Alakay.
He said he could fix it.
He has gone up river.
Off the reserve?
No!
I tried to stop him.
I told him it was suicide but he was determined to prove himself to you.
You stay here in case he comes back.
Hurry Zuba.
I'm so parched.
Is this place, aren't affright you out?
We'll slip in, find the problem.
Hunters'll never know we were here.
Why are "we" doing this?
Look, Marty maybe my dad'll think that I'm...
I just wanna show him, I'm a real lion.
As opposed to a chocolate lion.
I know this might sound hard to believe, but apparently lions don't dance.
What?
As far as my dad's concerned.
As far as the people is concerned, you're a huge hit.
That was New York.
This is Africa.
It's a much tougher crowd.
Marty, Marty.
This's it.
This is the clog.
Come on.
Here's the water.
Marty, stay down.
Look at that.
It's her.
Is this right?
Oh, very good.
We need dynamite, do you have any dynamite?
Oh, snap, I just used my last...
Alex!
Run Marty.
Come on, I can't leave you here.
Go, get help.
OK.
OK.
OK...
OK.
Here we go.
OK...
Here we go.
Here we go.
What is all the hoop about?
Joe?
Joe, the witch doctor?
We thought you were dead.
So did I. Then I realized, I'm covered in brown spots.
So, Melman's not dying.
Melman's not dying.
Excuse me, excuse me.
Melman!
Move out.
Don't do this.
Julien, stop this.
This's crazy!
Oh, certainly throwing a giraffe into a volcano to make water is crazy.
Yes!
Please, Melman stop.
Gloria?
You can't do this.
Why not?
Because I...
You can't do this Melman.
First of all, it hurts.
Second of all, I'll only have eighteen hours to live anyway.
Melman, I gotto know.
Did you really mean all those things you said about me?
Of course I did.
This is crazy.
It is?
It's crazy in the thing, I had to go half way around the world to find out that the perfect guy for me lived right next door.
Then I guess it's you and me neighbor you and me for the next eighteen hours.
I'll take whatever you got.
Maurice, what just happened?
I believe the fat lady has sobbed.
Hey, what's going on here?
Marty.
Hey, listen up.
Alex is in big trouble.
We get to get up the river fast.
What about the plane?
Perfect.
Come on.
The plane won't be fixed until the suits meet our demands.
Now, about maternity leave.
Maternity leave?
You're males.
Look, we need a plane for rescue mission.
Well, there is nothing I can do until we bust up this union.
I'm gonna get the busty not bully you if you don't get this plane going.
Can't you see these commies have my hands tied here?
No maternity leave.
Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want these blowing around on the savannah.
Alright, you get your maternity leave.
Finally.
Where are you headed?
What's going on?
Where are we going?
Oh no, please.
You are not gonna burn me there.
No, no, no.
This's wrong.
You see?
You are survivals.
Now, how about a nice lion casserole?
We can't eat a lion.
Don't worry, taste like chicken.
No, no, no, no.
Don't listen to her.
She is out of her mind.
People.
I'm from New York City too.
It's me, Alex the lion.
From Central Park.
Dad.
What were you thinking son?
You got no matter be not here.
This's it, I want you to stay behind.
Look dad, they're New Yorkers, they are just ruined and frightened people.
Stay back.
Are you gonna let them get away?
What are you doing son?
The only thing I know how to do.
Hey, all those moves...
Alex?
This is Alex the lion.
From Central Park.
This is Alex.
Only one lion can move like that.
This is beautiful.
I can't believe this.
How does he do that?
Dad, what are you doing?
Dancing with my son I think.
Don't think dad, feel.
Butterfly.
I'm doing it.
I'm doing it.
Oh, that was beautiful.
Now, let's eat.
Dad, look out!
What the?
Alex, get in.
She has got a gun.
Let's get out while we can.
What?
She has got a gun.
Let's get out while we can.
Pass it on.
He said, let's have some fun and take out the dam.
Pass it on.
Skipper, Alex wants to take out the dam.
Alright, but it's his funeral.
What?
Deploy.
Aye aye, Skippy.
Come back.
That's my dinner.
Kovalski, full proto.
Music.
Oh, I like this song.
It never gets old.
It does have a catchy hook.
Tell them, no, pull up.
She will kill us.
There is gotto be another way.
Pass it on.
They say, no pull up, kill us.
There is no other way.
Pass it on.
Are you sure?
There is no sacrifice greater then someone else.
No, medic!
Relic speed.
Bring it on.
Bad kitties.
I don't know why the sacrifice didn't work.
The science seem so solid.
I'd jump right in that volcano if I wasn't so good at whistling.
Oh, it's you.
I found you.
Mort?
I wonder if the gods like seafood.
Let's go find out.
Look, Maurice.
That was quick.
I did it.
I did it.
I did it.
OK.
You did it.
Oh yes.
Look.
It's Alakay, it's Zuba.
Zuba, Alakay.
You're back.
I'm so glad you're safe.
Out of my way.
Well, well, well, well, well.
You know Zuba, if I remember correctly, you quitted the pride, and you were kicked out.
So don't think for any instant that this changes anything.
You're right, in fact we humbly present you with this token of appreciation.
That is a man bag, very popular where I came from.
I don't know what to say.
You can still be tough and carry your stuff.
Does this strip adjust?
Yes.
I think this will go very nicely for me when I go out hiking.
But I'm afraid you're still banished.
We figured you'd say that.
My hand bag.
You bad kitty.
You deserve this son.
Welcome to the pride.
Thanks dad.
But this belongs to you.
No, no son, to us.
My son, the king of New York!
Love transcends all differences.
We are gathered here today to celebrate such a love.
Do you take each other, for better or for worse?
For better please.
What a beautiful weird couple.
That's not gonna last.
Can I kiss the bride Skipper?
No.
Music.
Struts?
Checked.
Fillets?
Checked.
Diamonds and gold?
Checked.
Bye bye.
We're gonna miss you.
See you later.
We'll be back after the honeymoon in Monte Carlo.
Or whenever the gold runs out.
Take cares.
Come back soon.
Hey you know mom, let them take their time.
New York is not going anywhere.
Right guys?
Yeah, you're right about that?
Well, as long as I'm with her.
And you two.
I don't care where we're.
She has the most amazing laugh.
Love has no boundaries.
Well, it looks like you're stucked with us for a while.
Dad, what's wrong?
I just thought we could hang out a bit and...
You got me.
I got you son.
You got me with my...
You did my thing.
You got a background on me.
I love it.
I got you son.
Old man is not too bad, hey Marty?
Marty?
Who's Marty?
Come on?
I don't know Marty.
Don't call me Marty.
You can't fool me.
I don't see no Marty.
Ain't no Marty here.
Marty, I can look into your eyes, and I know it's you.
Hey shake the hot thing.
Shake the hot thing.
Shake 'em.
Shake 'em.
Shake 'em.
Shake 'em...
Subtitle by Snitch Company®
Well done, boys.
Looks like ice-cold sushi for breakfast.
No, no, son.
Over here.
See the lion?
Look at the lion and get the lion.
Now, son, if you're gonna grow up and be like your daddy someday, you gotta learn how to fight.
Da-da.
Now, Alakay, let me show you something, OK?
You see this mark?
You and me are the same.
When you're bigger, you'll be Alpha Lion, just like me.
Now let me see you fight.
Ready?
No, Alakay.
No dancing!
You just amuse yourself, don't you?
You're a strange kid.
You're a strange one.
I'm...
Now, come on, let's try it again.
No, Alakay.
Stop that right now.
Doggone it!
It's so disappointing when they don't grow up the way you want.
Makunga.
You're not challenging me again, are you?
Look on the bright side.
After I defeat you and become alpha lion, you'll have more time to spend with your pathetic son.
Before I kick your butt, let me ask you:
Why do you want to become the alpha lion?
I'm better looking, I have better hair, I'm deceivingly smart and I want everyone else to do what I say.
We fight on three.
One...
Pay attention, Alakay.
Daddy will show you how it's done.
Two, three!
- Who's the alpha lion?
- You are.
Don't you forget it.
And that, Alakay, is how you attack...
Alakay?
That's it.
Here, kitty, kitty.
This one's a beauty.
He'll be worth a few bucks.
Itjust gets easier and easier.
Daddy!
Alakay!
Alakay!
Alakay!
Da-da!
No!
No!
No!
Alakay!
- Daddy!
- Daddy's got you!
Hold on!
Da-da!
Alakay!
Daddy!
I've been around the world in the pouring rain
Feeling out of place and feeling strange
Take me to a place where they know my name
'Oause I ain't met nobody that looks the same
I'm a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle
He's a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle
I'm a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle
He's a fish out of water Lion out of the jungle
I need my peoples, my peoples Take me to my peoples

Show love
Just gotta have someone Gotta have someone
To relate to, to relate to
I'm feeling right at home
Feeling right at home Feeling right at home
Feeling right at home I'm feeling right at home
See I been traveling Been traveling forever...
- I don't like the looks of this guy.
- He's kind of cute.
He's kind of a showoff.
You think he's cute?
Roar!
The King of New York Oity Alex the Lion!
I still think he's kind of a showoff.
The guy's an animal.
Maybe he should take a break.
You know, we could all use a vacation.
Oome on, where would we go on vacation?
I don't know about you, but I want to go to Oonnecticut!
On the loose, several animals, including the world famous Alex the Lion, escaped from the Oentral Park Zoo tonight.
The escapees were cornered in Grand Oentral Station.
He was a very bad kitty.
Animal rights activists, who convinced zoo officials to have the animals sent to Africa, were stunned to learn that the freighter carrying the animals was reported missing today.
Tonight, hundreds of New Yorkers have gathered at the zoo to mourn the loss of their beloved zoo animals.
The question on everyone's mind, where are they now?
I like to move it, move it
He likes to move it, move it
She likes to move it, move it
- We like to
- Move it!
Oome on!
Y'all know this one!
It never gets stale!
- We like to
- Move it!
We'll miss you little fuzz buckets!
You've been a great crowd!
Glad we could introduce you to the toilet.
If you ever come look us up in Manhattan, feel free to call first.
Seriously though, call.
OK?
Settle down, everybody.
Be quiet!
You can't leave without this!
Surprise, freaks!
Shake it!
Shake it.
Look, I'm a lady!
I'm a lady, everyone!
I'm a lady!
Not really!
It's me, King Julien!
Which of you is attracted to me?
Hands up!
Hey, freaks!
You will be very glad to hear that I am coming with you.
Oh, no, thank you.
Yes, thank you.
It's my plane!
Until I return with the spoils from the new country Stevie will be in charge!
I don't think they like that idea.
What are you saying, Stevie?
No.
Oould we...?
No, you didn't say that!
How is that even possible?
Naughty little thing!
Stevie says...
Let them eat cake!
King Julien, wait for me!
I'm all packed!
I have a whole itinerary planned!
Oh, no!
It's Mort!
He's so annoying!
Don't let him on.
Stop that thing!
He's carrying scissors and hand cream!
Everybody in!
Quickly, get in, get in!
Get in quick!
- Struts.
- Oheck.
- Flaps.
- Oheck.
- Engine.
Ooffee maker.
- Oheck.
You guys!
Oopsie-daisy!
That has to be the second biggest slingshot I've ever seen.
But it'll have to do.
Attention.
This is your captain speaking.
In the event of an emergency, place the vest over your head then kiss your... good-bye.
New York Oity, here we come!
Pray to your personal God this hunk ofjunk flies.
Personal God, hunk...?
What?
We are go, sir.
Open the door!
I'm outside!
If cabin pressure is lost, place the mask over your face to hide your terrified expression.
Miss, aren't these supposed to be attached to my seat?
- No, sir.
- OK, boys, launch!
Launch!
- Launch!
- Launch!
Gremlin!
Hey, Mort.
Hi!
That was weird.
- Somebody's dreaming.
- I think I saw Mort on the plane wing.
You got Madagascar on the brain.
I know I'm gonna miss it.
It was incredible.
I think it'll seem more fun the further we are from it.
Like when you bit me on the butt?
I'm gonna take that thing you're holding onto and use it onstage.
It's all part of my little actor's salad bar of emotional tidbits.
Are the butts next to the croutons?
You don't need to be sarcastic.
When we get back, I might sign up for the breeding program.
Breeding program?
We reach a point when we want to meet somebody.
Settle down, have a relationship.
I can see that.
What?
Like dating?
Yeah, dating.
Other... other guys?
What do you mean, other guys?
Darn it!
What is holding up that beverage service?
!
I'm gonna go check.
You all keep talking.
I'm gonna catch a few winks.
It's so funny!
I like laughing!
It's such a nice experience!
To laugh!
Do you mind going back?
This is first class.
It's nothing personal.
We're just better than you.
Maurice, I'm open!
Hit me!
- He shoots, he scores!
- Is that Vivaldi?
- In-flight slave.
- Oan I help you, Mr. Mankiewicz?
Bring my nuts on a silver platter.
We were checking on our drink order.
Sorry.
Been a little backed up.
- I guess I'll go back...
- Where's your body?
You're freaking me out!
Oan you please go over there, please?
What happened to the separation of the classes?
I'm sure this democracy thing is just a fad.
We'll go out for pineapple, my bobbly-headed boobily-boo.
Skipper, look.
Analysis.
Looks like a small bulb used to indicate something unusual, like a malfunction.
I find it pretty and somewhat hypnotic.
That too, sir.
Right!
Rico?
Manual!
Problemo solved.
- We may be out of fuel.
- Why do you think so?
We've lost engine one and engine two is no longer on fire.
Buckle up, boys.
Don't look, doll.
This might get hairy.
Attention!
This is your captain.
I have good and bad news.
The good news is, we're landing immediately.
The bad news is, we're crash-landing.
When it comes to air travel, we know you have no choice.
But thanks for choosing Air Penguin.
Raise your arms, Maurice!
It's more fun when you raise your arms!
I can fly!
This could be it, Marty!
I want you to know you are a one-in-a-million friend!
Thanks, buddy!
You're the best ever!
- And you won't mind when I tell you...
- Tell me anything!
I broke your iPod!
The buttons were so small!
It made me mad!
- The horror!
- I'm sorry!
- I'll kill you, butt-biter!
- It was an accident!
- An accident!
- Butt-biter!
I love you, Gloria!
I always have!
Like you love the beach.
Or a good book.
Or the beach.
Goodness, doll, you're shaking like a leaf.
Rico, you've had your fun.
Pull up.
Gear down.
Gently.
You just want to kiss the ground.
Just a peck, a smooch, like you'd kiss your sister.
I said, kiss it!
Now just a little brake.
Just a touch.
I believe that's checkmate.
Oommence emergency landing procedure.
Flaps up!
Deploy!
Oh, we're here.
What in the world?
What happened to the plane?
What did y'all do to the plane?
I'm OK.
I'm alive.
I can't even sleep for a minute.
This is not JFK.
Kowalski, casualty report.
Two passengers unaccounted for.
That's a number I can live with.
Good landing, boys.
Who says a penguin can't fly?
Hey, happy slappers!
Is there some reason to celebrate?
Look at the plane!
- We'll fix it.
- How are you gonna fix this?
Grit, spit and a whole lot of duct tape.
We should be up and running in, say, six to nine months.
- Sixty-nine months?
!
- No, six to nine months.
Kowalski, I say we use this setback to our advantage.
- Where'd you get that number?
- I want you to reconfigure the design.
How do you estimate that?
Pretty boy!
Why don't you and your friends dig a latrine.
Hold on.
Who made you king of the plane wreck?
Excuse me?
Fine.
You can be in charge.
You fix the plane.
Who gives you the authority to put me in charge?
OK, then I'll remain in charge.
Yeah, you will remain in charge.
You and your hippie friends stay out of our hair.
Oorrecto-mundo.
Because I decided to.
- Good for you.
- Well, this discussion isn't over.
Higher mammals!
Stay with us.
We could use your front cortexes and opposable thumbs.
Phil!
I should wash your hands out with soap.
How in the hell-o will they fix this plane?
!
You know, grit and spit and spit.
A lot of spit and grit and stick-to-it-iveness.
That don't sound too promising.
You're right.
We're stuck here.
As long as we're together, we'll be OK.
Yeah, but love ain't gonna get us home.
Behold!
The lion!
- People!
- There is much to see.
Moving on.
Wait, wait, wait!
People!
- They'll help us!
- Wait up!
- People!
Stop!
- Help us!
If you stop, I'll autograph those!
I know you!
You.
It's the bad kitty.
How do you like some of that?
!
Oome in, Tokyo!
Right in the batteries.
You think an old lady can't take care of herself?
Next time, I won't go so easy on you!
Thank you, dear.
Moving on!
Are you out of your mind?
We need help and you harass old ladies?
!
Out of my mind?
Who's out of my mind now?
- See if you can get an operator.
- No problem.
Out of my mind.
We're going home.
Message E-4.
The service user has roamed outside the coverage area.
Please try again later.
Am I trippin'?
All those zebras...
like me.
- Where are we?
- San Diego.
This time I'm 40 percent sure.
- I know this place.
- I think it's Africa.
Africa?
It's got to be.
Our ancestral crib.
It's in our blood.
I can feel it!
No, it's more than that.
It's like déjà vu, like I've been here before.
It's like Roots!
No, it's like déjà vu, like I've been here before.
How!
How!
Me Alex!
Me and me friends fly, fly in great metal bird.
Then plummet!
Smash ground!
Go boom!
Then here we emerge.
We offer only happiness and good greetings.
Is he dancing about a plane crash?
Yeah.
We just... yeah.
I thought...
Sorry.
You came from off the reserve?
Way off.
From the Oentral Park Zoo, actually.
Don't strain yourself.
What's going on here?
They say they're from off the reserve.
That's impossible.
Only people come from off the reserve.
You look familiar.
Do I know you?
How could you survive the hunters?
We didn't see any hunters.
- What are you looking at?
- Me?
Nothing.
This watering hole doesn't need any more mouths to feed.
So skedaddle back to where you came from.
Is there a manager we could talk to?
I see.
You're here to challenge me!
What?
No!
No.
That's what it looks like to me!
Zuba!
Wait.
I'm trying to take care of business...
Yeah, yeah, Zuba.
Hold on.
Alakay?
Is that you?
No, it's Alex.
Ix.
Like New York Knicks.
Zuba, look!
I've always had that.
The vet checked it out.
It's kind of a beauty spot, really.
A mark.
All right, this is a little weird.
Honey, he's come home.
What?
You've come home.
Son.
Dad.
Mom and Dad?
Mom and Dad!
Mom and Dad!
It's my mom and dad!
I got a mom and dad!
My baby's alive!
Dad!
My son!
My son is home!
Alakay!
Alakay has come home!
Alakay!
Yeah!
The prodigal son returns.
This is perfect!
I thought you hated Zuba.
No, I do.
I do.
I do.
I hate him.
Oh, I do.
And I'm going to use Alakay, yes.
I'm going to use him to get rid of Zuba once and for all!
Giddy-up, feathered horse!
Make way!
Move out of the way!
Stand aside!
New York!
It's a bit of a dump.
Are you sure we're not in New Jersey?
Hello, New Yorkers!
Your new king is here!
This calls for a celebration!
Maurice, I think they like me.
You've got to love a non-hostile takeover!
Ohukka-chukka what?
Excuse me.
I'm Marty.
I'm kind of new around here.
Hey, Marty!
You're a good-looking group!
You like to run?
Yeah.
Running is crack-a-lackin'.
That's right!
Orack-a-lackin'.
You guys speak my crack-a-lackin' language.
What?
You don't have doctors here?
Not anymore.
Well, what if you catch a cold?
We go over to the dying holes and we die.
You guys really need a doctor.
- We have an opening.
- Would you be interested?
Me?
A doctor?
It's raining men.
Hallelujah!
You all got it going on.
Why don't you have a man?
You got worms?
Oh, I got rid of those.
Listen, girls.
Manhattan is short on two things, parking and hippos.
Hey, everybody!
I just found out that my son is a doggone king!
The King of New York!
Show me some of your moves, son.
Don't be bashful.
All right.
This one always knocks 'em dead.
Roar!
Look out.
The King is mad.
The King is mad!
Let's welcome him back into the pride with open arms!
Welcome to the herd, Marty!
Me?
I've always wanted to be part of a herd!
- It's one for all...
- And all for all, y'all!
How do I look?
Technically, a traditional witch doctor has a bone through his nose.
Don't worry... it's just a clip-on.
Voilà!
He's a witch doctor!
My mother will be so happy.
Look out!
I think Moto Moto likes you.
Here he comes.
I like 'em big
I like 'em chunky
I like 'em big I like 'em plumpy
I like 'em round With something' somethin'
They like my sound They think I'm funky
Goodness, girl... you huge.
Who's your friend?
Or is that your butt?
You as quick as you are hefty.
So you're Moto Moto?
The name's so nice, you say it twice.
I kind of like it, fatso.
I'll see you around, girl.
It won't be hard, because you so... plumpy.
Oops!
I hate to be a party pooper, Zuba, but some of the lions were wondering when you plan to banish your son.
- What are you talking about?
- It's nothing, really.
They're griping that Alakay never went through the rite of passage, blah, blah, blah, so technically speaking, he can't be a member of the pride.
It's nonsense.
I forgot about the rite of passage.
What is it?
What's this rite of passage?
A traditional coming-of-age ceremony.
Young lions earn their manes by demonstrating their skills.
- A show-of-skill talent show deal?
- Yeah.
Strutting their stuff.
A performance!
I think that's up my alley.
If it's tradition, I want to do it.
Strut my stuff.
Earn my mane.
I want to be Alaki.
- Alakay.
- Alakay!
Even better.
We will hold the rite of passage in the morning!
That's wonderful!
Good luck, Alakay.
Where I'm from, we say, "Break a leg. "
That's my boy!
I'm a private dancer
A dancer for money
Any old music will do
Beautiful, isn't it?
It's amazing.
Guys this is where we belong.
Operation Tourist Trap is a go.
Oh, I like that one.
It works on many levels.
You guys are a bunch of suck-ups.
- That, too.
- Absolutely.
Stations.
Stage one.
Go!
Oh, no!
What have I done?
Oome on, take the bait.
- What happened?
- Oh, look at the poor little guy.
Is it dead?
Stage two!
Go, go, go!
I will give him the kiss of life.
Rico!
Rico!
Reverse!
Gas!
Music!
No!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Oome back!
What is all this rock'n'roll racket?
!
Is she dead?
No!
You hoodlums!
Good heavens!
Are you OK?
Lady, I found your pocketbook.
My handbag.
Such a good boy.
Nana can't survive without it.
You are one tough cookie.
Brownies Troop 416, Yonkers.
OK, nobody panic!
The best thing we can do is stay together.
We'll wait for another tourjeep.
It may take hours, but...
Where are you going?
I'm not staying here to be attacked by more animals!
I'm too old to die.
I'm going with her.
Old lady, wait up!
Please!
We need to stay together.
Fine!
We'll go that way!
Does anyone want a hard candy?
- Easy now.
- Watch your step.
And right here...
OK, are you ready?
This is where you always slept.
Oh, man!
- Was this mine?
- Look at you.
Look at him.
Oh, this thing.
Look, look!
- I remember this!
- He remembers.
A little harder than...
You never slept on the right end.
You always slept on the bottom end.
Is that...?
Is that my...?
Is that me?
You had the cutest little paws.
Little, little bitty ol' paws.
You did that the day we lost you.
Wow.
I was so young.
What happened to me?
It was all my fault.
I turned my back and...
It was not your fault.
Your father did everything he could.
He tracked those hunters for weeks.
Far off the reserve.
Finally, I had to assume the hunters well...
We thought they'd killed you.
But my son fought them off!
Don't mess with the King of New York!
- That's right!
- Keep your chin in.
You boys be careful!
Watch out before you break something.
You used to call this "foofie. "
"Foofie"?
Foofie.
He doesn't want that.
This is my foofie!
Zuba, you better give him his foofie.
I mean, no, thank you, thank you.
It's perfect.
Son, you get your rest.
You have a big day tomorrow.
You'll need all your strength.
I will bring the house down for you.
I hope so.
Otherwise, your father will have to banish you.
Jeez, Mom, really?
I know you'll do us proud.
You know why?
You were born with it.
Good night, Alakay.
My boy.
My own boy.
My son's a king.
My son's a king.
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Alakay.
Foofie.
Look at foofie!
My foofie!
Foofie, foofie, foofie.
My foofie!
No sign of civilization.
Everybody appears very tired.
I think we're lost.
Nana, do you know where you're going?
No, but I'm going with a skip in my step and a smile on my face.
Sure, right, OK.
Yeah, all right.
- It's people.
- How did you get here?
- Oan you help us?
We're lost.
- We're lost too.
It was awful.
A flash of black and white and they were gone.
They took the jeep!
- That happened to ourjeep too!
- What do we do?
How will we all survive?
No food, no water, no shelter.
What are we gonna do?
!
You can let nature get the best of you, or you can get the best of nature.
Gather 'round, children.
We're New Yorkers, right?
Yeah.
We survive the concrete jungle!
When we need food, we hunt for a decent hot dog stand.
- Am I right?
- She's right.
When we need shelter, we build skyscrapers.
- Exactly!
- When we need water, we build a dam.
We're New Yorkers, for crying out loud!
If we can make it there, we can make it anywhere!
I'm coming, King Julien!
Bad fishy!
Bad fishy!
No, shark, no!
Sit!
Why am I laughing?
We have all the parts we need, but we're slightly behind schedule.
- How slightly?
- Six to nine years.
- Sixty-nine years?
- No, six to nine years.
Private!
What happened to our thumbs?
Haven't seen them since yesterday.
Darn you, Darwin!
Nobody goes AWOL on my watch.
Private!
You're coming with me.
Rico!
You're coming with me!
- We'll bring them in for court martial.
- That won't be necessary!
We've recruited a few extra thumbs for you, Skipper.
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.
Oh, I doubt that.
Enough lollygagging.
Let's get to work.
There'll be three groups.
Group Alpha will do sheet metal fabrication.
Group Bronson handles assembly.
Group George Peppard, craft services.
Any questions?
Good!
Let's get to work.
I'd like to kiss you, monkey man.
All right, but you're so darn ugly.
Remember, little cub scouts, a great dance performance comes from the heart.
Straight from the heart, you'll never go wrong.
Sure, mister.
Hey, Alakay, I just happened to walk by, I thought I'd wish you luck.
- You're not nervous, are you?
- Nah, it's my thing.
In my opinion, the key to this is choosing the right competitor.
You mean, this is like a dance battle sort of thing?
- Like a dance-off?
- Sure.
Great.
I love that.
Freestyle.
Who'd be a good match for me?
Just to keep things interesting.
Well, I wish I could help, but that's strictly against our ancient tradition and all we hold sacred.
But if it was me out there...
I'd choose Teetsi.
Teetsi.
OK.
Sounds interesting.
Makunga, right?
Thank you.
Anything for Zuba's boy.
Go get 'em, tiger.
Shake it out.
A five, six, seven, eight.
Let's go, let's do this.
Let us begin the rite of passage ceremony.
- Oome on, baby!
Make Mama proud!
- Woman, I'm trying to take...
On it, Mom!
Who will be the first participant?
Me!
Oh!
Me, me, me!
Me!
Me!
Me!
Me, me!
Please, me?
How about you?
The tall, handsome one.
Yeah.
Ohoose your opponent.
Let me see.
I guess I'll pick Teetsi?
Teetsi?
Why did he pick Teetsi?
That's my boy!
He's got some gumption there!
Somebody, wake him up!
All right, so, Teetsi, come on.
Let's do this, huh?
Oome on, little tsetse fly.
Let's see your stuff.
Bring it.
- Let's dance!
- OK.
But let me warn you that I am a protégé of Fosse and Robbins!
Not "dance" dance!
Fight!
Dance fight!
You got it.
- Is he dancing?
- What's he doing?
I know that boy is not dancing.
This is even better than I thought.
Alakay, turn around!
No, Pop, it's hop, shuffle, ball change, hip swish, turn around.
Oh, no.
Alakay!
Are you hurt?
Yeah, I am.
Did I... did I win?
No, son.
How could this happen?
You told us you were a king.
A king does not get beat.
I am a king.
I'm the King of New York.
It's my stage name.
Like for when I perform.
Perform?
Oh, no, this is horrible!
Alakay has failed the test!
Who would have ever imagined that today Zuba would have to banish his own son?
Zuba, no.
Zuba, yes.
Sadly, the alpha lion must cast out all failures.
Then I'm no longer the alpha lion.
Dad, what are you doing?
Dad, no!
You can't do this.
Who could possibly take Zuba's place?
Anyone?
Someone?
No one?
You, sir!
I guess not.
Well, I... this is all very awkward, but I suppose I could carry this tremendous burden.
Teetsi!
Get the hat.
As your new leader, I hereby banish Alakay!
He shall wear this Hat of Shame and leave the watering hole for a thousand years, or life!
Whichever comes last.
Shoo, shoo!
Get out of here!
You should have told us you weren't a real king, son!
You never told me I'd have to fight anybody!
What did you expect?
!
I don't know!
Maybe a little fatherly advice like, "Hey, son, it's a fight!"
- You're a lion!
- But I never fought another lion!
No, I guess not.
You dance!
And other stuff!
Your pal, Makunga, set me up back there!
- None of this would have happened...
- If you were a real lion.
- Zuba!
- Yeah, I said it!
A real lion.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Saw.
Suture.
Swab.
You're in my light, Stephen.
You have a brown spot on your shoulder.
That's very observant, Stephen.
As you can see, I'm covered in brown spots.
OK!
That bone will be good as new in a few weeks.
So I don't have to pick out a dying hole?
No, you got your whole life ahead of you.
- Really?
- Go out and grab it by the horns.
- Thank you, Dr. Mankiewicz!
- Break a leg!
Sweet kid.
This spot looks like Witch Doctor's Disease.
Witch Doctor's Disease?
That's the most ridiculous disease I've ever heard of.
- Don't ask.
- Someone's been knotty.
This won't hurt a bit.
Joe, our last witch doctor, had a spotjust like that.
- And?
- Monday, Joe.
Wednesday, no Joe.
Wednesday, no Joe?
I can breathe!
Thanks, doc!
So this Witch Doctor's Disease is a real thing?
You'll find a cure.
You've got at least 48 hours!
But I've never heard of it.
I mean...
I don't have any penicillin.
I'll need a OAT scan just to get started!
Have a lion look you over.
They'd be happy to.
Ta-da!
- He has talent.
- Stupendous and tremendous.
Hollah!
Bet you've never seen that one!
Knocked 'em dead in New York!
- Let's all give it a try!
- Let's do it!
Well, you can try all you want to, but it takes years of practice.
You'll never get a tight stream until you build up your lip muscles to the point where you can purse your lips like this.
You got it?
Ta-da!
How did you...?
You guys got it right out of the box!
- If you can do it...
... we can do it.
It's in our blood!
I always thought I was a bit unique.
We are unique!
We are like a force of nature!
- A million points of light!
- And dark stripes!
Exactly the same!
Exactly the same.
Looks impressive, Kowalski, but will it fly?
Yes.
If we fold it here, here and here.
Nice.
Oh, man.
My dad thinks I'm a total loser.
I've ruined my parents' lives.
That is definitely not crack-a-lackin'.
It is lacking' in the cracking', my friend.
I've gotta fix this.
So there's...
There's something I gotta tell you.
Hey, guys.
Is this place great or what?
!
I'd go with "or what. "
Well, I'll tell you what.
You're not gonna believe it, but I got a date with Moto Moto.
Who's Moto Moto?
Oh, he's so big and handsome and big!
- Know what "Moto Moto" means?
- Twins?
It means, "Hot Hot. "
"Hot Hot"?
When did you start parlez-ing African?
It's in my blood.
Don't worry, you can flirt around with Mr. Hot Pants after I'm gone.
Melman, why am I the parade and you're the rain?
Why are you driving your parade under my rain?
Maybe I'll parade in another part of town!
Whoa, guys.
Main Street's mine!
Well, you can have it!
And you can take your hotee-tot float and Mr. Hotee Moto Moto...
- What are you talking about?
- What are we talking about?
Melman, just tell her.
What?
What are you...
I don't know what you're talking about.
I guess I'll go, then.
Don't bother.
- Don't get up on my account.
- Melman!
Gloria!
- I thought you guys were friends!
- Marty's absolutely right.
- Marty?
- Marty?
Marty?
What the heck is going on?
You're not...?
Oh!
He was...
I thought he...
You're not him.
He's...
Oh.
You thought that guy was me?
No.
I mean, yes, you...
Guys, come on.
You thought I was him?
You guys kind of do look a little...
You look a lot alike.
Marty, you look a lot alike.
You laugh alike.
Talk alike.
He has the same speech pattern.
It's a little weird, really.
I mean, come on.
Marty.
So you're saying there's nothing unique about me.
I'm just like any other zebra.
No.
Of course you're different!
How?
OK, I can't tell you apart.
Maybe you could wear a bell or something.
- A bell?
!
- OK, not a bell.
Bell's a bad idea.
How about a T-shirt that says, "I'm with stupid"?
- I'm not stupid!
- Not you, stupid!
Him, stupid!
You know, while you've been doing the prancing pony with your new posse,
I've been having the worst day of my life.
It's always about you, isn't it?
My problems are just a little bit bigger than yours.
I couldn't tell you apart.
So what?
!
Yeah, fine.
Run away, Marty!
Run away!
That's what you do best!
Just like back in New York!
I'm right here.
But you can't tell that, right?
Your one-of-a-million friend hopes you enjoy your bigger-than-anyone-else's problems alone!
Good, leave!
I don't need you to help me solve my problems!
You're a dime a dozen!
I can't tell which one's Marty!
Which one's Marty?
Wait a minute.
Oh, yeah, I don't care!
Nice hat, you showoff!
Marty don't go.
Giddy-up, giddy-up!
Look, Maurice!
The perfect spot for my summer palace!
Please fill in all these holes and relocate the riff-raff.
- Who'd leave a perfectly good head?
- What a waste.
Tell me about it.
I'm in my prime here.
I'm terminal, you know?
I probably only have another two days left to live.
That's a bummer, man.
If I, King Julien... that's my name only had two days left to live,
I would do all the things
- I've ever dreamed of doing.
- Like what?
I'd love to become a professional whistler.
I'm pretty amazing at it now, but I want to get even better, make my living out of it.
You know what else I would do?
I would invade a neighboring country and impose my own ideology, even if they didn't want it!
Easy for you to say.
You're a king.
Yes.
And you are only just a sad little head.
There must be something you want to do before you die!
- There is this one thing.
- What?
Tell me.
- No, I couldn't.
- What is it?
I never told Gloria how I feel about her.
What is it?
Please tell me!
I never had the guts to tell Gloria how I feel about her.
How I've always felt about her.
Fine.
Don't tell me!
Is it a woman?
You didn't tell me it's a woman.
What are you afraid of?
You're a dead man anyway.
Yeah.
Yeah.
You're right.
You've got to march right up to this woman.
Look her right in the eye.
Lean forward.
Just a little, or almost all the way.
Then you let her lean forward a little until you're just lips' distance away from each other.
Then you tell her how much you hate her.
Actually, it's more like love her.
Oh, you sly dog!
Woof, woof!
You're a real player.
Now listen to me.
You got to rise up.
You hearing me?
- He didn't hear you.
- I can't hear you!
- You got to rise up!
- Rising up!
- Get out of the hole!
- I'm rising out of the ground!
- He's rising, Maurice.
- I'm rising, Maurice!
- Rising!
- You go right up to this woman!
Do you feel it?
- Go up to her face!
- Tell the truth!
- I'm going to tell her!
- Then you say, "Baby, I dig you!"
Yeah!
I'm going to do it!
I'm going to do it!
I love that happy little head.
She love
Moto Moto
She love
Moto Moto
She loves me She loves my eyes
She loves me She loves my thighs
She loves my roundness
She love that I'm chunky She love that I'm plumpy
She love my heftiness She love my zestiness
She love me restlessly She love me forever
She love me 'cause she love me
Moto Moto before things get too serious, well,
I was wondering, if I were to, for example, stay here I'd like to ask you...
Let your candied lips be the messengers to my... ear canal.
I have so many questions.
I promise the answer will always be yes.
Unless no is required.
So what is it about me that you find so interesting?
You're the most plumpenest girl I've ever met.
OK.
Other than that.
Let's see.
Yeah, well, you know... you chunky.
Right.
My gosh, girl, you huge.
You said that.
Yeah, that's right.
We don't have to talk no more.
Gloria!
Gloria.
Melman.
Melman, I want you to meet Moto Moto.
Moto Moto.
Yeah, nice to meet you.
- I guess I...
- It's OK, Melman.
Apology accepted.
Oh.
Yeah, right, that.
That's why I...
Good.
OK.
Well, that's it, then.
Good.
We're kind of busy here, man.
No.
No, that's not it.
Listen, Mototo, you better treat this lady like a queen.
Because you, my friend, you found yourself the perfect woman.
If I was ever so lucky to find the perfect woman,
I'd give her flowers every day.
And notjust any flowers.
OK?
Her favorites are orchids.
White.
And breakfast in bed.
Six loaves of wheat toast, butter on both sides.
No crust, the way she likes it.
I'd be her shoulder to cry on and her best friend.
I'd spend every day thinking of how to make her laugh.
She has the most amazing laugh.
That's what I would do if I were you.
But I'm not, so you do it.
OK.
What?
That was beautiful.
Anyways, where were we?
I'm "huge"?
Surprised to see me, Makunga?
Well, I'm here to set things straight, like a real lion!
Is this real enough for you?
How about this?
This is for setting me up!
This is for stealing my dad's job!
This is for humiliating my family!
And making me look like a fool!
Had enough?
Sure, fly away!
Ooward.
The water.
It's gone.
It's never gone dry before.
- We'll need a lot more dying holes.
- How could this happen?
Out of my way!
What is going on here?
!
The watering hole is dry!
There's barely water for one of us!
- Good observation, Shirley.
- I'm Bobby.
Makunga, what do we do?
Quiet!
Listen up!
I'm afraid there is only one solution to this horrible crisis:
We'll all have to fight for it.
- We can't fight for it.
- That's crazy.
That's not fair.
You'd win!
Exactly, Shirley.
I'm Bob...
Sorry, folks, but life isn't fair.
I'm in charge now, thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion.
Please, Makunga, this is the only water on the reserve.
If you're thirsty, you'll have to look for water off the reserve.
- Off the reserve?
- It's too dangerous!
Hunters would shoot us!
No one leaves the reserve and survives!
I left the reserve!
And survived.
I can do something about this.
Looks like a clogged pipe, like we get in New York.
I'll travel upriver...
- Upriver?
- Off the reserve?
You?
Yeah.
I'll unclog the pipe and bring back your water.
Great!
I'd help you pack, but by the looks of that hat, I see you're all set!
Fine.
Go ahead, laugh.
Laugh your mane off.
I'll prove you wrong.
Maybe you should try a little rain dance.
Zuba would know what to do.
- Where's Zuba?
- You don't care about us.
Zuba should be in charge, not you.
All right, fine!
As an added measure, I will consult with Zuba!
Marty?
Hey!
Marty!
Marty?
Marty.
Where'd you get the fruity hat?
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
Hi.
Is Marty in there?
Anyone seen Marty?
Which one of us is Marty?
All right.
Well, if you see him, tell him his friend Alex came to say goodbye.
Goodbye?
Don't go.
Where are you going?
- Oan we come?
- No.
I have to do this alone.
You can't leave the reserve!
What are you doing?
- They'll get your hat.
- Hunters are everywhere!
Oould you leave the hat?
Marty!
I know you're in there.
Before I go, I got something I want to say.
You've been a great friend.
You've helped me so often to see the bright side of my problems that I never think of you having any.
I wasn't there for you when you needed me.
Just like back at the zoo.
What kind of friend does that make me?
A pretty lousy friend, I guess.
I just want you to know that I...
You're one in a million.
This is touching.
It is touching.
So could you turn around so I can tell you to your face?
That's right.
Gotcha!
I see you in there!
Yeah, you.
You, right there.
Twelfth row, two hundred and third from the left.
That's you, Marty.
I know it's you.
Know what makes you special?
These guys are white with black stripes.
You're black with white stripes.
You're a dreamer, Marty.
Always have been.
You have great taste in music and horrible taste in friends.
Well, not Melman and Gloria, but me.
OK, I'm in.
Marty, you can't come with me.
You don't have a choice.
- People are out there!
- You're crazy!
Oome back!
The people will get you!
Don't lose the hat!
Bye, hat!
Any water?
No, just more diamonds and gold.
Don't give up hope.
Listen up!
I will help you!
There's only one way to get your precious water.
I, your beloved King Julien must simply make a small sacrifice to my good friends, the water gods, in the volcano!
What does that do?
What does that do?
Excellent question.
My sacrifice goes in the volcano.
The friendly gods eat up my sacrifice.
"Thank you for the sacrifice. "
"Here, have another. " "No, I've had enough. "
"I'll be insulted unless you have another. "
"I don't want another sacrifice!"
"Look at you!
You're skinny!" "No!
I've had enough!"
The gods eat the sacrifice.
They are grateful.
They give me some water, and then I give it to you.
What?
Does it work?
No!
I mean, yes.
Well, Maurice?
Ah, it's fifty-fifty.
We'll do it!
Excellent!
Now all I need is someone who would like to go into the volcano and get eaten by gods.
Any hands!
Hands, anybody!
I need someone, perhaps who has never found love, who could look death straight in the eyeball.
A real, genuine hero.
- I'll do it.
- Melman?
Hurry up!
Before we all come to our senses!
Melman, what is wrong with you?
I'm dying anyway.
If there's a chance it'll get you water, it's worth it.
Are you nuts?
I want you to know, back at the zoo, it was never the doctors or prescriptions that kept me going.
It was always you.
Seeing you every day.
That's what kept me going.
Melman!
Wait!
Melman!
Melman!
Melman!
You going to mope like this all day?
Don't "hmph" me.
Listen, Zuba.
A miracle happened.
Our son came back to us.
How come that is not good enough for you?
What are you saying, woman?
We lost him once, Zuba.
Let's not lose him again.
Zuba!
- Zuba!
- Get out of here!
What do you want?
It's awful.
The watering hole is dried up.
Dried up?
That's impossible!
There's nothing left!
You're alpha lion, Makunga.
What are you gonna do about it?
Your son, Alakay, he said he could fix it.
He's gone upriver.
- Off the reserve?
!
- No!
I tried to stop him.
I told him it was suicide.
He was determined to prove himself to you.
You stay here, in case he comes back!
Hurry, Zuba!
I'm so parched.
Is this place starting to freak you out?
We'll slip in, find the problem.
Hunters will never know we were here.
Why are we doing this?
Maybe my dad will think I'm...
I want to show him I'm a real lion.
As opposed to a chocolate lion.
I know this may sound hard to believe, but apparently, lions don't dance.
What?
!
As far as my dad is concerned.
As far as people are concerned, you're a hit.
In New York.
This is Africa...
much tougher crowd.
Marty, this is it!
This is the clog!
Oome on.
Well, there's the water.
Stay down.
Look at that.
Knit one, purl two.
It's her.
- Is this right?
- Very good.
Nana, slow down.
You're a little tangled, aren't you?
No, don't pull.
I'll do it.
We need dynamite.
Got any?
Oh, snap!
I just used my last stick this morning!
- Savages!
- Evasive maneuvers!
- Serpentine, serpentine!
- Squiggly squid maneuver!
Zag, zig-zag, zig ziggy zag!
No, no!
Squiggly squid!
Etch A Sketch!
That's too complex!
Octopus, octopus!
- Run, Marty!
- I can't leave you here!
Go get help!
Squiggly squid maneuver!
Go!
Go!
Squiggly squid!
Etch A Sketch!
Etch A Sketch!
Save us We love you
OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- Save us
- Melman
- We love you
- Melman
Save us
OK, here we go.
OK, OK.
- Melman
- We love you
- Melman
- Save us
Here we go!
Here we go!
- What's all the hoopla about?
- Joe?
Joe the Witch Doctor?
We thought you were dead!
So did I. Then I realized I'm covered in brown spots.
So Melman's not dying!
- Melman's not dying!
- Oh, no!
Melman!
Move!
Don't do this!
Julien, stop this!
This is crazy!
Oh, suddenly throwing a giraffe into a volcano to make water is crazy!
Yes!
- Please, Melman!
Stop!
- Gloria?
- You can't do this!
- Why not?
Because...
You can't do this, Melman.
First, that hurts.
Second, I've only got 18 hours to live, anyway.
Melman, I gotta know did you mean those things you said about me?
Of course I did.
- That's crazy.
- It is?
It's crazy to think I had to go halfway around the world to find out the perfect guy for me lived right next door.
Then it's you and me, neighbor.
You and me for the next 18 hours.
I'll take whatever you got.
- Maurice, what happened?
- I believe the fat lady has sung.
- What's going on here?
- Marty!
Alex is in big trouble!
We got to get upriver fast!
- What about the plane?
- Perfect!
Oome on!
The plane won't be fixed until the suits meet our demands.
Now, maternity leave.
Maternity leave?
You're all males.
We need that plane for a rescue mission.
There's nothing I can do until we bust up this union.
I'll bust up all of you if you don't get this plane going.
Oan't you see these commies have my hands tied?
No maternity leave.
Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want these blowing around on the savanna.
All right.
You get your maternity leave.
Finally.
Where we headed?
What's going on?
Where are we going?
Oh, no!
Please!
Don't put me there!
No!
This is wrong.
You see?
You are survivors.
Now, how about a nice lion casserole?
You can't eat a lion.
Don't worry, it tastes like chicken.
No, no, no.
Don't listen to her.
She's out of her mind, people!
I'm from New York Oity!
It's me, Alex the lion!
From Oentral Park!
Dad!
What were you thinking, son?
You got no business being out here!
Stay behind me.
They're New Yorkers.
They're just rude and frightened people.
Stay back!
You'd let your dinner get away?
- What are you doing?
- The only thing I know how to do.
What the heck?
Hey, I know those moves.
Alex?
- It's Alex the lion!
- From Oentral Park!
It is Alex!
Only one lion can move like that!
He's beautiful.
I can't believe it.
How does he do that?
What are you doing?
I'm dancing with my son!
I think.
Don't think, Dad.
Feel!
Butterfly!
I'm feeling it!
I'm feeling it!
Roar!
That was beautiful.
Now let's eat!
Dad, look out!
What the...
Alex!
Get in!
She's got a gun!
Get out while we can!
- What?
- She's got a gun!
Get out while we can!
Pass it on!
He said let's have some fun and take out the dam.
Basset hound.
Skipper!
Alex wants to take out the dam.
All right!
But it's his funeral.
- Hard to port!
- Aye-aye, Skippy!
Bring it on!
Bring it on!
Oome back!
That's my dinner!
Kowalski, full throttle.
Music!
- I like this song.
- It never gets old.
It does have a catchy hook.
Oome about!
Bring her in low!
Hold onto your skirts!
It's dam-busting time!
Hold on tight, baby!
Here we go!
Tell them no!
Pull up!
They'll kill us!
There's got to be another way!
Pass it on!
They say no pull up.
Kill us.
There's no other way.
Basset hound.
Are you sure?
Men, there is no sacrifice greater than someone else's.
No!
Medic!
Ramming speed!
Bring it on!
Bad kitties.
I don't know why the sacrifice didn't work.
The science seemed so solid.
I'd jump right in that volcano if I wasn't so good at whistling.
It's you!
I found you!
Mort?
Bad fishy!
I wonder if the gods like seafood.
Let's find out.
Look, Maurice.
- That was quick.
- I did it!
I did it!
I did it!
OK, you did it!
Oh, yes!
Look!
- It's Alakay!
- It's Zuba!
You did it!
Alakay, Zuba, you did it!
Zuba!
Alakay!
You're back!
I'm so glad you're safe!
Out of my way.
Well, well, well.
You know, Zuba, if I remember correctly, you quit the pride.
And you were kicked out.
So don't think that this changes anything.
You're right.
In fact, we humbly present you with this token of appreciation.
A man bag.
Very popular where I'm from.
- Don't know what to say.
- Still be tough and carry your stuff.
Does the strap adjust?
This will go very nicely for me when I go out hiking.
But you're still banished.
We figured you'd say that.
My handbag!
You bad kitty!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
You deserve this, son.
Welcome to the pride.
Thanks, Dad.
But this belongs to you.
No, son.
To us!
My son!
The King of New York!
That's my baby!
Love transcends all differences.
We are gathered here today to celebrate such a love.
Do you take each other, for better or for worse?
For better, please.
What a beautiful, weird couple!
That's not going to last.
Oan I kiss the bride?
No!
Music!
- Struts.
- Oheck.
- Flaps!
- Oheck.
- Diamonds and gold.
- Oheck.
- Bye-bye!
- We'll miss you!
See you later!
We'll be back after the honeymoon in Monte Oarlo, or whenever the gold runs out.
Oome back soon!
Mom, let them take their time.
New York isn't going anywhere, right, guys?
You're right about that!
As long as I'm with her and you two, I don't care where we are.
She has the most amazing laugh.
Love has no boundaries!
Looks like you're stuck with us for a while.
Dad?
What's wrong?
I just thought we could hang out a bit and...
- You got me!
- I got you, son!
You got me with my thing.
You brought it back around on me.
I got you, son!
The old man's not too bad, eh, Marty?
- Marty?
Who's Marty?
- Oome on.
- I don't know no Marty.
- You can't fool me.
Ain't no Marty here.
Marty!
I can look into your eyes, and I know it's you.
See, I've been traveling Been traveling forever
But now that I found a home feels like I'm in heaven
See, I've been traveling Been traveling forever
But now that I'm home
Hey!
Shake the hot things!
Shake the hot things!
Shake 'em!
Shake 'em!
Shake 'em!
Well done, boys.
Looks like ice-cold sushi for breakfast.
No, no, son.
Over here.
See the lion?
Look at the lion and get the lion.
Now, son, if you're gonna grow up and be like your daddy someday, you gotta learn how to fight.
Da-da.
Now, Alakay, let me show you something, OK?
You see this mark?
You and me are the same.
When you're bigger, you are gonna be alpha lion just like your daddy.
Now let me see you fight.
Ready?
No, Alakay.
No dancing!
You just amuse yourself, don't you?
You're a strange kid.
You're a strange one.
I'm...
Now, come on, let's try it again.
No, Alakay.
Stop, stop that, stop that right now.
Doggone it!
It's so disappointing when they don't grow up the way you want it to.
Makunga.
You're not challenging me again, are you?
Look on the bright side Zuba.
After I defeat you and take over as alpha lion, you'll have so much more time to spend with your pathetic excuse of a son.
Before I kick your butt, let me ask you,
Why do you wanna become the alpha lion?
I'm better looking, I have better hair, I'm deceivingly smart and I want everyone else to do what I say.
We fight on three.
One...
Pay attention, Alakay.
Daddy will show you how it's done.
Two, three!
- Who's the alpha lion?
- You are.
Don't you forget it.
And that, Alakay, is how you attack...
Alakay?
That's it.
Here, kitty, kitty.
This one's a beauty.
He'll be worth a few bucks.
It just gets easier and easier.
Daddy!
Alakay!
Alakay!
Alakay!
Da-da!
No!
No!
No!
Alakay!
- Daddy!
- Alakay!
Daddy's got you!
Hold on!
Da-da!
Alakay!
Daddy!

I don't like the looks of this guy.
- Well, I think he is kind of cute.
- I think he is kind of show off.
You think he's cute?
Roar!
The King of New York City Alex the Lion!
I still think he's kind of a showoff.
You got to give it to him, the guy's an animal.
Maybe he should take a break.
You know, we could all use a vacation.
Come on.
Where on earth would we go on vacation.?
I don't know about you, but I wanna go to Connecticut!
On the loose, several animals, including the world famous Alex the Lion,
The king of New York, escaped from the Central Park Zoo tonight.
The escapees were finally cornered in Grand Central Station.
He was a very bad kitty.
Animal rights activists, who convinced zoo officials to have the animals sent to Africa, were stunned to learn that the shipping freighter carrying the animals was reported missing today.
Tonight, hundreds of New Yorkers have gathered at the zoo to mourn the loss of their beloved zoo animals.
The question on everyone's mind, where are they now?
# I like to move it, move it #
# He likes to move it, move it #
# She likes to move it, move it #
- # We like to
- Move it!
#
Come on!
Y'all know this one!
It never gets stale!
- # We like to
- Move it!
#
We'll miss you little fuzz buckets!
You've been a great crowd!
Glad we can introduce you to the toilet.
If you ever come look us up in Central Manhattan, feel free to call first.
Seriously though, call.
OK?
Settle down, settle down everybody.
Ssh...
Be quite.
- You can't leave without this!
- Hey.
Surprise freaks!
Shake it!
Shake it.
Look, I'm a lady!
I'm a lady, everyone!
I'm a lady!
Not really!
It's me, King Julien!
Which of you is attracted to me?
Hands up!
Hey, freaks!
You will be very glad to hear that I am coming with you.
Oh, no, thank you.
Yes, thank you.
It's my plane!
Until I return with the spoils from the new country Stevie will be in charge!
I don't think they like that idea so much Julien.
What are you saying, Stevie?
Oh, oh, no!
Could we...?
No, you didn't say that!
How is that even possible?
Naughty little thing!
Stevie says...
Let them eat cake!
King Julien, wait for me!
I'm all packed!
I have a whole itinerary planned!
Oh, no!
It's Mort!
He's so annoying!
Don't let him on.
Stop that thing!
He's carrying scissors and hand cream!
Everybody in!
Quickly, get in, get in!
Get in quick!
- Struts.
- Check.
- Flaps.
- Check.
- Engine.
Coffee maker.
- Check.
You guys!
Oopsie-daisy!
That has to be the second biggest slingshot I've ever seen.
But it'll have to do.
Attention.
This is your captain speaking.
In the event of a water emergency, place the vest over your head then kiss your life good-bye.
New York City, here we come baby!
Pray to your personal God this hunk of junk flies.
Personal God, hunk...?
What?
We are go, sir.
Open the door!
I'm outside!
In case of losing cabin pressure, place the mask over your face, to hide your terrified expressions from the other passengers.
Excuse me miss, But aren't these supposed to be attached to my seat?
- No, sir.
- OK, boys, launch!
Launch!
- Launch!
- Launch!
Gremlin!
Hey, Mort.
Hi!
That was weird.
- Hey, somebody is dreaming ha?
- I think I just saw Mort on wing of the plane.
You got Madagascar on the brain.
- Yeah.
- Sure.
- I know I'm gonna miss it.
It was incredible.
I think it'll seem much more fun the further way we get from.
Yeah, like when you beat me on the butt?
I'm gonna take that thing you're holding on to and I am going use it on stage.
It's all part of my little actor's salad bar of emotional tidbits.
Now, are the butts next to the croutons at the salad bar?
- You don't need to be sarcastic, Marty.
- Hey guys, you know, I was thinking.
When we get back, I might just sign up for the breeding program.
Breeding program?
I think we all reach a point on our lives when we wanna meet somebody,
- Yeah!
- Settle down, have a relationship.
- I can see that.
- What?
Like, like dating?
Yeah, dating.
Other, other... other...
Other... guys?
What do you mean, "other guys"?
Darn it!
I'm gonna, what is holding up that beverage service?
!
I'm gonna go check.
Oh, yeah ya, keep talking.
I'm gonna catch a few winks.
Did you see that?
It's so funny!
I like laughing!
It's such a nice experience!
To laugh!
Do you mind going back?
This is first class.
It's nothing personal. it's just that we are better than you.
Maurice, I'm open!
Hit me!
- He shoots, he scores!
- Is that Vivaldi?
- In-flight slave.
- Can I help you, Mr. Mankiewicz?
Bring my nuts on a silver platter.
We just wanted to check on the drinks we ordered.
Oh, sorry.
We are in a little backed up.
- I guess I'll go back...
- Hey, what happened to your body?
You're freaking me out!
Can you please go over there, please?
Thank you very much.
What happened to the separation of the classes?
Yeah, I'm sure this all democracy thing is just a fad.
We'll go out for pineapple, my little bobbly-headed boobily-boo.
Skipper, look.
Analysis.
It looks like a small incandescent bulb... designed to indicate something out of the ordinary.
Like a malfunction.
- I found it pretty and somewhat hypnotic.
- That too, sir.
Right!
Rico?
Manual!
Problemo solved.
- Sir, we may be out of fuel.
- What makes you think that?
We've lost engine one...
- ...and engine two is no longer on fire.
- Buckle up, boys.
Don't look, doll.
This might get hairy.
Attention!
This is your captain speaking.
I have good and bad news.
The good news is, we're landing immediately.
The bad news is, we're crash-landing.
When it comes to air travel, we know you have no choice what so ever..
But thanks again for choosing "Air Penguin."
Raise your arms, Maurice!
It's more fun when you raise your arms like this!
I can fly!
This could be it, Marty!
I just want you to know you are truly a one-in-a-million friend!
Thanks, buddy!
You're the best ever!
- I know, you won't mind when I tell you...
- Come on.
Tell me it, tell me, tell me what?
I broke your iPod!
- What?
- The buttons were so small!
It made me mad!
- The horror!
- I'm sorry!
- I'm gonna kill you!
butt-biter!
- It was an accident!
- An accident!
- Butt-biter!
I love you, Gloria!
I always have!
Like ah...
Like you love the beach.
Or a... good book...
Or the beach.
My goodness doll, you're shaking like a leaf.
Rico, you've had your fun.
Pull up.
Gear down.
Gently now.
You just wanna kiss the ground.
Just a little peck, a smooch, like you'd kiss your sister.
I said, kiss it!
Now just a little brake.
Just a touch.
a little whisper.
I believe that's checkmate.
Commence emergency landing procedure.
Flaps up!
Deploy!
Oh, we're here.
What in the world?
- What happened to the plane?
- Okay!
- What did y'all do to the plane?
- We've just crushed!
- I don't know!
I'm OK.
I'm alive.
See, I can't even sleep for a minute.
You know what, this is not JFK.
Kowalski, casualty report.
Only two... passengers unaccounted for, Skipper.
That's a number I can live with.
Good landing, boys.
Who says a penguin can't fly?
Hey, happy slappers!
Is there some reason to celebrate?
Look at the plane!
- We'll fix it.
- Fix it?
How you gonna fix this?
Grit, spit and a whole lot of duct tape.
We should be up and running in, say, six to nine months.
- Sixty-nine months?
!
- No, six to nine months.
Kowalski, I say we use this setback to our advantage.
Where do you get,... where do you pull that number out of, huh?
I want you to reconfigure the...
- ...design, so start reconfiguring!
- Great, that's a great...
How do you estimate that?
You!
Pretty boy!
Why don't you and your friends dig a tree, maybe find water.
Hold on, hold on a second.
Who made you king of... the plane wreck?
Excuse me?
Fine.
You can be in charge.
You fix the plane.
Who gives you the authority to put me in charge?
OK, then I'll remain in charge.
Yeah, that's right. you will remain in charge.
You and your little hippie friends stay out of our hair.
- Correcto-mundo.
Because I decided to.
- Good for you.
Yeah, well guess what this discussion isn't over.
Higher mammals!
You'll stay with us.
We could use your front cortexes and apposable thumbs.
Phil!
I should wash your hands out with soap.
How, in the...
Hello!
are they gonna fix this plane?
You know, grit and spit and spit.
A lot of spit and grit and stick-to-it-iveness.
That don't sound too promising.
You're right.
Right, We're stuck here.
Hey guys!
as long as we're together, we'll be OK.
Yeah, yeah but love ain't gonna get us home.
Behold!
The lion!
- Hey, it's people.
- OK.
There is much to see, moving on.
Wait, wait, wait!
People!
- They'll help us!
- Wait up!
- People!
Stop!
- Help us!
Hey wait, if you stop, I'll autograph those!
I know you!
- You.
- It's that bad kitty.
How do you like some of that?
!
Come in, Tokyo!
Right in the batteries.
You think an old lady can't take care of herself?
Next time, I won't go so easy on you!
Thank you, dear.
Moving on!
Are you out of your mind?
We need their help and you harass little old ladies?
!
Out of my mind?
Aha!
Who's out of my mind now?
- See if you can get an operator.
- No problem.
Out of my mind.
We're going home.
Message E-4.
The service user has roamed outside the coverage area.
Please try again later.
Oh my..
Wow...
Am I trippin'?
All those zebras...
like me.
- Wait a minute, Where are we?
- San Diego.
This time I'm 40 percent sure.
- I know this place.
- I think it's Africa.
Africa?
It's got to be.
Our ancestral crib.
- It's in our blood.
I can feel it!
- No, no. it's more than that.
It's like déjà vu, like I've been here before.
It's like Roots!
No, no. it's like déjà vu, like I've been here before.
How!
How!
Me Alex!
Me and me friends fly, fly in great metal bird.
Then plummet!
Smash ground!
Go boom!
Then here we emerge.
We offer only happiness and good greetings.
Is he dancing about a plane crash?
Yeah.
We just... yeah.
I thought...
Sorry.
You mean, you came from off the reserve.
Yeah, way off, from the Central Park Zoo actually.
Don't strain yourself.
What's going on here, what is all this have about?
They say they're from off the reserve.
That's impossible.
Only people come from off the reserve.
You look familiar.
Do I know you from...?
How could you possibly survive the hunters?
- Hunters, we didn't see any hunters.
- What are you looking at?
Me?
Nothing.
This watering hole doesn't need any more mouths to feed.
So just get out of back to wherever you came from.
OK.
Was there a maybe like a manager we can talk to?
- Oh, I see.
You're here to challenge me.
- What?
No!
No, no.
What else would start you look on to me?
Zuba!
Wait.
Don't call woman, don't you see I am trying...
Yeah, yeah, Zuba.
Hold on.
Alakay?
- Is that you?
- No, it's Alex. "X", like New York Knicks.
Zuba, look!
Oh, I have always had that, have had checked it out, it's really...
It's kind of a beauty spot, really.
A mark.
All right, this is a little weird.
Honey, he's come home.
What?
You've come home.
Son.
Dad.
Mom and Dad?
Mom and Dad!
Mom and Dad!
It's my mom and dad!
I got a mom and dad!
My baby's alive!
Dad!
My son!
My son is home!
Alakay!
Alakay has come home!
Alakay!
Yeah!
The prodigal son returns.
This is perfect!
I thought you hated Zuba.
No, I do.
I do.
I do.
I hate him.
Oh, I do.
And I'm going to use Alakay, yes.
I'm going to use him to get rid of Zuba once and for all!
Giddy-up, feathered horse!
Make way!
Move out of the way!
Stand aside!
New York!
It's a bit of a dump.
Are you sure we're not in New Jersey?
Hello, New Yorkers!
Your new king is here!
This calls for a celebration!
Maurice, I think they like me.
You've got to love a non-hostile takeover!
Chukka-chukka what?
Excuse me, excuse me.
I'm Marty.
I'm kind of new around here.
Hey, Marty!
You're a good-looking group!
You like to run?
Oh yeah.
Running is crack-a-lackin'.
That's right!
Crack-a-lackin'.
You guys speak my crack-a-lackin' language.
What?
You don't have doctors here?
Well, not any more.
Well, what if you catch a cold?
We go over to the dying holes and we die.
OK, you guys really need a doctor.
- Hey, we have an opening.
- Would you be interested?
Me?
A doctor?
It's raining men.
Hallelujah!
You all got it going on.
How come you don't have a man in your life?
You got worms?
Oh, I got rid of those.
Listen, girls.
Manhattan is short on two things, parking and hippos.
Hey, everybody!
I just found out that my son is a doggone king!
The King of New York!
Show me some of your moves, son.
Don't be bashful.
All right.
Ooh, this one always knocks 'em dead.
Roar!
Look out.
The King is mad.
The King is mad!
Now, let's all welcome him back into the pride with open arms!
Welcome to the herd, Marty!
Me, in a herd?
I've always wanted to be part of a herd!
- It's one for all...
- And all for all, y'all!
How do I look?
Technically, a traditional witch doctor has a bone through his nose.
Don't worry... it has just a clip on it.
Voilà!
He's a witch doctor!
My mother would be so happy.
Look out!
I think Moto Moto likes you.
Here he comes.
# I like 'em big #
# I like 'em chunky #
# I like 'em big I like 'em plumpy #
# I like 'em round With something' somethin' #
# They like my sound They think I'm funky #
Goodness, girl... you huge.
Who's your friend?
Or is that your butt?
Girl, you are as quick as you all have to.
So you're Moto Moto?
The name's so nice, you say it twice.
I kind of like it, that so.
I'll see you around, girl.
It won't be hard, because you so... plumpy.
Oops!
I hate to be a party pooper, Zuba, but some of the lions were wondering when you are going to banish your son.
- What are you talking about, Makunga?
- It's nothing, really.
They're griping about who Alakay never went through the rite of passage, blah, blah, blah, so technically speaking, he can't be a member of the pride.
It's nonsense.
I had forgotten about the rite of passage.
What is it?
What's this rite of passage?
It's a traditional coming-of-age ceremony, where young lions earn their manes by demonstrating their skills.
- Sort of a show skill, talent show, tab dale?
- Yeah.
Strutting their stuff.
A Great performance!
I think that's up my alley guys.
If it's tradition, I wanna do it.
Strut my stuff.
Earn my mane.
I want to be Alaki.
- Alakay.
- Alakay!
Even better.
We will hold the rite of passage first thing in the morning!
That's wonderful!
Good luck, Alakay.
Where I'm from, we say, "Break a leg."
Oh, that's my boy.
# I'm a private dancer, A dancer for money #
# Any old music will do #
Beautiful, isn't it?
- Yeah.
- It's amazing.
Guys this is where we belong.
Operation Tourist Trap is a go.
- Oh, I like that one.
That's a good one.
- It works on many levels sir.
You guys are a bunch of suck-ups.
- That, too.
- Absolutely.
- Hide.
- Stations.
Stage one.
Go!
Oh, no!
What have I done?
Come on, take the bait.
- What happened?
- What is going on?
- Oh, look at the poor little guy.
Is it dead?
Stage two!
Go, go, go!
I will give him the kiss of life.
Rico!
Rico!
Reverse!
Gas!
Music!
No!
Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
Come back!
What is all this rock'n'roll racket?
!
Is she dead?
No!
You hoodlums!
Good heavens!
Are you OK?
Lady, I found your pocketbook.
Oh, my handbag.
Such a good boy.
Nana can't survive without it.
Wow, you are one tough cookie.
Brownies Troop 416, Yonkers.
OK, nobody panic!
The best thing we can do is stay together.
We'll wait for another tour jeep.
It may take hours, and it's getting dark...
- ...but
- Where are you going?
I'm not gonna stay out in the opening get attacked by more animals.
I'm too old to die.
I don't know about you guys, but I'm going with her.
Old lady, wait up!
Please!
We need to stay together.
Fine!
We'll go that way!
Does anyone want a hard candy?
- Easy now.
- Watch your step.
And this, right here...
OK, are you ready?
This is where you always slept.
Oh, man!
- Was this mine?
- Look at you.
Look at him, honey.
Oh my.
Oh, this thing.
Look, look!
- I remember this!
- He remembers.
A little harder than...
You never slept on the right end.
You always slept on the bottom end.
Is that...?
Is that my...?
Is that me?
You had the cutest little paws.
Little, little bitty ol' paws.
You did that the day we lost you.
Wow.
I was so young.
What happened to me?
It was all my fault.
- I turned my back a minute and...
- It was not your fault.
Your father did everything he could.
He tracked those hunters for weeks.
Far off the reserve.
Finally, I had to assume the hunters well...
We thought, we thought they killed you.
But my son fought those hunters off ha!
Don't mess with the King of New York!
- That's right!
- Keep your chin in.
Alright, alright boys.
Be careful.
Watch out before you break something.
You used to call this "foofie."
"Foofie"?
Foofie.
Oh, he doesn't want that thing.
This is my foofie!
Zuba, you better give him his foofie.
I mean, no, thank you, thank you.
It's perfect.
Well son, you get your rest.
You have a big day tomorrow.
You're gonna need all your strength.
I'm gonna bring the house down for you dad.
I hope so.
Otherwise, your father will have to banish you.
Oh Jeez, Mom, really?
I know you're gonna do us proud.
You know why?
You were born with it.
Good night, Alakay.
My boy.
My own boy.
My son's a king.
My son's a king.
Good night, Mom.
Good night, Alakay.
Foofie.
Look at foofie!
My foofie!
Foofie, foofie, foofie.
My foofie!
No sign of civilization.
Everybody appears very tired.
I think we're lost.
Hey Nana, do you even know where you're going?
No, but I'm going with a skip in my step and a smile on my face.
Sure, right, OK.
Yeah, all right.
- Uh, It's people.
Where do you come from?
- How could we get out of here?
- Can you help us?
We're lost.
- We're lost too.
It was awful.
A flash of black and white never gone.
They took the jeep!
Everything.
- That happened to our jeep too!
- What are we gonna do?
How will we all survive?
No food, no water, no shelter.
What are we gonna do?
!
You can let nature get the best of you, or you can get the best of nature.
Gather 'round, children.
We're New Yorkers, right?
Yeah.
- We survive the concrete jungle!
- That's right!
When we need food, we hunt for a decent hotdogs stand.
- Am I right?
- She's right.
When we need shelter, we build skyscrapers.
- Exactly!
- When we need water, we build a dam.
Come on, we're New Yorkers, for crying out loud!
If we can make it there, we can make it anywhere!
I'm coming, King Julien!
Bad fishy!
Bad fishy!
No, shark, no!
no!
Sit!
Why am I laughing?
Skipper, we have all the parts we need, but we're slightly behind schedule.
- How slightly?
- Uh, six to nine years.
- Sixty-nine years?
- No, six to nine years.
Private!
What happened to our thumbs?
Haven't seen them since yesterday sir.
Damn you, Darwin!
Nobody goes AWOL on my watch.
Private!
You're coming with me.
Rico!
You're coming with me!
I'm tracking down to bring them in for court martial.
That won't be necessary!
We've recruited a few extra thumbs for you, Skipper.
Well, I'll be a monkey's uncle.
Oh, I doubt that.
Enough lollygagging.
Now let's get to work.
We'll divide into three groups.
Group Alpha, you are charged in sheet metal fabrication.
Group Prosy, you'll handles assembly.
Group George Peppard, you'll handle gas services.
Any questions?
Good!
Let's get to work.
I'd like to kiss you, monkey man.
All right, but you're so Darn ugly.
Alright, so little cubs cats, just remember, great dance performance comes from the heart.
Just comes straight from your heart and you never go wrong.
Sure, mister.
Hey, Alakay, I just happened to walk by, I thought I'd wish you luck.
- You're not nervous, are you?
- Nah, it's my thing, you know.
It's kind of what I do.
In my opinion, the key to this whole thing is choosing the right competitor.
Oh, you mean, this is like a dance,... battle sort of thing?
- Like a dance-off?
- Uh... sure.
Great.
I love that.
Freestyle, put your moves out.
Who do you thing would be a good match for me?
You know, just to keep the things interesting.
Well, I wish I could help, but that's strictly against our ancient tradition and all although hold secret, but if it was me out there...
I'd choose Teetsi.
Teetsi.
OK.
Sounds interesting.
Makunga, right?
Thank you.
Anything for Zuba's boy.
Go get 'em, tiger.
Shake it out.
A five, six, seven, eight.
Let's go, let's do it, let's do this.
Let us begin the rite of passage ceremony.
- Come on, baby!
Make Mama proud!
- Woman, I'm trying to take...
Got it, Mom!
So who will be the first participant?
Me!
Oh!
Me, me, me!
Me!
Me!
Me!
- ...
Me, me!
Please, me?
- How about you?
The tall, handsome one.
Right there, yeah.
Choose your opponent.
Let me see.
I guess I'll pick Teetsi?
Teetsi?
Why did he pick Teetsi?
Oh, that's my boy, he got some gumption there.
Somebody wake him up, wake him up.
All right, so, Teetsi, come on.
Let's do this, huh?
Come on, Teetsi fly, Teetsi fly.
Come on let's see your stuff.
Bring it.
- Let's dance!
- OK.
But it's only fair to warn you that I am a protégé of Fupsy and Robbins!
Not "dance" dance!
Fight!
Oh, dance fight.
You got it.
- Is he dancing?
- What's he doing?
I know that boy is not dancing.
This is even better than I thought.
Alakay, turn around!
No, no, Pop, it's hop, shuffle, ball change, hip swish, turn around.
Oh, no.
Alakay!
Are you hurt?
- Oh yeah, I'm.
- Oh!
- Did I... did I win?
- Oh no son.
How could, I mean how could this happen?
You told us you were a king.
And a king does not get beat.
Well, I'm a king.
I'm a king in New York.
It's...
It's my stage name.
I'm like a, you know, It's for what I perform.
Perform?
Oh, no, this is horrible!
Alakay has failed the test!
Who would have ever imagined that today Zuba would have to banish his own son?
Zuba, no.
Zuba, yes.
Sadly, the alpha lion must cast out all failures.
Then, I'm no longer the alpha lion.
Dad, what are you doing?
Dad, no!
You can't do this.
Who could possibly take Zuba's place?
Anyone?
Someone?
No one?
You, sir!
I guess not.
Well, I... this is all very awkward, but I suppose I... could carry this tremendous burden.
Teetsi!
Get the hat.
As your new leader, I hereby banish Alakay!
He shall wear this Hat of Shame...
and leave the watering hole for a thousand years, or life!
Whichever comes last.
Come on.
Shoo, shoo!
Get out of here!
You should have told us, You should have told us that you weren't a real king!
You never told me I'd have to fight anybody!
What did you expect, Son?
!
I don't know!
Maybe a little fatherly advice, like... "Hey, son, it's a fight!"
You're a lion, aren't you?
- But I never fought another lion in my life!
- Yeah, I guess not.
You dance!
And other stuff!
The point is, your pal, Makunga, set me up back there!
- I mean, none of these would happen...
- If you were a real lion.
- Zuba!
- Yeah, I said it!
A real lion.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot.
Saw.
Suture.
Swab.
You're in my light, Stephen.
Ooo, say.
You've got a brown spot there on your shoulder.
Yes, that's very observant of you Stephen.
As you can see, I'm covered in brown spots.
OK!
That bone will be good as new in a few weeks.
So I don't have to pick out a dying hole?
No, Timo, you've got your whole life ahead of you.
- Really?
- Go out there and grab a bite of that horns.
- Thank you, Dr. Mankiewicz!
- Break a leg!
Sweet kid.
This spot looks like Witch Doctor's Disease.
Witch Doctor's Disease?
That's the most ridiculous disease I've ever heard of.
- Don't ask.
- Someone's been knotty.
Ok, this won't hurt a bit.
Joe, our last witch doctor, had a spot just like that.
- Ohum?
and?
- Monday, Joe.
Wednesday, no Joe.
Wednesday, no Joe?
I can breathe!
Thanks, doc!
So, this... this Witch Doctor's Disease is a real thing?
You'll find a cure.
Hey, you got at least forty eight hours.
But I've never heard of it.
What?
I mean...
I don't have any penicillin.
I'm gonna need a CAT scan just to get started!
You'll have a lion looking over.
They'd be happy to.
Ta-da!
- That guy has got talent.
- Stupendous and tremendous.
Hollah!
Bet you've never seen that one before!
Knocked 'em dead in New York!
- Hey, let's all give it a try.
- Yeah, let's do it.
Well, hey hey hey, I know you want to but it takes years of practice.
You get never gonna quite get a tight stream... until you build up your lip muscles to the point where you can... purse your lips like this.
You got it?
Ta-da!
How did you...?
You guys got it right out of the box!
- If you can do it...
- ...we can do it.
It's in our blood!
I always thought, I was a little bit unique.
We are unique!
Hey, we are like a force of nature.
- A million points of light!
- And dark stripes!
Exactly the same!
Exactly the same.
Looks impressive, Kowalski, but... will it fly?
Yes.
If we fold it here, here and here.
Nice.
Oh, man.
My dad thinks I'm a total loser.
I've ruined my parents' lives.
That is definitely not crack-a-lackin'.
It is lacking' in the cracking', my friend.
I've gotta fix this.
So there's...
Um...
There's something I gotta tell you.
Hey, guys.
Is this place great or what?
!
I'd go with "or what."
Oh well, I tell you what.
You're not gonna believe it, but I got a date with Moto Moto.
- Who's Moto Moto?
- Oh, he's so big and handsome and big!
- You know what "Moto Moto" means?
- Twins?
- It means, "Hot Hot." - "Hot Hot"?
OK, when did you start parley in African?
- It's in my blood.
- Well, don't worry, you can flirt around with Mr. Hot Pants after I'm gone.
What's the deal Melman?
Why am I the parade and you're the rain?
Why do you have to dry the parade under my rain?
Maybe I'll just parade myself in another part of town.
- Whoa, guys.
- Fine by me,...
By the way, the main streets mine.
Well, you can have your old stinking main streets.
And you can take your hottie tub flood and you Mr. hot, Moto Moto Jr. comes...
- What are you talking about?
- What are we talking about?
Come on Melman, why don't you just tell her?
You tell, what?
Tell her, what are you talking about?
- I don't know what you are talking about.
- So I guess, I'll go then.
- You know what, don't bother.
- Don't get up on my account.
- Melman!
Gloria!
- Hey,...
- I...
I thought you guys were friends.
- Come on guys, Marty is absolutely right.
- Marty?
- Marty?
Marty?
What the heck is going on?
You're not ooh..
He was no!
I thought he...
You're not him.
He is ooh...
You thought that guy was me?
No, no, no.
I mean yes, yes.
You do guys,...
You guys do kind of look a little a lot you look a lot alike.
Marty you look a lot alike, come on.
You laugh alike, you talk alike, he has the same sort of speech pattern...
I mean that is a little weird.
Really, you two guys are, come on Marty.
So... you're saying there's nothing unique about me.
- I'm just like any other zebra.
- No.
Of course you're different!
- How?
- How?
OK, ok, I can't tell you apart.
Maybe you could wear a bell or something.
I don't know.
- A bell?
!
- OK. not a bell, no, bell is a...
- ...bad idea..
- No, no, no.
How about a T-shirt that says, "I'm with stupid"?
- I'm not stupid!
- Not you, stupid!
Him, stupid!
You know what?
While you have been off doing prancing pony with the new pussy.
I have been having pretty much the worst day of my life, OK?
It's always about you, isn't it?
My problems are just a little bit bigger than yours Marty.
All right, I couldn't tell you apart.
So what?
!
Yeah, fine.
Run away, Marty!
Run away!
That's what you do best!
Just like back in New York!
I'm right here.
But you can't tell that, right?
Your one in a million friend hopes you enjoy your bigger-than-anyone-else's problems alone
Good, leave!
I don't need you to help me solve my problems!
You know what?
You diame dust I can't tell which one's Marty!
Oh, which one is Marty?
Wait a minute, wait a minute, oh yeah!
I don't care.
Nice hat, you showoff!
Marty don't go.
Giddy-up, giddy-up!
Look, Maurice!
Here is the perfect spot for my summer palace!
so please fill in all these holes and relocate the riff-raff..
- Oh, who'd leave a perfectly good head lying around.
- What a waste.
Tell me about it.
I'm in my prime here.
I'm terminal, you know?
Probably only have another two days left to live.
That's a bummer, man.
Oh, if I King Julien, that's my name only had two days left to live,
I would do all the things I've ever dreamed of doing.
Like what?
I'd love to become a professional whistler.
I'm pretty amazing at it now, but I wanna get luck even better,
I'd make my living out of it.
You know what else I'd do?
I would invade a neighboring country and impose my own ideology, even if they didn't want it!
It's easy for you to say, you are a king.
Yes.
And you are only just a sad little head.
But there must be something you want to do before you die.
- Well, there is this one thing.
- What is it?
Tell me.
- Well.
No, I couldn't.
I mean.
- What is it?
You know, I just never really have the guts to tell Gloria,...
- ...how I think about her.
- What is it?
Please tell me!
I don't really have the guts to tell Gloria, how I feel about her.
I have always felt about her.
Fine, don't tell me!
Oh,...
Is it a woman?
You didn't tell me we are talking about a woman.
What are you afraid of?
You're a dead man anyway, come on.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah, you are right.
Well, you gotta march right up to this woman, right?
You look her right in the eye, you lean forward, right?
Just a little, or almost all the way.
Then you let her, like, lean forward, just a little bit until you're just lips' distance away from each other.
And then you just tell her, how much you hate her.
- Actually, it's more like love her.
- Oh, you sly dog!
Woof, woof!
You're a real player, you know that?
Now listen to me.
You gotta rise up.
You hearing me?
- He didn't hear you.
- I can't hear you!
- Yeah!
- Good.
You gotto rise up.
- Rising up!
- Yeah!
- Get out of the hole!
- I'm rising up of the ground!
- He's rising, Maurice.
- I'm rising, Maurice!
- Rising!
- You gotto go right up to this woman.
Yeah!
- Do you feel it?
- Yeah!
- You gotto go right up to her face!
- Tell the truth!
- I'm going to tell her!
- And then you gotta say:
Baby, I dig you.Yeah.
Yeah!
I'm going to do it!
I'm going to do it!
I love that happy little head.
# She love #
# Moto Moto #

# Moto Moto #
# She loves me She loves my eyes #

Moto Moto before things get too serious, well,
I was wondering, if I were to, for example, stay here I'd like to ask you...
Let your candy lips be the messages to my... ear canal.
Well I don't know, I have so many questions.
Well I promise, the answer will always be yes...
Unless no is required.
OK, so what is it about me that you find so interesting?
Oh, you're the most plumpenest girl I've ever met.
OK.
Other than that.
Let's see.
You, well, you know... you're chunky.
Right.
My gosh, girl, you're huge.
You said that.
Oh, yes right.
We don't have to talk no more.
Gloria!
Gloria.
Melman.
Melman, I...
I want you to meet Moto Moto.
Ah, Moto Moto.
Yeah, nice to, nice to meet you.
- Well, I guess I...
- It's OK, Melman.
Apology accepted.
Oh, yeah, right, yes.
That, yes, that's why I...
Good.
- Oh, OK.
That's well, that's it then.
- You good, we're kind of a busy here man.
No.
No, that's not it.
Listen, Mototo, you better treat this lady like a queen.
Because you, my friend, you found yourself the perfect woman.
If I was ever so lucky to find the perfect woman,
I'd give her flowers every day.
And not just any flowers.
OK?
Her favorites are orchids.
White.
And breakfast in bed.
Six loaves of wheat toast with butter on both sides.
No crust, the way she likes it.
I'd be her shoulder to cry on and her best friend.
I'd spend every day trying to think of how to make her laugh.
She has the most... most amazing laugh.
That, well, I mean.
That's what I would do, if I were you.
But I'm not, so you do it.
OK. ok.
What?
That was beautiful.
Anyways, where were we?
I'm "huge"?
Surprised to see me, Makunga?
Well, I'm here to set things straight, like a real lion!
Is this real enough for you?
How about this?
This is for setting me up!
This is for stealing my dad's job!
This is for humiliating my family!
And making me look like a fool!
Had enough?
Sure, fly away!
Coward.
- The water.
It's gone.
- Oh no.
The watering hole has never gone dry before.
- We're gonna need a lot more dying holes.
- How could this happen?
Out of my way!
What is going on here?
!
The watering hole is dried up!
There's barely water for one of us!
- Yes, good observation, Shirley.
- I'm Bobby.
Makunga, what do we do?
Quiet!
Listen up!
I'm afraid there is only one solution to this horrible crisis.
We'll all have to fight for it.
- Fight for it?
- Fight for it?
- That's crazy.
That's not fair.
You'd win!
Exactly, Shirley.
I'm Bob...
Sorry, folks, but life isn't fair.
I'm in charge now, thanks to Alakay, the dancing lion.
Please, Makunga, this is the only water on the reserve.
If you're thirsty, you'll have to look for water off the reserve.
- Off the reserve?
- It's too dangerous!
- Hunters would shoot us!
- No one leaves the reserve and survives!
I left the reserve!
And survived.
I can do something about this.
Looks like a clogged pipe, like we get in New York all the time.
I'll travel up river...
- Up river?
- Off the reserve?
You?
Yeah.
I'll unclog the pipe and bring back your water.
Great!
I'd help you pack, but by the looks of that hat, I see you're all set!
Yeah fine.
Go ahead, laugh.
Laugh your mane off.
I'm gonna prove you're wrong..
Maybe you should try a little rain dance.
Zuba would know what to do.
- Where's Zuba?
- You don't care about us.
Zuba should be in charge, not you.
All right, fine!
As an added measure, I will consult with Zuba!
Marty?
Hey!
Marty!
Marty?
Marty.
Where'd you get the such fruity hat?
Excuse me!
Excuse me!
Hi.
Is...is Marty in there?
Anyone seen Marty?
Which one of us is Marty?
All right.
Well, if you see him, tell him his friend Alex came to say goodbye.
- Goodbye?
Don't go.
Where are you going?
- Can we come?
No. no.
This is something I have to do alone.
You can't leave the reserve!
What are you doing?
- They'll get your hat.
- Hunters are everywhere!
Could you leave the hat?
Marty!
I know you're in there.
Before I go, I got something I wanna say.
You've been a great friend.
You've helped me so often to see the bright side of my problems that I never think of you having any.
I wasn't there for you when you needed me.
Just like back at the zoo.
What kind of friend does that make me?
A pretty lousy friend, I guess.
Well I just want you to know that I...
You're one in a million.
This is touching.
It is touching.
So could you please turn around so I can tell you that to your face?
That's right.
Got you.!
I see you in there.
Yeah yeah you.
That's right you, right there.
Twelfth row, two hundred and third from the left.
That's you, Marty.
I know it's you.
You know what makes you special?
These guys are white with black stripes.
You're black with white stripes.
You're a dreamer, Marty.
Always have been.
You have great taste in music and horrible taste in friends.
Well, not Melman and Gloria, but me.
OK, I'm in.
No Marty, you can't come with me.
I don't believe you have a choice.
- People are out there!
- You're crazy!
Come back!
The people will get you!
Don't lose the hat!
Bye, hat!
Any water?
No, just more diamonds and gold.
OK.
Don't give up hope.
Listen up!
I will help you!
There's only one way to get your precious water.
I, your beloved King Julien must simply make a small sacrifice to my good friends, the water gods, in the volcano!
What does that do?
What does that do?
Excellent question.
My sacrifice goes in the volcano.
Then the friendly gods eat up my sacrifice.
"Very nice.
Thank you for the sacrifice."
"Please have another sacrifice" "No, I've had enough for the day."
"Listen, I'm gonna be insulted unless you have another."
"I don't want another sacrifice, OK?"
"Look at you!
You look skinny!" "No, I think I've had enough, is that clear!"
The gods eat the sacrifice, they are grateful,
They give me some of their water, and then I give it to you.
What?
Does it work?
No!
I mean, yes.
Well, Maurice?
Ah, it's fifty-fifty.
- Yeah!
- We'll do it!
Excellent!
Now... all I need is someone who would like to go into the volcano and get eaten by gods.
Any hands!
Hands, anybody!
OK.
I need someone, perhaps who has never fall in love, who could look death straight in the eyeball.
A real, genuine hero.
- I'll do it.
- Melman?
Hurry up!
Before we all come to our senses!
Melman, what is wrong with you?
I'm dying anyways.
If there's a chance it'll get you water, it'll be worth it.
Are you nuts?
Gloria, I just want you to know, back at the zoo, it was never the doctors or prescriptions that kept me going.
It was always you.
Seeing you every day.
That's what kept me going.
Melman!
Wait!
Melman!
Melman!
Melman!
You gonna mope like this all day?
Don't "hmph" me.
Listen, Zuba.
A miracle happened.
Our son came back to us.
How come that is not good enough for you?
What are you saying, woman?
We lost him once, Zuba.
Let's not lose him again.
Zuba!
- Zuba!
- Get out of here!
What do you want Makunga?
It's awful.
The watering hole is dried up.
Dried up?
That's impossible!
There's nothing left!
Well, you are the alpha lion Makunga.
What are you gonna do about it?
Your son, Alakay, he said he could fix it.
He's gone up river.
- Off the reserve?
!
- No!
I tried to stop him.
I told him it was suicide.
but he was determined to prove himself to you.
You stay here, in case he comes back!
Hurry, Zuba!
I'm so parched.
Is this place starting to freak you out?
We'll slip in, find the problem.
Hunters will never know we were here.
Why are "we", doing this?
Look, Marty maybe my dad'll think that I'm...
I just wanna show him, I'm a real lion.
As opposed to a chocolate lion.
I know this may sound hard to believe, but apparently, lions don't dance.
What?
!
As far as my dad is concerned.
As far as people are concerned, you're a huge hit.
That was New York.
This is Africa.
It's a much tougher crowd.
Marty, Marty, this is it!
This is the clog!
Come on.
Well, there's the water.
Marty, stay down.
Look at that.
Knit one, purl two.
It's her.
- Is this right?
- Oh, very good.
Nana, slow down.
You're a little tangled, aren't you?
No, don't pull.
I'll do it.
We need dynamite, do you have any dynamite?
Oh, snap!
I just used my last stick this morning!
- Savages!
- Evasive maneuvers!
- Serpentine, serpentine!
- Squiggly squid maneuver!
Zag, zig-zag, zig ziggy zag!
No, no!
Squiggly squid!
Etch A Sketch!
That's too complex!
Octopus, octopus!
- Run, Marty!
- I can't leave you here!
Go get help!
Squiggly squid maneuver!
Go!
Go!
Squiggly squid!
Etch A Sketch!
Etch A Sketch!
# Save us, We love you #
OK.
OK, OK, OK.
- # Save us
- Melman #
- # We love you
- Melman #
# Save us #
OK, here we go.
OK, OK.
- # Melman
- We love you #
- # Melman
- Save us #
Here we go!
Here we go!
- What's all the hoopla about?
- Joe?
Joe the Witch Doctor?
We thought you were dead!
So did I. Then I realized I'm covered in brown spots.
So Melman's not dying!
- Melman's not dying!
- Oh, no!
- Excuse me, excuse me.
Melman!
Move out!
Don't do this!
Julien, stop this!
This is crazy!
Oh, suddenly throwing a giraffe into a volcano to make water is crazy!
Yes!
- Please, Melman!
Stop!
- Gloria?
- You can't do this!
- Why not?
Because...
You can't do this, Melman.
First, that hurts.
Second of all, I've only got 18 hours to live, anyway.
Melman, I gotta know did you really mean those things you said about me?
Of course I did.
- That's crazy.
- It is?
It's crazy to think I had to go halfway around the world to find out the perfect guy for me lived right next door.
Then I guess it's you and me neighbor...
You and me for the next 18 hours.
I'll take whatever you got.
- Maurice, what just happened?
- I believe the fat lady has sung.
- Hey, what's going on here?
- Marty!
Hey, hey, listen up.
Alex is in big trouble.
We get to get up the river fast.
- What about the plane?
- Perfect!
Come on!
The plane won't be fixed until the suits meet our demands.
Now, about maternity leave.
Maternity leave?
You're all males.
Look, we need a plane for rescue mission.
Well, there is nothing I can do until we bust up this union.
I'm gonna get the busty not bully you if you don't get this plane going.
Can't you see these commies have my hands tied here?
No maternity leave.
Maybe a certain someone wouldn't want these blowing around on the savanna.
All right.
You get your maternity leave.
Finally.
Where we headed?
What's going on?
Where are we going?
Oh, no!
Please!
No!
You are not gonna burn me there.
No, no, no!
This is wrong,
You see?
You are survivors.
Now, how about a nice lion casserole?
You can't eat a lion.
Don't worry, it tastes like chicken.
No, no, no, no.
Don't listen to her.
She's out of her mind, people!
I'm from New York City!
It's me, Alex the lion!
From Central Park!
Dad!
What were you thinking, son?
You got no business being out here!
This's it, I want you to stay behind.
They're New Yorkers.
They're just rude and frightened people.
Stay back!
Are you gonna let them get away?
- What are you doing, son?
- The only thing I know how to do.
What the heck?
Hey, I know those moves.
Alex?
- It's Alex the lion!
- From Central Park!
It is Alex!
Only one lion can move like that!
This is beautiful.
I can't believe it.
How does he do that?
Dad, what are you doing?
I'm dancing with my son!
I think.
Don't think, Dad.
Feel!
Butterfly!
I'm feeling it!
I'm feeling it!
Roar!
That was beautiful.
Now let's eat!
Dad, look out!
What the...
Alex!
Get in!
She's got a gun!
Let's get out while we can!
- What?
- She's got a gun!
Let's get out while we can!
Pass it on!
He said let's have some fun and take out the dam.
Basset hound.
Skipper!
Alex wants to take out the dam.
- All right!
But it's his funeral.
- What?
- Hard Deploy!
- Aye-aye, Skippy!
Bring it on!
Bring it on!
Come back!
That's my dinner!
Kowalski, full throttle.
Music!
- I like this song.
- It never gets old.
It does have a catchy hook.
Come about!
Bring her in low!
Hold onto your skirts!
It's dam-busting time!
Hold on tight, baby!
Here we go!
Tell them no!
Pull up!
They'll kill us!
There's got to be another way!
Pass it on!
They say no pull up.
Kill us.
There's no other way.
Basset hound.
Are you sure?
Men, there is no sacrifice greater than someone else's.
No!
Medic!
Ramming speed!
Bring it on!
Bad kitties.
I don't know why the sacrifice didn't work.
The science seemed so solid.
I'd jump right in that volcano if I wasn't so good at whistling.
- It's you!
I found you!
- Mort?
Bad fishy!
I wonder if the gods like seafood.
Let's go find out.
Look, Maurice.
- That was quick.
- I did it!
I did it!
I did it!
OK, you did it!
Oh, yes!
Look!
- It's Alakay!
- It's Zuba!
You did it, Zuba!
Alakay, Zuba, you did it!
Zuba!
Alakay!
You're back!
I'm so glad you're safe!
Out of my way.
Well, well, well, well, well.
You know, Zuba, if I remember correctly, you quit the pride.
And you were kicked out.
So don't think for any instant that "this", changes anything.
You're right.
In fact, we humbly present you with this token of appreciation.
That is a man bag, very popular where I came from.
- I don't know what to say.
- You can still be tough and carry your stuff.
Does the strap adjust?
Yes.
I think this his will go very nicely for me when I go out hiking.
But I'm afraid you're still banished.
We figured you'd say that.
My handbag!
You bad kitty!
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
You deserve this, son.
Welcome to the pride.
Thanks, Dad.
But this belongs to you.
No, no, son.
To us!
My son!
The King of New York!
That's my baby!
Love transcends all differences.
We are gathered here today to celebrate such a love.
Do you take each other, for better or for worse?
For better, please.
What a beautiful, weird couple!
That's not going to last.
Can I kiss the bride, Skipper?
No!
Music!
- Struts.
- Checked.
- Flaps!
- Checked.
- Diamonds and gold.
- Checked.
- Bye-bye!
- We'll miss you!
See you later!
We'll be back after the honeymoon in Monte Carlo,
- or whenever the gold runs out.
- Take care yourself...
Come back soon!
Hey you know mom, let them take their time.
New York isn't going anywhere, right, guys?
- Yeah, you're right about that, hey!
- Well, as long as I'm with her and you two, I don't care where we are.
She has the most amazing laugh.
- Love has no boundaries!
- Well,...
Looks like you're stuck with us for a while.
Dad?
What's wrong?
I just thought we could hang out a bit and...
- You got me!
- I got you, son!
You got me with my...
You did my thing.
You got a background on me.
I love it.
I got you, son!
The old man's not too bad, eh, Marty?
- Marty?
Who's Marty?
- Come on.
- I don't know no Marty.
Don't call me Marty.
- You can't fool me.
I don't see no Marty.
Ain't no Marty here.
Marty!
I can look into your eyes, and I know it's you.
# See, I've been traveling Been traveling forever #

Hey!
Shakethehot things!
Shake the hot things!
Shake' em!
Shake'em!
Shake 'em!
Shake 'em!
Allah, in his wisdom and greatness, has given us each a gift.
A gift that we must share with others.
Even if they do not wish to accept it.
It is our obligation to share Islam with non-believers.
So that we may save them from themselves.
NCIS Season 5 Episode 11 Tribes (Version LOL V1.0)
My husband.
You were anxious to talk to him, weren't you?
That's a movie.
I'm starting to get over the idea...
Not just any movie.
That's "Double Identity".
Your power of observation is unearthly.
Now, leave me alone.
This is the best part.
I not gonna get between a chick and a flick.
How do you know it's the best part?
Because it is the third time I have seen it.
You don't even watch movies.
This is not a movie.
It's a classic film.
Yeah, I know that.
You don't know that.
Film studies?
Well...
I really appreciate that, Ziva.
Really, I do.
I am taking it because it is the best way to pick up American colloquialism, like "bug off."
You should watch "Fast Times at Ridgemont High".
I saw it last week.
Sean Penn is a genius.
Phoebe Cates is a babe.
Now, do you mind?
- I can get you a list...
- I have a list!
Bye.
Morning, Probie Pan.
Where'd you pick that up?
Neverland?
No, Pottery Den.
50% off.
Got six of them for ten dollars.
That's pretty big, don't you think?
Well, I don't like getting refills ten times a day.
Well, but I mean, that's a little...
A little what?
Seuss-ical?
Leave.
I'm enjoying my moment.
Am I the only normal one here?
No.
Morning, Boss.
Marine killed.
Let's go.
Shotgun.
Anacostia and 18th, not the battlefield he thought he'd die on.
Baghdad's safer than this neighborhood.
Hey.
What do we got?
Ring, watch, and wallet are missing.
Government issue.
Could be the murder weapon.
A Marine killed with his own gun?
Nearly 30% of all gun-related deaths are the results of the owner's own weapon.
Your first impressions, Mr. Palmer?
Well, there should be much more blood loss evident.
Based upon?
Based on the position of the body, even with the heart slightly elevated.
Precisely even with a gunshot that high in the thoracic cavity, one would expect more
- blood loss.
- Meaning?
Meaning I'm not going to say anything else until I've examined the body more closely.
The gurney, please, Mr. Palmer.
Right away, Doctor.
Good lad.
Good Marine.
Sunni.
- How do you know that?
- If he were a Shiite, he'd have a turba with him.
Like Hadji on "Johnny Quest".
No, I believe that's a turban, Tony.
A turba is a small stone tablet that the Shiites set their forehead on while praying.
The devout develop a callus.
Ziva.
Checking for local Sunni mosques.
McGee.
Checking all security cameras.
Got it.
There's a Sunni mosque two blocks east.
Show me.
She cannot come in here.
Women are not allowed.
I will wait outside.
Federal agents.
She's with me.
She is welcome here.
As you are.
I'm sure you understand traditions.
We do not wish to offend anyone.
I am Jewish.
I do understand tradition.
You... wish to ask me questions?
No.
Then, you wish to speak to every man who worships here under the age of 30.
No.
Then what?
We think this man may have attended your mosque.
And what has he done?
Nothing.
He is dead, killed two blocks from here.
Do you know him?
Stahf'Allah.
This is my son.
Your son have any enemies?
Yes.
Ignorance, intolerance, and hatred.
Any with a first name?
We would like your permission to look at Abdul's things.
I'll need to tell the family what has happened.
We will have someone drive you.
Thank you.
You wait here.
Please.
Come on.
Guy was with his son right before he died.
Suspect.
Victim.
Abdul Mohammed Bakr, age 23, Lance Corporal.
Served in First FAST Company.
Bronze Star and Purple Heart for service in Iraq.
Three tours, boss.
He kept going back.
If he stayed, he might still be alive.
Hypothetically, Boss.
- What else?
- Had some run-ins with the law.
- Arrests?
- Assault and battery, twice.
Here in DC, both cases were dismissed.
Maybe they gave him favorable treatment because he was serving in Iraq.
Find out.
Tracking down his personnel officer, Boss.
- Cameras.
- Yeah
I tapped into Metro traffic cameras and a few parking lot surveillance networks, stitched together Abdul's route from the alley back to the mosque.
There's no sign of anything until here.
Can't get a reading on the man's face, but he did go into the alley.
Back it up.
Stop.
Tighter his hands.
He was carrying a phone.
Forward.
Stop.
- Must have dumped it.
- McGee.
Already ran the phone records, Boss.
His cell didn't send or receive any calls that day.
- Find it.
- On it.
Probie, you start the search near the crime scene.
We'll meet you there later.
David, with me.
Captain's right down here.
I'm sorry, the correct answer is "Full Metal Jacket".
That was not the best Marine movie.
"A Few Good Men" was.
Based on the fact that I'm right, I'm overruling you.
If you're here to volunteer,
- we'll take you.
- I already have a job, Captain Mills.
NCIS.
We're here about a Marine.
Abdul Bakr.
You were his personnel officer.
Yeah,
First FAST Company.
He's in Iraq.
No, he's in our morgue.
He was murdered earlier today.
God.
- He's such a good kid.
- Well, we know he had some troubles.
A few fights, he never started 'em.
We would like to see his personnel records.
Sure, I'll...
I'll get you everything I got.
You coach?
Yeah, I'm a parole officer in civilian life.
- We have an after-school league.
- Civilian life?
I'm a reservist, recalled for active duty last year.
Manpower issues.
Iraq?
Iraq.
So, a parole officer and a personnel officer, that's kind of the same thing, isn't it?
Yeah, the Marine Corps likes to place reservists in similar lines of work.
Makes things run more efficiently.
So in your professional opinion, you think Lance Corporal Bakr's run-ins could have led to his murder?
Maybe someone he had a fight with came back?
Nobody stayed mad at him.
He was a good kid and a great Marine.
And a Muslim.
Yeah.
That's what the fights were about.
He stuck up for his people.
Hard to be a Muslim and a Marine.
Was he ever sympathetic to un-American activities?
No way.
Not this kid.
Ducky.
Just a moment, Jethro.
Is the needle in his femoral artery, Mr. Palmer?
Yes, Doctor.
Good.
Never seen a gunshot victim with so much blood left in his body.
Rare but not unheard of.
And if the bullet pierced his heart, it would have stopped pumping instantly.
And of course the pressure of the boards on his back may have prevented gravitational loss.
Right, that should do it.
Take those up to Abby.
Get her to run the usual tox screen.
Right away.
Neatly done, Mr. Palmer.
Thank you, Doctor.
That young man will make a first class medical examiner one of these days.
Today?
Yeah, well, until I open him up, I can't say for sure.
But all indications are that he was killed by the gunshot wound.
There are no defensive wounds, no lacerations, no abrasions, no contusions.
And unless I find intradermal bruising, no signs of a struggle.
A Marine with combat experience let someone take his weapon away from him without a fight?
Well, I only tell you what the body tells me.
Ask different questions, Duck.
I will, Jethro.
I assure you.
Yes, well, the first question is, what damage did that bullet exactly do?
Ducky, wait...
Need to talk to you.
Mr. Bakr has something to say.
Dr. Mallard, please don't cut into him.
I beg you to respect our religion.
So my son can find peace in heaven.
With all due respect, we have to.
I beg of you, please don't do this.
Sorry, there's no choice.
There is a choice, Jethro.
Mine.
I can't do this autopsy.
So what are you saying exactly?
That we have an obligation to honor faith as well as science, and in this case, the wishes of the family.
We cannot waive an autopsy in the middle of a murder investigation.
- Why not?
- Because the laws are very specific.
We can try to accommodate some aspect of tradition or religious ceremony, but we can't forfeit the most critical aspect of the investigation.
Abdul Bakr was a Marine who died as a hero.
That young man risked his life for this country.
The least we can do is to respect him in death.
He didn't die in Iraq, Ducky.
Well, but that's not the point!
What is the point, Duck?
This country was founded on freedom, religious freedom.
That family came here to practice it, and I can't ignore a basic tenet of their beliefs:
that if I cut open the body, that will prevent their son from finding peace in heaven.
There is no greater sin.
What about murder?
We need to find a cause of death.
We need to find evidence.
You need to do the autopsy.
That's it.
All right, I'll do it.
Under protest.
I have another body to examine.
So this will have to wait.
Why?
I already told you why.
Why?
This case brings back memories of a mass grave.
I was a volunteer medical examiner for a UN task force in Bosnia in '93.
I did 44 autopsies in five days, most of them children under 12, all Muslims.
The village was targeted because of who they were or who they weren't.
Nothing more.
Selected for their ethnicity.
The parents begged me not to autopsy their children.
Begged me on their knees.
But I had no choice.
I suppose I still don't.
I'll give you my report when I'm done.
His phone's got to be around here somewhere.
Waiting.
"Juicy Fruit".
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Next".
Close enough.
"Hell, the fall will probably kill you."
"Butch Cassidy and the Sunrise Kid".
Great scene.
Jumping off the cliff.
Did you try calling the cell?
Yeah.
It's on silent mode, or else I would have heard it.
Found it.
You scared the hell out of me.
- Sir.
- You lose something?
No, just escaped.
Gotcha.
Broken?
Does a baby change its own diapers?
Nay.
Does it burp and feed itself?
I don't think so.
It takes a lot of TLC to keep my children happy and... and fully functioning in the lab of Abby, or
"Labby," as I like to call it.
You're my favorite.
Labby?
You want results, you got 'em.
Yeah, I want 'em.
First.
Fingerprints.
There were a bajillion of them, all on Lance Corporal's Koran, his clothes, but none on his misbaha.
His what?
Misbaha.
Muslim prayer beads.
It's kind of like a rosary, but different.
- And?
- I ran all the fingerprints through AFIS, Interpol, the FBI.
Several worshiped at the same mosque, but there's nothing to connect any of them to this crime.
Right.
Go on.
Abdul's prayer rug and his boots tested positive for phosphorus, saltpeter, Semtex and C-4.
Explosives.
Yeah, which could mean one of two things.
Give 'em both to me.
He was serving in Iraq with FAST company a couple of weeks ago.
So if he was defusing and handling IED's, that would account for the traces of explosives.
Or?
Or...
he was handling them once he got back.
That would not be good.
Terrorism.
I cloned and mirrored
Bakr's hard drive from his laptop.
He recently visited three Jihadist websites.
It's training videos.
Suicide bomber's last statements.
Anti-American everything.
These sites are known hubs for al Qaeda communication.
Lance Corporal Bakr visited these?
Well, either him or someone that had access to his computer.
His father?
Good work.
Back to your babies.
Hey.
- Thought you checked phone records?
- I did.
Technically, Abdul never placed a call or sent a text.
He did, however, press 11 keys, before tossing his phone up on the roof.
He wanted us to find it.
Code.
Well, basic Marine letter substitution.
- Crude but very effective.
- And?
Well, he may have named his killer, Boss.
Hans Staiger.
Suspected ties to al Qaeda in Germany.
Known as the "Recruiter".
Attempted to buy off several customs officials in France last year.
Got away.
Where?
There's no record of Staiger coming into this country or anywhere else.
He could be here with false papers.
Find him.
We looked.
If he's here, he's way underground.
Dig deeper.
- Where?
- Mosque.
Bug it.
That's where this all started.
Getting a warrant.
Would be easier if Bakr just sent us a text message.
Not if he thought someone was monitoring or intercepting his cell transmissions.
Someone was following him, Tony.
"Three Days of the Condor"?
Based on the novel "Six Days of the Condor" by James Grady.
Hey, I got one for you two.
Find out who killed my Marine.
Nobody likes a know-it-all.
Gibbs does.
Warrant just came through.
Anyone else have a problem with this?
Bugging a place of worship?
Check.
One, two, three, four.
If this were a Catholic church or a doctor's office, we'd still be judge-hunting.
I agree.
It should not be so easy bugging a mosque.
Give it to me.
I'm going in.
You're a woman.
It'd be easier for me to blend in.
- Yes, you would blend right in.
- All right, then we'll flip for it.
If I flip you, you will get hurt.
You can take her, Probie.
Do it.
Compromise.
Tony will do it.
I don't want to do it.
That's impossible.
We haven't even planted a bug yet.
There's a transmission coming from inside the mosque.
It's already being bugged?
We tracked the signal back to the FBI frequency, Mr. Langer.
I checked and no warrant was issued to the FBI.
I can't confirm or deny if the mosque is under FBI observation.
This is a murder investigation.
Some interagency cooperation would be nice.
Anything we should know?
Not that I can tell you.
That's crap.
We both know that you can say anything you want to.
Did I come at a bad time?
Jethro.
- How are you?
- How'd they let you in here, newbie?
Man, it's been a long time.
You two know each other.
How nice.
Taught him everything he's forgotten.
I thought you retired.
I tried.
You look good, old man.
Hey, listen, sorry about our inconvenient convergence here.
Our what?
Gibbs used to fine me for every three-dollar word I used.
How much?
- Three dollars a word.
- You owe me six.
See.
Marines.
No, actually, I started here.
Gibbs took me under his wing and then proceed to crush me.
Nothing you didn't deserve.
Left me no choice but to crawl over to the FBI.
Yeah, and they actually hired you.
Yeah, can you believe that?
Well, now maybe the NCIS and the FBI can cooperate on this investigation?
We may be observing the mosque.
Well, that's a little vague.
I can't tell you any more than that, Jethro.
You know that.
Okay.
Well, I hope we don't get in each other's way.
Well, now if you guys find anything out then...
You'll be the last to know.
Hey, come on.
Excuse me, Director.
Jethro, I think I have it.
Have what?
A way to find the cause of Lance Corporal Bakr's death.
You're going to do that autopsy?
No.
Well, yes.
Well, in, in a manner of speaking.
But a lot of people are going to have to look the other way.
Starting with you, Director.
Lost?
Actually, I was looking for Agent Gibbs.
He was just... just... upstairs a minute ago.
Can I help you?
Yeah.
You...
Maybe you could give him my card and ask him to call me.
I'm Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.
I'm in charge here.
Well, hey, I'm Special Agent Brent Langer FBI.
You know that's weird.
I could've sworn that Agent Gibbs said he was in charge.
He is.
Well, yeah, he's in charge when he's here, but when he's not here, I'm in charge.
I'm in charge.
Well, I'll just call him later.
But thanks anyway.
What an ass.
Yes, indeed.
You're Langer-leering.
You're leering at Langer.
What if I am, Tony?
He's cute.
- "Cute".
He's not cute.
He's like...
- Don't speak.
"Bullets Over Broadway".
Woody Allen.
Very good.
You'd get a "B" in my class.
- I could teach your class.
- Yeah, right.
Officer David.
I'm going to need you to come down to the evidence garage, and I need you to bring someone with you.
The key here, Jethro, is discretion.
We're not going through official channels, Mr. Palmer.
Official channels take time.
That's the one thing we don't have.
Muslims desire their dead to be buried within 24 hours.
That leaves us 13.
- Doctor.
- Doctor.
You have 20 minutes.
A minute longer, you'll get found out and I'll get fired.
Clear?
How do I repay you?
I just repaid you.
We're even now.
Something wrong, Mr. Palmer?
If this weren't a Muslim family, we wouldn't be here.
That is correct.
I don't think anyone should get special treatment.
We're risking our careers by doing this.
You can always leave.
- Doctor, I wasn't with you in Bosnia.
- True.
And I certainly wasn't on the Crusades.
But 9/11.
The Intifada.
Hamas.
You have a problem with Muslims, Mr. Palmer?
No.
No, I do not.
But it seems like they have a problem with us.
Religions have been the basis of conflict for generations.
- So we just live with this?
- Until we learn to respect one another.
All right, Mr. Palmer, let's follow the path of the bullet.
The resolution's astonishing.
Yes, and magnification...
You can actually almost see as well as a traditional autopsy.
Angle of the trajectory indicates the bullet traveled through the first intercostal space avoiding the heart and bronchial branch of the lungs.
Missed all vital organs.
Went to the third intercostal space and exited the back.
Hold your horses.
There seems to be a bullet fragment chipped off the eighth rib and then disappeared.
There's no other exit wounds.
Is the fragment still in his body?
Density's becoming an issue.
We're seeing too much bone and not enough soft tissue.
MRI?
Excellent idea.
Tea?
You shouldn't have, but thank you.
Well, if you change your mind.
You're an Israeli Jew, no?
Yes.
I used to take my family to Haifa.
I spent my summers in Haifa.
No, just push it to one side.
You make it Arab style?
Strong.
I like strong.
You like Muslims?
Yes.
May I ask why?
I mean, I don't wish to offend you.
I'm just curious.
When you grow up in Israel, most of your neighbors are Muslim.
My best friend was Muslim Arab.
He was a young boy.
We were very close.
Are you still close?
No.
He was killed when I was 12.
By an Israeli missile strike on a hotel.
There has been too much death.
I agree.
Come on now.
Show us this bullet fragment.
What is it, Mr. Palmer?
It's moving.
His neck.
Is that a bullet fragment?
No, bullets are lead.
They're non-magnetic.
Turn off the power.
What is it?
This, my dear Officer David, is what you call an unexpected turn of events.
Abby.
Yay!
It worked.
- What?
- My Gibbs early warning alarm system.
The Arabs used to put dried brush outside their tents to alert them in case there was an intruder.
So I just updated it to bubble wrap.
You called me.
I know.
It was a test.
You want to know what I found.
Trippy.
I like it.
I was able to extract an undiluted sample from inside the needle shaft.
And voilà, I give you the blue-ringed octopus.
A what?
It produces a toxin that's a hundred times more deadly than cobra venom.
It's the most deadly natural neurotoxin on the planet, and it's impossible to trace in the bloodstream.
You did.
Well, because it wasn't in the bloodstream.
It was still inside the needle shaft Ducky found, perfectly preserved and pure.
He walked a long way.
Because the needle snapped off during insertion.
It was a result of oxidation and age, so that resulted in metal fatigue.
Lance Corporal Bakr, he only got a partial dose.
That's why he could walk for two blocks.
- Yeah, but it killed him.
- Yeah... or the bullet.
I mean, it's hard to say.
I'm running the toxicology now.
Aren't you gonna ask me?
What?
Why the needle was affected by magnetic force.
I mean, they make these out of 440 carbon.
It's a non-magnetic steel.
Why?
Because...
the needle was really old.
It was, like, from the '70s.
Not that that's...
That's not old.
I mean, well, it's old for a needle, sure, but it's certainly not old for, you know, a man.
Where?
There's two companies in the United States that handle the toxin.
They use it for research on antivenoms.
- They're both in the DC area.
- Names?
- Morgan Industries and Bio-Tonics.
- Have an e-mail sent...
I already e-mailed it to McGee and Tony.
You're my favorite.
Abs...
Lose the bubble wrap.
Go, McGoo.
Morgan Industries is clean.
Got it.
Probie's over at Morgan Industries.
They show no missing venom.
Can I help you?
Yes, we need to check your records.
You see?
Every drop accounted for.
- There's none missing from inventory.
- Check again.
I've checked four times.
I'm telling you, we watch this stuff.
Here you go.
Okay.
"Paycheck".
- Ben Affleck, Uma Thurman?
- That's right.
Ben plays the bad guy, does dirty work for this company and then they erase his memory.
Beats the bad guys by mailing clues to himself.
We are going to need all your shipping manifests.
Originals.
Everything that's been sent out of here in the last six months.
McGee can go back and do the same at Morgan Industries.
That's a lot of inventory to check.
We got time.
Okay.
Hey!
Where are you going, Jackrabbit?
I'm going to paradise.
- Where are you going?
- To the parking lot.
Put your butt in the back of our car.
Go.
Hacked into Bio-Tonics worldwide tracking software.
We followed a shipment of the neurotoxin from Bio-Tonics to Stanford University, except the university never received the shipment.
But as you can see, Bio-Tonics tracking shows that the venom was ordered and delivered.
- Who signed for it?
- Nobody.
It never got there.
It turns out that the university never even ordered the neurotoxin, so there was nothing missing from the warehouse.
Enabling them to walk out the front door with it.
- Who?
- Ryan Sikes, shipping clerk.
Thinks he's a jackrabbit.
And an ex-con.
Did time for armed robbery, computer crimes, other assorted tidbits.
In prison, he converted to Islam.
- Get him.
- Got him.
Good.
There is only one God and He is great.
That's good to know.
Why'd you kill Corporal Bakr?
Why has this country killed a hundred thousand Iraqi civilians and 30,000 sick children after they invaded the first time?
Corporal Bakr was a Muslim.
You're a Muslim.
Killing him, that's a sin.
How many civilians have the Marines killed on Muslim soil?
I'm talking about a Marine on American soil.
Ryan.
Ryan is my slave name.
My real name is Akbur
Mohammed.
Your slave name?
Yes.
You want a statement?
Death to America.
You want a confession?
I did it.
I killed that turncoat bastard.
He turned against his own people...
Hey, what are you...?
!
He didn't even look.
Gibbs doesn't need to.
Get in here!
Were you gonna tell me about this?
The ankle bracelet was a condition of his parole.
We have requested the tracking records from the parole office.
Be able to put him in the alley at exactly the time Abdul was killed.
I already confessed.
Now, I killed him.
Boss?
Bad news.
Just got the tracking records back.
GPS records show that Sikes was 20 miles away from the crime scene at the time of the murder.
He's got an airtight alibi, the US government.
Waiting on you, newbie.
Are you still working on this damn boat?
Finished it twice.
This is number three.
And still drinking the same beer.
So, yes, we think the mosque is a recruitment center for al Qaeda.
The cell in DC?
No.
Al Qaeda's changed their business model.
We think they're paying people now, cash, to Muslims and non-Muslims, US citizens.
Capitalist jihad.
Smart.
More like dangerous.
We're pretty good at monitoring radicalized citizens, but, now, anyone with a need or greed might be playing on their team, who knows.
- You think our murder is connected?
- Possible.
The dead Marine's father, he's on our watch list.
Why?
Everything we've got is on this, and it's not much.
To be perfectly honest with you, I'm not even sure why we're investigating.
Homeland is working on something, but it's so compartmentalized, no one's sharing.
MP3 files.
Last six months of recordings from inside the mosque.
- Thanks.
- Don't thank me.
I was never here.
You ever consider using power tools?
You are still a pain in the ass.
I learned from the best.
Catch you later, Boss.
Khalid is asking for some money to be made as a donation to the mosque.
This other man is speaking Arabic, but it is not his first language.
Think he could be German.
What's he saying?
Khalid is accepting cash paid through an offshore account.
Running the voices through Interpol, FBI and databases.
Start with Hans Staiger.
Positive ID, boss, it's Staiger.
Suspected al Qaeda recruiter.
Wanted in four countries.
No face, no prints, just calls intercepted over the last year.
We don't know who he is, just that he is.
And that he's talking to Khalid.
You're okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
The funeral home is sending a car.
- Thank you, again.
- Thank you.
Your son was a great credit to his country and his culture.
Jethro, he family has requested his personal effects to be returned.
Anything you want to tell me?
About?
Anything.
- Why do you hate us?
- I don't.
Your people do.
All we ask for, is to live in peace and observe our beliefs.
I think you are.
Islam came to your country with hostility in 2001, and that was wrong.
But you came to our land 500 years ago and you've never left.
All we wish for, is to be left alone to practice our ways, and yet you cannot leave us alone.
Why?
Why did the recruiter kill your son, because he said "no"
or because he said "yes"?
There is a man.
- A German.
- Hans Staiger.
He recruits for al Qaeda.
This recruiter approached my son.
Abdul was gathering information for the authorities.
A spy for his government.
I called the FBI.
I called them to investigate my own mosque.
I killed my own son.
No, you didn't.
But until we find who did, we need to keep his body a little longer.
Find this recruiter and allow me to have my vengeance.
Please.
He's mine.
The body stays, Duck.
I already released the body.
Well, un-release it.
I determined a cause of death.
The poison may have weakened his system, but it was the gunshot that killed him.
The body stays.
Until we find our killer.
- I have killed for less.
- You cheated.
- Did not.
- Yes, you did.
That is a book of movies.
I bet you never saw all those movies, you just read the book.
- I like books.
- I like movies.
Don't quote books, I will not quote movies.
What if it's a book that's been made into a movie?
Patterns.
George C. Scott, 1970, won seven Academy Awards,
- including Best Picture, boss.
- Patterns.
Patterns, not "Patton".
Patterns?
If this is al Qaeda, that means activity.
Activity means patterns.
Dead Marines who are Muslims.
Checking.
That's all we've got, two of them.
A Shiite Muslim stationed at Camp David.
Died of unknown causes two weeks ago.
Sergeant Major out of Norfolk, Sunni, died last week.
Both were stationed in Iraq, both had run-ins with the law.
- Both died of natural causes.
- They have something else in common.
- What?
- They're both dead.
No.
Something else.
- What?
- What?
Same personnel officer.
Look,
I'm a patriot.
I'm a volunteer reservist.
With money problems.
You're divorcing your wife, claimed you were broke in court, you oversee a lot of drug addicts, access to needles, access to Brian Sikes.
Which gave you access to the toxins used to kill three Marines.
We found $270,000 in your shed.
I guess your money problems are over.
What exactly are you charging me with?
A German named Hans Staiger was paying you to help recruit troubled Muslim Marines to serve for the other side.
Two of them obviously refused and are now dead.
I'm a parole officer,
I know how the system works.
Lawyer...
- right now.
- You killed a Marine yesterday.
- Shot him with his own gun.
- Why would I do that?
To make sure he was dead.
"Natural causes" didn't work as well for him as it did for the other two, so you followed him and you shot him.
Lawyer.
Boss.
Sorry.
Ducky needs you.
Now.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I was wrong.
- About what?
- The gunshot.
Abby's toxicology report.
Abdul was dead before he was shot.
Some of the poison did get into his system.
If your personnel officer did shoot him, he didn't kill him.
The most you could legally prove is that he desecrated a body.
If we don't have him for murder, he'll never give up the recruiter.
We just matched the slug from Abdul's body to your gun, not his.
- That's impossible.
- Yeah.
And a good lawyer could prove that, but you're not getting a lawyer.
You're getting a transfer to a Naval base in Cuba.
It's called Gitmo.
Ever heard of it?
Case closed.
I can give you Staiger.
He's the one who injected Corporal Bakr, and the other two Marines when they wouldn't cooperate.
He said it'd be quick.
The needle broke, so he followed him from the mosque, he shot him.
You just happened to be there?
I was the go-between.
You want more?
I want a civilian case, filed with the DA's Office, with the guarantee that I won't be prosecuted for terrorism.
Deal.
Staiger.
Bedford Hotel.
Room 126.
These belong to Abdul.
They were returned to his father.
Are you sure?
Gibbs, I...
No, nothing like them.
I didn't think so.
Allah, in his wisdom and greatness, has given us each a gift.
A gift that we must share with others.
Even if they do not wish to accept it.
It is our obligation to share Islam with non-believers.
So that we may save them from themselves.
NCIS Season 5 Episode 11 Tribes (Version LOL V1.0)
My husband.
You were anxious to talk to him, weren't you?
That's a movie.
I'm starting to get over the idea...
Not just any movie.
That's "Double Identity".
Your power of observation is unearthly.
Now, leave me alone.
This is the best part.
I not gonna get between a chick and a flick.
How do you know it's the best part?
Because it is the third time I have seen it.
You don't even watch movies.
This is not a movie.
It's a classic film.
Yeah, I know that.
You don't know that.
Film studies?
Well...
I really appreciate that, Ziva.
Really, I do.
I am taking it because it is the best way to pick up American colloquialism, like "bug off."
You should watch "Fast Times at Ridgemont High".
I saw it last week.
Sean Penn is a genius.
Phoebe Cates is a babe.
Now, do you mind?
- I can get you a list...
- I have a list!
Bye.
Morning, Probie Pan.
Where'd you pick that up?
Neverland?
No, Pottery Den.
50% off.
Got six of them for ten dollars.
That's pretty big, don't you think?
Well, I don't like getting refills ten times a day.
Well, but I mean, that's a little...
A little what?
Seuss-ical?
Leave.
I'm enjoying my moment.
Am I the only normal one here?
No.
Morning, Boss.
Marine killed.
Let's go.
Shotgun.
Anacostia and 18th, not the battlefield he thought he'd die on.
Baghdad's safer than this neighborhood.
Hey.
What do we got?
Ring, watch, and wallet are missing.
Government issue.
Could be the murder weapon.
A Marine killed with his own gun?
Nearly 30% of all gun-related deaths are the results of the owner's own weapon.
Your first impressions, Mr. Palmer?
Well, there should be much more blood loss evident.
Based upon?
Based on the position of the body, even with the heart slightly elevated.
Precisely even with a gunshot that high in the thoracic cavity, one would expect more
- blood loss.
- Meaning?
Meaning I'm not going to say anything else until I've examined the body more closely.
The gurney, please, Mr. Palmer.
Right away, Doctor.
Good lad.
Good Marine.
Sunni.
- How do you know that?
- If he were a Shiite, he'd have a turba with him.
Like Hadji on "Johnny Quest".
No, I believe that's a turban, Tony.
A turba is a small stone tablet that the Shiites set their forehead on while praying.
The devout develop a callus.
Ziva.
Checking for local Sunni mosques.
McGee.
Checking all security cameras.
Got it.
There's a Sunni mosque two blocks east.
Show me.
She cannot come in here.
Women are not allowed.
I will wait outside.
Federal agents.
She's with me.
She is welcome here.
As you are.
I'm sure you understand traditions.
We do not wish to offend anyone.
I am Jewish.
I do understand tradition.
You... wish to ask me questions?
No.
Then, you wish to speak to every man who worships here under the age of 30.
No.
Then what?
We think this man may have attended your mosque.
And what has he done?
Nothing.
He is dead, killed two blocks from here.
Do you know him?
Stahf'Allah.
This is my son.
Your son have any enemies?
Yes.
Ignorance, intolerance, and hatred.
Any with a first name?
We would like your permission to look at Abdul's things.
I'll need to tell the family what has happened.
We will have someone drive you.
Thank you.
You wait here.
Please.
Come on.
Guy was with his son right before he died.
Suspect.
Victim.
Abdul Mohammed Bakr, age 23, Lance Corporal.
Served in First FAST Company.
Bronze Star and Purple Heart for service in Iraq.
Three tours, boss.
He kept going back.
If he stayed, he might still be alive.
Hypothetically, Boss.
- What else?
- Had some run-ins with the law.
- Arrests?
- Assault and battery, twice.
Here in DC, both cases were dismissed.
Maybe they gave him favorable treatment because he was serving in Iraq.
Find out.
Tracking down his personnel officer, Boss.
- Cameras.
- Yeah
I tapped into Metro traffic cameras and a few parking lot surveillance networks, stitched together Abdul's route from the alley back to the mosque.
There's no sign of anything until here.
Can't get a reading on the man's face, but he did go into the alley.
Back it up.
Stop.
Tighter his hands.
He was carrying a phone.
Forward.
Stop.
- Must have dumped it.
- McGee.
Already ran the phone records, Boss.
His cell didn't send or receive any calls that day.
- Find it.
- On it.
Probie, you start the search near the crime scene.
We'll meet you there later.
David, with me.
Captain's right down here.
I'm sorry, the correct answer is "Full Metal Jacket".
That was not the best Marine movie.
"A Few Good Men" was.
Based on the fact that I'm right, I'm overruling you.
If you're here to volunteer,
- we'll take you.
- I already have a job, Captain Mills.
NCIS.
We're here about a Marine.
Abdul Bakr.
You were his personnel officer.
Yeah,
First FAST Company.
He's in Iraq.
No, he's in our morgue.
He was murdered earlier today.
God.
- He's such a good kid.
- Well, we know he had some troubles.
A few fights, he never started 'em.
We would like to see his personnel records.
Sure, I'll...
I'll get you everything I got.
You coach?
Yeah, I'm a parole officer in civilian life.
- We have an after-school league.
- Civilian life?
I'm a reservist, recalled for active duty last year.
Manpower issues.
Iraq?
Iraq.
So, a parole officer and a personnel officer, that's kind of the same thing, isn't it?
Yeah, the Marine Corps likes to place reservists in similar lines of work.
Makes things run more efficiently.
So in your professional opinion, you think Lance Corporal Bakr's run-ins could have led to his murder?
Maybe someone he had a fight with came back?
Nobody stayed mad at him.
He was a good kid and a great Marine.
And a Muslim.
Yeah.
That's what the fights were about.
He stuck up for his people.
Hard to be a Muslim and a Marine.
Was he ever sympathetic to un-American activities?
No way.
Not this kid.
Ducky.
Just a moment, Jethro.
Is the needle in his femoral artery, Mr. Palmer?
Yes, Doctor.
Good.
Never seen a gunshot victim with so much blood left in his body.
Rare but not unheard of.
And if the bullet pierced his heart, it would have stopped pumping instantly.
And of course the pressure of the boards on his back may have prevented gravitational loss.
Right, that should do it.
Take those up to Abby.
Get her to run the usual tox screen.
Right away.
Neatly done, Mr. Palmer.
Thank you, Doctor.
That young man will make a first class medical examiner one of these days.
Today?
Yeah, well, until I open him up, I can't say for sure.
But all indications are that he was killed by the gunshot wound.
There are no defensive wounds, no lacerations, no abrasions, no contusions.
And unless I find intradermal bruising, no signs of a struggle.
A Marine with combat experience let someone take his weapon away from him without a fight?
Well, I only tell you what the body tells me.
Ask different questions, Duck.
I will, Jethro.
I assure you.
Yes, well, the first question is, what damage did that bullet exactly do?
Ducky, wait...
Need to talk to you.
Mr. Bakr has something to say.
Dr. Mallard, please don't cut into him.
I beg you to respect our religion.
So my son can find peace in heaven.
With all due respect, we have to.
I beg of you, please don't do this.
Sorry, there's no choice.
There is a choice, Jethro.
Mine.
I can't do this autopsy.
So what are you saying exactly?
That we have an obligation to honor faith as well as science, and in this case, the wishes of the family.
We cannot waive an autopsy in the middle of a murder investigation.
- Why not?
- Because the laws are very specific.
We can try to accommodate some aspect of tradition or religious ceremony, but we can't forfeit the most critical aspect of the investigation.
Abdul Bakr was a Marine who died as a hero.
That young man risked his life for this country.
The least we can do is to respect him in death.
He didn't die in Iraq, Ducky.
Well, but that's not the point!
What is the point, Duck?
This country was founded on freedom, religious freedom.
That family came here to practice it, and I can't ignore a basic tenet of their beliefs:
that if I cut open the body, that will prevent their son from finding peace in heaven.
There is no greater sin.
What about murder?
We need to find a cause of death.
We need to find evidence.
You need to do the autopsy.
That's it.
All right, I'll do it.
Under protest.
I have another body to examine.
So this will have to wait.
Why?
I already told you why.
Why?
This case brings back memories of a mass grave.
I was a volunteer medical examiner for a UN task force in Bosnia in '93.
I did 44 autopsies in five days, most of them children under 12, all Muslims.
The village was targeted because of who they were or who they weren't.
Nothing more.
Selected for their ethnicity.
The parents begged me not to autopsy their children.
Begged me on their knees.
But I had no choice.
I suppose I still don't.
I'll give you my report when I'm done.
His phone's got to be around here somewhere.
Waiting.
"Juicy Fruit".
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Next".
Close enough.
"Hell, the fall will probably kill you."
"Butch Cassidy and the Sunrise Kid".
Great scene.
Jumping off the cliff.
Did you try calling the cell?
Yeah.
It's on silent mode, or else I would have heard it.
Found it.
You scared the hell out of me.
- Sir.
- You lose something?
No, just escaped.
Gotcha.
Broken?
Does a baby change its own diapers?
Nay.
Does it burp and feed itself?
I don't think so.
It takes a lot of TLC to keep my children happy and... and fully functioning in the lab of Abby, or
"Labby," as I like to call it.
You're my favorite.
Labby?
You want results, you got 'em.
Yeah, I want 'em.
First.
Fingerprints.
There were a bajillion of them, all on Lance Corporal's Koran, his clothes, but none on his misbaha.
His what?
Misbaha.
Muslim prayer beads.
It's kind of like a rosary, but different.
- And?
- I ran all the fingerprints through AFIS, Interpol, the FBI.
Several worshiped at the same mosque, but there's nothing to connect any of them to this crime.
Right.
Go on.
Abdul's prayer rug and his boots tested positive for phosphorus, saltpeter, Semtex and C-4.
Explosives.
Yeah, which could mean one of two things.
Give 'em both to me.
He was serving in Iraq with FAST company a couple of weeks ago.
So if he was defusing and handling IED's, that would account for the traces of explosives.
Or?
Or...
he was handling them once he got back.
That would not be good.
Terrorism.
I cloned and mirrored
Bakr's hard drive from his laptop.
He recently visited three Jihadist websites.
It's training videos.
Suicide bomber's last statements.
Anti-American everything.
These sites are known hubs for al Qaeda communication.
Lance Corporal Bakr visited these?
Well, either him or someone that had access to his computer.
His father?
Good work.
Back to your babies.
Hey.
- Thought you checked phone records?
- I did.
Technically, Abdul never placed a call or sent a text.
He did, however, press 11 keys, before tossing his phone up on the roof.
He wanted us to find it.
Code.
Well, basic Marine letter substitution.
- Crude but very effective.
- And?
Well, he may have named his killer, Boss.
Hans Staiger.
Suspected ties to al Qaeda in Germany.
Known as the "Recruiter".
Attempted to buy off several customs officials in France last year.
Got away.
Where?
There's no record of Staiger coming into this country or anywhere else.
He could be here with false papers.
Find him.
We looked.
If he's here, he's way underground.
Dig deeper.
- Where?
- Mosque.
Bug it.
That's where this all started.
Getting a warrant.
Would be easier if Bakr just sent us a text message.
Not if he thought someone was monitoring or intercepting his cell transmissions.
Someone was following him, Tony.
"Three Days of the Condor"?
Based on the novel "Six Days of the Condor" by James Grady.
Hey, I got one for you two.
Find out who killed my Marine.
Nobody likes a know-it-all.
Gibbs does.
Warrant just came through.
Anyone else have a problem with this?
Bugging a place of worship?
Check.
One, two, three, four.
If this were a Catholic church or a doctor's office, we'd still be judge-hunting.
I agree.
It should not be so easy bugging a mosque.
Give it to me.
I'm going in.
You're a woman.
It'd be easier for me to blend in.
- Yes, you would blend right in.
- All right, then we'll flip for it.
If I flip you, you will get hurt.
You can take her, Probie.
Do it.
Compromise.
Tony will do it.
I don't want to do it.
That's impossible.
We haven't even planted a bug yet.
There's a transmission coming from inside the mosque.
It's already being bugged?
We tracked the signal back to the FBI frequency, Mr. Langer.
I checked and no warrant was issued to the FBI.
I can't confirm or deny if the mosque is under FBI observation.
This is a murder investigation.
Some interagency cooperation would be nice.
Anything we should know?
Not that I can tell you.
That's crap.
We both know that you can say anything you want to.
Did I come at a bad time?
Jethro.
- How are you?
- How'd they let you in here, newbie?
Man, it's been a long time.
You two know each other.
How nice.
Taught him everything he's forgotten.
I thought you retired.
I tried.
You look good, old man.
Hey, listen, sorry about our inconvenient convergence here.
Our what?
Gibbs used to fine me for every three-dollar word I used.
How much?
- Three dollars a word.
- You owe me six.
See.
Marines.
No, actually, I started here.
Gibbs took me under his wing and then proceed to crush me.
Nothing you didn't deserve.
Left me no choice but to crawl over to the FBI.
Yeah, and they actually hired you.
Yeah, can you believe that?
Well, now maybe the NCIS and the FBI can cooperate on this investigation?
We may be observing the mosque.
Well, that's a little vague.
I can't tell you any more than that, Jethro.
You know that.
Okay.
Well, I hope we don't get in each other's way.
Well, now if you guys find anything out then...
You'll be the last to know.
Hey, come on.
Excuse me, Director.
Jethro, I think I have it.
Have what?
A way to find the cause of Lance Corporal Bakr's death.
You're going to do that autopsy?
No.
Well, yes.
Well, in, in a manner of speaking.
But a lot of people are going to have to look the other way.
Starting with you, Director.
Lost?
Actually, I was looking for Agent Gibbs.
He was just... just... upstairs a minute ago.
Can I help you?
Yeah.
You...
Maybe you could give him my card and ask him to call me.
I'm Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.
I'm in charge here.
Well, hey, I'm Special Agent Brent Langer FBI.
You know that's weird.
I could've sworn that Agent Gibbs said he was in charge.
He is.
Well, yeah, he's in charge when he's here, but when he's not here, I'm in charge.
I'm in charge.
Well, I'll just call him later.
But thanks anyway.
What an ass.
Yes, indeed.
You're Langer-leering.
You're leering at Langer.
What if I am, Tony?
He's cute.
- "Cute".
He's not cute.
He's like...
- Don't speak.
"Bullets Over Broadway".
Woody Allen.
Very good.
You'd get a "B" in my class.
- I could teach your class.
- Yeah, right.
Officer David.
I'm going to need you to come down to the evidence garage, and I need you to bring someone with you.
The key here, Jethro, is discretion.
We're not going through official channels, Mr. Palmer.
Official channels take time.
That's the one thing we don't have.
Muslims desire their dead to be buried within 24 hours.
That leaves us 13.
- Doctor.
- Doctor.
You have 20 minutes.
A minute longer, you'll get found out and I'll get fired.
Clear?
How do I repay you?
I just repaid you.
We're even now.
Something wrong, Mr. Palmer?
If this weren't a Muslim family, we wouldn't be here.
That is correct.
I don't think anyone should get special treatment.
We're risking our careers by doing this.
You can always leave.
- Doctor, I wasn't with you in Bosnia.
- True.
And I certainly wasn't on the Crusades.
But 9/11.
The Intifada.
Hamas.
You have a problem with Muslims, Mr. Palmer?
No.
No, I do not.
But it seems like they have a problem with us.
Religions have been the basis of conflict for generations.
- So we just live with this?
- Until we learn to respect one another.
All right, Mr. Palmer, let's follow the path of the bullet.
The resolution's astonishing.
Yes, and magnification...
You can actually almost see as well as a traditional autopsy.
Angle of the trajectory indicates the bullet traveled through the first intercostal space avoiding the heart and bronchial branch of the lungs.
Missed all vital organs.
Went to the third intercostal space and exited the back.
Hold your horses.
There seems to be a bullet fragment chipped off the eighth rib and then disappeared.
There's no other exit wounds.
Is the fragment still in his body?
Density's becoming an issue.
We're seeing too much bone and not enough soft tissue.
MRI?
Excellent idea.
Tea?
You shouldn't have, but thank you.
Well, if you change your mind.
You're an Israeli Jew, no?
Yes.
I used to take my family to Haifa.
I spent my summers in Haifa.
No, just push it to one side.
You make it Arab style?
Strong.
I like strong.
You like Muslims?
Yes.
May I ask why?
I mean, I don't wish to offend you.
I'm just curious.
When you grow up in Israel, most of your neighbors are Muslim.
My best friend was Muslim Arab.
He was a young boy.
We were very close.
Are you still close?
No.
He was killed when I was 12.
By an Israeli missile strike on a hotel.
There has been too much death.
I agree.
Come on now.
Show us this bullet fragment.
What is it, Mr. Palmer?
It's moving.
His neck.
Is that a bullet fragment?
No, bullets are lead.
They're non-magnetic.
Turn off the power.
What is it?
This, my dear Officer David, is what you call an unexpected turn of events.
Abby.
Yay!
It worked.
- What?
- My Gibbs early warning alarm system.
The Arabs used to put dried brush outside their tents to alert them in case there was an intruder.
So I just updated it to bubble wrap.
You called me.
I know.
It was a test.
You want to know what I found.
Trippy.
I like it.
I was able to extract an undiluted sample from inside the needle shaft.
And voilà, I give you the blue-ringed octopus.
A what?
It produces a toxin that's a hundred times more deadly than cobra venom.
It's the most deadly natural neurotoxin on the planet, and it's impossible to trace in the bloodstream.
You did.
Well, because it wasn't in the bloodstream.
It was still inside the needle shaft Ducky found, perfectly preserved and pure.
He walked a long way.
Because the needle snapped off during insertion.
It was a result of oxidation and age, so that resulted in metal fatigue.
Lance Corporal Bakr, he only got a partial dose.
That's why he could walk for two blocks.
- Yeah, but it killed him.
- Yeah... or the bullet.
I mean, it's hard to say.
I'm running the toxicology now.
Aren't you gonna ask me?
What?
Why the needle was affected by magnetic force.
I mean, they make these out of 440 carbon.
It's a non-magnetic steel.
Why?
Because...
the needle was really old.
It was, like, from the '70s.
Not that that's...
That's not old.
I mean, well, it's old for a needle, sure, but it's certainly not old for, you know, a man.
Where?
There's two companies in the United States that handle the toxin.
They use it for research on antivenoms.
- They're both in the DC area.
- Names?
- Morgan Industries and Bio-Tonics.
- Have an e-mail sent...
I already e-mailed it to McGee and Tony.
You're my favorite.
Abs...
Lose the bubble wrap.
Go, McGoo.
Morgan Industries is clean.
Got it.
Probie's over at Morgan Industries.
They show no missing venom.
Can I help you?
Yes, we need to check your records.
You see?
Every drop accounted for.
- There's none missing from inventory.
- Check again.
I've checked four times.
I'm telling you, we watch this stuff.
Here you go.
Okay.
"Paycheck".
- Ben Affleck, Uma Thurman?
- That's right.
Ben plays the bad guy, does dirty work for this company and then they erase his memory.
Beats the bad guys by mailing clues to himself.
We are going to need all your shipping manifests.
Originals.
Everything that's been sent out of here in the last six months.
McGee can go back and do the same at Morgan Industries.
That's a lot of inventory to check.
We got time.
Okay.
Hey!
Where are you going, Jackrabbit?
I'm going to paradise.
- Where are you going?
- To the parking lot.
Put your butt in the back of our car.
Go.
Hacked into Bio-Tonics worldwide tracking software.
We followed a shipment of the neurotoxin from Bio-Tonics to Stanford University, except the university never received the shipment.
But as you can see, Bio-Tonics tracking shows that the venom was ordered and delivered.
- Who signed for it?
- Nobody.
It never got there.
It turns out that the university never even ordered the neurotoxin, so there was nothing missing from the warehouse.
Enabling them to walk out the front door with it.
- Who?
- Ryan Sikes, shipping clerk.
Thinks he's a jackrabbit.
And an ex-con.
Did time for armed robbery, computer crimes, other assorted tidbits.
In prison, he converted to Islam.
- Get him.
- Got him.
Good.
There is only one God and He is great.
That's good to know.
Why'd you kill Corporal Bakr?
Why has this country killed a hundred thousand Iraqi civilians and 30,000 sick children after they invaded the first time?
Corporal Bakr was a Muslim.
You're a Muslim.
Killing him, that's a sin.
How many civilians have the Marines killed on Muslim soil?
I'm talking about a Marine on American soil.
Ryan.
Ryan is my slave name.
My real name is Akbur
Mohammed.
Your slave name?
Yes.
You want a statement?
Death to America.
You want a confession?
I did it.
I killed that turncoat bastard.
He turned against his own people...
Hey, what are you...?
!
He didn't even look.
Gibbs doesn't need to.
Get in here!
Were you gonna tell me about this?
The ankle bracelet was a condition of his parole.
We have requested the tracking records from the parole office.
Be able to put him in the alley at exactly the time Abdul was killed.
I already confessed.
Now, I killed him.
Boss?
Bad news.
Just got the tracking records back.
GPS records show that Sikes was 20 miles away from the crime scene at the time of the murder.
He's got an airtight alibi, the US government.
Waiting on you, newbie.
Are you still working on this damn boat?
Finished it twice.
This is number three.
And still drinking the same beer.
So, yes, we think the mosque is a recruitment center for al Qaeda.
The cell in DC?
No.
Al Qaeda's changed their business model.
We think they're paying people now, cash, to Muslims and non-Muslims, US citizens.
Capitalist jihad.
Smart.
More like dangerous.
We're pretty good at monitoring radicalized citizens, but, now, anyone with a need or greed might be playing on their team, who knows.
- You think our murder is connected?
- Possible.
The dead Marine's father, he's on our watch list.
Why?
Everything we've got is on this, and it's not much.
To be perfectly honest with you, I'm not even sure why we're investigating.
Homeland is working on something, but it's so compartmentalized, no one's sharing.
MP3 files.
Last six months of recordings from inside the mosque.
- Thanks.
- Don't thank me.
I was never here.
You ever consider using power tools?
You are still a pain in the ass.
I learned from the best.
Catch you later, Boss.
Khalid is asking for some money to be made as a donation to the mosque.
This other man is speaking Arabic, but it is not his first language.
Think he could be German.
What's he saying?
Khalid is accepting cash paid through an offshore account.
Running the voices through Interpol, FBI and databases.
Start with Hans Staiger.
Positive ID, boss, it's Staiger.
Suspected al Qaeda recruiter.
Wanted in four countries.
No face, no prints, just calls intercepted over the last year.
We don't know who he is, just that he is.
And that he's talking to Khalid.
You're okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
The funeral home is sending a car.
- Thank you, again.
- Thank you.
Your son was a great credit to his country and his culture.
Jethro, he family has requested his personal effects to be returned.
Anything you want to tell me?
About?
Anything.
- Why do you hate us?
- I don't.
Your people do.
All we ask for, is to live in peace and observe our beliefs.
I think you are.
Islam came to your country with hostility in 2001, and that was wrong.
But you came to our land 500 years ago and you've never left.
All we wish for, is to be left alone to practice our ways, and yet you cannot leave us alone.
Why?
Why did the recruiter kill your son, because he said "no"
or because he said "yes"?
There is a man.
- A German.
- Hans Staiger.
He recruits for al Qaeda.
This recruiter approached my son.
Abdul was gathering information for the authorities.
A spy for his government.
I called the FBI.
I called them to investigate my own mosque.
I killed my own son.
No, you didn't.
But until we find who did, we need to keep his body a little longer.
Find this recruiter and allow me to have my vengeance.
Please.
He's mine.
The body stays, Duck.
I already released the body.
Well, un-release it.
I determined a cause of death.
The poison may have weakened his system, but it was the gunshot that killed him.
The body stays.
Until we find our killer.
- I have killed for less.
- You cheated.
- Did not.
- Yes, you did.
That is a book of movies.
I bet you never saw all those movies, you just read the book.
- I like books.
- I like movies.
Don't quote books, I will not quote movies.
What if it's a book that's been made into a movie?
Patterns.
George C. Scott, 1970, won seven Academy Awards,
- including Best Picture, boss.
- Patterns.
Patterns, not "Patton".
Patterns?
If this is al Qaeda, that means activity.
Activity means patterns.
Dead Marines who are Muslims.
Checking.
That's all we've got, two of them.
A Shiite Muslim stationed at Camp David.
Died of unknown causes two weeks ago.
Sergeant Major out of Norfolk, Sunni, died last week.
Both were stationed in Iraq, both had run-ins with the law.
- Both died of natural causes.
- They have something else in common.
- What?
- They're both dead.
No.
Something else.
- What?
- What?
Same personnel officer.
Look,
I'm a patriot.
I'm a volunteer reservist.
With money problems.
You're divorcing your wife, claimed you were broke in court, you oversee a lot of drug addicts, access to needles, access to Brian Sikes.
Which gave you access to the toxins used to kill three Marines.
We found $270,000 in your shed.
I guess your money problems are over.
What exactly are you charging me with?
A German named Hans Staiger was paying you to help recruit troubled Muslim Marines to serve for the other side.
Two of them obviously refused and are now dead.
I'm a parole officer,
I know how the system works.
Lawyer...
- right now.
- You killed a Marine yesterday.
- Shot him with his own gun.
- Why would I do that?
To make sure he was dead.
"Natural causes" didn't work as well for him as it did for the other two, so you followed him and you shot him.
Lawyer.
Boss.
Sorry.
Ducky needs you.
Now.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I was wrong.
- About what?
- The gunshot.
Abby's toxicology report.
Abdul was dead before he was shot.
Some of the poison did get into his system.
If your personnel officer did shoot him, he didn't kill him.
The most you could legally prove is that he desecrated a body.
If we don't have him for murder, he'll never give up the recruiter.
We just matched the slug from Abdul's body to your gun, not his.
- That's impossible.
- Yeah.
And a good lawyer could prove that, but you're not getting a lawyer.
You're getting a transfer to a Naval base in Cuba.
It's called Gitmo.
Ever heard of it?
Case closed.
I can give you Staiger.
He's the one who injected Corporal Bakr, and the other two Marines when they wouldn't cooperate.
He said it'd be quick.
The needle broke, so he followed him from the mosque, he shot him.
You just happened to be there?
I was the go-between.
You want more?
I want a civilian case, filed with the DA's Office, with the guarantee that I won't be prosecuted for terrorism.
Deal.
Staiger.
Bedford Hotel.
Room 126.
These belong to Abdul.
They were returned to his father.
Are you sure?
Gibbs, I...
No, nothing like them.
I didn't think so.
Allah, in his wisdom and greatness, has given us each a gift.
A gift that we must share with others.
Even if they do not wish to accept it.
It is our obligation to share Islam with non-believers.
So that we may save them from themselves.
NCIS Season 5 Episode 11 Tribes (Version LOL V1.0)
My husband.
You were anxious to talk to him, weren't you?
That's a movie.
I'm starting to get over the idea...
Not just any movie.
That's "Double Identity".
Your power of observation is unearthly.
Now, leave me alone.
This is the best part.
I not gonna get between a chick and a flick.
How do you know it's the best part?
Because it is the third time I have seen it.
You don't even watch movies.
This is not a movie.
It's a classic film.
Yeah, I know that.
You don't know that.
Film studies?
Well...
I really appreciate that, Ziva.
Really, I do.
I am taking it because it is the best way to pick up American colloquialism, like "bug off."
You should watch "Fast Times at Ridgemont High".
I saw it last week.
Sean Penn is a genius.
Phoebe Cates is a babe.
Now, do you mind?
- I can get you a list...
- I have a list!
Bye.
Morning, Probie Pan.
Where'd you pick that up?
Neverland?
No, Pottery Den.
50% off.
Got six of them for ten dollars.
That's pretty big, don't you think?
Well, I don't like getting refills ten times a day.
Well, but I mean, that's a little...
A little what?
Seuss-ical?
Leave.
I'm enjoying my moment.
Am I the only normal one here?
No.
Morning, Boss.
Marine killed.
Let's go.
Shotgun.
Anacostia and 18th, not the battlefield he thought he'd die on.
Baghdad's safer than this neighborhood.
Hey.
What do we got?
Ring, watch, and wallet are missing.
Government issue.
Could be the murder weapon.
A Marine killed with his own gun?
Nearly 30% of all gun-related deaths are the results of the owner's own weapon.
Your first impressions, Mr. Palmer?
Well, there should be much more blood loss evident.
Based upon?
Based on the position of the body, even with the heart slightly elevated.
Precisely even with a gunshot that high in the thoracic cavity, one would expect more
- blood loss.
- Meaning?
Meaning I'm not going to say anything else until I've examined the body more closely.
The gurney, please, Mr. Palmer.
Right away, Doctor.
Good lad.
Good Marine.
Sunni.
- How do you know that?
- If he were a Shiite, he'd have a turba with him.
Like Hadji on "Johnny Quest".
No, I believe that's a turban, Tony.
A turba is a small stone tablet that the Shiites set their forehead on while praying.
The devout develop a callus.
Ziva.
Checking for local Sunni mosques.
McGee.
Checking all security cameras.
Got it.
There's a Sunni mosque two blocks east.
Show me.
She cannot come in here.
Women are not allowed.
I will wait outside.
Federal agents.
She's with me.
She is welcome here.
As you are.
I'm sure you understand traditions.
We do not wish to offend anyone.
I am Jewish.
I do understand tradition.
You... wish to ask me questions?
No.
Then, you wish to speak to every man who worships here under the age of 30.
No.
Then what?
We think this man may have attended your mosque.
And what has he done?
Nothing.
He is dead, killed two blocks from here.
Do you know him?
Stahf'Allah.
This is my son.
Your son have any enemies?
Yes.
Ignorance, intolerance, and hatred.
Any with a first name?
We would like your permission to look at Abdul's things.
I'll need to tell the family what has happened.
We will have someone drive you.
Thank you.
You wait here.
Please.
Come on.
Guy was with his son right before he died.
Suspect.
Victim.
Abdul Mohammed Bakr, age 23, Lance Corporal.
Served in First FAST Company.
Bronze Star and Purple Heart for service in Iraq.
Three tours, boss.
He kept going back.
If he stayed, he might still be alive.
Hypothetically, Boss.
- What else?
- Had some run-ins with the law.
- Arrests?
- Assault and battery, twice.
Here in DC, both cases were dismissed.
Maybe they gave him favorable treatment because he was serving in Iraq.
Find out.
Tracking down his personnel officer, Boss.
- Cameras.
- Yeah
I tapped into Metro traffic cameras and a few parking lot surveillance networks, stitched together Abdul's route from the alley back to the mosque.
There's no sign of anything until here.
Can't get a reading on the man's face, but he did go into the alley.
Back it up.
Stop.
Tighter his hands.
He was carrying a phone.
Forward.
Stop.
- Must have dumped it.
- McGee.
Already ran the phone records, Boss.
His cell didn't send or receive any calls that day.
- Find it.
- On it.
Probie, you start the search near the crime scene.
We'll meet you there later.
David, with me.
Captain's right down here.
I'm sorry, the correct answer is "Full Metal Jacket".
That was not the best Marine movie.
"A Few Good Men" was.
Based on the fact that I'm right, I'm overruling you.
If you're here to volunteer,
- we'll take you.
- I already have a job, Captain Mills.
NCIS.
We're here about a Marine.
Abdul Bakr.
You were his personnel officer.
Yeah,
First FAST Company.
He's in Iraq.
No, he's in our morgue.
He was murdered earlier today.
God.
- He's such a good kid.
- Well, we know he had some troubles.
A few fights, he never started 'em.
We would like to see his personnel records.
Sure, I'll...
I'll get you everything I got.
You coach?
Yeah, I'm a parole officer in civilian life.
- We have an after-school league.
- Civilian life?
I'm a reservist, recalled for active duty last year.
Manpower issues.
Iraq?
Iraq.
So, a parole officer and a personnel officer, that's kind of the same thing, isn't it?
Yeah, the Marine Corps likes to place reservists in similar lines of work.
Makes things run more efficiently.
So in your professional opinion, you think Lance Corporal Bakr's run-ins could have led to his murder?
Maybe someone he had a fight with came back?
Nobody stayed mad at him.
He was a good kid and a great Marine.
And a Muslim.
Yeah.
That's what the fights were about.
He stuck up for his people.
Hard to be a Muslim and a Marine.
Was he ever sympathetic to un-American activities?
No way.
Not this kid.
Ducky.
Just a moment, Jethro.
Is the needle in his femoral artery, Mr. Palmer?
Yes, Doctor.
Good.
Never seen a gunshot victim with so much blood left in his body.
Rare but not unheard of.
And if the bullet pierced his heart, it would have stopped pumping instantly.
And of course the pressure of the boards on his back may have prevented gravitational loss.
Right, that should do it.
Take those up to Abby.
Get her to run the usual tox screen.
Right away.
Neatly done, Mr. Palmer.
Thank you, Doctor.
That young man will make a first class medical examiner one of these days.
Today?
Yeah, well, until I open him up, I can't say for sure.
But all indications are that he was killed by the gunshot wound.
There are no defensive wounds, no lacerations, no abrasions, no contusions.
And unless I find intradermal bruising, no signs of a struggle.
A Marine with combat experience let someone take his weapon away from him without a fight?
Well, I only tell you what the body tells me.
Ask different questions, Duck.
I will, Jethro.
I assure you.
Yes, well, the first question is, what damage did that bullet exactly do?
Ducky, wait...
Need to talk to you.
Mr. Bakr has something to say.
Dr. Mallard, please don't cut into him.
I beg you to respect our religion.
So my son can find peace in heaven.
With all due respect, we have to.
I beg of you, please don't do this.
Sorry, there's no choice.
There is a choice, Jethro.
Mine.
I can't do this autopsy.
So what are you saying exactly?
That we have an obligation to honor faith as well as science, and in this case, the wishes of the family.
We cannot waive an autopsy in the middle of a murder investigation.
- Why not?
- Because the laws are very specific.
We can try to accommodate some aspect of tradition or religious ceremony, but we can't forfeit the most critical aspect of the investigation.
Abdul Bakr was a Marine who died as a hero.
That young man risked his life for this country.
The least we can do is to respect him in death.
He didn't die in Iraq, Ducky.
Well, but that's not the point!
What is the point, Duck?
This country was founded on freedom, religious freedom.
That family came here to practice it, and I can't ignore a basic tenet of their beliefs:
that if I cut open the body, that will prevent their son from finding peace in heaven.
There is no greater sin.
What about murder?
We need to find a cause of death.
We need to find evidence.
You need to do the autopsy.
That's it.
All right, I'll do it.
Under protest.
I have another body to examine.
So this will have to wait.
Why?
I already told you why.
Why?
This case brings back memories of a mass grave.
I was a volunteer medical examiner for a UN task force in Bosnia in '93.
I did 44 autopsies in five days, most of them children under 12, all Muslims.
The village was targeted because of who they were or who they weren't.
Nothing more.
Selected for their ethnicity.
The parents begged me not to autopsy their children.
Begged me on their knees.
But I had no choice.
I suppose I still don't.
I'll give you my report when I'm done.
His phone's got to be around here somewhere.
Waiting.
"Juicy Fruit".
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Next".
Close enough.
"Hell, the fall will probably kill you."
"Butch Cassidy and the Sunrise Kid".
Great scene.
Jumping off the cliff.
Did you try calling the cell?
Yeah.
It's on silent mode, or else I would have heard it.
Found it.
You scared the hell out of me.
- Sir.
- You lose something?
No, just escaped.
Gotcha.
Broken?
Does a baby change its own diapers?
Nay.
Does it burp and feed itself?
I don't think so.
It takes a lot of TLC to keep my children happy and... and fully functioning in the lab of Abby, or
"Labby," as I like to call it.
You're my favorite.
Labby?
You want results, you got 'em.
Yeah, I want 'em.
First.
Fingerprints.
There were a bajillion of them, all on Lance Corporal's Koran, his clothes, but none on his misbaha.
His what?
Misbaha.
Muslim prayer beads.
It's kind of like a rosary, but different.
- And?
- I ran all the fingerprints through AFIS, Interpol, the FBI.
Several worshiped at the same mosque, but there's nothing to connect any of them to this crime.
Right.
Go on.
Abdul's prayer rug and his boots tested positive for phosphorus, saltpeter, Semtex and C-4.
Explosives.
Yeah, which could mean one of two things.
Give 'em both to me.
He was serving in Iraq with FAST company a couple of weeks ago.
So if he was defusing and handling IED's, that would account for the traces of explosives.
Or?
Or...
he was handling them once he got back.
That would not be good.
Terrorism.
I cloned and mirrored
Bakr's hard drive from his laptop.
He recently visited three Jihadist websites.
It's training videos.
Suicide bomber's last statements.
Anti-American everything.
These sites are known hubs for al Qaeda communication.
Lance Corporal Bakr visited these?
Well, either him or someone that had access to his computer.
His father?
Good work.
Back to your babies.
Hey.
- Thought you checked phone records?
- I did.
Technically, Abdul never placed a call or sent a text.
He did, however, press 11 keys, before tossing his phone up on the roof.
He wanted us to find it.
Code.
Well, basic Marine letter substitution.
- Crude but very effective.
- And?
Well, he may have named his killer, Boss.
Hans Staiger.
Suspected ties to al Qaeda in Germany.
Known as the "Recruiter".
Attempted to buy off several customs officials in France last year.
Got away.
Where?
There's no record of Staiger coming into this country or anywhere else.
He could be here with false papers.
Find him.
We looked.
If he's here, he's way underground.
Dig deeper.
- Where?
- Mosque.
Bug it.
That's where this all started.
Getting a warrant.
Would be easier if Bakr just sent us a text message.
Not if he thought someone was monitoring or intercepting his cell transmissions.
Someone was following him, Tony.
"Three Days of the Condor"?
Based on the novel "Six Days of the Condor" by James Grady.
Hey, I got one for you two.
Find out who killed my Marine.
Nobody likes a know-it-all.
Gibbs does.
Warrant just came through.
Anyone else have a problem with this?
Bugging a place of worship?
Check.
One, two, three, four.
If this were a Catholic church or a doctor's office, we'd still be judge-hunting.
I agree.
It should not be so easy bugging a mosque.
Give it to me.
I'm going in.
You're a woman.
It'd be easier for me to blend in.
- Yes, you would blend right in.
- All right, then we'll flip for it.
If I flip you, you will get hurt.
You can take her, Probie.
Do it.
Compromise.
Tony will do it.
I don't want to do it.
That's impossible.
We haven't even planted a bug yet.
There's a transmission coming from inside the mosque.
It's already being bugged?
We tracked the signal back to the FBI frequency, Mr. Langer.
I checked and no warrant was issued to the FBI.
I can't confirm or deny if the mosque is under FBI observation.
This is a murder investigation.
Some interagency cooperation would be nice.
Anything we should know?
Not that I can tell you.
That's crap.
We both know that you can say anything you want to.
Did I come at a bad time?
Jethro.
- How are you?
- How'd they let you in here, newbie?
Man, it's been a long time.
You two know each other.
How nice.
Taught him everything he's forgotten.
I thought you retired.
I tried.
You look good, old man.
Hey, listen, sorry about our inconvenient convergence here.
Our what?
Gibbs used to fine me for every three-dollar word I used.
How much?
- Three dollars a word.
- You owe me six.
See.
Marines.
No, actually, I started here.
Gibbs took me under his wing and then proceed to crush me.
Nothing you didn't deserve.
Left me no choice but to crawl over to the FBI.
Yeah, and they actually hired you.
Yeah, can you believe that?
Well, now maybe the NCIS and the FBI can cooperate on this investigation?
We may be observing the mosque.
Well, that's a little vague.
I can't tell you any more than that, Jethro.
You know that.
Okay.
Well, I hope we don't get in each other's way.
Well, now if you guys find anything out then...
You'll be the last to know.
Hey, come on.
Excuse me, Director.
Jethro, I think I have it.
Have what?
A way to find the cause of Lance Corporal Bakr's death.
You're going to do that autopsy?
No.
Well, yes.
Well, in, in a manner of speaking.
But a lot of people are going to have to look the other way.
Starting with you, Director.
Lost?
Actually, I was looking for Agent Gibbs.
He was just... just... upstairs a minute ago.
Can I help you?
Yeah.
You...
Maybe you could give him my card and ask him to call me.
I'm Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.
I'm in charge here.
Well, hey, I'm Special Agent Brent Langer FBI.
You know that's weird.
I could've sworn that Agent Gibbs said he was in charge.
He is.
Well, yeah, he's in charge when he's here, but when he's not here, I'm in charge.
I'm in charge.
Well, I'll just call him later.
But thanks anyway.
What an ass.
Yes, indeed.
You're Langer-leering.
You're leering at Langer.
What if I am, Tony?
He's cute.
- "Cute".
He's not cute.
He's like...
- Don't speak.
"Bullets Over Broadway".
Woody Allen.
Very good.
You'd get a "B" in my class.
- I could teach your class.
- Yeah, right.
Officer David.
I'm going to need you to come down to the evidence garage, and I need you to bring someone with you.
The key here, Jethro, is discretion.
We're not going through official channels, Mr. Palmer.
Official channels take time.
That's the one thing we don't have.
Muslims desire their dead to be buried within 24 hours.
That leaves us 13.
- Doctor.
- Doctor.
You have 20 minutes.
A minute longer, you'll get found out and I'll get fired.
Clear?
How do I repay you?
I just repaid you.
We're even now.
Something wrong, Mr. Palmer?
If this weren't a Muslim family, we wouldn't be here.
That is correct.
I don't think anyone should get special treatment.
We're risking our careers by doing this.
You can always leave.
- Doctor, I wasn't with you in Bosnia.
- True.
And I certainly wasn't on the Crusades.
But 9/11.
The Intifada.
Hamas.
You have a problem with Muslims, Mr. Palmer?
No.
No, I do not.
But it seems like they have a problem with us.
Religions have been the basis of conflict for generations.
- So we just live with this?
- Until we learn to respect one another.
All right, Mr. Palmer, let's follow the path of the bullet.
The resolution's astonishing.
Yes, and magnification...
You can actually almost see as well as a traditional autopsy.
Angle of the trajectory indicates the bullet traveled through the first intercostal space avoiding the heart and bronchial branch of the lungs.
Missed all vital organs.
Went to the third intercostal space and exited the back.
Hold your horses.
There seems to be a bullet fragment chipped off the eighth rib and then disappeared.
There's no other exit wounds.
Is the fragment still in his body?
Density's becoming an issue.
We're seeing too much bone and not enough soft tissue.
MRI?
Excellent idea.
Tea?
You shouldn't have, but thank you.
Well, if you change your mind.
You're an Israeli Jew, no?
Yes.
I used to take my family to Haifa.
I spent my summers in Haifa.
No, just push it to one side.
You make it Arab style?
Strong.
I like strong.
You like Muslims?
Yes.
May I ask why?
I mean, I don't wish to offend you.
I'm just curious.
When you grow up in Israel, most of your neighbors are Muslim.
My best friend was Muslim Arab.
He was a young boy.
We were very close.
Are you still close?
No.
He was killed when I was 12.
By an Israeli missile strike on a hotel.
There has been too much death.
I agree.
Come on now.
Show us this bullet fragment.
What is it, Mr. Palmer?
It's moving.
His neck.
Is that a bullet fragment?
No, bullets are lead.
They're non-magnetic.
Turn off the power.
What is it?
This, my dear Officer David, is what you call an unexpected turn of events.
Abby.
Yay!
It worked.
- What?
- My Gibbs early warning alarm system.
The Arabs used to put dried brush outside their tents to alert them in case there was an intruder.
So I just updated it to bubble wrap.
You called me.
I know.
It was a test.
You want to know what I found.
Trippy.
I like it.
I was able to extract an undiluted sample from inside the needle shaft.
And voilà, I give you the blue-ringed octopus.
A what?
It produces a toxin that's a hundred times more deadly than cobra venom.
It's the most deadly natural neurotoxin on the planet, and it's impossible to trace in the bloodstream.
You did.
Well, because it wasn't in the bloodstream.
It was still inside the needle shaft Ducky found, perfectly preserved and pure.
He walked a long way.
Because the needle snapped off during insertion.
It was a result of oxidation and age, so that resulted in metal fatigue.
Lance Corporal Bakr, he only got a partial dose.
That's why he could walk for two blocks.
- Yeah, but it killed him.
- Yeah... or the bullet.
I mean, it's hard to say.
I'm running the toxicology now.
Aren't you gonna ask me?
What?
Why the needle was affected by magnetic force.
I mean, they make these out of 440 carbon.
It's a non-magnetic steel.
Why?
Because...
the needle was really old.
It was, like, from the '70s.
Not that that's...
That's not old.
I mean, well, it's old for a needle, sure, but it's certainly not old for, you know, a man.
Where?
There's two companies in the United States that handle the toxin.
They use it for research on antivenoms.
- They're both in the DC area.
- Names?
- Morgan Industries and Bio-Tonics.
- Have an e-mail sent...
I already e-mailed it to McGee and Tony.
You're my favorite.
Abs...
Lose the bubble wrap.
Go, McGoo.
Morgan Industries is clean.
Got it.
Probie's over at Morgan Industries.
They show no missing venom.
Can I help you?
Yes, we need to check your records.
You see?
Every drop accounted for.
- There's none missing from inventory.
- Check again.
I've checked four times.
I'm telling you, we watch this stuff.
Here you go.
Okay.
"Paycheck".
- Ben Affleck, Uma Thurman?
- That's right.
Ben plays the bad guy, does dirty work for this company and then they erase his memory.
Beats the bad guys by mailing clues to himself.
We are going to need all your shipping manifests.
Originals.
Everything that's been sent out of here in the last six months.
McGee can go back and do the same at Morgan Industries.
That's a lot of inventory to check.
We got time.
Okay.
Hey!
Where are you going, Jackrabbit?
I'm going to paradise.
- Where are you going?
- To the parking lot.
Put your butt in the back of our car.
Go.
Hacked into Bio-Tonics worldwide tracking software.
We followed a shipment of the neurotoxin from Bio-Tonics to Stanford University, except the university never received the shipment.
But as you can see, Bio-Tonics tracking shows that the venom was ordered and delivered.
- Who signed for it?
- Nobody.
It never got there.
It turns out that the university never even ordered the neurotoxin, so there was nothing missing from the warehouse.
Enabling them to walk out the front door with it.
- Who?
- Ryan Sikes, shipping clerk.
Thinks he's a jackrabbit.
And an ex-con.
Did time for armed robbery, computer crimes, other assorted tidbits.
In prison, he converted to Islam.
- Get him.
- Got him.
Good.
There is only one God and He is great.
That's good to know.
Why'd you kill Corporal Bakr?
Why has this country killed a hundred thousand Iraqi civilians and 30,000 sick children after they invaded the first time?
Corporal Bakr was a Muslim.
You're a Muslim.
Killing him, that's a sin.
How many civilians have the Marines killed on Muslim soil?
I'm talking about a Marine on American soil.
Ryan.
Ryan is my slave name.
My real name is Akbur
Mohammed.
Your slave name?
Yes.
You want a statement?
Death to America.
You want a confession?
I did it.
I killed that turncoat bastard.
He turned against his own people...
Hey, what are you...?
!
He didn't even look.
Gibbs doesn't need to.
Get in here!
Were you gonna tell me about this?
The ankle bracelet was a condition of his parole.
We have requested the tracking records from the parole office.
Be able to put him in the alley at exactly the time Abdul was killed.
I already confessed.
Now, I killed him.
Boss?
Bad news.
Just got the tracking records back.
GPS records show that Sikes was 20 miles away from the crime scene at the time of the murder.
He's got an airtight alibi, the US government.
Waiting on you, newbie.
Are you still working on this damn boat?
Finished it twice.
This is number three.
And still drinking the same beer.
So, yes, we think the mosque is a recruitment center for al Qaeda.
The cell in DC?
No.
Al Qaeda's changed their business model.
We think they're paying people now, cash, to Muslims and non-Muslims, US citizens.
Capitalist jihad.
Smart.
More like dangerous.
We're pretty good at monitoring radicalized citizens, but, now, anyone with a need or greed might be playing on their team, who knows.
- You think our murder is connected?
- Possible.
The dead Marine's father, he's on our watch list.
Why?
Everything we've got is on this, and it's not much.
To be perfectly honest with you, I'm not even sure why we're investigating.
Homeland is working on something, but it's so compartmentalized, no one's sharing.
MP3 files.
Last six months of recordings from inside the mosque.
- Thanks.
- Don't thank me.
I was never here.
You ever consider using power tools?
You are still a pain in the ass.
I learned from the best.
Catch you later, Boss.
Khalid is asking for some money to be made as a donation to the mosque.
This other man is speaking Arabic, but it is not his first language.
Think he could be German.
What's he saying?
Khalid is accepting cash paid through an offshore account.
Running the voices through Interpol, FBI and databases.
Start with Hans Staiger.
Positive ID, boss, it's Staiger.
Suspected al Qaeda recruiter.
Wanted in four countries.
No face, no prints, just calls intercepted over the last year.
We don't know who he is, just that he is.
And that he's talking to Khalid.
You're okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
The funeral home is sending a car.
- Thank you, again.
- Thank you.
Your son was a great credit to his country and his culture.
Jethro, he family has requested his personal effects to be returned.
Anything you want to tell me?
About?
Anything.
- Why do you hate us?
- I don't.
Your people do.
All we ask for, is to live in peace and observe our beliefs.
I think you are.
Islam came to your country with hostility in 2001, and that was wrong.
But you came to our land 500 years ago and you've never left.
All we wish for, is to be left alone to practice our ways, and yet you cannot leave us alone.
Why?
Why did the recruiter kill your son, because he said "no"
or because he said "yes"?
There is a man.
- A German.
- Hans Staiger.
He recruits for al Qaeda.
This recruiter approached my son.
Abdul was gathering information for the authorities.
A spy for his government.
I called the FBI.
I called them to investigate my own mosque.
I killed my own son.
No, you didn't.
But until we find who did, we need to keep his body a little longer.
Find this recruiter and allow me to have my vengeance.
Please.
He's mine.
The body stays, Duck.
I already released the body.
Well, un-release it.
I determined a cause of death.
The poison may have weakened his system, but it was the gunshot that killed him.
The body stays.
Until we find our killer.
- I have killed for less.
- You cheated.
- Did not.
- Yes, you did.
That is a book of movies.
I bet you never saw all those movies, you just read the book.
- I like books.
- I like movies.
Don't quote books, I will not quote movies.
What if it's a book that's been made into a movie?
Patterns.
George C. Scott, 1970, won seven Academy Awards,
- including Best Picture, boss.
- Patterns.
Patterns, not "Patton".
Patterns?
If this is al Qaeda, that means activity.
Activity means patterns.
Dead Marines who are Muslims.
Checking.
That's all we've got, two of them.
A Shiite Muslim stationed at Camp David.
Died of unknown causes two weeks ago.
Sergeant Major out of Norfolk, Sunni, died last week.
Both were stationed in Iraq, both had run-ins with the law.
- Both died of natural causes.
- They have something else in common.
- What?
- They're both dead.
No.
Something else.
- What?
- What?
Same personnel officer.
Look,
I'm a patriot.
I'm a volunteer reservist.
With money problems.
You're divorcing your wife, claimed you were broke in court, you oversee a lot of drug addicts, access to needles, access to Brian Sikes.
Which gave you access to the toxins used to kill three Marines.
We found $270,000 in your shed.
I guess your money problems are over.
What exactly are you charging me with?
A German named Hans Staiger was paying you to help recruit troubled Muslim Marines to serve for the other side.
Two of them obviously refused and are now dead.
I'm a parole officer,
I know how the system works.
Lawyer...
- right now.
- You killed a Marine yesterday.
- Shot him with his own gun.
- Why would I do that?
To make sure he was dead.
"Natural causes" didn't work as well for him as it did for the other two, so you followed him and you shot him.
Lawyer.
Boss.
Sorry.
Ducky needs you.
Now.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I was wrong.
- About what?
- The gunshot.
Abby's toxicology report.
Abdul was dead before he was shot.
Some of the poison did get into his system.
If your personnel officer did shoot him, he didn't kill him.
The most you could legally prove is that he desecrated a body.
If we don't have him for murder, he'll never give up the recruiter.
We just matched the slug from Abdul's body to your gun, not his.
- That's impossible.
- Yeah.
And a good lawyer could prove that, but you're not getting a lawyer.
You're getting a transfer to a Naval base in Cuba.
It's called Gitmo.
Ever heard of it?
Case closed.
I can give you Staiger.
He's the one who injected Corporal Bakr, and the other two Marines when they wouldn't cooperate.
He said it'd be quick.
The needle broke, so he followed him from the mosque, he shot him.
You just happened to be there?
I was the go-between.
You want more?
I want a civilian case, filed with the DA's Office, with the guarantee that I won't be prosecuted for terrorism.
Deal.
Staiger.
Bedford Hotel.
Room 126.
These belong to Abdul.
They were returned to his father.
Are you sure?
Gibbs, I...
No, nothing like them.
I didn't think so.
Allah, in his wisdom and greatness, has given us each a gift.
A gift that we must share with others.
Even if they do not wish to accept it.
It is our obligation to share Islam with non-believers.
So that we may save them from themselves.
My husband.
You were anxious to talk to him, weren't you?
That's a movie.
I'm starting to get over the idea...
Not just any movie.
That's "Double Identity".
Your power of observation is unearthly.
Now, leave me alone.
This is the best part.
I not gonna get between a chick and a flick.
How do you know it's the best part?
Because it is the third time I have seen it.
You don't even watch movies.
This is not a movie.
It's a classic film.
Yeah, I know that.
You don't know that.
Film studies?
Well...
I really appreciate that, Ziva.
Really, I do.
I am taking it because it is the best way to pick up American colloquialism, like "bug off."
You should watch "Fast Times at Ridgemont High".
I saw it last week.
Sean Penn is a genius.
Phoebe Cates is a babe.
Now, do you mind?
- I can get you a list...
- I have a list!
Bye.
Morning, Probie Pan.
Where'd you pick that up?
Neverland?
No, Pottery Den.
50% off.
Got six of them for ten dollars.
That's pretty big, don't you think?
Well, I don't like getting refills ten times a day.
Well, but I mean, that's a little...
A little what?
Seuss-ical?
Leave.
I'm enjoying my moment.
Am I the only normal one here?
No.
Morning, Boss.
Marine killed.
Let's go.
Shotgun.
Anacostia and 18th, not the battlefield he thought he'd die on.
Baghdad's safer than this neighborhood.
Hey.
What do we got?
Ring, watch, and wallet are missing.
Government issue.
Could be the murder weapon.
A Marine killed with his own gun?
Nearly 30% of all gun-related deaths are the results of the owner's own weapon.
Your first impressions, Mr. Palmer?
Well, there should be much more blood loss evident.
Based upon?
Based on the position of the body, even with the heart slightly elevated.
Precisely even with a gunshot that high in the thoracic cavity, one would expect more
- blood loss.
- Meaning?
Meaning I'm not going to say anything else until I've examined the body more closely.
The gurney, please, Mr. Palmer.
Right away, Doctor.
Good lad.
Good Marine.
Sunni.
- How do you know that?
- If he were a Shiite, he'd have a turba with him.
Like Hadji on "Johnny Quest".
No, I believe that's a turban, Tony.
A turba is a small stone tablet that the Shiites set their forehead on while praying.
The devout develop a callus.
Ziva.
Checking for local Sunni mosques.
McGee.
Checking all security cameras.
Got it.
There's a Sunni mosque two blocks east.
Show me.
She cannot come in here.
Women are not allowed.
I will wait outside.
Federal agents.
She's with me.
She is welcome here.
As you are.
I'm sure you understand traditions.
We do not wish to offend anyone.
I am Jewish.
I do understand tradition.
You... wish to ask me questions?
No.
Then, you wish to speak to every man who worships here under the age of 30.
No.
Then what?
We think this man may have attended your mosque.
And what has he done?
Nothing.
He is dead, killed two blocks from here.
Do you know him?
Stahf'Allah.
This is my son.
Your son have any enemies?
Yes.
Ignorance, intolerance, and hatred.
Any with a first name?
We would like your permission to look at Abdul's things.
I'll need to tell the family what has happened.
We will have someone drive you.
Thank you.
You wait here.
Please.
Come on.
Guy was with his son right before he died.
Suspect.
Victim.
Abdul Mohammed Bakr, age 23, Lance Corporal.
Served in First FAST Company.
Bronze Star and Purple Heart for service in Iraq.
Three tours, boss.
He kept going back.
If he stayed, he might still be alive.
Hypothetically, Boss.
- What else?
- Had some run-ins with the law.
- Arrests?
- Assault and battery, twice.
Here in DC, both cases were dismissed.
Maybe they gave him favorable treatment because he was serving in Iraq.
Find out.
Tracking down his personnel officer, Boss.
- Cameras.
- Yeah
I tapped into Metro traffic cameras and a few parking lot surveillance networks, stitched together Abdul's route from the alley back to the mosque.
There's no sign of anything until here.
Can't get a reading on the man's face, but he did go into the alley.
Back it up.
Stop.
Tighter his hands.
He was carrying a phone.
Forward.
Stop.
- Must have dumped it.
- McGee.
Already ran the phone records, Boss.
His cell didn't send or receive any calls that day.
- Find it.
- On it.
Probie, you start the search near the crime scene.
We'll meet you there later.
David, with me.
Captain's right down here.
I'm sorry, the correct answer is "Full Metal Jacket".
That was not the best Marine movie.
"A Few Good Men" was.
Based on the fact that I'm right, I'm overruling you.
If you're here to volunteer,
- we'll take you.
- I already have a job, Captain Mills.
NCIS.
We're here about a Marine.
Abdul Bakr.
You were his personnel officer.
Yeah,
First FAST Company.
He's in Iraq.
No, he's in our morgue.
He was murdered earlier today.
God.
- He's such a good kid.
- Well, we know he had some troubles.
A few fights, he never started 'em.
We would like to see his personnel records.
Sure, I'll...
I'll get you everything I got.
You coach?
Yeah, I'm a parole officer in civilian life.
- We have an after-school league.
- Civilian life?
I'm a reservist, recalled for active duty last year.
Manpower issues.
Iraq?
Iraq.
So, a parole officer and a personnel officer, that's kind of the same thing, isn't it?
Yeah, the Marine Corps likes to place reservists in similar lines of work.
Makes things run more efficiently.
So in your professional opinion, you think Lance Corporal Bakr's run-ins could have led to his murder?
Maybe someone he had a fight with came back?
Nobody stayed mad at him.
He was a good kid and a great Marine.
And a Muslim.
Yeah.
That's what the fights were about.
He stuck up for his people.
Hard to be a Muslim and a Marine.
Was he ever sympathetic to un-American activities?
No way.
Not this kid.
Ducky.
Just a moment, Jethro.
Is the needle in his femoral artery, Mr. Palmer?
Yes, Doctor.
Good.
Never seen a gunshot victim with so much blood left in his body.
Rare but not unheard of.
And if the bullet pierced his heart, it would have stopped pumping instantly.
And of course the pressure of the boards on his back may have prevented gravitational loss.
Right, that should do it.
Take those up to Abby.
Get her to run the usual tox screen.
Right away.
Neatly done, Mr. Palmer.
Thank you, Doctor.
That young man will make a first class medical examiner one of these days.
Today?
Yeah, well, until I open him up, I can't say for sure.
But all indications are that he was killed by the gunshot wound.
There are no defensive wounds, no lacerations, no abrasions, no contusions.
And unless I find intradermal bruising, no signs of a struggle.
A Marine with combat experience let someone take his weapon away from him without a fight?
Well, I only tell you what the body tells me.
Ask different questions, Duck.
I will, Jethro.
I assure you.
Yes, well, the first question is, what damage did that bullet exactly do?
Ducky, wait...
Need to talk to you.
Mr. Bakr has something to say.
Dr. Mallard, please don't cut into him.
I beg you to respect our religion.
So my son can find peace in heaven.
With all due respect, we have to.
I beg of you, please don't do this.
Sorry, there's no choice.
There is a choice, Jethro.
Mine.
I can't do this autopsy.
So what are you saying exactly?
That we have an obligation to honor faith as well as science, and in this case, the wishes of the family.
We cannot waive an autopsy in the middle of a murder investigation.
- Why not?
- Because the laws are very specific.
We can try to accommodate some aspect of tradition or religious ceremony, but we can't forfeit the most critical aspect of the investigation.
Abdul Bakr was a Marine who died as a hero.
That young man risked his life for this country.
The least we can do is to respect him in death.
He didn't die in Iraq, Ducky.
Well, but that's not the point!
What is the point, Duck?
This country was founded on freedom, religious freedom.
That family came here to practice it, and I can't ignore a basic tenet of their beliefs:
that if I cut open the body, that will prevent their son from finding peace in heaven.
There is no greater sin.
What about murder?
We need to find a cause of death.
We need to find evidence.
You need to do the autopsy.
That's it.
All right, I'll do it.
Under protest.
I have another body to examine.
So this will have to wait.
Why?
I already told you why.
Why?
This case brings back memories of a mass grave.
I was a volunteer medical examiner for a UN task force in Bosnia in '93.
I did 44 autopsies in five days, most of them children under 12, all Muslims.
The village was targeted because of who they were or who they weren't.
Nothing more.
Selected for their ethnicity.
The parents begged me not to autopsy their children.
Begged me on their knees.
But I had no choice.
I suppose I still don't.
I'll give you my report when I'm done.
His phone's got to be around here somewhere.
Waiting.
"Juicy Fruit".
"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Next".
Close enough.
"Hell, the fall will probably kill you."
"Butch Cassidy and the Sunrise Kid".
Great scene.
Jumping off the cliff.
Did you try calling the cell?
Yeah.
It's on silent mode, or else I would have heard it.
Found it.
You scared the hell out of me.
- Sir.
- You lose something?
No, just escaped.
Gotcha.
Broken?
Does a baby change its own diapers?
Nay.
Does it burp and feed itself?
I don't think so.
It takes a lot of TLC to keep my children happy and... and fully functioning in the lab of Abby, or
"Labby," as I like to call it.
You're my favorite.
Labby?
You want results, you got 'em.
Yeah, I want 'em.
First.
Fingerprints.
There were a bajillion of them, all on Lance Corporal's Koran, his clothes, but none on his misbaha.
His what?
Misbaha.
Muslim prayer beads.
It's kind of like a rosary, but different.
- And?
- I ran all the fingerprints through AFIS, Interpol, the FBI.
Several worshiped at the same mosque, but there's nothing to connect any of them to this crime.
Right.
Go on.
Abdul's prayer rug and his boots tested positive for phosphorus, saltpeter, Semtex and C-4.
Explosives.
Yeah, which could mean one of two things.
Give 'em both to me.
He was serving in Iraq with FAST company a couple of weeks ago.
So if he was defusing and handling IED's, that would account for the traces of explosives.
Or?
Or...
he was handling them once he got back.
That would not be good.
Terrorism.
I cloned and mirrored
Bakr's hard drive from his laptop.
He recently visited three Jihadist websites.
It's training videos.
Suicide bomber's last statements.
Anti-American everything.
These sites are known hubs for al Qaeda communication.
Lance Corporal Bakr visited these?
Well, either him or someone that had access to his computer.
His father?
Good work.
Back to your babies.
Hey.
- Thought you checked phone records?
- I did.
Technically, Abdul never placed a call or sent a text.
He did, however, press 11 keys, before tossing his phone up on the roof.
He wanted us to find it.
Code.
Well, basic Marine letter substitution.
- Crude but very effective.
- And?
Well, he may have named his killer, Boss.
Hans Staiger.
Suspected ties to al Qaeda in Germany.
Known as the "Recruiter".
Attempted to buy off several customs officials in France last year.
Got away.
Where?
There's no record of Staiger coming into this country or anywhere else.
He could be here with false papers.
Find him.
We looked.
If he's here, he's way underground.
Dig deeper.
- Where?
- Mosque.
Bug it.
That's where this all started.
Getting a warrant.
Would be easier if Bakr just sent us a text message.
Not if he thought someone was monitoring or intercepting his cell transmissions.
Someone was following him, Tony.
"Three Days of the Condor"?
Based on the novel "Six Days of the Condor" by James Grady.
Hey, I got one for you two.
Find out who killed my Marine.
Nobody likes a know-it-all.
Gibbs does.
Warrant just came through.
Anyone else have a problem with this?
Bugging a place of worship?
Check.
One, two, three, four.
If this were a Catholic church or a doctor's office, we'd still be judge-hunting.
I agree.
It should not be so easy bugging a mosque.
Give it to me.
I'm going in.
You're a woman.
It'd be easier for me to blend in.
- Yes, you would blend right in.
- All right, then we'll flip for it.
If I flip you, you will get hurt.
You can take her, Probie.
Do it.
Compromise.
Tony will do it.
I don't want to do it.
That's impossible.
We haven't even planted a bug yet.
There's a transmission coming from inside the mosque.
It's already being bugged?
We tracked the signal back to the FBI frequency, Mr. Langer.
I checked and no warrant was issued to the FBI.
I can't confirm or deny if the mosque is under FBI observation.
This is a murder investigation.
Some interagency cooperation would be nice.
Anything we should know?
Not that I can tell you.
That's crap.
We both know that you can say anything you want to.
Did I come at a bad time?
Jethro.
- How are you?
- How'd they let you in here, newbie?
Man, it's been a long time.
You two know each other.
How nice.
Taught him everything he's forgotten.
I thought you retired.
I tried.
You look good, old man.
Hey, listen, sorry about our inconvenient convergence here.
Our what?
Gibbs used to fine me for every three-dollar word I used.
How much?
- Three dollars a word.
- You owe me six.
See.
Marines.
No, actually, I started here.
Gibbs took me under his wing and then proceed to crush me.
Nothing you didn't deserve.
Left me no choice but to crawl over to the FBI.
Yeah, and they actually hired you.
Yeah, can you believe that?
Well, now maybe the NCIS and the FBI can cooperate on this investigation?
We may be observing the mosque.
Well, that's a little vague.
I can't tell you any more than that, Jethro.
You know that.
Okay.
Well, I hope we don't get in each other's way.
Well, now if you guys find anything out then...
You'll be the last to know.
Hey, come on.
Excuse me, Director.
Jethro, I think I have it.
Have what?
A way to find the cause of Lance Corporal Bakr's death.
You're going to do that autopsy?
No.
Well, yes.
Well, in, in a manner of speaking.
But a lot of people are going to have to look the other way.
Starting with you, Director.
Lost?
Actually, I was looking for Agent Gibbs.
He was just... just... upstairs a minute ago.
Can I help you?
Yeah.
You...
Maybe you could give him my card and ask him to call me.
I'm Special Agent Anthony DiNozzo.
I'm in charge here.
Well, hey, I'm Special Agent Brent Langer FBI.
You know that's weird.
I could've sworn that Agent Gibbs said he was in charge.
He is.
Well, yeah, he's in charge when he's here, but when he's not here, I'm in charge.
I'm in charge.
Well, I'll just call him later.
But thanks anyway.
What an ass.
Yes, indeed.
You're Langer-leering.
You're leering at Langer.
What if I am, Tony?
He's cute.
- "Cute".
He's not cute.
He's like...
- Don't speak.
"Bullets Over Broadway".
Woody Allen.
Very good.
You'd get a "B" in my class.
- I could teach your class.
- Yeah, right.
Officer David.
I'm going to need you to come down to the evidence garage, and I need you to bring someone with you.
The key here, Jethro, is discretion.
We're not going through official channels, Mr. Palmer.
Official channels take time.
That's the one thing we don't have.
Muslims desire their dead to be buried within 24 hours.
That leaves us 13.
- Doctor.
- Doctor.
You have 20 minutes.
A minute longer, you'll get found out and I'll get fired.
Clear?
How do I repay you?
I just repaid you.
We're even now.
Something wrong, Mr. Palmer?
If this weren't a Muslim family, we wouldn't be here.
That is correct.
I don't think anyone should get special treatment.
We're risking our careers by doing this.
You can always leave.
- Doctor, I wasn't with you in Bosnia.
- True.
And I certainly wasn't on the Crusades.
But 9/11.
The Intifada.
Hamas.
You have a problem with Muslims, Mr. Palmer?
No.
No, I do not.
But it seems like they have a problem with us.
Religions have been the basis of conflict for generations.
- So we just live with this?
- Until we learn to respect one another.
All right, Mr. Palmer, let's follow the path of the bullet.
The resolution's astonishing.
Yes, and magnification...
You can actually almost see as well as a traditional autopsy.
Angle of the trajectory indicates the bullet traveled through the first intercostal space avoiding the heart and bronchial branch of the lungs.
Missed all vital organs.
Went to the third intercostal space and exited the back.
Hold your horses.
There seems to be a bullet fragment chipped off the eighth rib and then disappeared.
There's no other exit wounds.
Is the fragment still in his body?
Density's becoming an issue.
We're seeing too much bone and not enough soft tissue.
MRI?
Excellent idea.
Tea?
You shouldn't have, but thank you.
Well, if you change your mind.
You're an Israeli Jew, no?
Yes.
I used to take my family to Haifa.
I spent my summers in Haifa.
No, just push it to one side.
You make it Arab style?
Strong.
I like strong.
You like Muslims?
Yes.
May I ask why?
I mean, I don't wish to offend you.
I'm just curious.
When you grow up in Israel, most of your neighbors are Muslim.
My best friend was Muslim Arab.
He was a young boy.
We were very close.
Are you still close?
No.
He was killed when I was 12.
By an Israeli missile strike on a hotel.
There has been too much death.
I agree.
Come on now.
Show us this bullet fragment.
What is it, Mr. Palmer?
It's moving.
His neck.
Is that a bullet fragment?
No, bullets are lead.
They're non-magnetic.
Turn off the power.
What is it?
This, my dear Officer David, is what you call an unexpected turn of events.
Abby.
Yay!
It worked.
- What?
- My Gibbs early warning alarm system.
The Arabs used to put dried brush outside their tents to alert them in case there was an intruder.
So I just updated it to bubble wrap.
You called me.
I know.
It was a test.
You want to know what I found.
Trippy.
I like it.
I was able to extract an undiluted sample from inside the needle shaft.
And voilà, I give you the blue-ringed octopus.
A what?
It produces a toxin that's a hundred times more deadly than cobra venom.
It's the most deadly natural neurotoxin on the planet, and it's impossible to trace in the bloodstream.
You did.
Well, because it wasn't in the bloodstream.
It was still inside the needle shaft Ducky found, perfectly preserved and pure.
He walked a long way.
Because the needle snapped off during insertion.
It was a result of oxidation and age, so that resulted in metal fatigue.
Lance Corporal Bakr, he only got a partial dose.
That's why he could walk for two blocks.
- Yeah, but it killed him.
- Yeah... or the bullet.
I mean, it's hard to say.
I'm running the toxicology now.
Aren't you gonna ask me?
What?
Why the needle was affected by magnetic force.
I mean, they make these out of 440 carbon.
It's a non-magnetic steel.
Why?
Because...
the needle was really old.
It was, like, from the '70s.
Not that that's...
That's not old.
I mean, well, it's old for a needle, sure, but it's certainly not old for, you know, a man.
Where?
There's two companies in the United States that handle the toxin.
They use it for research on antivenoms.
- They're both in the DC area.
- Names?
- Morgan Industries and Bio-Tonics.
- Have an e-mail sent...
I already e-mailed it to McGee and Tony.
You're my favorite.
Abs...
Lose the bubble wrap.
Go, McGoo.
Morgan Industries is clean.
Got it.
Probie's over at Morgan Industries.
They show no missing venom.
Can I help you?
Yes, we need to check your records.
You see?
Every drop accounted for.
- There's none missing from inventory.
- Check again.
I've checked four times.
I'm telling you, we watch this stuff.
Here you go.
Okay.
"Paycheck".
- Ben Affleck, Uma Thurman?
- That's right.
Ben plays the bad guy, does dirty work for this company and then they erase his memory.
Beats the bad guys by mailing clues to himself.
We are going to need all your shipping manifests.
Originals.
Everything that's been sent out of here in the last six months.
McGee can go back and do the same at Morgan Industries.
That's a lot of inventory to check.
We got time.
Okay.
Hey!
Where are you going, Jackrabbit?
I'm going to paradise.
- Where are you going?
- To the parking lot.
Put your butt in the back of our car.
Go.
Hacked into Bio-Tonics worldwide tracking software.
We followed a shipment of the neurotoxin from Bio-Tonics to Stanford University, except the university never received the shipment.
But as you can see, Bio-Tonics tracking shows that the venom was ordered and delivered.
- Who signed for it?
- Nobody.
It never got there.
It turns out that the university never even ordered the neurotoxin, so there was nothing missing from the warehouse.
Enabling them to walk out the front door with it.
- Who?
- Ryan Sikes, shipping clerk.
Thinks he's a jackrabbit.
And an ex-con.
Did time for armed robbery, computer crimes, other assorted tidbits.
In prison, he converted to Islam.
- Get him.
- Got him.
Good.
There is only one God and He is great.
That's good to know.
Why'd you kill Corporal Bakr?
Why has this country killed a hundred thousand Iraqi civilians and 30,000 sick children after they invaded the first time?
Corporal Bakr was a Muslim.
You're a Muslim.
Killing him, that's a sin.
How many civilians have the Marines killed on Muslim soil?
I'm talking about a Marine on American soil.
Ryan.
Ryan is my slave name.
My real name is Akbur
Mohammed.
Your slave name?
Yes.
You want a statement?
Death to America.
You want a confession?
I did it.
I killed that turncoat bastard.
He turned against his own people...
Hey, what are you...?
!
He didn't even look.
Gibbs doesn't need to.
Get in here!
Were you gonna tell me about this?
The ankle bracelet was a condition of his parole.
We have requested the tracking records from the parole office.
Be able to put him in the alley at exactly the time Abdul was killed.
I already confessed.
Now, I killed him.
Boss?
Bad news.
Just got the tracking records back.
GPS records show that Sikes was 20 miles away from the crime scene at the time of the murder.
He's got an airtight alibi, the US government.
Waiting on you, newbie.
Are you still working on this damn boat?
Finished it twice.
This is number three.
And still drinking the same beer.
So, yes, we think the mosque is a recruitment center for al Qaeda.
The cell in DC?
No.
Al Qaeda's changed their business model.
We think they're paying people now, cash, to Muslims and non-Muslims, US citizens.
Capitalist jihad.
Smart.
More like dangerous.
We're pretty good at monitoring radicalized citizens, but, now, anyone with a need or greed might be playing on their team, who knows.
- You think our murder is connected?
- Possible.
The dead Marine's father, he's on our watch list.
Why?
Everything we've got is on this, and it's not much.
To be perfectly honest with you, I'm not even sure why we're investigating.
Homeland is working on something, but it's so compartmentalized, no one's sharing.
MP3 files.
Last six months of recordings from inside the mosque.
- Thanks.
- Don't thank me.
I was never here.
You ever consider using power tools?
You are still a pain in the ass.
I learned from the best.
Catch you later, Boss.
Khalid is asking for some money to be made as a donation to the mosque.
This other man is speaking Arabic, but it is not his first language.
Think he could be German.
What's he saying?
Khalid is accepting cash paid through an offshore account.
Running the voices through Interpol, FBI and databases.
Start with Hans Staiger.
Positive ID, boss, it's Staiger.
Suspected al Qaeda recruiter.
Wanted in four countries.
No face, no prints, just calls intercepted over the last year.
We don't know who he is, just that he is.
And that he's talking to Khalid.
You're okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
The funeral home is sending a car.
- Thank you, again.
- Thank you.
Your son was a great credit to his country and his culture.
Jethro, he family has requested his personal effects to be returned.
Anything you want to tell me?
About?
Anything.
- Why do you hate us?
- I don't.
Your people do.
All we ask for, is to live in peace and observe our beliefs.
I think you are.
Islam came to your country with hostility in 2001, and that was wrong.
But you came to our land 500 years ago and you've never left.
All we wish for, is to be left alone to practice our ways, and yet you cannot leave us alone.
Why?
Why did the recruiter kill your son, because he said "no"
or because he said "yes"?
There is a man.
- A German.
- Hans Staiger.
He recruits for al Qaeda.
This recruiter approached my son.
Abdul was gathering information for the authorities.
A spy for his government.
I called the FBI.
I called them to investigate my own mosque.
I killed my own son.
No, you didn't.
But until we find who did, we need to keep his body a little longer.
Find this recruiter and allow me to have my vengeance.
Please.
He's mine.
The body stays, Duck.
I already released the body.
Well, un-release it.
I determined a cause of death.
The poison may have weakened his system, but it was the gunshot that killed him.
The body stays.
Until we find our killer.
- I have killed for less.
- You cheated.
- Did not.
- Yes, you did.
That is a book of movies.
I bet you never saw all those movies, you just read the book.
- I like books.
- I like movies.
Don't quote books, I will not quote movies.
What if it's a book that's been made into a movie?
Patterns.
George C. Scott, 1970, won seven Academy Awards,
- including Best Picture, boss.
- Patterns.
Patterns, not "Patton".
Patterns?
If this is al Qaeda, that means activity.
Activity means patterns.
Dead Marines who are Muslims.
Checking.
That's all we've got, two of them.
A Shiite Muslim stationed at Camp David.
Died of unknown causes two weeks ago.
Sergeant Major out of Norfolk, Sunni, died last week.
Both were stationed in Iraq, both had run-ins with the law.
- Both died of natural causes.
- They have something else in common.
- What?
- They're both dead.
No.
Something else.
- What?
- What?
Same personnel officer.
Look,
I'm a patriot.
I'm a volunteer reservist.
With money problems.
You're divorcing your wife, claimed you were broke in court, you oversee a lot of drug addicts, access to needles, access to Brian Sikes.
Which gave you access to the toxins used to kill three Marines.
We found $270,000 in your shed.
I guess your money problems are over.
What exactly are you charging me with?
A German named Hans Staiger was paying you to help recruit troubled Muslim Marines to serve for the other side.
Two of them obviously refused and are now dead.
I'm a parole officer,
I know how the system works.
Lawyer...
- right now.
- You killed a Marine yesterday.
- Shot him with his own gun.
- Why would I do that?
To make sure he was dead.
"Natural causes" didn't work as well for him as it did for the other two, so you followed him and you shot him.
Lawyer.
Boss.
Sorry.
Ducky needs you.
Now.
Sorry.
Sorry.
I was wrong.
- About what?
- The gunshot.
Abby's toxicology report.
Abdul was dead before he was shot.
Some of the poison did get into his system.
If your personnel officer did shoot him, he didn't kill him.
The most you could legally prove is that he desecrated a body.
If we don't have him for murder, he'll never give up the recruiter.
We just matched the slug from Abdul's body to your gun, not his.
- That's impossible.
- Yeah.
And a good lawyer could prove that, but you're not getting a lawyer.
You're getting a transfer to a Naval base in Cuba.
It's called Gitmo.
Ever heard of it?
Case closed.
I can give you Staiger.
He's the one who injected Corporal Bakr, and the other two Marines when they wouldn't cooperate.
He said it'd be quick.
The needle broke, so he followed him from the mosque, he shot him.
You just happened to be there?
I was the go-between.
You want more?
I want a civilian case, filed with the DA's Office, with the guarantee that I won't be prosecuted for terrorism.
Deal.
Staiger.
Bedford Hotel.
Room 126.
These belong to Abdul.
They were returned to his father.
Are you sure?
Gibbs, I...
No, nothing like them.
I didn't think so.
Hello?
Hello?
Stan?
Nesta?
Thank you.
Well, it's blood, alright.
Whether it's human is another matter.
- And this is how it was found?
- Yeah, same as the other cottage
Breakfast on the table, tea still warm.
Kettle on the hob.
No sign of the occupants.
If that is not human blood, George, what is it?
Four people live in these cottages and no sign of any of them.
I'll get the lab to run a check.
And the postman called us in?
- Noticed the blood stain, apparently.
- Yeah, where is he?
On his rounds, as far as we know.
That big house we passed on the way here.
- The priory?
- Yeah.
See if there's anyone in.
So, George.
In this cottage we got Nesta and Stanley Goodfellow.
What about the other?
The Thomases.
Molly and Colin.
Did you know them?
I did the post mortem on their 10-year-old son Peter.
He ran away from home after an argument.
Found wandering in Monksbarton Woods for a couple of days.
He was alive when they found him but he died soon after.
Suspicious death?
No, no, no.
He died of hypothermia.
When they found Peter, he was jibbering.
No one could understand him.
The locals had it that he was speaking in tongues.
Isn't there some kind of mystery surrounding Monksbarton Woods?
Well, I don't know any details, Tom.
The man you want's Wallace Stone, local historian.
He's the vicar over at Beau Clayton.
Bit of a hellfire and damnation man, too.
Water stains?
It could be.
Dunno.
Ask Forensics to pay us a visit.
I made some enquiries, though.
It's owned by a Lynton Pargeter.
He lives in London, but the place has been in the family for as long as anyone can remember.
Who lives there now?
He does.
Last of the Pargeters.
It's a big place for a weekend retreat, isn't it?
- Not if you're rich.
- Is he?
Well, I looked through the window, the place is stuffed with antiques.
Right.
Check his details.
Give him a ring.
You drive.
Drop me off at Beau Clayton vicarage.
I want to talk to a Reverend Stone.
Monksbarton Woods... er...
haunted, apparently.
By what?
The ghosts of monks, Mr Barnaby.
Men of the cloth who died violent deaths.
There was once a thriving religious community in Monksbarton.
The abbey was destroyed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries.
And the priory is all that's left?
When the soldiers arrived, the monks fled into the woods... they were hunted down and slaughtered.
Local legend says their death cries can sometimes still be heard.
This village is obsessed by Monksbarton legends.
We're plagued by ghost hunters, fanatics and freaks.
Half the village is among them.
I'm a man of God, Mr Barbaby.
There's no place for superstition in my religion.
Sarah!
Could you tell me, please, about Peter Thomas.
The boy had a silly argument with his mother, ran away, got lost.
Died of exposure.
Sarah!
It was said that when he was found he was... erm...
Speaking in tongues, yes.
Utter nonsense.
And near blasphemous nonsense at that.
I preached a sermon against it.
Did you press my jacket?
Why was he not found sooner?
The woods must've been his playground.
No, Colin and Molly Thomas lived all their lives here in Beau Clayton.
They only moved to Monksbarton after Peter died.
Molly got the idea that she'd be nearer to her dead son's spirit up there.
She thought she might be able to get in touch, ask for forgiveness.
She had a breakdown.
She wasn't in her right mind.
Country people, Mr Barnaby.
Simple minds can be easily ensnared... by the talk of ghosts and ghouls and the walking dead.
Frankly, I'd have preferred a city parish, but it seems...
I'm not thought suitable.
Odd, don't you think?
To be spurned for the strength of one's belief?
Did Molly Thomas come to you for help?
No, she spoke to my wife, for all the good it did.
Did you think that Mrs Thomas was unbalanced?
Mrs Stone?
She was a woman in grief.
What do you know about Monksbarton?
Monksbarton.
Apart from the two cottages it's just the priory now.
With Stanley Goodfellow and his wife to look after it.
Colin and Molly Thomas?
Colin's the manager of Benyon's Woodyard in Beau Clayton.
After Peter died, Molly insisted they move up to Monksbarton.
Did you know them?
I was part of the investigation into the boy's death.
Molly was in a bad way.
So the Goodfellows are...
what, caretakers?
They manage the priory and the woodland that surrounds it.
Stanley Goodfellow used to be a gamekeeper up on the Farley estate.
So, a normal couple.
Nesta was know to be a bit of a goer.
They say she had a couple of affairs.
You know... just the usual.
Hello.
Yes.
Just a moment.
- Can we pick this up later?
- Okay.
Drink after work?
Yeah, great.
Mr Pargeter...
Pargeter's on his way here?
He is.
Keys to the priory, just where he said they'd be.
Where's the post?
Postman called this morning.
Where's the post?
Got scared and forgot to leave it?
We'll ask him.
I'll check for return post.
Nice telly!
Plasma screen...
Every moment of footballing magic in high definition.
- It's expensive?
- 15-hundred?
Two grand?
Whew.
On a laborer's wage?
Forward!
Forward!
What?
You didn't hear it?
- It's a fox.
- Didn't sound like a fox to me.
Oh, all right.
It's the howl of a were-wolf, ravening for blood.
Lucky I'm here to protect you, then.
What's that?
Oh, that, Jones... is an iron maiden.
It's a medieval instrument of torture.
Ooh!
A slow lingering death in exquisite torment.
Different interrogation techniques in those days.
All right.
You take the rooms upstairs.
I'll look down here.
And make it quick.
Chop, chop!
You don't expect to find them?
Not unless they're all dead.
Ooh!
Yeah.
Jones?
Hello?
Jones, can you bring the keys?
Help!
You slammed the door.
Yeah.
Any punctures?
No!
You slammed the door.
No punctures?
No punctures?
Aah!
That, Jones... is because this version of the iron maiden uses a mechanical device to do its work.
See?
Instead of being impaled immediately, the victim would suffer the slow advance of the spikes.
It's neat.
Good job this IS the more sophisticated version.
Otherwise...
Got the keys?
Thank you.
Come on.
Break in.
Yeah, seems so.
And take a look at this.
Something has taken the polish off the table.
Water stains?
It could be.
Dunno.
Ask Forensics to pay us a visit.
Detective Sergeant Jones?
Lynton Pargeter.
We spoke on the phone.
Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby.
Causton CID.
Chief Inspector.
Oh, dear.
Did you do this?
No, sir, we did not.
You've had a break-in.
Perhaps you'd look around.
See if you've got anything missing.
Apart from my tenant workers
Just in time.
I got you a Chicken Jalfrezi.
Didn't have time to cook.
What?
Busy day, love?
Yes.
I went to a fascinating talk at Beau Clayton village hall.
Cyrus LeVanu.
Oh, for crying out loud.
He's a very interesting man.
He's not interesting.
He's a con, a charlatan, a phoney.
Have you seen his TV show?
Yes.
Well, it's... it's... it's laughable.
Isn't it?
I mean, what does he call himself?
The ghostbuster
Ghost HUNTER.
Ghost hunter.
You have a closed mind.
I do not have a closed mind.
I'm a copper.
I can spot a phoney a mile away and LeVanu fits the bill exactly.
What's he doing in Causton?
The ghostly monks.
He's here for the anniversary.
What anniversary?
Of the massacre.
It's tomorrow.
He's holding a ceremony of spiritual healing in the woods.
Did I order that?
Unquiet spirits, speak to me.
I feel something.
Something tremulous in the ether.
Something that speaks of bloodshed and darkness.
A spirit voice crying for help.
Oh, wonderful
We're in the company of troubled souls.
Excuse me...
Mr LeVanu.
Are you a seeker after truth?
No.
Er, yes...
Well, not en-
I am a police officer.
Detective Chief Inspector Barnaby from Causton CID.
And these woods, sir, are off limits.
Is this a crime scene?
Well, no.
It isn't.
Quite.
These woods are full of voices of tormented souls, Mr Barnaby.
And I'm here to bring them peace.
With the express permission of Mr Lynton Pargeter.
Pargeter?
Full... and express permission... of Mr Pargeter.
Our mission begins.
Restless spirit, speak to me.
Unquiet spirit, speak to me.
My God!
What was that?
A spirit presence calling for help.
We must go deeper.
Always deeper.
How long's he been dead?
Well, it's a shallow grave, so some insulation.
Looking at the state of the body, insect infestation and so on, at least three days.
You must have known Colin Thomas.
Is this him?
No, I met Molly once, but never Colin.
Ah!
Gail.
Can you identify the body?
He'd be able to help.
What with being able to talk to the dead
So.
Is this Colin Thomas or Stanley Goodfellow?
Neither of them.
I've never seen that man before.
I was drawn to him, Barnaby.
Called by the dead.
Erm, this officer will take your statement,
Mr LeVanu - then you can go.
Go?
Go where?
It must be plain to you that I'm needed here.
I'm blessed with a great gift.
So, this man isn't one of my tenants.
No, we don't know who he is yet.
We'll be asking you to view the body in case you can identify him.
Me?
Why would I know him?
Just for elimination purposes.
Excuse me.
Yes, Gail.
Mr Pargeter.
I understand that you've given Cyrus LeVanu full access to the woods.
Yes, I have.
Well, it's making my job very difficult, sir.
You know some people think that Mr LeVanu is a charlatan?
A fraud?
Do you share their view?
On the contrary.
I think Cyrus LeVanu is a gifted psychic.
If the troubled souls of those who were murdered still wander these woods, perhaps LeVanu might find a way of bringing them... rest.
My granny used to read tea leaves.
She saw a ghost once.
It walked through the wall.
Why don't they use the doors, like everyone else?
Any news on those stains by the window?
Lab report says they're water stains, with minute traces of blood.
Ooh, not ectoplasm, then
Someone clearing up a bloodstain?
The bloodstains at the Goodfellows' cottage?
- Definitely human.
- Ooh, a scientific fact, at last
Did you ask about the postman?
Sam Nelms.
Lives in Beau Clayton.
And, yes.
There was a delivery made that morning.
Charlatan!
Anti-Christ!
How dare you come to my parish?
With your unholy gibberish of witchcraft.
And you are...?
The Reverend Wallace Stone.
I am the guardian of the moral health of the people of this parish.
People you seem happy to corrupt, with your wicked talk of psychic powers.
More than one path to the truth, Reverend Stone.
Blasphemy!
If there are restless souls in Monksbarton Woods... ..it's God's task to give them their rest.
Not that of an unscrupulous mountebank.
That's slander.
You'd do well to watch your tongue.
I foresee big trouble between those two.
And I don't need a crystal ball for that.
Anybody in?
What?
Causton CID.
What do we know about er...
Mr Nelms?
He's been a postman in Beau Clayton for three years.
Before that, delivery driver - sacked.
Before that, milkman - sacked.
Why?
Thought to be on the fiddle.
I gave a statement.
We know that, Mr Nelms.
May we come in?
It's a bit... difficult just now.
We know that, too
- She's um...
- None of our business, Mr Nelms.
I'd like the postal packet you were supposed to deliver to one of the cottages up at Monksbarton.
The what?
There must have been something to deliver, or why go there?
It must have been a packet, or why not put it through the letterbox?
It was so spooky.
Finding the place deserted.
I forgot about it.
Later, I realised I still had it.
Still... it can't be worth much, can it?
Little plastic statue.
That is a... is a Netski.
Look, Jones, how beautiful that is.
Is it... valuable?
Have you seen anything unusual up at the Monksbarton cottages recently?
Recently?
No.
Course, I've seen the lights in the woods of a dark morning.
And I've heard those weird noises.
But seeing as the woods are haunted, that's only to be expected.
You believe those stories?
Do I look simple?
Listen.
Um...
It'd be better if you could er... keep quite about things - you know.
Keep quiet about a theft?
No.
About my... friend.
Your boss'll have to know about this.
Yeah, well, jobs are easy enough to come by.
But erm...
She's a... speciality act.
What did you call it?
A net what?
A Netski.
Some of them are worth a fortune, others not.
And this one?
Go and ask the expert.
As discussed...
John Temple.
Yes, I remember.
She came in asking for a valuation.
And...?
Well, it's not ivory.
It's not old. 1950s, or thereabouts.
And carved from whale tooth.
Eighty quid, perhaps?
A hundred, at best.
I made her an offer over the phone.
She turned it down and I returned it by post.
I don't haggle.
A Mrs Smith, Sergeant Jones.
Mrs Smith.
Keep in line!
Creatures of darkness... hear me!
Creatures of darkness... hear me!
Creatures of darkness... hear me!
The Netski was taken to Temple Antiques by a Mrs Smith.
Obviously, Nesta Goodfellow or Molly Thomas.
Yeah.
Well, whoever took it... they certainly came from The Priory.
I think the present Mr Pargeter has been strapped for cash.
Hm.
You say some kids...
called at the station?
Yes.
Up here on a dare.
Saw lights in the woods.
Oh, that'd be the wandering souls of the dead
Is the entire population of Beau Clayton... suffering from ghost fever?
Let my words reach you.
Let the flame of love be your balm.
Speak to me out of the dark.
I want you out of these woods, all of you!
And out now!
Mr Barnaby, we're conducting a healing ritual.
Anger has no place in the circle of the phoenix.
We're expecting a spirit presence.
Are you?
Yes, well, I'm sorry.
But this area really is now off limits.
So, I'd be very grateful if you'd all leave.
And I'll arrest you... if you don't.
You heard that?
We all heard that!
The dead are speaking to me.
You must have heard it, sir.
It was a fox.
Or it was a bird or... whatever.
It didn't sound like a bird.
No, you're right.
It didn't, did it?
No.
And who are they?
I told you.
I don't know!
But I would never leave them to this scum of Corinth.
No.
They'll be my very own assassins.
They'll take the princess a gown of silk.
A golden crown.
But these, I'll drench in poison so strong that anyone who touches them will die in agony.
But the thing that tears my heart... ..is what must happen next.
I shall kill my children.
Kill them both.
No-one shall save them.
No-one shall own them.
And when I've brought both Jason and his house to ruin, I shall leave this land.
Unnatural woman, flying from the death cries of my darlings.
From their blood.
Their blood.
Their blood!
How is it I can bear such guilt... ..but not the laughter of my enemies?
'I thought you said your dog didn't bite .' 'Whose dog?
'
'Your dog.' 'Yeah.
But that's not my dog.' 12-bore shotgun, apparently.
Shot in the back.
- It was Molly Thomas, wasn't it?
- Positive ID from Mr Pargeter, yeah.
Bullard thinks she'd only been dead a few hours.
So, what do you think?
I think that um...
She goes for the phone.
She doesn't make it.
She pulls the table over.
She turns the radio on full blast.
To try and attract attention.
I think the effort of...
reaching for the radio must have finished her off.
So, the question is...
how did she get back here?
And where from?
And why did she come back?
Where's Pargeter now?
He went back to The Priory.
She was shot in this room, wasn't she?
And she was shot in the back.
She wasn't running away.
It looks as if she was facing the wall.
Whoever killed her... couldn't look her in the face when they pulled the trigger.
Speak to me... ..and I will bring you peace.
To those who worship false gods,
I say...
'Harken and tremble... ..you root of all evil, you author of pain, you begetter of death!
You will be cast out with every Satanic power, with every unclean spirit, and your voice will be stilled and your hand will be stayed, and your eye will be blind.
TURN from your way of darkness!
TURN from the devil's paths!
Or you must suffer the torments of hell through all eternity!
'
Well?
That was my rehearsal for Sunday.
Oh.
I'm sorry, Wallace.
I wasn't really listening.
So, you were out walking, Mr Pargeter.
Am I right?
- Yes.
- In the woods.
They are my woods, Barnaby.
So, you're not put off by talk of ghosts.
I frequently walk there.
I've come to no harm.
But you've seen the lights?
Heard strange cries?
From time to time.
My family have lived with these phenomena for many, many years.
If there are ghosts, it would seem I've come to terms with them.
So, you're coming back from your walk... you hear the radio... you go into the cottage and you find Mrs Thomas?
Yes.
You didn't see anyone?
Hear a car driving away?
The place was... deserted.
Just...
Molly Thomas lying there.
And erm... the radio on.
You're quite a collector, Mr Pargeter.
In a small way.
Mostly pieces acquired by my family.
Of course, some of them have gone to my least favourite charities
My ex-wives.
Also collectors, in their way
So, you've got er... valuable antiques here, family heirlooms.
And no alarm system.
I did have one.
It tended to go off three or four times a week.
For no good reason.
Stanley and Nesta Goodfellow kept an eye on things.
Yes, but they're not here now, are they, Mr Pargeter?
Two murders, three people missing.
Don't you think you'd be safer staying at the pub in Beau Clayton?
But there's no alarm, Barnaby, as you pointed out.
And all these valuable things.
As you said.
Did you see that?
Indeed, I did.
I think, Jones... ..whatever is in those woods... it's time we met it face to face.
Come on.
Do ghosts have faces?
Oh, I think they do, yes.
Except the headless ones
- Stay close.
- I will
Did you hear that?
Where's that coming from?
I think it came from over there.
Ah.
There's an echo, isn't there?
Hard to tell.
Jones!
Where are you?
I'm here, sir!
Where are YOU?
Sir?
Jones?
Sir.
Are you there, sir?
Aargh!
Jones?
!
Aargh!
Aargh!
Who's there?
!
Sir!
Aargh!
Jones.
I heard you call for help.
I did not call for help.
I was attacked... by an owl.
I saw something.
What?
I don't know.
Well, whatever it was, Jones, it was not a ghost.
Someone has been tracking me.
But now I am the tracker.
Come on.
Stanley?
It's Stanley Goodfellow.
Excuse me.
I'm looking for Dr McKay.
Mr Barnaby.
Yes.
I'm Mary McKay.
Stanley's upstairs.
This way.
Thank you.
Stanley is suffering from dissociative trauma.
He experienced something so terrifying, his mind has simply closed down on him.
It's a defence mechanism, of course.
Well, at the moment, Stanley Goodfellow is the only man who can solve the disappearance of his wife and two other people.
My problem is... he can't speak.
Well... he's not saying anything anyone can understand.
Words are a danger to Stanley just now.
His subconscious is telling him to reject speech because... whatever happened to him lies beyond description.
Well, when will he be um...?
He's lost touch with reality, Mr Barnaby - we just can't say when he'll want to return, if ever.
Oh.
Excuse me.
Jones?
Mystery body in the woods, sir.
Positive ID from The Met.
Terence Paul Lowther.
Part of a well-organised London gang that specialise in nicking antiques.
Good work.
I'm just leaving The Pines now.
Nothing yet from Stanley Goodfellow.
- Well if you're on your way back...
- I'll pick you up.
I want to go down to the village, pick up on the local gossip.
OK.
We'll talk then.
Bye.
Your details, please?
Gail...?
Are you free this evening?
After work?
For a chat.
Yeah.
Where shall we go?
Oh, a pub.
Yeah.
Yeah, lovely.
- And here endeth...
- The first lesson
And here beginneth the second
The Met said Lowther could be linked to half a dozen robberies involving antiques.
That antique shop fellow.
John Temple?
What did he say about the Netski?
He reckoned it was worth about ã100.
Said it was modern - nothing special.
Did he?
Meaning...?
Maybe he was conning her into selling it for a song.
You know.
In either case, it must have been taken from The Priory.
Why didn't Pargeter...
report the theft?
See that?
Yeah.
I'll follow you in.
Yeah, OK.
Excuse me.
Could I...?
This village is ghost crazy, if you ask me.
There you go, mate.
Oh, look out.
Here's the law.
Hello, Mr Nelms.
A man of leisure, thanks to you lot.
Gardening leave.
Don't let me interrupt you, sir.
Carry on.
What were you saying?
That something weird's going on.
But spirits?
Spooks?
I don't think so.
Shall we sit and wait for them to come outside?
Jones.
Detective Chief Inspector.
Mr Pargeter.
I was intending to come to see you.
I heard.
You did?
About what?
Stanley Goodfellow.
You found him.
Yes, indeed.
In your woods.
Is it true that he's lost his mind?
He's under medical supervision just now.
I'm hoping to be able to speak to him in due course.
But er... this is what I wanted to talk to you about.
Ah, yes.
Yes.
It was supposed to be delivered to the Goodfellows.
Not really their thing.
We wondered if they were taking it in for you.
No.
No, no.
This has no great value.
It's... nice enough.
I'm going to an antiques fair in France for a couple of days.
I'd be grateful if the police could watch The Priory while I'm away.
Mr Pargeter, two murders have been committed.
Both bodies were found on your land.
A visit to France...
out of the question.
This is outrageous.
I have business to attend to.
Friend of yours?
Who?
Jones.
- Not his netsuke, then?
- Oh, no
Of course it is.
He's up to something.
Are we mobile yet?
Pit-stop wheel change, sir.
Oh, good.
Time in the Traffic Division not wasted, then
Thank you.
Exorcizamus te... ..omnis incursio infernalis adversarii...
..omnis legio, omnis congregatio, et secta diabolica!
Jesu Christi!
I adjure you, Satan.
Yield now to God.
Depart, accursed one!
Depart, foul fiend!
Depart -
If there ARE restless souls in these woods, they are the souls of godly men.
And it is the work of God's minister to bring them deliverance.
And you saw no-one.
No.
Just...
Sitting up in his grave as if it were... judgment day.
Gases.
Post-mortem gases, causing expansion and consequent movement.
- It sometimes happens in the morgue.
- Really?
A body rising under a sheet.
He was buried.
It was a shallow grave, like the other victim.
He was barely covered in earth.
Whoever buried him must've been in a hurry.
Or didn't have the tools to do the job.
Do we know who he is?
Yes.
It's Colin Thomas.
Positive ID from Stephens.
Cause of death, George.
Shotgun wound.
12-bore, by the look of it.
So, we've got two people dead, one mad, one still missing.
Why these people?
What was it about them that made them the victims, eh?
There's something we're still not seeing.
Right.
Let's start again.
Let's have another look round the cottages.
Sir!
Ticket to Florida in the name of Nesta Goodfellow.
With a note.
Saying...?
See you at the airport.
Is that note signed?
Sex bomb.
Our over-eager postman?
I wonder if her husband knew.
What?
Someone's in there!
Oi!
Hey... hey!
Don't kill him, sir!
He'll kill himself if he carries on.
How fast is he going?
He'll come out over on the Beau Clayton road, won't he?
Whoa!
Lost him!
Not necessarily.
Take a look round the back.
Please don't say it was a hunch.
Observation.
Saw it first time we called.
Didn't you?
Make sure he doesn't jump out of the back window and escape or something.
Muddy ride, was it
Did you find anything?
No.
A few coins in a jar.
Thought they might have other bits and pieces hidden away.
Why were they hidden?
They were at it.
Nicking stuff up at The Priory.
A little nick here, a little nick there.
You had a look around in the Goodfellows' cottage as well.
Didn't you?
Did you see anything you fancied in there?
You can't get a 40-inch plasma screen on a mountain bike.
'I am the way and the truth and the life, ' says the Lord.
For tempters and blasphemers abound.
And those who love evil are in our midst.
The times are out of joint... where wrongdoers prosper and the spawn of Satan multiplies.
Where the virtue finds no respect.
For who does not know that, in the face of such evil, it takes a man of courage to stand up unafraid and say, 'I am for divine justice and retribution'?
Stanley.
Did you know, Stanley... that Nesta... was getting ready to run off and leave you?
I wonder if you...
I wonder if you knew that.
You hold the key...
Stanley.
Somewhere inside.
Sorry.
What happened to you, eh?
The number plate of that SUV was on the computer.
Stolen from an address in Chelsea a week ago.
Right.
Let Chelsea know it's been spotted here.
And get our Traffic Division to watch out for it.
Yes, Sarge.
I don't know why you're coming.
You said you think he's a fake.
Well, he's a prime suspect, for starters, Joyce.
It's a bit odd, him suddenly turning up in Midsomer.
A bit opportune, don't you think?
Maybe all this psychic drivel is a cover for something more sinister.
Don't be ridiculous.
Why on earth should he want to kill anyone?
Give him someone to talk to.
The powers with which I have been gifted led me to the grave of a man who'd fallen victim to the forces of evil.
I intend to use these same powers... to envision the whereabouts...
..of a missing woman.
Nesta Goodfellow.
I'm so glad I came Shh!
The knife of light will point the way.
I shall fall into a trance... ..and concentrate on the strong psychic projection of her fear.
I shall seek her out in the dark night of her distress.
Aargh!
I can see her!
Agh!
She lies... beneath the sign of the witch.
Oh!
Of the witch!
For goodness sake.
Come on!
I mean, to talk to the dead!
How stupid is that?
I mean, what is the point of talking to someone who is incapable of listening?
You might do worse than follow up on what he said!
Oh, you mean, the inspired vision?
Well, look.
Let's see.
A dark place, he says.
Three people have died, two buried in shallow graves.
Of course he talks about a dark place!
And the sign of the witch?
Witches.
Stock in trade of the phoney psychic.
Witches are bound to be top of the agenda.
He fainted!
Of course he did.
And how theatrical that was.
It's fine.
All clear.
Right.
I got your message.
YES...
Jones.
Sorry, sir.
Are you all right?
Of course I'm all right.
I didn't expect you to ambush me.
What happened?
Pargeter and the others loaded some furniture in the SUV and drove off.
That's why he had to stay in the house.
Half those antiques he's got there?
Stolen.
He's still in there.
Good chance to nab him.
No.
We should wait.
He doesn't know we're onto him.
And I don't want to scare off the delivery boys.
Did it occur to you to follow them?
I made a quick phone call.
They won't be looking for a woman driver.
Uh-huh.
I see.
And you're absolutely certain.
OK.
Thank you.
Morning, Jones.
Morning, sir.
Call from the lab.
Blood in the Goodfellows' cottage?
Definitely not Colin Thomas's.
Not?
Nope.
So, it's not Lowther's and it's not Colin Thomas's.
That poses a few questions.
Yeah.
And Pargeter's got more than a few to answer.
- Where are you going?
- Well, I thought we were...
No, no, no.
I think we give Pargeter and Temple a little more rope.
Come on.
Maybe if we get off the track...
Maybe what?
Of course...
I could be wrong.
Surely not
And after the news here on Radio Causton, we'll be talking to psychic and ghost hunter Cyrus LeVanu, whose latest book Talking To The Dead has just been published, and asking him about his recent sensational experiences
in the famously haunted Monksbarton Woods.
Yes.
Ooh!
That was close.
We're getting near.
Gotcha!
That sound you're hearing, Jones.
It's the sound of a radio signal being blocked.
Somewhere... ..up in that tree.
Well, it's not gonna be me.
Fine.
Jones?
We've got another one here.
Oh!
Ah!
There you are.
What have you got?
Ah.
I think we'll find this little gizmo is well stocked with mysterious noises.
And I reckon we'll find a few others like this, courtesy of Cyrus LeVanu.
How did you know?
How?
Well...
last night, after my car got stuck,
I had to walk about half a mile through these woods.
I could hear the cries and I knew there must be some sort of rational explanation.
And I thought how convenient all this was for Cyrus LeVanu.
Obviously, the woods weren't full of his supporter stooges whispering on cue.
And then I thought I heard this buzzing sound.
Aagh!
And I...
You all right, Jones?
I'm absolutely fine, sir.
Thanks for asking.
Well, come on.
And then I thought, it's not ectoplasmic eruption we're talking about here.
It's radio waves.
And then you found the body.
I mean...
Wow!
That must have been one hell of a shock, wasn't it?
Not if, like me, you've been gifted with special powers.
Gail...
Oh, yeah?
On now?
Thanks for letting me know.
What's that?
This.
My last meeting was a complete sellout, so I will hold another one.
Tonight at Beau Clayton Town Hall.
And, although there are those who would prevent me,
I've every intention of returning to Monksbarton Woods.
Where you'll be...
Talking To The Dead!
Well, that's all we've got time for, so a big thank you to our guest, the psychic adventurer, Cyrus Leva-
Where's our 'psychic adventurer' staying?
Er, The Monk's Retreat.
I shall go there.
I want you to go to Temple Antiques.
For whatever was shipped over there last night.
Yeah.
Oh!
Local radio shows might seem small beer for someone like me.
There you go.
But er... the most important thing is to get the message across.
Loud and clear.
Loud and clear, Mr LeVanu!
Like the signals from your transmitters.
Barnaby, what are you talking about?
Do you not know, Mr LeVanu?
I'm talking about the mysterious cries in Monksbarton Woods.
But, of course, there is a logical explanation.
As you well know.
Where do you transmit from?
Your room here?
Your car?
Or do you have an accomplice, who helps you with your special effects?
I've never seen this object before in my life.
What I find offensive about people like you,
Mr LeVanu, is that you feed off other people's anxieties.
And their pain.
You trade on their weaknesses.
Ooh!
Listen to that.
How spooky is that?
Frightened me to death
Detective Inspector Jones, isn't it?
Sergeant.
I was wondering if you'd had any more contact with Mrs Smith, the woman who -
Brought in the Netski.
No.
I did agree to phone if I -
Yes.
I was just passing and thought it just as easy to pop in.
Will you excuse me?
Hello?
Yes...
Yes.
Erm...
Yes.
I think we'd agreed the fourth of April.
Well, you could bring it in in the morning.
Oh, Gail.
There's pictures on here of some items of furniture.
Let's see if Art and Antiques can recognise something.
Right...
Sarge?
Are we still on?
It's just that, last night -
You were on extra duty.
Of course.
Gail.
Gail?
Look...
What?
No workplace involvements.
It's just tough to have a... proper working relationship if...
we also have... ..a relationship.
You think so?
It's never been a problem for me in the past.
Vile and untruthful accusations have been made against me.
Those whom I considered steadfast have abandoned me.
Even thrown aside their belief.
No, it's you they've thrown aside.
Why?
Because you've been exposed as a liar and a cheat.
That's slanderous!
Not if it's the truth.
And it is, which is why your slavish followers have abandoned you.
I never put transmitters in trees.
No, of course not
Now everyone's seen you in your true colours... ..why don't you pack up your tricks and your hocus-pocus and leave?
Leave?
I won't be leaving.
I will be returning to Monksbarton Wood in the hope of bringing peace to souls in torment.
Poison, LeVanu.
Your fake philosophy is poison.
Your ridiculous rituals are poison.
You are poison.
Jones.
Sir.
Quick response from the photos I took at Temple Antiques.
Four items definitely stolen, two suspected.
The table with the water stain is part of a haul from a house in Devon.
The Devon Police are pretty sure a London gang was involved.
They turned them over, but no result.
So, the stuff must have gone to a receiver the next day.
Pargeter fences it to dealers.
Including John Temple.
He's got the outlets - here and abroad.
That's why he wanted to go to the antiques fair in France.
The SUV guys are his distributors.
Now all we have to do...
is find the murderer.
Barnaby.
You checked house and garden?
Thoroughly.
He's not here.
I'm sure of that.
You said you found a weapon.
Ah, yes.
Here.
Has anyone touched it?
No.
There's blood on the blade.
What kind of a knife is it?
It's er... a kris.
It's a collector's item.
An antique?
Got backup?
On the way.
He's here, all right.
It's time to put the screws on Mr Lynton Pargeter.
Let's hurry.
Right.
Take the upstairs rooms.
I'll look down here.
And be careful.
I heard one of those cries.
Yes, I know.
It was me.
Take a look at that.
We have seriously misjudged Cyrus LeVanu.
It was Pargeter, not LeVanu, responsible for those strange noises in the woods.
His way of keeping the locals out while he took delivery of stolen goods.
And the mysterious lights...
must have been from the vans.
Delivering the dodgy antiques.
Well, he's packed a case, so it seems he'll be back.
Oh, he will.
Airline ticket.
Guess where to.
Florida.
Yep.
Pargeter and Nesta Goodfellow?
What's that?
Jones?
In the woods, behind The Priory.
Behind The Priory!
Into the woods.
Come on, quick!
All right?
Straight through!
Gone.
Yeah.
Gone to ground.
Come on.
How long can you keep this up, Stanley?
Another week?
- Oh, very good, Stanley.
- It's very good
Had me fooled.
Where is she, Stanley?
Where is Nesta?
Stay with him.
Dear God.
Nesta?
!
Jones?
!
I'm going to talk... to Mr Goodfellow whilst you pay Mr Temple a visit.
Yes, sir.
Once it started... no going back.
Pargeter was a fence, a receiver of stolen goods.
You knew that.
And he knew you knew.
We could see what he was up to.
What could he do?
If we didn't take too much, he didn't worry.
All of you?
Colin and Molly Thomas too?
Colin was up for it.
Molly was unhappy.
She... tried to get him to stop.
If she'd succeeded, he wouldn't have got involved in the murder of Terry Lowther, would he?
I didn't mean to kill him.
He broke in.
He knew that Pargeter was in London, so he didn't expect to see anyone.
And you took him on.
The water stains on the antique table and the carpet.
They were caused when you mopped up the blood.
Mm.
Then we buried him in the woods.
But then Colin lost his nerve, didn't he?
It'll be all right.
How can it be all right?
He's dead.
He went home and told Molly.
We've talked it over, Stan.
It's the only thing to do.
They wanted to go to the police.
You buried him.
But you killed him.
We hid the body.
You think the police are gonna be understanding?
That's it, Stan.
You can do as you please.
No, Stan.
Please.
No.
I didn't know what to do.
I wasn't going to prison.
I knew that much.
We was on a good thing, up there at The Priory.
If only they'd listened to reason.
I thought I'd keep them in the woods till they saw sense.
And then Colin decided to have another go at me.
No!
No, please!
Please, stop it!
No!
Colin!
The thing was...
I didn't mean to kill him either.
It was just...
one thing after another.
You know?
Just... one thing after another.
You buried Colin Thomas, just as you buried Terry Lowther.
I made the women do it.
Get up!
I was gonna go back later and make a proper job of it.
But...
I knew I couldn't trust them.
So... we had to keep moving round the woods, stay ahead of the police.
But I had to find somewhere to keep 'em.
Somewhere safe.
So you thought of this shack.
Well...
I used to work as a 'keeper on the estate, before I worked at The Priory.
I know every inch of these woods.
But something went wrong, didn't it, Stanley?
Molly Thomas somehow managed...
to escape.
They thought I would kill 'em.
I hadn't thought about it.
I hadn't thought about anything much.
Molly ran indoors.
I was close behind.
No.
Aargh!
I saw where she went.
There was nothing for it.
Well... no way back.
Not then.
But I...
I couldn't...
You couldn't look at her, could you?
Turn round.
What... what have you done?
Perhaps I should have killed Nesta then.
Yeah.
I should have killed her.
But I didn't.
The fact is, Stanley, you very nearly did.
Well, that was your fault.
I put her in the well, keep her out of trouble.
Then you caught me and she was stuck down there.
And she must have been down there when we found you the first time.
She didn't have the strength to call out.
And this is my fault?
Definitely.
Oh, yeah.
That was down to you.
Stanley, you could have told someone where she was.
She was getting ready to leave me.
I knew that.
Stealing things to pay for it all.
Did you know it was Lynton Pargeter... that she was having an affair with?
Not until he came at me with a knife.
I wasn't expecting it.
Otherwise he'd never have got close enough.
What have you done, you bastard?
Where's Nesta?
Dead?
Aargh!
Then it was him... or me.
No choice in the matter.
You caught up with him at The Priory.
What I don't understand is how you got there so quickly.
I mean, all he had to do was grab his case, chuck it into a car and he'd be gone.
I've lived round Beau Clayton all my life.
I know every track, every shortcut.
His bad luck.
He got back first.
But I came across the fields.
He wasn't quick enough.
No!
Aaaargh!
John Temple is very anxious to co-operate.
Is he?
Shouldn't be long before we find Pargeter's delivery men.
Was he...
Forthcoming?
Yes.
Surprisingly so.
Except... perhaps not such a surprise.
Sir?
He could have been miles away by the time we found the body.
Yet, when we chased him, where does he come?
He comes back here.
Where we found him in the first place.
Perhaps he wanted to be caught.
Perhaps he wanted her to be found.
See?
It's all your fault, really.
Still doing his mad act, then?
I'm not sure he's acting.
Not now.
A horseshoe over water.
A witch's sign, my Welsh granny used to say.
She's in a dark place.
It's dark.
She cannot speak, she cannot see.
She lies... beneath the sign of the witch!
No.
It's nonsense.
I preached to the people, Sarah.
Now the truth has been heard.
The blasphemer is unmasked.
Sarah?
I'm sorry, Wallace.
I've had enough.
What do you mean?
I don't understand.
No.
Of course you don't.
Surely it's too late for the postman.
No.
Perfect timing.
So, it was your fault.
What was my fault?
It was your fault that LeVanu was accused of fraud.
He is a fraud.
You're such a cynic.
Joyce... people like ghost stories, they enjoy being scared.
It's basic human nature.
You don't believe it all, do you?
Well, why not?
I have an open mind.
Unlike some people.
Hm.
All right.
Come on.
I don't care how you rationalise it.
There's definitely something spooky here.
Yeah.
Well, so people say.
Accounts of the mass murder in Monksbarton Woods have been handed down from generation to generation.
There is a theory that the very stones of The Priory, even the earth, where the victims fell, is imprinted with psychic recordings of those terrible events.
And Cyrus LeVanu traded on that theory.
I was wrong about LeVanu just in one respect.
It was Pargeter, not LeVanu, who put... speakers in the trees to scare off...
the locals.
Right.
Let's see if we can summon up...
a ghostly presence for you.
Joyce?
Joyce?
Joyce.
What is it?
Are you all right?
What's the matter?
What's the matter?
Very strange, and difficult to explain, really.
Is it, George?
Stan Goodfellow encounters him in the woods, thinks he might raise the alarm and kills him to keep him quiet.
No, Tom.
This man died recently.
This morning, in fact.
Long after Stanley Goodfellow was arrested.
No.
It's the manner of his death.
I've heard of it and never seen it.
Parasympathetic rebound.
It happens when someone is so terrified that the whole metabolic system reacts and tries to calm itself down.
The problem is, it can make too good a job of it, and the heart simply stops beating.
I don't know what it was he encountered in Monksbarton Woods.
Frankly, I hope I never find out.
Aargh!
Parasympathetic rebound.
You're telling me that Cyrus LeVanu... died of fright.
(man) You ever wake up in the morning and think,
"Man, life is good.
I mean, it just can't get any better than this."
It's all beautiful and perfect and wonderful and amazing, and then, one day, that one thing happens that changes everything.
(bomb whistling)
- I'm pregnant.
- (man) That's only one test.
(man sighs) Oh, boy.
(Morgan) What kind of a world am I bringing a kid into?
They say the most important job a father has is to keep his baby safe.
But how am I going to do that?
I can cover the electrical sockets, or childproof Mommy's pill bottles, but that's just inside the house.
- What about out there?
- (sirens wailing)
There's cults, muggers, drugs, violence.
Not to mention all of the predators now lurking about.
I could move from the East Village to a family friendly neighborhood in Brooklyn, but is that enough to keep my child safe?
- And what about the big things?
- (thunder rumbles)
Things like hurricanes, earthquakes or tsunamis?
And that's just that mean, old, Mother Nature.
What about the really big things?
Things we should really be afraid of.
Like the most wanted man on the planet.
What about him?
We've got the strongest military, sneakiest spies and coolest technology in the entire world, but we can't find one man hiding in
Afghanibaluchapakiwaziristan?
(man) After 9/11, I thought some satellite would shoot a laser down onto the earth, fry up an omelet bin Laden and save us all.
But that wasrt the case.
I know, maybe he's dead.
But maybe he's alive.
Maybe he's on dialysis.
Maybe he's a nine foot bionic ninja with X-ray vision and the power of flight.
All I know is that in the last six years, there've been more acts of terrorism, worldwide, than in 20 years leading up to it.
Today, there are known terrorist cells in more than 100 countries around the world.
By the time my kid's out of diapers, everyone's gonna be a terrorist.
Nowhere's gonna be safe.
With Operation Special Delivery only 19 weeks away,
I just can't sit around and do nothing.
If the CIA and the FBI can't find him, and I'm going to make this world safe for my child, it's time for a new plan.
If I've learned anything from big budget action movies, it's that complicated global problems are best solved by one lonely guy crazy enough to think he can fix everything before the credits roll.
And I'm going to find out once and for all:
Where in the world is Osama bin Laden?
(all hollering)
(hooting)
Moustache ride.
Reign of Terror!
I'm gonna get you, Osama been hiding.
(Morgan) I wanted to talk to you because I'm getting ready to do a lot of travel.
I wanted to see if I'm going to need any shots, anything...
Where are you going to be going?
We're going to go look for Osama bin Laden.
OK. (laughs) You'll probably find him.
Um, you're going to need a whole bunch of shots and prescriptions.
- You want to do it, want to go for it?
- I'm going to need it all, right?
- How many shots am I getting?
- Diphtheria, tetanus, polio.
Typhoid, meningitis, hepatitis A and B.
This one I must tell you about.
This is your yellow fever.
About one in one million people who get the yellow fever shot, get a very, very bad reaction.
They get multi-system organ failure.
There are six reported cases or more, maybe seven or eight.
And about four of them died.
(Morgan) Going to need more than shots to keep me safe in the places I'm heading to.
(man) This is reality-based personal protection, teaching you how to survive explosions, small arms attacks, sniper attacks, chemical attacks.
We cover it all.
We're going to simulate a hand grenade attack.
Boom!
You would have been killed.
I'll show you how to survive.
The first thing you want to do is turn away from the grenade and dive.
You're in a perfect position.
This is going to save your life by 98 percent.
When someone's head explodes, that's what it looks like.
Even though it's tragic, we can't focus on this, we got to think about survival.
Look at the wall there.
What do you see?
- (Morgan) I see blood.
- (Wagner) OK, good.
We have the "blood splatter."
How do we determine where the sniper is at, based on our situation here?
Hold up a hat on a stick.
If I'm in a restaurant, I don't want to sit in the middle.
If a gunman came, where is he most likely to hit?
You're dead here.
This is what we call the "fatal funnel."
You want to stay behind that line, you want to stay off the wall.
You're dead here.
You're dead here.
Any time you leave your vehicle, you gotta assume, in dangerous places, someone could plant a bomb on your vehicle.
You're dead here.
- (both laughing)
- You're dead here.
Here's what I recommend, you go around the corner, and then you can pull it open, and if it doesn't go boom, you can go check it out.
Gonna be the most paranoid person in the Middle East.
Maybe that's a good thing.
Because if I'm going to find Osama,
I'm traveling to scary places.
In the last year, the State Department issued over 100 warnings about traveling to the Middle East.
Mainly because Americans are now bigger targets for kidnapping and murder.
(Wagner) Now we're going to have a little classroom time about kidnapping.
Here are some basics of surviving as a hostage.
You got to accept it and start planning on how you're going to survive it.
Speak only if spoken to.
- Is this the crew's, the cameramars?
- No.
(Wagner) Don't provoke the captors.
Don't stare at them.
Don't have a harsh tone of voice.
Don't be argumentative.
Don't have an attitude.
These people are in control, not you.
(man) This is not a fucking game.
(Wagner) Especially when you're in Baghdad, Kabul, or you're in Turkey, this stuff is going on daily, and you gotta be prepared for it.
I'm usually a pretty calm person when it comes to crazy shit happening around me.
But that's a whole other level of crazy.
(guitar riffs play)
We wage a war to save a civilization itself.
(guitar riffs play)
They hate us, our country.
They hate the liberties for which we stand.
(guitar riffs play)
Until you catch the chicken, you don't have the chicken.
Want you to get used to the sound of the language.
- (both making consonant sounds)
- Oh, good, Wow.
Go for the eyes.
The eyes!
Are you going to convert to Muslim or not?
Shoot him, shoot him.
I recommend you wear the clothes.
Maybe you can hit the tanning salon a little bit.
- (shots firing) - (yelling)
- Grenade!
- (screaming)
Somebody said I should grow my beard out?
Yeah, for you.
Because you obviously look very foreign.
- Look at this area.
Much bigger, right?
- This guy is probably alive.
(speaking foreign language)
You could have a situation where a device explodes and it gets on you.
Oh, fuck!
I brought you these outfits.
Hopefully, it keeps you safe.
This is a normal reaction.
He's fine.
How do I say, "Don't take me, take the cameraman?"
He's alive!
You have to know the way an Islamic terrorist thinks.
(Morgan) Jim's right.
I need to learn how Osama thinks.
To find a fox, you need to think like a fox.
I need to get inside his head and learn what makes him tick.
I need to explore the world he comes from.
Meet the people who influenced him.
Visit the places that shaped him into who he is today.
And, most of all, I need to try to understand what drives an Osama bin Laden to begin with.
I know just the place to start.
(beeping)
Egypt is the birthplace of one of the heaviest hitters in the world of terrorism.
Ayman Al-Zawahiri.
He's Al-Qaeda's Team Manager and Osama's personal mentor.
His stats are pretty impressive.
He was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood at the age of 14.
He's a life-long follower of Sayyid Qutb, the man credited with creating modern day Islamic fundamentalism, is currently the number two of Al-Qaeda, and he's a Gemini.
And I got a tip where to find his uncle, Mahfouz Azzam.
If he can tell me where the A-man is, odds are Osama won't be too far away.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Mahfouz?
(speaks Arabic)
- It's nice to see you.
Welcome.
- Nice to see you.
- Thank you.
- Please.
- It's a beautiful day today.
Very nice.
- Yeah.
- (Morgan) So do you know where he is?
- (man in Arabic) No.
Where do you think he is?
(in Arabic) If you learn where he is, I beg you, let me know.
I just want to make sure he is OK.
He won't let me know by phone because you kill people with the phone.
The Russians killed the president of Ohechnya with the phone, and you Americans have killed people with the phone.
This, a telephone, has become a lethal weapon!
And every month my bank account gets killed by my phone.
- (laughing)
- Which makes it even worse.
So, if you knew where he was, you wouldn't turn him in for the $25,000,000?
(laughs)
I would like to tell you something, the hungry who cannot find bread to eat in Afghanistan they wouldn't accept these $25 million of yours to turn in a Muslim they know is waging jihad for them.
So he's in Afghanistan?
- You say so.
- You said so.
You just told me.
America says so.
America says so.
- Do you think he's in Afghanistan?
- America says.
So if Al-Zawahiri and Osama bin Laden just disappeared tomorrow, would things change?
The seed that was sown by America, a seed of spitefulness, hate, aggression and killing, cannot disappear in the short term.
There has to be another foreign policy to uproot this seed.
(Morgan) It's easy to criticize American foreign policy, with the second most wanted terrorist in the family.
I should find regular folks who might be more objective.
What do you guys hear about Americans?
(in Arabic) The Americans are known to be fighting the Egyptians, Palestinians and Iraqis.
- We're fighting you?
- (laughing)
- Yes.
- Really?
I didn't even know that.
What are we fighting the Egyptians for?
(speaking Arabic)
You want to occupy Egypt.
(Morgan) Do we?
Why?
We're not that well versed in politics but that's what we hear on TV and stuff.
What do you think about America?
(in Arabic) They are good people, but we reject the American foreign policy.
(Morgan) How can he be against American foreign policy?
Egypt is one of our best friends in the region and in the global war on terror.
At the same time, it was home to five of the founding fathers of Al-Qaeda.
The guy who tried to blow up the World Trade Center in '93, and the ringleader of the 9/11 hijackings.
Maybe university students could tell me why Osama's making so many friends here.
It's about oppression, because Egypt is a developing country, so, like, the people who are oppressed are kind of more...
So it develops more terrorists, and that's it.
(in Arabic) These would be the minority, the rotten type.
Every society has the same.
Every society has good and bad.
In Egypt, people have no freedom.
And they try and prove to the government that they have freedom, deserve freedom, by committing terrorist attacks.
Did you vote in the last presidential election?
- No.
- No.
- You werert old enough yet?
- It's not that.
I don't believe in it.
I know it's rigged.
I know that Hosni Mubarak would have won anyway.
They call this a democratic country, but it's not.
In Egypt, if a president wants to stay in power, he'll stay in power.
(applause)
(Morgan) And Hosni Mubarak has been in power for more than 26 years.
The United States has got a close and meaningful relationship with Egypt.
(cheering)
This relationship is a cornerstone for our policy in the Middle East.
(Morgan) Policy that includes giving Mubarak an aid package, while looking the other way as he uses riot police and hired thugs armed with sticks, knives, swords and Molotov cocktails to keep the opposition from voting on election day.
You might say about Mubarak the same thing FDR said about another dictator.
He may be a son of a bitch, but he's our son of a bitch.
(Morgan) See, we've had a policy of propping up dictators for more than 50 years now.
When the Cold War started heating up, we decided to do what it took to stop communism from taking over.
And the United States started mixing with a rougher crowd.
Hmm!
In 1953, the CIA helped the Shah of Iran overthrow the Iranian government, to become their supreme ruler.
Sure, the Shah tortured or killed anyone who publicly disagreed with him.
Even went as far as shoving broken glass up the nether regions of critics.
But he totally hated Communism.
Now, he was a son of a bitch, but he was our son of a bitch.
The Shah kept Iran in our corner until 1979, when Ayatollah Khomeini's Islamic revolution swept to power, and held 52 Americans hostage for 15 months.
That's when we made friends with Saddam Hussein over in Iraq.
Now, he was an SOB too, but for ten years, while he was fighting the Iranians, he was our SOB.
In fact, by the mid-'80s, we had sons of bitches all the way from Latin America to the Middle East, but, hey, pimping freedom ain't easy.
(hip-hop music plays)
(Morgan) We needed to keep our SOBs happy and on our side.
So we provided them with tanks, guns, planes and more money.
Today we give Egypt more than 2 billion dollars a year in weapons and aid.
Sure, there's torture, murder and rampant political corruption, but somewhere along the way we decided that, in order to protect our own freedom, it was all right to sacrifice the freedom of others.
Does lack of democracy, human rights, in countries like Egypt encourage people to get involved in extremist radical groups?
Of course.
There's no doubt about this.
It's the one thing that I agree with George W. Bush about.
That people join terrorist organizations because there is no other way to be active.
The threat of terrorism created the climate of fear that is being exploited by the Mubarak regime and by George Bush.
We're going through a very difficult time now.
I mean, we have terrorists on one side, and opportunist, exploitative regimes on the other side.
The U.S. Can no longer claim the moral ground.
People have learned to expect a lot less from the U.S. Than they used to.
(Arabic music plays)
(man in Arabic) The United States is the main problem in the region, frankly.
We love the American people, but we hate the American government.
(in Arabic) We pray to God to destroy you because of what's happening.
(Morgan) America's filled with people who want people to live peacefully, to co-exist together, just like me.
OK, I don't want you to be there when it happens.
Have a smell.
(Morgan) You know, being in the States, all we get on the news are the crazy nuts that like to scream, "Death to you!"
And so you're like, "Oh, man.
Go get them."
But we've been in Egypt for a week now, talking to people, who are real people, just like you and me.
One after another after another everybody said,
"This government's corrupt and it's backed by the U.S."
- (chanting)
- It's hard for me to see how damaged the image of the country that I love and care about has become.
(phone rings)
- (Morgan) Hello?
- I got your postcard from Egypt today.
Oh, nice.
You sound good.
I am good.
Just promise you'll be here when it's really important.
OK?
I promise.
(woman) He has to be back by the first week of November, because I'm due the end of November, early December.
And, if he misses that, I'm going to be so upset.
And he's going to be upset.
But, also, he's going to these places that are so dangerous.
And I don't want him to miss anything.
And I don't want him to get hurt.
(man singing in Arabic)
(man in Arabic) While we are living in these troubled times, we need to be merciful.
So get mercy through praises and prayers upon Him because He is mercy.
And He puts compassion in your heart.
As a Muslim I am taught that God has honored humankind.
He did not say he honored Muslims and everyone else is a second class citizen.
(speaking Arabic) We have honored the children of heaven.
(singing in Arabic)
(man) Your average Egyptiars struggling like your average American to make ends meet, to get a decentjob, provide for his family, educate his kids.
The same concerns all over.
(Morgan) Torek is an Egyptian-American studying law at Al Azhar University.
He's a new dad and wants the world's view of Islam to change for the sake of his young son.
(Torek) We need to rectify this,
Muslims are over one fifth of the world population.
That's a lot of people.
It's not some Polynesian island somewhere.
- (Morgan laughs)
- That's a lot of people!
If four-fifths of the world are scared of one-fifth, what kind of civilization and humanity are we gonna have?
- (laughing) - (speaking Arabic)
Now they're going to think all we do is pray.
- Even the kids!
- I'm working on the voice-over.
From a very young age, they start manipulating the children.
(laughing)
(Torek) We need to differentiate between extreme factions in a population, and the regular, vast majority of people.
What do you think of the War on Terror?
It's a bogus term.
I don't think it means anything.
I think some guy that had too much to drink in the Pentagon, one night, came up with that.
- Dude, I got a great idea.
- A war on terrorism.
We had a war on drugs.
We didn't win that, either.
(Torek) But is it really a war on terror?
Have we eradicated terror?
Or are we exporting terror?
I think that...
Unfortunately, I think that we're exporting it.
I think that we lit the flame on a bomb.
(Morgan) The bomb Torek is speaking of is the explosive rise in terrorist attacks during the last seven years.
Al-Qaeda has now become a global franchise, serving up an unealthy dose of jihad to more and more people each year.
Ooh!
Oan I help you?
(Morgan) Despite the U.S. Spending over $500 billion fighting the war on terror,
Al-Qaeda continues to find new markets to expand into.
Thanks to heavy worldwide recruitment, which included having interested people filling out job applications, AQ is now back to its pre-9/11 strength.
Two of the U.S.'s closest allies, Spain and England, were both attacked by homegrown Al-Qaeda cells.
Even Muslim countries are finding they are in Al-Qaeda's crosshairs, often becoming the victims of terrorism and feeling the influence of Osama bin Laden firsthand.
(Arabic music plays)
(Morgan) Where is Osama bin Laden?
(in Arabic) He might be somewhere here in Morocco.
(in Arabic) How should I know?
- Bin Laden?
I am not a politic man.
- Yeah.
I don't know nothing about...
I'm a carpet dealer.
I sell carpet.
(Morgan) How many years has this tannery been here?
(in Arabic) Oenturies.
What do you think about people who cause violence in the name of Islam?
(in Arabic) It is not from Islam to kill innocent people or to blow yourself up.
I'm disgusted by that.
(Morgan) Do you ever worry that your sons may get involved with terrorists?
We worry about that.
We don't want them to get involved with that kind of crowd.
That's why we have to take care of them financially.
(man in Arabic) Americans are causing all the trouble in the world.
But...
Were the...
But this is my opinion of the American government, not the American people.
(in Arabic) These are all the problems that Bush created.
I heard that they want to eradicate Islam.
(Morgan) What do you think about Osama bin Laden?
(speaking Arabic)
(Morgan laughs) He's crazy?
(in Arabic) Osama bin Laden, look how many people he's killed, how many have died.
And what has he accomplished?
He's accomplished a wave of suicide bombings in Morocco killing more than 50 people over the last four years.
The first attack was in May of 2003, when recruiters outside the country came to town and convinced 14 young men to blow themselves up in exchange for money and the rewards of paradise.
They all grew up on the exact same street in the desperately poor ghetto of Sidi Moumen.
I met journalist Aboubakr Jamai, to find out what'd drive young men to cause such destruction.
(Jamai) I think it's a mix of ingredients.
And, depending on the situation, one of the ingredients is more important than the others.
And, these ingredients, I think in the case of Morocco, the socio-economic ingredient is the most important one.
It's not a coincidence that all of the guys who blew themselves up in the 16th of May, uh, 2003, came from this shantytown.
They were either unemployed or had menial jobs.
And they were completely outcast in their own society.
(Morgan) What do you think is the solution?
(Jamai) The problem in Morocco, with the people here, is that we fail to give them an economic voice and a political voice.
To me, that's the solution.
Need to give opportunity, economically speaking, because extremism nourishes itself from darkness.
(Morgan) That evening I was invited to dinner with Ahmed and his family, in the same 200 square-foot house he grew up in.
Ahmed doesn't want his children to fall prey to the same people the bombers did.
But with a poor education system and little money, he fears they could be exploited.
Thank you for letting us come here.
This is a great thing.
(in Arabic) Islam obligates us to be this way, to be brothers with everyone.
(Morgan) I'm about to have a baby in December.
Give me some fatherly advice.
You should take care of your wife.
I've got a good wife, so that's good.
If your relationship is based on love and good values, you will have good children.
(Morgan) Wow.
What kind of fish is that?
It's like a sardine.
It's delicious.
I'm glad.
Eat with good health.
So, I want you to tell me, what do you hope for your kids?
I want my kids to get an education.
The people who aren't educated won't accomplish anything in their life.
How did you do in school?
- (laughter)
- She's laughing!
She teases me.
Sometimes she and the kids gang up on me.
So do I have that to look forward to?
When you have your child they will do the same to you.
How hard is it to get a good education living in this area?
You can't get well educated living here, because of the poverty.
I'd like to hear your opinion.
When we hear about all these people who... what are your thoughts on those people?
Those people do not belong to Islam.
Even the terrorism that happened here was masterminded abroad.
The people who blew themselves up were tempted, some tempted by money and some by Paradise.
It is much harder for this generation than it was for my generation.
(woman in French) Violence is birthed by the economic dead ends that confront our youth who happen to be Muslim with an Islamic outlook.
How do you feel that we, as Americans, or how do we as a world culture start to end the fighting?
I believe that there is an enormous anger with American policy.
It's too bad it's the American people who have to pay for that anger.
And so we have the obligation not to fail our future, we have to reach out to each other, ignore official political lines and create unofficial bridges between civilian societies in order to bring about change.
What were your thoughts after 9/11 happened?
If it were truly Osama bin Laden, who did that, then he dealt us a bad hand.
He legitimized the American presence in the Middle East.
He was the reason for the adoption of all the anti-terrorist laws that have pushed us further under the yoke of our own local political leaders.
I was astonished on many levels.
It's horrible.
(beeping)
(beeping)
(Morgan) Osama bin Laden says one reason for the creation of Al-Qaeda and attacks against the West, is the existence of Israel,
America's support of her and the treatment of the Palestinian people.
If Osama cares about the Palestinians so much,
I wanted to see if the feeling was mutual.
If it is,
I'm sure someone can help me narrow in on it.
(Morgan) How do you feel about Al-Qaeda causing acts of terrorism
- in the name of the Palestinian people?
- I don't agree with Al-Qaeda.
Yeah.
I'll leave that alone.
I don't agree with them at all.
It is none of their business to do anything for us.
We can do for ourselves.
We are fighting to make our homeland free.
It's none of their business.
(Morgan) I was wondering if you could help?
Looking for Osama bin Laden.
- (man) Go to Tora Bora.
No.
- Not here in Ramallah?
- No?
- They hate Osama bin Laden.
- Palestinians?
- Palestinians.
- And you know, if...
- Why do they hate him?
Because he likes blood.
You know?
He is a ridiculous Muslim.
He gives a bad picture about Islam.
(Arabic hip-hop plays)
We've heard Hamas is on the same level as Al-Qaeda.
Is that true?
(in Arabic) Ours is not a religious conflict.
We don't fight the Jews because they are Jews.
No, we fight them because they occupy our lands.
And Al-Qaeda, it holds all of the West as an enemy.
But the number one reason they say they do it is because of the Palestinian conflict.
Because of what's happening here.
Any Arab leader, all Arab movements have adopted the Palestinian issue because they know the Palestinian issue is what triggers the emotions and nationalistic feelings in all Arab and Muslim people.
But, at the same point, they're using you guys as, like, this battle cry, but they're doing nothing to help you.
That's the reality.
Without the Palestinian issue, they won't get any attention on the global level.
It is strategic on their part to adopt the Palestinian issue.
(Morgan) Unbelievable how many walls are here, the separation.
Everywhere you go there's a wall, a fence, barbed wire.
It's not for a human being.
It's good for a zoo.
(in Arabic) If this was happening in Israel,
America and all the other countries would protest it.
- The peace of life, we don't have it.
- Yeah.
And we are living in very big prison.
(in Arabic) I wish we had somebody like Osama bin Laden in Palestine.
Just to destroy the state of Israel.
It's a political struggle, a military struggle.
But the biggest thing is this.
All of this is about land.
Scattered through the hills of the Palestinian West Bank, are Israeli settlements, built to expand the Jewish presence in the region.
How does it feel, being overlooked by settlements?
It's not only overlooking us, but we are always under their foot.
(in Arabic) They can come and take over my home, where I live, by force.
What can I do?
I can't do anything.
(man) Tears and blood were shed today as Israel began the forced evacuation of Jewish settlers from their homes.
(Morgan) The settlements are a cause of violence between settlers and Palestinians, they are also a contentious issue within Israeli politics.
With one side seeing the settlements as another obstacle in achieving peace, while the other sees it as a divine right.
We Jews are the rightful owner of this land.
- Mm-hmm.
- It was a land that was promised to them by the Almighty, who kept his promise and brought us back.
After we realized there's going to be a struggle about every centimeter of the land, we realized we have to settle on the outposts to enlarge the area.
This outpost, for instance, it's...
- So is that legal to do that?
- It's illegal in the moment, as it is in the process of being legalized.
(Morgan) What is your thought on the Palestinian conflict?
When we were kids, there was this game where you play music
- and there's a circle of chairs.
- Yeah.
Musical chairs.
Musical chairs.
This is a bit like a musical chair tragedy.
Somebody is left without a chair.
But everybody needs to sit somewhere.
(Morgan) Should Israelis move out of the settlements?
Israel'll have to let go of the territories.
We are not holding the territories, the territories are holding us.
The tragedy of this place is that everybody knows exactly what would be the solution in the end, the end of the story.
Two countries that are connected, but separated.
And this is the way it's going to end.
Every person in his right mind knows this is the way it's going to end.
One thing we don't know is how many people are going to die, and how much time is going to pass.
But the end is very clear.
- Yeah.
- That's tragic.
Are there politicians working towards a solution?
Yes, there are politicians who are working for peace.
The problem is, if you have three buses exploding in Tel Aviv,
- it will stop.
- Yeah.
And we can progress the peace process once again, and then if a settler in the territories will kill somebody, it will stop again.
And so, we're being held hostage by the extremists from both sides.
So this is basically Israel, and that's the Gaza Strip.
And...
It's pretty...
It's pretty scary.
It is really scary.
Imagine that rolling up over your hill, coming at your house.
Imagine living like this.
Imagine this is how you live every single day.
(explosion)
Oh, shit.
(woman) A Qassam touched down next to a daycare center in Sderot this morning.
No one was wounded in the attack, but the Hamas chief warned the rocket attacks on Israel will continue.
(Morgan) So this classroom was blown up about eight and a half hours ago.
Luckily, there were no kids in it.
Rocket came from the Gaza Strip.
If there had been kids in here, half of them would be dead.
You see this and get a sense of how wrong things are.
I can't imagine raising my kid up in a place like this.
I couldn't imagine living in a place where my kid went to school, and this is something that can happen every day.
(woman) I think everything's going pretty good with the pregnancy.
Thirty weeks, it's very active, and it's positioned the right way, and everything's good.
Take deep, full breaths into the belly.
I never imagined I would spend my pregnancy like this, separated from my partner, but, then again, before Morgan, I never thought I would have kids, so... (laughs)
You just never can tell, can you?
(siren wails)
Here with the Israeli Police Bomb Squad, they got a call.
Two calls, actually.
Going to check them out.
(siren wails)
- Is it right here?
- Yeah.
Right, few feet of us.
Let's go!
(in Hebrew) The suspicious object is here, past the garbage can.
(man in Hebrew) Listen up.
Good evening to everyone.
There is a suspicious object there.
I am asking everyone who is in this area of Allenby and the area of the boardwalk to move away from the area.
The man on the hotel balcony, get inside.
Everyone is requested to be behind the police gates.
Pay attention.
This is the bomb squad.
I am about to conduct a controlled explosion on the suspicious object.
(Morgan) It's so scary.
And this happens every day.
Eight to ten times a day, he said, sometimes up to 18.
Don't stand near the windows.
(man) Three... two... one.
Go.
There's a bikini inside.
(laughs) Oheck it out.
Well, my heart's pounding and it's a bikini. (laughs)
Nice job, pal.
You did good.
- (beeps)
- Good job, buddy.
No, come on.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
- (beeping)
- There'll be plenty more chances.
- (Morgan) Oan we ask you questions?
- (man) About what?
- About...
- Political?
- A little bit. (laughs)
- No, no.
I'd love to hear your thoughts on the current conflict.
It's all an illusion?
Yes.
Wow.
That guy is one of the greatest optimists I've ever seen.
How you doing?
Oan I ask you a couple of questions?
(splashing)
So somebody just threw a water balloon at us.
(man in Hebrew) Get the hell out of here!
And now there's a crowd gathering because they're going to chase us away.
They're gathering numbers now.
There's a big flock of people that's going to chase us.
- Go off!
- (man in Hebrew) Get out of here!
This is not your land.
I'm not allowed to talk to anybody in the country?
(man in Hebrew) Get the hell out of here!
- I'd say...
- Get out of here!
...we're not very wanted around here.
(in Hebrew) I'm going to break this.
This place is no joke.
We were down there just trying to talk to people.
So what you see here, majority of people here don't think like them.
Yeah, I think we've found enough peace here today.
Out of here, get out of here, get out of here!
It is...
It's no joke.
Go off!
Go off!
- I'm going to my car.
- Go off!
Dude.
- Yeah.
- Jewish?
I'm going to my car.
- No Jewish.
- (shouting)
There's so many things that are wrong on both sides.
If this was solved tomorrow, if, suddenly, there were two states, and people were living in peace, would bin Laden go away?
I don't think it would happen.
What you're doing, is you're taking an argument away.
It isn't.
It's messed up.
(shouting)
There goes my friend.
See you.
(Morgan) How hard is it for you to be in the minority in this region, a Ohristian in a Muslim country?
I have no problem whatsoever, living with the Muslims.
We are worshipping Allah.
And, uh, I am worshipping the same God, that the Ohristians and the Muslims and the Jews are worshipping.
The one God.
Religion is being used as a mask to hide the cruelty the ugliness of violence.
Moderates, they are the majority, but their voices are not loud enough.
(Morgan) What are your thoughts on the global war on terror?
9/11 breaks the hearts of every human being, but I think the best way is not to fight only.
You have to look for the root of the problem.
What our American brothers and friends need is a cultural strategy.
Without understanding each other, without this mutual respect, there's no peace.
It's impossible.
Mission is impossible.
(Morgan) Not only is it impossible, it's downright scary.
Just ask journalist Fouad Hussein.
Ten years ago while he was jailed for criticizing Jordars economic policies, he met Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq.
They remained pen pals up until Zarqawi was killed in 2006.
According to what Zarqawi told him,
America is playing right into Al-Qaeda's hands.
(in Arabic) Al-Qaeda attacked New York and Washington on September 11th.
Because Al-Qaeda can't fight the U.S. On its soil, they drew them to Arabic land so that they will fight them here.
(Morgan) Had we left Afghanistan and said "That's it."
You know, "We're done." What would have happened?
After Afghanistan, Al-Qaeda didn't have anywhere to operate.
If the United States hadrt entered Iraq,
Al-Qaeda wouldn't be the same as they are now.
It would have ended by the end of Afghanistan.
The psychology of the Arabs and Muslims is to side with whoever fights the occupier.
If bin Laden would be caught or killed right now,
- would it make any difference?
- Nothing.
Nothing whatsoever.
Zarqawi was killed and nothing happened.
And if bin Laden and Zawahiri got killed, nothing will happen.
Because Al-Qaeda has become an intercontinental idea, the same as globalization.
(Morgan) And that idea is reaching more and more people each day.
With Operation Special Delivery only seven weeks away,
I need to go back to the beginning.
And the beginning for Osama is Saudi Arabia.
Saudi Arabia is a country ruled by one family, and governed by one brand of fundamental Islam, Wahhabism.
Osama was born here.
He went to school here.
And, in the late '70s, he was radicalized here.
(man in Arabic) O God, one leader to lead jihad for your sake.
To liberate the land of Palestine.
And the land of Iraq from the Ohristians.
O God, the strong and noble one.
O God, go after the Ohristians.
O God, make wars in their homes.
O God, release your armies upon them.
O God, make the land of Palestine a graveyard for the Jews.
O God, make the land of Iraq a graveyard for the Ohristians.
(Morgan) Do you feel America is trying to fight a war against the religion of Islam?
(in Arabic) Well, look at what you did in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Well, they went to Afghanistan to get Osama bin Laden.
And the Taliban wouldn't give him up.
Was it an act of aggression or not?
We were seeking peace in Afghanistan.
You went there with an ambulance or with a tank?
(laughter)
That's a good question.
Do you think Osama bin Laden caused 9/11?
If one man in a cave was able to do this...
What if all Muslims were to resist against America under the leadership of one man?
See, but I don't think 1.2 billion Muslims think the same way you think.
One single verse from the Koran and they will come.
So why has no one said that verse yet?
These things get planned.
Don't disregard it as unlikely.
What if we were to burn the refineries, just to deprive you of the oil?
(Morgan) You said Saudi Arabia is a country divided.
What do you mean by that?
Not divided, but not yet building the national unity we are looking for.
One important issue in the Kingdom, is to organize the relation between the religious establishment and the political establishment.
This issue hasn't been resolved yet, and it must be resolved.
Otherwise, extremists, terrorists, may dictate some of their ideologies on us.
And we still have so many people, who are refusing to accept the reality.
Are there still radicals within the country?
We still have a lot.
And they are dangerous, by the way.
We should not underestimate the ability of the extremists.
Those people are ready to die.
Those people are ready to destroy.
Those people are ready to kill themselves, kill their families, they don't care about life.
Therefore, I think they are a threat us, in Saudi Arabia, then to other countries, then to the world.
(man) In an unprecedented nine month operation netting more than 170 Al-Qaeda suspects, and more than five million dollars,
Saudi intelligence officials say they thwarted plans to fly aircraft into oil facilities, attack security installations, kill senior officials and send money to Al-Qaeda in Iraq.
But the raids reveal a far more worrying trend for the Saudis.
The war in Iraq is spilling over into Saudi Arabia.
Right in front of the head office of the Mutawwa'un, the religious police, is Ohop Ohop Square.
I'm standing right on the drain where they...
(makes slicing noises) ...cut people's heads off, and the blood goes into that drain.
Everybody stands around and watches.
They kill people in the morning and then play soccer in the afternoons.
What a place.
(Morgan) It's complete culture shock for me to be in Saudi Arabia.
An absolute other world, from anything I've ever experienced, any place I've ever been.
We've been to Egypt and Morocco and Jordan, and the Palestinian territories, and these places are so progressive by comparison.
There is no separation of church and state.
Church is the state, state is the church.
The religion and the ideology is what runs everything.
Boys and girls separated from the time they're ten.
You can't see La Perla's brassiere ad.
That's wrong.
Oh, you can't see Posh Spice's shoulder.
You can't see the knee or the thigh.
- Oart I police my own thoughts?
- No.
(Morgan) That's the problem when a country's built entirely on marriage between church and state.
There isn't much room for moderates.
There's no freedom of speech or freedom of the press, speaking or writing anything critical of the royal family is illegal.
Public protest is actually forbidden.
The Ministry of Information monitors the Web for any immoral content, but websites supporting Al-Qaeda seem to get through just fine.
(Morgan) What do fundamentalists hope to achieve?
Power in the name of God.
That's where I don't like it.
They manipulate the Islamic teachings to fit different situations, different conditions,
- to, ultimately, lead them to power.
- Yeah.
I don't think a religious person, be it Ohristian, Jewish or Muslim, by his own upbringing and teaching, is qualified to be a public official.
He's just not.
Politics is completely different from religion.
I don't think any religious person is qualified to be a public official.
A good amount of secularism in every Arab political system is badly needed.
Drawing clear lines between where an lmam, a priest role, a responsibility ends, and a politician, or a public official's responsibility begins.
We need it for stability.
I'd love to hear your thoughts on Osama bin Laden.
Osama bin Laden, per se, is not the problem.
The school of thought, the followers, the teaching that he has planted in Islamic countries, in the Muslim world, is where the restructuring and the fight should begin.
It's unfortunate, but he is a product of the system, the establishment.
There's no denying that.
We have to accept that.
(Morgan) I went to a school to find what kids are being taught about the west.
(Morgan) These two young, open-minded, free-thinking students, picked by the administration, are the two I'm allowed to speak to.
Understanding that their teacher and principal be present the whole time.
(Morgan) How old are you guys?
(man in Arabic) Eighteen.
Eighteen, yeah.
So how is it being 18 in Saudi Arabia?
(in Arabic) Great.
We have no worries or troubles.
What did you learn about the United States while you were in school?
Actually, we did not study the United States specifically.
What's your opinion of the United States?
I have no definite opinion...
no specific opinion.
I'm just curious what you think about the U.S.
In the United States we hear one idea about Muslim countries,
Saudi Arabia is where the hijackers came from.
Saudi Arabia is the country that makes a lot of money off of oil.
So I'm curious what you guys hear about the United States.
No answer.
You have no answer?
No?
How about you?
Their view is...
Americans always want to dominate...
No, that was the wrong answer...
One of the things we hear a lot in the United States, is that there's a lot of anti-Western, or anti-Semitic things taught in school.
What are you taught about Israel?
(man in Arabic) Stop your cameras.
- What's wrong?
I'm sorry?
- They want to stop.
- They want to stop the whole thing?
- Yes.
OK. (laughs)
How are you to have a discussion, if he can't talk about things?
How are things supposed to change if you can't address them?
Excuse me, I was wondering if we could ask you a question?
Excuse me, I was wondering if you guys could help me?
No?
Oould I ask you guys a question?
No?
Do you know anybody who could get me in touch with Osama bin Laden?
Osama bin Laden?
(in Arabic) No, I have no leads.
It's becoming more obvious, Osama never went to the mall.
- So this is a good moisturizer?
- (woman) Yeah.
- It'll keep my hands really soft?
- Yeah.
- Where can I find Osama bin Laden?
- What?
- You saw him?
- Yes.
Do you know which aisle he was in?
- (laughing)
- Was he down past the Nutella?
Is he in Saudi Arabia?
- Maybe.
- Maybe.
OK.
Maybe you can ask his family.
Maybe they can help you.
- OK.
All right.
- Yeah.
- Oool, I'll do that.
Thanks.
Bye.
- OK.
Bye.
It's a great suggestion.
I'm going to talk to his family.
OK, this is the Bin Laden Aviation Agency.
How fitting, right?
That's terrible.
Look, I'm not lying.
Right there.
There's the Bin Laden Aviation Agency.
(in Arabic) Where can I marry Osama bin Laden?
- Oh, you don't know?
- (woman) I don't.
(man) Please make sure that you have the correct number.
Your call cannot be completed as dialed.
After 9/11, wouldn't you change your number if your last name was bin Laden?
That probably would have been the very first thing I would have done.
I would have been like, "God, Osama, you asshole.
Now I got to change all my phone numbers."
(Morgan) There's a window right there.
(man in Arabic) We would like to ask you some questions about Osama bin Laden.
Yeah.
We're looking for anything.
A phone number, any information we could get.
Anything anybody may know.
He's like, "Do you think he's here?"
I said, "He's not here?" He goes, "Maybe." Maybe!
- He's in the basement.
- Maybe he's in the basement.
I'm looking for Osama bin Laden.
- (laughing)
- Why is that funny?
Why is that funny?
What's wrong with that?
- Where is your car?
- Where is my car?
Why, you going to blow it up or something?
You want to see it?
(Morgan) We're going up to bin Laders farm.
We're going to go to his place, this house that he built with his own hands.
We're going to talk to people in the village, see if somebody can get me in.
(speaking Arabic)
- (Morgan) That guy said this was it.
- (man) Yeah.
- Not much of a farm.
Look at this.
- Yeah.
It's like a trailer park.
This must be the house.
Let's go.
Let's get out of here.
Man, I should have bought some sandals.
(Morgan) Well, I didn't find OBL, or any good clues in the desert of Saudi Arabia.
But that night I did find Othman Ya al Bari, who's related to one of the 9/11 hijackers.
Hopefully, he could point me in the right direction.
He's got professional wrestling on TV, he knows what's good, see?
One of your relatives was said to be one of the hijackers.
- (in Arabic) Yes.
- Yeah.
Was he?
No.
After 9/11, there was video of a lot of the hijackers.
A lot of them released video statements.
Do you not think that connects them in some way to what happened?
I don't believe that is solid proof.
America wins all the Oscar awards.
It owns the best studios and technologies in the world.
We've seen the animals, the lion, the dog and the pig, we've seen them in many movies talking like humans.
I feel very uncomfortable with this conversation.
What do you think would drive some people towards wanting to join a group like Al-Qaeda?
What would make them want to go off and fight, possibly lose their lives?
They go because they feel like America... you feel like...
She's trying all kinds of ways to dominate and impose her dominance on the entire world, especially on the Muslim world.
Have you had friends who have gone off to wage jihad?
Yes, of course.
Where did they go?
These youth went first to Afghanistan.
Then America went into Iraq, and they followed.
How many people do you know that went?
- A lot.
- (man) A lot.
And how many have come back?
Unfortunately, nobody came back.
(beeping)
(Morgan) Afghanistan is a country at war for more than 30 years, and it feels like it.
From when the Soviet Union invaded, to civil war, to the Taliban, and now the arrival of U.S. And NATO forces, its impact is everywhere.
Wherever you go there's barricades, barbed wire, people with guns, checkpoints, more people with guns.
And, in the middle of all this, is just this incredible poverty.
I thought the first place to look in Afghanistan for Osama was the last place that he was seen.
So we're heading out to Tora Bora.
They say, "No, no, it's not dangerous at all,"
yet there's 21 guys here with guns...
(laughs) taking us to Tora Bora.
"No, it's fine.
You're not gonna need to worry about it at all."
(Arabic music plays)
Are there a lot of landmines in this area?
(in foreign language) No, not on the path...
- Really?
- Really.
OK.
(Morgan) So, this area here, this was the beginning of Al-Qaeda's base?
(man in Arabic) This is where Osama's headquarters was.
There are large caves on this side and the other side too.
They were full of ammunition, weapons, and food such as tea, sugar and rice.
Look, up there, should we go?
One of our soldiers is shaking the nuts off the tree, 'cause, apparently, if you eat 20 of these nuts...
All night long.
It's the word on the street.
You can rock and roll all night.
Look at that, we got a guy up in the tree to get the magic nuts.
Dude, look at that.
While these guys are playing with their nuts, I think I'll head out on my own.
President Bush said that he wanted to capture Osama bin Laden dead or alive.
The U.S. Had its best chance in late November of 2001, when elements of both Afghan and American forces closed in on Osama's mountain hideout.
The following days saw some of the heaviest fighting in all of the war.
Yoo-hoo!
Osama!
And, rather than commit additional U.S. Ground forces, the U.S. Chose to rely on local Afghan fighters to bring in OBL.
When the dust had settled, Osama was gone.
The governor of the province has ideas how to bring the excitement back.
(in foreign language) Our plan and goal is that Tora Bora should become an international tourism center.
So we want to build a grand amusement park in Tora Bora.
What kind of rides?
Everything will be built.
Maybe a roller coaster.
Everything will be built.
- Water slides?
- Absolutely.
- Ferris wheels?
All of it?
- Yes.
Yes.
You could say, "Tora Bora.
It's the bomb."
(crickets chirping)
(Morgan) I'm not sure how much fun Afghanistan is ready for.
Seems to me they could use a lot more than just roller coasters around here.
(in foreign language) No one has done anything for us.
All the international aid goes to those at the top.
It never makes its way down to us.
You got a tent from the UN.
No, we bought it in the black market!
- No, we buy it in the black market.
- (laughing)
They haven't helped us with land, money or to fix our tent or anything.
Look at this troublemaker!
When we're traveling at night, we have to constantly check the camel to make sure we didn't leave him somewhere.
Have you left him behind before?
Yeah, all the time!
We've lost them many times!
Our lives already passed.
We are concerned about our children.
They should be able to have a better life.
(man) The international community is failing to help this country get on its feet.
Organizations such as USA gauge success by how much money they spend.
Not by what it achieves.
The bigger budget they have, the more impressed they are.
The fact that it doesn't achieve anything, all the clinics don't exist, no one seems to care back in the States, that information doesn't get there.
(in foreign language) No one is helping this place, and if there is, no one is distributing it.
There are more than 800 houses here but no school or hospital.
We are living the same now as we were under the Taliban.
America must hold our government accountable.
America must ask why didn't you pave the streets with the money we gave you.
All those houses were destroyed by foreign countries.
Why don't they rebuild those houses?
They haven't done anything positive here.
Two years ago, the U.S. Ambassador came here and said,
"We're going to make a pledge to rebuild the school." It's been two years.
Look at this place.
This is hearts and minds.
It looks like a bomb went off yesterday.
There's bullet holes.
The front of the building is riddled with bullet holes.
Blast holes.
Nothing's being done.
We've got to do something for these kids.
We've gotta do something for these kids to say, "Somebody cares about us.
Somebody cares about us getting educated.
Somebody wants us to be in a safe environment."
(Morgan) As somebody about to become a father for the first time, it's so instilling in me, reminding me, of the things that I want for my family.
I don't ever want my child to be in a position where they can't be educated.
Or can't feel like they can better themselves, like that this is it.
That this is as good as it gets for their life, and to not have hope that tomorrow is going to be better.
- (phone ringing)
- Ow.
- (phone ringing)
- Ow.
Man, this baby starts kicking as soon as your phone rings.
- Baby knew I was calling.
- We miss you.
Baby knew.
Ow!
- Oh, I miss you so much.
- Yeah.
Me, too.
(Morgan) I dreamt we had a girl last night.
(woman) That's cute.
(Morgan) Ever see Osama bin Laden around here?
(in foreign language) God know, if we catch him, we will tear him apart.
Osama bin Laders Afghars enemies.
(in foreign language) Who is Osama?
He is the one who destroyed those buildings in America.
Fuck him.
And fuck America.
I'm looking for Osama bin Laden.
- Pakistan.
- Pakistan?
- Pakistan.
- OK!
Pakistan?
Pakistan.
(in foreign language) It is very obvious to the world that he is hiding in Pakistan.
You should find him so we have peace in the world.
(Morgan) I'm looking for Osama bin Laden.
(in foreign language) Tribal area.
Near Peshawar?
(heart beat on speaker)
That is so cool.
I love you so much.
I love you too, baby.
(imitating heartbeat)
That was my baby's little disco heartbeat.
What will happen if I go to Pakistan to look for him?
(in foreign language) You will find him.
I will find him?
You want to come look for him with me?
No?
(laughing)
Why not?
I'll miss my family.
- (man) I'm gonna miss my family.
- You'll miss your family.
I miss my family very much.
If I went into the tribal area, you think I'd be OK?
(in foreign language) God knows what will happen if you go there.
Something terrible will happen to you.
You're finished.
The Taliban will cut your head.
- They'll cut my head?
Yeah.
- Yeah.
Ugh!
So Alex started getting contractions last night.
Braxton Hicks contractions, which aren't real contractions, but it's your body preparing for a contraction.
And, here I am, missing it all.
And, here I am, missing it all.
Missing it all, man, missing it all.
(man singing in Arabic)
(Morgan) Wejust found out from U.S. Military that we can go out on an embed.
And it's frightening.
But the most important thing, for me, is to try and, hopefully, just narrow down the path to finding the most wanted man on the planet.
How much they're actually looking for this guy, who knows?
But we'll find out.
This stuff is so heavy.
Everything in your body tells you you shouldn't be going to a job, or doing something where you gotta wear a bulletproof vest.
(man) The next thing you'll see here in America you'll see terrorism.
If you don't think you'll see, you're blinding yourself to the historic development of everything taking place on this earth.
Terrorism.
Terrorism.
(man) First of all, I'd like to welcome all of you guys to Firebase Apache.
- What questions do you have?
- Will we be able to speak to any of the people in the area who actually live in the local villages?
Um, when you go out to 4-2, yeah.
- There's a village right next to them.
- OK.
And that village also happens to be full of Taliban.
(woman) I'd like to remind you, while talking about going outside the wire.
When whoever we're with, whoever's escorting us says, "Let's go,"
get in the vehicle and go.
It doesn't mean finish your question.
It means go now.
(Leppert) This is hardcore Taliban country, let me tell you.
Over those mountains, that's Afghanistan.
If you go over those mountains, that's Pakistan.
We're centrally located with a lot of activity around us.
(Morgan) Will we stop in a village tomorrow?
- Yes, we will.
- What's the plan for the afternoon?
We're fogbound, we'll test fire weapons, talk, whatever you want.
You've got free rein.
I had a lot of grouping right beside the guy.
Well, if nothing else, it scared the hell out of him.
Oan I try a rocket launcher?
(laughing) That was awesome.
You've been here six months.
You might be able to tell me.
Where is Osama bin Laden?
(Leppert) We ask that every time we go out.
"Hey?
You guys know where Osama's at?" They always point up to the mountains.
(in foreign language) Where's Osama?
(laughter)
- (Morgan) Where's Osama bin Laden?
- I have no clue.
Is he alive?
Even if he was, I don't think we'd know.
We are going to stop and speak to villagers.
They said I should write my blood type on anything that'd be attached to me.
Scary as shit, man.
What we're concentrating on is your security.
That's it.
In a firefight I'm going to come in.
Oome to this effect, bring you in and we'll grab you to here.
As soon as I do, I'm going to try to grab you again.
As soon as it's safe, then we're going to move out.
When we go out, we expect to have contact.
We expect to get shot at.
Anything goes out there.
We always got to be ready for everything.
(man) This is what we call a "friendly village."
(laughter)
(man) Once they understand it's their choice to talk, the forces will stand back.
And then whoever wants to talk to you will talk to you.
(man) Morgan, come up, let's introduce you.
Yes, sir.
(in foreign language) This person is a civilian from America and wants to ask you some questions.
His name is Morgan.
(Morgan) I was hoping you could tell me your thoughts on the Taliban and the current conflict happening.
(in foreign language) What do you think, who is happy with battles?
No one is happy with battles.
We are not happy.
We don't like the war.
We want a peaceful life.
We are neither your friends nor the Talibars.
We just want a simple life.
What are things, when you look at your village, you need the most?
In terms of assistance.
The most important problem is the lack of water.
Before the base drilled their well we didn't have any water problems.
- What do you think of Osama bin Laden?
- (man) Morgan!
Let's go now!
Now!
- Oome on!
- Let's go now!
(man on radio) Be advised, I've just been informed of an ambush, possibly the governor's convoy.
(man 2) And we are in pursuit of two individuals on foot.
Jedi-1, we're at 2-0-6.
That village to our left is where the Taliban went to.
We have one downed Taliban.
We have their motorcycle in our possession.
Over.
(Morgan) People have said Afghanistan is a winnable war.
What are your thoughts?
In counter-insurgency, killing doesn't work.
Got to work on the center of gravity, the people.
They like having clean water, having a medical clinic.
They like seeing their kids go to school.
Itjust makes it more difficult for the Taliban to change the tide and get the people to go to the other side.
(in foreign language) Thank you and please tell your commander the father of Taza Gui says peace.
(Morgan) What would have happened if we had sent more troops here in 2002?
You would have killed more Taliban, but, I mean, we're killing a lot of Taliban right now.
And they've got the open sieve from the madrassas of Pakistan in the refugee camps that go to these young kids who don't have a job, who have no positive outlook in life.
They sell them with a lot of propaganda.
Tell them they're going to give their family money, bring them here.
- Where is Osama?
- I think he's in Pakistan.
(beeping)
I think it's quite likely that Osama bin Laden is in Pakistan.
(woman) The latest intelligence has always seemed to indicate that he is in Pakistan.
(man) He's probably somewhere along that border region.
- Pakistan.
- Along that border.
Tribal areas of Pakistan.
Senior leadership, number one and two are there.
On the Pakistan border it's particularly dangerous, a region where terror rules.
And where many believe Osama bin Laden could be hiding.
Everyone I've spoken to said this is where Osama's hiding out.
(Morgan) Everyone, that is, except for Pakistanis.
- Where is Osama?
- (Morgan) You tell me.
- Where is Osama?
- I'm looking for him.
You tell me.
(in foreign language) He's in Afghanistan.
Osama bin Laden is here.
Afghanistan.
Osama bin Laden...
Which animal is that?
I don't where he is, but it's also a question if he's alive or dead.
But, um, his influence is here.
(in foreign language) He is a great soldier of the Muslims.
He is fighting for righteousness.
He's a diamond.
Osama is exploiting the root causes.
If we find the root causes, we'll solve everything.
- Osama bin Laden is nothing, sir.
- He is only one!
One person!
Dude, look at that.
Even in Pakistan they love wrestling.
- All the people like the wrestling.
- Tell me why you like wrestling.
- Because wrestling is fair.
- Oan I let you in on a little secret?
- It's fixed.
- Fixed?
- Fixed.
It's not real.
- Maybe.
- You are right.
I know.
You are right.
- OK.
Good.
But when it is for a belt, then it is not fixed.
I'm looking, uh...
How are you?
How are you?
Hi.
I'm just looking... (Morgan) Just based on what everybody has said, I got to think we're within a couple hundred miles of where he is.
Maybe even less.
Yeah, OK.
OK.
Thank you.
Tomorrow we're heading into this area of the tribal regions, just past Peshawar, where everyone has told me Osama bin Laden is.
I mean, I have no idea what to expect when I get there.
I've been traveling for months to try and find this person that everybody we talk to...
You know, they all say,
"Why are you looking for this person?
What is he?
He's one man?"
The thing that I've realized is that this whole trip is a chance to actually go out and see and talk to those people that we're told to be so scared of all the time.
I'm not somebody who thinks we can sit around the campfire and sing Kumbaya, you know?
That's ridiculous.
(laughing)
But I believe that we create these demons within ourselves.
And we create these demons within the media.
And we create these visions that are so beyond reality.
They start feeding themselves after a while.
Our fearjust becomes exponential.
They say when you go looking for trouble, you'll find it.
It's not that I'm looking for trouble.
I'm just looking for answers.
And I think I've found a lot.
I think I've found a lot on this trip.
"Attention.
Entry of foreigners is prohibited beyond this point."
Even if I go over the border to find Osama, it's not going to, suddenly, make the world safer for my kid.
The things that are pushing people to follow him and his ideas are still going to be there.
And that's what we have to change.
I think that we need to take a step back and really ask ourselves, "What kind of a world do we want to live in?
What do we want that world to be?"
It's not won'th it.
So her waterjust broke, which is very exciting.
So, I'm that much closer.
- OK.
- OK?
You want to get up?
(Alex groaning)
(laughter)
(woman) It's your son!
- (Morgan) It's a boy!
- (Alex) We have a baby boy!
- We have a baby boy.
- Oh, my God!
He's beautiful.
- (crying) - (laughter)
(Morgan) So, I didn't end up finding Osama.
What I did find, is that there are a lot more people out there who arejust like us, than there are who arejust like him.
I'll always bet on the billions of regular people to win over the crazies.
After all, we all want the same things for our families.
We want the world to be a place where we can raise and love our kids.
Where they can have everything they need to be happy, healthy, without it blowing up around them.
It's not going to be easy.
And all that reward money sure would have helped but, hey, you know what?
He's going to love public school.
(What's so Funny 'Bout) Peace Love and Understanding)
"Man, life is good.
I mean, it just can't get any better than this. "
It's all beautiful and perfect and wonderful and amazing, and then, one day, that one thing happens that changes everything.
[bomb whistling]
- I'm pregnant.
- [man] That's only one test.
[man sighs] Oh, boy.
[Morgan] What kind of a world am I bringing a kid into?
They say the most important job a father has is to keep his baby safe.
But how am I going to do that?
I can cover the electrical sockets, or childproof Mommy's pill bottles, but that's just inside the house.
- What about out there?
- [sirens wailing]
There's cults, muggers, drugs, violence.
Not to mention all of the predators now lurking about.
I could move from the East Village to a family friendly neighborhood in Brooklyn, but is that enough to keep my child safe?
- And what about the big things?
- [thunder rumbles]
Things like hurricanes, earthquakes or tsunamis?
And that's just that mean, old, Mother Nature.
What about the really big things?
Things we should really be afraid of.
Like the most wanted man on the planet.
What about him?
We've got the strongest military, sneakiest spies and coolest technology in the entire world, but we can't find one man hiding in
Afghanibaluchapakiwaziristan?
[ MC Hammer:
U Can't Touch This]
[man] After 9/1 1, I thought some satellite would shoot a laser down onto the earth, fry up an omelet bin Laden and save us all.
But that wasn't the case.
I know, maybe he's dead.
But maybe he's alive.
Maybe he's on dialysis.
Maybe he's a nine foot bionic ninja with X-ray vision and the power of flight.
All I know is that in the last six years, there've been more acts of terrorism, worldwide, than in 20 years leading up to it.
Today, there are known terrorist cells in more than 100 countries around the world.
By the time my kid's out of diapers, everyone's gonna be a terrorist.
Nowhere's gonna be safe.
With Operation Special Delivery only 1 9 weeks away,
I just can't sit around and do nothing.
If the CIA and the FBI can't find him, and I'm going to make this world safe for my child, it's time for a new plan.
If I've learned anything from big budget action movies, it's that complicated global problems are best solved by one lonely guy crazy enough to think he can fix everything before the credits roll.
And I'm going to find out once and for all:
Where in the world is Osama bin Laden?
[ Jon Spurney:
Where in the World is Osama bin Laden?
]
[all hollering]
[hooting]
Moustache ride.
Reign of Terror!
I'm gonna get you, Osama been hiding.
[Morgan] I wanted to talk to you because I'm getting ready to do a lot of travel.
I wanted to see if I'm going to need any shots, anything...
Where are you going to be going?
We're going to go look for Osama bin Laden.
OK. [laughs] You'll probably find him.
Um, you're going to need a whole bunch of shots and prescriptions.
- You want to do it, want to go for it?
- I'm going to need it all, right?
- How many shots am I getting?
- Diphtheria, tetanus, polio.
Typhoid, meningitis, hepatitis A and B.
This one I must tell you about.
This is your yellow fever.
About one in one million people who get the yellow fever shot, get a very, very bad reaction.
They get multi-system organ failure.
There are six reported cases or more, maybe seven or eight.
And about four of them died.
[Morgan] Going to need more than shots to keep me safe in the places I'm heading to.
[man] This is reality-based personal protection, teaching you how to survive explosions, small arms attacks, sniper attacks, chemical attacks.
We cover it all.
We're going to simulate a hand grenade attack.
Boom!
You would have been killed.
I'll show you how to survive.
The first thing you want to do is turn away from the grenade and dive.
You're in a perfect position.
This is going to save your life by 98 percent.
When someone's head explodes, that's what it looks like.
Even though it's tragic, we can't focus on this, we got to think about survival.
Look at the wall there.
What do you see?
- [Morgan] I see blood.
- [Wagner] OK, good.
We have the "blood splatter."
How do we determine where the sniper is at, based on our situation here?
Hold up a hat on a stick.
If I'm in a restaurant, I don't want to sit in the middle.
If a gunman came, where is he most likely to hit?
You're dead here.
This is what we call the "fatal funnel."
You want to stay behind that line, you want to stay off the wall.
You're dead here.
You're dead here.
Any time you leave your vehicle, you gotta assume, in dangerous places, someone could plant a bomb on your vehicle.
You're dead here.
- [both laughing]
- You're dead here.
Here's what I recommend, you go around the corner, and then you can pull it open, and if it doesn't go boom, you can go check it out.
Gonna be the most paranoid person in the Middle East.
Maybe that's a good thing.
Because if I'm going to find Osama,
I'm traveling to scary places.
In the last year, the State Department issued over 100 warnings about traveling to the Middle East.
Mainly because Americans are now bigger targets for kidnapping and murder.
[Wagner] Now we're going to have a little classroom time about kidnapping.
Here are some basics of surviving as a hostage.
You got to accept it and start planning on how you're going to survive it.
Speak only if spoken to.
- Is this the crew's, the cameraman's?
- No.
[Wagner] Don't provoke the captors.
Don't stare at them.
Don't have a harsh tone of voice.
Don't be argumentative.
Don't have an attitude.
These people are in control, not you.
[man] This is not a fucking game.
[Wagner] Especially when you're in Baghdad, Kabul, or you're in Turkey, this stuff is going on daily, and you gotta be prepared for it.
I'm usually a pretty calm person when it comes to crazy shit happening around me.
But that's a whole other level of crazy.
[guitar riffs play]
We wage a war to save a civilization itself.
[guitar riffs play]
They hate us, our country.
They hate the liberties for which we stand.
[guitar riffs play]
Until you catch the chicken, you don't have the chicken.
- Go, go, go!
- [ Jon Spurney:
No Pain, No Gain]
Want you to get used to the sound of the language.
- [both making consonant sounds]
- Oh, good, Wow.
Go for the eyes.
The eyes!
Are you going to convert to Muslim or not?
Shoot him, shoot him.
I recommend you wear the clothes.
Maybe you can hit the tanning salon a little bit.
- [shots firing] - [yelling]
- Grenade!
- [screaming]
Somebody said I should grow my beard out?
Yeah, for you.
Because you obviously look very foreign.
- Look at this area.
Much bigger, right?
- This guy is probably alive.
[speaking foreign language]
You could have a situation where a device explodes and it gets on you.
Oh, fuck!
I brought you these outfits.
Hopefully, it keeps you safe.
This is a normal reaction.
He's fine.
How do I say, "Don't take me, take the cameraman?"
He's alive!
You have to know the way an Islamic terrorist thinks.
[Morgan] Jim's right.
I need to learn how Osama thinks.
To find a fox, you need to think like a fox.
I need to get inside his head and learn what makes him tick.
I need to explore the world he comes from.
Meet the people who influenced him.
Visit the places that shaped him into who he is today.
And, most of all, I need to try to understand what drives an Osama bin Laden to begin with.
I know just the place to start.
[beeping]
[ Malik Audouane:
Theme from Shaft]
Egypt is the birthplace of one of the heaviest hitters in the world of terrorism.
Ayman Al-Zawahiri.
He's Al-Qaeda's Team Manager and Osama's personal mentor.
His stats are pretty impressive.
He was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood at the age of 14.
He's a life-long follower of Sayyid Qutb, the man credited with creating modern day Islamic fundamentalism, is currently the number two of Al-Qaeda, and he's a Gemini.
And I got a tip where to find his uncle, Mahfouz Azzam.
If he can tell me where the A-man is, odds are Osama won't be too far away.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Mahfouz?
[speaks Arabic]
- It's nice to see you.
Welcome.
- Nice to see you.
- Thank you.
- Please.
- It's a beautiful day today.
Very nice.
- Yeah.
- [Morgan] So do you know where he is?
- [man in Arabic] No.
Where do you think he is?
[in Arabic] If you learn where he is, I beg you, let me know.
I just want to make sure he is OK.
He won't let me know by phone because you kill people with the phone.
The Russians killed the president of Chechnya with the phone, and you Americans have killed people with the phone.
This, a telephone, has become a lethal weapon!
And every month my bank account gets killed by my phone.
- [laughing]
- Which makes it even worse.
So, if you knew where he was, you wouldn't turn him in for the $25,000,000?
[laughs]
I would like to tell you something, the hungry who cannot find bread to eat in Afghanistan they wouldn't accept these $25 million of yours to turn in a Muslim they know is waging jihad for them.
So he's in Afghanistan?
- You say so.
- You said so.
You just told me.
America says so.
America says so.
- Do you think he's in Afghanistan?
- America says.
So if Al-Zawahiri and Osama bin Laden just disappeared tomorrow, would things change?
The seed that was sown by America, a seed of spitefulness, hate, aggression and killing, cannot disappear in the short term.
There has to be another foreign policy to uproot this seed.
[Morgan] It's easy to criticize American foreign policy, with the second most wanted terrorist in the family.
I should find regular folks who might be more objective.
What do you guys hear about Americans?
[in Arabic] The Americans are known to be fighting the Egyptians, Palestinians and Iraqis.
- We're fighting you?
- [laughing]
- Yes.
- Really?
I didn't even know that.
What are we fighting the Egyptians for?
[speaking Arabic]
You want to occupy Egypt.
[Morgan] Do we?
Why?
We're not that well versed in politics but that's what we hear on TV and stuff.
What do you think about America?
[in Arabic] They are good people, but we reject the American foreign policy.
[Morgan] How can he be against American foreign policy?
Egypt is one of our best friends in the region and in the global war on terror.
At the same time, it was home to five of the founding fathers of Al-Qaeda.
The guy who tried to blow up the World Trade Center in '93, and the ringleader of the 9/1 1 hijackings.
Maybe university students could tell me why Osama's making so many friends here.
It's about oppression, because Egypt is a developing country, so, like, the people who are oppressed are kind of more...
So it develops more terrorists, and that's it.
[in Arabic] These would be the minority, the rotten type.
Every society has the same.
Every society has good and bad.
In Egypt, people have no freedom.
And they try and prove to the government that they have freedom, deserve freedom, by committing terrorist attacks.
Did you vote in the last presidential election?
- No.
- No.
- You weren't old enough yet?
- It's not that.
I don't believe in it.
I know it's rigged.
I know that Hosni Mubarak would have won anyway.
They call this a democratic country, but it's not.
In Egypt, if a president wants to stay in power, he'll stay in power.
[applause]
[Morgan] And Hosni Mubarak has been in power for more than 26 years.
The United States has got a close and meaningful relationship with Egypt.
[cheering]
This relationship is a cornerstone for our policy in the Middle East.
[Morgan] Policy that includes giving Mubarak an aid package, while looking the other way as he uses riot police and hired thugs armed with sticks, knives, swords and Molotov cocktails to keep the opposition from voting on election day.
You might say about Mubarak the same thing FDR said about another dictator.
He may be a son of a bitch, but he's our son of a bitch.
[Morgan] See, we've had a policy of propping up dictators for more than 50 years now.
When the Cold War started heating up, we decided to do what it took to stop communism from taking over.
And the United States started mixing with a rougher crowd.
Hmm!
In 1 953, the CIA helped the Shah of Iran overthrow the Iranian government, to become their supreme ruler.
Sure, the Shah tortured or killed anyone who publicly disagreed with him.
Even went as far as shoving broken glass up the nether regions of critics.
But he totally hated Communism.
Now, he was a son of a bitch, but he was our son of a bitch.
The Shah kept Iran in our corner until 1 979, when Ayatollah Khomeini's Islamic revolution swept to power, and held 52 Americans hostage for 15 months.
That's when we made friends with Saddam Hussein over in Iraq.
Now, he was an SOB too, but for ten years, while he was fighting the Iranians, he was our SOB.
In fact, by the mid-'80s, we had sons of bitches all the way from Latin America to the Middle East, but, hey, pimping freedom ain't easy.
[hip-hop music plays]
[Morgan] We needed to keep our SOBs happy and on our side.
So we provided them with tanks, guns, planes and more money.
Today we give Egypt more than 2 billion dollars a year in weapons and aid.
Sure, there's torture, murder and rampant political corruption, but somewhere along the way we decided that, in order to protect our own freedom, it was all right to sacrifice the freedom of others.
Does lack of democracy, human rights, in countries like Egypt encourage people to get involved in extremist radical groups?
Of course.
There's no doubt about this.
It's the one thing that I agree with George W. Bush about.
That people join terrorist organizations because there is no other way to be active.
The threat of terrorism created the climate of fear that is being exploited by the Mubarak regime and by George Bush.
We're going through a very difficult time now.
I mean, we have terrorists on one side, and opportunist, exploitative regimes on the other side.
The U.S. can no longer claim the moral ground.
People have learned to expect a lot less from the U.S. than they used to.
[Arabic music plays]
[man in Arabic] The United States is the main problem in the region, frankly.
We love the American people, but we hate the American government.
[in Arabic] We pray to God to destroy you because of what's happening.
[Morgan] America's filled with people who want people to live peacefully, to co-exist together, just like me.
OK, I don't want you to be there when it happens.
Have a smell.
[Morgan] You know, being in the States, all we get on the news are the crazy nuts that like to scream, "Death to you!"
And so you're like, "Oh, man.
Go get them."
But we've been in Egypt for a week now, talking to people, who are real people, just like you and me.
One after another after another everybody said,
"This government's corrupt and it's backed by the U. S. "
- [chanting]
- It's hard for me to see how damaged the image of the country that I love and care about has become.
[phone rings]
- [Morgan] Hello?
- I got your postcard from Egypt today.
Oh, nice.
You sound good.
I am good.
Just promise you'll be here when it's really important.
OK?
I promise.
[woman] He has to be back by the first week of November, because I'm due the end of November, early December.
And, if he misses that, I'm going to be so upset.
And he's going to be upset.
But, also, he's going to these places that are so dangerous.
And I don't want him to miss anything.
And I don't want him to get hurt.
[man singing in Arabic] [man in Arabic] While we are living in these troubled times, we need to be merciful.
So get mercy through praises and prayers upon Him because He is mercy.
And He puts compassion in your heart.
As a Muslim I am taught that God has honored humankind.
He did not say he honored Muslims and everyone else is a second class citizen.
[speaking Arabic] We have honored the children of heaven.
[singing in Arabic]
[man] Your average Egyptian's struggling like your average American to make ends meet, to get a decent job, provide for his family, educate his kids.
The same concerns all over.
[Morgan] Torek is an Egyptian-American studying law at Al Azhar University.
He's a new dad and wants the world's view of Islam to change for the sake of his young son.
[Torek] We need to rectify this,
Muslims are over one fifth of the world population.
That's a lot of people.
It's not some Polynesian island somewhere.
- [Morgan laughs]
- That's a lot of people!
If four-fifths of the world are scared of one-fifth, what kind of civilization and humanity are we gonna have?
- [laughing] - [speaking Arabic]
Now they're going to think all we do is pray.
- Even the kids!
- I'm working on the voice-over.
From a very young age, they start manipulating the children.
[laughing]
[Torek] We need to differentiate between extreme factions in a population, and the regular, vast majority of people.
What do you think of the War on Terror?
It's a bogus term.
I don't think it means anything.
I think some guy that had too much to drink in the Pentagon, one night, came up with that.
- Dude, I got a great idea.
- A war on terrorism.
We had a war on drugs.
We didn't win that, either.
[Torek] But is it really a war on terror?
Have we eradicated terror?
Or are we exporting terror?
I think that...
Unfortunately, I think that we're exporting it.
I think that we lit the flame on a bomb.
[Morgan] The bomb Torek is speaking of is the explosive rise in terrorist attacks during the last seven years.
Al-Qaeda has now become a global franchise, serving up an unhealthy dose of j ihad to more and more people each year.
Ooh!
Can I help you?
[Morgan] Despite the U. S. spending over $500 billion fighting the war on terror,
Al-Qaeda continues to find new markets to expand into.
Thanks to heavy worldwide recruitment, which included having interested people filling out job applications, AQ is now back to its pre-9/1 1 strength.
Two of the U. S. 's closest allies, Spain and England, were both attacked by homegrown Al-Qaeda cells.
Even Muslim countries are finding they are in Al-Qaeda's crosshairs, often becoming the victims of terrorism and feeling the influence of Osama bin Laden firsthand.
[Arabic music plays]
[Morgan] Where is Osama bin Laden?
[in Arabic] He might be somewhere here in Morocco.
[in Arabic] How should I know?
- Bin Laden?
I am not a politic man.
- Yeah.
I don't know nothing about...
I'm a carpet dealer.
I sell carpet.
[Morgan] How many years has this tannery been here?
[in Arabic] Centuries.
What do you think about people who cause violence in the name of Islam?
[in Arabic] It is not from Islam to kill innocent people or to blow yourself up.
I'm disgusted by that.
[Morgan] Do you ever worry that your sons may get involved with terrorists?
We worry about that.
We don't want them to get involved with that kind of crowd.
That's why we have to take care of them financially.
[man in Arabic] Americans are causing all the trouble in the world.
But...
Were the...
But this is my opinion of the American government, not the American people.
[in Arabic] These are all the problems that Bush created.
I heard that they want to eradicate Islam.
[Morgan] What do you think about Osama bin Laden?
[speaking Arabic]
[Morgan laughs] He's crazy?
[in Arabic] Osama bin Laden, look how many people he's killed, how many have died.
And what has he accomplished?
He's accomplished a wave of suicide bombings in Morocco killing more than 50 people over the last four years.
The first attack was in May of 2003, when recruiters outside the country came to town and convinced 14 young men to blow themselves up in exchange for money and the rewards of paradise.
They all grew up on the exact same street in the desperately poor ghetto of Sidi Moumen.
I met journalist Aboubakr Jamai, to find out what'd drive young men to cause such destruction.
[Jamai] I think it's a mix of ingredients.
And, depending on the situation, one of the ingredients is more important than the others.
And, these ingredients, I think in the case of Morocco, the socio-economic ingredient is the most important one.
It's not a coincidence that all of the guys who blew themselves up in the 1 6th of May, uh, 2003, came from this shantytown.
They were either unemployed or had menial jobs.
And they were completely outcast in their own society.
[Morgan] What do you think is the solution?
[Jamai] The problem in Morocco, with the people here, is that we fail to give them an economic voice and a political voice.
To me, that's the solution.
Need to give opportunity, economically speaking, because extremism nourishes itself from darkness.
[ Ernest Ranglin and Baaba Maal:
Haayo]
[Morgan] That evening I was invited to dinner with Ahmed and his family, in the same 200 square-foot house he grew up in.
Ahmed doesn't want his children to fall prey to the same people the bombers did.
But with a poor education system and little money, he fears they could be exploited.
Thank you for letting us come here.
This is a great thing.
[in Arabic] Islam obligates us to be this way, to be brothers with everyone.
[Morgan] I'm about to have a baby in December.
Give me some fatherly advice.
You should take care of your wife.
I've got a good wife, so that's good.
If your relationship is based on love and good values, you will have good children.
[Morgan] Wow.
What kind of fish is that?
It's like a sardine.
It's delicious.
I'm glad.
Eat with good health.
So, I want you to tell me, what do you hope for your kids?
I want my kids to get an education.
The people who aren't educated won't accomplish anything in their life.
How did you do in school?
- [laughter]
- She's laughing!
She teases me.
Sometimes she and the kids gang up on me.
So do I have that to look forward to?
When you have your child they will do the same to you.
How hard is it to get a good education living in this area?
You can't get well educated living here, because of the poverty.
I'd like to hear your opinion.
When we hear about all these people who... what are your thoughts on those people?
Those people do not belong to Islam.
Even the terrorism that happened here was masterminded abroad.
The people who blew themselves up were tempted, some tempted by money and some by Paradise.
It is much harder for this generation than it was for my generation.
[woman in French] Violence is birthed by the economic dead ends that confront our youth who happen to be Muslim with an Islamic outlook.
How do you feel that we, as Americans, or how do we as a world culture start to end the fighting?
I believe that there is an enormous anger with American policy.
It's too bad it's the American people who have to pay for that anger.
And so we have the obligation not to fail our future, we have to reach out to each other, ignore official political lines and create unofficial bridges between civilian societies in order to bring about change.
What were your thoughts after 9/1 1 happened?
If it were truly Osama bin Laden, who did that, then he dealt us a bad hand.
He legitimized the American presence in the Middle East.
He was the reason for the adoption of all the anti-terrorist laws that have pushed us further under the yoke of our own local political leaders.
I was astonished on many levels.
It's horrible.
[beeping] [beeping]
[Morgan] Osama bin Laden says one reason for the creation of Al-Qaeda and attacks against the West, is the existence of Israel,
America's support of her and the treatment of the Palestinian people.
If Osama cares about the Palestinians so much,
I wanted to see if the feeling was mutual.
If it is,
I'm sure someone can help me narrow in on it.
[Morgan] How do you feel about Al-Qaeda causing acts of terrorism
- in the name of the Palestinian people?
- I don't agree with Al-Qaeda.
Yeah.
I'll leave that alone.
I don't agree with them at all.
It is none of their business to do anything for us.
We can do for ourselves.
We are fighting to make our homeland free.
It's none of their business.
[Morgan] I was wondering if you could help?
Looking for Osama bin Laden.
- [man] Go to Tora Bora.
No.
- Not here in Ramallah?
- No?
- They hate Osama bin Laden.
- Palestinians?
- Palestinians.
- And you know, if...
- Why do they hate him?
Because he likes blood.
You know?
He is a ridiculous Muslim.
He gives a bad picture about Islam.
[Arabic hip-hop plays]
We've heard Hamas is on the same level as Al-Qaeda.
Is that true?
[in Arabic] Ours is not a religious conflict.
We don't fight the Jews because they are Jews.
No, we fight them because they occupy our lands.
And Al-Qaeda, it holds all of the West as an enemy.
But the number one reason they say they do it is because of the Palestinian conflict.
Because of what's happening here.
Any Arab leader, all Arab movements have adopted the Palestinian issue because they know the Palestinian issue is what triggers the emotions and nationalistic feelings in all Arab and Muslim people.
But, at the same point, they're using you guys as, like, this battle cry, but they're doing nothing to help you.
That's the reality.
Without the Palestinian issue, they won't get any attention on the global level.
It is strategic on their part to adopt the Palestinian issue.
[Morgan] Unbelievable how many walls are here, the separation.
Everywhere you go there's a wall, a fence, barbed wire.
It's not for a human being.
It's good for a zoo.
[in Arabic] If this was happening in Israel,
America and all the other countries would protest it.
- The peace of life, we don't have it.
- Yeah.
And we are living in very big prison.
[in Arabic] I wish we had somebody like Osama bin Laden in Palestine.
Just to destroy the state of Israel.
It's a political struggle, a military struggle.
But the biggest thing is this.
All of this is about land.
Scattered through the hills of the Palestinian West Bank, are Israeli settlements, built to expand the Jewish presence in the region.
How does it feel, being overlooked by settlements?
It's not only overlooking us, but we are always under their foot.
[in Arabic] They can come and take over my home, where I live, by force.
What can I do?
I can't do anything.
[man] Tears and blood were shed today as Israel began the forced evacuation of Jewish settlers from their homes.
[Morgan] The settlements are a cause of violence between settlers and Palestinians, they are also a contentious issue within Israeli politics.
With one side seeing the settlements as another obstacle in achieving peace, while the other sees it as a divine right.
We Jews are the rightful owner of this land.
- Mm-hmm.
- It was a land that was promised to them by the Almighty, who kept his promise and brought us back.
After we realized there's going to be a struggle about every centimeter of the land, we realized we have to settle on the outposts to enlarge the area.
This outpost, for instance, it's...
- So is that legal to do that?
- It's illegal in the moment, as it is in the process of being legalized.
[Morgan] What is your thought on the Palestinian conflict?
When we were kids, there was this game where you play music
- and there's a circle of chairs.
- Yeah.
Musical chairs.
Musical chairs.
This is a bit like a musical chair tragedy.
Somebody is left without a chair.
But everybody needs to sit somewhere.
[Morgan] Should Israelis move out of the settlements?
israel'll have to let go of the territories.
We are not holding the territories, the territories are holding us.
The tragedy of this place is that everybody knows exactly what would be the solution in the end, the end of the story.
Two countries that are connected, but separated.
And this is the way it's going to end.
Every person in his right mind knows this is the way it's going to end.
One thing we don't know is how many people are going to die, and how much time is going to pass.
But the end is very clear.
- Yeah.
- That's tragic.
Are there politicians working towards a solution?
Yes, there are politicians who are working for peace.
The problem is, if you have three buses exploding in Tel Aviv,
- it will stop.
- Yeah.
And we can progress the peace process once again, and then if a settler in the territories will kill somebody, it will stop again.
And so, we're being held hostage by the extremists from both sides.
So this is basically Israel, and that's the Gaza Strip.
And...
It's pretty...
It's pretty scary.
It is really scary.
Imagine that rolling up over your hill, coming at your house.
Imagine living like this.
Imagine this is how you live every single day.
[explosion]
Oh, shit.
[woman] A Qassam touched down next to a daycare center in Sderot this morning.
No one was wounded in the attack, but the Hamas chief warned the rocket attacks on Israel will continue.
[Morgan] So this classroom was blown up about eight and a half hours ago.
Luckily, there were no kids in it.
Rocket came from the Gaza Strip.
If there had been kids in here, half of them would be dead.
You see this and get a sense of how wrong things are.
I can't imagine raising my kid up in a place like this.
I couldn't imagine living in a place where my kid went to school, and this is something that can happen every day.
[woman] I think everything's going pretty good with the pregnancy.
Thirty weeks, it's very active, and it's positioned the right way, and everything's good.
Take deep, full breaths into the belly.
I never imagined I would spend my pregnancy like this, separated from my partner, but, then again, before Morgan, I never thought I would have kids, so... [laughs]
You just never can tell, can you?
[siren wails]
Here with the Israeli Police Bomb Squad, they got a call.
Two calls, actually.
Going to check them out.
[siren wails]
- Is it right here?
- Yeah.
Right, few feet of us.
Let's go!
[in Hebrew] The suspicious object is here, past the garbage can.
[man in Hebrew] Listen up.
Good evening to everyone.
There is a suspicious object there.
I am asking everyone who is in this area of Allenby and the area of the boardwalk to move away from the area.
The man on the hotel balcony, get inside.
Everyone is requested to be behind the police gates.
Pay attention.
This is the bomb squad.
I am about to conduct a controlled explosion on the suspicious object.
[Morgan] It's so scary.
And this happens every day.
Eight to ten times a day, he said, sometimes up to 1 8.
Don't stand near the windows.
[man] Three... two... one.
Go.
There's a bikini inside.
[laughs] Check it out.
Well, my heart's pounding and it's a bikini. [laughs]
Nice job, pal.
You did good.
- [beeps]
- Good job, buddy.
No, come on.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
- [beeping]
- There'll be plenty more chances.
- [Morgan] Can we ask you questions?
- [man] About what?
- About....
- Political?
- A little bit. [laughs]
- No, no.
I'd love to hear your thoughts on the current conflict.
It's all an illusion?
Yes.
Wow.
That guy is one of the greatest optimists I've ever seen.
How you doing?
Can I ask you a couple of questions?
[splashing]
So somebody just threw a water balloon at us.
[man in Hebrew] Get the hell out of here!
And now there's a crowd gathering because they're going to chase us away.
They're gathering numbers now.
There's a big flock of people that's going to chase us.
- Go off!
- [man in Hebrew] Get out of here!
This is not your land.
I'm not allowed to talk to anybody in the country?
[man in Hebrew] Get the hell out of here!
- I'd say...
- Get out of here!
...we're not very wanted around here.
[in Hebrew] I'm going to break this.
This place is no joke.
We were down there just trying to talk to people.
So what you see here, majority of people here don't think like them.
Yeah, I think we've found enough peace here today.
Out of here, get out of here, get out of here!
It is...
It's no joke.
Go off!
Go off!
- I'm going to my car.
- Go off!
Dude.
- Yeah.
- Jewish?
I'm going to my car.
- No Jewish.
- [shouting]
There's so many things that are wrong on both sides.
If this was solved tomorrow, if, suddenly, there were two states, and people were living in peace, would bin Laden go away?
I don't think it would happen.
What you're doing, is you're taking an argument away.
It isn't.
It's messed up.
[shouting]
There goes my friend.
See you.
[Morgan] How hard is it for you to be in the minority in this region, a Christian in a Muslim country?
I have no problem whatsoever, living with the Muslims.
We are worshipping Allah.
And, uh, I am worshipping the same God, that the Christians and the Muslims and the Jews are worshipping.
The one God.
Religion is being used as a mask to hide the cruelty the ugliness of violence.
Moderates, they are the majority, but their voices are not loud enough.
[Morgan] What are your thoughts on the global war on terror?
9/1 1 breaks the hearts of every human being, but I think the best way is not to fight only.
You have to look for the root of the problem.
What our American brothers and friends need is a cultural strategy.
Without understanding each other, without this mutual respect, there's no peace.
It's impossible.
Mission is impossible.
[Morgan] Not only is it impossible, it's downright scary.
Just ask journalist Fouad Hussein.
Ten years ago while he was jailed for criticizing Jordan's economic policies, he met Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq.
They remained pen pals up until Zarqawi was killed in 2006.
According to what Zarqawi told him,
America is playing right into Al-Qaeda's hands.
[in Arabic] Al-Qaeda attacked New York and Washington on September 1 1th.
Because Al-Qaeda can't fight the U.S. on its soil, they drew them to Arabic land so that they will fight them here.
[Morgan] Had we left Afghanistan and said "That's it."
You know, "We're done." What would have happened?
After Afghanistan, Al-Qaeda didn't have anywhere to operate.
If the United States hadn't entered Iraq,
Al-Qaeda wouldn't be the same as they are now.
It would have ended by the end of Afghanistan.
The psychology of the Arabs and Muslims is to side with whoever fights the occupier.
If bin Laden would be caught or killed right now,
- would it make any difference?
- Nothing.
Nothing whatsoever.
Zarqawi was killed and nothing happened.
And if bin Laden and Zawahiri got killed, nothing will happen.
Because Al-Qaeda has become an intercontinental idea, the same as globalization.
[Morgan] And that idea is reaching more and more people each day.
With Operation Special Delivery only seven weeks away,
I need to go back to the beginning.
And the beginning for Osama is Saudi Arabia.
Saudi Arabia is a country ruled by one family, and governed by one brand of fundamental Islam, Wahhabism.
Osama was born here.
He went to school here.
And, in the late '70s, he was radicalized here.
[man in Arabic] O God, one leader to lead jihad for your sake.
To liberate the land of Palestine.
And the land of Iraq from the Christians.
O God, the strong and noble one.
O God, go after the Christians.
O God, make wars in their homes.
O God, release your armies upon them.
O God, make the land of Palestine a graveyard for the Jews.
O God, make the land of Iraq a graveyard for the Christians.
[Morgan] Do you feel America is trying to fight a war against the religion of Islam?
[in Arabic] Well, look at what you did in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Well, they went to Afghanistan to get Osama bin Laden.
And the Taliban wouldn't give him up.
Was it an act of aggression or not?
We were seeking peace in Afghanistan.
You went there with an ambulance or with a tank?
[laughter]
That's a good question.
Do you think Osama bin Laden caused 9/1 1?
If one man in a cave was able to do this...
What if all Muslims were to resist against America under the leadership of one man?
See, but I don't think 1.2 billion Muslims think the same way you think.
One single verse from the Koran and they will come.
So why has no one said that verse yet?
These things get planned.
Don't disregard it as unlikely.
What if we were to burn the refineries, just to deprive you of the oil?
[Morgan] You said Saudi Arabia is a country divided.
What do you mean by that?
Not divided, but not yet building the national unity we are looking for.
One important issue in the Kingdom, is to organize the relation between the religious establishment and the political establishment.
This issue hasn't been resolved yet, and it must be resolved.
Otherwise, extremists, terrorists, may dictate some of their ideologies on us.
And we still have so many people, who are refusing to accept the reality.
Are there still radicals within the country?
We still have a lot.
And they are dangerous, by the way.
We should not underestimate the ability of the extremists.
Those people are ready to die.
Those people are ready to destroy.
Those people are ready to kill themselves, kill their families, they don't care about life.
Therefore, I think they are a threat us, in Saudi Arabia, then to other countries, then to the world.
[man] In an unprecedented nine month operation netting more than 170 Al-Qaeda suspects, and more than five million dollars,
Saudi intelligence officials say they thwarted plans to fly aircraft into oil facilities, attack security installations, kill senior officials and send money to Al-Qaeda in Iraq.
But the raids reveal a far more worrying trend for the Saudis.
The war in Iraq is spilling over into Saudi Arabia.
Right in front of the head office of the Mutawwa'un, the religious police, is Chop Chop Square.
I'm standing right on the drain where they...
[makes slicing noises] ...cut people's heads off, and the blood goes into that drain.
Everybody stands around and watches.
They kill people in the morning and then play soccer in the afternoons.
What a place.
[Morgan] It's complete culture shock for me to be in Saudi Arabia.
An absolute other world, from anything I've ever experienced, any place I've ever been.
We've been to Egypt and Morocco and Jordan, and the Palestinian territories, and these places are so progressive by comparison.
There is no separation of church and state.
Church is the state, state is the church.
The religion and the ideology is what runs everything.
Boys and girls separated from the time they're ten.
You can't see La Perla's brassiere ad.
That's wrong.
Oh, you can't see Posh Spice's shoulder.
You can't see the knee or the thigh.
- Can't I police my own thoughts?
- No.
[Morgan] That's the problem when a country's built entirely on marriage between church and state.
There isn't much room for moderates.
There's no freedom of speech or freedom of the press, speaking or writing anything critical of the royal family is illegal.
Public protest is actually forbidden.
The Ministry of Information monitors the Web for any immoral content, but websites supporting Al-Qaeda seem to get through just fine.
[Morgan] What do fundamentalists hope to achieve?
Power in the name of God.
That's where I don't like it.
They manipulate the Islamic teachings to fit different situations, different conditions,
- to, ultimately, lead them to power.
- Yeah.
I don't think a religious person, be it Christian, Jewish or Muslim, by his own upbringing and teaching, is qualified to be a public official.
He's just not.
Politics is completely different from religion.
I don't think any religious person is qualified to be a public official.
A good amount of secularism in every Arab political system is badly needed.
Drawing clear lines between where an lmam, a priest role, a responsibility ends, and a politician, or a public official's responsibility begins.
We need it for stability.
I'd love to hear your thoughts on Osama bin Laden.
Osama bin Laden, per se, is not the problem.
The school of thought, the followers, the teaching that he has planted in Islamic countries, in the Muslim world, is where the restructuring and the fight should begin.
It's unfortunate, but he is a product of the system, the establishment.
There's no denying that.
We have to accept that.
[Morgan] I went to a school to find what kids are being taught about the west.
[ Jon Spurney:
School Days]
[Morgan] These two young, open-minded, free-thinking students, picked by the administration, are the two I'm allowed to speak to.
Understanding that their teacher and principal be present the whole time.
[Morgan] How old are you guys?
[man in Arabic] Eighteen.
Eighteen, yeah.
So how is it being 1 8 in Saudi Arabia?
[in Arabic] Great.
We have no worries or troubles.
What did you learn about the United States while you were in school?
Actually, we did not study the United States specifically.
What's your opinion of the United States?
I have no definite opinion...
no specific opinion.
I'm just curious what you think about the U.S.
In the United States we hear one idea about Muslim countries,
Saudi Arabia is where the hijackers came from.
Saudi Arabia is the country that makes a lot of money off of oil.
So I'm curious what you guys hear about the United States.
No answer.
You have no answer?
No?
How about you?
Their view is...
Americans always want to dominate...
No, that was the wrong answer...
One of the things we hear a lot in the United States, is that there's a lot of anti-Western, or anti-Semitic things taught in school.
What are you taught about Israel?
[man in Arabic] Stop your cameras.
- What's wrong?
I'm sorry?
- They want to stop.
- They want to stop the whole thing?
- Yes.
OK. [laughs]
How are you to have a discussion, if he can't talk about things?
How are things supposed to change if you can't address them?
Excuse me, I was wondering if we could ask you a question?
Excuse me, I was wondering if you guys could help me?
No?
Could I ask you guys a question?
No?
Do you know anybody who could get me in touch with Osama bin Laden?
Osama bin Laden?
[in Arabic] No, I have no leads.
It's becoming more obvious, Osama never went to the mall.
- So this is a good moisturizer?
- [woman] Yeah.
- lt'll keep my hands really soft?
- Yeah.
- Where can I find Osama bin Laden?
- What?
- You saw him?
- Yes.
Do you know which aisle he was in?
- [laughing]
- Was he down past the Nutella?
Is he in Saudi Arabia?
- Maybe.
- Maybe.
OK.
Maybe you can ask his family.
Maybe they can help you.
- OK.
All right.
- Yeah.
- Cool, I'll do that.
Thanks.
Bye.
- OK.
Bye.
It's a great suggestion.
I'm going to talk to his family.
[ Folkfoot:
Where in the World is Osama bin Laden (Freedom's Call)]
[ Folkfoot:
Where in the World is Osama bin Laden (Freedom's Call)]
OK, this is the Bin Laden Aviation Agency.
How fitting, right?
That's terrible.
Look, I'm not lying.
Right there.
There's the Bin Laden Aviation Agency.
[in Arabic] Where can I marry Osama bin Laden?
- Oh, you don't know?
- [woman] I don't.
[man] Please make sure that you have the correct number.
Your call cannot be completed as dialed.
After 9/1 1, wouldn't you change your number if your last name was bin Laden?
That probably would have been the very first thing I would have done.
I would have been like, "God, Osama, you asshole.
Now I got to change all my phone numbers."
[Morgan] There's a window right there.
[man in Arabic] We would like to ask you some questions about Osama bin Laden.
Yeah.
We're looking for anything.
A phone number, any information we could get.
Anything anybody may know.
He's like, "Do you think he's here?"
I said, "He's not here?" He goes, "Maybe." Maybe!
- He's in the basement.
- Maybe he's in the basement.
I'm looking for Osama bin Laden.
- [laughing]
- Why is that funny?
Why is that funny?
What's wrong with that?
- Where is your car?
- Where is my car?
Why, you going to blow it up or something?
You want to see it?
[Morgan] We're going up to bin Laden's farm.
We're going to go to his place, this house that he built with his own hands.
We're going to talk to people in the village, see if somebody can get me in.
[speaking Arabic]
- [Morgan] That guy said this was it.
- [man] Yeah.
- Not much of a farm.
Look at this.
- Yeah.
It's like a trailer park.
This must be the house.
Let's go.
Let's get out of here.
Man, I should have bought some sandals.
[Morgan] Well, I didn't find OBL, or any good clues in the desert of Saudi Arabia.
But that night I did find Othman Ya al Bari, who's related to one of the 9/1 1 hijackers.
Hopefully, he could point me in the right direction.
He's got professional wrestling on TV, he knows what's good, see?
One of your relatives was said to be one of the hijackers.
- [in Arabic] Yes.
- Yeah.
Was he?
No.
After 9/1 1, there was video of a lot of the hijackers.
A lot of them released video statements.
Do you not think that connects them in some way to what happened?
I don't believe that is solid proof.
America wins all the Oscar awards.
It owns the best studios and technologies in the world.
We've seen the animals, the lion, the dog and the pig, we've seen them in many movies talking like humans.
I feel very uncomfortable with this conversation.
What do you think would drive some people towards wanting to join a group like Al-Qaeda?
What would make them want to go off and fight, possibly lose their lives?
They go because they feel like America... you feel like...
She's trying all kinds of ways to dominate and impose her dominance on the entire world, especially on the Muslim world.
Have you had friends who have gone off to wage jihad?
Yes, of course.
Where did they go?
These youth went first to Afghanistan.
Then America went into Iraq, and they followed.
How many people do you know that went?
- A lot.
- [man] A lot.
And how many have come back?
Unfortunately, nobody came back.
[beeping]
[Morgan] Afghanistan is a country at war for more than 30 years, and it feels like it.
From when the Soviet Union invaded, to civil war, to the Taliban, and now the arrival of U. S. and NATO forces, its impact is everywhere.
Wherever you go there's barricades, barbed wire, people with guns, checkpoints, more people with guns.
And, in the middle of all this, is just this incredible poverty.
I thought the first place to look in Afghanistan for Osama was the last place that he was seen.
So we're heading out to Tora Bora.
They say, "No, no, it's not dangerous at all,"
yet there's 21 guys here with guns...
[laughs] taking us to Tora Bora.
"No, it's fine.
You're not gonna need to worry about it at all."
[Arabic music plays]
Are there a lot of landmines in this area?
[in foreign language] No, not on the path...
- Really?
- Really.
OK.
[Morgan] So, this area here, this was the beginning of Al-Qaeda's base?
[man in Arabic] This is where Osama's headquarters was.
There are large caves on this side and the other side too.
They were full of ammunition, weapons, and food such as tea, sugar and rice.
Look, up there, should we go?
One of our soldiers is shaking the nuts off the tree, 'cause, apparently, if you eat 20 of these nuts...
All night long.
It's the word on the street.
You can rock and roll all night.
Look at that, we got a guy up in the tree to get the magic nuts.
Dude, look at that.
While these guys are playing with their nuts, I think I'll head out on my own.
President Bush said that he wanted to capture Osama bin Laden dead or alive.
The U. S. had its best chance in late November of 2001, when elements of both Afghan and American forces closed in on Osama's mountain hideout.
The following days saw some of the heaviest fighting in all of the war.
Yoo-hoo!
Osama!
And, rather than commit additional U. S. ground forces, the U. S. chose to rely on local Afghan fighters to bring in OBL.
When the dust had settled, Osama was gone.
The governor of the province has ideas how to bring the excitement back.
[in foreign language] Our plan and goal is that Tora Bora should become an international tourism center.
So we want to build a grand amusement park in Tora Bora.
What kind of rides?
Everything will be built.
Maybe a roller coaster.
Everything will be built.
- Water slides?
- Absolutely.
- Ferris wheels?
All of it?
- Yes.
Yes.
You could say, "Tora Bora.
It's the bomb."
[crickets chirping]
[Morgan] I'm not sure how much fun Afghanistan is ready for.
Seems to me they could use a lot more than just roller coasters around here.
[in foreign language] No one has done anything for us.
All the international aid goes to those at the top.
It never makes its way down to us.
You got a tent from the UN.
No, we bought it in the black market!
- No, we buy it in the black market.
- [laughing]
They haven't helped us with land, money or to fix our tent or anything.
Look at this troublemaker!
When we're traveling at night, we have to constantly check the camel to make sure we didn't leave him somewhere.
Have you left him behind before?
Yeah, all the time!
We've lost them many times!
Our lives already passed.
We are concerned about our children.
They should be able to have a better life.
[man] The international community is failing to help this country get on its feet.
Organizations such as USA gauge success by how much money they spend.
Not by what it achieves.
The bigger budget they have, the more impressed they are.
The fact that it doesn't achieve anything, all the clinics don't exist, no one seems to care back in the States, that information doesn't get there.
[in foreign language] No one is helping this place, and if there is, no one is distributing it.
There are more than 800 houses here but no school or hospital.
We are living the same now as we were under the Taliban.
America must hold our government accountable.
America must ask why didn't you pave the streets with the money we gave you.
All those houses were destroyed by foreign countries.
Why don't they rebuild those houses?
They haven't done anything positive here.
Two years ago, the U.S. Ambassador came here and said,
"We're going to make a pledge to rebuild the school." It's been two years.
Look at this place.
This is hearts and minds.
It looks like a bomb went off yesterday.
There's bullet holes.
The front of the building is riddled with bullet holes.
Blast holes.
Nothing's being done.
We've got to do something for these kids.
We've gotta do something for these kids to say, "Somebody cares about us.
Somebody cares about us getting educated.
Somebody wants us to be in a safe environment."
[Morgan] As somebody about to become a father for the first time, it's so instilling in me, reminding me, of the things that I want for my family.
I don't ever want my child to be in a position where they can't be educated.
Or can't feel like they can better themselves, like that this is it.
That this is as good as it gets for their life, and to not have hope that tomorrow is going to be better.
- [phone ringing]
- Ow.
- [phone ringing]
- Ow.
Man, this baby starts kicking as soon as your phone rings.
- Baby knew I was calling.
- We miss you.
Baby knew.
Ow!
- Oh, I miss you so much.
- Yeah.
Me, too.
[Morgan] I dreamt we had a girl last night.
[woman] That's cute.
[Morgan] Ever see Osama bin Laden around here?
[in foreign language] God know, if we catch him, we will tear him apart.
Osama bin Laden's Afghan's enemies.
[in foreign language] Who is Osama?
He is the one who destroyed those buildings in America.
Fuck him.
And fuck America.
I'm looking for Osama bin Laden.
- Pakistan.
- Pakistan?
- Pakistan.
- OK!
Pakistan?
Pakistan.
[in foreign language] It is very obvious to the world that he is hiding in Pakistan.
You should find him so we have peace in the world.
[Morgan] I'm looking for Osama bin Laden.
[in foreign language] Tribal area.
Near Peshawar?
[heart beat on speaker]
That is so cool.
I love you so much.
I love you too, baby.
[imitating heartbeat]
That was my baby's little disco heartbeat.
What will happen if I go to Pakistan to look for him?
[in foreign language] You will find him.
I will find him?
You want to come look for him with me?
No?
[laughing]
Why not?
I'll miss my family.
- [man] I'm gonna miss my family.
- You'll miss your family.
I miss my family very much.
If I went into the tribal area, you think I'd be OK?
[in foreign language] God knows what will happen if you go there.
Something terrible will happen to you.
You're finished.
The Taliban will cut your head.
- They'll cut my head?
Yeah.
- Yeah.
Ugh!
So Alex started getting contractions last night.
Braxton Hicks contractions, which aren't real contractions, but it's your body preparing for a contraction.
And, here I am, missing it all.
And, here I am, missing it all.
Missing it all, man, missing it all.
[man singing in Arabic]
[Morgan] We just found out from U.S. military that we can go out on an embed.
And it's frightening.
But the most important thing, for me, is to try and, hopefully, just narrow down the path to finding the most wanted man on the planet.
How much they're actually looking for this guy, who knows?
But we'll find out.
This stuff is so heavy.
Everything in your body tells you you shouldn't be going to a job, or doing something where you gotta wear a bulletproof vest.
[man] The next thing you'll see here in America you'll see terrorism.
If you don't think you'll see, you're blinding yourself to the historic development of everything taking place on this earth.
Terrorism.
Terrorism.
[man] First of all, I'd like to welcome all of you guys to Firebase Apache.
- What questions do you have?
- Will we be able to speak to any of the people in the area who actually live in the local villages?
Um, when you go out to 4-2, yeah.
- There's a village right next to them.
- OK.
And that village also happens to be full of Taliban.
[woman] I'd like to remind you, while talking about going outside the wire.
When whoever we're with, whoever's escorting us says, "Let's go,"
get in the vehicle and go.
It doesn't mean finish your question.
It means go now.
[Leppert] This is hardcore Taliban country, let me tell you.
Over those mountains, that's Afghanistan.
If you go over those mountains, that's Pakistan.
We're centrally located with a lot of activity around us.
[Morgan] Will we stop in a village tomorrow?
- Yes, we will.
- What's the plan for the afternoon?
We're fogbound, we'll test fire weapons, talk, whatever you want.
You've got free rein.
I had a lot of grouping right beside the guy.
Well, if nothing else, it scared the hell out of him.
Can I try a rocket launcher?
[laughing] That was awesome.
You've been here six months.
You might be able to tell me.
Where is Osama bin Laden?
[Leppert] We ask that every time we go out.
"Hey?
You guys know where Osama's at?" They always point up to the mountains.
[in foreign language] Where's Osama?
[laughter]
- [Morgan] Where's Osama bin Laden?
- I have no clue.
Is he alive?
Even if he was, I don't think we'd know.
We are going to stop and speak to villagers.
They said I should write my blood type on anything that'd be attached to me.
Scary as shit, man.
What we're concentrating on is your security.
That's it.
In a firefight I'm going to come in.
Come to this effect, bring you in and we'll grab you to here.
As soon as I do, I'm going to try to grab you again.
As soon as it's safe, then we're going to move out.
When we go out, we expect to have contact.
We expect to get shot at.
Anything goes out there.
We always got to be ready for everything.
[man] This is what we call a "friendly village."
[laughter] [man] Once they understand it's their choice to talk, the forces will stand back.
And then whoever wants to talk to you will talk to you.
[man] Morgan, come up, let's introduce you.
Yes, sir.
[in foreign language] This person is a civilian from America and wants to ask you some questions.
His name is Morgan.
[Morgan] I was hoping you could tell me your thoughts on the Taliban and the current conflict happening.
[in foreign language] What do you think, who is happy with battles?
No one is happy with battles.
We are not happy.
We don't like the war.
We want a peaceful life.
We are neither your friends nor the Taliban's.
We just want a simple life.
What are things, when you look at your village, you need the most?
In terms of assistance.
The most important problem is the lack of water.
Before the base drilled their well we didn't have any water problems.
- What do you think of Osama bin Laden?
- [man] Morgan!
Let's go now!
Now!
- Come on!
- Let's go now!
[man on radio] Be advised, I've just been informed of an ambush, possibly the governor's convoy.
[man 2] And we are in pursuit of two individuals on foot.
Jedi-1, we're at 2-0-6.
That village to our left is where the Taliban went to.
We have one downed Taliban.
We have their motorcycle in our possession.
Over.
[Morgan] People have said Afghanistan is a winnable war.
What are your thoughts?
In counter-insurgency, killing doesn't work.
Got to work on the center of gravity, the people.
They like having clean water, having a medical clinic.
They like seeing their kids go to school.
It just makes it more difficult for the Taliban to change the tide and get the people to go to the other side.
[in foreign language] Thank you and please tell your commander the father of Taza Gui says peace.
[Morgan] What would have happened if we had sent more troops here in 2002?
You would have killed more Taliban, but, I mean, we're killing a lot of Taliban right now.
And they've got the open sieve from the madrassas of Pakistan in the refugee camps that go to these young kids who don't have a job, who have no positive outlook in life.
They sell them with a lot of propaganda.
Tell them they're going to give their family money, bring them here.
- Where is Osama?
- I think he's in Pakistan.
[beeping]
I think it's quite likely that Osama bin Laden is in Pakistan.
[woman] The latest intelligence has always seemed to indicate that he is in Pakistan.
[man] He's probably somewhere along that border region.
- Pakistan.
- Along that border.
Tribal areas of Pakistan.
Senior leadership, number one and two are there.
On the Pakistan border it's particularly dangerous, a region where terror rules.
And where many believe Osama bin Laden could be hiding.
Everyone I've spoken to said this is where Osama's hiding out.
[Morgan] Everyone, that is, except for Pakistanis.
- Where is Osama?
- [Morgan] You tell me.
- Where is Osama?
- I'm looking for him.
You tell me.
[in foreign language] He's in Afghanistan.
Osama bin Laden is here.
Afghanistan.
Osama bin Laden...
Which animal is that?
I don't where he is, but it's also a question if he's alive or dead.
But, um, his influence is here.
[in foreign language] He is a great soldier of the Muslims.
He is fighting for righteousness.
He's a diamond.
Osama is exploiting the root causes.
If we find the root causes, we'll solve everything.
- Osama bin Laden is nothing, sir.
- He is only one!
One person!
Dude, look at that.
Even in Pakistan they love wrestling.
- All the people like the wrestling.
- Tell me why you like wrestling.
- Because wrestling is fair.
- Can I let you in on a little secret?
- It's fixed.
- Fixed?
- Fixed.
It's not real.
- Maybe.
- You are right.
I know.
You are right.
- OK.
Good.
But when it is for a belt, then it is not fixed.
I'm looking, uh...
How are you?
How are you?
Hi.
I'm just looking...
[Morgan] Just based on what everybody has said, I got to think we're within a couple hundred miles of where he is.
Maybe even less.
Yeah, OK.
OK.
Thank you.
Tomorrow we're heading into this area of the tribal regions, just past Peshawar, where everyone has told me Osama bin Laden is.
I mean, I have no idea what to expect when I get there.
I've been traveling for months to try and find this person that everybody we talk to...
You know, they all say,
"Why are you looking for this person?
What is he?
He's one man?"
The thing that I've realized is that this whole trip is a chance to actually go out and see and talk to those people that we're told to be so scared of all the time.
I'm not somebody who thinks we can sit around the campfire and sing Kumbaya, you know?
That's ridiculous.
[laughing]
But I believe that we create these demons within ourselves.
And we create these demons within the media.
And we create these visions that are so beyond reality.
They start feeding themselves after a while.
Our fear just becomes exponential.
They say when you go looking for trouble, you'll find it.
It's not that I'm looking for trouble.
I'm just looking for answers.
And I think I've found a lot.
I think I've found a lot on this trip.
"Attention.
Entry of foreigners is prohibited beyond this point."
Even if I go over the border to find Osama, it's not going to, suddenly, make the world safer for my kid.
The things that are pushing people to follow him and his ideas are still going to be there.
And that's what we have to change.
I think that we need to take a step back and really ask ourselves, "What kind of a world do we want to live in?
What do we want that world to be?"
It's not worth it.
So her water just broke, which is very exciting.
So, I'm that much closer.
- OK.
- OK?
You want to get up?
[Alex groaning] [laughter] [woman] It's your son!
- [Morgan] It's a boy!
- [Alex] We have a baby boy!
- We have a baby boy.
- Oh, my God!
He's beautiful.
- [crying] - [laughter]
[Morgan] So, I didn't end up finding Osama.
What I did find, is that there are a lot more people out there who are just like us, than there are who are just like him.
I'll always bet on the billions of regular people to win over the crazies.
After all, we all want the same things for our families.
We want the world to be a place where we can raise and love our kids.
Where they can have everything they need to be happy, healthy, without it blowing up around them.
It's not going to be easy.
And all that reward money sure would have helped but, hey, you know what?
He's going to love public school.
[ Elvis Costello The Attractions:
(What's so Funny 'Bout) Peace Love and Understanding]
[man] You ever wake up in the morning and think,
"Man, life is good.
I mean, it just can't get any better than this. "
It's all beautiful and perfect and wonderful and amazing, and then, one day, that one thing happens that changes everything.
[bomb whistling]
- I'm pregnant.
- [man] That's only one test.
[man sighs] Oh, boy.
[Morgan] What kind of a world am I bringing a kid into?
They say the most important job a father has is to keep his baby safe.
But how am I going to do that?
I can cover the electrical sockets, or childproof Mommy's pill bottles, but that's just inside the house.
- What about out there?
- [sirens wailing]
There's cults, muggers, drugs, violence.
Not to mention all of the predators now lurking about.
I could move from the East Village to a family friendly neighborhood in Brooklyn, but is that enough to keep my child safe?
- And what about the big things?
- [thunder rumbles]
Things like hurricanes, earthquakes or tsunamis?
And that's just that mean, old, Mother Nature.
What about the really big things?
Things we should really be afraid of.
Like the most wanted man on the planet.
What about him?
We've got the strongest military, sneakiest spies and coolest technology in the entire world, but we can't find one man hiding in
Afghanibaluchapakiwaziristan?
[ MC Hammer:
U Can't Touch This]
[man] After 9/1 1, I thought some satellite would shoot a laser down onto the earth, fry up an omelet bin Laden and save us all.
But that wasn't the case.
I know, maybe he's dead.
But maybe he's alive.
Maybe he's on dialysis.
Maybe he's a nine foot bionic ninja with X-ray vision and the power of flight.
All I know is that in the last six years, there've been more acts of terrorism, worldwide, than in 20 years leading up to it.
Today, there are known terrorist cells in more than 100 countries around the world.
By the time my kid's out of diapers, everyone's gonna be a terrorist.
Nowhere's gonna be safe.
With Operation Special Delivery only 1 9 weeks away,
I just can't sit around and do nothing.
If the CIA and the FBI can't find him, and I'm going to make this world safe for my child, it's time for a new plan.
If I've learned anything from big budget action movies, it's that complicated global problems are best solved by one lonely guy crazy enough to think he can fix everything before the credits roll.
And I'm going to find out once and for all:
Where in the world is Osama bin Laden?
[ Jon Spurney:
Where in the World is Osama bin Laden?
]
[all hollering]
[hooting]
Moustache ride.
Reign of Terror!
I'm gonna get you, Osama been hiding.
[Morgan] I wanted to talk to you because I'm getting ready to do a lot of travel.
I wanted to see if I'm going to need any shots, anything...
Where are you going to be going?
We're going to go look for Osama bin Laden.
OK. [laughs] You'll probably find him.
Um, you're going to need a whole bunch of shots and prescriptions.
- You want to do it, want to go for it?
- I'm going to need it all, right?
- How many shots am I getting?
- Diphtheria, tetanus, polio.
Typhoid, meningitis, hepatitis A and B.
This one I must tell you about.
This is your yellow fever.
About one in one million people who get the yellow fever shot, get a very, very bad reaction.
They get multi-system organ failure.
There are six reported cases or more, maybe seven or eight.
And about four of them died.
[Morgan] Going to need more than shots to keep me safe in the places I'm heading to.
[man] This is reality-based personal protection, teaching you how to survive explosions, small arms attacks, sniper attacks, chemical attacks.
We cover it all.
We're going to simulate a hand grenade attack.
Boom!
You would have been killed.
I'll show you how to survive.
The first thing you want to do is turn away from the grenade and dive.
You're in a perfect position.
This is going to save your life by 98 percent.
When someone's head explodes, that's what it looks like.
Even though it's tragic, we can't focus on this, we got to think about survival.
Look at the wall there.
What do you see?
- [Morgan] I see blood.
- [Wagner] OK, good.
We have the "blood splatter."
How do we determine where the sniper is at, based on our situation here?
Hold up a hat on a stick.
If I'm in a restaurant, I don't want to sit in the middle.
If a gunman came, where is he most likely to hit?
You're dead here.
This is what we call the "fatal funnel."
You want to stay behind that line, you want to stay off the wall.
You're dead here.
You're dead here.
Any time you leave your vehicle, you gotta assume, in dangerous places, someone could plant a bomb on your vehicle.
You're dead here.
- [both laughing]
- You're dead here.
Here's what I recommend, you go around the corner, and then you can pull it open, and if it doesn't go boom, you can go check it out.
Gonna be the most paranoid person in the Middle East.
Maybe that's a good thing.
Because if I'm going to find Osama,
I'm traveling to scary places.
In the last year, the State Department issued over 100 warnings about traveling to the Middle East.
Mainly because Americans are now bigger targets for kidnapping and murder.
[Wagner] Now we're going to have a little classroom time about kidnapping.
Here are some basics of surviving as a hostage.
You got to accept it and start planning on how you're going to survive it.
Speak only if spoken to.
- Is this the crew's, the cameraman's?
- No.
[Wagner] Don't provoke the captors.
Don't stare at them.
Don't have a harsh tone of voice.
Don't be argumentative.
Don't have an attitude.
These people are in control, not you.
[man] This is not a fucking game.
[Wagner] Especially when you're in Baghdad, Kabul, or you're in Turkey, this stuff is going on daily, and you gotta be prepared for it.
I'm usually a pretty calm person when it comes to crazy shit happening around me.
But that's a whole other level of crazy.
[guitar riffs play]
We wage a war to save a civilization itself.
[guitar riffs play]
They hate us, our country.
They hate the liberties for which we stand.
[guitar riffs play]
Until you catch the chicken, you don't have the chicken.
- Go, go, go!
- [ Jon Spurney:
No Pain, No Gain]
Want you to get used to the sound of the language.
- [both making consonant sounds]
- Oh, good, Wow.
Go for the eyes.
The eyes!
Are you going to convert to Muslim or not?
Shoot him, shoot him.
I recommend you wear the clothes.
Maybe you can hit the tanning salon a little bit.
- [shots firing] - [yelling]
- Grenade!
- [screaming]
Somebody said I should grow my beard out?
Yeah, for you.
Because you obviously look very foreign.
- Look at this area.
Much bigger, right?
- This guy is probably alive.
[speaking foreign language]
You could have a situation where a device explodes and it gets on you.
Oh, fuck!
I brought you these outfits.
Hopefully, it keeps you safe.
This is a normal reaction.
He's fine.
How do I say, "Don't take me, take the cameraman?"
He's alive!
You have to know the way an Islamic terrorist thinks.
[Morgan] Jim's right.
I need to learn how Osama thinks.
To find a fox, you need to think like a fox.
I need to get inside his head and learn what makes him tick.
I need to explore the world he comes from.
Meet the people who influenced him.
Visit the places that shaped him into who he is today.
And, most of all, I need to try to understand what drives an Osama bin Laden to begin with.
I know just the place to start.
[beeping]
[ Malik Audouane:
Theme from Shaft]
Egypt is the birthplace of one of the heaviest hitters in the world of terrorism.
Ayman Al-Zawahiri.
He's Al-Qaeda's Team Manager and Osama's personal mentor.
His stats are pretty impressive.
He was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood at the age of 14.
He's a life-long follower of Sayyid Qutb, the man credited with creating modern day Islamic fundamentalism, is currently the number two of Al-Qaeda, and he's a Gemini.
And I got a tip where to find his uncle, Mahfouz Azzam.
If he can tell me where the A-man is, odds are Osama won't be too far away.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Mahfouz?
[speaks Arabic]
- It's nice to see you.
Welcome.
- Nice to see you.
- Thank you.
- Please.
- It's a beautiful day today.
Very nice.
- Yeah.
- [Morgan] So do you know where he is?
- [man in Arabic] No.
Where do you think he is?
[in Arabic] If you learn where he is, I beg you, let me know.
I just want to make sure he is OK.
He won't let me know by phone because you kill people with the phone.
The Russians killed the president of Chechnya with the phone, and you Americans have killed people with the phone.
This, a telephone, has become a lethal weapon!
And every month my bank account gets killed by my phone.
- [laughing]
- Which makes it even worse.
So, if you knew where he was, you wouldn't turn him in for the $25,000,000?
[laughs]
I would like to tell you something, the hungry who cannot find bread to eat in Afghanistan they wouldn't accept these $25 million of yours to turn in a Muslim they know is waging jihad for them.
So he's in Afghanistan?
- You say so.
- You said so.
You just told me.
America says so.
America says so.
- Do you think he's in Afghanistan?
- America says.
So if Al-Zawahiri and Osama bin Laden just disappeared tomorrow, would things change?
The seed that was sown by America, a seed of spitefulness, hate, aggression and killing, cannot disappear in the short term.
There has to be another foreign policy to uproot this seed.
[Morgan] It's easy to criticize American foreign policy, with the second most wanted terrorist in the family.
I should find regular folks who might be more objective.
What do you guys hear about Americans?
[in Arabic] The Americans are known to be fighting the Egyptians, Palestinians and Iraqis.
- We're fighting you?
- [laughing]
- Yes.
- Really?
I didn't even know that.
What are we fighting the Egyptians for?
[speaking Arabic]
You want to occupy Egypt.
[Morgan] Do we?
Why?
We're not that well versed in politics but that's what we hear on TV and stuff.
What do you think about America?
[in Arabic] They are good people, but we reject the American foreign policy.
[Morgan] How can he be against American foreign policy?
Egypt is one of our best friends in the region and in the global war on terror.
At the same time, it was home to five of the founding fathers of Al-Qaeda.
The guy who tried to blow up the World Trade Center in '93, and the ringleader of the 9/1 1 hijackings.
Maybe university students could tell me why Osama's making so many friends here.
It's about oppression, because Egypt is a developing country, so, like, the people who are oppressed are kind of more...
So it develops more terrorists, and that's it.
[in Arabic] These would be the minority, the rotten type.
Every society has the same.
Every society has good and bad.
In Egypt, people have no freedom.
And they try and prove to the government that they have freedom, deserve freedom, by committing terrorist attacks.
Did you vote in the last presidential election?
- No.
- No.
- You weren't old enough yet?
- It's not that.
I don't believe in it.
I know it's rigged.
I know that Hosni Mubarak would have won anyway.
They call this a democratic country, but it's not.
In Egypt, if a president wants to stay in power, he'll stay in power.
[applause]
[Morgan] And Hosni Mubarak has been in power for more than 26 years.
The United States has got a close and meaningful relationship with Egypt.
[cheering]
This relationship is a cornerstone for our policy in the Middle East.
[Morgan] Policy that includes giving Mubarak an aid package, while looking the other way as he uses riot police and hired thugs armed with sticks, knives, swords and Molotov cocktails to keep the opposition from voting on election day.
You might say about Mubarak the same thing FDR said about another dictator.
He may be a son of a bitch, but he's our son of a bitch.
[Morgan] See, we've had a policy of propping up dictators for more than 50 years now.
When the Cold War started heating up, we decided to do what it took to stop communism from taking over.
And the United States started mixing with a rougher crowd.
Hmm!
In 1 953, the CIA helped the Shah of Iran overthrow the Iranian government, to become their supreme ruler.
Sure, the Shah tortured or killed anyone who publicly disagreed with him.
Even went as far as shoving broken glass up the nether regions of critics.
But he totally hated Communism.
Now, he was a son of a bitch, but he was our son of a bitch.
The Shah kept Iran in our corner until 1 979, when Ayatollah Khomeini's Islamic revolution swept to power, and held 52 Americans hostage for 15 months.
That's when we made friends with Saddam Hussein over in Iraq.
Now, he was an SOB too, but for ten years, while he was fighting the Iranians, he was our SOB.
In fact, by the mid-'80s, we had sons of bitches all the way from Latin America to the Middle East, but, hey, pimping freedom ain't easy.
[hip-hop music plays]
[Morgan] We needed to keep our SOBs happy and on our side.
So we provided them with tanks, guns, planes and more money.
Today we give Egypt more than 2 billion dollars a year in weapons and aid.
Sure, there's torture, murder and rampant political corruption, but somewhere along the way we decided that, in order to protect our own freedom, it was all right to sacrifice the freedom of others.
Does lack of democracy, human rights, in countries like Egypt encourage people to get involved in extremist radical groups?
Of course.
There's no doubt about this.
It's the one thing that I agree with George W. Bush about.
That people join terrorist organizations because there is no other way to be active.
The threat of terrorism created the climate of fear that is being exploited by the Mubarak regime and by George Bush.
We're going through a very difficult time now.
I mean, we have terrorists on one side, and opportunist, exploitative regimes on the other side.
The U.S. can no longer claim the moral ground.
People have learned to expect a lot less from the U.S. than they used to.
[Arabic music plays]
[man in Arabic] The United States is the main problem in the region, frankly.
We love the American people, but we hate the American government.
[in Arabic] We pray to God to destroy you because of what's happening.
[Morgan] America's filled with people who want people to live peacefully, to co-exist together, just like me.
OK, I don't want you to be there when it happens.
Have a smell.
[Morgan] You know, being in the States, all we get on the news are the crazy nuts that like to scream, "Death to you!"
And so you're like, "Oh, man.
Go get them."
But we've been in Egypt for a week now, talking to people, who are real people, just like you and me.
One after another after another everybody said,
"This government's corrupt and it's backed by the U. S. "
- [chanting]
- It's hard for me to see how damaged the image of the country that I love and care about has become.
[phone rings]
- [Morgan] Hello?
- I got your postcard from Egypt today.
Oh, nice.
You sound good.
I am good.
Just promise you'll be here when it's really important.
OK?
I promise.
[woman] He has to be back by the first week of November, because I'm due the end of November, early December.
And, if he misses that, I'm going to be so upset.
And he's going to be upset.
But, also, he's going to these places that are so dangerous.
And I don't want him to miss anything.
And I don't want him to get hurt.
[man singing in Arabic] [man in Arabic] While we are living in these troubled times, we need to be merciful.
So get mercy through praises and prayers upon Him because He is mercy.
And He puts compassion in your heart.
As a Muslim I am taught that God has honored humankind.
He did not say he honored Muslims and everyone else is a second class citizen.
[speaking Arabic] We have honored the children of heaven.
[singing in Arabic]
[man] Your average Egyptian's struggling like your average American to make ends meet, to get a decent job, provide for his family, educate his kids.
The same concerns all over.
[Morgan] Torek is an Egyptian-American studying law at Al Azhar University.
He's a new dad and wants the world's view of Islam to change for the sake of his young son.
[Torek] We need to rectify this,
Muslims are over one fifth of the world population.
That's a lot of people.
It's not some Polynesian island somewhere.
- [Morgan laughs]
- That's a lot of people!
If four-fifths of the world are scared of one-fifth, what kind of civilization and humanity are we gonna have?
- [laughing] - [speaking Arabic]
Now they're going to think all we do is pray.
- Even the kids!
- I'm working on the voice-over.
From a very young age, they start manipulating the children.
[laughing]
[Torek] We need to differentiate between extreme factions in a population, and the regular, vast majority of people.
What do you think of the War on Terror?
It's a bogus term.
I don't think it means anything.
I think some guy that had too much to drink in the Pentagon, one night, came up with that.
- Dude, I got a great idea.
- A war on terrorism.
We had a war on drugs.
We didn't win that, either.
[Torek] But is it really a war on terror?
Have we eradicated terror?
Or are we exporting terror?
I think that...
Unfortunately, I think that we're exporting it.
I think that we lit the flame on a bomb.
[Morgan] The bomb Torek is speaking of is the explosive rise in terrorist attacks during the last seven years.
Al-Qaeda has now become a global franchise, serving up an unhealthy dose of j ihad to more and more people each year.
Ooh!
Can I help you?
[Morgan] Despite the U. S. spending over $500 billion fighting the war on terror,
Al-Qaeda continues to find new markets to expand into.
Thanks to heavy worldwide recruitment, which included having interested people filling out job applications, AQ is now back to its pre-9/1 1 strength.
Two of the U. S. 's closest allies, Spain and England, were both attacked by homegrown Al-Qaeda cells.
Even Muslim countries are finding they are in Al-Qaeda's crosshairs, often becoming the victims of terrorism and feeling the influence of Osama bin Laden firsthand.
[Arabic music plays]
[Morgan] Where is Osama bin Laden?
[in Arabic] He might be somewhere here in Morocco.
[in Arabic] How should I know?
- Bin Laden?
I am not a politic man.
- Yeah.
I don't know nothing about...
I'm a carpet dealer.
I sell carpet.
[Morgan] How many years has this tannery been here?
[in Arabic] Centuries.
What do you think about people who cause violence in the name of Islam?
[in Arabic] It is not from Islam to kill innocent people or to blow yourself up.
I'm disgusted by that.
[Morgan] Do you ever worry that your sons may get involved with terrorists?
We worry about that.
We don't want them to get involved with that kind of crowd.
That's why we have to take care of them financially.
[man in Arabic] Americans are causing all the trouble in the world.
But...
Were the...
But this is my opinion of the American government, not the American people.
[in Arabic] These are all the problems that Bush created.
I heard that they want to eradicate Islam.
[Morgan] What do you think about Osama bin Laden?
[speaking Arabic]
[Morgan laughs] He's crazy?
[in Arabic] Osama bin Laden, look how many people he's killed, how many have died.
And what has he accomplished?
He's accomplished a wave of suicide bombings in Morocco killing more than 50 people over the last four years.
The first attack was in May of 2003, when recruiters outside the country came to town and convinced 14 young men to blow themselves up in exchange for money and the rewards of paradise.
They all grew up on the exact same street in the desperately poor ghetto of Sidi Moumen.
I met journalist Aboubakr Jamai, to find out what'd drive young men to cause such destruction.
[Jamai] I think it's a mix of ingredients.
And, depending on the situation, one of the ingredients is more important than the others.
And, these ingredients, I think in the case of Morocco, the socio-economic ingredient is the most important one.
It's not a coincidence that all of the guys who blew themselves up in the 1 6th of May, uh, 2003, came from this shantytown.
They were either unemployed or had menial jobs.
And they were completely outcast in their own society.
[Morgan] What do you think is the solution?
[Jamai] The problem in Morocco, with the people here, is that we fail to give them an economic voice and a political voice.
To me, that's the solution.
Need to give opportunity, economically speaking, because extremism nourishes itself from darkness.
[ Ernest Ranglin and Baaba Maal:
Haayo]
[Morgan] That evening I was invited to dinner with Ahmed and his family, in the same 200 square-foot house he grew up in.
Ahmed doesn't want his children to fall prey to the same people the bombers did.
But with a poor education system and little money, he fears they could be exploited.
Thank you for letting us come here.
This is a great thing.
[in Arabic] Islam obligates us to be this way, to be brothers with everyone.
[Morgan] I'm about to have a baby in December.
Give me some fatherly advice.
You should take care of your wife.
I've got a good wife, so that's good.
If your relationship is based on love and good values, you will have good children.
[Morgan] Wow.
What kind of fish is that?
It's like a sardine.
It's delicious.
I'm glad.
Eat with good health.
So, I want you to tell me, what do you hope for your kids?
I want my kids to get an education.
The people who aren't educated won't accomplish anything in their life.
How did you do in school?
- [laughter]
- She's laughing!
She teases me.
Sometimes she and the kids gang up on me.
So do I have that to look forward to?
When you have your child they will do the same to you.
How hard is it to get a good education living in this area?
You can't get well educated living here, because of the poverty.
I'd like to hear your opinion.
When we hear about all these people who... what are your thoughts on those people?
Those people do not belong to Islam.
Even the terrorism that happened here was masterminded abroad.
The people who blew themselves up were tempted, some tempted by money and some by Paradise.
It is much harder for this generation than it was for my generation.
[woman in French] Violence is birthed by the economic dead ends that confront our youth who happen to be Muslim with an Islamic outlook.
How do you feel that we, as Americans, or how do we as a world culture start to end the fighting?
I believe that there is an enormous anger with American policy.
It's too bad it's the American people who have to pay for that anger.
And so we have the obligation not to fail our future, we have to reach out to each other, ignore official political lines and create unofficial bridges between civilian societies in order to bring about change.
What were your thoughts after 9/1 1 happened?
If it were truly Osama bin Laden, who did that, then he dealt us a bad hand.
He legitimized the American presence in the Middle East.
He was the reason for the adoption of all the anti-terrorist laws that have pushed us further under the yoke of our own local political leaders.
I was astonished on many levels.
It's horrible.
[beeping] [beeping]
[Morgan] Osama bin Laden says one reason for the creation of Al-Qaeda and attacks against the West, is the existence of Israel,
America's support of her and the treatment of the Palestinian people.
If Osama cares about the Palestinians so much,
I wanted to see if the feeling was mutual.
If it is,
I'm sure someone can help me narrow in on it.
[Morgan] How do you feel about Al-Qaeda causing acts of terrorism
- in the name of the Palestinian people?
- I don't agree with Al-Qaeda.
Yeah.
I'll leave that alone.
I don't agree with them at all.
It is none of their business to do anything for us.
We can do for ourselves.
We are fighting to make our homeland free.
It's none of their business.
[Morgan] I was wondering if you could help?
Looking for Osama bin Laden.
- [man] Go to Tora Bora.
No.
- Not here in Ramallah?
- No?
- They hate Osama bin Laden.
- Palestinians?
- Palestinians.
- And you know, if...
- Why do they hate him?
Because he likes blood.
You know?
He is a ridiculous Muslim.
He gives a bad picture about Islam.
[Arabic hip-hop plays]
We've heard Hamas is on the same level as Al-Qaeda.
Is that true?
[in Arabic] Ours is not a religious conflict.
We don't fight the Jews because they are Jews.
No, we fight them because they occupy our lands.
And Al-Qaeda, it holds all of the West as an enemy.
But the number one reason they say they do it is because of the Palestinian conflict.
Because of what's happening here.
Any Arab leader, all Arab movements have adopted the Palestinian issue because they know the Palestinian issue is what triggers the emotions and nationalistic feelings in all Arab and Muslim people.
But, at the same point, they're using you guys as, like, this battle cry, but they're doing nothing to help you.
That's the reality.
Without the Palestinian issue, they won't get any attention on the global level.
It is strategic on their part to adopt the Palestinian issue.
[Morgan] Unbelievable how many walls are here, the separation.
Everywhere you go there's a wall, a fence, barbed wire.
It's not for a human being.
It's good for a zoo.
[in Arabic] If this was happening in Israel,
America and all the other countries would protest it.
- The peace of life, we don't have it.
- Yeah.
And we are living in very big prison.
[in Arabic] I wish we had somebody like Osama bin Laden in Palestine.
Just to destroy the state of Israel.
It's a political struggle, a military struggle.
But the biggest thing is this.
All of this is about land.
Scattered through the hills of the Palestinian West Bank, are Israeli settlements, built to expand the Jewish presence in the region.
How does it feel, being overlooked by settlements?
It's not only overlooking us, but we are always under their foot.
[in Arabic] They can come and take over my home, where I live, by force.
What can I do?
I can't do anything.
[man] Tears and blood were shed today as Israel began the forced evacuation of Jewish settlers from their homes.
[Morgan] The settlements are a cause of violence between settlers and Palestinians, they are also a contentious issue within Israeli politics.
With one side seeing the settlements as another obstacle in achieving peace, while the other sees it as a divine right.
We Jews are the rightful owner of this land.
- Mm-hmm.
- It was a land that was promised to them by the Almighty, who kept his promise and brought us back.
After we realized there's going to be a struggle about every centimeter of the land, we realized we have to settle on the outposts to enlarge the area.
This outpost, for instance, it's...
- So is that legal to do that?
- It's illegal in the moment, as it is in the process of being legalized.
[Morgan] What is your thought on the Palestinian conflict?
When we were kids, there was this game where you play music
- and there's a circle of chairs.
- Yeah.
Musical chairs.
Musical chairs.
This is a bit like a musical chair tragedy.
Somebody is left without a chair.
But everybody needs to sit somewhere.
[Morgan] Should Israelis move out of the settlements?
israel'll have to let go of the territories.
We are not holding the territories, the territories are holding us.
The tragedy of this place is that everybody knows exactly what would be the solution in the end, the end of the story.
Two countries that are connected, but separated.
And this is the way it's going to end.
Every person in his right mind knows this is the way it's going to end.
One thing we don't know is how many people are going to die, and how much time is going to pass.
But the end is very clear.
- Yeah.
- That's tragic.
Are there politicians working towards a solution?
Yes, there are politicians who are working for peace.
The problem is, if you have three buses exploding in Tel Aviv,
- it will stop.
- Yeah.
And we can progress the peace process once again, and then if a settler in the territories will kill somebody, it will stop again.
And so, we're being held hostage by the extremists from both sides.
So this is basically Israel, and that's the Gaza Strip.
And...
It's pretty...
It's pretty scary.
It is really scary.
Imagine that rolling up over your hill, coming at your house.
Imagine living like this.
Imagine this is how you live every single day.
[explosion]
Oh, shit.
[woman] A Qassam touched down next to a daycare center in Sderot this morning.
No one was wounded in the attack, but the Hamas chief warned the rocket attacks on Israel will continue.
[Morgan] So this classroom was blown up about eight and a half hours ago.
Luckily, there were no kids in it.
Rocket came from the Gaza Strip.
If there had been kids in here, half of them would be dead.
You see this and get a sense of how wrong things are.
I can't imagine raising my kid up in a place like this.
I couldn't imagine living in a place where my kid went to school, and this is something that can happen every day.
[woman] I think everything's going pretty good with the pregnancy.
Thirty weeks, it's very active, and it's positioned the right way, and everything's good.
Take deep, full breaths into the belly.
I never imagined I would spend my pregnancy like this, separated from my partner, but, then again, before Morgan, I never thought I would have kids, so... [laughs]
You just never can tell, can you?
[siren wails]
Here with the Israeli Police Bomb Squad, they got a call.
Two calls, actually.
Going to check them out.
[siren wails]
- Is it right here?
- Yeah.
Right, few feet of us.
Let's go!
[in Hebrew] The suspicious object is here, past the garbage can.
[man in Hebrew] Listen up.
Good evening to everyone.
There is a suspicious object there.
I am asking everyone who is in this area of Allenby and the area of the boardwalk to move away from the area.
The man on the hotel balcony, get inside.
Everyone is requested to be behind the police gates.
Pay attention.
This is the bomb squad.
I am about to conduct a controlled explosion on the suspicious object.
[Morgan] It's so scary.
And this happens every day.
Eight to ten times a day, he said, sometimes up to 1 8.
Don't stand near the windows.
[man] Three... two... one.
Go.
There's a bikini inside.
[laughs] Check it out.
Well, my heart's pounding and it's a bikini. [laughs]
Nice job, pal.
You did good.
- [beeps]
- Good job, buddy.
No, come on.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
- [beeping]
- There'll be plenty more chances.
- [Morgan] Can we ask you questions?
- [man] About what?
- About....
- Political?
- A little bit. [laughs]
- No, no.
I'd love to hear your thoughts on the current conflict.
It's all an illusion?
Yes.
Wow.
That guy is one of the greatest optimists I've ever seen.
How you doing?
Can I ask you a couple of questions?
[splashing]
So somebody just threw a water balloon at us.
[man in Hebrew] Get the hell out of here!
And now there's a crowd gathering because they're going to chase us away.
They're gathering numbers now.
There's a big flock of people that's going to chase us.
- Go off!
- [man in Hebrew] Get out of here!
This is not your land.
I'm not allowed to talk to anybody in the country?
[man in Hebrew] Get the hell out of here!
- I'd say...
- Get out of here!
...we're not very wanted around here.
[in Hebrew] I'm going to break this.
This place is no joke.
We were down there just trying to talk to people.
So what you see here, majority of people here don't think like them.
Yeah, I think we've found enough peace here today.
Out of here, get out of here, get out of here!
It is...
It's no joke.
Go off!
Go off!
- I'm going to my car.
- Go off!
Dude.
- Yeah.
- Jewish?
I'm going to my car.
- No Jewish.
- [shouting]
There's so many things that are wrong on both sides.
If this was solved tomorrow, if, suddenly, there were two states, and people were living in peace, would bin Laden go away?
I don't think it would happen.
What you're doing, is you're taking an argument away.
It isn't.
It's messed up.
[shouting]
There goes my friend.
See you.
[Morgan] How hard is it for you to be in the minority in this region, a Christian in a Muslim country?
I have no problem whatsoever, living with the Muslims.
We are worshipping Allah.
And, uh, I am worshipping the same God, that the Christians and the Muslims and the Jews are worshipping.
The one God.
Religion is being used as a mask to hide the cruelty the ugliness of violence.
Moderates, they are the majority, but their voices are not loud enough.
[Morgan] What are your thoughts on the global war on terror?
9/1 1 breaks the hearts of every human being, but I think the best way is not to fight only.
You have to look for the root of the problem.
What our American brothers and friends need is a cultural strategy.
Without understanding each other, without this mutual respect, there's no peace.
It's impossible.
Mission is impossible.
[Morgan] Not only is it impossible, it's downright scary.
Just ask journalist Fouad Hussein.
Ten years ago while he was jailed for criticizing Jordan's economic policies, he met Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq.
They remained pen pals up until Zarqawi was killed in 2006.
According to what Zarqawi told him,
America is playing right into Al-Qaeda's hands.
[in Arabic] Al-Qaeda attacked New York and Washington on September 1 1th.
Because Al-Qaeda can't fight the U.S. on its soil, they drew them to Arabic land so that they will fight them here.
[Morgan] Had we left Afghanistan and said "That's it."
You know, "We're done." What would have happened?
After Afghanistan, Al-Qaeda didn't have anywhere to operate.
If the United States hadn't entered Iraq,
Al-Qaeda wouldn't be the same as they are now.
It would have ended by the end of Afghanistan.
The psychology of the Arabs and Muslims is to side with whoever fights the occupier.
If bin Laden would be caught or killed right now,
- would it make any difference?
- Nothing.
Nothing whatsoever.
Zarqawi was killed and nothing happened.
And if bin Laden and Zawahiri got killed, nothing will happen.
Because Al-Qaeda has become an intercontinental idea, the same as globalization.
[Morgan] And that idea is reaching more and more people each day.
With Operation Special Delivery only seven weeks away,
I need to go back to the beginning.
And the beginning for Osama is Saudi Arabia.
Saudi Arabia is a country ruled by one family, and governed by one brand of fundamental Islam, Wahhabism.
Osama was born here.
He went to school here.
And, in the late '70s, he was radicalized here.
[man in Arabic] O God, one leader to lead jihad for your sake.
To liberate the land of Palestine.
And the land of Iraq from the Christians.
O God, the strong and noble one.
O God, go after the Christians.
O God, make wars in their homes.
O God, release your armies upon them.
O God, make the land of Palestine a graveyard for the Jews.
O God, make the land of Iraq a graveyard for the Christians.
[Morgan] Do you feel America is trying to fight a war against the religion of Islam?
[in Arabic] Well, look at what you did in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Well, they went to Afghanistan to get Osama bin Laden.
And the Taliban wouldn't give him up.
Was it an act of aggression or not?
We were seeking peace in Afghanistan.
You went there with an ambulance or with a tank?
[laughter]
That's a good question.
Do you think Osama bin Laden caused 9/1 1?
If one man in a cave was able to do this...
What if all Muslims were to resist against America under the leadership of one man?
See, but I don't think 1.2 billion Muslims think the same way you think.
One single verse from the Koran and they will come.
So why has no one said that verse yet?
These things get planned.
Don't disregard it as unlikely.
What if we were to burn the refineries, just to deprive you of the oil?
[Morgan] You said Saudi Arabia is a country divided.
What do you mean by that?
Not divided, but not yet building the national unity we are looking for.
One important issue in the Kingdom, is to organize the relation between the religious establishment and the political establishment.
This issue hasn't been resolved yet, and it must be resolved.
Otherwise, extremists, terrorists, may dictate some of their ideologies on us.
And we still have so many people, who are refusing to accept the reality.
Are there still radicals within the country?
We still have a lot.
And they are dangerous, by the way.
We should not underestimate the ability of the extremists.
Those people are ready to die.
Those people are ready to destroy.
Those people are ready to kill themselves, kill their families, they don't care about life.
Therefore, I think they are a threat us, in Saudi Arabia, then to other countries, then to the world.
[man] In an unprecedented nine month operation netting more than 170 Al-Qaeda suspects, and more than five million dollars,
Saudi intelligence officials say they thwarted plans to fly aircraft into oil facilities, attack security installations, kill senior officials and send money to Al-Qaeda in Iraq.
But the raids reveal a far more worrying trend for the Saudis.
The war in Iraq is spilling over into Saudi Arabia.
Right in front of the head office of the Mutawwa'un, the religious police, is Chop Chop Square.
I'm standing right on the drain where they...
[makes slicing noises] ...cut people's heads off, and the blood goes into that drain.
Everybody stands around and watches.
They kill people in the morning and then play soccer in the afternoons.
What a place.
[Morgan] It's complete culture shock for me to be in Saudi Arabia.
An absolute other world, from anything I've ever experienced, any place I've ever been.
We've been to Egypt and Morocco and Jordan, and the Palestinian territories, and these places are so progressive by comparison.
There is no separation of church and state.
Church is the state, state is the church.
The religion and the ideology is what runs everything.
Boys and girls separated from the time they're ten.
You can't see La Perla's brassiere ad.
That's wrong.
Oh, you can't see Posh Spice's shoulder.
You can't see the knee or the thigh.
- Can't I police my own thoughts?
- No.
[Morgan] That's the problem when a country's built entirely on marriage between church and state.
There isn't much room for moderates.
There's no freedom of speech or freedom of the press, speaking or writing anything critical of the royal family is illegal.
Public protest is actually forbidden.
The Ministry of Information monitors the Web for any immoral content, but websites supporting Al-Qaeda seem to get through just fine.
[Morgan] What do fundamentalists hope to achieve?
Power in the name of God.
That's where I don't like it.
They manipulate the Islamic teachings to fit different situations, different conditions,
- to, ultimately, lead them to power.
- Yeah.
I don't think a religious person, be it Christian, Jewish or Muslim, by his own upbringing and teaching, is qualified to be a public official.
He's just not.
Politics is completely different from religion.
I don't think any religious person is qualified to be a public official.
A good amount of secularism in every Arab political system is badly needed.
Drawing clear lines between where an lmam, a priest role, a responsibility ends, and a politician, or a public official's responsibility begins.
We need it for stability.
I'd love to hear your thoughts on Osama bin Laden.
Osama bin Laden, per se, is not the problem.
The school of thought, the followers, the teaching that he has planted in Islamic countries, in the Muslim world, is where the restructuring and the fight should begin.
It's unfortunate, but he is a product of the system, the establishment.
There's no denying that.
We have to accept that.
[Morgan] I went to a school to find what kids are being taught about the west.
[ Jon Spurney:
School Days]
[Morgan] These two young, open-minded, free-thinking students, picked by the administration, are the two I'm allowed to speak to.
Understanding that their teacher and principal be present the whole time.
[Morgan] How old are you guys?
[man in Arabic] Eighteen.
Eighteen, yeah.
So how is it being 1 8 in Saudi Arabia?
[in Arabic] Great.
We have no worries or troubles.
What did you learn about the United States while you were in school?
Actually, we did not study the United States specifically.
What's your opinion of the United States?
I have no definite opinion...
no specific opinion.
I'm just curious what you think about the U.S.
In the United States we hear one idea about Muslim countries,
Saudi Arabia is where the hijackers came from.
Saudi Arabia is the country that makes a lot of money off of oil.
So I'm curious what you guys hear about the United States.
No answer.
You have no answer?
No?
How about you?
Their view is...
Americans always want to dominate...
No, that was the wrong answer...
One of the things we hear a lot in the United States, is that there's a lot of anti-Western, or anti-Semitic things taught in school.
What are you taught about Israel?
[man in Arabic] Stop your cameras.
- What's wrong?
I'm sorry?
- They want to stop.
- They want to stop the whole thing?
- Yes.
OK. [laughs]
How are you to have a discussion, if he can't talk about things?
How are things supposed to change if you can't address them?
Excuse me, I was wondering if we could ask you a question?
Excuse me, I was wondering if you guys could help me?
No?
Could I ask you guys a question?
No?
Do you know anybody who could get me in touch with Osama bin Laden?
Osama bin Laden?
[in Arabic] No, I have no leads.
It's becoming more obvious, Osama never went to the mall.
- So this is a good moisturizer?
- [woman] Yeah.
- lt'll keep my hands really soft?
- Yeah.
- Where can I find Osama bin Laden?
- What?
- You saw him?
- Yes.
Do you know which aisle he was in?
- [laughing]
- Was he down past the Nutella?
Is he in Saudi Arabia?
- Maybe.
- Maybe.
OK.
Maybe you can ask his family.
Maybe they can help you.
- OK.
All right.
- Yeah.
- Cool, I'll do that.
Thanks.
Bye.
- OK.
Bye.
It's a great suggestion.
I'm going to talk to his family.
[ Folkfoot:
Where in the World is Osama bin Laden (Freedom's Call)]
[ Folkfoot:
Where in the World is Osama bin Laden (Freedom's Call)]
OK, this is the Bin Laden Aviation Agency.
How fitting, right?
That's terrible.
Look, I'm not lying.
Right there.
There's the Bin Laden Aviation Agency.
[in Arabic] Where can I marry Osama bin Laden?
- Oh, you don't know?
- [woman] I don't.
[man] Please make sure that you have the correct number.
Your call cannot be completed as dialed.
After 9/1 1, wouldn't you change your number if your last name was bin Laden?
That probably would have been the very first thing I would have done.
I would have been like, "God, Osama, you asshole.
Now I got to change all my phone numbers."
[Morgan] There's a window right there.
[man in Arabic] We would like to ask you some questions about Osama bin Laden.
Yeah.
We're looking for anything.
A phone number, any information we could get.
Anything anybody may know.
He's like, "Do you think he's here?"
I said, "He's not here?" He goes, "Maybe." Maybe!
- He's in the basement.
- Maybe he's in the basement.
I'm looking for Osama bin Laden.
- [laughing]
- Why is that funny?
Why is that funny?
What's wrong with that?
- Where is your car?
- Where is my car?
Why, you going to blow it up or something?
You want to see it?
[Morgan] We're going up to bin Laden's farm.
We're going to go to his place, this house that he built with his own hands.
We're going to talk to people in the village, see if somebody can get me in.
[speaking Arabic]
- [Morgan] That guy said this was it.
- [man] Yeah.
- Not much of a farm.
Look at this.
- Yeah.
It's like a trailer park.
This must be the house.
Let's go.
Let's get out of here.
Man, I should have bought some sandals.
[Morgan] Well, I didn't find OBL, or any good clues in the desert of Saudi Arabia.
But that night I did find Othman Ya al Bari, who's related to one of the 9/1 1 hijackers.
Hopefully, he could point me in the right direction.
He's got professional wrestling on TV, he knows what's good, see?
One of your relatives was said to be one of the hijackers.
- [in Arabic] Yes.
- Yeah.
Was he?
No.
After 9/1 1, there was video of a lot of the hijackers.
A lot of them released video statements.
Do you not think that connects them in some way to what happened?
I don't believe that is solid proof.
America wins all the Oscar awards.
It owns the best studios and technologies in the world.
We've seen the animals, the lion, the dog and the pig, we've seen them in many movies talking like humans.
I feel very uncomfortable with this conversation.
What do you think would drive some people towards wanting to join a group like Al-Qaeda?
What would make them want to go off and fight, possibly lose their lives?
They go because they feel like America... you feel like...
She's trying all kinds of ways to dominate and impose her dominance on the entire world, especially on the Muslim world.
Have you had friends who have gone off to wage jihad?
Yes, of course.
Where did they go?
These youth went first to Afghanistan.
Then America went into Iraq, and they followed.
How many people do you know that went?
- A lot.
- [man] A lot.
And how many have come back?
Unfortunately, nobody came back.
[beeping]
[Morgan] Afghanistan is a country at war for more than 30 years, and it feels like it.
From when the Soviet Union invaded, to civil war, to the Taliban, and now the arrival of U. S. and NATO forces, its impact is everywhere.
Wherever you go there's barricades, barbed wire, people with guns, checkpoints, more people with guns.
And, in the middle of all this, is just this incredible poverty.
I thought the first place to look in Afghanistan for Osama was the last place that he was seen.
So we're heading out to Tora Bora.
They say, "No, no, it's not dangerous at all,"
yet there's 21 guys here with guns...
[laughs] taking us to Tora Bora.
"No, it's fine.
You're not gonna need to worry about it at all."
[Arabic music plays]
Are there a lot of landmines in this area?
[in foreign language] No, not on the path...
- Really?
- Really.
OK.
[Morgan] So, this area here, this was the beginning of Al-Qaeda's base?
[man in Arabic] This is where Osama's headquarters was.
There are large caves on this side and the other side too.
They were full of ammunition, weapons, and food such as tea, sugar and rice.
Look, up there, should we go?
One of our soldiers is shaking the nuts off the tree, 'cause, apparently, if you eat 20 of these nuts...
All night long.
It's the word on the street.
You can rock and roll all night.
Look at that, we got a guy up in the tree to get the magic nuts.
Dude, look at that.
While these guys are playing with their nuts, I think I'll head out on my own.
President Bush said that he wanted to capture Osama bin Laden dead or alive.
The U. S. had its best chance in late November of 2001, when elements of both Afghan and American forces closed in on Osama's mountain hideout.
The following days saw some of the heaviest fighting in all of the war.
Yoo-hoo!
Osama!
And, rather than commit additional U. S. ground forces, the U. S. chose to rely on local Afghan fighters to bring in OBL.
When the dust had settled, Osama was gone.
The governor of the province has ideas how to bring the excitement back.
[in foreign language] Our plan and goal is that Tora Bora should become an international tourism center.
So we want to build a grand amusement park in Tora Bora.
What kind of rides?
Everything will be built.
Maybe a roller coaster.
Everything will be built.
- Water slides?
- Absolutely.
- Ferris wheels?
All of it?
- Yes.
Yes.
You could say, "Tora Bora.
It's the bomb."
[crickets chirping]
[Morgan] I'm not sure how much fun Afghanistan is ready for.
Seems to me they could use a lot more than just roller coasters around here.
[in foreign language] No one has done anything for us.
All the international aid goes to those at the top.
It never makes its way down to us.
You got a tent from the UN.
No, we bought it in the black market!
- No, we buy it in the black market.
- [laughing]
They haven't helped us with land, money or to fix our tent or anything.
Look at this troublemaker!
When we're traveling at night, we have to constantly check the camel to make sure we didn't leave him somewhere.
Have you left him behind before?
Yeah, all the time!
We've lost them many times!
Our lives already passed.
We are concerned about our children.
They should be able to have a better life.
[man] The international community is failing to help this country get on its feet.
Organizations such as USA gauge success by how much money they spend.
Not by what it achieves.
The bigger budget they have, the more impressed they are.
The fact that it doesn't achieve anything, all the clinics don't exist, no one seems to care back in the States, that information doesn't get there.
[in foreign language] No one is helping this place, and if there is, no one is distributing it.
There are more than 800 houses here but no school or hospital.
We are living the same now as we were under the Taliban.
America must hold our government accountable.
America must ask why didn't you pave the streets with the money we gave you.
All those houses were destroyed by foreign countries.
Why don't they rebuild those houses?
They haven't done anything positive here.
Two years ago, the U.S. Ambassador came here and said,
"We're going to make a pledge to rebuild the school." It's been two years.
Look at this place.
This is hearts and minds.
It looks like a bomb went off yesterday.
There's bullet holes.
The front of the building is riddled with bullet holes.
Blast holes.
Nothing's being done.
We've got to do something for these kids.
We've gotta do something for these kids to say, "Somebody cares about us.
Somebody cares about us getting educated.
Somebody wants us to be in a safe environment."
[Morgan] As somebody about to become a father for the first time, it's so instilling in me, reminding me, of the things that I want for my family.
I don't ever want my child to be in a position where they can't be educated.
Or can't feel like they can better themselves, like that this is it.
That this is as good as it gets for their life, and to not have hope that tomorrow is going to be better.
- [phone ringing]
- Ow.
- [phone ringing]
- Ow.
Man, this baby starts kicking as soon as your phone rings.
- Baby knew I was calling.
- We miss you.
Baby knew.
Ow!
- Oh, I miss you so much.
- Yeah.
Me, too.
[Morgan] I dreamt we had a girl last night.
[woman] That's cute.
[Morgan] Ever see Osama bin Laden around here?
[in foreign language] God know, if we catch him, we will tear him apart.
Osama bin Laden's Afghan's enemies.
[in foreign language] Who is Osama?
He is the one who destroyed those buildings in America.
Fuck him.
And fuck America.
I'm looking for Osama bin Laden.
- Pakistan.
- Pakistan?
- Pakistan.
- OK!
Pakistan?
Pakistan.
[in foreign language] It is very obvious to the world that he is hiding in Pakistan.
You should find him so we have peace in the world.
[Morgan] I'm looking for Osama bin Laden.
[in foreign language] Tribal area.
Near Peshawar?
[heart beat on speaker]
That is so cool.
I love you so much.
I love you too, baby.
[imitating heartbeat]
That was my baby's little disco heartbeat.
What will happen if I go to Pakistan to look for him?
[in foreign language] You will find him.
I will find him?
You want to come look for him with me?
No?
[laughing]
Why not?
I'll miss my family.
- [man] I'm gonna miss my family.
- You'll miss your family.
I miss my family very much.
If I went into the tribal area, you think I'd be OK?
[in foreign language] God knows what will happen if you go there.
Something terrible will happen to you.
You're finished.
The Taliban will cut your head.
- They'll cut my head?
Yeah.
- Yeah.
Ugh!
So Alex started getting contractions last night.
Braxton Hicks contractions, which aren't real contractions, but it's your body preparing for a contraction.
And, here I am, missing it all.
And, here I am, missing it all.
Missing it all, man, missing it all.
[man singing in Arabic]
[Morgan] We just found out from U.S. military that we can go out on an embed.
And it's frightening.
But the most important thing, for me, is to try and, hopefully, just narrow down the path to finding the most wanted man on the planet.
How much they're actually looking for this guy, who knows?
But we'll find out.
This stuff is so heavy.
Everything in your body tells you you shouldn't be going to a job, or doing something where you gotta wear a bulletproof vest.
[man] The next thing you'll see here in America you'll see terrorism.
If you don't think you'll see, you're blinding yourself to the historic development of everything taking place on this earth.
Terrorism.
Terrorism.
[man] First of all, I'd like to welcome all of you guys to Firebase Apache.
- What questions do you have?
- Will we be able to speak to any of the people in the area who actually live in the local villages?
Um, when you go out to 4-2, yeah.
- There's a village right next to them.
- OK.
And that village also happens to be full of Taliban.
[woman] I'd like to remind you, while talking about going outside the wire.
When whoever we're with, whoever's escorting us says, "Let's go,"
get in the vehicle and go.
It doesn't mean finish your question.
It means go now.
[Leppert] This is hardcore Taliban country, let me tell you.
Over those mountains, that's Afghanistan.
If you go over those mountains, that's Pakistan.
We're centrally located with a lot of activity around us.
[Morgan] Will we stop in a village tomorrow?
- Yes, we will.
- What's the plan for the afternoon?
We're fogbound, we'll test fire weapons, talk, whatever you want.
You've got free rein.
I had a lot of grouping right beside the guy.
Well, if nothing else, it scared the hell out of him.
Can I try a rocket launcher?
[laughing] That was awesome.
You've been here six months.
You might be able to tell me.
Where is Osama bin Laden?
[Leppert] We ask that every time we go out.
"Hey?
You guys know where Osama's at?" They always point up to the mountains.
[in foreign language] Where's Osama?
[laughter]
- [Morgan] Where's Osama bin Laden?
- I have no clue.
Is he alive?
Even if he was, I don't think we'd know.
We are going to stop and speak to villagers.
They said I should write my blood type on anything that'd be attached to me.
Scary as shit, man.
What we're concentrating on is your security.
That's it.
In a firefight I'm going to come in.
Come to this effect, bring you in and we'll grab you to here.
As soon as I do, I'm going to try to grab you again.
As soon as it's safe, then we're going to move out.
When we go out, we expect to have contact.
We expect to get shot at.
Anything goes out there.
We always got to be ready for everything.
[man] This is what we call a "friendly village."
[laughter] [man] Once they understand it's their choice to talk, the forces will stand back.
And then whoever wants to talk to you will talk to you.
[man] Morgan, come up, let's introduce you.
Yes, sir.
[in foreign language] This person is a civilian from America and wants to ask you some questions.
His name is Morgan.
[Morgan] I was hoping you could tell me your thoughts on the Taliban and the current conflict happening.
[in foreign language] What do you think, who is happy with battles?
No one is happy with battles.
We are not happy.
We don't like the war.
We want a peaceful life.
We are neither your friends nor the Taliban's.
We just want a simple life.
What are things, when you look at your village, you need the most?
In terms of assistance.
The most important problem is the lack of water.
Before the base drilled their well we didn't have any water problems.
- What do you think of Osama bin Laden?
- [man] Morgan!
Let's go now!
Now!
- Come on!
- Let's go now!
[man on radio] Be advised, I've just been informed of an ambush, possibly the governor's convoy.
[man 2] And we are in pursuit of two individuals on foot.
Jedi-1, we're at 2-0-6.
That village to our left is where the Taliban went to.
We have one downed Taliban.
We have their motorcycle in our possession.
Over.
[Morgan] People have said Afghanistan is a winnable war.
What are your thoughts?
In counter-insurgency, killing doesn't work.
Got to work on the center of gravity, the people.
They like having clean water, having a medical clinic.
They like seeing their kids go to school.
It just makes it more difficult for the Taliban to change the tide and get the people to go to the other side.
[in foreign language] Thank you and please tell your commander the father of Taza Gui says peace.
[Morgan] What would have happened if we had sent more troops here in 2002?
You would have killed more Taliban, but, I mean, we're killing a lot of Taliban right now.
And they've got the open sieve from the madrassas of Pakistan in the refugee camps that go to these young kids who don't have a job, who have no positive outlook in life.
They sell them with a lot of propaganda.
Tell them they're going to give their family money, bring them here.
- Where is Osama?
- I think he's in Pakistan.
[beeping]
I think it's quite likely that Osama bin Laden is in Pakistan.
[woman] The latest intelligence has always seemed to indicate that he is in Pakistan.
[man] He's probably somewhere along that border region.
- Pakistan.
- Along that border.
Tribal areas of Pakistan.
Senior leadership, number one and two are there.
On the Pakistan border it's particularly dangerous, a region where terror rules.
And where many believe Osama bin Laden could be hiding.
Everyone I've spoken to said this is where Osama's hiding out.
[Morgan] Everyone, that is, except for Pakistanis.
- Where is Osama?
- [Morgan] You tell me.
- Where is Osama?
- I'm looking for him.
You tell me.
[in foreign language] He's in Afghanistan.
Osama bin Laden is here.
Afghanistan.
Osama bin Laden...
Which animal is that?
I don't where he is, but it's also a question if he's alive or dead.
But, um, his influence is here.
[in foreign language] He is a great soldier of the Muslims.
He is fighting for righteousness.
He's a diamond.
Osama is exploiting the root causes.
If we find the root causes, we'll solve everything.
- Osama bin Laden is nothing, sir.
- He is only one!
One person!
Dude, look at that.
Even in Pakistan they love wrestling.
- All the people like the wrestling.
- Tell me why you like wrestling.
- Because wrestling is fair.
- Can I let you in on a little secret?
- It's fixed.
- Fixed?
- Fixed.
It's not real.
- Maybe.
- You are right.
I know.
You are right.
- OK.
Good.
But when it is for a belt, then it is not fixed.
I'm looking, uh...
How are you?
How are you?
Hi.
I'm just looking...
[Morgan] Just based on what everybody has said, I got to think we're within a couple hundred miles of where he is.
Maybe even less.
Yeah, OK.
OK.
Thank you.
Tomorrow we're heading into this area of the tribal regions, just past Peshawar, where everyone has told me Osama bin Laden is.
I mean, I have no idea what to expect when I get there.
I've been traveling for months to try and find this person that everybody we talk to...
You know, they all say,
"Why are you looking for this person?
What is he?
He's one man?"
The thing that I've realized is that this whole trip is a chance to actually go out and see and talk to those people that we're told to be so scared of all the time.
I'm not somebody who thinks we can sit around the campfire and sing Kumbaya, you know?
That's ridiculous.
[laughing]
But I believe that we create these demons within ourselves.
And we create these demons within the media.
And we create these visions that are so beyond reality.
They start feeding themselves after a while.
Our fear just becomes exponential.
They say when you go looking for trouble, you'll find it.
It's not that I'm looking for trouble.
I'm just looking for answers.
And I think I've found a lot.
I think I've found a lot on this trip.
"Attention.
Entry of foreigners is prohibited beyond this point."
Even if I go over the border to find Osama, it's not going to, suddenly, make the world safer for my kid.
The things that are pushing people to follow him and his ideas are still going to be there.
And that's what we have to change.
I think that we need to take a step back and really ask ourselves, "What kind of a world do we want to live in?
What do we want that world to be?"
It's not worth it.
So her water just broke, which is very exciting.
So, I'm that much closer.
- OK.
- OK?
You want to get up?
[Alex groaning] [laughter]
[woman] It's your son!
- [Morgan] It's a boy!
- [Alex] We have a baby boy!
- We have a baby boy.
- Oh, my God!
He's beautiful.
- [crying] - [laughter]
[Morgan] So, I didn't end up finding Osama.
What I did find, is that there are a lot more people out there who are just like us, than there are who are just like him.
I'll always bet on the billions of regular people to win over the crazies.
After all, we all want the same things for our families.
We want the world to be a place where we can raise and love our kids.
Where they can have everything they need to be happy, healthy, without it blowing up around them.
It's not going to be easy.
And all that reward money sure would have helped but, hey, you know what?
He's going to love public school.
[ Elvis Costello The Attractions:
(What's so Funny 'Bout) Peace Love and Understanding]
If you learn where he is, I beg you, let me know.
I just want to make sure he is OK.
He won't let me know by phone because you kill people with the phone.
The Russians killed the president of Chechnya with the phone, and you Americans have killed people with the phone.
This, a telephone, has become a lethal weapon!
I would like to tell you something, the hungry who cannot find bread to eat in Afghanistan they wouldn't accept these $25 million of yours to turn in a Muslim they know is waging jihad for them.
The seed that was sown by America, a seed of spitefulness, hate, aggression and killing, cannot disappear in the short term.
There has to be another foreign policy to uproot this seed.
The Americans are known to be fighting the Egyptians, Palestinians and Iraqis.
You want to occupy Egypt.
They are good people, but we reject the American foreign policy.
These would be the minority, the rotten type.
Every society has the same.
Every society has good and bad.
We love the American people, but we hate the American government.
We pray to God to destroy you because of what's happening.
OK, I don't want you to be there when it happens.
Have a smell.
While we are living in these troubled times, we need to be merciful.
So get mercy through praises and prayers upon Him because He is mercy.
And He puts compassion in your heart.
We have honored the children of heaven.
He might be somewhere here in Morocco.
How should I know?
Centuries.
It is not from Islam to kill innocent people or to blow yourself up.
I'm disgusted by that.
We don't want them to get involved with that kind of crowd.
That's why we have to take care of them financially.
Americans are causing all the trouble in the world.
But this is my opinion of the American government, not the American people.
These are all the problems that Bush created.
I heard that they want to eradicate Islam.
Osama bin Laden, look how many people he's killed, how many have died.
And what has he accomplished?
Islam obligates us to be this way, to be brothers with everyone.
You should take care of your wife.
If your relationship is based on love and good values, you will have good children.
It's like a sardine.
I'm glad.
Eat with good health.
I want my kids to get an education.
The people who aren't educated won't accomplish anything in their life.
She teases me.
Sometimes she and the kids gang up on me.
When you have your child they will do the same to you.
You can't get well educated living here, because of the poverty.
Those people do not belong to Islam.
Even the terrorism that happened here was masterminded abroad.
The people who blew themselves up were tempted, some tempted by money and some by Paradise.
It is much harder for this generation than it was for my generation.
Violence is birthed by the economic dead ends that confront our youth who happen to be Muslim with an Islamic outlook.
I believe that there is an enormous anger with American policy.
It's too bad it's the American people who have to pay for that anger.
And so we have the obligation not to fail our future, we have to reach out to each other, ignore official political lines and create unofficial bridges between civilian societies in order to bring about change.
If it were truly Osama bin Laden, who did that, then he dealt us a bad hand.
He legitimized the American presence in the Middle East.
He was the reason for the adoption of all the anti-terrorist laws that have pushed us further under the yoke of our own local political leaders.
I was astonished on many levels.
It's horrible.
Ours is not a religious conflict.
We don't fight the Jews because they are Jews.
No, we fight them because they occupy our lands.
And Al-Qaeda, it holds all of the West as an enemy.
Any Arab leader, all Arab movements have adopted the Palestinian issue because they know the Palestinian issue is what triggers the emotions and nationalistic feelings in all Arab and Muslim people.
Without the Palestinian issue, they won't get any attention on the global level.
It is strategic on their part to adopt the Palestinian issue.
If this was happening in Israel,
America and all the other countries would protest it.
I wish we had somebody like Osama bin Laden in Palestine.
Just to destroy the state of Israel.
They can come and take over my home, where I live, by force.
What can I do?
I can't do anything.
The suspicious object is here, past the garbage can.
Listen up.
Good evening to everyone.
There is a suspicious object there.
I am asking everyone who is in this area of Allenby and the area of the boardwalk to move away from the area.
The man on the hotel balcony, get inside.
Everyone is requested to be behind the police gates.
Pay attention.
This is the bomb squad.
I am about to conduct a controlled explosion on the suspicious object.
Yes.
Get out of here!
This is not your land.
Get the hell out of here!
Get out of here!
I'm going to break this.
Out of here, get out of here, get out of here!
Go off!
Go off!
Go off!
- No Jewish.
Al-Qaeda attacked New York and Washington on September 11th.
Because Al-Qaeda can't fight the U.S. on its soil, they drew them to Arabic land so that they will fight them here.
After Afghanistan, Al-Qaeda didn't have anywhere to operate.
If the United States hadn't entered Iraq,
Al-Qaeda wouldn't be the same as they are now.
It would have ended by the end of Afghanistan.
The psychology of the Arabs and Muslims is to side with whoever fights the occupier.
Nothing.
Nothing whatsoever.
Zarqawi was killed and nothing happened.
And if bin Laden and Zawahiri got killed, nothing will happen.
Because Al-Qaeda has become an intercontinental idea, the same as globalization.
O God, one leader to lead jihad for your sake.
To liberate the land of Palestine.
And the land of Iraq from the Christians.
O God, the strong and noble one.
O God, go after the Christians.
O God, make wars in their homes.
O God, release your armies upon them.
O God, make the land of Palestine a graveyard for the Jews.
O God, make the land of Iraq a graveyard for the Christians.
Well, look at what you did in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Was it an act of aggression or not?
You went there with an ambulance or with a tank?
If one man in a cave was able to do this...
What if all Muslims were to resist against America under the leadership of one man?
See, but I don't think 1.2 billion Muslims think the same way you think.
One single verse from the Koran and they will come.
These things get planned.
Don't disregard it as unlikely.
What if we were to burn the refineries, just to deprive you of the oil?
Great.
We have no worries or troubles.
Actually, we did not study the United States specifically.
I have no definite opinion...
no specific opinion.
No answer.
Their view is...
Americans always want to dominate...
No, that was the wrong answer...
Stop your cameras.
They want to stop.
Yes.
Excuse me, I was wondering if we could ask you a question?
Excuse me, I was wondering if you guys could help me?
No?
No, I have no leads.
Where can I marry Osama bin Laden?
- [woman] I don't.
Please make sure that you have the correct number.
Your call cannot be completed as dialed.
We would like to ask you some questions about Osama bin Laden.
[speaking Arabic]
Yes.
No.
I don't believe that is solid proof.
America wins all the Oscar awards.
It owns the best studios and technologies in the world.
We've seen the animals, the lion, the dog and the pig, we've seen them in many movies talking like humans.
They go because they feel like America... you feel like...
She's trying all kinds of ways to dominate and impose her dominance on the entire world, especially on the Muslim world.
Yes, of course.
These youth went first to Afghanistan.
Then America went into Iraq, and they followed.
- A lot.
- [man] A lot.
Unfortunately, nobody came back.
[Arabic music plays]
No, not on the path...
- Really?
- Really.
This is where Osama's headquarters was.
There are large caves on this side and the other side too.
They were full of ammunition, weapons, and food such as tea, sugar and rice.
Look, up there, should we go?
Our plan and goal is that Tora Bora should become an international tourism center.
So we want to build a grand amusement park in Tora Bora.
Everything will be built.
Everything will be built.
Absolutely.
No one has done anything for us.
All the international aid goes to those at the top.
It never makes its way down to us.
No, we bought it in the black market!
- No, we buy it in the black market.
They haven't helped us with land, money or to fix our tent or anything.
Look at this troublemaker!
When we're traveling at night, we have to constantly check the camel to make sure we didn't leave him somewhere.
Yeah, all the time!
We've lost them many times!
Our lives already passed.
We are concerned about our children.
They should be able to have a better life.
No one is helping this place, and if there is, no one is distributing it.
There are more than 800 houses here but no school or hospital.
We are living the same now as we were under the Taliban.
America must hold our government accountable.
America must ask why didn't you pave the streets with the money we gave you.
All those houses were destroyed by foreign countries.
Why don't they rebuild those houses?
They haven't done anything positive here.
God know, if we catch him, we will tear him apart.
Osama bin Laden's Afghan's enemies.
Who is Osama?
Fuck him.
And fuck America.
- Pakistan.
- Pakistan.
- OK!
Pakistan.
It is very obvious to the world that he is hiding in Pakistan.
You should find him so we have peace in the world.
Tribal area.
You will find him.
I'll miss my family.
I'm gonna miss my family.
God knows what will happen if you go there.
Something terrible will happen to you.
You're finished.
The Taliban will cut your head.
Yeah.
[man singing in Arabic]
Morgan, come up, let's introduce you.
Yes, sir.
This person is a civilian from America and wants to ask you some questions.
His name is Morgan.
What do you think, who is happy with battles?
No one is happy with battles.
We are not happy.
We don't like the war.
We want a peaceful life.
We are neither your friends nor the Taliban's.
We just want a simple life.
The most important problem is the lack of water.
Before the base drilled their well we didn't have any water problems.
Thank you and please tell your commander the father of Taza Gui says peace.
He's in Afghanistan.
Osama bin Laden is here.
Afghanistan.
Osama bin Laden...
Which animal is that?
He is a great soldier of the Muslims.
He is fighting for righteousness.
He's a diamond.
Osama is exploiting the root causes.
If we find the root causes, we'll solve everything.
- Osama bin Laden is nothing, sir.
- He is only one!
One person!
- OK.
Good.
But when it is for a belt, then it is not fixed.
[Elvis Costello The Attractions:
(What's so Funny 'Bout) Peace Love and Understanding]
You ever wake up in the morning and think,
"Man, life is good.
I mean, it just can't get any better than this."
It's all beautiful and perfect and wonderful and amazing, and then, one day, that one thing happens that changes everything.
- I'm pregnant.
- That's only one test.
Oh, boy.
What kind of a world am I bringing a kid into?
They say the most important job a father has is to keep his baby safe.
But how am I going to do that?
I can cover the electrical sockets, or childproof Mommy's pill bottles, but that's just inside the house.
What about out there?
There's cults, muggers, drugs, violence.
Not to mention all of the predators now lurking about.
I could move from the East Village to a family friendly neighborhood in Brooklyn, but is that enough to keep my child safe?
And what about the big things?
Things like hurricanes, earthquakes or tsunamis?
And that's just that mean, old, Mother Nature.
What about the really big things?
Things we should really be afraid of.
Like the most wanted man on the planet.
What about him?
We've got the strongest military, sneakiest spies and coolest technology in the entire world, but we can't find one man hiding in
Afghanibaluchapakiwaziristan?
After 9/11, I thought some satellite would shoot a laser down onto the earth, fry up an omelet bin Laden and save us all.
But that wasn't the case.
I know, maybe he's dead.
But maybe he's alive.
Maybe he's on dialysis.
Maybe he's a nine foot bionic ninja with X- ray vision and the power of flight.
All I know is that in the last six years, there've been more acts of terrorism, worldwide, than in 20 years leading up to it.
Today, there are known terrorist cells in more than 100 countries around the world.
By the time my kid's out of diapers, everyone's gonna be a terrorist.
Nowhere's gonna be safe.
With Operation Special Delivery only 19 weeks away,
I just can't sit around and do nothing.
If the CIA and the FBI can't find him, and I'm going to make this world safe for my child, it's time for a new plan.
If I've learned anything from big budget action movies, it's that complicated global problems are best solved by one lonely guy crazy enough to think he can fix everything before the credits roll.
And I'm going to find out once and for all:
Where in the world is Osama bin Laden?
Moustache ride.
Reign of Terror!
I'm gonna get you, Osama been hiding.
I wanted to talk to you because I'm getting ready to do a lot of travel.
I wanted to see if I'm going to need any shots, anything...
Where are you going to be going?
We're going to go look for Osama bin Laden.
OK.
You'll probably find him.
Um, you're going to need a whole bunch of shots and prescriptions.
- You want to do it, want to go for it?
- I'm going to need it all, right?
- How many shots am I getting?
- Diphtheria, tetanus, polio.
Typhoid, meningitis, hepatitis A and B.
This one I must tell you about.
This is your yellow fever.
About one in one million people who get the yellow fever shot, get a very, very bad reaction.
They get multi-system organ failure.
There are six reported cases or more, maybe seven or eight.
And about four of them died.
Going to need more than shots to keep me safe in the places I'm heading to.
This is reality-based personal protection, teaching you how to survive explosions, small arms attacks, sniper attacks, chemical attacks.
We cover it all.
We're going to simulate a hand grenade attack.
Boom!
You would have been killed.
I'll show you how to survive.
The first thing you want to do is turn away from the grenade and dive.
You're in a perfect position.
This is going to save your life by 98 percent.
When someone's head explodes, that's what it looks like.
Even though it's tragic, we can't focus on this, we got to think about survival.
Look at the wall there.
What do you see?
- I see blood.
- OK, good.
We have the "blood splatter."
How do we determine where the sniper is at, based on our situation here?
Hold up a hat on a stick.
If I'm in a restaurant, I don't want to sit in the middle.
If a gunman came, where is he most likely to hit?
You're dead here.
This is what we call the "fatal funnel."
You want to stay behind that line, you want to stay off the wall.
You're dead here.
You're dead here.
Any time you leave your vehicle, you gotta assume, in dangerous places, someone could plant a bomb on your vehicle.
You're dead here.
You're dead here.
Here's what I recommend, you go around the corner, and then you can pull it open, and if it doesn't go boom, you can go check it out.
Gonna be the most paranoid person in the Middle East.
Maybe that's a good thing.
Because if I'm going to find Osama,
I'm traveling to scary places.
In the last year, the State Department issued over 100 warnings about traveling to the Middle East.
Mainly because Americans are now bigger targets for kidnapping and murder.
Now we're going to have a little classroom time about kidnapping.
Here are some basics of surviving as a hostage.
You got to accept it and start planning on how you're going to survive it.
Speak only if spoken to.
- Is this the crew's, the cameraman's?
- No.
Don't provoke the captors.
Don't stare at them.
Don't have a harsh tone of voice.
Don't be argumentative.
Don't have an attitude.
These people are in control, not you.
This is not a fucking game.
Especially when you're in Baghdad, Kabul, or you're in Turkey, this stuff is going on daily, and you gotta be prepared for it.
I'm usually a pretty calm person when it comes to crazy shit happening around me.
But that's a whole other level of crazy.
We wage a war to save a civilization itself.
They hate us, our country.
They hate the liberties for which we stand.
Until you catch the chicken, you don't have the chicken.
Go, go, go!
Want you to get used to the sound of the language.
Oh, good, Wow.
Go for the eyes.
The eyes!
Are you going to convert to Muslim or not?
Shoot him, shoot him.
I recommend you wear the clothes.
Maybe you can hit the tanning salon a little bit.
Grenade!
Somebody said I should grow my beard out?
Yeah, for you.
Because you obviously look very foreign.
- Look at this area.
Much bigger, right?
- This guy is probably alive.
You could have a situation where a device explodes and it gets on you.
Oh, fuck!
I brought you these outfits.
Hopefully, it keeps you safe.
This is a normal reaction.
He's fine.
How do I say, "Don't take me, take the cameraman?"
He's alive!
You have to know the way an Islamic terrorist thinks.
Jim's right.
I need to learn how Osama thinks.
To find a fox, you need to think like a fox.
I need to get inside his head and learn what makes him tick.
I need to explore the world he comes from.
Meet the people who influenced him.
Visit the places that shaped him into who he is today.
And, most of all, I need to try to understand what drives an Osama bin Laden to begin with.
I know just the place to start.
Egypt is the birthplace of one of the heaviest hitters in the world of terrorism.
Ayman Al-Zawahiri.
He's Al-Qaeda's Team Manager and Osama's personal mentor.
His stats are pretty impressive.
He was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood at the age of 14.
He's a life-long follower of Sayyid Qutb, the man credited with creating modern day Islamic fundamentalism, is currently the number two of Al-Qaeda, and he's a Gemini.
And I got a tip where to find his uncle, Mahfouz Azzam.
If he can tell me where the A-man is, odds are Osama won't be too far away.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Mahfouz?
- It's nice to see you.
Welcome.
- Nice to see you.
- Thank you.
- Please.
- It's a beautiful day today.
Very nice.
- Yeah.
- So do you know where he is?
- No.
Where do you think he is?
If you learn where he is, I beg you, let me know.
I just want to make sure he is OK.
He won't let me know by phone because you kill people with the phone.
The Russians killed the president of Chechnya with the phone, and you Americans have killed people with the phone.
This, a telephone, has become a lethal weapon!
And every month my bank account gets killed by my phone.
Which makes it even worse.
So, if you knew where he was, you wouldn't turn him in for the $25,000,000?
I would like to tell you something, the hungry who cannot find bread to eat in Afghanistan they wouldn't accept these $25 million of yours to turn in a Muslim they know is waging jihad for them.
So he's in Afghanistan?
- You say so.
- You said so.
You just told me.
America says so.
America says so.
- Do you think he's in Afghanistan?
- America says.
So if Al-Zawahiri and Osama bin Laden just disappeared tomorrow, would things change?
The seed that was sown by America, a seed of spitefulness, hate, aggression and killing, cannot disappear in the short term.
There has to be another foreign policy to uproot this seed.
It's easy to criticize American foreign policy, with the second most wanted terrorist in the family.
I should find regular folks who might be more objective.
What do you guys hear about Americans?
The Americans are known to be fighting the Egyptians, Palestinians and Iraqis.
We're fighting you?
- Yes.
- Really?
I didn't even know that.
What are we fighting the Egyptians for?
You want to occupy Egypt.
Do we?
Why?
We're not that well versed in politics but that's what we hear on TV and stuff.
What do you think about America?
They are good people, but we reject the American foreign policy.
How can he be against American foreign policy?
Egypt is one of our best friends in the region and in the global war on terror.
At the same time, it was home to five of the founding fathers of Al-Qaeda.
The guy who tried to blow up the World Trade Center in '93, and the ringleader of the 9/11 hijackings.
Maybe university students could tell me why Osama's making so many friends here.
It's about oppression, because Egypt is a developing country, so, like, the people who are oppressed are kind of more...
So it develops more terrorists, and that's it.
These would be the minority, the rotten type.
Every society has the same.
Every society has good and bad.
In Egypt, people have no freedom.
And they try and prove to the government that they have freedom, deserve freedom, by committing terrorist attacks.
Did you vote in the last presidential election?
- No.
- No.
- You weren't old enough yet?
- It's not that.
I don't believe in it.
I know it's rigged.
I know that Hosni Mubarak would have won anyway.
They call this a democratic country, but it's not.
In Egypt, if a president wants to stay in power, he'll stay in power.
And Hosni Mubarak has been in power for more than 26 years.
The United States has got a close and meaningful relationship with Egypt.
This relationship is a cornerstone for our policy in the Middle East.
Policy that includes giving Mubarak an aid package, while looking the other way as he uses riot police and hired thugs armed with sticks, knives, swords and Molotov cocktails to keep the opposition from voting on election day.
You might say about Mubarak the same thing FDR said about another dictator.
He may be a son of a bitch, but he's our son of a bitch.
See, we've had a policy of propping up dictators for more than 50 years now.
When the Cold War started heating up, we decided to do what it took to stop communism from taking over.
And the United States started mixing with a rougher crowd.
Hmm!
In 1953, the CIA helped the Shah of Iran overthrow the Iranian government, to become their supreme ruler.
Sure, the Shah tortured or killed anyone who publicly disagreed with him.
Even went as far as shoving broken glass up the nether regions of critics.
But he totally hated Communism.
Now, he was a son of a bitch, but he was our son of a bitch.
The Shah kept Iran in our corner until 1979, when Ayatollah Khomeini's Islamic revolution swept to power, and held 52 Americans hostage for 15 months.
That's when we made friends with Saddam Hussein over in Iraq.
Now, he was an SOB too, but for ten years, while he was fighting the Iranians, he was our SOB.
In fact, by the mid-'80s, we had sons of bitches all the way from Latin America to the Middle East, but, hey, pimping freedom ain't easy.
We needed to keep our SOBs happy and on our side.
So we provided them with tanks, guns, planes and more money.
Today we give Egypt more than 2 billion dollars a year in weapons and aid.
Sure, there's torture, murder and rampant political corruption, but somewhere along the way we decided that, in order to protect our own freedom, it was all right to sacrifice the freedom of others.
Does lack of democracy, human rights, in countries like Egypt encourage people to get involved in extremist radical groups?
Of course.
There's no doubt about this.
It's the one thing that I agree with George W. Bush about.
That people join terrorist organizations because there is no other way to be active.
The threat of terrorism created the climate of fear that is being exploited by the Mubarak regime and by George Bush.
We're going through a very difficult time now.
I mean, we have terrorists on one side, and opportunist, exploitative regimes on the other side.
The U.S. can no longer claim the moral ground.
People have learned to expect a lot less from the U.S. than they used to.
The United States is the main problem in the region, frankly.
We love the American people, but we hate the American government.
We pray to God to destroy you because of what's happening.
America's filled with people who want people to live peacefully, to co-exist together, just like me.
OK, I don't want you to be there when it happens.
Have a smell.
You know, being in the States, all we get on the news are the crazy nuts that like to scream, "Death to you!"
And so you're like, "Oh, man.
Go get them."
But we've been in Egypt for a week now, talking to people, who are real people, just like you and me.
One after another after another everybody said,
"This government's corrupt and it's backed by the U.S."
It's hard for me to see how damaged the image of the country that I love and care about has become.
- Hello?
- I got your postcard from Egypt today.
Oh, nice.
You sound good.
I am good.
Just promise you'll be here when it's really important.
OK?
I promise.
He has to be back by the first week of November, because I'm due the end of November, early December.
And, if he misses that, I'm going to be so upset.
And he's going to be upset.
But, also, he's going to these places that are so dangerous.
And I don't want him to miss anything.
And I don't want him to get hurt.
While we are living in these troubled times, we need to be merciful.
So get mercy through praises and prayers upon Him because He is mercy.
And He puts compassion in your heart.
As a Muslim I am taught that God has honored humankind.
He did not say he honored Muslims and everyone else is a second class citizen.
We have honored the children of heaven.
Your average Egyptian's struggling like your average American to make ends meet, to get a decent job, provide for his family, educate his kids.
The same concerns all over.
Torek is an Egyptian-American studying law at Al Azhar University.
He's a new dad and wants the world's view of Islam to change for the sake of his young son.
We need to rectify this,
Muslims are over one fifth of the world population.
That's a lot of people.
It's not some Polynesian island somewhere.
That's a lot of people!
If four-fifths of the world are scared of one-fifth, what kind of civilization and humanity are we gonna have?
Now they're going to think all we do is pray.
- Even the kids!
- I'm working on the voice-over.
From a very young age, they start manipulating the children.
We need to differentiate between extreme factions in a population, and the regular, vast majority of people.
What do you think of the War on Terror?
It's a bogus term.
I don't think it means anything.
I think some guy that had too much to drink in the Pentagon, one night, came up with that.
- Dude, I got a great idea.
- A war on terrorism.
We had a war on drugs.
We didn't win that, either.
But is it really a war on terror?
Have we eradicated terror?
Or are we exporting terror?
I think that...
Unfortunately, I think that we're exporting it.
I think that we lit the flame on a bomb.
The bomb Torek is speaking of is the explosive rise in terrorist attacks during the last seven years.
Al-Qaeda has now become a global franchise, serving up an unhealthy dose of j ihad to more and more people each year.
Ooh!
Can I help you?
Despite the U.S. spending over $500 billion fighting the war on terror,
Al-Qaeda continues to find new markets to expand into.
Thanks to heavy worldwide recruitment, which included having interested people filling out job applications, AQ is now back to its pre-9/11 strength.
Two of the U.S. 's closest allies, Spain and England, were both attacked by homegrown Al-Qaeda cells.
Even Muslim countries are finding they are in Al-Qaeda's crosshairs, often becoming the victims of terrorism and feeling the influence of Osama bin Laden firsthand.
Where is Osama bin Laden?
He might be somewhere here in Morocco.
How should I know?
- Bin Laden?
I am not a politic man.
- Yeah.
I don't know nothing about...
I'm a carpet dealer.
I sell carpet.
How many years has this tannery been here?
Centuries.
What do you think about people who cause violence in the name of Islam?
It is not from Islam to kill innocent people or to blow yourself up.
I'm disgusted by that.
Do you ever worry that your sons may get involved with terrorists?
We worry about that.
We don't want them to get involved with that kind of crowd.
That's why we have to take care of them financially.
Americans are causing all the trouble in the world.
But...
Were the...
But this is my opinion of the American government, not the American people.
These are all the problems that Bush created.
I heard that they want to eradicate Islam.
What do you think about Osama bin Laden?
He's crazy?
Osama bin Laden, look how many people he's killed, how many have died.
And what has he accomplished?
He's accomplished a wave of suicide bombings in Morocco killing more than 50 people over the last four years.
The first attack was in May of 2003, when recruiters outside the country came to town and convinced 14 young men to blow themselves up in exchange for money and the rewards of paradise.
They all grew up on the exact same street in the desperately poor ghetto of Sidi Moumen.
I met journalist Aboubakr Jamai, to find out what'd drive young men to cause such destruction.
I think it's a mix of ingredients.
And, depending on the situation, one of the ingredients is more important than the others.
And, these ingredients, I think in the case of Morocco, the socio-economic ingredient is the most important one.
It's not a coincidence that all of the guys who blew themselves up in the 16th of May, uh, 2003, came from this shantytown.
They were either unemployed or had menial jobs.
And they were completely outcast in their own society.
What do you think is the solution?
The problem in Morocco, with the people here, is that we fail to give them an economic voice and a political voice.
To me, that's the solution.
Need to give opportunity, economically speaking, because extremism nourishes itself from darkness.
That evening I was invited to dinner with Ahmed and his family, in the same 200 square-foot house he grew up in.
Ahmed doesn't want his children to fall prey to the same people the bombers did.
But with a poor education system and little money, he fears they could be exploited.
Thank you for letting us come here.
This is a great thing.
Islam obligates us to be this way, to be brothers with everyone.
I'm about to have a baby in December.
Give me some fatherly advice.
You should take care of your wife.
I've got a good wife, so that's good.
If your relationship is based on love and good values, you will have good children.
Wow.
What kind of fish is that?
It's like a sardine.
It's delicious.
I'm glad.
Eat with good health.
So, I want you to tell me, what do you hope for your kids?
I want my kids to get an education.
The people who aren't educated won't accomplish anything in their life.
How did you do in school?
She's laughing!
She teases me.
Sometimes she and the kids gang up on me.
So do I have that to look forward to?
When you have your child they will do the same to you.
How hard is it to get a good education living in this area?
You can't get well educated living here, because of the poverty.
I'd like to hear your opinion.
When we hear about all these people who... what are your thoughts on those people?
Those people do not belong to Islam.
Even the terrorism that happened here was masterminded abroad.
The people who blew themselves up were tempted, some tempted by money and some by Paradise.
It is much harder for this generation than it was for my generation.
Violence is birthed by the economic dead ends that confront our youth who happen to be Muslim with an Islamic outlook.
How do you feel that we, as Americans, or how do we as a world culture start to end the fighting?
I believe that there is an enormous anger with American policy.
It's too bad it's the American people who have to pay for that anger.
And so we have the obligation not to fail our future, we have to reach out to each other, ignore official political lines and create unofficial bridges between civilian societies in order to bring about change.
What were your thoughts after 9/11 happened?
If it were truly Osama bin Laden, who did that, then he dealt us a bad hand.
He legitimized the American presence in the Middle East.
He was the reason for the adoption of all the anti-terrorist laws that have pushed us further under the yoke of our own local political leaders.
I was astonished on many levels.
It's horrible.
Osama bin Laden says one reason for the creation of Al-Qaeda and attacks against the West, is the existence of Israel,
America's support of her and the treatment of the Palestinian people.
If Osama cares about the Palestinians so much,
I wanted to see if the feeling was mutual.
If it is,
I'm sure someone can help me narrow in on it.
How do you feel about Al-Qaeda causing acts of terrorism
- in the name of the Palestinian people?
- I don't agree with Al-Qaeda.
Yeah.
I'll leave that alone.
I don't agree with them at all.
It is none of their business to do anything for us.
We can do for ourselves.
We are fighting to make our homeland free.
It's none of their business.
I was wondering if you could help?
Looking for Osama bin Laden.
- Go to Tora Bora.
No.
- Not here in Ramallah?
- No?
- They hate Osama bin Laden.
- Palestinians?
- Palestinians.
- And you know, if...
- Why do they hate him?
Because he likes blood.
You know?
He is a ridiculous Muslim.
He gives a bad picture about Islam.
We've heard Hamas is on the same level as Al-Qaeda.
Is that true?
Ours is not a religious conflict.
We don't fight the Jews because they are Jews.
No, we fight them because they occupy our lands.
And Al-Qaeda, it holds all of the West as an enemy.
But the number one reason they say they do it is because of the Palestinian conflict.
Because of what's happening here.
Any Arab leader, all Arab movements have adopted the Palestinian issue because they know the Palestinian issue is what triggers the emotions and nationalistic feelings in all Arab and Muslim people.
But, at the same point, they're using you guys as, like, this battle cry, but they're doing nothing to help you.
That's the reality.
Without the Palestinian issue, they won't get any attention on the global level.
It is strategic on their part to adopt the Palestinian issue.
Unbelievable how many walls are here, the separation.
Everywhere you go there's a wall, a fence, barbed wire.
It's not for a human being.
It's good for a zoo.
If this was happening in Israel,
America and all the other countries would protest it.
- The peace of life, we don't have it.
- Yeah.
And we are living in very big prison.
I wish we had somebody like Osama bin Laden in Palestine.
Just to destroy the state of Israel.
It's a political struggle, a military struggle.
But the biggest thing is this.
All of this is about land.
Scattered through the hills of the Palestinian West Bank, are Israeli settlements, built to expand the Jewish presence in the region.
How does it feel, being overlooked by settlements?
It's not only overlooking us, but we are always under their foot.
They can come and take over my home, where I live, by force.
What can I do?
I can't do anything.
Tears and blood were shed today as Israel began the forced evacuation of Jewish settlers from their homes.
The settlements are a cause of violence between settlers and Palestinians, they are also a contentious issue within Israeli politics.
With one side seeing the settlements as another obstacle in achieving peace, while the other sees it as a divine right.
We Jews are the rightful owner of this land.
- Mm-hmm.
- It was a land that was promised to them by the Almighty, who kept his promise and brought us back.
After we realized there's going to be a struggle about every centimeter of the land, we realized we have to settle on the outposts to enlarge the area.
This outpost, for instance, it's...
- So is that legal to do that?
- It's illegal in the moment, as it is in the process of being legalized.
What is your thought on the Palestinian conflict?
When we were kids, there was this game where you play music
- and there's a circle of chairs.
- Yeah.
Musical chairs.
Musical chairs.
This is a bit like a musical chair tragedy.
Somebody is left without a chair.
But everybody needs to sit somewhere.
Should Israelis move out of the settlements?
israel'll have to let go of the territories.
We are not holding the territories, the territories are holding us.
The tragedy of this place is that everybody knows exactly what would be the solution in the end, the end of the story.
Two countries that are connected, but separated.
And this is the way it's going to end.
Every person in his right mind knows this is the way it's going to end.
One thing we don't know is how many people are going to die, and how much time is going to pass.
But the end is very clear.
- Yeah.
- That's tragic.
Are there politicians working towards a solution?
Yes, there are politicians who are working for peace.
The problem is, if you have three buses exploding in Tel Aviv,
- it will stop.
- Yeah.
And we can progress the peace process once again, and then if a settler in the territories will kill somebody, it will stop again.
And so, we're being held hostage by the extremists from both sides.
So this is basically Israel, and that's the Gaza Strip.
And...
It's pretty...
It's pretty scary.
It is really scary.
Imagine that rolling up over your hill, coming at your house.
Imagine living like this.
Imagine this is how you live every single day.
Oh, shit.
A Qassam touched down next to a daycare center in Sderot this morning.
No one was wounded in the attack, but the Hamas chief warned the rocket attacks on Israel will continue.
So this classroom was blown up about eight and a half hours ago.
Luckily, there were no kids in it.
Rocket came from the Gaza Strip.
If there had been kids in here, half of them would be dead.
You see this and get a sense of how wrong things are.
I can't imagine raising my kid up in a place like this.
I couldn't imagine living in a place where my kid went to school, and this is something that can happen every day.
I think everything's going pretty good with the pregnancy.
Thirty weeks, it's very active, and it's positioned the right way, and everything's good.
Take deep, full breaths into the belly.
I never imagined I would spend my pregnancy like this, separated from my partner, but, then again, before Morgan, I never thought I would have kids, so...
You just never can tell, can you?
Here with the Israeli Police Bomb Squad, they got a call.
Two calls, actually.
Going to check them out.
- Is it right here?
- Yeah.
Right, few feet of us.
Let's go!
The suspicious object is here, past the garbage can.
Listen up.
Good evening to everyone.
There is a suspicious object there.
I am asking everyone who is in this area of Allenby and the area of the boardwalk to move away from the area.
The man on the hotel balcony, get inside.
Everyone is requested to be behind the police gates.
Pay attention.
This is the bomb squad.
I am about to conduct a controlled explosion on the suspicious object.
It's so scary.
And this happens every day.
Eight to ten times a day, he said, sometimes up to 18.
Don't stand near the windows.
Three... two... one.
Go.
There's a bikini inside.
Check it out.
Well, my heart's pounding and it's a bikini.
Nice job, pal.
You did good.
Good job, buddy.
No, come on.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
There'll be plenty more chances.
- Can we ask you questions?
- About what?
- About...
- Political?
- A little bit.
- No, no.
I'd love to hear your thoughts on the current conflict.
It's all an illusion?
Yes.
Wow.
That guy is one of the greatest optimists I've ever seen.
How you doing?
Can I ask you a couple of questions?
So somebody just threw a water balloon at us.
Get the hell out of here!
And now there's a crowd gathering because they're going to chase us away.
They're gathering numbers now.
There's a big flock of people that's going to chase us.
- Go off!
- Get out of here!
This is not your land.
I'm not allowed to talk to anybody in the country?
Get the hell out of here!
- I'd say...
- Get out of here!
...we're not very wanted around here.
I'm going to break this.
This place is no joke.
We were down there just trying to talk to people.
So what you see here, majority of people here don't think like them.
Yeah, I think we've found enough peace here today.
Out of here, get out of here, get out of here!
It is...
It's no joke.
Go off!
Go off!
- I'm going to my car.
- Go off!
Dude.
- Yeah.
- Jewish?
I'm going to my car.
No Jewish.
There's so many things that are wrong on both sides.
If this was solved tomorrow, if, suddenly, there were two states, and people were living in peace, would bin Laden go away?
I don't think it would happen.
What you're doing, is you're taking an argument away.
It isn't.
It's messed up.
There goes my friend.
See you.
How hard is it for you to be in the minority in this region, a Christian in a Muslim country?
I have no problem whatsoever, living with the Muslims.
We are worshipping Allah.
And, uh, I am worshipping the same God, that the Christians and the Muslims and the Jews are worshipping.
The one God.
Religion is being used as a mask to hide the cruelty the ugliness of violence.
Moderates, they are the majority, but their voices are not loud enough.
What are your thoughts on the global war on terror?
9/11 breaks the hearts of every human being, but I think the best way is not to fight only.
You have to look for the root of the problem.
What our American brothers and friends need is a cultural strategy.
Without understanding each other, without this mutual respect, there's no peace.
It's impossible.
Mission is impossible.
Not only is it impossible, it's downright scary.
Just ask journalist Fouad Hussein.
Ten years ago while he was jailed for criticizing Jordan's economic policies, he met Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq.
They remained pen pals up until Zarqawi was killed in 2006.
According to what Zarqawi told him,
America is playing right into Al-Qaeda's hands.
Al-Qaeda attacked New York and Washington on September 11th.
Because Al-Qaeda can't fight the U.S. on its soil, they drew them to Arabic land so that they will fight them here.
Had we left Afghanistan and said "That's it."
You know, "We're done." What would have happened?
After Afghanistan, Al-Qaeda didn't have anywhere to operate.
If the United States hadn't entered Iraq,
Al-Qaeda wouldn't be the same as they are now.
It would have ended by the end of Afghanistan.
The psychology of the Arabs and Muslims is to side with whoever fights the occupier.
If bin Laden would be caught or killed right now,
- would it make any difference?
- Nothing.
Nothing whatsoever.
Zarqawi was killed and nothing happened.
And if bin Laden and Zawahiri got killed, nothing will happen.
Because Al-Qaeda has become an intercontinental idea, the same as globalization.
And that idea is reaching more and more people each day.
With Operation Special Delivery only seven weeks away,
I need to go back to the beginning.
And the beginning for Osama is Saudi Arabia.
Saudi Arabia is a country ruled by one family, and governed by one brand of fundamental Islam, Wahhabism.
Osama was born here.
He went to school here.
And, in the late '70s, he was radicalized here.
O God, one leader to lead jihad for your sake.
To liberate the land of Palestine.
And the land of Iraq from the Christians.
O God, the strong and noble one.
O God, go after the Christians.
O God, make wars in their homes.
O God, release your armies upon them.
O God, make the land of Palestine a graveyard for the Jews.
O God, make the land of Iraq a graveyard for the Christians.
Do you feel America is trying to fight a war against the religion of Islam?
Well, look at what you did in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Well, they went to Afghanistan to get Osama bin Laden.
And the Taliban wouldn't give him up.
Was it an act of aggression or not?
We were seeking peace in Afghanistan.
You went there with an ambulance or with a tank?
That's a good question.
Do you think Osama bin Laden caused 9/11?
If one man in a cave was able to do this...
What if all Muslims were to resist against America under the leadership of one man?
See, but I don't think 1.2 billion Muslims think the same way you think.
One single verse from the Koran and they will come.
So why has no one said that verse yet?
These things get planned.
Don't disregard it as unlikely.
What if we were to burn the refineries, just to deprive you of the oil?
You said Saudi Arabia is a country divided.
What do you mean by that?
Not divided, but not yet building the national unity we are looking for.
One important issue in the Kingdom, is to organize the relation between the religious establishment and the political establishment.
This issue hasn't been resolved yet, and it must be resolved.
Otherwise, extremists, terrorists, may dictate some of their ideologies on us.
And we still have so many people, who are refusing to accept the reality.
Are there still radicals within the country?
We still have a lot.
And they are dangerous, by the way.
We should not underestimate the ability of the extremists.
Those people are ready to die.
Those people are ready to destroy.
Those people are ready to kill themselves, kill their families, they don't care about life.
Therefore, I think they are a threat us, in Saudi Arabia, then to other countries, then to the world.
In an unprecedented nine month operation netting more than 170 Al-Qaeda suspects, and more than five million dollars,
Saudi intelligence officials say they thwarted plans to fly aircraft into oil facilities, attack security installations, kill senior officials and send money to Al-Qaeda in Iraq.
But the raids reveal a far more worrying trend for the Saudis.
The war in Iraq is spilling over into Saudi Arabia.
Right in front of the head office of the Mutawwa'un, the religious police, is Chop Chop Square.
I'm standing right on the drain where they cut people's heads off, and the blood goes into that drain.
Everybody stands around and watches.
They kill people in the morning and then play soccer in the afternoons.
What a place.
It's complete culture shock for me to be in Saudi Arabia.
An absolute other world, from anything I've ever experienced, any place I've ever been.
We've been to Egypt and Morocco and Jordan, and the Palestinian territories, and these places are so progressive by comparison.
There is no separation of church and state.
Church is the state, state is the church.
The religion and the ideology is what runs everything.
Boys and girls separated from the time they're ten.
You can't see La Perla's brassiere ad.
That's wrong.
Oh, you can't see Posh Spice's shoulder.
You can't see the knee or the thigh.
- Can't I police my own thoughts?
- No.
That's the problem when a country's built entirely on marriage between church and state.
There isn't much room for moderates.
There's no freedom of speech or freedom of the press, speaking or writing anything critical of the royal family is illegal.
Public protest is actually forbidden.
The Ministry of Information monitors the Web for any immoral content, but websites supporting Al-Qaeda seem to get through just fine.
What do fundamentalists hope to achieve?
Power in the name of God.
That's where I don't like it.
They manipulate the Islamic teachings to fit different situations, different conditions,
- to, ultimately, lead them to power.
- Yeah.
I don't think a religious person, be it Christian, Jewish or Muslim, by his own upbringing and teaching, is qualified to be a public official.
He's just not.
Politics is completely different from religion.
I don't think any religious person is qualified to be a public official.
A good amount of secularism in every Arab political system is badly needed.
Drawing clear lines between where an Imam, a priest role, a responsibility ends, and a politician, or a public official's responsibility begins.
We need it for stability.
I'd love to hear your thoughts on Osama bin Laden.
Osama bin Laden, per se, is not the problem.
The school of thought, the followers, the teaching that he has planted in Islamic countries, in the Muslim world, is where the restructuring and the fight should begin.
It's unfortunate, but he is a product of the system, the establishment.
There's no denying that.
We have to accept that.
I went to a school to find what kids are being taught about the west.
These two young, open-minded, free-thinking students, picked by the administration, are the two I'm allowed to speak to.
Understanding that their teacher and principal be present the whole time.
How old are you guys?
Eighteen.
Eighteen, yeah.
So how is it being 18 in Saudi Arabia?
Great.
We have no worries or troubles.
What did you learn about the United States while you were in school?
Actually, we did not study the United States specifically.
What's your opinion of the United States?
I have no definite opinion...
no specific opinion.
I'm just curious what you think about the U.S.
In the United States we hear one idea about Muslim countries,
Saudi Arabia is where the hijackers came from.
Saudi Arabia is the country that makes a lot of money off of oil.
So I'm curious what you guys hear about the United States.
No answer.
You have no answer?
No?
How about you?
Their view is...
Americans always want to dominate...
No, that was the wrong answer...
One of the things we hear a lot in the United States, is that there's a lot of anti-Western, or anti-Semitic things taught in school.
What are you taught about Israel?
Stop your cameras.
- What's wrong?
I'm sorry?
- They want to stop.
- They want to stop the whole thing?
- Yes.
OK.
How are you to have a discussion, if he can't talk about things?
How are things supposed to change if you can't address them?
Excuse me, I was wondering if we could ask you a question?
Excuse me, I was wondering if you guys could help me?
No?
Could I ask you guys a question?
No?
Do you know anybody who could get me in touch with Osama bin Laden?
Osama bin Laden?
No, I have no leads.
It's becoming more obvious, Osama never went to the mall.
- So this is a good moisturizer?
- Yeah.
- It'll keep my hands really soft?
- Yeah.
- Where can I find Osama bin Laden?
- What?
- You saw him?
- Yes.
Do you know which aisle he was in?
Was he down past the Nutella?
Is he in Saudi Arabia?
- Maybe.
- Maybe.
OK.
Maybe you can ask his family.
Maybe they can help you.
- OK.
All right.
- Yeah.
- Cool, I'll do that.
Thanks.
Bye.
- OK.
Bye.
It's a great suggestion.
I'm going to talk to his family.
OK, this is the Bin Laden Aviation Agency.
How fitting, right?
That's terrible.
Look, I'm not lying.
Right there.
There's the Bin Laden Aviation Agency.
Where can I marry Osama bin Laden?
- Oh, you don't know?
- I don't.
Please make sure that you have the correct number.
Your call cannot be completed as dialed.
After 9/11, wouldn't you change your number if your last name was bin Laden?
That probably would have been the very first thing I would have done.
I would have been like, "God, Osama, you asshole.
Now I got to change all my phone numbers."
There's a window right there.
We would like to ask you some questions about Osama bin Laden.
Yeah.
We're looking for anything.
A phone number, any information we could get.
Anything anybody may know.
He's like, "Do you think he's here?"
I said, "He's not here?" He goes, "Maybe." Maybe!
- He's in the basement.
- Maybe he's in the basement.
I'm looking for Osama bin Laden.
Why is that funny?
Why is that funny?
What's wrong with that?
- Where is your car?
- Where is my car?
Why, you going to blow it up or something?
You want to see it?
We're going up to bin Laden's farm.
We're going to go to his place, this house that he built with his own hands.
We're going to talk to people in the village, see if somebody can get me in.
- That guy said this was it.
- Yeah.
- Not much of a farm.
Look at this.
- Yeah.
It's like a trailer park.
This must be the house.
Let's go.
Let's get out of here.
Man, I should have bought some sandals.
Well, I didn't find OBL, or any good clues in the desert of Saudi Arabia.
But that night I did find Othman Ya al Bari, who's related to one of the 9/11 hijackers.
Hopefully, he could point me in the right direction.
He's got professional wrestling on TV, he knows what's good, see?
One of your relatives was said to be one of the hijackers.
- Yes.
- Yeah.
Was he?
No.
After 9/11, there was video of a lot of the hijackers.
A lot of them released video statements.
Do you not think that connects them in some way to what happened?
I don't believe that is solid proof.
America wins all the Oscar awards.
It owns the best studios and technologies in the world.
We've seen the animals, the lion, the dog and the pig, we've seen them in many movies talking like humans.
I feel very uncomfortable with this conversation.
What do you think would drive some people towards wanting to join a group like Al-Qaeda?
What would make them want to go off and fight, possibly lose their lives?
They go because they feel like America... you feel like...
She's trying all kinds of ways to dominate and impose her dominance on the entire world, especially on the Muslim world.
Have you had friends who have gone off to wage jihad?
Yes, of course.
Where did they go?
These youth went first to Afghanistan.
Then America went into Iraq, and they followed.
How many people do you know that went?
- A lot.
- A lot.
And how many have come back?
Unfortunately, nobody came back.
Afghanistan is a country at war for more than 30 years, and it feels like it.
From when the Soviet Union invaded, to civil war, to the Taliban, and now the arrival of U.S. and NATO forces, its impact is everywhere.
Wherever you go there's barricades, barbed wire, people with guns, checkpoints, more people with guns.
And, in the middle of all this, is just this incredible poverty.
I thought the first place to look in Afghanistan for Osama was the last place that he was seen.
So we're heading out to Tora Bora.
They say, "No, no, it's not dangerous at all,"
yet there's 21 guys here with guns...
taking us to Tora Bora.
"No, it's fine.
You're not gonna need to worry about it at all."
Are there a lot of landmines in this area?
No, not on the path...
- Really?
- Really.
OK.
So, this area here, this was the beginning of Al-Qaeda's base?
This is where Osama's headquarters was.
There are large caves on this side and the other side too.
They were full of ammunition, weapons, and food such as tea, sugar and rice.
Look, up there, should we go?
One of our soldiers is shaking the nuts off the tree, 'cause, apparently...
if you eat 20 of these nuts...
All night long.
It's the word on the street.
You can rock and roll all night.
Look at that, we got a guy up in the tree to get the magic nuts.
Dude, look at that.
While these guys are playing with their nuts, I think I'll head out on my own.
President Bush said that he wanted to capture Osama bin Laden dead or alive.
The U.S. had its best chance in late November of 2001, when elements of both Afghan and American forces closed in on Osama's mountain hideout.
The following days saw some of the heaviest fighting in all of the war.
Yoo-hoo!
Osama!
And, rather than commit additional U.S. ground forces, the U.S. chose to rely on local Afghan fighters to bring in OBL.
When the dust had settled, Osama was gone.
The governor of the province has ideas how to bring the excitement back.
Our plan and goal is that Tora Bora should become an international tourism center.
So we want to build a grand amusement park in Tora Bora.
What kind of rides?
Everything will be built.
Maybe a roller coaster.
Everything will be built.
- Water slides?
- Absolutely.
- Ferris wheels?
All of it?
- Yes.
Yes.
You could say, "Tora Bora.
It's the bomb."
I'm not sure how much fun Afghanistan is ready for.
Seems to me they could use a lot more than just roller coasters around here.
No one has done anything for us.
All the international aid goes to those at the top.
It never makes its way down to us.
You got a tent from the UN.
No, we bought it in the black market!
No, we buy it in the black market.
They haven't helped us with land, money or to fix our tent or anything.
Look at this troublemaker!
When we're traveling at night, we have to constantly check the camel to make sure we didn't leave him somewhere.
Have you left him behind before?
Yeah, all the time!
We've lost them many times!
Our lives already passed.
We are concerned about our children.
They should be able to have a better life.
The international community is failing to help this country get on its feet.
Organizations such as USA gauge success by how much money they spend.
Not by what it achieves.
The bigger budget they have, the more impressed they are.
The fact that it doesn't achieve anything, all the clinics don't exist, no one seems to care back in the States, that information doesn't get there.
No one is helping this place, and if there is, no one is distributing it.
There are more than 800 houses here but no school or hospital.
We are living the same now as we were under the Taliban.
America must hold our government accountable.
America must ask why didn't you pave the streets with the money we gave you.
All those houses were destroyed by foreign countries.
Why don't they rebuild those houses?
They haven't done anything positive here.
Two years ago, the U.S. Ambassador came here and said,
"We're going to make a pledge to rebuild the school." It's been two years.
Look at this place.
This is hearts and minds.
It looks like a bomb went off yesterday.
There's bullet holes.
The front of the building is riddled with bullet holes.
Blast holes.
Nothing's being done.
We've got to do something for these kids.
We've gotta do something for these kids to say, "Somebody cares about us.
Somebody cares about us getting educated.
Somebody wants us to be in a safe environment."
As somebody about to become a father for the first time, it's so instilling in me, reminding me, of the things that I want for my family.
I don't ever want my child to be in a position where they can't be educated.
Or can't feel like they can better themselves, like that this is it.
That this is as good as it gets for their life, and to not have hope that tomorrow is going to be better.
Ow.
Ow.
Man, this baby starts kicking as soon as your phone rings.
- Baby knew I was calling.
- We miss you.
Baby knew.
Ow!
- Oh, I miss you so much.
- Yeah.
Me, too.
I dreamt we had a girl last night.
That's cute.
Ever see Osama bin Laden around here?
God know, if we catch him, we will tear him apart.
Osama bin Laden's Afghan's enemies.
Who is Osama?
He is the one who destroyed those buildings in America.
Fuck him.
And fuck America.
I'm looking for Osama bin Laden.
- Pakistan.
- Pakistan?
- Pakistan.
- OK!
Pakistan?
Pakistan.
It is very obvious to the world that he is hiding in Pakistan.
You should find him so we have peace in the world.
I'm looking for Osama bin Laden.
Tribal area.
Near Peshawar?
That is so cool.
I love you so much.
I love you too, baby.
That was my baby's little disco heartbeat.
What will happen if I go to Pakistan to look for him?
You will find him.
I will find him?
You want to come look for him with me?
No?
Why not?
I'll miss my family.
- I'm gonna miss my family.
- You'll miss your family.
I miss my family very much.
If I went into the tribal area, you think I'd be OK?
God knows what will happen if you go there.
Something terrible will happen to you.
You're finished.
The Taliban will cut your head.
- They'll cut my head?
Yeah.
- Yeah.
Ugh!
So Alex started getting contractions last night.
Braxton Hicks contractions, which aren't real contractions, but it's your body preparing for a contraction.
And, here I am, missing it all.
Missing it all, man, missing it all.
We just found out from U.S. military that we can go out on an embed.
And it's frightening.
But the most important thing, for me, is to try and, hopefully, just narrow down the path to finding the most wanted man on the planet.
How much they're actually looking for this guy, who knows?
But we'll find out.
This stuff is so heavy.
Everything in your body tells you you shouldn't be going to a job, or doing something where you gotta wear a bulletproof vest.
The next thing you'll see here in America you'll see terrorism.
If you don't think you'll see, you're blinding yourself to the historic development of everything taking place on this earth.
Terrorism.
Terrorism.
First of all, I'd like to welcome all of you guys to Firebase Apache.
- What questions do you have?
- Will we be able to speak to any of the people in the area who actually live in the local villages?
Um, when you go out to 4-2, yeah.
- There's a village right next to them.
- OK.
And that village also happens to be full of Taliban.
I'd like to remind you, while talking about going outside the wire.
When whoever we're with, whoever's escorting us says, "Let's go,"
get in the vehicle and go.
It doesn't mean finish your question.
It means go now.
This is hardcore Taliban country, let me tell you.
Over those mountains, that's Afghanistan.
If you go over those mountains, that's Pakistan.
We're centrally located with a lot of activity around us.
Will we stop in a village tomorrow?
- Yes, we will.
- What's the plan for the afternoon?
We're fogbound, we'll test fire weapons, talk, whatever you want.
You've got free rein.
I had a lot of grouping right beside the guy.
Well, if nothing else, it scared the hell out of him.
Can I try a rocket launcher?
That was awesome.
You've been here six months.
You might be able to tell me.
Where is Osama bin Laden?
We ask that every time we go out.
"Hey?
You guys know where Osama's at?" They always point up to the mountains.
Where's Osama?
- Where's Osama bin Laden?
- I have no clue.
Is he alive?
Even if he was, I don't think we'd know.
We are going to stop and speak to villagers.
They said I should write my blood type on anything that'd be attached to me.
Scary as shit, man.
What we're concentrating on is your security.
That's it.
In a firefight I'm going to come in.
Come to this effect, bring you in and we'll grab you to here.
As soon as I do, I'm going to try to grab you again.
As soon as it's safe, then we're going to move out.
When we go out, we expect to have contact.
We expect to get shot at.
Anything goes out there.
We always got to be ready for everything.
This is what we call a "friendly village."
Once they understand it's their choice to talk, the forces will stand back.
And then whoever wants to talk to you will talk to you.
Morgan, come up, let's introduce you.
Yes, sir.
This person is a civilian from America and wants to ask you some questions.
His name is Morgan.
I was hoping you could tell me your thoughts on the Taliban and the current conflict happening.
What do you think, who is happy with battles?
No one is happy with battles.
We are not happy.
We don't like the war.
We want a peaceful life.
We are neither your friends nor the Taliban's.
We just want a simple life.
What are things, when you look at your village, you need the most?
In terms of assistance.
The most important problem is the lack of water.
Before the base drilled their well we didn't have any water problems.
- What do you think of Osama bin Laden?
- Morgan!
Let's go now!
Now!
- Come on!
- Let's go now!
Be advised, I've just been informed of an ambush, possibly the governor's convoy.
And we are in pursuit of two individuals on foot.
Jedi-1, we're at 2-0-6.
That village to our left is where the Taliban went to.
We have one downed Taliban.
We have their motorcycle in our possession.
Over.
People have said Afghanistan is a winnable war.
What are your thoughts?
In counter-insurgency, killing doesn't work.
Got to work on the center of gravity, the people.
They like having clean water, having a medical clinic.
They like seeing their kids go to school.
It just makes it more difficult for the Taliban to change the tide and get the people to go to the other side.
Thank you and please tell your commander the father of Taza Gui says peace.
What would have happened if we had sent more troops here in 2002?
You would have killed more Taliban, but, I mean, we're killing a lot of Taliban right now.
And they've got the open sieve from the madrassas of Pakistan in the refugee camps that go to these young kids who don't have a job, who have no positive outlook in life.
They sell them with a lot of propaganda.
Tell them they're going to give their family money, bring them here.
- Where is Osama?
- I think he's in Pakistan.
I think it's quite likely that Osama bin Laden is in Pakistan.
The latest intelligence has always seemed to indicate that he is in Pakistan.
He's probably somewhere along that border region.
- Pakistan.
- Along that border.
Tribal areas of Pakistan.
Senior leadership, number one and two are there.
On the Pakistan border it's particularly dangerous, a region where terror rules.
And where many believe Osama bin Laden could be hiding.
Everyone I've spoken to said this is where Osama's hiding out.
Everyone, that is, except for Pakistanis.
- Where is Osama?
- You tell me.
- Where is Osama?
- I'm looking for him.
You tell me.
He's in Afghanistan.
Osama bin Laden is here.
Afghanistan.
Osama bin Laden...
Which animal is that?
I don't where he is, but it's also a question if he's alive or dead.
But, um, his influence is here.
He is a great soldier of the Muslims.
He is fighting for righteousness.
He's a diamond.
Osama is exploiting the root causes.
If we find the root causes, we'll solve everything.
- Osama bin Laden is nothing, sir.
- He is only one!
One person!
Dude, look at that.
Even in Pakistan they love wrestling.
- All the people like the wrestling.
- Tell me why you like wrestling.
- Because wrestling is fair.
- Can I let you in on a little secret?
- It's fixed.
- Fixed?
- Fixed.
It's not real.
- Maybe.
- You are right.
I know.
You are right.
- OK.
Good.
But when it is for a belt, then it is not fixed.
I'm looking, uh...
How are you?
How are you?
Hi.
I'm just looking...
Just based on what everybody has said, I got to think we're within a couple hundred miles of where he is.
Maybe even less.
Yeah, OK.
OK.
Thank you.
Tomorrow we're heading into this area of the tribal regions, just past Peshawar, where everyone has told me Osama bin Laden is.
I mean, I have no idea what to expect when I get there.
I've been traveling for months to try and find this person that everybody we talk to...
You know, they all say,
"Why are you looking for this person?
What is he?
He's one man?"
The thing that I've realized is that this whole trip is a chance to actually go out and see and talk to those people that we're told to be so scared of all the time.
I'm not somebody who thinks we can sit around the campfire and sing Kumbaya, you know?
That's ridiculous.
But I believe that we create these demons within ourselves.
And we create these demons within the media.
And we create these visions that are so beyond reality.
They start feeding themselves after a while.
Our fear just becomes exponential.
They say when you go looking for trouble, you'll find it.
It's not that I'm looking for trouble.
I'm just looking for answers.
And I think I've found a lot.
I think I've found a lot on this trip.
"Attention.
Entry of foreigners is prohibited beyond this point."
Even if I go over the border to find Osama, it's not going to, suddenly, make the world safer for my kid.
The things that are pushing people to follow him and his ideas are still going to be there.
And that's what we have to change.
I think that we need to take a step back and really ask ourselves, "What kind of a world do we want to live in?
What do we want that world to be?"
It's not worth it.
So her water just broke, which is very exciting.
So, I'm that much closer.
- OK.
- OK?
You want to get up?
It's your son!
- It's a boy!
- We have a baby boy!
- We have a baby boy.
- Oh, my God!
He's beautiful.
So, I didn't end up finding Osama.
What I did find, is that there are a lot more people out there who are just like us, than there are who are just like him.
I'll always bet on the billions of regular people to win over the crazies.
After all, we all want the same things for our families.
We want the world to be a place where we can raise and love our kids.
Where they can have everything they need to be happy, healthy, without it blowing up around them.
It's not going to be easy.
And all that reward money sure would have helped but, hey, you know what?
He's going to love public school.
[man] You ever wake up in the morning and think,
"Man, life is good.
I mean, it just can't get any better than this. "
It's all beautiful and perfect and wonderful and amazing, and then, one day, that one thing happens that changes everything.
[bomb whistling]
- I'm pregnant.
- [man] That's only one test.
[man sighs] Oh, boy.
[Morgan] What kind of a world am I bringing a kid into?
They say the most important job a father has is to keep his baby safe.
But how am I going to do that?
I can cover the electrical sockets, or childproof Mommy's pill bottles, but that's just inside the house.
- What about out there?
- [sirens wailing]
There's cults, muggers, drugs, violence.
Not to mention all of the predators now lurking about.
I could move from the East Village to a family friendly neighborhood in Brooklyn, but is that enough to keep my child safe?
- And what about the big things?
- [thunder rumbles]
Things like hurricanes, earthquakes or tsunamis?
And that's just that mean, old, Mother Nature.
What about the really big things?
Things we should really be afraid of.
Like the most wanted man on the planet.
What about him?
We've got the strongest military, sneakiest spies and coolest technology in the entire world, but we can't find one man hiding in
Afghanibaluchapakiwaziristan?
[ MC Hammer:
U Can't Touch This]
[man] After 9/1 1, I thought some satellite would shoot a laser down onto the earth, fry up an omelet bin Laden and save us all.
But that wasn't the case.
I know, maybe he's dead.
But maybe he's alive.
Maybe he's on dialysis.
Maybe he's a nine foot bionic ninja with X-ray vision and the power of flight.
All I know is that in the last six years, there've been more acts of terrorism, worldwide, than in 20 years leading up to it.
Today, there are known terrorist cells in more than 100 countries around the world.
By the time my kid's out of diapers, everyone's gonna be a terrorist.
Nowhere's gonna be safe.
With Operation Special Delivery only 1 9 weeks away,
I just can't sit around and do nothing.
If the CIA and the FBI can't find him, and I'm going to make this world safe for my child, it's time for a new plan.
If I've learned anything from big budget action movies, it's that complicated global problems are best solved by one lonely guy crazy enough to think he can fix everything before the credits roll.
And I'm going to find out once and for all:
Where in the world is Osama bin Laden?
[ Jon Spurney:
Where in the World is Osama bin Laden?
]
[all hollering]
[hooting]
Moustache ride.
Reign of Terror!
I'm gonna get you, Osama been hiding.
[Morgan] I wanted to talk to you because I'm getting ready to do a lot of travel.
I wanted to see if I'm going to need any shots, anything...
Where are you going to be going?
We're going to go look for Osama bin Laden.
OK. [laughs] You'll probably find him.
Um, you're going to need a whole bunch of shots and prescriptions.
- You want to do it, want to go for it?
- I'm going to need it all, right?
- How many shots am I getting?
- Diphtheria, tetanus, polio.
Typhoid, meningitis, hepatitis A and B.
This one I must tell you about.
This is your yellow fever.
About one in one million people who get the yellow fever shot, get a very, very bad reaction.
They get multi-system organ failure.
There are six reported cases or more, maybe seven or eight.
And about four of them died.
[Morgan] Going to need more than shots to keep me safe in the places I'm heading to.
[man] This is reality-based personal protection, teaching you how to survive explosions, small arms attacks, sniper attacks, chemical attacks.
We cover it all.
We're going to simulate a hand grenade attack.
Boom!
You would have been killed.
I'll show you how to survive.
The first thing you want to do is turn away from the grenade and dive.
You're in a perfect position.
This is going to save your life by 98 percent.
When someone's head explodes, that's what it looks like.
Even though it's tragic, we can't focus on this, we got to think about survival.
Look at the wall there.
What do you see?
- [Morgan] I see blood.
- [Wagner] OK, good.
We have the "blood splatter."
How do we determine where the sniper is at, based on our situation here?
Hold up a hat on a stick.
If I'm in a restaurant, I don't want to sit in the middle.
If a gunman came, where is he most likely to hit?
You're dead here.
This is what we call the "fatal funnel."
You want to stay behind that line, you want to stay off the wall.
You're dead here.
You're dead here.
Any time you leave your vehicle, you gotta assume, in dangerous places, someone could plant a bomb on your vehicle.
You're dead here.
- [both laughing]
- You're dead here.
Here's what I recommend, you go around the corner, and then you can pull it open, and if it doesn't go boom, you can go check it out.
Gonna be the most paranoid person in the Middle East.
Maybe that's a good thing.
Because if I'm going to find Osama,
I'm traveling to scary places.
In the last year, the State Department issued over 100 warnings about traveling to the Middle East.
Mainly because Americans are now bigger targets for kidnapping and murder.
[Wagner] Now we're going to have a little classroom time about kidnapping.
Here are some basics of surviving as a hostage.
You got to accept it and start planning on how you're going to survive it.
Speak only if spoken to.
- Is this the crew's, the cameraman's?
- No.
[Wagner] Don't provoke the captors.
Don't stare at them.
Don't have a harsh tone of voice.
Don't be argumentative.
Don't have an attitude.
These people are in control, not you.
[man] This is not a fucking game.
[Wagner] Especially when you're in Baghdad, Kabul, or you're in Turkey, this stuff is going on daily, and you gotta be prepared for it.
I'm usually a pretty calm person when it comes to crazy shit happening around me.
But that's a whole other level of crazy.
[guitar riffs play]
We wage a war to save a civilization itself.
[guitar riffs play]
They hate us, our country.
They hate the liberties for which we stand.
[guitar riffs play]
Until you catch the chicken, you don't have the chicken.
- Go, go, go!
- [ Jon Spurney:
No Pain, No Gain]
Want you to get used to the sound of the language.
- [both making consonant sounds]
- Oh, good, Wow.
Go for the eyes.
The eyes!
Are you going to convert to Muslim or not?
Shoot him, shoot him.
I recommend you wear the clothes.
Maybe you can hit the tanning salon a little bit.
- [shots firing] - [yelling]
- Grenade!
- [screaming]
Somebody said I should grow my beard out?
Yeah, for you.
Because you obviously look very foreign.
- Look at this area.
Much bigger, right?
- This guy is probably alive.
[speaking foreign language]
You could have a situation where a device explodes and it gets on you.
Oh, fuck!
I brought you these outfits.
Hopefully, it keeps you safe.
This is a normal reaction.
He's fine.
How do I say, "Don't take me, take the cameraman?"
He's alive!
You have to know the way an Islamic terrorist thinks.
[Morgan] Jim's right.
I need to learn how Osama thinks.
To find a fox, you need to think like a fox.
I need to get inside his head and learn what makes him tick.
I need to explore the world he comes from.
Meet the people who influenced him.
Visit the places that shaped him into who he is today.
And, most of all, I need to try to understand what drives an Osama bin Laden to begin with.
I know just the place to start.
[beeping]
[ Malik Audouane:
Theme from Shaft]
Egypt is the birthplace of one of the heaviest hitters in the world of terrorism.
Ayman Al-Zawahiri.
He's Al-Qaeda's Team Manager and Osama's personal mentor.
His stats are pretty impressive.
He was a member of the Muslim Brotherhood at the age of 14.
He's a life-long follower of Sayyid Qutb, the man credited with creating modern day Islamic fundamentalism, is currently the number two of Al-Qaeda, and he's a Gemini.
And I got a tip where to find his uncle, Mahfouz Azzam.
If he can tell me where the A-man is, odds are Osama won't be too far away.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Mahfouz?
[speaks Arabic]
- It's nice to see you.
Welcome.
- Nice to see you.
- Thank you.
- Please.
- It's a beautiful day today.
Very nice.
- Yeah.
- [Morgan] So do you know where he is?
- [man in Arabic] No.
Where do you think he is?
[in Arabic] If you learn where he is, I beg you, let me know.
I just want to make sure he is OK.
He won't let me know by phone because you kill people with the phone.
The Russians killed the president of Chechnya with the phone, and you Americans have killed people with the phone.
This, a telephone, has become a lethal weapon!
And every month my bank account gets killed by my phone.
- [laughing]
- Which makes it even worse.
So, if you knew where he was, you wouldn't turn him in for the $25,000,000?
[laughs]
I would like to tell you something, the hungry who cannot find bread to eat in Afghanistan they wouldn't accept these $25 million of yours to turn in a Muslim they know is waging jihad for them.
So he's in Afghanistan?
- You say so.
- You said so.
You just told me.
America says so.
America says so.
- Do you think he's in Afghanistan?
- America says.
So if Al-Zawahiri and Osama bin Laden just disappeared tomorrow, would things change?
The seed that was sown by America, a seed of spitefulness, hate, aggression and killing, cannot disappear in the short term.
There has to be another foreign policy to uproot this seed.
[Morgan] It's easy to criticize American foreign policy, with the second most wanted terrorist in the family.
I should find regular folks who might be more objective.
What do you guys hear about Americans?
[in Arabic] The Americans are known to be fighting the Egyptians, Palestinians and Iraqis.
- We're fighting you?
- [laughing]
- Yes.
- Really?
I didn't even know that.
What are we fighting the Egyptians for?
[speaking Arabic]
You want to occupy Egypt.
[Morgan] Do we?
Why?
We're not that well versed in politics but that's what we hear on TV and stuff.
What do you think about America?
[in Arabic] They are good people, but we reject the American foreign policy.
[Morgan] How can he be against American foreign policy?
Egypt is one of our best friends in the region and in the global war on terror.
At the same time, it was home to five of the founding fathers of Al-Qaeda.
The guy who tried to blow up the World Trade Center in '93, and the ringleader of the 9/1 1 hijackings.
Maybe university students could tell me why Osama's making so many friends here.
It's about oppression, because Egypt is a developing country, so, like, the people who are oppressed are kind of more...
So it develops more terrorists, and that's it.
[in Arabic] These would be the minority, the rotten type.
Every society has the same.
Every society has good and bad.
In Egypt, people have no freedom.
And they try and prove to the government that they have freedom, deserve freedom, by committing terrorist attacks.
Did you vote in the last presidential election?
- No.
- No.
- You weren't old enough yet?
- It's not that.
I don't believe in it.
I know it's rigged.
I know that Hosni Mubarak would have won anyway.
They call this a democratic country, but it's not.
In Egypt, if a president wants to stay in power, he'll stay in power.
[applause]
[Morgan] And Hosni Mubarak has been in power for more than 26 years.
The United States has got a close and meaningful relationship with Egypt.
[cheering]
This relationship is a cornerstone for our policy in the Middle East.
[Morgan] Policy that includes giving Mubarak an aid package, while looking the other way as he uses riot police and hired thugs armed with sticks, knives, swords and Molotov cocktails to keep the opposition from voting on election day.
You might say about Mubarak the same thing FDR said about another dictator.
He may be a son of a bitch, but he's our son of a bitch.
[Morgan] See, we've had a policy of propping up dictators for more than 50 years now.
When the Cold War started heating up, we decided to do what it took to stop communism from taking over.
And the United States started mixing with a rougher crowd.
Hmm!
In 1 953, the CIA helped the Shah of Iran overthrow the Iranian government, to become their supreme ruler.
Sure, the Shah tortured or killed anyone who publicly disagreed with him.
Even went as far as shoving broken glass up the nether regions of critics.
But he totally hated Communism.
Now, he was a son of a bitch, but he was our son of a bitch.
The Shah kept Iran in our corner until 1 979, when Ayatollah Khomeini's Islamic revolution swept to power, and held 52 Americans hostage for 15 months.
That's when we made friends with Saddam Hussein over in Iraq.
Now, he was an SOB too, but for ten years, while he was fighting the Iranians, he was our SOB.
In fact, by the mid-'80s, we had sons of bitches all the way from Latin America to the Middle East, but, hey, pimping freedom ain't easy.
[hip-hop music plays]
[Morgan] We needed to keep our SOBs happy and on our side.
So we provided them with tanks, guns, planes and more money.
Today we give Egypt more than 2 billion dollars a year in weapons and aid.
Sure, there's torture, murder and rampant political corruption, but somewhere along the way we decided that, in order to protect our own freedom, it was all right to sacrifice the freedom of others.
Does lack of democracy, human rights, in countries like Egypt encourage people to get involved in extremist radical groups?
Of course.
There's no doubt about this.
It's the one thing that I agree with George W. Bush about.
That people join terrorist organizations because there is no other way to be active.
The threat of terrorism created the climate of fear that is being exploited by the Mubarak regime and by George Bush.
We're going through a very difficult time now.
I mean, we have terrorists on one side, and opportunist, exploitative regimes on the other side.
The U.S. can no longer claim the moral ground.
People have learned to expect a lot less from the U.S. than they used to.
[Arabic music plays]
[man in Arabic] The United States is the main problem in the region, frankly.
We love the American people, but we hate the American government.
[in Arabic] We pray to God to destroy you because of what's happening.
[Morgan] America's filled with people who want people to live peacefully, to co-exist together, just like me.
OK, I don't want you to be there when it happens.
Have a smell.
[Morgan] You know, being in the States, all we get on the news are the crazy nuts that like to scream, "Death to you!"
And so you're like, "Oh, man.
Go get them."
But we've been in Egypt for a week now, talking to people, who are real people, just like you and me.
One after another after another everybody said,
"This government's corrupt and it's backed by the U. S. "
- [chanting]
- It's hard for me to see how damaged the image of the country that I love and care about has become.
[phone rings]
- [Morgan] Hello?
- I got your postcard from Egypt today.
Oh, nice.
You sound good.
I am good.
Just promise you'll be here when it's really important.
OK?
I promise.
[woman] He has to be back by the first week of November, because I'm due the end of November, early December.
And, if he misses that, I'm going to be so upset.
And he's going to be upset.
But, also, he's going to these places that are so dangerous.
And I don't want him to miss anything.
And I don't want him to get hurt.
[man singing in Arabic] [man in Arabic] While we are living in these troubled times, we need to be merciful.
So get mercy through praises and prayers upon Him because He is mercy.
And He puts compassion in your heart.
As a Muslim I am taught that God has honored humankind.
He did not say he honored Muslims and everyone else is a second class citizen.
[speaking Arabic] We have honored the children of heaven.
[singing in Arabic]
[man] Your average Egyptian's struggling like your average American to make ends meet, to get a decent job, provide for his family, educate his kids.
The same concerns all over.
[Morgan] Torek is an Egyptian-American studying law at Al Azhar University.
He's a new dad and wants the world's view of Islam to change for the sake of his young son.
[Torek] We need to rectify this,
Muslims are over one fifth of the world population.
That's a lot of people.
It's not some Polynesian island somewhere.
- [Morgan laughs]
- That's a lot of people!
If four-fifths of the world are scared of one-fifth, what kind of civilization and humanity are we gonna have?
- [laughing] - [speaking Arabic]
Now they're going to think all we do is pray.
- Even the kids!
- I'm working on the voice-over.
From a very young age, they start manipulating the children.
[laughing]
[Torek] We need to differentiate between extreme factions in a population, and the regular, vast majority of people.
What do you think of the War on Terror?
It's a bogus term.
I don't think it means anything.
I think some guy that had too much to drink in the Pentagon, one night, came up with that.
- Dude, I got a great idea.
- A war on terrorism.
We had a war on drugs.
We didn't win that, either.
[Torek] But is it really a war on terror?
Have we eradicated terror?
Or are we exporting terror?
I think that...
Unfortunately, I think that we're exporting it.
I think that we lit the flame on a bomb.
[Morgan] The bomb Torek is speaking of is the explosive rise in terrorist attacks during the last seven years.
Al-Qaeda has now become a global franchise, serving up an unhealthy dose of j ihad to more and more people each year.
Ooh!
Can I help you?
[Morgan] Despite the U. S. spending over $500 billion fighting the war on terror,
Al-Qaeda continues to find new markets to expand into.
Thanks to heavy worldwide recruitment, which included having interested people filling out job applications, AQ is now back to its pre-9/1 1 strength.
Two of the U. S. 's closest allies, Spain and England, were both attacked by homegrown Al-Qaeda cells.
Even Muslim countries are finding they are in Al-Qaeda's crosshairs, often becoming the victims of terrorism and feeling the influence of Osama bin Laden firsthand.
[Arabic music plays]
[Morgan] Where is Osama bin Laden?
[in Arabic] He might be somewhere here in Morocco.
[in Arabic] How should I know?
- Bin Laden?
I am not a politic man.
- Yeah.
I don't know nothing about...
I'm a carpet dealer.
I sell carpet.
[Morgan] How many years has this tannery been here?
[in Arabic] Centuries.
What do you think about people who cause violence in the name of Islam?
[in Arabic] It is not from Islam to kill innocent people or to blow yourself up.
I'm disgusted by that.
[Morgan] Do you ever worry that your sons may get involved with terrorists?
We worry about that.
We don't want them to get involved with that kind of crowd.
That's why we have to take care of them financially.
[man in Arabic] Americans are causing all the trouble in the world.
But...
Were the...
But this is my opinion of the American government, not the American people.
[in Arabic] These are all the problems that Bush created.
I heard that they want to eradicate Islam.
[Morgan] What do you think about Osama bin Laden?
[speaking Arabic]
[Morgan laughs] He's crazy?
[in Arabic] Osama bin Laden, look how many people he's killed, how many have died.
And what has he accomplished?
He's accomplished a wave of suicide bombings in Morocco killing more than 50 people over the last four years.
The first attack was in May of 2003, when recruiters outside the country came to town and convinced 14 young men to blow themselves up in exchange for money and the rewards of paradise.
They all grew up on the exact same street in the desperately poor ghetto of Sidi Moumen.
I met journalist Aboubakr Jamai, to find out what'd drive young men to cause such destruction.
[Jamai] I think it's a mix of ingredients.
And, depending on the situation, one of the ingredients is more important than the others.
And, these ingredients, I think in the case of Morocco, the socio-economic ingredient is the most important one.
It's not a coincidence that all of the guys who blew themselves up in the 1 6th of May, uh, 2003, came from this shantytown.
They were either unemployed or had menial jobs.
And they were completely outcast in their own society.
[Morgan] What do you think is the solution?
[Jamai] The problem in Morocco, with the people here, is that we fail to give them an economic voice and a political voice.
To me, that's the solution.
Need to give opportunity, economically speaking, because extremism nourishes itself from darkness.
[ Ernest Ranglin and Baaba Maal:
Haayo]
[Morgan] That evening I was invited to dinner with Ahmed and his family, in the same 200 square-foot house he grew up in.
Ahmed doesn't want his children to fall prey to the same people the bombers did.
But with a poor education system and little money, he fears they could be exploited.
Thank you for letting us come here.
This is a great thing.
[in Arabic] Islam obligates us to be this way, to be brothers with everyone.
[Morgan] I'm about to have a baby in December.
Give me some fatherly advice.
You should take care of your wife.
I've got a good wife, so that's good.
If your relationship is based on love and good values, you will have good children.
[Morgan] Wow.
What kind of fish is that?
It's like a sardine.
It's delicious.
I'm glad.
Eat with good health.
So, I want you to tell me, what do you hope for your kids?
I want my kids to get an education.
The people who aren't educated won't accomplish anything in their life.
How did you do in school?
- [laughter]
- She's laughing!
She teases me.
Sometimes she and the kids gang up on me.
So do I have that to look forward to?
When you have your child they will do the same to you.
How hard is it to get a good education living in this area?
You can't get well educated living here, because of the poverty.
I'd like to hear your opinion.
When we hear about all these people who... what are your thoughts on those people?
Those people do not belong to Islam.
Even the terrorism that happened here was masterminded abroad.
The people who blew themselves up were tempted, some tempted by money and some by Paradise.
It is much harder for this generation than it was for my generation.
[woman in French] Violence is birthed by the economic dead ends that confront our youth who happen to be Muslim with an Islamic outlook.
How do you feel that we, as Americans, or how do we as a world culture start to end the fighting?
I believe that there is an enormous anger with American policy.
It's too bad it's the American people who have to pay for that anger.
And so we have the obligation not to fail our future, we have to reach out to each other, ignore official political lines and create unofficial bridges between civilian societies in order to bring about change.
What were your thoughts after 9/1 1 happened?
If it were truly Osama bin Laden, who did that, then he dealt us a bad hand.
He legitimized the American presence in the Middle East.
He was the reason for the adoption of all the anti-terrorist laws that have pushed us further under the yoke of our own local political leaders.
I was astonished on many levels.
It's horrible.
[beeping] [beeping]
[Morgan] Osama bin Laden says one reason for the creation of Al-Qaeda and attacks against the West, is the existence of Israel,
America's support of her and the treatment of the Palestinian people.
If Osama cares about the Palestinians so much,
I wanted to see if the feeling was mutual.
If it is,
I'm sure someone can help me narrow in on it.
[Morgan] How do you feel about Al-Qaeda causing acts of terrorism
- in the name of the Palestinian people?
- I don't agree with Al-Qaeda.
Yeah.
I'll leave that alone.
I don't agree with them at all.
It is none of their business to do anything for us.
We can do for ourselves.
We are fighting to make our homeland free.
It's none of their business.
[Morgan] I was wondering if you could help?
Looking for Osama bin Laden.
- [man] Go to Tora Bora.
No.
- Not here in Ramallah?
- No?
- They hate Osama bin Laden.
- Palestinians?
- Palestinians.
- And you know, if...
- Why do they hate him?
Because he likes blood.
You know?
He is a ridiculous Muslim.
He gives a bad picture about Islam.
[Arabic hip-hop plays]
We've heard Hamas is on the same level as Al-Qaeda.
Is that true?
[in Arabic] Ours is not a religious conflict.
We don't fight the Jews because they are Jews.
No, we fight them because they occupy our lands.
And Al-Qaeda, it holds all of the West as an enemy.
But the number one reason they say they do it is because of the Palestinian conflict.
Because of what's happening here.
Any Arab leader, all Arab movements have adopted the Palestinian issue because they know the Palestinian issue is what triggers the emotions and nationalistic feelings in all Arab and Muslim people.
But, at the same point, they're using you guys as, like, this battle cry, but they're doing nothing to help you.
That's the reality.
Without the Palestinian issue, they won't get any attention on the global level.
It is strategic on their part to adopt the Palestinian issue.
[Morgan] Unbelievable how many walls are here, the separation.
Everywhere you go there's a wall, a fence, barbed wire.
It's not for a human being.
It's good for a zoo.
[in Arabic] If this was happening in Israel,
America and all the other countries would protest it.
- The peace of life, we don't have it.
- Yeah.
And we are living in very big prison.
[in Arabic] I wish we had somebody like Osama bin Laden in Palestine.
Just to destroy the state of Israel.
It's a political struggle, a military struggle.
But the biggest thing is this.
All of this is about land.
Scattered through the hills of the Palestinian West Bank, are Israeli settlements, built to expand the Jewish presence in the region.
How does it feel, being overlooked by settlements?
It's not only overlooking us, but we are always under their foot.
[in Arabic] They can come and take over my home, where I live, by force.
What can I do?
I can't do anything.
[man] Tears and blood were shed today as Israel began the forced evacuation of Jewish settlers from their homes.
[Morgan] The settlements are a cause of violence between settlers and Palestinians, they are also a contentious issue within Israeli politics.
With one side seeing the settlements as another obstacle in achieving peace, while the other sees it as a divine right.
We Jews are the rightful owner of this land.
- Mm-hmm.
- It was a land that was promised to them by the Almighty, who kept his promise and brought us back.
After we realized there's going to be a struggle about every centimeter of the land, we realized we have to settle on the outposts to enlarge the area.
This outpost, for instance, it's...
- So is that legal to do that?
- It's illegal in the moment, as it is in the process of being legalized.
[Morgan] What is your thought on the Palestinian conflict?
When we were kids, there was this game where you play music
- and there's a circle of chairs.
- Yeah.
Musical chairs.
Musical chairs.
This is a bit like a musical chair tragedy.
Somebody is left without a chair.
But everybody needs to sit somewhere.
[Morgan] Should Israelis move out of the settlements?
israel'll have to let go of the territories.
We are not holding the territories, the territories are holding us.
The tragedy of this place is that everybody knows exactly what would be the solution in the end, the end of the story.
Two countries that are connected, but separated.
And this is the way it's going to end.
Every person in his right mind knows this is the way it's going to end.
One thing we don't know is how many people are going to die, and how much time is going to pass.
But the end is very clear.
- Yeah.
- That's tragic.
Are there politicians working towards a solution?
Yes, there are politicians who are working for peace.
The problem is, if you have three buses exploding in Tel Aviv,
- it will stop.
- Yeah.
And we can progress the peace process once again, and then if a settler in the territories will kill somebody, it will stop again.
And so, we're being held hostage by the extremists from both sides.
So this is basically Israel, and that's the Gaza Strip.
And...
It's pretty...
It's pretty scary.
It is really scary.
Imagine that rolling up over your hill, coming at your house.
Imagine living like this.
Imagine this is how you live every single day.
[explosion]
Oh, shit.
[woman] A Qassam touched down next to a daycare center in Sderot this morning.
No one was wounded in the attack, but the Hamas chief warned the rocket attacks on Israel will continue.
[Morgan] So this classroom was blown up about eight and a half hours ago.
Luckily, there were no kids in it.
Rocket came from the Gaza Strip.
If there had been kids in here, half of them would be dead.
You see this and get a sense of how wrong things are.
I can't imagine raising my kid up in a place like this.
I couldn't imagine living in a place where my kid went to school, and this is something that can happen every day.
[woman] I think everything's going pretty good with the pregnancy.
Thirty weeks, it's very active, and it's positioned the right way, and everything's good.
Take deep, full breaths into the belly.
I never imagined I would spend my pregnancy like this, separated from my partner, but, then again, before Morgan, I never thought I would have kids, so... [laughs]
You just never can tell, can you?
[siren wails]
Here with the Israeli Police Bomb Squad, they got a call.
Two calls, actually.
Going to check them out.
[siren wails]
- Is it right here?
- Yeah.
Right, few feet of us.
Let's go!
[in Hebrew] The suspicious object is here, past the garbage can.
[man in Hebrew] Listen up.
Good evening to everyone.
There is a suspicious object there.
I am asking everyone who is in this area of Allenby and the area of the boardwalk to move away from the area.
The man on the hotel balcony, get inside.
Everyone is requested to be behind the police gates.
Pay attention.
This is the bomb squad.
I am about to conduct a controlled explosion on the suspicious object.
[Morgan] It's so scary.
And this happens every day.
Eight to ten times a day, he said, sometimes up to 1 8.
Don't stand near the windows.
[man] Three... two... one.
Go.
There's a bikini inside.
[laughs] Check it out.
Well, my heart's pounding and it's a bikini. [laughs]
Nice job, pal.
You did good.
- [beeps]
- Good job, buddy.
No, come on.
Don't be so hard on yourself.
- [beeping]
- There'll be plenty more chances.
- [Morgan] Can we ask you questions?
- [man] About what?
- About....
- Political?
- A little bit. [laughs]
- No, no.
I'd love to hear your thoughts on the current conflict.
It's all an illusion?
Yes.
Wow.
That guy is one of the greatest optimists I've ever seen.
How you doing?
Can I ask you a couple of questions?
[splashing]
So somebody just threw a water balloon at us.
[man in Hebrew] Get the hell out of here!
And now there's a crowd gathering because they're going to chase us away.
They're gathering numbers now.
There's a big flock of people that's going to chase us.
- Go off!
- [man in Hebrew] Get out of here!
This is not your land.
I'm not allowed to talk to anybody in the country?
[man in Hebrew] Get the hell out of here!
- I'd say...
- Get out of here!
...we're not very wanted around here.
[in Hebrew] I'm going to break this.
This place is no joke.
We were down there just trying to talk to people.
So what you see here, majority of people here don't think like them.
Yeah, I think we've found enough peace here today.
Out of here, get out of here, get out of here!
It is...
It's no joke.
Go off!
Go off!
- I'm going to my car.
- Go off!
Dude.
- Yeah.
- Jewish?
I'm going to my car.
- No Jewish.
- [shouting]
There's so many things that are wrong on both sides.
If this was solved tomorrow, if, suddenly, there were two states, and people were living in peace, would bin Laden go away?
I don't think it would happen.
What you're doing, is you're taking an argument away.
It isn't.
It's messed up.
[shouting]
There goes my friend.
See you.
[Morgan] How hard is it for you to be in the minority in this region, a Christian in a Muslim country?
I have no problem whatsoever, living with the Muslims.
We are worshipping Allah.
And, uh, I am worshipping the same God, that the Christians and the Muslims and the Jews are worshipping.
The one God.
Religion is being used as a mask to hide the cruelty the ugliness of violence.
Moderates, they are the majority, but their voices are not loud enough.
[Morgan] What are your thoughts on the global war on terror?
9/1 1 breaks the hearts of every human being, but I think the best way is not to fight only.
You have to look for the root of the problem.
What our American brothers and friends need is a cultural strategy.
Without understanding each other, without this mutual respect, there's no peace.
It's impossible.
Mission is impossible.
[Morgan] Not only is it impossible, it's downright scary.
Just ask journalist Fouad Hussein.
Ten years ago while he was jailed for criticizing Jordan's economic policies, he met Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, leader of Al-Qaeda in Iraq.
They remained pen pals up until Zarqawi was killed in 2006.
According to what Zarqawi told him,
America is playing right into Al-Qaeda's hands.
[in Arabic] Al-Qaeda attacked New York and Washington on September 1 1th.
Because Al-Qaeda can't fight the U.S. on its soil, they drew them to Arabic land so that they will fight them here.
[Morgan] Had we left Afghanistan and said "That's it."
You know, "We're done." What would have happened?
After Afghanistan, Al-Qaeda didn't have anywhere to operate.
If the United States hadn't entered Iraq,
Al-Qaeda wouldn't be the same as they are now.
It would have ended by the end of Afghanistan.
The psychology of the Arabs and Muslims is to side with whoever fights the occupier.
If bin Laden would be caught or killed right now,
- would it make any difference?
- Nothing.
Nothing whatsoever.
Zarqawi was killed and nothing happened.
And if bin Laden and Zawahiri got killed, nothing will happen.
Because Al-Qaeda has become an intercontinental idea, the same as globalization.
[Morgan] And that idea is reaching more and more people each day.
With Operation Special Delivery only seven weeks away,
I need to go back to the beginning.
And the beginning for Osama is Saudi Arabia.
Saudi Arabia is a country ruled by one family, and governed by one brand of fundamental Islam, Wahhabism.
Osama was born here.
He went to school here.
And, in the late '70s, he was radicalized here.
[man in Arabic] O God, one leader to lead jihad for your sake.
To liberate the land of Palestine.
And the land of Iraq from the Christians.
O God, the strong and noble one.
O God, go after the Christians.
O God, make wars in their homes.
O God, release your armies upon them.
O God, make the land of Palestine a graveyard for the Jews.
O God, make the land of Iraq a graveyard for the Christians.
[Morgan] Do you feel America is trying to fight a war against the religion of Islam?
[in Arabic] Well, look at what you did in Iraq and Afghanistan.
Well, they went to Afghanistan to get Osama bin Laden.
And the Taliban wouldn't give him up.
Was it an act of aggression or not?
We were seeking peace in Afghanistan.
You went there with an ambulance or with a tank?
[laughter]
That's a good question.
Do you think Osama bin Laden caused 9/1 1?
If one man in a cave was able to do this...
What if all Muslims were to resist against America under the leadership of one man?
See, but I don't think 1.2 billion Muslims think the same way you think.
One single verse from the Koran and they will come.
So why has no one said that verse yet?
These things get planned.
Don't disregard it as unlikely.
What if we were to burn the refineries, just to deprive you of the oil?
[Morgan] You said Saudi Arabia is a country divided.
What do you mean by that?
Not divided, but not yet building the national unity we are looking for.
One important issue in the Kingdom, is to organize the relation between the religious establishment and the political establishment.
This issue hasn't been resolved yet, and it must be resolved.
Otherwise, extremists, terrorists, may dictate some of their ideologies on us.
And we still have so many people, who are refusing to accept the reality.
Are there still radicals within the country?
We still have a lot.
And they are dangerous, by the way.
We should not underestimate the ability of the extremists.
Those people are ready to die.
Those people are ready to destroy.
Those people are ready to kill themselves, kill their families, they don't care about life.
Therefore, I think they are a threat us, in Saudi Arabia, then to other countries, then to the world.
[man] In an unprecedented nine month operation netting more than 170 Al-Qaeda suspects, and more than five million dollars,
Saudi intelligence officials say they thwarted plans to fly aircraft into oil facilities, attack security installations, kill senior officials and send money to Al-Qaeda in Iraq.
But the raids reveal a far more worrying trend for the Saudis.
The war in Iraq is spilling over into Saudi Arabia.
Right in front of the head office of the Mutawwa'un, the religious police, is Chop Chop Square.
I'm standing right on the drain where they...
[makes slicing noises] ...cut people's heads off, and the blood goes into that drain.
Everybody stands around and watches.
They kill people in the morning and then play soccer in the afternoons.
What a place.
[Morgan] It's complete culture shock for me to be in Saudi Arabia.
An absolute other world, from anything I've ever experienced, any place I've ever been.
We've been to Egypt and Morocco and Jordan, and the Palestinian territories, and these places are so progressive by comparison.
There is no separation of church and state.
Church is the state, state is the church.
The religion and the ideology is what runs everything.
Boys and girls separated from the time they're ten.
You can't see La Perla's brassiere ad.
That's wrong.
Oh, you can't see Posh Spice's shoulder.
You can't see the knee or the thigh.
- Can't I police my own thoughts?
- No.
[Morgan] That's the problem when a country's built entirely on marriage between church and state.
There isn't much room for moderates.
There's no freedom of speech or freedom of the press, speaking or writing anything critical of the royal family is illegal.
Public protest is actually forbidden.
The Ministry of Information monitors the Web for any immoral content, but websites supporting Al-Qaeda seem to get through just fine.
[Morgan] What do fundamentalists hope to achieve?
Power in the name of God.
That's where I don't like it.
They manipulate the Islamic teachings to fit different situations, different conditions,
- to, ultimately, lead them to power.
- Yeah.
I don't think a religious person, be it Christian, Jewish or Muslim, by his own upbringing and teaching, is qualified to be a public official.
He's just not.
Politics is completely different from religion.
I don't think any religious person is qualified to be a public official.
A good amount of secularism in every Arab political system is badly needed.
Drawing clear lines between where an lmam, a priest role, a responsibility ends, and a politician, or a public official's responsibility begins.
We need it for stability.
I'd love to hear your thoughts on Osama bin Laden.
Osama bin Laden, per se, is not the problem.
The school of thought, the followers, the teaching that he has planted in Islamic countries, in the Muslim world, is where the restructuring and the fight should begin.
It's unfortunate, but he is a product of the system, the establishment.
There's no denying that.
We have to accept that.
[Morgan] I went to a school to find what kids are being taught about the west.
[ Jon Spurney:
School Days]
[Morgan] These two young, open-minded, free-thinking students, picked by the administration, are the two I'm allowed to speak to.
Understanding that their teacher and principal be present the whole time.
[Morgan] How old are you guys?
[man in Arabic] Eighteen.
Eighteen, yeah.
So how is it being 1 8 in Saudi Arabia?
[in Arabic] Great.
We have no worries or troubles.
What did you learn about the United States while you were in school?
Actually, we did not study the United States specifically.
What's your opinion of the United States?
I have no definite opinion...
no specific opinion.
I'm just curious what you think about the U.S.
In the United States we hear one idea about Muslim countries,
Saudi Arabia is where the hijackers came from.
Saudi Arabia is the country that makes a lot of money off of oil.
So I'm curious what you guys hear about the United States.
No answer.
You have no answer?
No?
How about you?
Their view is...
Americans always want to dominate...
No, that was the wrong answer...
One of the things we hear a lot in the United States, is that there's a lot of anti-Western, or anti-Semitic things taught in school.
What are you taught about Israel?
[man in Arabic] Stop your cameras.
- What's wrong?
I'm sorry?
- They want to stop.
- They want to stop the whole thing?
- Yes.
OK. [laughs]
How are you to have a discussion, if he can't talk about things?
How are things supposed to change if you can't address them?
Excuse me, I was wondering if we could ask you a question?
Excuse me, I was wondering if you guys could help me?
No?
Could I ask you guys a question?
No?
Do you know anybody who could get me in touch with Osama bin Laden?
Osama bin Laden?
[in Arabic] No, I have no leads.
It's becoming more obvious, Osama never went to the mall.
- So this is a good moisturizer?
- [woman] Yeah.
- lt'll keep my hands really soft?
- Yeah.
- Where can I find Osama bin Laden?
- What?
- You saw him?
- Yes.
Do you know which aisle he was in?
- [laughing]
- Was he down past the Nutella?
Is he in Saudi Arabia?
- Maybe.
- Maybe.
OK.
Maybe you can ask his family.
Maybe they can help you.
- OK.
All right.
- Yeah.
- Cool, I'll do that.
Thanks.
Bye.
- OK.
Bye.
It's a great suggestion.
I'm going to talk to his family.
[ Folkfoot:
Where in the World is Osama bin Laden (Freedom's Call)]
[ Folkfoot:
Where in the World is Osama bin Laden (Freedom's Call)]
OK, this is the Bin Laden Aviation Agency.
How fitting, right?
That's terrible.
Look, I'm not lying.
Right there.
There's the Bin Laden Aviation Agency.
[in Arabic] Where can I marry Osama bin Laden?
- Oh, you don't know?
- [woman] I don't.
[man] Please make sure that you have the correct number.
Your call cannot be completed as dialed.
After 9/1 1, wouldn't you change your number if your last name was bin Laden?
That probably would have been the very first thing I would have done.
I would have been like, "God, Osama, you asshole.
Now I got to change all my phone numbers."
[Morgan] There's a window right there.
[man in Arabic] We would like to ask you some questions about Osama bin Laden.
Yeah.
We're looking for anything.
A phone number, any information we could get.
Anything anybody may know.
He's like, "Do you think he's here?"
I said, "He's not here?" He goes, "Maybe." Maybe!
- He's in the basement.
- Maybe he's in the basement.
I'm looking for Osama bin Laden.
- [laughing]
- Why is that funny?
Why is that funny?
What's wrong with that?
- Where is your car?
- Where is my car?
Why, you going to blow it up or something?
You want to see it?
[Morgan] We're going up to bin Laden's farm.
We're going to go to his place, this house that he built with his own hands.
We're going to talk to people in the village, see if somebody can get me in.
[speaking Arabic]
- [Morgan] That guy said this was it.
- [man] Yeah.
- Not much of a farm.
Look at this.
- Yeah.
It's like a trailer park.
This must be the house.
Let's go.
Let's get out of here.
Man, I should have bought some sandals.
[Morgan] Well, I didn't find OBL, or any good clues in the desert of Saudi Arabia.
But that night I did find Othman Ya al Bari, who's related to one of the 9/1 1 hijackers.
Hopefully, he could point me in the right direction.
He's got professional wrestling on TV, he knows what's good, see?
One of your relatives was said to be one of the hijackers.
- [in Arabic] Yes.
- Yeah.
Was he?
No.
After 9/1 1, there was video of a lot of the hijackers.
A lot of them released video statements.
Do you not think that connects them in some way to what happened?
I don't believe that is solid proof.
America wins all the Oscar awards.
It owns the best studios and technologies in the world.
We've seen the animals, the lion, the dog and the pig, we've seen them in many movies talking like humans.
I feel very uncomfortable with this conversation.
What do you think would drive some people towards wanting to join a group like Al-Qaeda?
What would make them want to go off and fight, possibly lose their lives?
They go because they feel like America... you feel like...
She's trying all kinds of ways to dominate and impose her dominance on the entire world, especially on the Muslim world.
Have you had friends who have gone off to wage jihad?
Yes, of course.
Where did they go?
These youth went first to Afghanistan.
Then America went into Iraq, and they followed.
How many people do you know that went?
- A lot.
- [man] A lot.
And how many have come back?
Unfortunately, nobody came back.
[beeping]
[Morgan] Afghanistan is a country at war for more than 30 years, and it feels like it.
From when the Soviet Union invaded, to civil war, to the Taliban, and now the arrival of U. S. and NATO forces, its impact is everywhere.
Wherever you go there's barricades, barbed wire, people with guns, checkpoints, more people with guns.
And, in the middle of all this, is just this incredible poverty.
I thought the first place to look in Afghanistan for Osama was the last place that he was seen.
So we're heading out to Tora Bora.
They say, "No, no, it's not dangerous at all,"
yet there's 21 guys here with guns...
[laughs] taking us to Tora Bora.
"No, it's fine.
You're not gonna need to worry about it at all."
[Arabic music plays]
Are there a lot of landmines in this area?
[in foreign language] No, not on the path...
- Really?
- Really.
OK.
[Morgan] So, this area here, this was the beginning of Al-Qaeda's base?
[man in Arabic] This is where Osama's headquarters was.
There are large caves on this side and the other side too.
They were full of ammunition, weapons, and food such as tea, sugar and rice.
Look, up there, should we go?
One of our soldiers is shaking the nuts off the tree, 'cause, apparently, if you eat 20 of these nuts...
All night long.
It's the word on the street.
You can rock and roll all night.
Look at that, we got a guy up in the tree to get the magic nuts.
Dude, look at that.
While these guys are playing with their nuts, I think I'll head out on my own.
President Bush said that he wanted to capture Osama bin Laden dead or alive.
The U. S. had its best chance in late November of 2001, when elements of both Afghan and American forces closed in on Osama's mountain hideout.
The following days saw some of the heaviest fighting in all of the war.
Yoo-hoo!
Osama!
And, rather than commit additional U. S. ground forces, the U. S. chose to rely on local Afghan fighters to bring in OBL.
When the dust had settled, Osama was gone.
The governor of the province has ideas how to bring the excitement back.
[in foreign language] Our plan and goal is that Tora Bora should become an international tourism center.
So we want to build a grand amusement park in Tora Bora.
What kind of rides?
Everything will be built.
Maybe a roller coaster.
Everything will be built.
- Water slides?
- Absolutely.
- Ferris wheels?
All of it?
- Yes.
Yes.
You could say, "Tora Bora.
It's the bomb."
[crickets chirping]
[Morgan] I'm not sure how much fun Afghanistan is ready for.
Seems to me they could use a lot more than just roller coasters around here.
[in foreign language] No one has done anything for us.
All the international aid goes to those at the top.
It never makes its way down to us.
You got a tent from the UN.
No, we bought it in the black market!
- No, we buy it in the black market.
- [laughing]
They haven't helped us with land, money or to fix our tent or anything.
Look at this troublemaker!
When we're traveling at night, we have to constantly check the camel to make sure we didn't leave him somewhere.
Have you left him behind before?
Yeah, all the time!
We've lost them many times!
Our lives already passed.
We are concerned about our children.
They should be able to have a better life.
[man] The international community is failing to help this country get on its feet.
Organizations such as USA gauge success by how much money they spend.
Not by what it achieves.
The bigger budget they have, the more impressed they are.
The fact that it doesn't achieve anything, all the clinics don't exist, no one seems to care back in the States, that information doesn't get there.
[in foreign language] No one is helping this place, and if there is, no one is distributing it.
There are more than 800 houses here but no school or hospital.
We are living the same now as we were under the Taliban.
America must hold our government accountable.
America must ask why didn't you pave the streets with the money we gave you.
All those houses were destroyed by foreign countries.
Why don't they rebuild those houses?
They haven't done anything positive here.
Two years ago, the U.S. Ambassador came here and said,
"We're going to make a pledge to rebuild the school." It's been two years.
Look at this place.
This is hearts and minds.
It looks like a bomb went off yesterday.
There's bullet holes.
The front of the building is riddled with bullet holes.
Blast holes.
Nothing's being done.
We've got to do something for these kids.
We've gotta do something for these kids to say, "Somebody cares about us.
Somebody cares about us getting educated.
Somebody wants us to be in a safe environment."
[Morgan] As somebody about to become a father for the first time, it's so instilling in me, reminding me, of the things that I want for my family.
I don't ever want my child to be in a position where they can't be educated.
Or can't feel like they can better themselves, like that this is it.
That this is as good as it gets for their life, and to not have hope that tomorrow is going to be better.
- [phone ringing]
- Ow.
- [phone ringing]
- Ow.
Man, this baby starts kicking as soon as your phone rings.
- Baby knew I was calling.
- We miss you.
Baby knew.
Ow!
- Oh, I miss you so much.
- Yeah.
Me, too.
[Morgan] I dreamt we had a girl last night.
[woman] That's cute.
[Morgan] Ever see Osama bin Laden around here?
[in foreign language] God know, if we catch him, we will tear him apart.
Osama bin Laden's Afghan's enemies.
[in foreign language] Who is Osama?
He is the one who destroyed those buildings in America.
Fuck him.
And fuck America.
I'm looking for Osama bin Laden.
- Pakistan.
- Pakistan?
- Pakistan.
- OK!
Pakistan?
Pakistan.
[in foreign language] It is very obvious to the world that he is hiding in Pakistan.
You should find him so we have peace in the world.
[Morgan] I'm looking for Osama bin Laden.
[in foreign language] Tribal area.
Near Peshawar?
[heart beat on speaker]
That is so cool.
I love you so much.
I love you too, baby.
[imitating heartbeat]
That was my baby's little disco heartbeat.
What will happen if I go to Pakistan to look for him?
[in foreign language] You will find him.
I will find him?
You want to come look for him with me?
No?
[laughing]
Why not?
I'll miss my family.
- [man] I'm gonna miss my family.
- You'll miss your family.
I miss my family very much.
If I went into the tribal area, you think I'd be OK?
[in foreign language] God knows what will happen if you go there.
Something terrible will happen to you.
You're finished.
The Taliban will cut your head.
- They'll cut my head?
Yeah.
- Yeah.
Ugh!
So Alex started getting contractions last night.
Braxton Hicks contractions, which aren't real contractions, but it's your body preparing for a contraction.
And, here I am, missing it all.
And, here I am, missing it all.
Missing it all, man, missing it all.
[man singing in Arabic]
[Morgan] We just found out from U.S. military that we can go out on an embed.
And it's frightening.
But the most important thing, for me, is to try and, hopefully, just narrow down the path to finding the most wanted man on the planet.
How much they're actually looking for this guy, who knows?
But we'll find out.
This stuff is so heavy.
Everything in your body tells you you shouldn't be going to a job, or doing something where you gotta wear a bulletproof vest.
[man] The next thing you'll see here in America you'll see terrorism.
If you don't think you'll see, you're blinding yourself to the historic development of everything taking place on this earth.
Terrorism.
Terrorism.
[man] First of all, I'd like to welcome all of you guys to Firebase Apache.
- What questions do you have?
- Will we be able to speak to any of the people in the area who actually live in the local villages?
Um, when you go out to 4-2, yeah.
- There's a village right next to them.
- OK.
And that village also happens to be full of Taliban.
[woman] I'd like to remind you, while talking about going outside the wire.
When whoever we're with, whoever's escorting us says, "Let's go,"
get in the vehicle and go.
It doesn't mean finish your question.
It means go now.
[Leppert] This is hardcore Taliban country, let me tell you.
Over those mountains, that's Afghanistan.
If you go over those mountains, that's Pakistan.
We're centrally located with a lot of activity around us.
[Morgan] Will we stop in a village tomorrow?
- Yes, we will.
- What's the plan for the afternoon?
We're fogbound, we'll test fire weapons, talk, whatever you want.
You've got free rein.
I had a lot of grouping right beside the guy.
Well, if nothing else, it scared the hell out of him.
Can I try a rocket launcher?
[laughing] That was awesome.
You've been here six months.
You might be able to tell me.
Where is Osama bin Laden?
[Leppert] We ask that every time we go out.
"Hey?
You guys know where Osama's at?" They always point up to the mountains.
[in foreign language] Where's Osama?
[laughter]
- [Morgan] Where's Osama bin Laden?
- I have no clue.
Is he alive?
Even if he was, I don't think we'd know.
We are going to stop and speak to villagers.
They said I should write my blood type on anything that'd be attached to me.
Scary as shit, man.
What we're concentrating on is your security.
That's it.
In a firefight I'm going to come in.
Come to this effect, bring you in and we'll grab you to here.
As soon as I do, I'm going to try to grab you again.
As soon as it's safe, then we're going to move out.
When we go out, we expect to have contact.
We expect to get shot at.
Anything goes out there.
We always got to be ready for everything.
[man] This is what we call a "friendly village."
[laughter] [man] Once they understand it's their choice to talk, the forces will stand back.
And then whoever wants to talk to you will talk to you.
[man] Morgan, come up, let's introduce you.
Yes, sir.
[in foreign language] This person is a civilian from America and wants to ask you some questions.
His name is Morgan.
[Morgan] I was hoping you could tell me your thoughts on the Taliban and the current conflict happening.
[in foreign language] What do you think, who is happy with battles?
No one is happy with battles.
We are not happy.
We don't like the war.
We want a peaceful life.
We are neither your friends nor the Taliban's.
We just want a simple life.
What are things, when you look at your village, you need the most?
In terms of assistance.
The most important problem is the lack of water.
Before the base drilled their well we didn't have any water problems.
- What do you think of Osama bin Laden?
- [man] Morgan!
Let's go now!
Now!
- Come on!
- Let's go now!
[man on radio] Be advised, I've just been informed of an ambush, possibly the governor's convoy.
[man 2] And we are in pursuit of two individuals on foot.
Jedi-1, we're at 2-0-6.
That village to our left is where the Taliban went to.
We have one downed Taliban.
We have their motorcycle in our possession.
Over.
[Morgan] People have said Afghanistan is a winnable war.
What are your thoughts?
In counter-insurgency, killing doesn't work.
Got to work on the center of gravity, the people.
They like having clean water, having a medical clinic.
They like seeing their kids go to school.
It just makes it more difficult for the Taliban to change the tide and get the people to go to the other side.
[in foreign language] Thank you and please tell your commander the father of Taza Gui says peace.
[Morgan] What would have happened if we had sent more troops here in 2002?
You would have killed more Taliban, but, I mean, we're killing a lot of Taliban right now.
And they've got the open sieve from the madrassas of Pakistan in the refugee camps that go to these young kids who don't have a job, who have no positive outlook in life.
They sell them with a lot of propaganda.
Tell them they're going to give their family money, bring them here.
- Where is Osama?
- I think he's in Pakistan.
[beeping]
I think it's quite likely that Osama bin Laden is in Pakistan.
[woman] The latest intelligence has always seemed to indicate that he is in Pakistan.
[man] He's probably somewhere along that border region.
- Pakistan.
- Along that border.
Tribal areas of Pakistan.
Senior leadership, number one and two are there.
On the Pakistan border it's particularly dangerous, a region where terror rules.
And where many believe Osama bin Laden could be hiding.
Everyone I've spoken to said this is where Osama's hiding out.
[Morgan] Everyone, that is, except for Pakistanis.
- Where is Osama?
- [Morgan] You tell me.
- Where is Osama?
- I'm looking for him.
You tell me.
[in foreign language] He's in Afghanistan.
Osama bin Laden is here.
Afghanistan.
Osama bin Laden...
Which animal is that?
I don't where he is, but it's also a question if he's alive or dead.
But, um, his influence is here.
[in foreign language] He is a great soldier of the Muslims.
He is fighting for righteousness.
He's a diamond.
Osama is exploiting the root causes.
If we find the root causes, we'll solve everything.
- Osama bin Laden is nothing, sir.
- He is only one!
One person!
Dude, look at that.
Even in Pakistan they love wrestling.
- All the people like the wrestling.
- Tell me why you like wrestling.
- Because wrestling is fair.
- Can I let you in on a little secret?
- It's fixed.
- Fixed?
- Fixed.
It's not real.
- Maybe.
- You are right.
I know.
You are right.
- OK.
Good.
But when it is for a belt, then it is not fixed.
I'm looking, uh...
How are you?
How are you?
Hi.
I'm just looking...
[Morgan] Just based on what everybody has said, I got to think we're within a couple hundred miles of where he is.
Maybe even less.
Yeah, OK.
OK.
Thank you.
Tomorrow we're heading into this area of the tribal regions, just past Peshawar, where everyone has told me Osama bin Laden is.
I mean, I have no idea what to expect when I get there.
I've been traveling for months to try and find this person that everybody we talk to...
You know, they all say,
"Why are you looking for this person?
What is he?
He's one man?"
The thing that I've realized is that this whole trip is a chance to actually go out and see and talk to those people that we're told to be so scared of all the time.
I'm not somebody who thinks we can sit around the campfire and sing Kumbaya, you know?
That's ridiculous.
[laughing]
But I believe that we create these demons within ourselves.
And we create these demons within the media.
And we create these visions that are so beyond reality.
They start feeding themselves after a while.
Our fear just becomes exponential.
They say when you go looking for trouble, you'll find it.
It's not that I'm looking for trouble.
I'm just looking for answers.
And I think I've found a lot.
I think I've found a lot on this trip.
"Attention.
Entry of foreigners is prohibited beyond this point."
Even if I go over the border to find Osama, it's not going to, suddenly, make the world safer for my kid.
The things that are pushing people to follow him and his ideas are still going to be there.
And that's what we have to change.
I think that we need to take a step back and really ask ourselves, "What kind of a world do we want to live in?
What do we want that world to be?"
It's not worth it.
So her water just broke, which is very exciting.
So, I'm that much closer.
- OK.
- OK?
You want to get up?
[Alex groaning] [laughter]
[woman] It's your son!
- [Morgan] It's a boy!
- [Alex] We have a baby boy!
- We have a baby boy.
- Oh, my God!
He's beautiful.
- [crying] - [laughter]
[Morgan] So, I didn't end up finding Osama.
What I did find, is that there are a lot more people out there who are just like us, than there are who are just like him.
I'll always bet on the billions of regular people to win over the crazies.
After all, we all want the same things for our families.
We want the world to be a place where we can raise and love our kids.
Where they can have everything they need to be happy, healthy, without it blowing up around them.
It's not going to be easy.
And all that reward money sure would have helped but, hey, you know what?
He's going to love public school.
[ Elvis Costello The Attractions:

[ Woman Screaming ]
- No.

Where are you going?
Go!

No!
[ Screaming ]
[ Woman ] Help!
[ Screams ]
- [ Pants ] - [ Grunts ]
This way!
[ Groans ]
My palace shall be a shelter.
We'll tend to the wounded here.
By your word, King Gilgamesh.
[ Groaning ]
[ Gilgamesh ] My people.
The gods have turned against us.
As your king, I'm asking for your strength, now more than ever.
In return, I give you my word that I will not rest... until Sumeria is safe again.
But, sire, your father is king of the gods, and if he's turned against his own son, what hope do we have?
I've sent for a man across the seas... a hero who will not bow down to the will of the gods.
Perhaps, with his help, we can restore our homeland... to its former glory.
[ Shoveling ] [ Gasps ]
[ Grunts ] Oh!
[ All Laughing ]
[ Woman ] Thank the gods!
There you go.
That was fun!
Can we do it again?
[ Laughing ] Sorry, kiddo.
Only the, uh, first ride is free.
Besides, I don't think your mother would approve.
Oh!
Thank you, Hercules.
You're welcome.
[ Man ] His strength!
Just wait till your father gets home!
[ Chuckles ]
Ha, ha, ho!
My hero!
Ooh!
There you go!
[ Man ] Don't pile it up too high!
Now, then, where were we?
Oh, yes.
Your theory.
[ Laughs ] I'm telling you, lolaus.
The Earth is round.
Okay, let's say for argument's sake that it is round.
That means there are people underneath us who are upside down, right?
That's right.
And to them, we're upside down.
Okay, so how come we just don't fall off into the clouds?
Huh?
I'm workin' on it.
[ Woman ] Who are they?
[ Man ] I don't know.
They're not from around these parts.
Huh.
[ Man ] Set them down over there.
I'll get to them in a moment.
I beg your pardon.
Are you the one they call Hercules?
[ Scoffs ] Among other things.
Ow.
Can I help you?
I have traveled here from Sumeria... as emissary to King Gilgamesh, son of the almighty deity, Ra.
[ Laughing ] Ra?
Uh, he's not talking about the Greek gods.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
You mean there are other gods out there?
[ Emissary ] They have turned against us, Great One.
- Our cities lay in ruin, while our people hide in fear.
- Sounds familiar.
Come to Sumeria with me.
I beg of you.
You're our only hope.
W
- W-Wait...
There's, uh, no need to beg.
We'll be glad to help.
- It's about time we broaden our horizons.
- [ Sighs ]
[ Thunderclap ]
[ Man Narrating ] This is the story of a time long ago, a time of myth and legend, when the ancient gods were petty and cruel, and they plagued mankind with suffering.
Only one man dared to challenge their power...
Hercules.
Hercules possessed a strength the world had never seen, a strength surpassed only by the power of his heart.
He journeyed the earth, battling the minions of his wicked stepmother, Hera, the all-powerful queen of the gods.
But wherever there was evil, wherever an innocent would suffer, there would be...
Hercules.
- [ Screeching ] - [ Roaring ]
Hail!
Now let me get this straight.
Your king, Gilgamesh, he's a god?
Like you, Great One, the blood of an immortal flows through his veins, but his heart is human.
Um, Great One?
Can I have a word with you?
[ Sighs ]
- Call me Hercules.
- As you wish.
You spend too long underwater in that well?
No.
Hit your head?
Not that I can remember.
Little kid, uh, hold you too tightly around the neck?
I'm sure there's a point to this.
The point is, Hercules, we don't know anything about these other gods.
[ lolaus ] Look, it's not as though we don't have problems of our own.
I know these gods are different from ours, but people aren't.
They need help.
We cannot turn our backs on them.
Huh?
Well, that's it.
We go down in history as the guys that ticked off all the gods.
If something's worth doing, it's worth doing well, right?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
So, how do we get to Sumeria, swim?
I think I know where we can find a boat.
[ Laughs ]
[ Screeching ]
Two barrels, like we agreed.
Let's do this.
I ain't gonna give ya a dinar for 'em, Nebula.
Them eels is female.
You're kidding, right?
I might take ''' em off your hands, if you were prepared to throw in a little something... extra.
[ Men Laughing ]
I'll think about it. [ Man ] Aye, aye!
- I don't think so.
- [ Screams ]
[ Electrical Crackling, Popping ]
[ Nebula ] Shocking, isn't it?
[ Electrical Crackling Continues ] [ Men Shouting ]
[ Screams ]
[ Shouts ]
- [ Hercules ] Doesn't look like she needs our help.
- [ Screams ]
[ Shouting ]
I'll be with you in a moment, boys.
- [ Hercules ] Take your time.
- [ Groaning ]
[ Shouts ]
[ Shouting ]
- Or you can give me a hand!
- Just wanted to hear you ask.
- [ Electrical Crackling ] - [ Screams ]
Going up.
[ Grunts ] [ Screeching ]
Oh!
[ Men Shouting ]
- [ Eels Screeching ]
- Huh.
[ Screeching Dies Down ]
Do you have any idea what I went through to catch those things?
[ Panting ] You're welcome.
My princess.
I thought we'd never see you again.
The king will be overjoyed to know that his sister... is safe.
- Sister?
[ Screams ] Oh!
- Princess?
Forget it!
There's no way I'm goin' back!
Your brother is in trouble, Nebula.
Those people need help.
Half brother, and those people never needed my help.
You boys have any idea what it's like to be a Sumerian princess?
No.
Can't say that we do.
There is no position of power for a woman in Sumeria.
You look pretty and you keep your mouth shut.
No way I was gonna let tradition determine the course of my destiny.
I understand how you feel, but if we don't get there soon, those people will die.
I don't think you want that.
Persuasive, isn't he?
[ Nebula ] Hopefully, the winds will be at our backs.
Are you... all right?
[ Sighs ] Nothin' like leaving port.
Nebula.
See, in Sumeria, I may be a princess, but here I'm a queen.
My country, my borders.
I go wherever I want, whenever I want to.
That's real power, Goldilocks.
I don't think we've been introduced properly.
See, my name is lolaus.
Iolaus.
You're awfully cute when you're angry.
I understand you better than you think, Nebula.
Do you now?
Ah.
Oh, yeah.
"My country, my borders"?
You don't like people getting too close to you 'cause you don't wanna be tied down.
I never said I didn't wanna be tied down.
[ Laughs ]

[ Men Laughing, Chattering ]
[ Man ] Yeah!
Some action!
Oh.
Quite a grip you got there.
This must be the hand you use to...
Stow it, sister.
You're goin' down.
Talk to your captain like that.
Time for a beating, baldy.
[ Laughing ]
[ Man #1 ] My money's on the captain!
[ Man #2 ] You don't have any money!
My princess.
It's highly improper for a woman of royalty to behave in this manner.
[ Laughs ]
Boys!
[ Man ] Let him have it, Nebula!
Our guest seems a little tense.
Help him relax.
[ Cheering ]
[ Man ] What's your poison?
Come on!
[ Sighs ]
- She's quite a handful.
- [ lolaus ] Yeah.
Too much of a handful.
I don't know how the crew puts up with her. [ Hercules ] I don't know.
They seem to be enjoying themselves just fine.
Come on, Hercules.
They're drunk.
They don't know any better.
Put a little muscle into it!
You like her.
What are you, nuts?
She's stubborn and single-minded... hotheaded!
That's enough about you.
Let's talk about her.
Hey, hey...
If you got something to say...
I know you...
I
- I know you, lolaus.
And sometimes when that stubborn, single-minded, hotheaded side takes over, you... forget to follow your heart.

Is that so?
Hmm. [ Chanting Continues ]

You're having doubts about what you're doing, aren't you?
[ Gasps ]
Maybe it's not my place to get involved with these other gods.
I just hope I'm doing the right thing.
And what if you aren't?
Are you prepared to fail?
That's a chance I'll have to take.
That's the wrong answer.
- When are you gonna realize your struggle is in vain?
- My struggle?
Save the world from evil.
As if evil were an enemy to be kept outside the castle walls.
It's everywhere.
- Even inside you.
- Maybe.
- That doesn't mean I'm gonna stop trying.
- But at what cost?
Deianeira?
Serena?
Your precious children?
They've all paid the price for your arrogance.
How do you expect to save the world, Hercules, when you can't even save the people you love?
Who are you?
Who are you?
I am the darkness that you hold closest to your heart.

[ Men Chattering ]
Land ho!
What's the matter, Herc?
You look like you've seen a ghost.
Maybe I did.
What happened?
I had a dream... maybe more of a nightmare.
When I woke up, I had this.
This is it, boys.
Ride ends here.
Sure you won't change your mind?
You came all this way.
Appreciate the effort, but you know what they say... you can't go home again.
Well, we tried.
Yeah.
My king.
May I present Hercules and Iolaus.
It is an honor to have you here, Hercules.
The honor is mine, King Gilgamesh.
This is my friend, lolaus.
I only wish that we could've met under different circumstances.
This way.
It looks like you've got your hands full.
Our food and water supplies are running short.
Soon, the dead will outnumber the living.
Why have your gods done this?
To punish me.
[ Gasping, Groaning ]
Not long ago, my kingdom was attacked by an army of pagans.
Many of our temples were destroyed.
I led my people to battle.
I left my wife and child behind.
When I returned, I found them slaughtered.
I was out fighting for the gods, and they didnothing to protect my family.
I lost my faith, Hercules, in their goodness.
And now my people are paying the price.
You can't... blame yourself, Gilgamesh.
There's always hope.
There has to be a way to stop this.
There is.
But I can't do it by myself.
Come with me.
I have something to show you.
How long have you been standing there?
Long enough.
I always knew that you'd return.
I prayed that you would.
I'm sorry about your family.
Youare my family now.
These tablets record our history, from the first days of my people.
I remember.
When the first Sumerians came here, it was a desert.
Then the gods fasted for seven days on the nectar that sustains them... to give life to the land.
So if we get some of this nectar, we can restore the land.
That's why I sent for you.
The nectar flows from this chalice, but it was hidden by the gods in the middle of the pyramid, protected by a series of trials.
Only those with the blood of a god can reach it.
If you're willing to come with me, Hercules, together...
we may stand a chance.
What are we waiting for?
[ Chattering ]
It's my fault that you left.
No, it isn't.
I put duty and tradition before family.
The people have lost a princess, but I lost a sister.
I was wrong, but you knew that all along.
Still, I should have been there for you.
You're here now.
You know, um, you were right about her.
She's not bad.
Hmm.
And maybe you're not so stubborn. [ Laughs ] [ Laughs ]
Well, don't tell anybody.
No.
Good luck.
Yeah.
You too.
[ Sighs ]
We'll be back.
[ Bird Cawing ]
Hercules.
I'm curious.
Tell me about your Greek gods.
Well...
I don't think they're much different than yours.
It seems like I've spent my whole life trying to solve the problems they create.
Hmm.
Funny.
I spent my whole life looking to my gods for guidance... like a fool.
Ah, don't be too hard on yourself.
I used to think they had answers that people didn't.
I guess we both learned the hard way.
You know, I wish I had met you a long time ago.
Perhaps you could've spared me some disappointment.
I know how you feel, 'cause I lost...
I lost family too.
I wanted to give up on myself, on the world.
Why didn't you?
[ Sighs ] Because...
I have faith in people.
[ Laughs ]
So long as they don't give up, I can't either.
Mm-hmm.
[ Door Opens ] Our water supply has been cut off!
[ People ] Oh, no!
The aqueduct has been badly damaged!
These people won't survive another night without water.
We better get to fixing that duct.
[ Man ] Sacrilege.
[ Murmuring ]
[ Nebula ] Is there a problem?
[ Emissary ] My princess.
I must remind you that you are in Sumeria now.
It would be improper for you to do a man's job.
Give me a break!
You're all just gonna stand there because you don't want to work with a woman?
[ People Murmuring ]
- Come on, guys...
- I don't need your chivalry, pal.
You can all just kiss off!
[ Door Slams Shut ]
[ Murmuring Continues ]

There's nowhere to go but up.
Look at this.
You'll have to do the honors.

We're not looking for a trail.
We have to walk in each other's footsteps.

Whoa!
[ Both Grunting ]
[ Straining ]
[ Straining ] Like you said, only way to go is up. [ Grunts ]
Wait!
People are dying, and they refuse to take my help!
I never should have listened to you and Hercules.
Nothinghas changed!
Yes!
You're right!
But if you leave now, nothing ever will!
Are you blind?
I left because I refused to waste my life fighting a losing battle!
So now you fight it everywhere but here!
- Who are you to talk to me that way?
- Someone who cares about you.
Yes, it's true, Nebula.
Someone actually cares about you.
And if you leave now, you're gonna regret it for the rest of your life.
What am I supposed to do?
Show them what you've shown me...
That you don't take orders from anybody but yourself.
- [ Woman Moans ] - [ Emissary ] Oh, Deity, our injured need water.
[ Man ] Hear our prayers.
Please, show us a sign that you have not abandoned us.
[ Whistles ]
Listen up, boys.
We got a lot of work to do, and a short time to do it in.
Howdareyou interrupt our prayers.
Your sacrilege will be the death of us all!
I'm gonna let you in on a little secret.
The gods aren't gonna help us.
And if you haven't figured that out, you're a lot dumber than you look.
All right, boys.
In my brother's absence, I will assume his authority, beginning now.
You can stand here and wait for a miracle, or you can come with me and fix this thing.
Well, uh, I don't know about you guys, but, um,
I'm thirsty.
[ Man #1 ] She's right.
Let's go.
[ Man #2 ] What have we got to lose?
[ Man #3 ] I'll go too.
[ All Murmuring ] [ Man ] Yes.
[ Grunts ] [ Grunts ]
Whoa!
This place isn't big on floors, is it?
"Only a blind man can see his way through the eye. "
[ Wind Howling ]
[ Sighs ]
[ Wind Howling Grows Louder ]
I get the feelin' this is gonna blow.
We...
We gotta find another way to make it!
No, we don't!
We can jump!
Jump?
What, do you know something I don't know?
"Only a blind man will see his way through the eye"...
The eye of the whirlwind!
If we don't make it, we got a long way to fall!
We'll make it if we have faith!
Blind faith!

Well, not bad, Nebula.
Not bad yourself, lolaus.
Wait a minute.
Did you just call me "Iolaus"?
I owe you a thanks.
So... thanks.
Ha!
What have you done with the real Nebula?
All right.
I deserve that.
Nah, I kind of like you like this.
Like what?
I don't know.
Uh, off guard.
Nebula, are you blushing?
[ Laughs ] [ Giggles ]
They'll be all right.
I know.
I never thought I'd come back here.
But seeing my brother and these people in such pain...
This is the first time that I've felt... like I actually have a place here.
So why do you look so sad?
Because I know that, uh... that sooner or later, you're gonna go back to Greece. [ Sighs ]
And I think I might miss you.
I bet that's the last thing you expected to hear from me.
Yeah, you're right.
But, um, I hoped you'd say it anyway.
I can't ask you to stay, lolaus.
You and Hercules have a destiny that's very different from mine.
And if you gave that up, you'd always wonder if you made a mistake.
[ Sighs ] Yeah.
But the thing is, if I leave, I'll always ask myself the same thing.
[ Crumbling, Creaking ]
We did it.
Let's grab some of that nectar and get out of here.
After you, my friend.
[ Groans ] [ Groans ]
[ Groans ]
Ahh.
None left for the gods.
What a pity.
Soon the world will tremble... with the arrival of Dahak.
I trusted you.
Please, don't think too badly of me.
You see, Hercules, we're... we're in the middle of a war, and in war, there's always...
betrayal.
You betrayed more than just me.
The destruction that you've seen across the land... is the direct fallout from a battle raging high above... between the gods andmymaster.
You see, when I lost my family,
I did lose my faith.
And in my deepest despair,
I heard the voice of Dahak...
[ Grunting ] a voice so pure, so true,
I knew I had found salvation.
I'd like to meet him.
I bet we'd have a lot to talk about.
You already have.
He's the darkness that you hold closest to your heart.
[ Dahak ] I am the darkness that you hold.
[ Gilgamesh ] Without the nectar, the gods won't be strong enough... to prevent Dahak's arrival.
All he needs is the sacrifice of a warrior heart.
You took the easy way out.
You couldn't face your pain, so you gave up on yourself... and everyone who believed in you!
You are a fool, Hercules.
You're blinded by your own...
goodness.
In a way, you're your own...
worst enemy.
Wrong.
- Now I'm yours.

My equipment finds out whatever hostages it has in the house.
I want a complete analysis of the situation.
And you say everything to me what you know.
Later we will see.
The Inspector will do it to Fisher, he will respond all questions.

Here she is the official of the Commando.
This it is the Marshall Roth.

Jon Harderberg, is the manager of three important companies.
She is a great retailer and important politician also.
There is no reason for special treatment.
You know, frankly not me it interests your opinion.

It has sense.
You did why it?
Because they were guilty.
There was no another way.
He is everything.
For that reason, you committed that massacre.
- Era a boy, them master also. -.
Also you would kill to me?
That depends on you.
It remembers, we have enough time in the world.
And you would not have to pass it with...
Cállate.
It does not have anything to see with you.
The master.
If, and it loves you to you.
Cállate.
It is a simple question.
It loves to you?
- Or it loves the crime...
- Cállate.
Déjame preguntarte something.
When you lost your baby.
And you went to the hospital, it was to your side?
Wine when it could.
It could not do nothing on the matter.
He was unconscious when they cleared it to me.
Meaning that you do not know if it were an accident.
That it was an accident.
He is guilty, we go, affection.
That man is a criminal pathetic and always he will be it.
The master and it loves to me.
You know, the question that you did to me before.
No, it would not do it.

You would have of irte.
I do the best thing than it can.
You jeopardize my position.

And if you try to stop to me.
I will make sure that you finish your race in a quarter.
Very well.
This it is the treatment.
While it follows here.
You will not do what you want due to your son.
And all your plan will be side.
Aló.
It is Roth, the officer by slot.
We need to know that everything the family is to good.
What happens and so I asked?
We will not speak of request until it speaks with the family.
What happens with the treatment that I did with the other?
I am the unique one with that you will negotiate.
I have a man here.
That it will be cagará in its pants at any time.
I also have its daughter.
So I want happens surely now.
You fix the plan?
It will never work.
We will go by the front, we will raise the ceiling of the front.
The arms do not work, we will have to fly it.
But this way it is more successful.
It is very far from them.
It is probable that they are to the front, he is better to take back.
It will be a massacre, no we can do that.
What you suggest?
We can enter privily.
Quarter by quarter, beginning from the cellar.
They will not find out.
If, but there is a problem.
That if there is a barricade somewhere.
He will be more dangerous for the hostages.
Without mentioning if there is some inside.
I will also enter.
It is of the hospital, they say that he is urgent.
Roth, if.
What?
Nick, I must know.
You had weapon when we had the accident?
Not, I cannot remember, long ago.
Then it is truth.
Why it worries to you that now?
They were perhaps because they thought that eras you.
Then, you say that it was my fault.
Hello.

They see, you are not scared, I am tied, watches.
What is that sound?
Why is heard nothing?
He is strange, certain?

They treated it in emergencia, but there was lost many blood.
He was my unique son.
They put something to him in its wound.

We go outside.
I will not continue hoping.
All ready one, enters immediately.

One fallen, is in the kitchen.
What demon was that?

We go, vetoes to the quarter, it is not surely here.
Okey.
Óyeme, psychopath.

If the commando asks to him who and when?
It killed all the family faces of its eyes, what delays?
You are right I feel, it.
Vámonos.
It tracked the daughter.
It is necessary to find out if still she is alive.
And if it is not?
I am certainly that assassin will not see the morning.
We cannot shoot to him without no reason.
You want a reason.
They see with me.
I only say that we hope see you tomorrow.
Perhaps it was an accident.
Ábrela.
Here it is your reason.
Equivocal, two damn assassins.

This was not your fault.
He was an amiable guest, not why.

Very well with your conversation.
Well, because I do not want to hear it again.
Nothing.

Somebody wants to speak with urgent You.
It takes the message.

The suspect is outside reach.
Aló.

Sight, which apparently.
You, became psychopath with the girl.
What will be the next thing?
She is the girl?
Negative, I only see it him.
Not it, it is a beginning.
To begin is something good.
Permission to shoot?
It shoots.
Soy I, abre puerta.
What step?
They shot me in the kitchen.
What want of us?
They want to us to kill, certain?
Not necessarily.

We are going to continue negotiating.
That means, to be ready for 2do. it attacks.
This time they finish, it.
It has been excusing, I spoke for a little while with 1er.
Minister.
I speak to finish to you in one go.
We speak of Kramer and the other two officials.
And of its son.
Then that?
One assumes that it says to him that the life of the daughter is absolute priority.
And second, it is to catch them.
It can be alive or dead.
It is not well.
Good, still I am a position of this mission.
And there is something more.
If it does not follow the instructions.
It will be removed of his position immediately.
Ponlo to the telephone.
You lost completely the head.
If we remained here, they are going to us to kill.
You know what happens if we leave.
The police will shoot to us.
We needed it.
You cannot believe that.
Affection, now could to kill to me.
Without no hostage, it wants to me.
And there is another thing.
The police of the store.
I believe that he is dead.
Excrement, Nick.
If, already, we must go to us of this country, as we glided.
You know, is nothing in the plan.
We will never leave here.
We will do if it, we will do it to the three.
Okey.

We do not have another option.
On my corpse.
She is not your damn daughter, Celia you know, it.

Okey, this plan was by you.

The things are worse.
But with its aid, we can leave.
They show the girl, in next the 10 minutes.
I will catch to you, piece of excrement.
You know that, you won.
You won, will give us minutes more.
And then what?
And later I will take to you so far where you want.

No, that door stays closed.
And it will not leave this quarter.
You will leave shoot to me.
What you create?
I am going to have to put to me there.
To the front of the window.

Better it is than I do not touch it.
- Well, vámonos.

Déjala.
OH by God.
Good work.
You finish making a call.
No, Sir.
You are tired.
It vetoes to rest.
Thanks, gentleman.
No mate to the equipment, it hears to me?
Disparé to the equipment, you hear to me?
Okey, the attack will be in 15 minutes.
You will enter by door of the front.
And these, will serve as reinforcement.
What has with the daughter?
It cannot leave wounded.
You do not worry, I will be in charge of that.
It does not go to tocarte.
I promise it to you.
By God, you bit to me.
Treatment which we leave here.
You deceived to me, not you I or Nadine worries.
Very well, I have committed errors.
But never I have deceived to you.
You the right of perpetual ownership by my honor.
I will not leave to you.
You do not have to do it, Nick.
You already did it.
We go.
We go.
the police returns.
I will review.
If, its instructions me they were happened.
But the Nadine daughter, she is dead.
A 100% insurance.
If, I gave you order them to shoot.
Understood.
Sight, is somebody to the right.
Who is he?
, from where it came?
Not it.
It hears, robust boy, they are going to you to kick the buttock.
Dog.
It is Roth, they see it?
Negativo.
Somebody that says to me that it sees this type.
Negativo.
- You are well?
- If.
There is no boat.
I only want to be safe that the woman...
How they could leave house with all these idiots.
We go, we must go to us of here.
They see, Nadine, we go.
Pon those of the cellar, I want to know where it is the type.
Hay suspicious in jardín.
The girl is alive.
Nick, you do not do more.
Nothing of violent things.
What?
, why?
Police, does not move.
They back down, want if it, they back down.
They have permission of to shoot, I repeat, shoot.
They back down.
Negative.
Podemos to give hija.
They back down, okey.
Him firing, okey.
Well, thank you very much, that is well.
Affection, the door.
They follow and everything thus it will be well.
That is well, good police.
That is well.
You are an asshole.
How you could put it like hostage.
I feel it, I had to leave they would put a bullet to us.
- Dame the weapon.
- It hopes.
It is not well.
You want the weapon, it takes the damn weapon.
I must save to three.
They go, run.
Curse, had to remain back.
Celia, we can speak?
I do not believe that you understand.
Why it was seated seeing the family.
He is always painful.
When I knew you, you wanted to begin single, is well.
He was something that had to do.
Very well.
Déjame to think that I say to you, is very high there.
I do not believe that you know because I am here.
Well, which I did.
Nobody, except Nadine.
Fodder that.
You to him give the girl, and I can escape together.
What you think?
Or it give Nadine.
And I kill Nick.
What seems to you?
It is what there is.
Or, only there are two options.
Very well, piénsalo.
I will be in the other quarter.
It is going to kill Nick.
As well as to the other.
And there is nothing can to do, because it follows the police.
To where you go?
Well.
It is of Security.
If, Victor Novak, of 42 years, unmarried, wine of Germany for two years.
The company works in the area.
For two days it was dismissed.
It must be to 3er. hostage.
Please, ayúdenos, it calls to 0171-9517345.
Hello, I believe that I will leave Nadine.
Not, I have problems personal.
With your aid, we can motivate it.
In minutes.
What you create?
I do not want molestarte now.
But I do not believe that you of a Nadine.
Why?
It creates stupidly in being super hero, angel guardian.
Of that girl.
And now it really is she bothers with me.
I do not believe that it matters what it happens to me.
Then?
Not.
We find out.
OH no, Victor, we go.
It takes the weapon.
It aims right, okey.
Aló.
It is Roth, what you want?
We want to go out the house.
There is a man here, I kill to all the family.
It wants to Nadine and it has fianc2e.
You speak of the agent of security.
She is not a security agent, he is an assassin.
I understand.
They have the order, they shoot and they enter.
If.
Aló.
It hung the telephone to me.
I go off.
You have completely become crazy.
Cálmate, was a warning shot, the time finishes.
Of what you speak?
, Santo Cielo.
It makes me think that of security he is the assassin.
It is not a bad idea.
I kill innocents.
It thinks to say to him to lawyers who were an accident.
And it will leave in few years.
That does not go with me.
Aló.
Fisher, deme with the Minister.
De the AQS.
By all means of the AQS.
We must look for somebody that it helps us.
Nadine.
In any case they go to me to shoot.
You do not go nowhere, you understand to me?
Very well.
It hurt?
It hurts enough.
So.
What is?
If I clear something to you.
How it is...
I am certainly you have badly eye.
What you say itself you have one?
An eye.
If.
We go, man.
Why beams this?
If, if.
You do not move.
No, there is nothing there.
Better it is than you are decided.
You are not going to rescue much of Nick.
In serious, you cannot be it bothers by always.
Nick.
I will release to you.
You are well?
I love you.
I feel much salary damaged everything.
You know that I love you, the things will be better.
I want that we go away.
We will go away of here.
Hazme a favor, dame the last opportunity, okey.
It is not the moment.
- Please.
- This does not serve.
It already comes, vetoes.
You do not shoot to me, nonaffection.
I believe that he is open.
Affection.
Aló.
It is Roth.
I want hacerte a supply.
Okey, what class of supply?
Tickets free for you and your fianc2ee.
With a condition.
Nothing happens to him to Nadine.
Me entiendes.
If, if.
Pon the car back.
If somebody follows to me I swear to you...
Nobody will follow to you.
It only leaves frees the girl.
Very well.
it takes the car.
They will give the keys me of the car.
So soon you have the girl.
Encárgate of the conductor.
All back, we go.
We go, bastards.
We go, we go.
Hello, it is not inside, I already reviewed.
You will not leave here, Victor.
How he is that of which no we will leave?
Why you did this to us?
To the family and now to the girl.
Okey, I am absolutely innocent.
It is the lying one.
It lay to him to the family and it killed its brother.
It is the curse of all.
Needed he it, Victor.
As it is.
What you are?
Of security, they are in newspapers.
I put the alarms of security.
Of everything, it is practically part of my life.
No, you took off it to somebody.
That does not concern much, Celia.
And you know which is the thing more important.
A together family.
Even until in the death.
Their parents deceived to you?
No, I am not so desperate.
Treatment of never being abused.
I am very astute and completely happy.
It amused to you?
You are good.
I believe that I like.
You would be.
Very good, and together.
Jodete.
If, I believe that the information she is true.
It tries to kill itself.
It goes very fast.
What?
It cannot say that to me.
No, You escúchame.
Aló.
It is an order of he himself.
I believe that somebody it will do my work.
I will not leave my position.
Until it is realized the other attack.
You know to which I talk about, Fisher.
If the girl dies.
Your you will have the credit.
What I said to you, went away.
Why always... damn bastard.
Jodete.
We go by first, where she is the girl?
- There is something on Victor.
- If.
For years work in Chicago.
Before beginning to work here, the family was dead in the house.
The pieces are together.
They follow the sign to him.
Dilo substitute.
It is above?
Well, it is sufficient.
Very well, we follow.
It is here?
- Cellar.
- If.
- In the cellar.
- If.
That to please it has hiding.
There is time enough.
It will never happen.
We will follow.
Nadine.
You are a small one.
You will not find it.
It was your fault.
You are not very good.
You will not have to us.
He is the last man that you will see.
You are better than.
We go, first.
Affection.
You do not forget it.
You understand.
If. if.
Where he is Victor?
It is dead, I killed it.
What?
It is in the cellar.
You speak in serious.
It is dead, you really killed Victor.
You are incredible.
Fantastic.
I am proud of you, affection.
It sees and it looks for Nadine and vámonos of here.
I do not go to any site with you.
Why?
Because I really do not want.
I am finished.
Dame chance I will fix, it, vámonos.
To leave me thus.
I am finished.
Vente.
Déjame to be direct.
You say it thus to me.
If Nick, is exactly what I do.
Huge.
Well.
This it is the worse day.
He is really fantastic.
It could not worse be.
You, there.
You two, turn around.
They turn around, expensive to the wall.
We go, of knee.
You shot son to him.
It was an accident.
Celia, dile.
Dispárale.
What?
That is what will happen now.
It promised to me that it would finish, but it did not do it.
Lie only speaks.
Cállate.
To only know how to be mistaken, time and time again.
Because of him you suffer, it kicks the buttock to him.
Thanks, Celia.
So, he is everything, it shoots.
On the other hand.
I do not believe that it is worth the pain.
You are well?
Where he is Victor?
It is down, not you it will bother, I promise it to you.
I want to see it.
You are not going to lower.
Under no circumstance, you would not lower.
You hear to me.
- I do not touch it.
- This good.
You are well?
It is Roth, I need a doctor, express.
I love you.
Something had to leave.
We will go away of here.
If.
If, certainly if.
You know.
What?
He is huge.
I feel much what I happen to you.
If there is something it can do.
Óyeme, you betrayed to me with that call.
- I betrayed to you.
- If.
You wanted to kill them.
They do not follow.
Jodanse.
Previously on Fringe...
It's all right.
I know exactly what I'm doing.
You had your evaluation with Dr. Sumner last night.
He called me to voice some concerns.
It is important that you be completely honest with me, so I can make a recommendation for your continued care whatever that may be.
I don't want to be recommitted.
I can't go back there.
- What are you seeing?
- A young man.
We have a problem.
It is impossible.
He was erased.
And yet traces of him continue to bleed through.
Walter-
- Does he look like this?
I-I've been seeing him in my dreams for the past three weeks.
If we're both seeing the same man, he must be real.
We have to find him!
Hi, Olivia.
Hey.
Did I just step on a peanut?
You're lucky that I convinced him not to use shrimp.
Olivia, how nice of you to visit.
Well, technically, I'm not really visiting, because I-I work here.
Oh, of course.
Hey, Walter, why don't you show Olivia what you're doing?
Oh, I want to capture the apparition that's been haunting us on film.
I have the power of 28 cameras going here.
Walter, if you think that it's possible to capture him on film, why didn't you just use a single video camera?
I believe the apparition may be out of phase with our reality.
And for that reason, he is not visible from all directions.
Instead, he's visible only from one specific angle, which is why I can see him and no one else can.
So.
Multiple cameras taking pictures from multiple angles.
When he shows up again,
I'll have maximized the odds of capturing his image, an idea I got from the fight sequences in The Matrix.
He watched it last night to try and take his mind off his fear.
Now I welcome his visitation.
Any more dreams?
Did he visit again?
No.
But something else did.
When I woke up this morning, there was some kind of energy hovering above my bed.
I know it sounds crazy, but it was making some kind of droning noise, and it seemed to be...
Or it was powerful.
What did it do?
There were all these metal objects gathered in a pile on the floor, like it was collecting.
It touched me.
- Ohh...
- Oh, my.
Walter, do you think that I'm causing this...
Like when I was a child and I set fire to the room?
Let's get a scraping for DNA.
There's no time to waste.
Maybe we can deduce exactly what form of energy is responsible for this.
That should do it.
- Here you go, Walter.
- Thank you.
I'm going to need an atmospheric sample from your apartment as soon as possible.
Of course.
Get closer to the metal objects.
Take a reading there now.
Oh.
It's higher.
Two whole rads at this proximity.
Did you happen to leave a window open?
Uh, yeah.
The bedroom window was open.
Agent Dunham, go to another room.
The bathroom, say.
And find anything metal so they can test whether those metal objects have become magnetized.
What was that?
What's what?
I'm getting some kind of feedback.
- Astrid!
- What's wrong?
What's happening?
Olivia!
What's going on in there?
Walter, what are you talking about?
Astrid!
What's wrong?
Olivia!
What's happening?
So you're saying that your equipment recorded the event before it occurred?
How is that even possible?
Whatever it is, it seemed somehow to affect time.
What are you thinking, Walter?
I'm not sure it caused a time effect before.
Before?
I thought you said you'd never seen anything like this?
Exactly like this, no, but something similar.
25 years ago, when Belly and I did the cortexiphan trials, there was a boy who displayed the beginnings of an ability for astral projection.
Astral projection?
The ability to travel outside the physical body.
And the matter to energy transformation had similar results.
That would explain the radiation levels in Olivia's apartment.
But the ability came with a harmful side effect.
Every time he astral projected, he would create a distortion in the magnetic field and attract metal objects to him.
Even if you're right, what does that have to do with me?
I mean, like you said, it was 25 years ago.
Belly always theorized that the cortexiphan children would share a psychic link, a deep emotional bond because of their shared experience.
Maybe this person is trying to reach out to you, and the harmful side effects are unintentional.
But why me, and why now?
I can't answer that.
But I can say that...
Some of the children didn't handle the treatments as well as you did.
Some had adverse reactions...
Emotionally.
You were always the strongest.
The others recognized that.
You were always their favorite.
It burned you by touching you.
It trapped you in a room.
Who's to say what will happen next time?
We have to find him before he does more damage.
So what was his name?
I remember!
He was subject 9.
Nanotechnology-- The bloom is not off the rose.
Because of the far-ranging claims that have been made about potential applications of nanotechnology, a number of serious concerns have been raised about how this will affect our society if realized and what actions, if any are deemed appropriate,
might be needed to mitigate these risks.
This is not Massive Dynamic's concern.
We create technology.
How it is used is not our concern.
We just own the patents.
The cortexiphan files were sealed for 20 years.
I'm not even sure if all of them still exist.
The files were lost, so to speak.
We never destroyed files!
Maybe she did.
Viper!
Don't make me turn you off.
Well, tell her what I said.
Ask her why she destroyed files.
Go on, ask her!
Maybe you can ask Walter if he remembers what group the boy was in.
I mean, that may help.
Of course.
Walter, did you hear that?
Yes.
Her voice goes right into my inner ear and rattled around like razor blades.
Of course I heard it.
Tell her to go--
He said that he is not sure, but thank you for the suggestion.
I did not say that!
Walter has said many things to me over the years, but "thank you" was never one of them.
A word, Olivia?
I'll see you in there.
So you told me about the fringe event, but I think you left something out.
It's happening to you, isn't it?
Now, come on.
I haven't seen this much fear in your face since Bobby Hastings asked you to the prom.
So what can I do to help you, dear?
You've done it.
Walter thinks he knows how to deal with it.
We just need to find the file.
So what were these trials all about, anyway?
Walter and William Bell thought that children had untapped extrasensory capabilities--
Capabilities that are socialized out of us when we grow up.
They wanted to tap into those abilities--
Things like telekinesis, pyrokinesis, even the ability to cross over to another universe without a bridge.
And so they...
Experimented on kids.
Yeah.
What happened to the program?
I left.
I ran away.
Walter said he and Bell shut it down a few years after that.
Here he is.
His name's Cameron James.
Walter, what are you doing?
Going with Agent Dunham, of course.
Now that we know who he is and where we have to go to find him.
Walter, you haven't left the lab in three years.
You could be killed.
I know the patient.
I know his capabilities.
You do not.
You need me.
Without me, you can do nothing.
Claire, will you please man the cameras in my absence?
Really, Claire?
That doesn't even start with an "A."
If you don't mind,
I think I should urinate before we leave.
Don't worry.
I've packed us sandwiches.
Oh!
- You okay?
- Yes.
Perfectly fine.
Peachy.
You got a problem?
Fresh air...
I'd forgotten how much I love it.
Ah!
I should've gotten out of the lab years ago.
It must be nearly 6:00.
I suppose we could wait for him to get home, or perhaps some of the neighbors know where he works.
Can we do that?
Do what?
We got here, and the door was unlocked.
Splendid.
Hello?
We're in the wrong place.
All this mail is addressed to Mark Little.
Cameron James must have moved on.
No.
He still lives here.
Look around.
There's no metal anywhere.
He's even changed the light fixtures.
Hey.
Who are you?
What are you doing in here?
Agent Dunham.
FBI.
Oh.
We're looking for a Mark Little.
You wouldn't happen to know where we could find him?
Is he-
- Is he in trouble?
He looked like the sort who could get into all sorts of trouble.
We're not sure.
That's why we wanted to ask him some questions.
I'm Walter Bishop.
It's nice to meet you.
Mark-
- Uh, he won't be back till tomorrow morning.
He drives a supply truck for a furniture company back and forth to Maine.
At least that's what he says he does.
You never can tell with people.
So tomorrow morning-- You're sure?
Yeah.
He's usually back by 10:00.
Thank you.
$200 a night.
Look at this room.
It's a veritable petri dish.
I can't imagine what I would see with a black light.
Or worse, I can imagine.
Here.
It also controls the temperature and the lights.
And-
- And this is for the tv.
Of course, if Belly were still here, he'd be delighted.
You know, he and I used to argue about this.
At what point does technology outpace its usefulness?
Walter, I'm gonna try and get some sleep.
Can I get you anything before I go?
Perhaps a glass of water?
Do you have any idea how many viruses a simple water glass can carry?
Okay.
Well, if you need me, I'm right next door.
Walter.
Walter!
Walter, it's me.
I'm coming in.
Aah!
Hair follicles on the bedspread, dead skin cells on the pillow, chocolate stains on the desk and strawberry juice on the carpet--
Not to mention bodily fluids,
- seminal stains and phlegm...
- Walter, its okay.
And urine on the carpet!
Don't you realize the harm these pathogens can provoke?
- I tried to ignore that.
- Walter...
- I tried to ignore that!
- Walter!
There is nothing here that can hurt you.
This is all in your mind.
I'm sorry.
Does that hurt?
Not as deeply as my pride.
Mysophobia...
I haven't had an attack in years.
It's curious, don't you think?
The things that we see, that we investigate, and you don't bat an eye, and some harmless germs make you shake in your boots.
I suppose it is.
Elizabeth, my wife, used to say I was a man of contradictions.
She liked that about me.
I liked everything about her.
She committed suicide.
Did you know that?
After our Peter died.
I'm glad she never knew me like this...
Afraid of things I can't even see.
Walter, I don't think
I'm gonna get much sleep tonight either.
What do you say to a root beer float?
No, no.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
Let me show you how.
You take the straw out of the glass, thusly.
Then stab the ice cream...
Push the straw down to the root beer at the bottom, and then you suck up the ice cream and the soda simultaneously to deliver the perfect blend of sugary goodness, like so.
Mmm, Mmm.
Ahh.
Better?
Better.
Mmm.
"Does he pose a significant threat to himself or others?"
Hmm?
The letter in your jacket from St. Claire's.
I wasn't snooping.
I-I saw the emblem.
Well, perhaps I was snooping a bit.
I'm sorry.
You weren't supposed to see that.
It's all right.
I've known for three years that this day would come sooner or later, that I was a burden to Fringe Division and to you.
Walter--
No need to sugarcoat it.
I've never had any illusions about the nature of this relationship--
Of our relationship.
I merely work for you.
We're not family.
If I should cease to be useful, if my behaviors are outweighing my value, well...
That's why you left the lab, isn't it, Walter...
To prove that you're capable?
I suppose tonight hasn't been my strongest showing.
I need you to understand that...
Whatever decision I make,
I'm only trying to do what's best.
What's best for whom, Agent Dunham?
Oh, dear.
Olivia!
Thank you.
Lieutenant Daniels?
Special Agent Olivia Dunham.
You're the fed who's been pulling rank on my officers.
I got eyewitnesses reporting something that nobody seems to be able to explain.
I got a federal agent firing shots in public-
- That's you.
I got a car that ran into a wall of blinding light.
You want to tell me what the hell's going on here, agent?
I don't know either.
But like I told your officers, I can handle it from here.
So we're gonna need the case files, witness statements, and also the security footage from above the cash register.
Before we discuss the handling of evidence, you're gonna have to explain to me exactly what your jurisdiction is here.
I think that this is all you'll need.
The name at the top is my division chief,
Phillip Broyles, and below that, his boss.
I'm sure that you'll recognize that name.
Blanket authority.
There you go.
I tried to give him some soup, but he said he wasn't interested.
Thank you.
We should go now.
I want to be at Cameron James' apartment before he gets home.
This is because of what I did to all of you.
This is because of me.
It's an indisputable fact.
If I hadn't experimented with cortexiphan, then none of this would be happening.
37 innocent children, and I just turned you into numbers, numbers in my head.
I didn't follow up on a single child-
- Not even you.
Hey, Walter, you said before that the doses were so low, none of the children's abilities lasted any longer
- than 24 hours after treatment.
- That's true.
We couldn't have accounted for this.
But if-
- If Cameron is manifesting astral projection, then it must be inadvertent, which means that he may not even be aware of the damage he's creating.
Oh, no.
This is purposeful.
I can feel it.
Okay.
Walter, here.
Alone?
Walter.
May I borrow your cell phone?
I need to call Agent Farnsworth...
To check on my project.
Thank you.
Mark Little?
Yeah.
Olivia Dunham, FBI.
I was wondering if I could ask you a few questions.
Um, sure.
Anything you need.
What's going on?
Well, I'm actually looking for a man named Cameron James.
I was-
- Hey!
Cameron!
Stop, Cameron!
Oh!
Cameron?
Aah!
- Why?
- Who are you?
Why are you coming after me?
- What do you want from me?
- What's he doing here?
- What do you want?
- What do you want from me?
- Leave me alone!
- Olivia, please don't kill him.
Olive?
Don't you lie to me.
Why are you doing this to me?
I don't know what you're talking about.
I haven't thought about you in years.
Olive.
Man, look at you.
You're okay.
No, no, no.
The elevator, the lights.
You're able to astral project.
Listen, Dr. Freak,
I haven't been able to astral project since you stopped shoving needles in my arm when I was seven years old!
Now, all I have are the bad side effects!
Anytime I have any kind of anxiety, I send metal flying.
So I have to stay calm.
That's the funny thing about life.
It's not always calm, you know?
You want to hear about my last date?
I take a girl for something to eat.
I say something stupid.
I see she saw I said something stupid.
Suddenly, all the metal fillings are being pulled out of her mouth.
So thanks for that.
Why did you change your name?
What are you hiding from?
If I was hiding, I would've moved.
Cameron James was my father's name.
He was the one who signed me up for those experiments, made me use his name so he could access that pathetic trust fund they gave us.
He took money from you so you could pump me full of drugs, then turned around and spent it on drugs himself.
Hell of a guy.
I don't know what kind of father does that.
Not one I want to share a name with.
You realize just what you did to me?
If you had given me some special power, that'd be one thing.
Maybe I'd be special.
Or at least I'd be useful.
Or if you'd just left me alone,
I could have been normal, have a normal life with normal friends.
Instead, I'm neither.
I'm just a freak.
Can you understand what that's like?
I'm afraid I can.
I'm sorry.
I never meant to harm you.
I have nothing to do with this!
No!
You stopped it.
Walter, if he isn't doing this, what is?
Walter...
You have to think of something.
I can't.
There's nothing.
Well, if it isn't Cameron, then what is it?
And why is it coming after me?
I don't know.
You don't know?
Or are you just afraid to tell us?
You think I wouldn't tell you?
You're not at all like I remember you.
What happened to you?
Walter...
You must be able to think of something.
It is possible that the electromagnetism isn't the root cause but a side effect of field distortions in time.
In time?
Yes.
What we consider to be linear time.
Now, that would explain the video in the lab.
I witnessed effect before cause.
If Cameron's reflexive magnetic discharge dispersed the energy event, then this thing, whatever it is, does not create magnetic fields.
It-
- It-
- It distorts those that already exist around us, focusing them, maybe tearing them open...
Okay.
And I'm afraid it's going to keep returning until it's demolished, growing so large that it will consume everything in its path.
Okay.
So how do we stop it?
Well, we gather together a large enough field of energy to neutralize the electromagnetism.
In theory, it should shatter it.
Okay.
So how do we do that?
We can't.
Only he can.
You have the ability to gather and direct the kind of power we need.
- How?
- You just did it in the hallway.
Once when you were a boy, you blew up a toaster oven with your mind simply because of an irrational hatred of raisin toast.
- Have you ever had raising toast?
- I know.
I was not correct that your abilities faded over time, but I am certain that their utility is based on your ability to focus your emotions.
It's like the toaster oven, but on a grand scale.
Thanks, Astrid.
Okay.
There's a power grid terminal on the West Side.
What do we do now?
For whatever reason, the force seems to be drawn to Agent Dunham.
So now we wait.
When it attacks her again, you will combine your energy with the energy of the power grid to destroy it.
Have you heard about any of the others?
No.
Have you?
You're the first.
I used to wonder about them a lot.
Less so now, I guess.
You haven't had any side effects from the experiments?
You're really lucky.
Or it's something else.
What are you saying?
When I had my first experience,
I thought something was coming after me, too...
Until I realized I was doing it to myself.
You think I'm doing this...
That I'm bringing this on myself?
I don't know.
The question is, would he tell you if he thought you were?
You weren't there anymore.
But I remember he wasn't happy when the experiments stopped.
It's happening.
It's happening!
It's happening!
Now, Cameron!
This isn't me.
I am not doing this.
Do it, Cameron!
Direct it at the wall!
Good!
That's it!
Disperse the energy!
Now, Cameron, before it's too late!
You.
Yes!
That's it!
It's working!
Stronger!
Come on, destroy it!
Cameron, stop.
Cameron.
Stop, Cameron!
Olivia, what are you doing?
Cameron!
I'm telling you, Walter, I was not seeing things.
- You're telling me it was him, the man?
- Yes.
The man I was seeing in the lab?
The man you've been seeing in your dreams?
Then why did you try to stop Cameron from destroying it?
I don't know.
I can't explain it.
I just had a feeling that-
- That...
That he didn't want to hurt me, that he wanted my help.
You know, Cameron, if there's anything that I can do for you...
Make him forget about me.
Walter...
Do you think we destroyed it?
Do you think it's gone?
I can't be sure, Olivia.
What you did may have compromised Cameron's ability.
He may have just displaced it.
You acted against all reasonable agreements and expectations.
You behaved irrationally with regard to only your intuition and instincts.
I guess I did.
When I do that, people say I'm crazy.
I suppose I've learned that crazy is a lot more complicated than people think.
Dunham.
I just received a disturbing call.
A father and son just pulled a man from the middle of Reiden Lake.
Where's Reiden Lake?
Upstate New York.
Details are sketchy, but apparently whoever he is knows a lot of classified information--
Things no one outside this division could possibly know.
What's more...
He claims to know every one of us.
I had a house at Reiden Lake.
Sorry I kept you waiting so long.
Phillip Broyles-- We spoke on the phone.
He's stabilized.
Vitals are good.
- Has he said anything else?
- No.
But he keeps talking about an Olivia Dunham.
That's me.
Can you take me to him?
Follow me.
Excuse me, doctor.
Olivia.
Thank God you're here.
Who are you?
This story is inspired by a true Thai ritual, "Non Long Sadohkroh" which literally means:
"Lie in Coffin, to rid of bad luck and prolong life."
This is perhaps as close as anyone can get to death.
I lie in the Coffin... whilst rites are being performed.
But I am not dead!
This is a typical custom participation that only happens in Thailand.
To bluff the god of death... to dispel bad fortunes.
Difficult for lots of people to believe.
But I believe... and I'm not the only one!
Today, in a Thai province, thousands gather for a strange ceremony.
To lie in a coffin to rid one of bad fortunes.
Bullshit!
After the coffin ceremony...
I can feel the bad luck, leaving my body, and... when I left the coffin,
I feel that life has a new meaning.
My daughter was in coma.
I wrote her name on a piece of paper, and with it I prayed for her in the coffin.
She awoke after a week even doctors call it a miracle.
My mother had stomach cancer, we tried all types of cure to no avail.
That is why I brought her here.
She will become better after it.
Tens of thousands attend it over the 3 days, making it the world's largest live burial and Guinness record.
When are you coming back to Hong Kong?
Everyone is panicking!
They can't have a wedding without the bride!
Everyone please come this way and choose your coffin!
Don't worry, everyone will get it.
Who want to donate a coffin, please come this way.
Any of your bad luck will be gone!
And the coffins we use today are brand new...
Please free your mind, and think about the principle of Buddhism.
Lay down...
Turn your head to the West where the sun sets... and listen to the monks preaching about death.
Now, I'd like to inform once again to the team workers:
Please do not touch the coffin...
Cause it'll bring bad omens to the person lying inside.
'Mariko'
'Mariko'
Close your eyes... and now open it.
You don't like it?
How do you draw it with such piercing eyes...
It's seductive.
This is the beauty of it!
One...
Two...
Three... contact!
There's no pulse?
And no blood pressure.
Contact!
His pulse is back... below 98.
How long did his heart stopped?
6 minutes 42 seconds...
- You sure?
- Sure.
What happened?
Why am I here?
You became sick during the ceremony.
You lost your heartbeat, so we bring you to the hospital.
But you seem alright now.
The burial ceremony?
Please stay calm.
Don't get up now...
Please don't get up now...
Jack is very stressed!
He thinks you've changed your mind.
Have you?
Don't be a runaway bride please.
Wedding is next week!
Call me!
Are you feeling better now?
Almost.
You look like you're half dead.
How do you know I am here?
In a emergency situation like this, they always call your dear friends.
You must have checked my phone contacts?
Don't be too cleaver when you are sick.
How do you feel?
I am okay.
What did the doctor say?
Very serious depression disorder, resulting in serious illusions, and mental disorder.
The last part, I added myself.
I never knew you believe in the coffin ceremony.
Is it because of Mariko?
I did what I had to do... after all, I got nothing to lose.
Think of yourself, don't do it again.
Unless... there are pretty attendants.
I'll have them warm you something to eat, and get you an injection as well.
Mike?
Your dinner's been heated up.
Are you okay?
Sue, come and help me.
Do I look like a bridegroom?
Even your tie is not properly done!
That's why you're marrying me.
To help you with your neck tie?
Done.
Why did you agree to marry me?
No idea, maybe I was drunk!
Come on, give me a good reason.
Cause your dad is very rich.
That's not a good reason.
Cause you're good in bed.
Even worse reason.
Cause you need somebody to take care of.
Sue, how are you, you got me worried.
Nan, how come you're here?
They contacted me in school.
They found my card in your purse.
Why didn't you tell me you were in Thailand?
Sorry, it was a last minute decision.
Sue, I understand you very well.
You never make rash decisions.
Hello doctor.
Hello
Miss Wong, how do you feel?
It still hurts a little.
You are very lucky.
We were worried you would have broken bones, piercing your vital organs.
I have seen all the x-ray's.
Nothing wrong at all.
It's just some external cuts, nothing to worry.
Anyway, it doesn't matter.
What do you mean?
Did you not see the cancer tumors on the x-ray's?
You have cancer?
Nothing of that sort, Miss Wong.
First, let's have you get some rest, okay?
Sue, I don't understand.
What is really happening?
Why didn't you tell me?
What happened to this patient?
Oh, we transfer her to room 406, she awaken last night.
It is at the end of the hallway.
Thank you...
Make yourself at home.
Thank you so much.
I can't believe the cancer's gone.
I don't know, will the tumors resurface tomorrow?
It won't happen.
Remember, you were always lucky.
You should go back to Hong Kong, and get happily married.
Okay then.
I'll book a ticket for tomorrow's flight.
Thank you.
Jack!
Jack!
I'm so glad your here.
When did you arrive?
Sorry, I should have told you.
Did Nan call you?
I missed you so much.
I know... same with me.
Joanne, what's up?
I'm alright.
Don't worry about me, Jack's here.
Everything's well, I'll tell...
What nonsense are you babbling about?
He's right here beside me, and he's fine.
You know what...
I will call you back later, okay?
Anything wrong?
No.
Wait a moment, I need to go and see Nan.
Sorry.
Joanne just called.
Sue...
Jack was in an accident.
He's dead.
I'm so sorry.
Jack is in the sleeping-room.
There is nobody in that room!
Sue what is wrong, there's nobody in that room, right?
Yes, nobody.
I thought I going to lose you.
I am here... alive and well.
It's so beautiful over here.
We can have our honeymoon here.
Honeymoon?
Sorry...
I thought we could have!
No...
You did not.
You mean?
I agree.
You're sure?
You mean you are not sure?
I am, only that...
You said I can continue painting in Thailand.
Don't worry, I won't fall into coma again.
You can have it anytime you want.
That is not what I meant.
Thank you for always taking care of me.
It's getting cold, lets go inside.
No, I want to see the sunrise.
Okay, I'll go bring some clothes.
Thank you.
Mariko?
Mariko!
What happened?
What's wrong with you...
Mariko...
I'm here with you.
'Jack'
Is she well?
Still not stable.
I need to spent time by her side.
You know what Chris...
we come empty to this world, and we will leave empty.
It is the same woman.
What?
The woman I saw...
Is the same who Mariko saw.
How is that possible?
I also don't understand.
Do you know who she is?
Maybe the coffin you laid in was hers.
Not possible,
The coffins were new.
You sure they used new ones?
Thai Temples / North East Thailand
'Wat Dhammajakdaram'
Professor Tananchai, thank you for meeting with us.
It is my pleasure.
I'm sorry to hear about your fiance's death.
Thank you.
Professor Tananchai is doing research, on unusual events after the coffin ceremonies.
I am not an expert.
I became personally interested, after the death of my best friend.
Why did he die?
This was taken less than 1 hour before his drowning.
We went for excursion after our graduation.
We raced to see who could reach the shore first, trying to impress the girls.
He was chasing after me... and tried to pass me.
Suddenly he disappeared.
Joe?
Joe!
At Joe's funeral ceremony, only his mother did not shed a tear.
After his cremation... she told us the real reason why she didn't cry.
I cause the death of my son.
I found out I had stomach cancer.
But I didn't tell anyone in my family.
I didn't want to worry them.
The doctor said it was terminal, and I don't have long to live.
Later someone told me... about the coffin ceremony.
I didn't believe in these things.
But then I thought, why not?
That is when I went to the ceremony.
When death is right in front of you... you try to evade it.
After the coffin ceremony,
I did not feel any difference.
But the doctor told me... my stomach cancer is gone.
How do you explain, this and Joe's death...
Is there any relation?
Joe died on the same day that the doctor told me the news.
The doctor told me... that my cancer is gone.
You have to know... you cannot escape retribution and bad luck.
You can only pass it on to your loved ones.
Please mommy, everything is fine now!
Did you see that?
See what?
Just a view seconds back.
'Wat Dhammajakdaram'
Hush my baby and do not cry...
May!
Baby!
Baby!
My baby!
Give me back my child!
Give me back my child...
Hey, are you alright?
Have you been able to determine if there is any connection to what's currently happening?
I have collected a lot of information, about current cases, recording what has really happened.
Surachai.
Chuchart... 43 years old, went to the coffin ceremony with cancer... on 17 July 2004.
By amazing good fortune she was cured 1 week later.
She would have die if nothing miraculous occurred.
Sukhontha Glin-ngam... 67 years old, went to coffin ceremony on 27 April 2001.
A few days later, his heart problem improved.
But at the same time, his grand daughter got seriously injured!
Did anybody encountered supernatural happening's after the ceremonial?
That happened only once!
About 5 years ago.
But I cannot reveal too much about this case, unless someone has experienced it before.
Hey...
Why did you go into forbidden area?
I saw a woman entering the area.
No females are kept in here!
So it must be a lady ghost!
Why do you look so pale?
Nothing... nothing of importance.
How long have you been an undertaker?
Even before you were born!
Taking care of the dead... makes me treasure my life.
How many bodies have you cremated?
3248 including the one inside.
Did you cremate a woman and child recently?
I've booked a flight for tomorrow to Hong Kong for you.
Thank you.
Do you remember the old school days?
I dried your hair... slept in the same room.
Ate instant noodles together.
And wore the same clothes.
Skipped classes together.
Even fell for the same guy!
I'm so sorry Sue, I said too much.
Never mind.
What I meant was... my dad died of liver cancer.
I don't want to die the same way.
I ate proper meals... took care of my health.
I exercise everyday... follow the rules of good health.
You are very well now.
Right... but I wish Jack was here.
Jack is dead.
He died because of me.
Don't say that.
I was thinking while I laid inside the coffin... why is it not Jack!
He smokes cigarettes everyday.
Why is it not Jack?
It is not fair.
I am sorry to him.
It's okay now.
It's okay now.
Let it be.
Tomorrow I'll go to Hong Kong with you.
Thank you.
With pleasure!
I'm just going to get dressed.
You can take whatever you want from the dresser.
What do you want from me?
Tell me, what do you really want?
What do you want me to do?
I want to go and see professor Tananchai again.
All right, all right.
Chris!
'Wat Dhammajakdaram'
I've cremated a lot of bodies... never met with anything unusual.
None we could not burn.
But there still are some preparation problems.
Like the burial door that is stuck, and the burner could not lit.
Or the coffin kept shifting.
Then we bury them here.
They should be waiting for you.
Chris!
Chris...
Chris!
Chris...
No!
Chris?
Chris?
Chris!
Chris.
Chris?
No!
Chris!
Mariko?
Mariko!
Mariko?
Okay... okay.
What should I do now?
You lie in the coffin once more.
It's because of death that you're able to live.
You shouldn't wait until a loved one's death, to realize your own life.
Death is not death, it is actually life.
Death before dying, is death that will never die.
Hello
How are you, Chris?
I am well.
This is Nan.
- Hello.
- Hi.
And that's Sue.
Professor Tananchai told me about your problems.
My condolences.
Chris, why is this happening?
Life continually revolves nonstop... but, was broken by us.
How do we resolve it?
I haven't done anything.
That night I found May's body...
Mariko fell into coma.
She's been in coma since!
She died 5 years ago.
Sorry, I did not know about it.
It's all right.
Both my parents died when I was young.
Thinking of my loved ones leaving me, makes me feel more miserable than death itself.
My apologies...
I could not help you much.
You have been a great help.
I am sorry May.
If I had known I will harm the both of you.
I would not have joined the coffin ceremony.
It's not Mariko's fault.
He could have been a good man.
When I got home... the house was on fire.
I wanted to save him.
But I failed to do.
You left me because of him?
If he was your child,
I would have stayed behind.
I am sorry.
Chris...
I'm going to miss you.
The same with me.
I have to leave now.
Will we meet again?
My cancer has returned.
After the second coffin ceremony, my cancer returned... and...
I did not see Jack again.
I have been under chemotherapy for some time now.
It has been unbearable... but life keeps revolving.
I will not try to stop it again.
Do I look like your bridegroom?
human beings closest encounter before death
I lie in the Coffin whilst rites are being performed but I am not dead this is a Thai custom to bluff the god of death to dispel bad fortunes difficult for lots of people to believe but I believe and not only me alone

After the coffin ceremony
I can feel the bad luck leaving mine body

My daughter was in coma
I wrote her name on paper and prayed in the coffin with it

Unusual happenings with their coffin ceremony
I am not an expert
Every one have his curiousity why did he die
this was taken less than 1 hour before his drowning we went for excursion after our graduation we raced to see who could reach the shore first trying to impress the girls
he was chasing after me
suddenly he disappeared
at Joe's funeral ceremony only his mother did not shed a tear after his cremation she told us the real reason
I cause the death of my son
I had stomach cancer but I never mentioned to anyone
I don't want him to worry the doctor said it was terminal it was terminal and I don't have long to live later,someone told me about the coffin ceremony
I don't belief in these things but then I thought, why not?
that is when I went to the ceremony when death is right in front of you
you try to evade it after the coffin ceremony
I did not feel any difference but the doctor told me
my stomach cancer is gone how do you explain this and Joe's death is there a relationship to it?
because on the day of Joe's death the doctor told me this news that my cancer is gone
do you know?
you cannot escape retribution and bad luck
you can only pass it on to your loved ones
auntie, are you better?
did you see it?
see what?

apologies
I could not help you much you have been a great help
I am sorry, May
If I had known I will harm the both of you
I would not have joined the coffin ceremony
It's not Mariko's fault
he could have been a good man
when I got home
the house was on fire
I wanted to save him

If he is your child

After the second coffin ceremony, my cancer returned and I did not see Jack again
I have been under therapy for some time now it has been unbearable

English subtitle prepared by Pinedovski
human beings closest encounter before death
I lie in the Coffin whilst rites are being performed but I am not dead this is a Thai custom to bluff the god of death to dispel bad fortunes difficult for lots of people to believe but I believe and not only me alone
today,in a thai province,thousands gather for a strange ceremony to lie in a coffin to rid one of bad fortunes bullshit
After the coffin ceremony
I can feel the bad luck leaving mine body
when I leave the coffin
I feel that life has a new meaning
My daughter was in coma
I wrote her name on paper and prayed in the coffin with it
She woke after a week even doctors call it a miracle my mother had stomach cancer we tried all types of cure to no avail that is why I brought her here she will become better after it tens of thousands attend it over the 3 days
making it the world's biggest live burial and Guiness record

Ah Chan, thank you for meeting with us
It is my pleasure
I'm sorry to hear about your fiance's death thank you
Unusual happenings with their coffin ceremony
I am not an expert
Every one have his curiousity why did he die
this was taken less than 1 hour before his drowning we went for excursion after our graduation we raced to see who could reach the shore first trying to impress the girls
he was chasing after me
suddenly he disappeared
at Joe's funeral ceremony only his mother did not shed a tear after his cremation she told us the real reason
I cause the death of my son
I had stomach cancer but I never mentioned to anyone
I don't want him to worry the doctor said it was terminal it was terminal and I don't have long to live later,someone told me about the coffin ceremony
I don't belief in these things but then I thought, why not?
that is when I went to the ceremony when death is right in front of you
you try to evade it after the coffin ceremony
I did not feel any difference but the doctor told me
my stomach cancer is gone how do you explain this and Joe's death is there a relationship to it?
because on the day of Joe's death the doctor told me this news that my cancer is gone
do you know?
you cannot escape retribution and bad luck
you can only pass it on to your loved ones
auntie, are you better?
did you see it?
see what?

#Good morning, U.S.A. #
# I got a feeling that it's gonna be a wonderful day #
#The sun in the sky has a smile on his face #
# And he's shining a salute to the American race #
# Oh, boy it's swell to say #
# Good morning, U.S.A. #
[ Chorus ] # Good morning, U.S.A. ##
- Hey, have a little coffee with your sugar.
- Mm-hmm.
Oh, come on!
You used to think that was funny!
Yes, honey.
The first thousand times you said it.
You need to get some new material.
Maybe you need to forget my old material!
Jackson thinks it's funny, and he knew about Wanda Sykes before anybody.
Okay.
Your dinners are in the fridge.
I'll be at my parents all week while Bah-Bah recovers from his hernia operation.
Mostly I'll be pressing down on his abdomen to release gas, or ""fart him."
I wish I could go with you, Francine, but I have to work.
You know, got to protect the country.
Please.
I've been to your work.
You bowl oranges at plastic cups and google people you went to high school with.
That's how I found out that Rebecca Green is a real estate agent in Chimdale!
I came this close to not knowing that.
Francine, you're not looking at my fingers.
Look how close they are together.
Damn, those sons of bitches are close.
Today's the first day of spring break, friends.
[ All ] Yea!
And we're finally gonna lose... our fear of college-level number theory!
- [ Gasps ] we're not ready!
- Grow up!
Man, your suitcase is heavy!
Is what someone less buff than myself would say.
- Feel my muscle!
- when I get back.
- [ Engine Starts ] - [ Kisses ]
Aah!
Oh!
My foot!
You ran over my foot!
Nothing?
.
You used to love the crushed-foot bit.
I'll see you on Thursday.
- Francine, wait!
- [Tires Screech ]
- Do you think I'm pretty?
.
- Stan, I'm late.
why aren't you taking Stan?
.
Did he do something?
.
Say you'll buy her jewelry.
He'll buy you jewelry!
Jewelry!
what, are you crazy?
.
On your salary?
.
I'm not going with her, Roger.
Not that she really cares.
Hmm.
Say, wouldn't you rather have this conversation with yourself in a motel?
.
The place off the freeway is nice.
I guess after 20 years of marriage, Francine is bored with me.
She's heard all my jokes, all my stories.
Francine hates you.
You should kill yourself in the motel off the freeway.
- Are you trying to get rid of me?
.
- That's ridiculous!
why would I want to get rid of you?
.
I love you!
Let's have sex!
Go wait for me in the motel off the freeway.
Oh, too late.
Here we go.
welcome, Rutgers, to Spring Break '08!
- [ Cheering ]
- Get your goody bags.
Inside are wristbands- red for cabanas, blue for the beer line.
- what's this?
.
- why, it's a butt plug, young man.
Yeah!
Roger, what the hell is going on?
.
Last year I was watching MTV's Spring Break with Carmen Selectra.
She was at a house in Cabo talking to this total idiot.
""King of spring break, ' they called him.
""Wildest spring break ever" they said.
And I'm thinking, "" He's king?
He's king?
That spring break sucks!
I could throw a better spring break than that loser!"
I'm Scotch Bingelngton, the true king of spring break!
My scepter shoots Chivas!
And this end dispenses Ludens cough drops.
I'm fighting something.
You're having spring break in my house?
.
Yup.
I put up a web site, cold-called some schools.
Rutgers is here.
A bus from Georgetown is coming.
Central Virginia State.
Yes, it's a real school.
You've read about them.
Their mascot allegedly raped that stripper.
Remember?
.
He stayed in his costume the whole time, never took his head off?
.
She's lying.
- ## [Rock] - [ Chattering ]
You did this in the time it took me to walk Francine to the car?
.
Get to know me, Stan.
I'm amazing.
- I'm wasted!
- I'm so drunk.
I want to do everything with anybody!
- Oh, yeah!
I'm gonna hit that.
- I'm gonna tear that up!
I'm gonna kill her with a bottle!
Here's the margarita waterfall.
Over there's the lazy river of beer.
Oh, and here's a giant tiki statue that cries booze.
Five tears will have you on your ass.
Ten tears will have you on my ass.
Just kidding.
I'm flirting with you.
- what is all this?
.
- Spring break, Hayley.
I'm having spring break in the house.
Catch up.
Oh, my God!
This is perfect!
I just finished my midterms!
I so need to have a good time right now!
- [ Coughing, Gagging ]
- Br
- Breathe through your nose.
Breathe through your nose!
There you go.
You're doing it, my good-time gal.
- Roger, there's no way you're having spring break here!
- Mmm!
Everyone, get out right now!
Come on!
Let's go!
Party's over!
- Hey, have a little hot dog with your ketchup.
- [ Giggling ]
Little hot dog with your-
You're funny!
Are you a comedian?
.
No.
I mean
- I mean, I am funny, but I work for the C.I.A.
[ Squeals ] Oh, my God!
Tracy!
- He works for the C.I.A.!
- whatever.
In world war II they were called the O.S.S. Let's go!
Oh, that's so awesome.
You, like, protect the country and noise.
You're a total hero.
Nah.
It
- It can be pretty dangerous though.
I have to be in good shape.
[ Groans ] Yeah.
Can I feel your muscle?
.
Oh, can I pretend I'm a monkey and hang off your arm?
.
- Uh- - [ Screeching ]
Thanks.
[ Chuckles ]
- I'm Jessica.
- I'm Stan.
Are you here for spring break?
.
Yes.
Yes, I am.
Oh, good.
You're on board.

But when you say Mesa, people don't know what Mesa is.
Uh
- I mean, i-it's Phoenix.
I lived in Phoenix.
Scotch Bingeington, this is the greatest spring break ever!
Oh, honey.
Of course you think that.
No, we haven't achieved greatness yet, but we're gettin' there.
Hey, fatso!
Get your dong out of the margarita machine!
Look, just tell your mom you want to switch majors.
She'll be mad, but soon she'll realize there's worse things... than having a broadcast journalist in the family.
wow.
You are, like, superwise.
You're interesting, you're funny, and you're pretty.
I knew it!
Look, Jessica.
- I should tell you, I'm seeing someone.

But that doesn't mean we can't be spring break buddies.

[ Cheering, Chattering ]
Phew!
Do not go on the beach volleyball court.
You hit that thing with a black light, it's gonna glow like a bedspread at Harrah's.
That's fine.
I'll just stay here and be a responsible adult... while my husband's run off to live in a fantasy world with Miss Laughy Pants.
Good!
Have a nice life.
what the- who's the prom queen who can only handle half a Cider Jack?
.
[ Doorbell Rings ]
Hi.
Is, uh- Is Jessica Raplansky here?
.
I'm sorry.
She's not.
[ Gasps ] Are you one other father's war buddies?
.
Are you here to take us for Mexican food?
.
Mexican food?
.
I'll get my jacket!
No.
No, no, no.
I'm Stan, her spring break buddy.
Do you know where I can find her?
.
She has Psych 1 01 at Boyden Hall this afternoon.
You could try that.
- Oh, my God!
I'm so excited!
- Can I get flan?
.
You think if I say ""no beans," they'll give me double rice?
.
That's what I'm gonna ask for!
You know, Steve, I've been thinking about what you said.
And...
I'll do it.
I'll take your virginity.
Oh, that's wonderful news.
As you can see, my bed is also a race car.
My medical records.
I'm free of all diseases.
Polio, mumps, whooping cough.
Oh, yeah.
Right.
No.
Okay.
Now, if you'll just call your doctor and have him fax over your medical history... we can get down to bidness.
I'm willing to have sex with you... and you're not gonna put out until you see my medical records?
.
Nowadays you can't be too safe... what with all the wang-shriveling sex diseases... my mom tells me about during bath time.
[ Rings ]
- Hello?
.
- Call me back!
- [ Sighs ] - [ Phone Beeping ]
Long distance expensive.
So, what's going on?
.
You see that Mary-Louise Parker movie on Lifetime?
.
- They cut her breast off.
- Mah-Mah, Stan left me.
[ Gasps ] what?
.
He went off to chase some 1 9-year-old college student... just because I didn't laugh at his stupid coffee joke he's told a thousand times!
wow.
Stan leave you.
- He right!
If I him, I leave you too!
- what?
.
You know how many times Bah-Bah tell the pull-my-finger joke?
.
Four times a week, every week.
And we've been married 50 years!
And it never funny.
Not once.
It got a little funny about 1 0 years ago because it hadn't been funny for so long.
But that was only for, like, two days.
I remember that.
we all went to the lake.
But every time he tell that joke, I laugh... because it make him feel good.
You laugh at his stupid jokes.
He tell you your bad dinner taste good.
- That what marriage is.
- [ Phone Beeps ]
Hold on.
I have another call.
Hello?
.
Hey, Frannie, some guy's pretending to boff your garden gnome.
He's getting some laughs, but it's a little disrespectful. what should I do?
.
And causing us to determine that the behavior's based on a conditioned resp-

Drums ]
Stan?
. what are you doing here?
.
- I came to be with you.
Hi, Tracy!
- Eww!
why's Tracy being such a bitch to me?
.
Stan, you shouldn't have come here.
Look, Jess, I had such a good time at spring break... and I don't want that feeling to end.
Come on!
Eat my algae!
Climb me like a monkey!
Stan!
Are you crazy?
.
That was spring break.
It wasn't real.
Are you trying to tell me this wasn't real?
.
I don't even remember taking this, okay?
.
Just- [ Grunts ] leave me alone.
Go home.
what are you smiling about, Tracy?
.
You still don't got a boyfriend!
Mmm.
Mmm.
My doctor faxed it over.
Some of the pages are faint.
You're low on toner.
I want your virginity, Steve!
I don't know why.
- Maybe because you make me work for it.
- Okay.
Uh, hairline wrist fracture from a surf injury.
wisdom teeth removed without incident.
Yup, clean as a
- Hang on a mo.
Says here you had an elective surgery?
.
Right.
I had my breasts enhanced.
[ Hisses ] Yeah, uh-
Sorry, Carmen.
I can't.
The first boobs I'm with have got to be real.
- Lose the balloons, then give me a call.
- You're joking.
No.
It just sounds like I'm joking 'cause I used the word ""balloons."
Francine?
.
wh-what are you doing here?
.
I came to find you.
Oh, Francine.
I'm so embarrassed about how I acted!
No.
This is my fault too.
Marriage takes work, no matter how long you've been in it.
I'm sorry I haven't been making an effort.
And I'm sorry that girl was the one to make you feel special.
I want to be the one to make you feel that way... always.
- Francine, come on.
- what?
.
Hey, have a little coffee with your sugar.
Mmm.
Oh, don't look.
Don't look.
It's Tracy!
No, no!
No, no!
French me!
- Mmm!
- Oh, hi, Tracy.
Didn't see you there.
I was just making out with my new babe.
She's a senior.
Yeah.
Senior citizen.
Damn!
That bitch's mind works fast!
Hey, y'all!
we've had a blast this week in Langley Falls... thanks to our host, Scotch Bingeington, the new king of spring break!
- I'm sorry, but I can't accept the crown.
- [ Crowd Gasping]
This whole week I've felt like something was missing and I haven't been able to find it.
I threw a good spring break, maybe even a great spring break... but not the best spring break ever.
I failed you and myself!
.
I'm sorry.
[ weeping ] while our producers sort this out, I'd like to make an announcement.
Steve Smith!
I flew my doctor in on my private jet, and I had them removed!
They're all real, baby, so come and get it!
Yeah!
No!
Oh, my God!
She's dead!
Carmen is dead!
Oh!
If only she'd had some sort of cushioning on her chest... something not real!
Fake, if you will, to withstand the impact!
Oh, my God!
That's it.
That's what's been missing.
It's not a real party until somebody dies!
This is the greatest spring break ever!
[ Cheering ]
I am the king!
- [ Party Favor Blows ] - [ Cheering]
Bye!
Have a beautiful time!
- Afternoon.
- Afternoon.
Hey.
Sorry, man.
I'm sorry.
What?
- I'm, like, 10 minutes late.
- Why have you been avoiding me?
I'm sitting right next to you.
How am I avoiding you?
Three days ago, I tell you Father Patrick "Satan" Murphy is alive and well... and retired in Tulsa, and you disappear...
- off the face of the earth- that's how.
- Just been busy.
This morning you called in sick to work.
To stay home and drink?
I had a couple beers.
So what?
Grace, I know you went to see him.
What happened?
- What are you talking about?
- What happened when you went to see Murphy?
- I didn't go see him.
- Well, are you investigating him?
Have you found other victims?
- What are you looking at?
- This guy.
I don't like him.
Nice try.
Will you please talk to me?
Shit.
Hey!
Call 911.
He's got a gun.
Grace, no!
Wait for backup!
Police!
Drop the gun!
Shots fired.
Two down.
An off-duty female officer is in foot pursuit of a carjacking suspect.
Hey!
Shit.
Hey!
- We need to set up a perimeter on this block.
- Right away.
And get the air unit headed this way.
Shooter's a male, white, 35 to 40 years old... 6'2", 210, short blond hair... dark blue jeans, hole in left knee, green plaid shirt... over a long-sleeve white T-shirt, black tennis shoes.
He's got a silver. 38 snub nose, and he runs like a deer.
Get him.
Freeze!
Drop your weapon and put your hands in the air.
Yeah.
I don't give a shit about him.
Get a bus.
We got an officer down.
So pretty and, oh, so bold
Got a heart full of gold on a lonely road
- She said, "I don't even think that God can save me"
- Save me
Am I gaining ground Am I losing face
Have I lost and found my saving grace
Thankful for the gift my angels gave me
We're awfully busy today.
I'm wondering if I might be able to put you in tomorrow?
Right.
It's good to meet you too, Joe.
Yes.
Thank you, sir.
How's Riley?
- It's bad.
- Hey, he survived the fall, right?
- That's one tough dog.
He's gonna make it.
- The kid's gonna be okay.
- The bullet grazed his shoulder.
- The shooter's dead.
The old guy he pistol-whipped got some stitches, but he's gonna be fine.
- We got an I.D. On the shooter?
- Ah-
F.B.I. Tagged the case.
Basically said, "Thanks.
See ya. "
Guy was hinky as hell.
- Yeah.
- How you feelin'?
I should've reacted sooner.
No.
I mean, you called in sick.
Are you okay?
- Yeah.
I'm fine.
I'm fine.
- Yeah?
All right.
Congratulations.
You just knocked off number six on the F.B.I. Most Wanted list.
Way to go, "Hero-darko"!
Rusty Pratt.
Raped and murdered nine women in Washington and Oregon.
- Chief sends his attagirl.
- Excuse me.
- Mayor called too.
- What was Pratt doing here?
He's got family in Bethany.
F.B.I.'s waiting to debrief you down at the Federal Building.
- Then you and I have some questions to answer.
- No.
- Yes.
- Please.
Come on, man.
You may want to put on some lipstick.
Chief Henderson's attending a conference in Denver... but he is very proud of the actions taken here today... by Detective Grace Hanadarko.
The F.B.I. Worked for two years tirelessly on this case.
They identified the killer, and they had him on the run.
Today, nine families have closure because of their hard work... and the watchful eye of one of Oklahoma City's finest.
Now, she's gonna tell you that she was just doing her job... but Chief Henderson and I want to say it was a mighty fine job.
- Detective.
- How does it feel to be a hero?
I lost the suspect.
Riley was the one who found him, flushed him out, sent him over that bridge.
And right now he's fighting for his life.
You guys should be at Oak Hill Animal Hospital,you want to see a real hero.
Get her upl Get her upl
Faster than a speeding serial killer.
More powerful than bullets!
Able to leap city curbs in a single bound!
Whoo.
Whoo, whoo, whoo!
Next thing she's gonna want is a parade.
Whoo!
Wants a street named after her in Bricktown is what I heard.
- National holiday is what I heard.
- Hey, you seen the news?
One of those restaurants had a camera, caught you running straight into gunfire.
- Man, you don't even flinch.
- Whool
Oh, yeahl Whool
Toro
- Hey, Brad.
- Bull.
Come on, bull!
- Come in here to talk about your sorry-ass Trojans?
- Ole!
I need to speak with Detective Hanadarko.
What's this about?
It's about two injured civilians, gunshots in the middle of Bricktown... and your detective performing job-related duties while intoxicated.
- This is a formal I.A. Investigation?
- Yes.
Were you drinking this morning?
- No.
- Hold on.
You want a union rep in here, Grace?
- Don't need one.
- Were you at a bar called J.K.'s?
- No.
- We have an eyewitness... puts you atJ.K.'s drinking shots of tequila.
- That's bullshit.
- You were drinking bourbon, not tequila?
- Which part is bullshit?
- All of it.
- Sounds like we're done.
- Will you submit...
- to a blood alcohol test?
- How do you do your job without throwing up?
You know she was off duty.
You know she just risked her life to chase down an armed killer.
The F.B.I. Wants to give her a medal.
So, seriously, man... how do you do your job without throwing up?
It's a simple question.
Will you submit a blood sample?
- She didn't do anything wrong.
- If she isn't drinking... maybe she does things differently... maybe an innocent kid isn't spending the night in the hospital.
- Kiss my ass, Brad.
- You're suspended pending this investigation.
You might want to hold off on accepting that medal.
- You guys used to date?
- Nah.
We worked Dope together.
After the third time he almost got me killed...
- I told him to get off the streets and get behind a desk.
- Well, he listened to you.
I wouldn't have handled it differently.
I saw you, Grace.
I know.
Big jolt of adrenaline takes care of one and a half beers, right?
It's been six hours.
You're fine.
I don't know who the hell thought they saw me atJ.K.'s.
Car-car.
- Where were you?
- Home.
- Doing what?
- Cleaning.
So you're not gonna tell me about Father Murphy.
Under Oklahoma state law, you can still prosecute him, you know.
Grace, he raped you and who knows how many other children.
Did he at least admit to you what he did to you?
- I gotta go.
- Okay.
Up till now, I've been worried.
Now I'm scared.
Grace, what have you done?
Your Honor.
Your Honor.
Your Honor, every one of these letters is addressed to Santa Claus.
The post office has delivered them.
Therefore, the Post Office Department, a branch of the federal government-
Didn't mean to be gone that long.
How you doing, Father Murphy?
- Straighten her out.
- Be glad to.
Would you please tell her that you're not really Santa Claus... that there actually is no such person?
- Well, I'm sorry-
- I don't want to watch this again.
Uh-huh.
Please.
You said you wanted to talk.
We've talked.
- I've confessed to everything.
- Appreciate it.
If I say I want a lawyer...
- you have to take me in, right?
- Sure.
Remember this?
Do you remember what happened that day?
Leo dared you to ride the roller coaster... start to finish, with both hands in the air.
It took us seven times, but you finally did it.
You don't want your supper?
I can't eat another ice cream sundae.
- You want a beer?
- No.
- Glass of wine?
- Grace...
God brought us back together.
God brought us back together, through Earl, for a reason.
Earl- that shitting' shit angel.
Ooh!
Where is he?
I know he's been in Baltimore a lot lately.
How long have you known Earl?
- Nine years.
- Nine years?
Shit, man.
Mind sitting in this chair, Father?
Are you going to kill me?
Is that what this has all been about?
Kinda.
Appreciate you coming in and talking to us, Ms. Wells.
Deanne.
We just need you to tell us what happened.
Well, I had an appointment with J.K. At 10:30 and he never showed up.
- Appointment for what?
- I want him to expand his menu.
The mayor's got the city on a diet, and J.K. Offers 14 fried appetizers.
- Not exactly a fat-free zone.
- Tell us what you saw.
I saw your cop sitting at the bar drinking shots of tequila.
You talk to the bartender?
I asked aboutJ.K. Other than that, no.
I was working on my pitch.
'Cause we did.
Detective Dewey... what was it the bartender said?
He said he didn't serve anyone shots of tequila this morning.
How many bartenders do you know pour on the side?
I mean, come on.
The guy tossed back a couple himself.
- How long were you there?
- I waited until about 11:00.
- Yeah?
- And then I figured I was stood up, so I left.
This afternoon, I'm at Macaroni Grill on another sales call... and I look up at the TV and see tequila girl... only now she's being called a hero.
That upset you, Deanne?
Just thought you'd like to know what your hero was doing all morning.
- You talk to Grace?
- No answer.
And Deanne Wells is clean.
No record.
Works for a food service company.
I think it's personal.
You bring her back tomorrow.
See if Grace knows her.
- What about I. A?
- I'll deal with I.A.
This is too easy for them not to bite- Grace in a bar, tequila, called in sick.
Legit witness, good story.
Most of it checks out.
Except for the part about Grace being in the bar.
Deanne Wells's word against the bartender.
One of them's lying.
- You got a problem?
You don't believe the bartender?
- The person I believe is Grace.
Everybody else we check out.
You got a problem with that?
We all got a problem, boys.
I.A. Isn't gonna dig... very deep on this one, which means we have to.
They see this?
They see what she did?
...Bricktown, as Oklahoma City's off-duty detective...
Grace Hanadarko, took down one of the F.B.I.'s 10 Most Wanted criminals.
Tomorrow, you find out who's lying.
Grace earned that attagirl.
Let's make sure that she keeps it.
You are such a good boy, Gus.
You've been so patient.
You ready for that steak, Gussy?
You hungry?
Yeah.
Look at that thing.
You want to rip into that, don't you?
You ready?
Take it!
Oh.
Uh-
- How you doing there, Father?
- I said I'd do whatever you want.
Just give me the gun.
- I'll kill myself.
- Suicide's a sin.
So is murder.
- You want to play cards?
- No.
- Twister?
- No.
Mary Frances, Johnny, Joe, Jimmy, Leo, me and Paige.
Seven kids, 14 scrawny arms and legs all tangled up.
- Your idea of paradise.
- We need to pray, Grace.
Dear God, please help me kill Father Murphy.
Amen.
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is with thee.
Blessed art thou among women.
Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.
Holy Mary, Mother of God... pray for us sinners... now and at the hour of our death.
- Amen.
- That hour will arrive as soon as Earl gets here.
Let me do it.
I don't want you to go to prison.
I don't want you to suffer any more because of me.
I'm tired, Grace.
Well, let's liven things up.
Don't let your love go astray
Save it for me
Don't give your sweet kiss away
Save it for me
I know you're feeling blue
'Cause I feel blue like you
I'll be strong as
You are and wait just as long as you
Don't waste that look I adore
Save it for me
Just wait a little bit more
Save it for me
I was actually jealous.
I wanted to hang out with a priest.
I remember once I went bowling with you guys.
Father Murphy piled us all in his station wagon... and Grace and I sat in the front.
He had a statue of the Blessed Mother on his dashboard.
- I felt so special.
- He always kept Grace next to him on the front seat.
You know, I was right there.
We were all right there, Rhetta.
- I know.
- I mean, I've called.
I've left mess-
- I left messages.
She won't return my calls.
- She's not talking about him.
So you don't know if she's gonna press charges.
If she does, is the archdiocese gonna open their files?
Yes.
I went back and checked out the years that Murphy was at Rosary.
There was one complaint in 1977... by Mr. Williams, Amy's father.
- Amy Williams.
- Yeah.
All afternoon, children have dropped off toys and stuffed animals... cards and notes for Riley, who at this hour remains in critical condition.
Detective Grace Hanadarko, whose daring and courageous actions are still under review-
Why is she under review?
They should be giving her a parade.
You know that angel, Earl, who visits Grace?
- Yes.
- He led us to Father Murphy.
- Really?
- He left clues, and we figured them out.
And that's how we learned Murphy wasn't dead.
He was in Tulsa.
Well, those tobacco-chewing angels do all kinds of crazy stuff.
- So you don't believe in miracles.
- I do believe in miracles.
Well, you're missing out on a miracle, Johnny.
Your own sister's got an angel... and you're missing out 'cause you'd rather believe in a God who forgives pedophiles... than a God who sends angels down to Earth to help people.
Why don't you believe in that God?
I do.
You should.
Tell me about Earl.
How you doing?
I hurt her so badly.
Hurt so many children.
How can God still love me?
I just know he does, Patrick.
Well, isn't this sweet?
Heard you want to talk.
No talking.
You can't interfere, right?
- So have a seat, Earl.
- You gonna kill him?
- And you gotta watch.
- You ready to die, Patrick?
- Yes.
- See?
He's gonna be fine.
But you-The hate you feel is gonna follow you for the rest of your life.
Forgive him, and you can move on.
I don't even hate him anymore.
He's just pathetic.
I hate you, Earl.
I hate your angel guts.
You think that's gonna get rid of me?
I seen lions eat Christians, Germans killJews.
The grassy knoll?
That was me.
Watch this, Earl.
You shithead!
I killed the man who molested me when I was a little girl.
Give me the gun.
Don't say anything else.
I need to borrow your minivan.
- I have to take the kids to school.
- It's a holiday.
We're having a parade for Grace.
- Attagirl.
- You don't understand.
I killed him.
- Attagirl.
- Attagirl.
This is Father Patrick Murphy, my alibi forJ.K.'s, by the way.
He raped me when I was in grade school.
He also sexually assaulted 27 other children in 10 states across the country.
I read him his rights.
He's already confessed... but let's get it on tape.
Okay.
Sir, would you go with Detectives Stillwater and Ada?
Let's go.
We need to get a D.A. Over here.
Can we talk a minute?
This priest, Murphy, what he did to Grace- did you know about this?
- Did she bring him in?
- How old was she?
- Ham, you need to-
- How old was she, Rhetta?
How old was she?
It started when she was nine.
Ham, it's all gonna be on record.
Grace knows that.
She doesn't need you going crazy about this right now.
She needs you to be her friend.
I transported the suspect from Tulsa, asked him... if we could talk for a while before I took him to jail.
At no time did he ask to see an attorney.
- Murphy willingly stayed at your house for three days?
- Correct.
I tried to make him comfortable as he told me about... 2,374 sex crimes he committed over the years.
He remembers them all.
Fifty-six he performed against me.
Shit.
Props to you, girl, for not blowing his head off.
- Thanks.
- But he's recanted his confession.
I believe it has something to do with the three archdiocesan attorneys...
- he has hovering around his ass.
- I thought they were cooperating.
They are.
They're gonna open their files... and have Murphy available to us, which blew my skirt back.
- I was expecting a fight.
- So we just let him go, let him walk out?
Look.
We're lucky they're not bringing kidnapping charges against you.
Where was Murphy yesterday when you were out gunslinging in Bricktown?
Just sitting around your house, waiting for you to come home?
Yeah.
He was watching a movie.
- Maybe handcuffed?
- Absolutely not.
Look.
We got three attorneys to take him back to Tulsa and a cardinal to vouch for him.
Murphy's going down.
Seven out of 10 states have claims against him.
We'll duke it out, see where he gets the most time.
Bring this to me when you have statements from the other two victims you went to school with.
- One of them's dead.
- Parents alive?
Siblings?
Friends?
Find out if they knew about the abuse.
I imagine the church is going to want to avoid a trial... so we'll either end up with a plea, or they'll make a settlement offer.
- The last thing I want's money.
- That-a-girl.
I don't know whether to hug you or kick your ass.
Hug.
- You sure you're ready for this?
- I should've just killed him, huh?
I.A. Lifted your suspension.
Your blood alcohol level came back normal.
No one else places you at this bar except this woman.
- You know her?
- No.
Deanne Wells.
No idea what you could've done to piss her off?
- This mean I'm back on duty?
- You know you can't investigate Murphy.
We're gonna do this right.
We're gonna put this shit-hole away.
He'll be murdered in prison within a year.
Okay?
Meanwhile... go find out why Ms. Wells is spreading lies about you.
- Listen.
L-
- I used to put roadkill on Murphy's hamburgers.
- Really?
- Possum guts.
Listen, if you ever need anything-
I mean anything-just ask.
I'm there.
I'm there.
I thought you killed him.
- Rhetta, come on, man.
- Thank God.
- Let go.
- You scared the shit out of me.
Would you have loaned me your minivan to bury him?
No.
- I was gonna wrap him in plastic, so I wouldn't transfer evidence.
- Thoughtful.
- I couldn't do it.
- That's a good thing.
How do I tell my mom?
When this comes out, I think she'll know, Grace.
- What if she doesn't believe me?
- Of course she'll believe you.
Earl is Murphy's last-chance angel too.
What?
You heard me.
That's-That's really-
Screwed up.
What did Earl say?
He's been in Baltimore.
Agent Ross Ford.
- Detective Ham Dewey, O.C.P.D.
- Yeah, what's up?
I need to talk to you about a Father Patrick Murphy.
You mind coming back to the office?
The Father Murphy I know is dead.
- I'll explain back at the office.
- Explain here.
He's not dead.
He's, um- Look.
Let's just go back-
The only Father Murphy I know is dead.
I thought this was about some case.
Well, Murphy is not dead.
He's retired, living in Tulsa... and we're investigating him for sexual abuse.
- Someone accuse him?
- Nah.
He confessed.
Should make it easy on you guys.
He confessed what he did to you.
- Didn't do anything to me.
- Look.
Let's just go back to the office.
Look.
He was a priest at my grade school.
If he was diddling kids in the cloakroom, I don't know anything about it.
- Hey.
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.
Lisa Cleary.
- Ham Dewey.
How you doing?
This is my fiancee.
Tell you what.
Give me your card.
- If I think of something, I'll give you a call.
- All right.
- What happened in 1977, Mr. Williams?
- Oh.
I, uh
- I handed Amy a bowl of ice cream... and she burst out crying, said Father Murphy kissed her.
So I met with the bishop... and I told him that I didn't want Murphy ever to come around Amy again.
And he didn't.
And I need to see him.
- You can't see him, sir.
- You don't know what he did to my daughter.
- Did Amy tell you about the abuse?
- She never said another word.
Did she tell Michael?
Your wife?
Uh, no.
No.
She-She-She-She-
She wrote a journal- everything that he did to her.
- May we see this journal, Mr. Williams?
- Yes.
We found it after Amy killed herself... after she put my shotgun in her mouth and killed herself.
Several high schools have joined together, forming a prayer chain of thousands... so that around the clock, every single second, someone is praying for Riley.
And in Bricktown tonight, a candlelight vigil is scheduled for 9:00 p. m.
I'm telling you, man.
He's gonna make it.
He rallied this afternoon, then his fever spiked.
- He's fighting some kind of infection.
- Fighting's right.
You got Grace's statement over there?
Yeah.
You read it?
One of us has to read it.
Father Patrick Murphy has been murdered.
They found his body in the Paseo District.
Anyone know where Grace is?
- How long has he been dead, Henry?
- Couple hours at the most.
Shot in the forehead.
Look at his knees.
They're dirty.
- Yeah, like he was kneeling.
- Like he was executed.
Go ahead.
Ask me.
- You want to ask me?
- Did you kill him?
No.
Grace, I don't know why God sent Earl to both you and Murphy... or why someone killed him, or why I feel incredibly happy with zero guilt.
I just know that you can't let this come between you and Earl... and you have to promise me that.
I promise.
- Hi, Grace.
- Hi, Henry.
Shit, man.
Hey.
It wasn't me.
Me either.
We got at least 27 other suspects.
Yeah.
Out-of-state suspects.
You think so?
I was in a bar.
I was.
Ask Louie.
Been there all afternoon.
Hey.
Ask Billy Gasko.
Here's his number.
- We shot some pool.
- Inside Murphy's car is a pike receipt.
He hit Oklahoma City at 3:21.
- Little over two hours ago.
- He must have got to Tulsa, turned around and drove back.
So much for a cardinal and three attorneys.
Okay.
He came back to meet someone.
Why here?
That used to be Ida's Ice Cream.
Murphy'd bring me here to Ida's for an ice cream sundae.
Did the same with Amy Williams.
I read it in her journal.
You think her father's capable of this?
- Just about every father I know is capable of this.
- He bring Ross Ford here too?
He won't even admit he was molested.
Are you guys friends?
Nah.
I run into him sometimes.
I just got an invitation to his wedding.
Christmas reunions.
You never go.
Bring them both in, please.
Grace.
- You gotta let me work this case.
- This time I am gonna check your alibi.
- You been drinking?
- No.
Come on.
You know I didn't kill Murphy.
I know you wanted to kill him.
I know you thought about killing him.
What I don't know is why you'd want to arrest the person who did.
First, to thank him.
Second, it's my job.
Third, I understand him.
All right.
I'll talk to the D.A.
Mr. Williams, Father Murphy hurt a lot ofkids, and they never told anyone.
Amy told you, and you stopped it.
How many children did he hurt?
A lot.
Do you know any of the places he used to take Amy?
- Did he used to take her to the movies?
- Yes.
- Balwin.
- Hmm.
- Uh, Frontier City.
- They ever go for ice cream?
- Oh, they went for ice cream a lot.
- Where'd they go?
L
- I don't know, Grace.
- Wasn't it in her journal?
- My wife read her journal.
L
- I couldn't.
I didn't want to know.
We used to do this in high school, Hanadarko.
Shit.
We used to do this in grade school.
Fifth grade, behind the gym.
Who gave you your first cigarette?
Stole it out of my mom's purse.
I stole mine from Father Murphy.
- Stole mine out of my mom's purse.
- Ross.
Come on, man.
You know how this is gonna play out.
- Yeah, you got shit.
I'll be home in an hour.
- Maybe.
But I know what happened, you know what happened, and we both know why.
Wasn't it bizarre?
Going to Ida's right after sex with Murphy?
All that noise, the lights... kids bouncing off the walls.
I was always sick to my stomach.
Sore.
Felt like everyone knew.
You guys got the wrong intel on me.
Mmm.
You're a cop.
You got Murphy's information, called... asked him to meet you at Ida's.
He said he'd do whatever you want, and when he got there... he knelt down, just like you said.
That's gonna get you the death penalty, Ross.
It's gonna be hard to prove.
Amy's dad didn't know about Ida's.
- Leaves you and me.
- You kill him?
No.
Why not?
Didn't have the balls.
Right now, you're just here for questioning.
And you did good.
But inside that door... we're checking your alibi, dumping your phone, computer... and getting together a canvass that starts at first light.
You need to get out of town, Ross.
You got about 12 hours.
Go.
- Sure.
Whatever.
- Nothing.
If we bring him back tomorrow, you think you'll be able to break him?
Depends.
What do we got?
We got video from a couple businesses in the area.
It shows Murphy drive up and park at 3:40.
- Doesn't show anyone else.
- Ford says he was working a case.
I talked to his partner.
She backed him up.
Well, I'm shocked.
N
- Nobody saw anything?
Didn't hear a gunshot?
- Might've used a silencer.
- Did you check out the Williams alibi?
- Yeah.
He was with his grandson.
- You check out mine?
- Billy Gasko says hi.
- Leaves Ross Ford.
Why couldn't he have shot him in Tulsa?
Go home, everybody.
Get some sleep.
Tomorrow's gonna be a rough day.
You okay?
Yeah.
- Need a ride or anything?
- No, thanks.
- See you guys in the morning.
- Okay.
You want to get a drink?
I gotta meet somebody.
- Thanks for meeting me.
- Get you something to drink?
- Yeah.
A beer.
You want anything?
- Uh, no.
So, I was hoping we could talk.
You threatened to have me arrested.
You filed a false police report.
Nothing false about you being a drunk.
Okay.
Look.
I pulled your marriage license.
Your name used to be Whiteside.
Deanne Whiteside.
You were friends with my sister, Mary Frances.
I remember you now.
You were a brat.
Deanne, look.
I don't understand.
You get your own sister killed, and then you don't even go to her funeral?
How do you sleep at night?
The day before the bombing, Mary Frances and I had plans.
Meet at the Murrah Building, take care of some business, and then go join a gym... because she had just had that baby and, well, I was just fat.
Only you called 20 minutes after you were supposed to be at her house watching Clay... to tell her you were sick.
Get you anything else?
- N-No, thanks.
- Mary Frances was so pissed at you.
She knew you were hungover.
So we canceled our plans.
The next day, she got your mom to babysit.
I couldn't go.
I had a doctor's appointment.
I saw you all over the news that day too, holding that baby.
They called you a hero.
You weren't a hero that day.
And you weren't a hero yesterday.
And a good morning, everybody.
Well, I'll tell you, your prayers are working, folks.
Riley made it through another night.
This dog, I tell you-
He's all my kids are talking about.
We actually went to the candlelight vigil last night, held at-
Mom!
You're on a cruise!
I got back last night.
Oh.
Here's a little something I brought back for you and Paige from Greece.
I think this has been my favorite one of all.
- Better than Alaska?
- I think so.
- Coffee, please?
- I gotta get to work.
- You know, take a shower.
- Oh, you have time for a little chat.
One cup of coffee.
I haven't seen you in weeks.
Honey, why haven't you called your brothers or sister?
Do you know I was in the middle of the Atlantic... looked up at the television, and there you were...
Oklahoma City hero.
We're all very proud of you.
This is really pretty, Mom.
- I'm glad you like it, dear.
- Thanks.
But you have to be more careful.
Promise me.
And mean it.
- I promise.
- Now let's talk about Father Murphy.
I opened up the paper this morning and couldn't believe my eyes.
- What happened?
- He was murdered.
- Who killed him?
- We don't know yet.
Why are they suggesting he was a child molester?
Because he was.
Well, he was always so good with you kids.
Please, be careful, honey.
The church has been through so much.
...this morning, in case you haven't heard about it.
He's alert.
He's wagging his tail.
He ate some food.
Ate a lot, I heard.
I guess he was hungry.
This is always a good sign.
Riley is gonna make it, folks.
Riley is gonna make it.
Hey, hey!
Before you know it, he'll be back on his feet.
Yeah.
Hey.
This is Lisa Cleary, Ross Ford's fiancee.
She's worried about her daughter, Hannah.
- Your daughter?
- I had to go to Dallas last night.
My mom had a car accident.
And this morning, when I got home...
I walked in on...
Ross giving Hannah a bath.
She's 11.
He's-
She's too old for him to be giving her a bath.
He apologized.
He doesn't have kids.
I thought maybe he doesn't know.
But when I took Hannah to school, she started crying.
She... told me it's not the first bath he's given her.
She went back to break off their engagement.
He wasn't home.
I was on my way to work, but I knew I had to report this, so I turned around to come here.
But he called me.
He wanted me to meet him at home.
I told him it was over.
Mm-hmm.
Do you have visual confirmation?
That's affirmative.
You better get a bus.
- Suspect shot himself.
- Be sure we're clear before we go in.
- Where you been, Earl?
- I been busy.
- What you been up to?
- Not much.
Brought you something from Baltimore.
Well, you just open it when you want to.
- You know about Murphy?
- Yeah.
- And Ross Ford.
- And Hannah?
And Hannah.
I'm sorry.
I know, child.
- ENCODE + SENCRON - ***** CaLLiOPE-_MoNTEDiaZ *****
Okay.
911 emergency.
I need an ambulance.
I have you at 9212 West Third Street in Los Angeles.
Yes, room number 2.
What's the emergency?
There's been a suicide.
Who's the victim?
I am.
In seven days, God created the world.
And in seven seconds I shattered mine.
- I can have four new fillets overnight.
- Oh, no.
No, thank you.
What is your name again?
Ezra?
Is that right?
Yes, sir.
I'll just need your first and last name so I can call up your account.
- You know what?
Here's what I'm thinking, Ezra.
I think I'm gonna mail you the meat back so you can see firsthand the type of dog food that you're peddling.
That won't be necessary, sir.
So how about we just start with your last name?
Thomas.
And don't even get me started on the pork.
- Have you tried the pork?
- Well, no, sir.
I'm not much of a meat eater myself, but I hear really great things about the pork.
- Oh, so you don't eat pork at all?
- No, sir.
Are you Jewish?
Is that why you don't eat pork, Ezra?
Well, can we...?
What's your first name, Mr. Thomas?
Ben.
Hold on, what was that voice?
I don't...
I don't have an order for a Ben Thomas.
Ezra, what was that voice?
- What voice?
- Are you blind?
- Excuse me?
- You're kidding me.
A blind beef salesman who doesn't eat meat.
Now, that...
That is rich.
That is rich.
Have you ever had sex, Ezra?
Did Lawrence in Accounting put you up to this?
Because somehow I can't imagine the blind, vegan beef salesman having sex.
- Listen, I'm trying to help you, sir.
- You're trying to help me?
The blind beef salesman is trying to help me?
I'm actually starting to feel pretty bad for you, Ezra.
Because I look at my life, and it is surrounded by so much beauty and you can't see shit.
Is that fair?
Does that seem fair to you, Ezra?
Do you even know what color the ocean is?
Do you?
- It's blue, sir.
- "It's blue, sir."
Say what you wanna say.
React.
Say what you wanna say to me.
Thank you for calling Cheyenne Meats.
That's not what you wanna say, you coward.
You coward.
You blind, vegan, beef-salesman, virgin coward!
- Goodbye, Mr. Thomas.
- Say what you wanna say.
Ken Anderson.
Nicole Anderson.
Allie Anderson.
Ed Rice.
Steven Phillips.
Monica Freeman.
Sarah Jensen.
Ken Anderson!
Nicole Anderson!
Allie Anderson!
Ed Rice!
Steven Phillips!
Monica Freeman!
And Sarah Jensen!
Hi, can I help you?
Yes.
Hello, I'm looking for Emily.
- You're a friend of hers?
- Yes, ma'am.
- She's not home.
- Oh, goodness.
No, she left this morning.
She had to do some more tests.
She asked me to watch Duke until she got back.
Okay.
You ever try mixing banana peel into the soil?
- Really?
- It works, I swear.
Oh, would you by chance know where I could find her?
Supervisor to 104.
Supervisor to 104.
Cardiac wing?
Take the elevator to the fifth floor then turn left.
Thank you.
Well, that's what I was just saying.
It's absolutely impossible.
Hold the elevator.
Thank you.
Can I help you?
Yes.
Good evening.
I'm here to see Emily Posa.
I'm sorry, visiting hours are from 8 a.m. To 4 p.m.
You know, it is really important I speak to her for just a moment.
You'll just have to come back during visiting hours.
Thank you very much.
So if there is one thing that I have learned and you all should remember about winning these contracts:
Three steps.
First, tell them what you're gonna tell them.
Step two, you tell them.
Step three, tell them what you told them.
We are gonna close by reminding them that old girl has a 3-percent better impulse from sea level to vacuum and if they pass on that, quite frankly, they deserve another Sputnik.
Now, if you will excuse me I have a very lovely, very hungry woman at home waiting for me.
Sarah.
Honey.
Everyone at work kept saying it was daylight-savings time.
You were supposed to be here a while ago.
- I kept saying it wasn't.
- This happens all the time.
It's work.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- No, I'm angry with you.
I'm gonna be angry all night long.
- I'm angry with you.
- What are you doing?
How about that?
How about I'm angry with you?
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.
It's your brother.
Where are you?
I'm at the beach house.
Are you okay?
Of course.
Listen, why'd you disconnect the landline?
The phone broke.
I don't need it anymore.
Did I?
Did I do something?
No.
Not unless you're smoking again.
No, I've put on 20 pounds.
I'm in the best shape of my life.
Are you eating?
Are you taking care of yourself?
- You sound terrible again and...
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Look, I gotta go.
Give Melanie and the kids a hug and a kiss.
I'll talk to you later.
You take care of yourself.
Hold on.
I know it's been a while, but when you were staying here you didn't take something of mine by mistake, did you?
I remember giving you something.
You remember that?
Because I remember that very clearly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just remember I love you.
Hi, my name is Ben Thomas.
I'm here to see Stewart Goodman.
Inez, look at me, please.
Inez.
I'm speaking to you.
I understand you refused to take your meds again.
Is that true?
No, no, no.
Let's try using your words this time, okay, Inez?
I mean, this silent treatment isn't doing anybody any good.
Inez, how can we help you if...?
Okay, how about I come back tomorrow and see if you've changed your mind, okay?
Thattagirl.
I thought I was coming to your office today.
I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd stop by, save you the drive.
Terrific.
Well, look, let's go talk in my office, yeah?
Come on.
I take a no-nonsense approach.
I mean, I cut the operating costs of this place over 17 percent last year alone.
- I'm sure that made them happy.
- Oh, hell, yeah.
Now, if I could only get my own finances in that kind of shape, I wouldn't have you sitting here.
No offense.
That your new Beemer out front?
Ben, I mean, when I found out that my bone-marrow transplant wasn't successful...
I'm well aware of your ongoing medical condition.
Things aren't looking very promising for me.
Look I have a bonus coming in January.
I just really need this six-month extension.
Really, I mean, I am doing the very best I can here, I promise you.
I'm gonna show myself out.
I'll be in touch.
Well, thank you.
I appreciate it.
I mean, this way everybody wins, right?
Hello.
My name is Ben.
I totally understand if you don't wanna speak to me either.
But I would really like to just have a moment of your time.
I'm trying to figure out what kind of man Stewart Goodman is.
It is within my power to drastically change his circumstances.
But I don't wanna give that man a gift that he doesn't deserve.
I need you to tell me whether or not he is a good person.
"The drug he gives me makes me dizzy.
I want a new one."
Well, that sounds very reasonable, Inez.
What else?
You can trust me.
What else, Inez?
He's punishing you?
How is he punishing you?
How is he punishing you, Inez?
Ben?
- Hey, Ben, where you going?
- Where's the washroom?
To the right.
Is there a problem?
- Give her a bath, right now.
- Absolutely.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You have the wrong impression here.
I'm gonna stop by from time to time make sure you're showing these people some respect.
Look, this is a misunderstanding, okay?
You don't treat people like that.
Let me explain, okay, Ben?
- And I'm not giving you an extension.
- Ben!
I'm not giving you anything.
I almost believed you, you son of a bitch.
I almost believed.
Okay.
Grip and rip.
This time it's gonna be a lot different.
Hey.
- Hey, Michelle.
- Hey.
- Good to see you.
- You too.
- How are you?
- I'm good.
- Hey, man.
- Hey.
What are you doing here?
Just coming to make sure that she is still kicking your ass at everything.
And I am.
- Can we have a sec, hon?
- Yeah.
All right.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm good.
You said you were gonna call me on the 15th.
- Today is the 19th.
- I know.
Doctor didn't have the results, so I had no information to give you.
Still, you should call me.
- Yeah, I know.
Yes, I know.
- We're still friends.
Right?
Yeah.
I'm just...
I'm doing some soul-searching, you know?
Don't do that.
- We have a plan.
- I know.
- Do what you promised me.
- I will.
You know, they rent clubs up at the clubhouse.
I'm well aware of that.
I think I'm gonna keep my ass unkicked today.
Were you looking at him, or were you looking at me?
Actually, I was just sitting here.
Am I doing it wrong?
I think I saw you in the elevator the other day.
Oh, yes.
Actually, you are being audited.
My name is Ben Thomas.
I'm with the IRS, and you owe the government $56, 240.19.
I know.
And now you get me.
Would you have a seat, please, Miss Posa?
So I've been looking over the income statements from the last three years.
- 2005...
- Were...?
Were you in my room the other night?
No, ma'am, I was not in your room the other night.
That's not exactly IRS protocol.
So I've been looking over '05, '06 and '07.
There seems to be quite a disparity between what you claimed and...
Mr. Thomas?
I just got discharged.
So, you know, unless you're gonna, like haul me off to some IRS jail or something I'd really like to get home now.
- Oh, sure.
No problem.
- Okay.
I'll be in touch.
Welcome to the Travel Inn.
Can I help you?
I need a room.
How many hours?
About two weeks.
Clear it!
That's it, that's it!
All right, come on!
Vamos, Manny!
All right, all right.
That's it, that's it.
Hey!
- What you want?
- Break it up!
- You want some of this?
- Get off!
Get off!
Hey, Rico, knock it off!
Somebody wanna remind Rico where we are?
The sanctuary, coach!
- I can't hear you.
- The sanctuary, coach!
That's right, Rico, in the sanctuary.
Now give me 20 starts and stops.
Hello, this is Emily Posa.
I'm not home right now, but please leave a message and I'll call you back as soon as possible.
Thank you.
Hi, my name is Susan Nall.
I'm calling because a friend told me you do letterpress invitations, and I was wondering...
Hello?
Hi, this is Emily.
Yep, I do wedding invitations.
I'm not able to take any requests, though, right now.
I know someone nearby who does it.
She's not as good as I am, but her prices are very...
Hello?
Duke?
Duke.
We're out here.
Hello, Miss Posa.
What are you doing here?
Oh, I came to see you.
Don't you people ever call ahead?
You people tend to try to hide things.
Is that meat?
No!
No, no.
No.
No meat.
No.
- Well, he was really enjoying it.
- He eats steamed broccoli and tofu.
- Why?
- He's a vegetarian.
- He is a vegetarian?
- Yes.
Well, that sucks.
Hey, can we talk?
Do you have a moment?
No.
Actually, I have to take Duke for a walk.
No problem.
I'll go with you, if you don't mind.
- So...
- Hey, hey.
Hey.
So I've been looking over 2005, 2006 and 2007.
Now...
I'm listening.
- Can I get him for you?
- Nope.
I got him.
Let me get him.
Let me get him.
Let me get him.
- You all right?
- Yes.
Whoa, sorry.
Whoa, not these.
- That's okay.
Watch...
- No, no.
Heel, heel, heel.
Yeah, maybe we shouldn't feed him meat.
So I've been looking over...
- Yeah, maybe we can do this later.
- Yeah.
So you cook it all ahead of time, I see.
No, actually.
I can't remember the last time I cooked.
This is my sister's way of looking out for me from afar.
Do you have any siblings?
Yes, one brother.
He's a...
He's a good egg.
Yeah, I just have the one sister too.
Are you receiving income from any source that the government is currently unaware of?
Well, lately I've been taking to diving in local wishing wells, so...
I mean, but it's just occasional dimes here and there or, once in a while, a quarter.
No, actually I had to refinance this place to pay my past-due medical bills.
I've been informed that you suffer from congenital heart failure.
Yes.
Did you gather that while stalking me at the hospital?
No, I...
You're currently Status 2, which means you're sick enough to be on the national UNOS waiting list but not sick enough to be admitted into the hospital and placed on Status 1.
So basically, if your heart starts to fail quickly and no donor can be located you're screwed.
Is it true that you said that you do not believe that you even deserve a heart because your life is unremarkable in every way?
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I said that.
I'm sorry.
Do you have to take any type of sensitivity training to join the IRS, Mr. Thomas?
- No, not really.
- Yeah.
So you don't consider yourself a good person?
How would you answer that question if I asked you the same?
"Unremarkable" would be an upgrade for me I assure you.
I'm gonna freeze your accounts as uncollectible until further notice.
I'm sure that'll buy you five or six months, penalty-free.
Here's my card.
If anyone from the IRS tries to contact you you call me immediately.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay.
- Mr. Thomas?
- Yes.
Why do I get the feeling you're doing me a really big favor right now?
Because I get the feeling that you really deserve it.
All right?
You off to?
You off to pollute someone else's dog now?
No.
Just going home.
Where's that?
Take care, Emily.
You too.
- What is this thing for?
- I told you already.
And why are you bringing a fish into your room?
Because it's my room.
And I don't want anyone going into my room, understood?
Well, I don't think you can keep a fish in your room.
I think I can.
Well, I've never had anybody who kept a fish in their room.
Now you do.
Who?
Good night.
The first time I ever saw a box jellyfish I was 12.
Our father took us to the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
I never forgot when he said that it was the most deadly creature on earth.
To me it was just the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.
I spoke to the doctor again.
He's gonna send over your files in the morning.
- Is this everything?
- Yeah.
- Any questions?
- Same one.
Well, same answer, then.
You know, I was thinking last night about when we were 14 and we made our big pact.
You remember on the beach in front of your grandparents' house we agreed that we would never, never date each other's girls?
I remembered that that night you told me how much you liked Stacy Miller and that you were gonna ask her out.
And I said:
"Hey, man.
You can't.
Her and I already did it."
Which we didn't, but I wanted to but she liked you way more than she liked me, and...
So I lied to you because I was so jealous.
And I realized that I've been carrying around this lie in my heart for the last 25...
Stop it!
Stop it.
Stay focused.
Do what you promised me.
- What, you think I'm...?
- Do what you promised me.
You think I'm gonna let you down now, don't you?
I've known you my whole damn life!
Okay?
This?
This?
This is not something you do every day.
Okay?
This is...
This is not easy for me.
I'll make sure everything goes as planned.
Don't worry.
Thank you.
Oh, my God.
Hello, Holly.
Look at you.
- What are you doing here?
- I came to see you.
- Really?
- You have a minute?
Sure.
Come on in.
Here's my desk.
Have a seat.
You look great.
- I do?
- Yes.
I feel great.
- How are you?
- I'm really good.
I need a favor.
Whatever you need, just ask me.
I need a name.
Someone in the system.
Someone having a really hard time that needs help, but may be too proud to ask for a handout.
What are you doing?
I'm helping.
I need a name.
Okay.
Connie Tepos.
Her boyfriend almost killed her last year when she tried to leave.
He broke three of her ribs last month.
She's scared to death to press charges and we can't do anything.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Connie Tepos?
- Yes?
My name is Ben Thomas.
I'm with the IRS.
IRS?
But I always pay my taxes.
Yes, this is more of a general inquiry.
I don't understand.
What...?
May I come in?
Not now.
My boyfriend is not here.
It's very important for your family.
For my family?
Beautiful.
Please, have a seat.
What's this all about?
Your case has come to my attention.
And I wanted to get to know you.
You wanted to get to know me?
Why?
Because I'd like to help you.
I don't understand.
I'm aware of your case.
And your boyfriend.
What are you talking about?
You know what I'm talking about.
No, I have no idea what you're talking about.
Kids, go to your room.
He's coming back?
He's not coming back.
You said you were from the IRS, but you're lying to me.
- No.
- You're not telling me the truth.
Who sent you here?
Please sit down.
I'm not going to sit down.
- Please, calm down.
- I'm not going to calm down.
You come into my house.
You talking to me about mi caso y mi boyfriend?
- Who sent you here?
- Nobody.
Nobody?
Get out of my house immediately.
You can trust me.
I trust no one, Mr. Thomas.
I talked to Holly.
I can get you out of here.
To a safe place.
A beautiful place.
Why did you talk to Holly?
Your children are in danger here.
Don't talk about my kids, Mr. Thomas.
- You don't know.
- You don't have to live like this.
Get out of my house now or I'm gonna call the police.
- Okay, okay.
- Who are you?
- I want you to take my card.
- I don't need help.
I want you to take my card, and call me...
- I don't need it.
- I'm gonna leave it.
Okay.
Thank you.
Get out right now.
- You're not helpless.
- Can you leave?
This is my house.
Please, just think about it.
I don't need you.
- I can't talk right now.
- I need to talk immediately.
- Where are you?
- I'm nowhere.
I'm gonna meet you at the house.
Look, no.
I'm not at the house.
I'm traveling.
I'll talk to you next week.
No, no, no.
We need to discuss this right now.
Wouldn't wanna get on her bad side.
- I'll sign to that.
- Yeah.
How you doing, you two?
I'm good.
Got a big day.
Yep.
No more dialysis, George.
See you in the O.R.
Yep.
- I'll see you there as well.
- Yes, sir.
Thank you.
So I heard you raised enough money to give a couple of the kids partial scholarships to college.
It's no big deal.
I just convinced a couple of bigwig donors that what the world really needs to see is more Latinos on ice.
You know, Ben, I keep asking you this but why me?
Because you are a good man.
No, really.
Even when you don't know that people are watching you.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Okay, I can't hear you, so try back again.
Gonna hang up now.
Bye.
Mr. Thomas?
We're ready for you.
These are beautiful.
Banana peels.
Who knew?
Emily?
Can I get a refill?
- Susan?
- Yeah.
How's Ryan?
He's good.
He's at his dad's this weekend.
Will you tell him for me that I'm ready whenever he is for a free lesson?
Yeah, all right.
Things are kind of crazy right now with school but maybe when school's out.
Oh, yeah.
That's perfect.
How's the pie?
Oh, it's...
It's good.
You gonna ask her out?
The waitress.
No.
You never know.
I don't...
I don't think she sees me.
Good night, Ezra.
Hello?
Ben?
Hi, I'm sorry to call so late.
Did...?
Did someone from the IRS contact you?
No.
I just...
I was having trouble breathing after I took Duke for a walk, and I fainted.
An ambulance had to take me to the hospital.
I'm so sorry.
I don't know why I even called you.
I'm sorry.
It's just that I have your card with me, and...
Ben?
Are you still there?
Yes.
Do you ever think about dying, Ben?
Every now and again.
My face is bluish.
It's not exactly a good sign.
You should try to rest.
Just...
Why don't you see if you can get some sleep?
I like talking to you.
I like talking to you too.
Would you tell me a story, please?
Okay.
All right.
Once upon a time there was a little boy named...
Oh, lucky me, you just got it on reserve like that.
Okay.
Let me guess.
His name was Ben.
No, actually, this little boy's name is Tim.
I like the name Tim.
Go on.
Tim's little brother was always pestering Tim to make him paper airplanes, because he was really good at it.
But Tim had much bigger dreams than that.
Okay.
Then what happened?
One day, Tim went out to the backyard and he put leaves and taped branches to his arms and started climbing the big oak tree.
His little brother said, "Tim, you can't fly."
And he said, "Yeah?
You just watch."
He got all the way to the top and jumped.
How tall was this tree?
It was...
It was pretty tall.
He broke his arm.
Oh, my God...
This is a horrible story.
Oh, no, no.
It gets better.
From that experience, Tim realized that he wanted to fly.
So he dedicated his life to making spaceships.
I thought you said this was a good story.
Oh, well...
Yeah, that is until the dragons showed up.
Oh, okay, see, now it's getting better.
I like dragons.
Especially dragons in space.
Yes, and these were fire-breathing space dragons with really bad attitudes.
I see.
I have an idea.
Why don't you try to fall asleep and when you do, I'll just hang up.
Okay.
Ben?
Yes.
Thank you for listening.
And for talking.
Try to fall asleep.
Good night, Ben.
Good night, Emily.
Emily?
Emily?
I lied to you.
I think about dying every day.
Dr. King to NICU.
Dr. Wesley King, please report to NICU.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
When did you get here?
Last night, after we talked.
You slept here?
Good morning.
How's our patient?
- Morning.
Better.
- Good.
- Hello.
- Hi, Ben.
Is that right?
IRS?
- Yes, how are you?
- Good, thank you.
- I'll leave you two alone.
- No, no, stay, please.
Don't go.
He can...
He can stay.
Whatever you want.
You fainted because your heart was too weak to pump enough blood to your brain.
It's enlarged and it's starting to shut down.
How long?
It's entirely up to your heart.
Could be six weeks, could be a month.
But we've upped you to Status 1 B.
At least I'm on the list.
Not only that, but we're giving you this pager.
And when it goes off, it means you have a donor.
The inotrope drug I started you on it's gonna stabilize your blood pressure within 24 hours.
Then what?
We wait.
- Can I do that at home?
- Once you're stable, you can.
Okay.
I'm gonna run to the cafeteria.
I'm gonna get you something.
If you want something else, I can get you something else.
Would you stay?
I mean, unless you have something else to do.
- I'd really like it if you stayed.
- I don't have anything.
Okay.
Okay.
Hey, hey, hey.
What the hell is that thing?
It's a dog.
Just for one night.
No.
Hold on, hold on.
I don't give two shits, okay?
We have a dog policy here.
Little dogs only.
Poodles and Shih Tzus.
It's in the contract.
It's English and Spanish for everyone to see.
And besides, that, my friend, is not a dog.
It's a goddamn horse.
Well, let me know when you add a horse policy to the contract.
Yes.
Mr. Thomas, it's Connie Tepos.
Hey, Connie.
I don't know why I'm calling you but I'm calling you.
You said you could help us and...
Can you really help us?
This just doesn't make any sense.
- What if he finds us?
- He won't.
- What makes you so sure?
- Stop it.
- You don't know him.
- Stop it.
Don't be weak.
- Don't be weak.
- I'm not weak.
I'm strong.
Take this.
Take it.
You are gonna start this car and you're gonna go.
This is real, and this is gonna be your new life.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
Look at those babies.
Look at those babies.
Look how beautiful those babies are.
I know, I know.
They deserve it.
Okay?
You're headed north up the coast.
Lorena.
Lorena.
I've always believed this place can heal the soul.
Mommy, the ocean.
Yes, the ocean.
I hope that proves true for you.
When you sign your name on the dotted line of the contract you'll own my house outright.
I only ask that you never mention how you got the house or try to contact me for any reason.
And if you're wondering why you, please stop.
All I ask is for you to honor my wishes and, of course, live life abundantly.
Hey.
Thanks.
Got it.
Hi, Duke.
Hi, baby.
What time does the nurse come?
She should be there by the time I get home.
- Ben?
- Yes.
I know I'm the girl with the broken wing.
But who are you?
Who am I?
I am your friendly neighborhood tax collector.
Ben.
Where the hell did you come from?
I grew up in Oakland.
Literally.
Okay.
Where did you go to college?
As far from Oakland as possible.
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
How about you?
UCLA.
You went to MIT?
Like, the MIT?
Oh, and now you're wondering how I wound up as a lowly tax collector.
Absolutely.
- I sort of stumbled into this job.
- That's a big stumble.
What from?
I always wanted to be an engineer.
An engineer?
What kind?
The kind that sent people to the moon.
Really?
Yes.
I don't wanna talk about me anymore.
That's too bad, because you're very interesting.
Have you...?
Have you ever been in love?
Emily, please.
Yes, you have.
Come on, you can tell me.
Yes.
But it ended.
- What happened?
- Stop it.
- No, seriously, you can tell...
- Stop it.
You need to get some rest.
I'll call you tomorrow, or maybe I'll stop by.
No, if I have questions tomorrow, what then?
That's not a part of the deal.
What the hell does that mean?
Emily, hold on.
Hold on.
- Just leave.
- Emily, wait.
Wait!
Thank you for everything you did.
Did you like the eggs?
They were okay, I guess.
I don't like the eggs you buy.
Okay.
You're wearing suit pants.
To weed.
Yeah, I didn't...
I didn't have any other clothes with me.
- You know, I was gonna get to those.
- I saw them the other day.
I figured I would just take the day off and get this done for you.
Ben?
Yeah?
This is a really ridiculous apology.
Come on.
I wanna show you something.
Oh, no, I gotta finish.
You can finish tomorrow.
Come on.
This is where I used to work.
And these are the artifacts of said work.
Wow, those are great.
How old are they?
This one is just shy of 120 years.
It's how I put out my line of letterpress cards, wedding invitations, invites.
What about this one?
That youngster is the Heidelberg Windmill, 1956.
Call it "The Beast."
Well, that seems appropriate.
It pooped out on me about five years ago, though.
And I can't find anybody to fix it.
It's kind of a dying art.
Defibrillator here works, though.
Luckily.
It kept my business afloat.
Wanna see how?
Please.
Okay.
Now, true pressmen hate that we modern girls want a deep impression.
See, for a hundred years, they tried their damnedest just to kiss it so that it didn't leave an indentation.
Now it's the only way to prove it's not digital.
I think it feels richer.
You okay?
Yeah.
Look, Ben...
I don't really know anything about you or where you came from but you keep showing up.
And I'm glad.
Okay.
Okay.
So Duke needs a walk.
Are you interested?
Yes.
Come on.
Hey, hey.
Right here.
There you go.
He's like a different dog with you around.
I don't think we ever properly bonded.
Why would you get such a big dog?
Did you know that Great Danes on average only live about seven years?
They have heart issues.
I think I got him because I thought he could help me with my illness.
It'd be something I could take care of as opposed to being always taken care of.
You know, just so you know, I used to be really hot.
Like, unauditably hot.
Is that so?
Yeah.
I haven't felt like this in a really long time.
There's so many things that I wanna do.
I wanna go on a plane for 13 hours and not have to stress that I can't reach my doctor.
You know, like, just travel.
Go backpacking, have experiences.
See the world.
I just wanna have the time to figure out who it is that I am.
You know, what I like.
Do things, try things, get out of my head for once.
I would really like to go running.
I think about that sometimes.
What it would just feel like to go running.
So see you tomorrow?
Yes.
But if you need anything, just call and I'll come right back.
Okay.
Bye.
I had a really great time today.
Me too.
Bye.
No anesthetic.
You ever donated bone marrow before?
You're a brave guy.
How long have you known Nicholas?
What the hell happened to you?
Hey, how much longer are you gonna stay in my hotel?
Motel.
How much longer?
Actually, I was planning on dying here.
Well, then you need to pay in advance.
Hello?
Hey, it's Emily.
Are you sleeping?
Yes.
No.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
My sister came over for a couple of days last week with the kids and it was really great.
I tried calling you a couple times.
How are you doing?
Yeah, I'm good.
Everything's fine.
I've been...
I've been traveling a lot, so...
Well, are you busy tonight?
What do you mean?
I don't...
Maybe you wanna come by and say hello?
Around 7?
You don't have to if you don't want to.
I just, you know...
Look, I totally get if you don't wanna hang out with the dying girl, so...
I can...
I can come at 7.
Okay.
Okay.
Bye.
- Well, how you doing tonight?
- Hey.
- How you doing?
- Have fun.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Come in.
I am so glad she's gone.
Are you okay if we eat outside?
Eating?
You didn't eat already, did you?
- No.
- Okay.
No.
Well, it was a surprise but you're on time.
I haven't cooked anybody food for years, so you better like it.
Or lie to me.
This is for you.
You don't have to say anything.
I just got it...
Change in there.
Dinner is ready and you're not.
So hurry up.
Chop-chop.
You look great.
Yeah.
It's pink.
It's salmon.
You are so nice.
So are you.
Everything's vegetarian.
I hope you like eggplant Parmesan.
I haven't treated myself very well in the past few years.
Start now.
All right.
What do you think?
It's delicious.
Glad you like it.
Do you wanna hear my favorite song?
Yes.
Are you gonna sing it?
No, I can't sing anymore.
Oh, and a performance.
Oh, no.
Shall we?
You need to relax.
This is relaxed.
I have a surprise for you.
Surprise?
Yes.
For me?
- Keep them closed.
- Okay.
And open.
Okay.
You cleaned The Beast.
Actually, I fixed it.
No, you didn't.
Oh, okay, let's go, then.
Wait.
Are you serious?
Try it.
Okay.
Thank you.
Wait right here, okay?
I'll be right back.
Wait right here.
One second.
Hey!
Tell me what's going on.
- Now!
- All right.
Ben, you need to go home.
Do you know they keep a full history of every inquiry a revenue officer makes?
- You understand?
- Keep your voice down.
- Just keep your voice down.
- No.
What you are doing is a crime!
You are impersonating a federal officer.
It's a felony!
All right.
Listen.
You can't play with people's lives.
Do you understand that?
All right.
All right, there's a coffee shop.
There's a coffee shop near where I'm staying.
- Tomorrow we'll sit down...
- Where are you staying, Tim?
Tell me, because I don't know where my brother lives!
A motel.
Five blocks from here.
We'll sit down tomorrow morning, I guarantee it.
Where are my credentials?
Give me my credentials back.
Here it is.
Here.
Here.
Just go home.
You have a beautiful family.
Go home and enjoy them.
Tim, Tim, Tim, why are you even here?
Tell me, who is Emily Posa?
I'll explain everything tomorrow.
Look, give me your car keys.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm gonna be right here.
So you remember I love you and...
Tim, don't make me come knock on the door, okay?
I didn't realize how late it was and...
I have a really long drive, so I need to go.
I don't wanna keep lying to you.
I don't wanna...
Wait, Emily.
Do you wanna play a game?
What game?
The "what if" game.
The "what if" game.
What if my pager goes off and it's a heart and it works?
And my body doesn't reject it?
And what if I have time?
What if?
What if we have children?
What if we got married?
I love you.
- I love you too.
- I love you.
Hi.
Is Dr. Briar on duty tonight?
She's doing her rounds.
Can you tell her it's Ben Thomas?
It's very important.
- I'Il...
I'll page her.
- Thank you.
Dr. Briar to the nurses' station.
Hey.
- Is it Emily?
- No, no.
I'm sorry.
It's...
Is there?
I'm sorry.
Do you have any more optimism about Emily than you did the other day?
Ben when you're looking for a donor with a rare blood type the odds go way down.
To what?
They go down.
What's the...?
Give me a percentage.
Give me a number.
Three, 5 percent.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I wish the numbers were higher.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- I do.
Hello?
Dan.
It's time.
I love you.
1:38 a.m.
Hello?
Ezra.
My name is Ben Thomas.
I called you a few weeks ago.
You probably don't remember.
I do remember.
I wanna apologize for being so cruel to you but I had to be certain.
I had to be certain that you were a decent man.
Kind.
- Slow to anger.
- What do you want from me?
I wanna give you a gift.
You're gonna be contacted by a man named Dan Morris.
You can trust him.
Was that you at the diner?
Goodbye.
911 emergency.
I need an ambulance.
I have you at 9212 West Third Street in Los Angeles.
Yes, room number 2.
What's the emergency?
There's been a suicide.
Who's the victim?
I am.
You are gonna need to stop looking at that thing so much.
Why?
Is it gonna crack?
Oh, no.
I paid extra for the non-cracking kind.
I bet you did.
- Why don't you just turn that off?
- I know.
No more.
No more work.
I'm done.
Almost done.
Almost done.
Tim!
I have procedures.
I understand, but she needs that heart or she will die.
- Ben?
- One, two, three.
Hey.
How you doing?
About a year after the accident, I got sick.
I got lung cancer, and I needed a double-Iobe transplant.
Tim could only give me one, of course.
It must have planted a seed, because he...
About six months later he donated the right part of his liver to this woman.
Her name is Holly.
I'm proud of you kids.
Very proud.
Good job.
Good job.
- Ezra.
- Yeah.
Hi.
Are you a parent?
No.
Have we met?
You okay?
You must be Emily.
Yes.
It's so nice to meet you.
- ENCODE + SENCRON - ***** CaLLiOPE-_MoNTEDiaZ *****
Okay.
911 emergency.
I need an ambulance.
I have you at 9212 West Third Street in Los Angeles.
Yes, room number 2.
What's the emergency?
There's been a suicide.
Who's the victim?
I am.
In seven days, God created the world.
And in seven seconds I shattered mine.
- I can have four new fillets overnight.
- Oh, no.
No, thank you.
What is your name again?
Ezra?
Is that right?
Yes, sir.
I'll just need your first and last name so I can call up your account.
- You know what?
Here's what I'm thinking, Ezra.
I think I'm gonna mail you the meat back so you can see firsthand the type of dog food that you're peddling.
That won't be necessary, sir.
So how about we just start with your last name?
Thomas.
And don't even get me started on the pork.
- Have you tried the pork?
- Well, no, sir.
I'm not much of a meat eater myself, but I hear really great things about the pork.
- Oh, so you don't eat pork at all?
- No, sir.
Are you Jewish?
Is that why you don't eat pork, Ezra?
Well, can we...?
What's your first name, Mr. Thomas?
Ben.
Hold on, what was that voice?
I don't...
I don't have an order for a Ben Thomas.
Ezra, what was that voice?
- What voice?
- Are you blind?
- Excuse me?
- You're kidding me.
A blind beef salesman who doesn't eat meat.
Now, that...
That is rich.
That is rich.
Have you ever had sex, Ezra?
Did Lawrence in Accounting put you up to this?
Because somehow I can't imagine the blind, vegan beef salesman having sex.
- Listen, I'm trying to help you, sir.
- You're trying to help me?
The blind beef salesman is trying to help me?
I'm actually starting to feel pretty bad for you, Ezra.
Because I look at my life, and it is surrounded by so much beauty and you can't see shit.
Is that fair?
Does that seem fair to you, Ezra?
Do you even know what color the ocean is?
Do you?
- It's blue, sir.
- "It's blue, sir."
Say what you wanna say.
React.
Say what you wanna say to me.
Thank you for calling Cheyenne Meats.
That's not what you wanna say, you coward.
You coward.
You blind, vegan, beef-salesman, virgin coward!
- Goodbye, Mr. Thomas.
- Say what you wanna say.
Ken Anderson.
Nicole Anderson.
Allie Anderson.
Ed Rice.
Steven Phillips.
Monica Freeman.
Sarah Jensen.
Ken Anderson!
Nicole Anderson!
Allie Anderson!
Ed Rice!
Steven Phillips!
Monica Freeman!
And Sarah Jensen!
Hi, can I help you?
Yes.
Hello, I'm looking for Emily.
- You're a friend of hers?
- Yes, ma'am.
- She's not home.
- Oh, goodness.
No, she left this morning.
She had to do some more tests.
She asked me to watch Duke until she got back.
Okay.
You ever try mixing banana peel into the soil?
- Really?
- It works, I swear.
Oh, would you by chance know where I could find her?
Supervisor to 104.
Supervisor to 104.
Cardiac wing?
Take the elevator to the fifth floor then turn left.
Thank you.
Well, that's what I was just saying.
It's absolutely impossible.
Hold the elevator.
Thank you.
Can I help you?
Yes.
Good evening.
I'm here to see Emily Posa.
I'm sorry, visiting hours are from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.
You know, it is really important I speak to her for just a moment.
You'll just have to come back during visiting hours.
Thank you very much.
So if there is one thing that I have learned and you all should remember about winning these contracts:
Three steps.
First, tell them what you're gonna tell them.
Step two, you tell them.
Step three, tell them what you told them.
We are gonna close by reminding them that old girl has a 3-percent better impulse from sea level to vacuum and if they pass on that, quite frankly, they deserve another Sputnik.
Now, if you will excuse me I have a very lovely, very hungry woman at home waiting for me.
Sarah.
Honey.
Everyone at work kept saying it was daylight-savings time.
You were supposed to be here a while ago.
- I kept saying it wasn't.
- This happens all the time.
It's work.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- No, I'm angry with you.
I'm gonna be angry all night long.
- I'm angry with you.
- What are you doing?
How about that?
How about I'm angry with you?
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.
It's your brother.
Where are you?
I'm at the beach house.
Are you okay?
Of course.
Listen, why'd you disconnect the landline?
The phone broke.
I don't need it anymore.
Did I?
Did I do something?
No.
Not unless you're smoking again.
No, I've put on 20 pounds.
I'm in the best shape of my life.
Are you eating?
Are you taking care of yourself?
- You sound terrible again and...
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Look, I gotta go.
Give Melanie and the kids a hug and a kiss.
I'll talk to you later.
You take care of yourself.
Hold on.
I know it's been a while, but when you were staying here you didn't take something of mine by mistake, did you?
I remember giving you something.
You remember that?
Because I remember that very clearly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just remember I love you.
Hi, my name is Ben Thomas.
I'm here to see Stewart Goodman.
Inez, look at me, please.
Inez.
I'm speaking to you.
I understand you refused to take your meds again.
Is that true?
No, no, no.
Let's try using your words this time, okay, Inez?
I mean, this silent treatment isn't doing anybody any good.
Inez, how can we help you if...?
Okay, how about I come back tomorrow and see if you've changed your mind, okay?
Thattagirl.
I thought I was coming to your office today.
I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd stop by, save you the drive.
Terrific.
Well, look, let's go talk in my office, yeah?
Come on.
I take a no-nonsense approach.
I mean, I cut the operating costs of this place over 17 percent last year alone.
- I'm sure that made them happy.
- Oh, hell, yeah.
Now, if I could only get my own finances in that kind of shape, I wouldn't have you sitting here.
No offense.
That your new Beemer out front?
Ben, I mean, when I found out that my bone-marrow transplant wasn't successful...
I'm well aware of your ongoing medical condition.
Things aren't looking very promising for me.
Look I have a bonus coming in January.
I just really need this six-month extension.
Really, I mean, I am doing the very best I can here, I promise you.
I'm gonna show myself out.
I'll be in touch.
Well, thank you.
I appreciate it.
I mean, this way everybody wins, right?
Hello.
My name is Ben.
I totally understand if you don't wanna speak to me either.
But I would really like to just have a moment of your time.
I'm trying to figure out what kind of man Stewart Goodman is.
It is within my power to drastically change his circumstances.
But I don't wanna give that man a gift that he doesn't deserve.
I need you to tell me whether or not he is a good person.
"The drug he gives me makes me dizzy.
I want a new one."
Well, that sounds very reasonable, Inez.
What else?
You can trust me.
What else, Inez?
He's punishing you?
How is he punishing you?
How is he punishing you, Inez?
Ben?
- Hey, Ben, where you going?
- Where's the washroom?
To the right.
Is there a problem?
- Give her a bath, right now.
- Absolutely.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You have the wrong impression here.
I'm gonna stop by from time to time make sure you're showing these people some respect.
Look, this is a misunderstanding, okay?
You don't treat people like that.
Let me explain, okay, Ben?
- And I'm not giving you an extension.
- Ben!
I'm not giving you anything.
I almost believed you, you son of a bitch.
I almost believed.
Okay.
Grip and rip.
This time it's gonna be a lot different.
Hey.
- Hey, Michelle.
- Hey.
- Good to see you.
- You too.
- How are you?
- I'm good.
- Hey, man.
- Hey.
What are you doing here?
Just coming to make sure that she is still kicking your ass at everything.
And I am.
- Can we have a sec, hon?
- Yeah.
All right.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm good.
You said you were gonna call me on the 15th.
- Today is the 19th.
- I know.
Doctor didn't have the results, so I had no information to give you.
Still, you should call me.
- Yeah, I know.
Yes, I know.
- We're still friends.
Right?
Yeah.
I'm just...
I'm doing some soul-searching, you know?
Don't do that.
- We have a plan.
- I know.
- Do what you promised me.
- I will.
You know, they rent clubs up at the clubhouse.
I'm well aware of that.
I think I'm gonna keep my ass unkicked today.
Were you looking at him, or were you looking at me?
Actually, I was just sitting here.
Am I doing it wrong?
I think I saw you in the elevator the other day.
Oh, yes.
Actually, you are being audited.
My name is Ben Thomas.
I'm with the IRS, and you owe the government $56, 240.19.
I know.
And now you get me.
Would you have a seat, please, Miss Posa?
So I've been looking over the income statements from the last three years.
- 2005...
- Were...?
Were you in my room the other night?
No, ma'am, I was not in your room the other night.
That's not exactly IRS protocol.
So I've been looking over '05, '06 and '07.
There seems to be quite a disparity between what you claimed and...
Mr. Thomas?
I just got discharged.
So, you know, unless you're gonna, like haul me off to some IRS jail or something I'd really like to get home now.
- Oh, sure.
No problem.
- Okay.
I'll be in touch.
Welcome to the Travel Inn.
Can I help you?
I need a room.
How many hours?
About two weeks.
Clear it!
That's it, that's it!
All right, come on!
Vamos, Manny!
All right, all right.
That's it, that's it.
Hey!
- What you want?
- Break it up!
- You want some of this?
- Get off!
Get off!
Hey, Rico, knock it off!
Somebody wanna remind Rico where we are?
The sanctuary, coach!
- I can't hear you.
- The sanctuary, coach!
That's right, Rico, in the sanctuary.
Now give me 20 starts and stops.
Hello, this is Emily Posa.
I'm not home right now, but please leave a message and I'll call you back as soon as possible.
Thank you.
Hi, my name is Susan Nall.
I'm calling because a friend told me you do letterpress invitations, and I was wondering...
Hello?
Hi, this is Emily.
Yep, I do wedding invitations.
I'm not able to take any requests, though, right now.
I know someone nearby who does it.
She's not as good as I am, but her prices are very...
Hello?
Duke?
Duke.
We're out here.
Hello, Miss Posa.
What are you doing here?
Oh, I came to see you.
Don't you people ever call ahead?
You people tend to try to hide things.
Is that meat?
No!
No, no.
No.
No meat.
No.
- Well, he was really enjoying it.
- He eats steamed broccoli and tofu.
- Why?
- He's a vegetarian.
- He is a vegetarian?
- Yes.
Well, that sucks.
Hey, can we talk?
Do you have a moment?
No.
Actually, I have to take Duke for a walk.
No problem.
I'll go with you, if you don't mind.
- So...
- Hey, hey.
Hey.
So I've been looking over 2005, 2006 and 2007.
Now...
I'm listening.
- Can I get him for you?
- Nope.
I got him.
Let me get him.
Let me get him.
Let me get him.
- You all right?
- Yes.
Whoa, sorry.
Whoa, not these.
- That's okay.
Watch...
- No, no.
Heel, heel, heel.
Yeah, maybe we shouldn't feed him meat.
So I've been looking over...
- Yeah, maybe we can do this later.
- Yeah.
So you cook it all ahead of time, I see.
No, actually.
I can't remember the last time I cooked.
This is my sister's way of looking out for me from afar.
Do you have any siblings?
Yes, one brother.
He's a...
He's a good egg.
Yeah, I just have the one sister too.
Are you receiving income from any source that the government is currently unaware of?
Well, lately I've been taking to diving in local wishing wells, so...
I mean, but it's just occasional dimes here and there or, once in a while, a quarter.
No, actually I had to refinance this place to pay my past-due medical bills.
I've been informed that you suffer from congenital heart failure.
Yes.
Did you gather that while stalking me at the hospital?
No, I...
You're currently Status 2, which means you're sick enough to be on the national UNOS waiting list but not sick enough to be admitted into the hospital and placed on Status 1.
So basically, if your heart starts to fail quickly and no donor can be located you're screwed.
Is it true that you said that you do not believe that you even deserve a heart because your life is unremarkable in every way?
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I said that.
I'm sorry.
Do you have to take any type of sensitivity training to join the IRS, Mr. Thomas?
- No, not really.
- Yeah.
So you don't consider yourself a good person?
How would you answer that question if I asked you the same?
"Unremarkable" would be an upgrade for me I assure you.
I'm gonna freeze your accounts as uncollectible until further notice.
I'm sure that'll buy you five or six months, penalty-free.
Here's my card.
If anyone from the IRS tries to contact you you call me immediately.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay.
- Mr. Thomas?
- Yes.
Why do I get the feeling you're doing me a really big favor right now?
Because I get the feeling that you really deserve it.
All right?
You off to?
You off to pollute someone else's dog now?
No.
Just going home.
Where's that?
Take care, Emily.
You too.
- What is this thing for?
- I told you already.
And why are you bringing a fish into your room?
Because it's my room.
And I don't want anyone going into my room, understood?
Well, I don't think you can keep a fish in your room.
I think I can.
Well, I've never had anybody who kept a fish in their room.
Now you do.
Who?
Good night.
The first time I ever saw a box jellyfish I was 12.
Our father took us to the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
I never forgot when he said that it was the most deadly creature on earth.
To me it was just the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.
I spoke to the doctor again.
He's gonna send over your files in the morning.
- Is this everything?
- Yeah.
- Any questions?
- Same one.
Well, same answer, then.
You know, I was thinking last night about when we were 14 and we made our big pact.
You remember on the beach in front of your grandparents' house we agreed that we would never, never date each other's girls?
I remembered that that night you told me how much you liked Stacy Miller and that you were gonna ask her out.
And I said:
"Hey, man.
You can't.
Her and I already did it."
Which we didn't, but I wanted to but she liked you way more than she liked me, and...
So I lied to you because I was so jealous.
And I realized that I've been carrying around this lie in my heart for the last 25...
Stop it!
Stop it.
Stay focused.
Do what you promised me.
- What, you think I'm...?
- Do what you promised me.
You think I'm gonna let you down now, don't you?
I've known you my whole damn life!
Okay?
This?
This?
This is not something you do every day.
Okay?
This is...
This is not easy for me.
I'll make sure everything goes as planned.
Don't worry.
Thank you.
Oh, my God.
Hello, Holly.
Look at you.
- What are you doing here?
- I came to see you.
- Really?
- You have a minute?
Sure.
Come on in.
Here's my desk.
Have a seat.
You look great.
- I do?
- Yes.
I feel great.
- How are you?
- I'm really good.
I need a favor.
Whatever you need, just ask me.
I need a name.
Someone in the system.
Someone having a really hard time that needs help, but may be too proud to ask for a handout.
What are you doing?
I'm helping.
I need a name.
Okay.
Connie Tepos.
Her boyfriend almost killed her last year when she tried to leave.
He broke three of her ribs last month.
She's scared to death to press charges and we can't do anything.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Connie Tepos?
- Yes?
My name is Ben Thomas.
I'm with the IRS.
IRS?
But I always pay my taxes.
Yes, this is more of a general inquiry.
I don't understand.
What...?
May I come in?
Not now.
My boyfriend is not here.
It's very important for your family.
For my family?
Beautiful.
Please, have a seat.
What's this all about?
Your case has come to my attention.
And I wanted to get to know you.
You wanted to get to know me?
Why?
Because I'd like to help you.
I don't understand.
I'm aware of your case.
And your boyfriend.
What are you talking about?
You know what I'm talking about.
No, I have no idea what you're talking about.
Kids, go to your room.
He's coming back?
He's not coming back.
You said you were from the IRS, but you're lying to me.
- No.
- You're not telling me the truth.
Who sent you here?
Please sit down.
I'm not going to sit down.
- Please, calm down.
- I'm not going to calm down.
You come into my house.
You talking to me about mi caso y mi boyfriend?
- Who sent you here?
- Nobody.
Nobody?
Get out of my house immediately.
You can trust me.
I trust no one, Mr. Thomas.
I talked to Holly.
I can get you out of here.
To a safe place.
A beautiful place.
Why did you talk to Holly?
Your children are in danger here.
Don't talk about my kids, Mr. Thomas.
- You don't know.
- You don't have to live like this.
Get out of my house now or I'm gonna call the police.
- Okay, okay.
- Who are you?
- I want you to take my card.
- I don't need help.
I want you to take my card, and call me...
- I don't need it.
- I'm gonna leave it.
Okay.
Thank you.
Get out right now.
- You're not helpless.
- Can you leave?
This is my house.
Please, just think about it.
I don't need you.
- I can't talk right now.
- I need to talk immediately.
- Where are you?
- I'm nowhere.
I'm gonna meet you at the house.
Look, no.
I'm not at the house.
I'm traveling.
I'll talk to you next week.
No, no, no.
We need to discuss this right now.
Wouldn't wanna get on her bad side.
- I'll sign to that.
- Yeah.
How you doing, you two?
I'm good.
Got a big day.
Yep.
No more dialysis, George.
See you in the O.R.
Yep.
- I'll see you there as well.
- Yes, sir.
Thank you.
So I heard you raised enough money to give a couple of the kids partial scholarships to college.
It's no big deal.
I just convinced a couple of bigwig donors that what the world really needs to see is more Latinos on ice.
You know, Ben, I keep asking you this but why me?
Because you are a good man.
No, really.
Even when you don't know that people are watching you.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Okay, I can't hear you, so try back again.
Gonna hang up now.
Bye.
Mr. Thomas?
We're ready for you.
These are beautiful.
Banana peels.
Who knew?
Emily?
Can I get a refill?
- Susan?
- Yeah.
How's Ryan?
He's good.
He's at his dad's this weekend.
Will you tell him for me that I'm ready whenever he is for a free lesson?
Yeah, all right.
Things are kind of crazy right now with school but maybe when school's out.
Oh, yeah.
That's perfect.
How's the pie?
Oh, it's...
It's good.
You gonna ask her out?
The waitress.
No.
You never know.
I don't...
I don't think she sees me.
Good night, Ezra.
Hello?
Ben?
Hi, I'm sorry to call so late.
Did...?
Did someone from the IRS contact you?
No.
I just...
I was having trouble breathing after I took Duke for a walk, and I fainted.
An ambulance had to take me to the hospital.
I'm so sorry.
I don't know why I even called you.
I'm sorry.
It's just that I have your card with me, and...
Ben?
Are you still there?
Yes.
Do you ever think about dying, Ben?
Every now and again.
My face is bluish.
It's not exactly a good sign.
You should try to rest.
Just...
Why don't you see if you can get some sleep?
I like talking to you.
I like talking to you too.
Would you tell me a story, please?
Okay.
All right.
Once upon a time there was a little boy named...
Oh, lucky me, you just got it on reserve like that.
Okay.
Let me guess.
His name was Ben.
No, actually, this little boy's name is Tim.
I like the name Tim.
Go on.
Tim's little brother was always pestering Tim to make him paper airplanes, because he was really good at it.
But Tim had much bigger dreams than that.
Okay.
Then what happened?
One day, Tim went out to the backyard and he put leaves and taped branches to his arms and started climbing the big oak tree.
His little brother said, "Tim, you can't fly."
And he said, "Yeah?
You just watch."
He got all the way to the top and jumped.
How tall was this tree?
It was...
It was pretty tall.
He broke his arm.
Oh, my God...
This is a horrible story.
Oh, no, no.
It gets better.
From that experience, Tim realized that he wanted to fly.
So he dedicated his life to making spaceships.
I thought you said this was a good story.
Oh, well...
Yeah, that is until the dragons showed up.
Oh, okay, see, now it's getting better.
I like dragons.
Especially dragons in space.
Yes, and these were fire-breathing space dragons with really bad attitudes.
I see.
I have an idea.
Why don't you try to fall asleep and when you do, I'll just hang up.
Okay.
Ben?
Yes.
Thank you for listening.
And for talking.
Try to fall asleep.
Good night, Ben.
Good night, Emily.
Emily?
Emily?
I lied to you.
I think about dying every day.
Dr. King to NICU.
Dr. Wesley King, please report to NICU.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
When did you get here?
Last night, after we talked.
You slept here?
Good morning.
How's our patient?
- Morning.
Better.
- Good.
- Hello.
- Hi, Ben.
Is that right?
IRS?
- Yes, how are you?
- Good, thank you.
- I'll leave you two alone.
- No, no, stay, please.
Don't go.
He can...
He can stay.
Whatever you want.
You fainted because your heart was too weak to pump enough blood to your brain.
It's enlarged and it's starting to shut down.
How long?
It's entirely up to your heart.
Could be six weeks, could be a month.
But we've upped you to Status 1 B.
At least I'm on the list.
Not only that, but we're giving you this pager.
And when it goes off, it means you have a donor.
The inotrope drug I started you on it's gonna stabilize your blood pressure within 24 hours.
Then what?
We wait.
- Can I do that at home?
- Once you're stable, you can.
Okay.
I'm gonna run to the cafeteria.
I'm gonna get you something.
If you want something else, I can get you something else.
Would you stay?
I mean, unless you have something else to do.
- I'd really like it if you stayed.
- I don't have anything.
Okay.
Okay.
Hey, hey, hey.
What the hell is that thing?
It's a dog.
Just for one night.
No.
Hold on, hold on.
I don't give two shits, okay?
We have a dog policy here.
Little dogs only.
Poodles and Shih Tzus.
It's in the contract.
It's English and Spanish for everyone to see.
And besides, that, my friend, is not a dog.
It's a goddamn horse.
Well, let me know when you add a horse policy to the contract.
Yes.
Mr. Thomas, it's Connie Tepos.
Hey, Connie.
I don't know why I'm calling you but I'm calling you.
You said you could help us and...
Can you really help us?
This just doesn't make any sense.
- What if he finds us?
- He won't.
- What makes you so sure?
- Stop it.
- You don't know him.
- Stop it.
Don't be weak.
- Don't be weak.
- I'm not weak.
I'm strong.
Take this.
Take it.
You are gonna start this car and you're gonna go.
This is real, and this is gonna be your new life.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
Look at those babies.
Look at those babies.
Look how beautiful those babies are.
I know, I know.
They deserve it.
Okay?
You're headed north up the coast.
Lorena.
Lorena.
I've always believed this place can heal the soul.
Mommy, the ocean.
Yes, the ocean.
I hope that proves true for you.
When you sign your name on the dotted line of the contract you'll own my house outright.
I only ask that you never mention how you got the house or try to contact me for any reason.
And if you're wondering why you, please stop.
All I ask is for you to honor my wishes and, of course, live life abundantly.
Hey.
Thanks.
Got it.
Hi, Duke.
Hi, baby.
What time does the nurse come?
She should be there by the time I get home.
- Ben?
- Yes.
I know I'm the girl with the broken wing.
But who are you?
Who am I?
I am your friendly neighborhood tax collector.
Ben.
Where the hell did you come from?
I grew up in Oakland.
Literally.
Okay.
Where did you go to college?
As far from Oakland as possible.
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
How about you?
UCLA.
You went to MIT?
Like, the MIT?
Oh, and now you're wondering how I wound up as a lowly tax collector.
Absolutely.
- I sort of stumbled into this job.
- That's a big stumble.
What from?
I always wanted to be an engineer.
An engineer?
What kind?
The kind that sent people to the moon.
Really?
Yes.
I don't wanna talk about me anymore.
That's too bad, because you're very interesting.
Have you...?
Have you ever been in love?
Emily, please.
Yes, you have.
Come on, you can tell me.
Yes.
But it ended.
- What happened?
- Stop it.
- No, seriously, you can tell...
- Stop it.
You need to get some rest.
I'll call you tomorrow, or maybe I'll stop by.
No, if I have questions tomorrow, what then?
That's not a part of the deal.
What the hell does that mean?
Emily, hold on.
Hold on.
- Just leave.
- Emily, wait.
Wait!
Thank you for everything you did.
Did you like the eggs?
They were okay, I guess.
I don't like the eggs you buy.
Okay.
You're wearing suit pants.
To weed.
Yeah, I didn't...
I didn't have any other clothes with me.
- You know, I was gonna get to those.
- I saw them the other day.
I figured I would just take the day off and get this done for you.
Ben?
Yeah?
This is a really ridiculous apology.
Come on.
I wanna show you something.
Oh, no, I gotta finish.
You can finish tomorrow.
Come on.
This is where I used to work.
And these are the artifacts of said work.
Wow, those are great.
How old are they?
This one is just shy of 120 years.
It's how I put out my line of letterpress cards, wedding invitations, invites.
What about this one?
That youngster is the Heidelberg Windmill, 1956.
Call it "The Beast."
Well, that seems appropriate.
It pooped out on me about five years ago, though.
And I can't find anybody to fix it.
It's kind of a dying art.
Defibrillator here works, though.
Luckily.
It kept my business afloat.
Wanna see how?
Please.
Okay.
Now, true pressmen hate that we modern girls want a deep impression.
See, for a hundred years, they tried their damnedest just to kiss it so that it didn't leave an indentation.
Now it's the only way to prove it's not digital.
I think it feels richer.
You okay?
Yeah.
Look, Ben...
I don't really know anything about you or where you came from but you keep showing up.
And I'm glad.
Okay.
Okay.
So Duke needs a walk.
Are you interested?
Yes.
Come on.
Hey, hey.
Right here.
There you go.
He's like a different dog with you around.
I don't think we ever properly bonded.
Why would you get such a big dog?
Did you know that Great Danes on average only live about seven years?
They have heart issues.
I think I got him because I thought he could help me with my illness.
It'd be something I could take care of as opposed to being always taken care of.
You know, just so you know, I used to be really hot.
Like, unauditably hot.
Is that so?
Yeah.
I haven't felt like this in a really long time.
There's so many things that I wanna do.
I wanna go on a plane for 13 hours and not have to stress that I can't reach my doctor.
You know, like, just travel.
Go backpacking, have experiences.
See the world.
I just wanna have the time to figure out who it is that I am.
You know, what I like.
Do things, try things, get out of my head for once.
I would really like to go running.
I think about that sometimes.
What it would just feel like to go running.
So see you tomorrow?
Yes.
But if you need anything, just call and I'll come right back.
Okay.
Bye.
I had a really great time today.
Me too.
Bye.
No anesthetic.
You ever donated bone marrow before?
You're a brave guy.
How long have you known Nicholas?
What the hell happened to you?
Hey, how much longer are you gonna stay in my hotel?
Motel.
How much longer?
Actually, I was planning on dying here.
Well, then you need to pay in advance.
Hello?
Hey, it's Emily.
Are you sleeping?
Yes.
No.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
My sister came over for a couple of days last week with the kids and it was really great.
I tried calling you a couple times.
How are you doing?
Yeah, I'm good.
Everything's fine.
I've been...
I've been traveling a lot, so...
Well, are you busy tonight?
What do you mean?
I don't...
Maybe you wanna come by and say hello?
Around 7?
You don't have to if you don't want to.
I just, you know...
Look, I totally get if you don't wanna hang out with the dying girl, so...
I can...
I can come at 7.
Okay.
Okay.
Bye.
- Well, how you doing tonight?
- Hey.
- How you doing?
- Have fun.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Come in.
I am so glad she's gone.
Are you okay if we eat outside?
Eating?
You didn't eat already, did you?
- No.
- Okay.
No.
Well, it was a surprise but you're on time.
I haven't cooked anybody food for years, so you better like it.
Or lie to me.
This is for you.
You don't have to say anything.
I just got it...
Change in there.
Dinner is ready and you're not.
So hurry up.
Chop-chop.
You look great.
Yeah.
It's pink.
It's salmon.
You are so nice.

About a year after the accident, I got sick.
I got lung cancer, and I needed a double-lobe transplant.

About six months later he donated the right part of his liver to this woman.
Her name is Holly.

You'll just have to come back during visiting hours.
Thank you very much.
So if there is one thing that i have learned and you all should remember about winning these contracts:
Three steps.
First, tell them what you're gonna tell them.
Step two, you tell them.
Step three, tell them what you told them.
We are gonna close by reminding them that old girl has a 3-percent better impulse from sea level to vacuum and if they pass on that, quite frankly, they deserve another sputnik.
Now, if you will excuse me i have a very lovely, very hungry woman at home waiting for me.
Sarah.
Honey.
Everyone at work kept saying it was daylight-savings time.
You were supposed to be here a while ago.
- I kept saying it wasn't.

It's work.

Look, i gotta go.
Give melanie and the kids a hug and a kiss.
I'll talk to you later.
You take care of yourself.
Hold on.
I know it's been a while, but when you were staying here you didn't take something of mine by mistake, did you?
I remember giving you something.
You remember that?
Because i remember that very clearly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just remember i love you.
Hi, my name is ben thomas.
I'm here to see stewart goodman.
Inez, look at me, please.
Inez.
I'm speaking to you.
I understand you refused to take your meds again.
Is that true?
No, no, no.
Let's try using your words this time, okay, inez?
I mean, this silent treatment isn't doing anybody any good.
Inez, how can we help you if...?
Okay, how about i come back tomorrow and see if you've changed your mind, okay?
Thattagirl.
I thought i was coming to your office today.
I was in the neighborhood.
I thought i'd stop by, save you the drive.
Terrific.
Well, look, let's go talk in my office, yeah?
Come on.
I take a no-nonsense approach.
I mean, i cut the operating costs of this place over 17 percent last year alone.
- I'm sure that made them happy.
- Oh, hell, yeah.
Now, if i could only get my own finances in that kind of shape, i wouldn't have you sitting here.
No offense.
That your new beemer out front?
Ben, i mean, when i found out that my bone-marrow transplant wasn't successful... i'm well aware of your ongoing medical condition.
Things aren't looking very promising for me.
Look i have a bonus coming in january.
I just really need this six-month extension.
Really, i mean, i am doing the very best i can here, i promise you.
I'm gonna show myself out.
I'll be in touch.
Well, thank you.
I appreciate it.
I mean, this way everybody wins, right?
Hello.
My name is ben.
I totally understand if you don't wanna speak to me either.
But i would really like to just have a moment of your time.
I'm trying to figure out what kind of man stewart goodman is.
It is within my power to drastically change his circumstances.
But i don't wanna give that man a gift that he doesn't deserve.
I need you to tell me whether or not he is a good person.
"The drug he gives me makes me dizzy.
I want a new one."
Well, that sounds very reasonable, inez.
What else?
You can trust me.
What else, inez?
He's punishing you?
How is he punishing you?
How is he punishing you, inez?
Ben?
- Hey, ben, where you going?
- Where's the washroom?
To the right.
Is there a problem?
- Give her a bath, right now.
- Absolutely.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You have the wrong impression here.
I'm gonna stop by from time to time make sure you're showing these people some respect.
Look, this is a misunderstanding, okay?
You don't treat people like that.
Let me explain, okay, ben?
- And i'm not giving you an extension.
- Ben!
I'm not giving you anything.
I almost believed you, you son of a bitch.
I almost believed.
Okay.
Grip and rip.
This time it's gonna be a lot different.
Hey.

Don't do that.

- I will.
You know, they rent clubs up at the clubhouse.
I'm well aware of that.
I think i'm gonna keep my ass unkicked today.
Were you looking at him, or were you looking at me?
Actually, i was just sitting here.
Am i doing it wrong?
I think i saw you in the elevator the other day.
Oh, yes.

Yeah, i just have the one sister too.
Are you receiving income from any source that the government is currently unaware of?
Well, lately i've been taking to diving in local wishing wells, so... i mean, but it's just occasional dimes here and there or, once in a while, a quarter.
No, actually i had to refinance this place to pay my past-due medical bills.
I've been informed that you suffer from congenital heart failure.
Yes.
Did you gather that while stalking me at the hospital?
No, i... you're currently status 2, which means you're sick enough to be on the national unos waiting list but not sick enough to be admitted into the hospital and placed on status 1.
So basically, if your heart starts to fail quickly and no donor can be located you're screwed.
Is it true that you said that you do not believe that you even deserve a heart because your life is unremarkable in every way?
I'm sorry.
I don't know why i said that.
I'm sorry.
Do you have to take any type of sensitivity training to join the irs, mr.
Thomas?
- No, not really.
- Yeah.
So you don't consider yourself a good person?
How would you answer that question if i asked you the same?
"Unremarkable" would be an upgrade for me i assure you.
I'm gonna freeze your accounts as uncollectible until further notice.
I'm sure that'll buy you five or six months, penalty-free.
Here's my card.
If anyone from the irs tries to contact you you call me immediately.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay.
- Mr. Thomas?
- Yes.
Why do i get the feeling you're doing me a really big favor right now?
Because i get the feeling that you really deserve it.
All right?
You off to?
You off to pollute someone else's dog now?
No.
Just going home.
Where's that?
Take care, emily.
You too.
- What is this thing for?
- I told you already.
And why are you bringing a fish into your room?
Because it's my room.
And i don't want anyone going into my room, understood?
Well, i don't think you can keep a fish in your room.
I think i can.
Well, i've never had anybody who kept a fish in their room.
Now you do.
Who?
Good night.
The first time i ever saw a box jellyfish i was 12.
Our father took us to the monterey bay aquarium.
I never forgot when he said that it was the most deadly creature on earth.
To me it was just the most beautiful thing i'd ever seen.
I spoke to the doctor again.
He's gonna send over your files in the morning.
- Is this everything?
- Yeah.
- Any questions?
- Same one.
Well, same answer, then.
You know, i was thinking last night about when we were 14 and we made our big pact.
You remember on the beach in front of your grandparents' house we agreed that we would never, never date each other's girls?
I remembered that that night you told me how much you liked stacy miller and that you were gonna ask her out.
And i said:
"Hey, man.
You can't.
Her and i already did it."
Which we didn't, but i wanted to but she liked you way more than she liked me, and... so i lied to you because i was so jealous.
And i realized that i've been carrying around this lie in my heart for the last 25... stop it!
Stop it.
Stay focused.
Do what you promised me.
- What, you think i'm...?
- Do what you promised me.
You think i'm gonna let you down now, don't you?
I've known you my whole damn life!
Okay?
This?
This?
This is not something you do every day.
Okay?
This is...
this is not easy for me.
I'll make sure everything goes as planned.
Don't worry.
Thank you.
Oh, my god.
Hello, holly.
Look at you.
- What are you doing here?
- I came to see you.
- Really?
- You have a minute?
Sure.
Come on in.
Here's my desk.
Have a seat.
You look great.
- I do?
- Yes.
I feel great.
- How are you?
- I'm really good.
I need a favor.
Whatever you need, just ask me.
I need a name.
Someone in the system.
Someone having a really hard time that needs help, but may be too proud to ask for a handout.
What are you doing?
I'm helping.
I need a name.
Okay.
Connie tepos.
Her boyfriend almost killed her last year when she tried to leave.
He broke three of her ribs last month.
She's scared to death to press charges and we can't do anything.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Connie tepos?
- Yes?
My name is ben thomas.
I'm with the irs.
Irs?
But i always pay my taxes.
Yes, this is more of a general inquiry.
I don't understand.
What...?
May i come in?
Not now.
My boyfriend is not here.
It's very important for your family.
For my family?
Beautiful.
Please, have a seat.
What's this all about?
Your case has come to my attention.
And i wanted to get to know you.
You wanted to get to know me?
Why?
Because i'd like to help you.
I don't understand.
I'm aware of your case.
And your boyfriend.
What are you talking about?
You know what i'm talking about.
No, i have no idea what you're talking about.
Kids, go to your room.
He's coming back?
He's not coming back.
You said you were from the irs, but you're lying to me.
- No.
- You're not telling me the truth.
Who sent you here?
Please sit down.
I'm not going to sit down.
- Please, calm down.
- I'm not going to calm down.
You come into my house.
You talking to me about mi caso y mi boyfriend?
- Who sent you here?
- Nobody.
Nobody?
Get out of my house immediately.
You can trust me.
I trust no one, mr.
Thomas.
I talked to holly.
I can get you out of here.
To a safe place.
A beautiful place.
Why did you talk to holly?
Your children are in danger here.
Don't talk about my kids, mr.
Thomas.
- You don't know.
- You don't have to live like this.
Get out of my house now or i'm gonna call the police.
- Okay, okay.
- Who are you?
- I want you to take my card.
- I don't need help.
I want you to take my card, and call me...
- i don't need it.
- I'm gonna leave it.
Okay.
Thank you.
Get out right now.
- You're not helpless.
- Can you leave?
This is my house.
Please, just think about it.
I don't need you.
- I can't talk right now.
- I need to talk immediately.
- Where are you?
- I'm nowhere.
I'm gonna meet you at the house.
Look, no.
I'm not at the house.
I'm traveling.
I'll talk to you next week.
No, no, no.
We need to discuss this right now.
Wouldn't wanna get on her bad side.
- I'll sign to that.
- Yeah.
How you doing, you two?
I'm good.
Got a big day.
Yep.
No more dialysis, george.
See you in the o.r.
Yep.
- I'll see you there as well.
- Yes, sir.
Thank you.
So i heard you raised enough money to give a couple of the kids partial scholarships to college.
It's no big deal.
I just convinced a couple of bigwig donors that what the world really needs to see is more latinos on ice.
You know, ben, i keep asking you this but why me?
Because you are a good man.
No, really.
Even when you don't know that people are watching you.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Okay, i can't hear you, so try back again.
Gonna hang up now.
Bye.
Mr. Thomas?
We're ready for you.
These are beautiful.
Banana peels.
Who knew?
Emily?
Can i get a refill?
- Susan?
- Yeah.
How's ryan?
He's good.
He's at his dad's this weekend.
Will you tell him for me that i'm ready whenever he is for a free lesson?
Yeah, all right.
Things are kind of crazy right now with school but maybe when school's out.
Oh, yeah.
That's perfect.
How's the pie?
Oh, it's... it's good.
You gonna ask her out?
The waitress.
No.
You never know.
I don't... i don't think she sees me.
Good night, ezra.
Hello?
Ben?
Hi, i'm sorry to call so late.
Did...?
Did someone from the irs contact you?
No.
I just... i was having trouble breathing after i took duke for a walk, and i fainted.
An ambulance had to take me to the hospital.
I'm so sorry.
I don't know why i even called you.
I'm sorry.
It's just that i have your card with me, and... ben?
Are you still there?
Yes.
Do you ever think about dying, ben?
Every now and again.
My face is bluish.
It's not exactly a good sign.
You should try to rest.
Just... why don't you see if you can get some sleep?
I like talking to you.
I like talking to you too.
Would you tell me a story, please?
Okay.
All right.
Once upon a time there was a little boy named... oh, lucky me, you just got it on reserve like that.
Okay.
Let me guess.
His name was ben.
No, actually, this little boy's name is tim.
I like the name tim.
Go on.
Tim's little brother was always pestering tim to make him paper airplanes, because he was really good at it.
But tim had much bigger dreams than that.
Okay.
Then what happened?
One day, tim went out to the backyard and he put leaves and taped branches to his arms and started climbing the big oak tree.
His little brother said, "tim, you can't fly."
And he said, "yeah?
You just watch."
He got all the way to the top and jumped.
How tall was this tree?
It was... it was pretty tall.
He broke his arm.
Oh, my god...
this is a horrible story.
Oh, no, no.
It gets better.
From that experience, tim realized that he wanted to fly.
So he dedicated his life to making spaceships.
I thought you said this was a good story.
Oh, well... yeah, that is until the dragons showed up.
Oh, okay, see, now it's getting better.
I like dragons.
Especially dragons in space.
Yes, and these were fire-breathing space dragons with really bad attitudes.
I see.
I have an idea.
Why don't you try to fall asleep and when you do, i'll just hang up.
Okay.
Ben?
Yes.
Thank you for listening.
And for talking.
Try to fall asleep.
Good night, ben.
Good night, emily.
Emily?
Emily?
I lied to you.
I think about dying every day.
Dr. King to nicu.
Dr. Wesley king, please report to nicu.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
When did you get here?
Last night, after we talked.
You slept here?
Good morning.
How's our patient?
- Morning.
Better.
- Good.
- Hello.
- Hi, ben.
Is that right?
Irs?
- Yes, how are you?
- Good, thank you.
- I'll leave you two alone.
- No, no, stay, please.
Don't go.
He can... he can stay.
Whatever you want.
You fainted because your heart was too weak to pump enough blood to your brain.
It's enlarged and it's starting to shut down.
How long?
It's entirely up to your heart.
Could be six weeks, could be a month.
But we've upped you to status 1 b.
At least i'm on the list.
Not only that, but we're giving you this pager.
And when it goes off, it means you have a donor.
The inotrope drug i started you on it's gonna stabilize your blood pressure within 24 hours.
Then what?
We wait.
- Can i do that at home?
- Once you're stable, you can.
Okay.
I'm gonna run to the cafeteria.
I'm gonna get you something.
If you want something else, i can get you something else.
Would you stay?
I mean, unless you have something else to do.
- I'd really like it if you stayed.
- I don't have anything.
Okay.
Okay.
Hey, hey, hey.
What the hell is that thing?
It's a dog.
Just for one night.
No.
Hold on, hold on.
I don't give two shits, okay?
We have a dog policy here.
Little dogs only.
Poodles and shih tzus.
It's in the contract.
It's english and spanish for everyone to see.
And besides, that, my friend, is not a dog.
It's a goddamn horse.
Well, let me know when you add a horse policy to the contract.
Yes.
Mr. Thomas, it's connie tepos.
Hey, connie.
I don't know why i'm calling you but i'm calling you.
You said you could help us and... can you really help us?
This just doesn't make any sense.
- What if he finds us?
- He won't.
- What makes you so sure?
- Stop it.
- You don't know him.
- Stop it.
Don't be weak.
- Don't be weak.
- I'm not weak.
I'm strong.
Take this.
Take it.
You are gonna start this car and you're gonna go.
This is real, and this is gonna be your new life.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
Look at those babies.
Look at those babies.
Look how beautiful those babies are.
I know, i know.
They deserve it.
Okay?
You're headed north up the coast.
Lorena.
Lorena.
I've always believed this place can heal the soul.
Mommy, the ocean.
Yes, the ocean.
I hope that proves true for you.
When you sign your name on the dotted line of the contract you'll own my house outright.
I only ask that you never mention how you got the house or try to contact me for any reason.
And if you're wondering why you, please stop.
All i ask is for you to honor my wishes and, of course, live life abundantly.
Hey.
Thanks.
Got it.
Hi, duke.
Hi, baby.
What time does the nurse come?
She should be there by the time i get home.
- Ben?
- Yes.
I know i'm the girl with the broken wing.
But who are you?
Who am i?
I am your friendly neighborhood tax collector.
Ben.
Where the hell did you come from?
I grew up in oakland.
Literally.
Okay.
Where did you go to college?
As far from oakland as possible.
Massachusetts institute of technology.
How about you?
Ucla.
You went to mit?
Like, the mit?
Oh, and now you're wondering how i wound up as a lowly tax collector.
Absolutely.
- I sort of stumbled into this job.
- That's a big stumble.
What from?
I always wanted to be an engineer.
An engineer?
What kind?
The kind that sent people to the moon.
Really?
Yes.
I don't wanna talk about me anymore.
That's too bad, because you're very interesting.
Have you...?
Have you ever been in love?
Emily, please.
Yes, you have.
Come on, you can tell me.
Yes.
But it ended.
- What happened?
- Stop it.
- No, seriously, you can tell...
- stop it.
You need to get some rest.
I'll call you tomorrow, or maybe i'll stop by.
No, if i have questions tomorrow, what then?
That's not a part of the deal.
What the hell does that mean?
Emily, hold on.
Hold on.
- Just leave.
- Emily, wait.
Wait!
Thank you for everything you did.
Did you like the eggs?
They were okay, i guess.
I don't like the eggs you buy.
Okay.
You're wearing suit pants.
To weed.
Yeah, i didn't... i didn't have any other clothes with me.
- You know, i was gonna get to those.
- I saw them the other day.
I figured i would just take the day off and get this done for you.
Ben?
Yeah?
This is a really ridiculous apology.
Come on.
I wanna show you something.
Oh, no, i gotta finish.
You can finish tomorrow.
Come on.
This is where i used to work.
And these are the artifacts of said work.
Wow, those are great.
How old are they?
This one is just shy of 120 years.
It's how i put out my line of letterpress cards, wedding invitations, invites.
What about this one?
That youngster is the heidelberg windmill, 1956.
Call it "the beast."
Well, that seems appropriate.
It pooped out on me about five years ago, though.
And i can't find anybody to fix it.
It's kind of a dying art.
Defibrillator here works, though.
Luckily.
It kept my business afloat.
Wanna see how?
Please.
Okay.
Now, true pressmen hate that we modern girls want a deep impression.
See, for a hundred years, they tried their damnedest just to kiss it so that it didn't leave an indentation.
Now it's the only way to prove it's not digital.
I think it feels richer.
You okay?
Yeah.
Look, ben... i don't really know anything about you or where you came from but you keep showing up.
And i'm glad.
Okay.
Okay.
So duke needs a walk.
Are you interested?
Yes.
Come on.
Hey, hey.
Right here.
There you go.
He's like a different dog with you around.
I don't think we ever properly bonded.
Why would you get such a big dog?
Did you know that great danes on average only live about seven years?
They have heart issues.
I think i got him because i thought he could help me with my illness.
It'd be something i could take care of as opposed to being always taken care of.
You know, just so you know, i used to be really hot.
Like, unauditably hot.
Is that so?
Yeah.
I haven't felt like this in a really long time.
There's so many things that i wanna do.
I wanna go on a plane for 13 hours and not have to stress that i can't reach my doctor.
You know, like, just travel.
Go backpacking, have experiences.
See the world.
I just wanna have the time to figure out who it is that i am.
You know, what i like.
Do things, try things, get out of my head for once.
I would really like to go running.
I think about that sometimes.
What it would just feel like to go running.
So see you tomorrow?
Yes.
But if you need anything, just call and i'll come right back.
Okay.
Bye.
I had a really great time today.
Me too.
Bye.
No anesthetic.
You ever donated bone marrow before?
You're a brave guy.
How long have you known nicholas?
What the hell happened to you?
Hey, how much longer are you gonna stay in my hotel?
Motel.
How much longer?
Actually, i was planning on dying here.
Well, then you need to pay in advance.
Hello?
Hey, it's emily.
Are you sleeping?
Yes.
No.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, i'm fine.
My sister came over for a couple of days last week with the kids and it was really great.
I tried calling you a couple times.
How are you doing?
Yeah, i'm good.
Everything's fine.
I've been... i've been traveling a lot, so... well, are you busy tonight?
What do you mean?
I don't... maybe you wanna come by and say hello?
Around 7?
You don't have to if you don't want to.
I just, you know... look, i totally get if you don't wanna hang out with the dying girl, so... i can... i can come at 7.
Okay.
Okay.
Bye.
- Well, how you doing tonight?
- Hey.
- How you doing?
- Have fun.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Come in.
I am so glad she's gone.
Are you okay if we eat outside?
Eating?
You didn't eat already, did you?
- No.
- Okay.
No.
Well, it was a surprise but you're on time.
I haven't cooked anybody food for years, so you better like it.
Or lie to me.
This is for you.
You don't have to say anything.
I just got it... change in there.
Dinner is ready and you're not.
So hurry up.
Chop-chop.
You look great.
Yeah.
It's pink.
It's salmon.
You are so nice.
So are you.
Everything's vegetarian.
I hope you like eggplant parmesan.
I haven't treated myself very well in the past few years.
Start now.
All right.
What do you think?
It's delicious.
Glad you like it.
Do you wanna hear my favorite song?
Yes.
Are you gonna sing it?
No, i can't sing anymore.
Oh, and a performance.
Oh, no.
Shall we?
You need to relax.
This is relaxed.
I have a surprise for you.
Surprise?
Yes.
For me?
- Keep them closed.
- Okay.
And open.
Okay.
You cleaned the beast.
Actually, i fixed it.
No, you didn't.
Oh, okay, let's go, then.
Wait.
Are you serious?
Try it.
Okay.
Thank you.
Wait right here, okay?
I'll be right back.
Wait right here.
One second.
Hey!
Tell me what's going on.
- Now!
- All right.
Ben, you need to go home.
Do you know they keep a full history of every inquiry a revenue officer makes?
- You understand?
- Keep your voice down.
- Just keep your voice down.
- No.
What you are doing is a crime!
You are impersonating a federal officer.
It's a felony!
All right.
Listen.
You can't play with people's lives.
Do you understand that?
All right.
All right, there's a coffee shop.
There's a coffee shop near where i'm staying.
- Tomorrow we'll sit down...
- where are you staying, tim?
Tell me, because i don't know where my brother lives!
A motel.
Five blocks from here.
We'll sit down tomorrow morning, i guarantee it.
Where are my credentials?
Give me my credentials back.
Here it is.
Here.
Here.
Just go home.
You have a beautiful family.
Go home and enjoy them.
Tim, tim, tim, why are you even here?
Tell me, who is emily posa?
I'll explain everything tomorrow.
Look, give me your car keys.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm gonna be right here.
So you remember i love you and... tim, don't make me come knock on the door, okay?
I didn't realize how late it was and... i have a really long drive, so i need to go.
I don't wanna keep lying to you.
I don't wanna... wait, emily.
Do you wanna play a game?
What game?
The "what if" game.
The "what if" game.
What if my pager goes off and it's a heart and it works?
And my body doesn't reject it?
And what if i have time?
What if?
What if we have children?
What if we got married?
I love you.
- I love you too.
- I love you.
Hi.
Is dr.
Briar on duty tonight?
She's doing her rounds.
Can you tell her it's ben thomas?
It's very important.
- I'il... i'll page her.
- Thank you.
Dr. Briar to the nurses' station.
Hey.
- Is it emily?
- No, no.
I'm sorry.
It's... is there?
I'm sorry.
Do you have any more optimism about emily than you did the other day?
Ben when you're looking for a donor with a rare blood type the odds go way down.
To what?
They go down.
What's the...?
Give me a percentage.
Give me a number.
Three, 5 percent.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I wish the numbers were higher.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- I do.
Hello?
Dan.
It's time.
I love you.
1:38 a.m.
Hello?
Ezra.
My name is ben thomas.
I called you a few weeks ago.
You probably don't remember.
I do remember.
I wanna apologize for being so cruel to you but i had to be certain.
I had to be certain that you were a decent man.
Kind.
- Slow to anger.
- What do you want from me?
I wanna give you a gift.
You're gonna be contacted by a man named dan morris.
You can trust him.
Was that you at the diner?
Goodbye.
911 emergency.

I have you at 9212 west third street in los angeles.
Yes, room number 2.
What's the emergency?
There's been a suicide.
Who's the victim?
I am.
You are gonna need to stop looking at that thing so much.
Why?
Is it gonna crack?
Oh, no.
I paid extra for the non-cracking kind.
I bet you did.
- Why don't you just turn that off?
- I know.
No more.
No more work.
I'm done.
Almost done.
Almost done.
Tim!
I have procedures.
I understand, but she needs that heart or she will die.
- Ben?
- One, two, three.
Hey.
How you doing?
About a year after the accident, i got sick.
I got lung cancer, and i needed a double-iobe transplant.
Tim could only give me one, of course.
It must have planted a seed, because he... about six months later he donated the right part of his liver to this woman.
Her name is holly.
I'm proud of you kids.
Very proud.
Good job.
Good job.
- Ezra.
- Yeah.
Hi.
Are you a parent?
No.
Have we met?
You okay?
You must be emily.
Yes.
It's so nice to meet you.

- Thomas.
And don't you get me started on the pork

Well no, sir.I'm not much of a meateater myself.
But I hear really great things about the pork.

I don't have an order for a Ben Thomas.

I'm speaking to you.
I understand you refused to take your meds again this afternoon, is that true?
No, no.
Let's try using your words this time, okay Inez?
I mean this silent treatment isn't doing anybody any good.
Inez, how can we help you if you...
Okay, how about I come back tomorrow and see if you've changed your mind, okay?
.
That a girl.
I thought I was coming to your office today.
Yes, I was in the neighbourhood and thought i'd stop by, save you the drive.
Terrific.
Let's go talk in my office.
Come on.
I take a non nonesense approach
I cut the operating cost of this place over 17% last year, alone.
I am sure that made them happy.
Hell yeah!
Now if I can only get my own, personal finances in that kinda shape ...
I wouldn't have you sitting here, no offense
That you're new beemer out front?
(BMW)
Ben, I mean ...
When I found out that my bone marrow transplant wasn't succesfull ...
I'm well aware of your ongoing medical condition.
Things aren't looking very promising for me
Look.

I just really need this six months extension.
Really I mean,I'm doing the very best I can here, I promise you.
I'm gonna show myself out.
I'll be in touch.
Well, thank you I appreciate it.
I mean, this way everybody wins, right?
Hello.
My name is Ben.
I totally understand if you don't wanna speak to me either but I would really like to just have a moment of your time.
I'm trying to figure out What kind of man Stewart Goodman is.
It is whitin my power to drasticly change his circumstances.
But I don't wanna give that man a gift that he doesn't deserve.
I need you to tell me, wether or nothe is a good person.
"The drug he gives me, makes me dizzy."
"I want a new one."
That sounds very reasonable Inez.
What else?
You can trust me.
What else, Inez?
He's punishing you?
How is he punishing you?
How is he punishing you, Inez?
Ben?
Ben, where are you going?
- Where's the washroom?
- To the right.
Is there a problem?
- Give her a bath.
Right now!
- Absolutely
Thank you.
Thank you ...
Ben, I think you have the wrong impression here.
I'm gonna stop by from time to time to make sure you're showing these people some goddam respect.
- This is a misunderstanding, Okay?
- You don't treat people like that.
- Let me explain okay, Ben.
- And i'm not giving you an extension.
Ben!
I'm not giving you anything you anything!
I almost believed you, you son of a bitch.

You said you were gonna call me.

So, I had no information to give you.
Still you should call me.
- Right?
- Yes, I know.

I'm doing some soul-searching you know?
Don't do that.

Do you know they rent clubs up at the clubhouse.
I'm well aware of that.
I think I'm gonna keep my ass un-kicked today.
Were you looking at him, or where you looking at me?
Acctually I was just sitting here.
Am I doing it wrong?
- I think I saw you in the elevator the other day?
- Oh Yes ...
Acctually, you are being auditted.

Would you have a seat, please.
Miss Posar?
So, I've been looking over the income statement from last three years.
- 2005, 200 ...
- Were you ...
Were you in my room the other night?
No, ma'am.
I was not in your room the other night.
That's not exactly IRS protocol.
So I've been looking over 05, 06 and 07 and there seems to be quite a disparity between what you claimed and. ..
Mr Thomas.
I just got discharged.
So, you know unless you're gonna call me off to some IRS jail or something-
-I'd really like to get home now.
Sure.
No problem.
I'll be in touch.

Thankyou.
Hi,mynameisSusanNoah.
I'mcallingcuz'afriendofmine told me to do letter presentations and I was wondering ...
Hello.
Hi this is Emily.
Yeah I do wedding invatations.
I'm not able to take any requests though, right now.
I know someone nearby who does it .
she's not as good as I am, but ah.
Hello?
Duke!
?
Duke!
?
We're out here!
- Hello, Miss Posa.
- What are you doing here?
- I came to see you.
- Don't you people ever call ahead?
You people, descend to try to hide things.
Is that meat?
No!
No, no!
No meat!
No!
- He was really enjoying it.
- He eats steamed broccoli and Tofu.
- Why?
- He's a vegetarian.
- He is a vegetarian?
- Yes.
Well that sucks.
Can we talk?
Do you have a moment?
No.
Acctually I have to take Duke for a walk.
No problem.
I'll go with you, if you don't mind.
So I've been looking over 2005, 2006 and 2007 ... (Sigh) I'm listening.
- Can I get him for you?
- No.
I got him.
- Let me get him, are you alright?
- Yes.
Sorry.
Watch.
Heel!
Maybe we shouldn't feed him meat.
So I've been looking over ...
- Maybe we can do this later.
- Yeah.
So you cook it all ahead a time I see.
No.
Acctually I can't remember the last time I cooked.
This is my sisters way of looking out for me from afar.
- Do you have any siblings?
- Yes, one brother.
He's a good egg.
Yeah, I just have the one sister too.
Have you receiving income from any source that the government is currently un-aware of?
Lately, i've been taking to diving in local wishing wells so ...
I mean, it's just occasional dimes here and there ...
Or once in a while a quarter ...
No acctually I am, I had to re-finance this place to pay my past two medical bills
I've been informed that you suffer from congenital heart failure.
Yes.
Did you gather that, while stalking me at the hospital?
No ...
You're currently status 2.
Which means you are sick enough to be on a national UNO's waiting list- but not sick enough to be admitted into the hospital and placed on a status one.
So, basically, if your heart starts to fail quickly and no donor can be located, you're screwed.
Is it true that you said, that you do not believe that you even deserve a heart because your life is unremarkable in every way.
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I said that.
I'm Sorry.
Do you have to take any type of sensitivity training to join the IRS, Mr Thomas?
- No.
Not really.
- Yeah.
So you don't consider yourself a good person?
How would you answer that question If I asked you the same?
Unremarkable would be an upgrade for me, I assure you.
I'm Gonna freeze your accountas uncollectable until further notice.
I'm sure that'll buy you, five or six months penalty free.
Here's my card.
If anyone at the IRS tries to contact you you call me immediately.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay.
- Mr. Thomas!
- Yes?
Why do I get the feeling you're doing me a really big favor right now?
Because I get the feeling that you really deserve it.
Allright?
Uhm, you off to uh ...
You off to pollute somebody elses dog now?
No.
- Just going home.
- Where's that?
- Take care, Emily.
- You too.
- What is this thing for?
- Told you already.
- Why are you bringing a fish into your room?
- Because it's my room.
And I don't want anyone to go into my room, understood?
I don't think you can keep a fish in you room.
I think I can.
I have never had anybody who kept a fish in their room.
Now you do.
Good night.
Thefirsttime I ever saw a box jellyfish,
Iwastwelve.
Myfathertookus to the Monterey Bay aquarium.
Ineverforgotwhenhesaidthat it was the most deadly creature on earth.
Tomeit wasjust themostbeautiful thing I had ever seen.
I spoke to the doctor again He'd send over your files in the morning.
- Is this everything?
- Yes.
- Any questions?
- Same one.
Same answer then.
You know, I was thinking last night
About when we were fourteen and we made our Big Pact.
You remember on the beach, in front your grandparents house,
We agreed that we would never never date eachothers girls.
And I remembered that that night- you told me how much you liked Stacy Miller and that you were gonna ask her out.
And I said wow, hey man, you can't her and I already did it.
which we didn't but I wanted to ...
But she, liked you way more than she liked me
So I lied to you because I was so jelous.
And I've been carrying around this lie in my heart for the last 25 ...
Stop it !
Stop it!
Stay focused.
- Do what you promised me.
- What, you think I'm ...
Do what you promised me.
You think i'm gonna let you down now, aren't you?
I've known you my whole damn life!
Okay?
This,this!
This is nott something you do everyday, okay?
This is not easy for me!
I will make sure everything goes as planned.
Don't worry.
Thank you.
My God.

I don't know why I even called you, I'm sorry.
It's just that I have your card with me ...
Ben.
- You still there?
- Yes.
Do you ever think about dying, Ben?
Every now and again.
My face is, blueish.

You should try to rest.
Just see if you can get some sleep.
I like talking to you.
Ilike,talkingtoyoutoo.
Would you tell me a story, please?
Okay.
Once upon a time,
Therewasalittleboynamed ...
How lucky me, just got it on reserve like that, okay-
Let me guess.
His name was Ben.
- No, actually, this little boys name is Tim.
- I like the name Tim.
Go on.
Timslittlebrotherwas always pestering Tim
To make him paper airplanes, because he was really good at it.
But, Tim had much bigger dreams than that.
Okay.
Then what happened?
One day, Tim went out to the backyard And he put leaves and taped branches to his arms and started climbing their big oak tree.
His little brother said, "Tim, you can't fly!"
Andhesaid,"Ye you justwatch."
He got all the way to the top and jumped.
How tall was this tree?
Itwasprettytall.
He broke his arm.
Oh my god, this is a horrible story.
No, no!
It gets better.
From that experience, Tim realized that he wanted to fly.
So he dedicated his life to making space ships.
I thought you said this was a good story.
Oh well, that is until the dragons showed up .
Okay, I see.
Now it's getting better.
I like dragons.
Especially dragons in space.
Yes, and these were fire breething space dragons with really bad attitudes
I see ...
I have an idea.

Hi, Duke.
Hi, baby.
- What time does the nurse come?
- She should be there by the time I get home.
- Ben?
- Yes.
I know I am the girl with the broken wing ...
But who are you?
Who am I ...
I'm you friendly neighbourhood tax collector.
Ben.
Where the hell did you come from?
- I grew up in Oakland.
- Literally, okay.
Where did you go to college?
As far from Oakland as possible.
Massachussets Institute of Technology.
How about you?
UCLA.
You went to MIT?
Like, The MIT?
And now you're wondering how I wound up as a lowly tax collector?
Absolutely.
I sort of stumbled into this job.
That's a big stumble.
What from?
I always wanted to be an engineer.
An engineer.
What kind?
- The kind that sent people to the moon.
- Really?
Yes ...
I don't wanna talk about me, anymore.
That's too bad ...
Cuz' you're very interesting.
Have you ever been in love?
Emily, please ...
Yes, you have, Come on, you can tell me.
Yes.
But it ended.
- What happened?
- Stop it.
- Seriously, you could tell me ...
- Stop it.
You need to get some rest.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Or maybe I'll stop by.
No.
If I have questions tomorrow, what then?
That's not a part of the deal.
What the hell does that mean?
Emily, hold on.
- Just leave ...
- Emily, wait.
Wait!
Thank You for everything you did.
- Díd you like the eggs?
- They're okay, I guess.
- I don't like the eggs you got.
- Okay.
You're wearing suit pants.
- To weed.
- I didn't have any other clothes with me.
- You know, I was gonna get to this.
- I saw them the other day and I figured-
-I would just take the day off, and get this done for you.
- Ben.
- Yes?
This is a really ridiculous apology.
Come on.
I wanna show you something.
No, I gotta finish.
You can finish tomorrow.
Come on.
This is where I used to work.
And these are the artefacts of said work.
Those are great.
How old are they?
This one, is just shy of 120 years.
That's how I put up my line of wedding press cards, wedding invataions, invites.
How about this one?
That youngster ...
Hidelberg Windmill.
1956.
I call it "The Beast".
That seems appropriate.
Pooped out on me in about five years ago and I can't find anybody to fix it.
It's kind of a dying art.
Defibrilator here works though.
Luckily, kept my business afloat.
You wanna see how?
Please.
Now, true pressman hate, a modern girl, who want a decompression
So for a hundred years they tried their damndess, just to kiss it so it didn't leave an indictation
That's the only way to prove it's not digital.
I think it feels richer.
- Are you okay?
- Yes.
I don't really know anything about you or where you came from, But.
You keep showing up.
And I'm glad.
Okay.
Okay, So, Duke needs a walk.
Are you interested?
Yes.
He's lika a different dog with you around.
I don't think we ever properly bonded.
Why would you get, such a big dog?
Did you know that Great Danes, on average, only live about seven years?
They have heart issues.
I think I got him because-
-I thought he could help me with my illness.
There would be something I could take care of as supposed to being always taken care of.
And just so you know, I used to be really hot.
Like, unaditebly hot.
- Is that so?
- Yeah .
I've never felt like this in a really long time.
There are so many things that I want to do.
I wanna go on a plane for 13 hours and not have to stress that-
-I can't reach my doctor.
You know like just travel, go backpacking, have experiences.
To see the world.
I just wanna have the time to figure out who it is that I am you know?
what I like.
Do things, try things.
Get out of my head for once.
I would really like to go running.
I think about that sometimes.
How it would just feel like, to go running.
So-
See you tomorrow?
Yes.
But if you need anything, just call.
And I'll come right back.
Okay.
Bye.
- I had a really great time today.
- Me too.
Bye.
No anesthetic.
Have you ever donated bone marrow before?
You're a brave guy.
How long have you known Nicolas?
What the hell happened to you?
How much longer are you going to stay at my hotel?
- Motel.
- How much longer?
Acctually I was planning on dying here.
Well, then you need to pay in advance.
Hello?
Hey, it's Emily.
Are you sleeping?
Yes.
No.
- Is everything okay?

Do you know they keep a full history of every inquiry a revenue officer makes ?
- Do you understand that?
- Keep your voice down.
- Just keep your voice down.
- No, Tim, what you are doing is a crime.
You are impersonating a federal officer.
It's a felony!
You can't play with peoples lives, do you understand that?
Alright, There's a coffee shop there's a coffe shop, right near where I'm staying

I didn't realize how late it was.
And I have a really long drive.
So, I need to go.
I don't wanna keep lying to you.
I don't wanna ...
Do you want to play a game?
What game?
The "What if" game.
"The 'What if' game".
What if my pager goes off.
And It's a heart?
And, it works.
And my body doesn't reject it.
And-

What if ...
What if we have children?
What if we got married?

DrBriarto thenurseystation.
Hry.

Sorry.
Do you have any, more optimism about Emily, than you did the other day?
When you're looking for a donor with a rare blood type ...

They go down what, Give me a percentage.

I wish the numbers were higher ...
Thank you.
Hello?
Dan.
It's time.
I love you.
1:38AM
- Hello?
- Ezra.
My name is Ben Thomas.
I called you a few weeks ago, you probably don't remember.
I do, remember.
I want to apologize for being so cruel to you
But I had to be certain.
I had to be certain that you were a descent man, kind, slow to anger.
- What do you want from me?
- I want to give you a gift.
You're gonna be contacted by a man named Dan Morris.
- You can trust him.
- Was that you, at the diner?
Goodbye.
911emergency.

There's been a suicide.
Who'sthevictim?
I am.
- You are really gonna need to stop looking at that thing.
- Why?
Is it gonna crack?
No, no ...
I've paid extra for the non cracking kind.
I bet you did ...
- Honey, why don't you just tutn that off?
- I'm sorry.
No more work.
Almost done.
We have procedures ...
I understand, but she needs that heart or she's gonna to die!
Ben?
One, two, three ...
How are you doing?
About a year after the accident, I got sick, I got,
I got lung cancer.
I needed a double-lobe transplant.
Tim could only give me one, of course.
He must have planned to see you, cuz' he-
-about six months later he,
He donated the right part of his liver to this woman.
Her name is, Holly.
I'm proud of you.
Very proud.
Congratulations.
- Ezra.
- Yeah.
Hi.
Are you a parent?
No.
Have we met?
Are you okay?
You must be Emily.
Yes.
It's so nice to meet you.
Okay.
911 emergency.
I need an ambulance.
I have you at 9212 West Third Street in Los Angeles.
Yes, room number 2.
What's the emergency?
There's been a suicide.
Who's the victim?
I am.
In seven days, God created the world.
And in seven seconds I shattered mine.
- I can have four new fillets overnight.
- Oh, no.
No, thank you.
What is your name again?
Ezra?
Is that right?
Yes, sir.
I'll just need your first and last name so I can call up your account.
- You know what?
Here's what I'm thinking, Ezra.
I think I'm gonna mail you the meat back so you can see firsthand the type of dog food that you're peddling.
That won't be necessary, sir.
So how about we just start with your last name?
Thomas.
And don't even get me started on the pork.
- Have you tried the pork?
- Well, no, sir.
I'm not much of a meat eater myself, but I hear really great things about the pork.
- Oh, so you don't eat pork at all?
- No, sir.
Are you Jewish?
Is that why you don't eat pork, Ezra?
Well, can we...?
What's your first name, Mr. Thomas?
Ben.
Hold on, what was that voice?
I don't...
I don't have an order for a Ben Thomas.
Ezra, what was that voice?
- What voice?
- Are you blind?
- Excuse me?
- You're kidding me.
A blind beef salesman who doesn't eat meat.
Now, that...
That is rich.
That is rich.
Have you ever had sex, Ezra?
Did Lawrence in Accounting put you up to this?
Because somehow I can't imagine the blind, vegan beef salesman having sex.
- Listen, I'm trying to help you, sir.
- You're trying to help me?
The blind beef salesman is trying to help me?
I'm actually starting to feel pretty bad for you, Ezra.
Because I look at my life, and it is surrounded by so much beauty and you can't see shit.
Is that fair?
Does that seem fair to you, Ezra?
Do you even know what color the ocean is?
Do you?
- It's blue, sir.
- "It's blue, sir."
Say what you wanna say.
React.
Say what you wanna say to me.
Thank you for calling Cheyenne Meats.
That's not what you wanna say, you coward.
You coward.
You blind, vegan, beef-salesman, virgin coward!
- Goodbye, Mr. Thomas.
- Say what you wanna say.
Ken Anderson.
Nicole Anderson.
Allie Anderson.
Ed Rice.
Steven Phillips.
Monica Freeman.
Sarah Jensen.
Ken Anderson!
Nicole Anderson!
Allie Anderson!
Ed Rice!
Steven Phillips!
Monica Freeman!
And Sarah Jensen!
Hi, can I help you?
Yes.
Hello, I'm looking for Emily.
- You're a friend of hers?
- Yes, ma'am.
- She's not home.
- Oh, goodness.
No, she left this morning.
She had to do some more tests.
She asked me to watch Duke until she got back.
Okay.
You ever try mixing banana peel into the soil?
- Really?
- It works, I swear.
Oh, would you by chance know where I could find her?
Supervisor to 104.
Supervisor to 104.
Cardiac wing?
Take the elevator to the fifth floor then turn left.
Thank you.
Well, that's what I was just saying.
It's absolutely impossible.
Hold the elevator.
Thank you.
Can I help you?
Yes.
Good evening.
I'm here to see Emily Posa.
I'm sorry, visiting hours are from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.
You know, it is really important I speak to her for just a moment.
You'll just have to come back during visiting hours.
Thank you very much.
So if there is one thing that I have learned and you all should remember about winning these contracts:
Three steps.
First, tell them what you're gonna tell them.
Step two, you tell them.
Step three, tell them what you told them.
We are gonna close by reminding them that old girl has a 3-percent better impulse from sea level to vacuum and if they pass on that, quite frankly, they deserve another Sputnik.
Now, if you will excuse me I have a very lovely, very hungry woman at home waiting for me.
Sarah.
Honey.
Everyone at work kept saying it was daylight-savings time.
You were supposed to be here a while ago.
- I kept saying it wasn't.
- This happens all the time.
It's work.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- No, I'm angry with you.
I'm gonna be angry all night long.
- I'm angry with you.
- What are you doing?
How about that?
How about I'm angry with you?
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.
It's your brother.
Where are you?
I'm at the beach house.
Are you okay?
Of course.
Listen, why'd you disconnect the landline?
The phone broke.
I don't need it anymore.
Did I?
Did I do something?
No.
Not unless you're smoking again.
No, I've put on 20 pounds.
I'm in the best shape of my life.
Are you eating?
Are you taking care of yourself?
- You sound terrible again and...
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Look, I gotta go.
Give Melanie and the kids a hug and a kiss.
I'll talk to you later.
You take care of yourself.
Hold on.
I know it's been a while, but when you were staying here you didn't take something of mine by mistake, did you?
I remember giving you something.
You remember that?
Because I remember that very clearly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just remember I love you.
Hi, my name is Ben Thomas.
I'm here to see Stewart Goodman.
Inez, look at me, please.
Inez.
I'm speaking to you.
I understand you refused to take your meds again.
Is that true?
No, no, no.
Let's try using your words this time, okay, Inez?
I mean, this silent treatment isn't doing anybody any good.
Inez, how can we help you if...?
Okay, how about I come back tomorrow and see if you've changed your mind, okay?
Thattagirl.
I thought I was coming to your office today.
I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd stop by, save you the drive.
Terrific.
Well, look, let's go talk in my office, yeah?
Come on.
I take a no-nonsense approach.
I mean, I cut the operating costs of this place over 17 percent last year alone.
- I'm sure that made them happy.
- Oh, hell, yeah.
Now, if I could only get my own finances in that kind of shape, I wouldn't have you sitting here.
No offense.
That your new Beemer out front?
Ben, I mean, when I found out that my bone-marrow transplant wasn't successful...
I'm well aware of your ongoing medical condition.
Things aren't looking very promising for me.
Look I have a bonus coming in January.
I just really need this six-month extension.
Really, I mean, I am doing the very best I can here, I promise you.
I'm gonna show myself out.
I'll be in touch.
Well, thank you.
I appreciate it.
I mean, this way everybody wins, right?
Hello.
My name is Ben.
I totally understand if you don't wanna speak to me either.
But I would really like to just have a moment of your time.
I'm trying to figure out what kind of man Stewart Goodman is.
It is within my power to drastically change his circumstances.
But I don't wanna give that man a gift that he doesn't deserve.
I need you to tell me whether or not he is a good person.
"The drug he gives me makes me dizzy.
I want a new one."
Well, that sounds very reasonable, Inez.
What else?
You can trust me.
What else, Inez?
He's punishing you?
How is he punishing you?
How is he punishing you, Inez?
Ben?
- Hey, Ben, where you going?
- Where's the washroom?
To the right.
Is there a problem?
- Give her a bath, right now.
- Absolutely.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You have the wrong impression here.
I'm gonna stop by from time to time make sure you're showing these people some respect.
Look, this is a misunderstanding, okay?
You don't treat people like that.
Let me explain, okay, Ben?
- And I'm not giving you an extension.
- Ben!
I'm not giving you anything.
I almost believed you, you son of a bitch.
I almost believed.
Okay.
Grip and rip.
This time it's gonna be a lot different.
Hey.
- Hey, Michelle.
- Hey.
- Good to see you.
- You too.
- How are you?
- I'm good.
- Hey, man.
- Hey.
What are you doing here?
Just coming to make sure that she is still kicking your ass at everything.
And I am.
- Can we have a sec, hon?
- Yeah.
All right.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm good.
You said you were gonna call me on the 15th.
- Today is the 19th.
- I know.
Doctor didn't have the results, so I had no information to give you.
Still, you should call me.
- Yeah, I know.
Yes, I know.
- We're still friends.
Right?
Yeah.
I'm just...
I'm doing some soul-searching, you know?
Don't do that.
- We have a plan.
- I know.
- Do what you promised me.
- I will.
You know, they rent clubs up at the clubhouse.
I'm well aware of that.
I think I'm gonna keep my ass unkicked today.
Were you looking at him, or were you looking at me?
Actually, I was just sitting here.
Am I doing it wrong?
I think I saw you in the elevator the other day.
Oh, yes.
Actually, you are being audited.
My name is Ben Thomas.
I'm with the IRS, and you owe the government $56, 240.19.
I know.
And now you get me.
Would you have a seat, please, Miss Posa?
So I've been looking over the income statements from the last three years.
- 2005...
- Were...?
Were you in my room the other night?
No, ma'am, I was not in your room the other night.
That's not exactly IRS protocol.
So I've been looking over '05, '06 and '07.
There seems to be quite a disparity between what you claimed and...
Mr. Thomas?
I just got discharged.
So, you know, unless you're gonna, like haul me off to some IRS jail or something I'd really like to get home now.
- Oh, sure.
No problem.
- Okay.
I'll be in touch.
Welcome to the Travel Inn.
Can I help you?
I need a room.
How many hours?
About two weeks.
Clear it!
That's it, that's it!
All right, come on!
Vamos, Manny!
All right, all right.
That's it, that's it.
Hey!
- What you want?
- Break it up!
- You want some of this?
- Get off!
Get off!
Hey, Rico, knock it off!
Somebody wanna remind Rico where we are?
The sanctuary, coach!
- I can't hear you.
- The sanctuary, coach!
That's right, Rico, in the sanctuary.
Now give me 20 starts and stops.
Hello, this is Emily Posa.
I'm not home right now, but please leave a message and I'll call you back as soon as possible.
Thank you.
Hi, my name is Susan Nall.
I'm calling because a friend told me you do letterpress invitations, and I was wondering...
Hello?
Hi, this is Emily.
Yep, I do wedding invitations.
I'm not able to take any requests, though, right now.
I know someone nearby who does it.
She's not as good as I am, but her prices are very...
Hello?
Duke?
Duke.
We're out here.
Hello, Miss Posa.
What are you doing here?
Oh, I came to see you.
Don't you people ever call ahead?
You people tend to try to hide things.
Is that meat?
No!
No, no.
No.
No meat.
No.
- Well, he was really enjoying it.
- He eats steamed broccoli and tofu.
- Why?
- He's a vegetarian.
- He is a vegetarian?
- Yes.
Well, that sucks.
Hey, can we talk?
Do you have a moment?
No.
Actually, I have to take Duke for a walk.
No problem.
I'll go with you, if you don't mind.
- So...
- Hey, hey.
Hey.
So I've been looking over 2005, 2006 and 2007.
Now...
I'm listening.
- Can I get him for you?
- Nope.
I got him.
Let me get him.
Let me get him.
Let me get him.
- You all right?
- Yes.
Whoa, sorry.
Whoa, not these.
- That's okay.
Watch...
- No, no.
Heel, heel, heel.
Yeah, maybe we shouldn't feed him meat.
So I've been looking over...
- Yeah, maybe we can do this later.
- Yeah.
So you cook it all ahead of time, I see.
No, actually.
I can't remember the last time I cooked.
This is my sister's way of looking out for me from afar.
Do you have any siblings?
Yes, one brother.
He's a...
He's a good egg.
Yeah, I just have the one sister too.
Are you receiving income from any source that the government is currently unaware of?
Well, lately I've been taking to diving in local wishing wells, so...
I mean, but it's just occasional dimes here and there or, once in a while, a quarter.
No, actually I had to refinance this place to pay my past-due medical bills.
I've been informed that you suffer from congenital heart failure.
Yes.
Did you gather that while stalking me at the hospital?
No, I...
You're currently Status 2, which means you're sick enough to be on the national UNOS waiting list but not sick enough to be admitted into the hospital and placed on Status 1.
So basically, if your heart starts to fail quickly and no donor can be located you're screwed.
Is it true that you said that you do not believe that you even deserve a heart because your life is unremarkable in every way?
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I said that.
I'm sorry.
Do you have to take any type of sensitivity training to join the IRS, Mr. Thomas?
- No, not really.
- Yeah.
So you don't consider yourself a good person?
How would you answer that question if I asked you the same?
"Unremarkable" would be an upgrade for me I assure you.
I'm gonna freeze your accounts as uncollectible until further notice.
I'm sure that'll buy you five or six months, penalty-free.
Here's my card.
If anyone from the IRS tries to contact you you call me immediately.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay.
- Mr. Thomas?
- Yes.
Why do I get the feeling you're doing me a really big favor right now?
Because I get the feeling that you really deserve it.
All right?
You off to?
You off to pollute someone else's dog now?
No.
Just going home.
Where's that?
Take care, Emily.
You too.
- What is this thing for?
- I told you already.
And why are you bringing a fish into your room?
Because it's my room.
And I don't want anyone going into my room, understood?
Well, I don't think you can keep a fish in your room.
I think I can.
Well, I've never had anybody who kept a fish in their room.
Now you do.
Who?
Good night.
The first time I ever saw a box jellyfish I was 12.
Our father took us to the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
I never forgot when he said that it was the most deadly creature on earth.
To me it was just the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.
I spoke to the doctor again.
He's gonna send over your files in the morning.
- Is this everything?
- Yeah.
- Any questions?
- Same one.
Well, same answer, then.
You know, I was thinking last night about when we were 14 and we made our big pact.
You remember on the beach in front of your grandparents' house we agreed that we would never, never date each other's girls?
I remembered that that night you told me how much you liked Stacy Miller and that you were gonna ask her out.
And I said:
"Hey, man.
You can't.
Her and I already did it."
Which we didn't, but I wanted to but she liked you way more than she liked me, and...
So I lied to you because I was so jealous.
And I realized that I've been carrying around this lie in my heart for the last 25...
Stop it!
Stop it.
Stay focused.
Do what you promised me.
- What, you think I'm...?
- Do what you promised me.
You think I'm gonna let you down now, don't you?
I've known you my whole damn life!
Okay?
This?
This?
This is not something you do every day.
Okay?
This is...
This is not easy for me.
I'll make sure everything goes as planned.
Don't worry.
Thank you.
Oh, my God.
Hello, Holly.
Look at you.
- What are you doing here?
- I came to see you.
- Really?
- You have a minute?
Sure.
Come on in.
Here's my desk.
Have a seat.
You look great.
- I do?
- Yes.
I feel great.
- How are you?
- I'm really good.
I need a favor.
Whatever you need, just ask me.
I need a name.
Someone in the system.
Someone having a really hard time that needs help, but may be too proud to ask for a handout.
What are you doing?
I'm helping.
I need a name.
Okay.
Connie Tepos.
Her boyfriend almost killed her last year when she tried to leave.
He broke three of her ribs last month.
She's scared to death to press charges and we can't do anything.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Connie Tepos?
- Yes?
My name is Ben Thomas.
I'm with the IRS.
IRS?
But I always pay my taxes.
Yes, this is more of a general inquiry.
I don't understand.
What...?
May I come in?
Not now.
My boyfriend is not here.
It's very important for your family.
For my family?
Beautiful.
Please, have a seat.
What's this all about?
Your case has come to my attention.
And I wanted to get to know you.
You wanted to get to know me?
Why?
Because I'd like to help you.
I don't understand.
I'm aware of your case.
And your boyfriend.
What are you talking about?
You know what I'm talking about.
No, I have no idea what you're talking about.
Kids, go to your room.
He's coming back?
He's not coming back.
You said you were from the IRS, but you're lying to me.
- No.
- You're not telling me the truth.
Who sent you here?
Please sit down.
I'm not going to sit down.
- Please, calm down.
- I'm not going to calm down.
You come into my house.
You talking to me about mi caso y mi boyfriend?
- Who sent you here?
- Nobody.
Nobody?
Get out of my house immediately.
You can trust me.
I trust no one, Mr. Thomas.
I talked to Holly.
I can get you out of here.
To a safe place.
A beautiful place.
Why did you talk to Holly?
Your children are in danger here.
Don't talk about my kids, Mr. Thomas.
- You don't know.
- You don't have to live like this.
Get out of my house now or I'm gonna call the police.
- Okay, okay.
- Who are you?
- I want you to take my card.
- I don't need help.
I want you to take my card, and call me...
- I don't need it.
- I'm gonna leave it.
Okay.
Thank you.
Get out right now.
- You're not helpless.
- Can you leave?
This is my house.
Please, just think about it.
I don't need you.
- I can't talk right now.
- I need to talk immediately.
- Where are you?
- I'm nowhere.
I'm gonna meet you at the house.
Look, no.
I'm not at the house.
I'm traveling.
I'll talk to you next week.
No, no, no.
We need to discuss this right now.
Wouldn't wanna get on her bad side.
- I'll sign to that.
- Yeah.
How you doing, you two?
I'm good.
Got a big day.
Yep.
No more dialysis, George.
See you in the O.R.
Yep.
- I'll see you there as well.
- Yes, sir.
Thank you.
So I heard you raised enough money to give a couple of the kids partial scholarships to college.
It's no big deal.
I just convinced a couple of bigwig donors that what the world really needs to see is more Latinos on ice.
You know, Ben, I keep asking you this but why me?
Because you are a good man.
No, really.
Even when you don't know that people are watching you.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Okay, I can't hear you, so try back again.
Gonna hang up now.
Bye.
Mr. Thomas?
We're ready for you.
These are beautiful.
Banana peels.
Who knew?
Emily?
Can I get a refill?
- Susan?
- Yeah.
How's Ryan?
He's good.
He's at his dad's this weekend.
Will you tell him for me that I'm ready whenever he is for a free lesson?
Yeah, all right.
Things are kind of crazy right now with school but maybe when school's out.
Oh, yeah.
That's perfect.
How's the pie?
Oh, it's...
It's good.
You gonna ask her out?
The waitress.
No.
You never know.
I don't...
I don't think she sees me.
Good night, Ezra.
Hello?
Ben?
Hi, I'm sorry to call so late.
Did...?
Did someone from the IRS contact you?
No.
I just...
I was having trouble breathing after I took Duke for a walk, and I fainted.
An ambulance had to take me to the hospital.
I'm so sorry.
I don't know why I even called you.
I'm sorry.
It's just that I have your card with me, and...
Ben?
Are you still there?
Yes.
Do you ever think about dying, Ben?
Every now and again.
My face is bluish.
It's not exactly a good sign.
You should try to rest.
Just...
Why don't you see if you can get some sleep?
I like talking to you.
I like talking to you too.
Would you tell me a story, please?
Okay.
All right.
Once upon a time there was a little boy named...
Oh, lucky me, you just got it on reserve like that.
Okay.
Let me guess.
His name was Ben.
No, actually, this little boy's name is Tim.
I like the name Tim.
Go on.
Tim's little brother was always pestering Tim to make him paper airplanes, because he was really good at it.
But Tim had much bigger dreams than that.
Okay.
Then what happened?
One day, Tim went out to the backyard and he put leaves and taped branches to his arms and started climbing the big oak tree.
His little brother said, "Tim, you can't fly."
And he said, "Yeah?
You just watch."
He got all the way to the top and jumped.
How tall was this tree?
It was...
It was pretty tall.
He broke his arm.
Oh, my God...
This is a horrible story.
Oh, no, no.
It gets better.
From that experience, Tim realized that he wanted to fly.
So he dedicated his life to making spaceships.
I thought you said this was a good story.
Oh, well...
Yeah, that is until the dragons showed up.
Oh, okay, see, now it's getting better.
I like dragons.
Especially dragons in space.
Yes, and these were fire-breathing space dragons with really bad attitudes.
I see.
I have an idea.
Why don't you try to fall asleep and when you do, I'll just hang up.
Okay.
Ben?
Yes.
Thank you for listening.
And for talking.
Try to fall asleep.
Good night, Ben.
Good night, Emily.
Emily?
Emily?
I lied to you.
I think about dying every day.
Dr. King to NICU.
Dr. Wesley King, please report to NICU.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
When did you get here?
Last night, after we talked.
You slept here?
Good morning.
How's our patient?
- Morning.
Better.
- Good.
- Hello.
- Hi, Ben.
Is that right?
IRS?
- Yes, how are you?
- Good, thank you.
- I'll leave you two alone.
- No, no, stay, please.
Don't go.
He can...
He can stay.
Whatever you want.
You fainted because your heart was too weak to pump enough blood to your brain.
It's enlarged and it's starting to shut down.
How long?
It's entirely up to your heart.
Could be six weeks, could be a month.
But we've upped you to Status 1 B.
At least I'm on the list.
Not only that, but we're giving you this pager.
And when it goes off, it means you have a donor.
The inotrope drug I started you on it's gonna stabilize your blood pressure within 24 hours.
Then what?
We wait.
- Can I do that at home?
- Once you're stable, you can.
Okay.
I'm gonna run to the cafeteria.
I'm gonna get you something.
If you want something else, I can get you something else.
Would you stay?
I mean, unless you have something else to do.
- I'd really like it if you stayed.
- I don't have anything.
Okay.
Okay.
Hey, hey, hey.
What the hell is that thing?
It's a dog.
Just for one night.
No.
Hold on, hold on.
I don't give two shits, okay?
We have a dog policy here.
Little dogs only.
Poodles and Shih Tzus.
It's in the contract.
It's English and Spanish for everyone to see.
And besides, that, my friend, is not a dog.
It's a goddamn horse.
Well, let me know when you add a horse policy to the contract.
Yes.
Mr. Thomas, it's Connie Tepos.
Hey, Connie.
I don't know why I'm calling you but I'm calling you.
You said you could help us and...
Can you really help us?
This just doesn't make any sense.
- What if he finds us?
- He won't.
- What makes you so sure?
- Stop it.
- You don't know him.
- Stop it.
Don't be weak.
- Don't be weak.
- I'm not weak.
I'm strong.
Take this.
Take it.
You are gonna start this car and you're gonna go.
This is real, and this is gonna be your new life.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
Look at those babies.
Look at those babies.
Look how beautiful those babies are.
I know, I know.
They deserve it.
Okay?
You're headed north up the coast.
Lorena.
Lorena.
I've always believed this place can heal the soul.
Mommy, the ocean.
Yes, the ocean.
I hope that proves true for you.
When you sign your name on the dotted line of the contract you'll own my house outright.
I only ask that you never mention how you got the house or try to contact me for any reason.
And if you're wondering why you, please stop.
All I ask is for you to honor my wishes and, of course, live life abundantly.
Hey.
Thanks.
Got it.
Hi, Duke.
Hi, baby.
What time does the nurse come?
She should be there by the time I get home.
- Ben?
- Yes.
I know I'm the girl with the broken wing.
But who are you?
Who am I?
I am your friendly neighborhood tax collector.
Ben.
Where the hell did you come from?
I grew up in Oakland.
Literally.
Okay.
Where did you go to college?
As far from Oakland as possible.
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
How about you?
UCLA.
You went to MIT?
Like, the MIT?
Oh, and now you're wondering how I wound up as a lowly tax collector.
Absolutely.
- I sort of stumbled into this job.
- That's a big stumble.
What from?
I always wanted to be an engineer.
An engineer?
What kind?
The kind that sent people to the moon.
Really?
Yes.
I don't wanna talk about me anymore.
That's too bad, because you're very interesting.
Have you...?
Have you ever been in love?
Emily, please.
Yes, you have.
Come on, you can tell me.
Yes.
But it ended.
- What happened?
- Stop it.
- No, seriously, you can tell...
- Stop it.
You need to get some rest.
I'll call you tomorrow, or maybe I'll stop by.
No, if I have questions tomorrow, what then?
That's not a part of the deal.
What the hell does that mean?
Emily, hold on.
Hold on.
- Just leave.
- Emily, wait.
Wait!
Thank you for everything you did.
Did you like the eggs?
They were okay, I guess.
I don't like the eggs you buy.
Okay.
You're wearing suit pants.
To weed.
Yeah, I didn't...
I didn't have any other clothes with me.
- You know, I was gonna get to those.
- I saw them the other day.
I figured I would just take the day off and get this done for you.
Ben?
Yeah?
This is a really ridiculous apology.
Come on.
I wanna show you something.
Oh, no, I gotta finish.
You can finish tomorrow.
Come on.
This is where I used to work.
And these are the artifacts of said work.
Wow, those are great.
How old are they?
This one is just shy of 120 years.
It's how I put out my line of letterpress cards, wedding invitations, invites.
What about this one?
That youngster is the Heidelberg Windmill, 1956.
Call it "The Beast."
Well, that seems appropriate.
It pooped out on me about five years ago, though.
And I can't find anybody to fix it.
It's kind of a dying art.
Defibrillator here works, though.
Luckily.
It kept my business afloat.
Wanna see how?
Please.
Okay.
Now, true pressmen hate that we modern girls want a deep impression.
See, for a hundred years, they tried their damnedest just to kiss it so that it didn't leave an indentation.
Now it's the only way to prove it's not digital.
I think it feels richer.
You okay?
Yeah.
Look, Ben...
I don't really know anything about you or where you came from but you keep showing up.
And I'm glad.
Okay.
Okay.
So Duke needs a walk.
Are you interested?
Yes.
Come on.
Hey, hey.
Right here.
There you go.
He's like a different dog with you around.
I don't think we ever properly bonded.
Why would you get such a big dog?
Did you know that Great Danes on average only live about seven years?
They have heart issues.
I think I got him because I thought he could help me with my illness.
It'd be something I could take care of as opposed to being always taken care of.
You know, just so you know, I used to be really hot.
Like, unauditably hot.
Is that so?
Yeah.
I haven't felt like this in a really long time.
There's so many things that I wanna do.
I wanna go on a plane for 13 hours and not have to stress that I can't reach my doctor.
You know, like, just travel.
Go backpacking, have experiences.
See the world.
I just wanna have the time to figure out who it is that I am.
You know, what I like.
Do things, try things, get out of my head for once.
I would really like to go running.
I think about that sometimes.
What it would just feel like to go running.
So see you tomorrow?
Yes.
But if you need anything, just call and I'll come right back.
Okay.
Bye.
I had a really great time today.
Me too.
Bye.
No anesthetic.
You ever donated bone marrow before?
You're a brave guy.
How long have you known Nicholas?
What the hell happened to you?
Hey, how much longer are you gonna stay in my hotel?
Motel.
How much longer?
Actually, I was planning on dying here.
Well, then you need to pay in advance.
Hello?
Hey, it's Emily.
Are you sleeping?
Yes.
No.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
My sister came over for a couple of days last week with the kids and it was really great.
I tried calling you a couple times.
How are you doing?
Yeah, I'm good.
Everything's fine.
I've been...
I've been traveling a lot, so...
Well, are you busy tonight?
What do you mean?
I don't...
Maybe you wanna come by and say hello?
Around 7?
You don't have to if you don't want to.
I just, you know...
Look, I totally get if you don't wanna hang out with the dying girl, so...
I can...
I can come at 7.
Okay.
Okay.
Bye.
- Well, how you doing tonight?
- Hey.
- How you doing?
- Have fun.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Come in.
I am so glad she's gone.
Are you okay if we eat outside?
Eating?
You didn't eat already, did you?
- No.
- Okay.
No.
Well, it was a surprise but you're on time.
I haven't cooked anybody food for years, so you better like it.
Or lie to me.
This is for you.
You don't have to say anything.
I just got it...
Change in there.
Dinner is ready and you're not.
So hurry up.
Chop-chop.
You look great.
Yeah.
It's pink.
It's salmon.
You are so nice.
So are you.
Everything's vegetarian.
I hope you like eggplant Parmesan.
I haven't treated myself very well in the past few years.
Start now.
All right.
What do you think?
It's delicious.
Glad you like it.
Do you wanna hear my favorite song?
Yes.
Are you gonna sing it?
No, I can't sing anymore.
Oh, and a performance.
Oh, no.
Shall we?
You need to relax.
This is relaxed.
I have a surprise for you.
Surprise?
Yes.
For me?
- Keep them closed.
- Okay.
And open.
Okay.
You cleaned The Beast.
Actually, I fixed it.
No, you didn't.
Oh, okay, let's go, then.
Wait.
Are you serious?
Try it.
Okay.
Thank you.
Wait right here, okay?
I'll be right back.
Wait right here.
One second.
Hey!
Tell me what's going on.
- Now!
- All right.
Ben, you need to go home.
Do you know they keep a full history of every inquiry a revenue officer makes?
- You understand?
- Keep your voice down.
- Just keep your voice down.
- No.
What you are doing is a crime!
You are impersonating a federal officer.
It's a felony!
All right.
Listen.
You can't play with people's lives.
Do you understand that?
All right.
All right, there's a coffee shop.
There's a coffee shop near where I'm staying.
- Tomorrow we'll sit down...
- Where are you staying, Tim?
Tell me, because I don't know where my brother lives!
A motel.
Five blocks from here.
We'll sit down tomorrow morning, I guarantee it.
Where are my credentials?
Give me my credentials back.
Here it is.
Here.
Here.
Just go home.
You have a beautiful family.
Go home and enjoy them.
Tim, Tim, Tim, why are you even here?
Tell me, who is Emily Posa?
I'll explain everything tomorrow.
Look, give me your car keys.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm gonna be right here.
So you remember I love you and...
Tim, don't make me come knock on the door, okay?
I didn't realize how late it was and...
I have a really long drive, so I need to go.
I don't wanna keep lying to you.
I don't wanna...
Wait, Emily.
Do you wanna play a game?
What game?
The "what if" game.
The "what if" game.
What if my pager goes off and it's a heart and it works?
And my body doesn't reject it?
And what if I have time?
What if?
What if we have children?
What if we got married?
I love you.
- I love you too.
- I love you.
Hi.
Is Dr. Briar on duty tonight?
She's doing her rounds.
Can you tell her it's Ben Thomas?
It's very important.
- I'll...
I'll page her.
- Thank you.
Dr. Briar to the nurses' station.
Hey.
- Is it Emily?
- No, no.
I'm sorry.
It's...
Is there?
I'm sorry.
Do you have any more optimism about Emily than you did the other day?
Ben when you're looking for a donor with a rare blood type the odds go way down.
To what?
They go down.
What's the...?
Give me a percentage.
Give me a number.
Three, 5 percent.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I wish the numbers were higher.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- I do.
Hello?
Dan.
It's time.
I love you.
1:38 a.m.
Hello?
Ezra.
My name is Ben Thomas.
I called you a few weeks ago.
You probably don't remember.
I do remember.
I wanna apologize for being so cruel to you but I had to be certain.
I had to be certain that you were a decent man.
Kind.
- Slow to anger.
- What do you want from me?
I wanna give you a gift.
You're gonna be contacted by a man named Dan Morris.
You can trust him.
Was that you at the diner?
Goodbye.
911 emergency.
I need an ambulance.
I have you at 9212 West Third Street in Los Angeles.
Yes, room number 2.
What's the emergency?
There's been a suicide.
Who's the victim?
I am.
You are gonna need to stop looking at that thing so much.
Why?
Is it gonna crack?
Oh, no.
I paid extra for the non-cracking kind.
I bet you did.
- Why don't you just turn that off?
- I know.
No more.
No more work.
I'm done.
Almost done.
Almost done.
Tim!
I have procedures.
I understand, but she needs that heart or she will die.
- Ben?
- One, two, three.
Hey.
How you doing?
About a year after the accident, I got sick.
I got lung cancer, and I needed a double-lobe transplant.
Tim could only give me one, of course.
It must have planted a seed, because he...
About six months later he donated the right part of his liver to this woman.
Her name is Holly.
I'm proud of you kids.
Very proud.
Good job.
Good job.
- Ezra.
- Yeah.
Hi.
Are you a parent?
No.
Have we met?
You okay?
You must be Emily.
Yes.
It's so nice to meet you.

That a girl.
I thought I was coming to your office today.
Yes, I was in the neighbourhood and thought i'd stop by, save you the drive.
Terrific.
Let's go talk in my office.
Come on.
I take a non nonesense approach
I cut the operating cost of this place over 17% last year, alone.
149 00:15:14,178 -- 00:15:16,178 I am sure that made them happy.
Hell yeah!

I wouldn't have you sitting here, no offense
That you're new beemer out front?
(BMW) 154 00:15:32,370 -- 00:15:34,370 Ben, I mean ...

Hello.
My name is Ben.
I totally understand if you don't wanna speak to me either but I would really like to just have a moment of your time.
I'm trying to figure out What kind of man Stewart Goodman is.
It is whitin my power to drasticly change his circumstances.
But I don't wanna give that man a gift that he doesn't deserve.
I need you to tell me, wether or nothe is a good person.
"The drug he gives me, makes me dizzy."
"I want a new one."
That sounds very reasonable Inez.
What else?
You can trust me.
What else, Inez?
He's punishing you?
How is he punishing you?
How is he punishing you, Inez?
Ben?
Ben, where are you going?
- Where's the washroom?
- To the right.
Is there a problem?
- Give her a bath.
Right now!
- Absolutely
Thank you.
Thank you ...
Ben, I think you have the wrong impression here.
I'm gonna stop by from time to time to make sure you're showing these people some goddam respect.
- This is a misunderstanding, Okay?
- You don't treat people like that.
- Let me explain okay, Ben.
- And i'm not giving you an extension.
Ben!
I'm not giving you anything you anything!
I almost believed you, you son of a bitch.
I almost believed!
Hey!

Miss Posar?
So, I've been looking over the income statement from last three years.
- 2005, 200 ...
- Were you ...
Were you in my room the other night?
No, ma'am.
I was not in your room the other night.
That's not exactly IRS protocol.
So I've been looking over 05, 06 and 07 and there seems to be quite a disparity between what you claimed and. ..
Mr Thomas.
I just got discharged.
So, you know unless you're gonna call me off to some IRS jail or something-
-I'd really like to get home now.
Sure.
No problem.
I'll be in touch.
Welcome to the Travel Inn.
Can I help you?
- I need a room.
- How many hours?
About two weeks.
Alright alright, thats it!
Rico!
Rico, knock it off!
Somebody wanna remind Rico where we are?
In the sanctuary, Coach!
- I can't hear you.
- The sanctuary, coach!
That's right Rico, in the sanctuary.
Now give me 20 stops and starts.

Thankyou.
Hi,mynameisSusanNoah.
I'mcallingcuz'afriendofmine told me to do letter presentations and I was wondering ...
Hello.
Hi this is Emily.
Yeah I do wedding invatations.
I'm not able to take any requests though, right now.
I know someone nearby who does it .
she's not as good as I am, but ah.
Hello?
Duke!
?
Duke!
?
We're out here!
- Hello, Miss Posa.
- What are you doing here?
- I came to see you.
- Don't you people ever call ahead?
You people, descend to try to hide things.
Is that meat?
No!
No, no!
No meat!
No!
- He was really enjoying it.
- He eats steamed broccoli and Tofu.
- Why?
- He's a vegetarian.
- He is a vegetarian?
- Yes.
Well that sucks.
Can we talk?
Do you have a moment?
No.
Acctually I have to take Duke for a walk.
No problem.
I'll go with you, if you don't mind.
So I've been looking over 2005, 2006 and 2007 ... (Sigh) I'm listening.
- Can I get him for you?
- No.
I got him.
- Let me get him, are you alright?
- Yes.
Sorry.
Watch.
Heel!
Maybe we shouldn't feed him meat.
So I've been looking over ...
- Maybe we can do this later.
- Yeah.
So you cook it all ahead a time I see.
No.
Acctually I can't remember the last time I cooked.
This is my sisters way of looking out for me from afar.
- Do you have any siblings?
- Yes, one brother.
He's a good egg.
Yeah, I just have the one sister too.
Have you receiving income from any source that the government is currently un-aware of?
Lately, i've been taking to diving in local wishing wells so ...
I mean, it's just occasional dimes here and there ...
Or once in a while a quarter ...
No acctually I am, I had to re-finance this place to pay my past two medical bills
I've been informed that you suffer from congenital heart failure.
Yes.
Did you gather that, while stalking me at the hospital?
No ...
You're currently status 2.
Which means you are sick enough to be on a national UNO's waiting list- but not sick enough to be admitted into the hospital and placed on a status one.
So, basically, if your heart starts to fail quickly and no donor can be located, you're screwed.
Is it true that you said, that you do not believe that you even deserve a heart because your life is unremarkable in every way.
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I said that.
I'm Sorry.
Do you have to take any type of sensitivity training to join the IRS, Mr Thomas?
- No.
Not really.
- Yeah.
So you don't consider yourself a good person?
How would you answer that question If I asked you the same?
Unremarkable would be an upgrade for me, I assure you.
I'm Gonna freeze your accountas uncollectable until further notice.
I'm sure that'll buy you, five or six months penalty free.
Here's my card.
If anyone at the IRS tries to contact you you call me immediately.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay.
- Mr. Thomas!
- Yes?
Why do I get the feeling you're doing me a really big favor right now?
Because I get the feeling that you really deserve it.
Allright?
Uhm, you off to uh ...
You off to pollute somebody elses dog now?
No.
- Just going home.
- Where's that?
- Take care, Emily.
- You too.
- What is this thing for?
- Told you already.
- Why are you bringing a fish into your room?
- Because it's my room.
And I don't want anyone to go into my room, understood?
I don't think you can keep a fish in you room.
I think I can.
I have never had anybody who kept a fish in their room.
Now you do.
Good night.
Thefirsttime I ever saw a box jellyfish,
Iwastwelve.
Myfathertookus to the Monterey Bay aquarium.
Ineverforgotwhenhesaidthat it was the most deadly creature on earth.
Tomeit wasjust themostbeautiful thing I had ever seen.
I spoke to the doctor again He'd send over your files in the morning.
- Is this everything?
- Yes.
- Any questions?
- Same one.
Same answer then.
You know, I was thinking last night
About when we were fourteen and we made our Big Pact.
You remember on the beach, in front your grandparents house,
We agreed that we would never never date eachothers girls.
And I remembered that that night- you told me how much you liked Stacy Miller and that you were gonna ask her out.
And I said wow, hey man, you can't her and I already did it.
which we didn't but I wanted to ...
But she, liked you way more than she liked me
So I lied to you because I was so jelous.
And I've been carrying around this lie in my heart for the last 25 ...
Stop it !
Stop it!
Stay focused.
- Do what you promised me.
- What, you think I'm ...
Do what you promised me.
You think i'm gonna let you down now, aren't you?
I've known you my whole damn life!
Okay?
This,this!
This is nott something you do everyday, okay?
This is not easy for me!
I will make sure everything goes as planned.
Don't worry.
Thank you.
My God.

I'm so sorry.
I don't know why I even called you, I'm sorry.
It's just that I have your card with me ...
Ben.
- You still there?
- Yes.
Do you ever think about dying, Ben?
Every now and again.
My face is, blueish.
It's not exactly a good sign.
You should try to rest.
Just see if you can get some sleep.
I like talking to you.
Ilike,talkingtoyoutoo.
Would you tell me a story, please?
Okay.
Once upon a time,
Therewasalittleboynamed ...
How lucky me, just got it on reserve like that, okay-
Let me guess.
His name was Ben.
- No, actually, this little boys name is Tim.
- I like the name Tim.
Go on.
Timslittlebrotherwas always pestering Tim
To make him paper airplanes, because he was really good at it.
But, Tim had much bigger dreams than that.
Okay.
Then what happened?
One day, Tim went out to the backyard And he put leaves and taped branches to his arms and started climbing their big oak tree.
His little brother said, "Tim, you can't fly!"
Andhesaid,"Ye you justwatch."
He got all the way to the top and jumped.
How tall was this tree?
Itwasprettytall.
He broke his arm.
Oh my god, this is a horrible story.
No, no!
It gets better.
From that experience, Tim realized that he wanted to fly.
So he dedicated his life to making space ships.
I thought you said this was a good story.
Oh well, that is until the dragons showed up .
Okay, I see.
Now it's getting better.
I like dragons.
Especially dragons in space.
Yes, and these were fire breething space dragons with really bad attitudes
I see ...
I have an idea.
Whydon'tyoutry tofall asleep, and when you do.
I'll just hang up.
- Okay.
Ben ...
- Yes.
Thank you for listening ...

Hi, Duke.
Hi, baby.
- What time does the nurse come?
- She should be there by the time I get home.
- Ben?
- Yes.
I know I am the girl with the broken wing ...
But who are you?
Who am I ...
I'm you friendly neighbourhood tax collector.
Ben.
Where the hell did you come from?
- I grew up in Oakland.
- Literally, okay.
Where did you go to college?
As far from Oakland as possible.
Massachussets Institute of Technology.
How about you?
UCLA.
You went to MIT?
Like, The MIT?
And now you're wondering how I wound up as a lowly tax collector?
Absolutely.
I sort of stumbled into this job.
That's a big stumble.
What from?
I always wanted to be an engineer.
An engineer.
What kind?
- The kind that sent people to the moon.
- Really?
Yes ...
I don't wanna talk about me, anymore.
That's too bad ...
Cuz' you're very interesting.
Have you ever been in love?
Emily, please ...
Yes, you have, Come on, you can tell me.
Yes.
But it ended.
- What happened?
- Stop it.
- Seriously, you could tell me ...
- Stop it.
You need to get some rest.
I'll call you tomorrow.
Or maybe I'll stop by.
No.
If I have questions tomorrow, what then?
That's not a part of the deal.
What the hell does that mean?
Emily, hold on.
- Just leave ...
- Emily, wait.
Wait!
Thank You for everything you did.
- Díd you like the eggs?
- They're okay, I guess.
- I don't like the eggs you got.
- Okay.
You're wearing suit pants.
- To weed.
- I didn't have any other clothes with me.
- You know, I was gonna get to this.
- I saw them the other day and I figured-
-I would just take the day off, and get this done for you.
- Ben.
- Yes?
This is a really ridiculous apology.
Come on.
I wanna show you something.
No, I gotta finish.
You can finish tomorrow.
Come on.
This is where I used to work.
And these are the artefacts of said work.
Those are great.
How old are they?
This one, is just shy of 120 years.
That's how I put up my line of wedding press cards, wedding invataions, invites.
How about this one?
That youngster ...
Hidelberg Windmill.
1956.
I call it "The Beast".
That seems appropriate.
Pooped out on me in about five years ago and I can't find anybody to fix it.
It's kind of a dying art.
Defibrilator here works though.
Luckily, kept my business afloat.
You wanna see how?
Please.
Now, true pressman hate, a modern girl, who want a decompression
So for a hundred years they tried their damndess, just to kiss it so it didn't leave an indictation
That's the only way to prove it's not digital.
I think it feels richer.
- Are you okay?
- Yes.
I don't really know anything about you or where you came from, But.
You keep showing up.
And I'm glad.
Okay.
Okay, So, Duke needs a walk.
Are you interested?
Yes.
He's lika a different dog with you around.
I don't think we ever properly bonded.
Why would you get, such a big dog?
Did you know that Great Danes, on average, only live about seven years?
They have heart issues.
I think I got him because-
-I thought he could help me with my illness.
There would be something I could take care of as supposed to being always taken care of.
And just so you know, I used to be really hot.
Like, unaditebly hot.
- Is that so?
- Yeah .
I've never felt like this in a really long time.
There are so many things that I want to do.
I wanna go on a plane for 13 hours and not have to stress that-
-I can't reach my doctor.
You know like just travel, go backpacking, have experiences.
To see the world.
I just wanna have the time to 707.5 01:14:49,900 -- 01:14:51,700 figure out who it is that I am you know?
what I like.
Do things, try things.
Get out of my head for once.
I would really like to go running.
I think about that sometimes.
How it would just feel like, to go running.
So- 712.5 01:15:52,906 -- 01:15:55,379 See you tomorrow?
Yes.
But if you need anything, just call.
And I'll come right back.

What is your name again?
Ezra?
Is that right?
Yes, sir.
I'll just need your first and last name so I can call up your account.
- You know what?
Here's what I'm thinking, Ezra.
I think I'm gonna mail you the meat back so you can see firsthand the type of dog food that you're peddling.
That won't be necessary, sir.
So how about we just start with your last name?
Thomas.
And don't even get me started on the pork.
- Have you tried the pork?
- Well, no, sir.
I'm not much of a meat eater myself, but I hear really great things about the pork.
- Oh, so you don't eat pork at all?
- No, sir.
Are you Jewish?
Is that why you don't eat pork, Ezra?
Well, can we...?
What's your first name, Mr. Thomas?
Ben.
Hold on, what was that voice?
I don't...
I don't have an order for a Ben Thomas.
Ezra, what was that voice?
- What voice?
- Are you blind?
- Excuse me?
- You're kidding me.
A blind beef salesman who doesn't eat meat.
Now, that...
That is rich.
That is rich.
Have you ever had sex, Ezra?
Did Lawrence in Accounting put you up to this?
Because somehow I can't imagine the blind, vegan beef salesman having sex.
- Listen, I'm trying to help you, sir.
- You're trying to help me?
The blind beef salesman is trying to help me?
I'm actually starting to feel pretty bad for you, Ezra.
Because I look at my life, and it is surrounded by so much beauty and you can't see shit.
Is that fair?
Does that seem fair to you, Ezra?
Do you even know what color the ocean is?
Do you?
- It's blue, sir.
- "It's blue, sir."
Say what you wanna say.
React.
Say what you wanna say to me.
Thank you for calling Cheyenne Meats.
That's not what you wanna say, you coward.
You coward.
You blind, vegan, beef-salesman, virgin coward!
- Goodbye, Mr. Thomas.
- Say what you wanna say.
Ken Anderson.
Nicole Anderson.
Allie Anderson.
Ed Rice.
Steven Phillips.
Monica Freeman.
Sarah Jensen.
Ken Anderson!
Nicole Anderson!
Allie Anderson!
Ed Rice!
Steven Phillips!
Monica Freeman!
And Sarah Jensen!
Hi, can I help you?
Yes.
Hello, I'm looking for Emily.
- You're a friend of hers?
- Yes, ma'am.
- She's not home.
- Oh, goodness.
No, she left this morning.
She had to do some more tests.
She asked me to watch Duke until she got back.
Okay.
You ever try mixing banana peel into the soil?
- Really?
- It works, I swear.
Oh, would you by chance know where I could find her?
Supervisor to 104.
Supervisor to 104.
Cardiac wing?
Take the elevator to the fifth floor then turn left.
Thank you.
Well, that's what I was just saying.
It's absolutely impossible.
Hold the elevator.
Thank you.
Can I help you?
Yes.
Good evening.
I'm here to see Emily Posa.
I'm sorry, visiting hours are from 8 a.m. To 4 p.m.
You know, it is really important I speak to her for just a moment.
You'll just have to come back during visiting hours.
Thank you very much.
So if there is one thing that I have learned and you all should remember about winning these contracts:
Three steps.
First, tell them what you're gonna tell them.
Step two, you tell them.
Step three, tell them what you told them.
We are gonna close by reminding them that old girl has a 3-percent better impulse from sea level to vacuum and if they pass on that, quite frankly, they deserve another Sputnik.
Now, if you will excuse me I have a very lovely, very hungry woman at home waiting for me.
Sarah.
Honey.
Everyone at work kept saying it was daylight-savings time.
You were supposed to be here a while ago.
- I kept saying it wasn't.
- This happens all the time.
It's work.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- No, I'm angry with you.
I'm gonna be angry all night long.
- I'm angry with you.
- What are you doing?
How about that?
How about I'm angry with you?
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.
It's your brother.
Where are you?
I'm at the beach house.
Are you okay?
Of course.
Listen, why'd you disconnect the landline?
The phone broke.
I don't need it anymore.
Did I?
Did I do something?
No.
Not unless you're smoking again.
No, I've put on 20 pounds.
I'm in the best shape of my life.
Are you eating?
Are you taking care of yourself?
- You sound terrible again and...
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Look, I gotta go.
Give Melanie and the kids a hug and a kiss.
I'll talk to you later.
You take care of yourself.
Hold on.
I know it's been a while, but when you were staying here you didn't take something of mine by mistake, did you?
I remember giving you something.
You remember that?
Because I remember that very clearly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just remember I love you.
Hi, my name is Ben Thomas.
I'm here to see Stewart Goodman.
Inez, look at me, please.
Inez.
I'm speaking to you.
I understand you refused to take your meds again.
Is that true?
No, no, no.
Let's try using your words this time, okay, Inez?
I mean, this silent treatment isn't doing anybody any good.
Inez, how can we help you if...?
Okay, how about I come back tomorrow and see if you've changed your mind, okay?
Thattagirl.
I thought I was coming to your office today.
I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd stop by, save you the drive.
Terrific.
Well, look, let's go talk in my office, yeah?
Come on.
I take a no-nonsense approach.
I mean, I cut the operating costs of this place over 17 percent last year alone.
- I'm sure that made them happy.
- Oh, hell, yeah.
Now, if I could only get my own finances in that kind of shape, I wouldn't have you sitting here.
No offense.
That your new Beemer out front?
Ben, I mean, when I found out that my bone-marrow transplant wasn't successful...
I'm well aware of your ongoing medical condition.
Things aren't looking very promising for me.
Look I have a bonus coming in January.
I just really need this six-month extension.
Really, I mean, I am doing the very best I can here, I promise you.
I'm gonna show myself out.
I'll be in touch.
Well, thank you.
I appreciate it.
I mean, this way everybody wins, right?
Hello.
My name is Ben.
I totally understand if you don't wanna speak to me either.
But I would really like to just have a moment of your time.
I'm trying to figure out what kind of man Stewart Goodman is.
It is within my power to drastically change his circumstances.
But I don't wanna give that man a gift that he doesn't deserve.
I need you to tell me whether or not he is a good person.
"The drug he gives me makes me dizzy.
I want a new one."
Well, that sounds very reasonable, Inez.
What else?
You can trust me.
What else, Inez?
He's punishing you?
How is he punishing you?
How is he punishing you, Inez?
Ben?
- Hey, Ben, where you going?
- Where's the washroom?
To the right.
Is there a problem?
- Give her a bath, right now.
- Absolutely.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You have the wrong impression here.
I'm gonna stop by from time to time make sure you're showing these people some respect.
Look, this is a misunderstanding, okay?
You don't treat people like that.
Let me explain, okay, Ben?
- And I'm not giving you an extension.
- Ben!
I'm not giving you anything.
I almost believed you, you son of a bitch.
I almost believed.
Okay.
Grip and rip.
This time it's gonna be a lot different.
Hey.
- Hey, Michelle.
- Hey.
- Good to see you.
- You too.
- How are you?
- I'm good.
- Hey, man.
- Hey.
What are you doing here?
Just coming to make sure that she is still kicking your ass at everything.
And I am.
- Can we have a sec, hon?
- Yeah.
All right.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm good.
You said you were gonna call me on the 15th.
- Today is the 19th.
- I know.
Doctor didn't have the results, so I had no information to give you.
Still, you should call me.
- Yeah, I know.
Yes, I know.
- We're still friends.
Right?
Yeah.
I'm just...
I'm doing some soul-searching, you know?
Don't do that.
- We have a plan.
- I know.
- Do what you promised me.
- I will.
You know, they rent clubs up at the clubhouse.
I'm well aware of that.
I think I'm gonna keep my ass unkicked today.
Were you looking at him, or were you looking at me?
Actually, I was just sitting here.
Am I doing it wrong?
I think I saw you in the elevator the other day.
Oh, yes.
Actually, you are being audited.
My name is Ben Thomas.
I'm with the IRS, and you owe the government $56, 240.19.
I know.
And now you get me.
Would you have a seat, please, Miss Posa?
So I've been looking over the income statements from the last three years.
- 2005...
- Were...?
Were you in my room the other night?
No, ma'am, I was not in your room the other night.
That's not exactly IRS protocol.
So I've been looking over '05, '06 and '07.
There seems to be quite a disparity between what you claimed and...
Mr. Thomas?
I just got discharged.
So, you know, unless you're gonna, like haul me off to some IRS jail or something I'd really like to get home now.
- Oh, sure.
No problem.
- Okay.
I'll be in touch.
Welcome to the Travel Inn.
Can I help you?
I need a room.
How many hours?
About two weeks.
Clear it!
That's it, that's it!
All right, come on!
Vamos, Manny!
All right, all right.
That's it, that's it.
Hey!
- What you want?
- Break it up!
- You want some of this?
- Get off!
Get off!
Hey, Rico, knock it off!
Somebody wanna remind Rico where we are?
The sanctuary, coach!
- I can't hear you.
- The sanctuary, coach!
That's right, Rico, in the sanctuary.
Now give me 20 starts and stops.
Hello, this is Emily Posa.
I'm not home right now, but please leave a message and I'll call you back as soon as possible.
Thank you.
Hi, my name is Susan Nall.
I'm calling because a friend told me you do letterpress invitations, and I was wondering...
Hello?
Hi, this is Emily.
Yep, I do wedding invitations.
I'm not able to take any requests, though, right now.
I know someone nearby who does it.
She's not as good as I am, but her prices are very...
Hello?
Duke?
Duke.
We're out here.
Hello, Miss Posa.
What are you doing here?
Oh, I came to see you.
Don't you people ever call ahead?
You people tend to try to hide things.
Is that meat?
No!
No, no.
No.
No meat.
No.
- Well, he was really enjoying it.
- He eats steamed broccoli and tofu.
- Why?
- He's a vegetarian.
- He is a vegetarian?
- Yes.
Well, that sucks.
Hey, can we talk?
Do you have a moment?
No.
Actually, I have to take Duke for a walk.
No problem.
I'll go with you, if you don't mind.
- So...
- Hey, hey.
Hey.
So I've been looking over 2005, 2006 and 2007.
Now...
I'm listening.
- Can I get him for you?
- Nope.
I got him.
Let me get him.
Let me get him.
Let me get him.
- You all right?
- Yes.
Whoa, sorry.
Whoa, not these.
- That's okay.
Watch...
- No, no.
Heel, heel, heel.
Yeah, maybe we shouldn't feed him meat.
So I've been looking over...
- Yeah, maybe we can do this later.
- Yeah.
So you cook it all ahead of time, I see.
No, actually.
I can't remember the last time I cooked.
This is my sister's way of looking out for me from afar.
Do you have any siblings?
Yes, one brother.
He's a...
He's a good egg.
Yeah, I just have the one sister too.
Are you receiving income from any source that the government is currently unaware of?
Well, lately I've been taking to diving in local wishing wells, so...
I mean, but it's just occasional dimes here and there or, once in a while, a quarter.
No, actually I had to refinance this place to pay my past-due medical bills.
I've been informed that you suffer from congenital heart failure.
Yes.
Did you gather that while stalking me at the hospital?
No, I...
You're currently Status 2, which means you're sick enough to be on the national UNOS waiting list but not sick enough to be admitted into the hospital and placed on Status 1.
So basically, if your heart starts to fail quickly and no donor can be located you're screwed.
Is it true that you said that you do not believe that you even deserve a heart because your life is unremarkable in every way?
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I said that.
I'm sorry.
Do you have to take any type of sensitivity training to join the IRS, Mr. Thomas?
- No, not really.
- Yeah.
So you don't consider yourself a good person?
How would you answer that question if I asked you the same?
"Unremarkable" would be an upgrade for me I assure you.
I'm gonna freeze your accounts as uncollectible until further notice.
I'm sure that'll buy you five or six months, penalty-free.
Here's my card.
If anyone from the IRS tries to contact you you call me immediately.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay.
- Mr. Thomas?
- Yes.
Why do I get the feeling you're doing me a really big favor right now?
Because I get the feeling that you really deserve it.
All right?
You off to?
You off to pollute someone else's dog now?
No.
Just going home.
Where's that?
Take care, Emily.
You too.
- What is this thing for?
- I told you already.
And why are you bringing a fish into your room?
Because it's my room.
And I don't want anyone going into my room, understood?
Well, I don't think you can keep a fish in your room.
I think I can.
Well, I've never had anybody who kept a fish in their room.
Now you do.
Who?
Good night.
The first time I ever saw a box jellyfish I was 12.
Our father took us to the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
I never forgot when he said that it was the most deadly creature on earth.
To me it was just the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.
I spoke to the doctor again.
He's gonna send over your files in the morning.
- Is this everything?
- Yeah.
- Any questions?
- Same one.
Well, same answer, then.
You know, I was thinking last night about when we were 14 and we made our big pact.
You remember on the beach in front of your grandparents' house we agreed that we would never, never date each other's girls?
I remembered that that night you told me how much you liked Stacy Miller and that you were gonna ask her out.
And I said:
"Hey, man.
You can't.
Her and I already did it."
Which we didn't, but I wanted to but she liked you way more than she liked me, and...
So I lied to you because I was so jealous.
And I realized that I've been carrying around this lie in my heart for the last 25...
Stop it!
Stop it.
Stay focused.
Do what you promised me.
- What, you think I'm...?
- Do what you promised me.
You think I'm gonna let you down now, don't you?
I've known you my whole damn life!
Okay?
This?
This?
This is not something you do every day.
Okay?
This is...
This is not easy for me.
I'll make sure everything goes as planned.
Don't worry.
Thank you.
Oh, my God.
Hello, Holly.
Look at you.
- What are you doing here?
- I came to see you.
- Really?
- You have a minute?
Sure.
Come on in.
Here's my desk.
Have a seat.
You look great.
- I do?
- Yes.
I feel great.
- How are you?
- I'm really good.
I need a favor.
Whatever you need, just ask me.
I need a name.
Someone in the system.
Someone having a really hard time that needs help, but may be too proud to ask for a handout.
What are you doing?
I'm helping.
I need a name.
Okay.
Connie Tepos.
Her boyfriend almost killed her last year when she tried to leave.
He broke three of her ribs last month.
She's scared to death to press charges and we can't do anything.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Connie Tepos?
- Yes?
My name is Ben Thomas.
I'm with the IRS.
IRS?
But I always pay my taxes.
Yes, this is more of a general inquiry.
I don't understand.
What...?
May I come in?
Not now.
My boyfriend is not here.
It's very important for your family.
For my family?
Beautiful.
Please, have a seat.
What's this all about?
Your case has come to my attention.
And I wanted to get to know you.
You wanted to get to know me?
Why?
Because I'd like to help you.
I don't understand.
I'm aware of your case.
And your boyfriend.
What are you talking about?
You know what I'm talking about.
No, I have no idea what you're talking about.
Kids, go to your room.
He's coming back?
He's not coming back.
You said you were from the IRS, but you're lying to me.
- No.
- You're not telling me the truth.
Who sent you here?
Please sit down.
I'm not going to sit down.
- Please, calm down.
- I'm not going to calm down.
You come into my house.
You talking to me about mi caso y mi boyfriend?
- Who sent you here?
- Nobody.
Nobody?
Get out of my house immediately.
You can trust me.
I trust no one, Mr. Thomas.
I talked to Holly.
I can get you out of here.
To a safe place.
A beautiful place.
Why did you talk to Holly?
Your children are in danger here.
Don't talk about my kids, Mr. Thomas.
- You don't know.
- You don't have to live like this.
Get out of my house now or I'm gonna call the police.
- Okay, okay.
- Who are you?
- I want you to take my card.
- I don't need help.
I want you to take my card, and call me...
- I don't need it.
- I'm gonna leave it.
Okay.
Thank you.
Get out right now.
- You're not helpless.
- Can you leave?
This is my house.
Please, just think about it.
I don't need you.
- I can't talk right now.
- I need to talk immediately.
- Where are you?
- I'm nowhere.
I'm gonna meet you at the house.
Look, no.
I'm not at the house.
I'm traveling.
I'll talk to you next week.
No, no, no.
We need to discuss this right now.
Wouldn't wanna get on her bad side.
- I'll sign to that.
- Yeah.
How you doing, you two?
I'm good.
Got a big day.
Yep.
No more dialysis, George.
See you in the O.R.
Yep.
- I'll see you there as well.
- Yes, sir.
Thank you.
So I heard you raised enough money to give a couple of the kids partial scholarships to college.
It's no big deal.
I just convinced a couple of bigwig donors that what the world really needs to see is more Latinos on ice.
You know, Ben, I keep asking you this but why me?
Because you are a good man.
No, really.
Even when you don't know that people are watching you.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Okay, I can't hear you, so try back again.
Gonna hang up now.
Bye.
Mr. Thomas?
We're ready for you.
These are beautiful.
Banana peels.
Who knew?
Emily?
Can I get a refill?
- Susan?
- Yeah.
How's Ryan?
He's good.
He's at his dad's this weekend.
Will you tell him for me that I'm ready whenever he is for a free lesson?
Yeah, all right.
Things are kind of crazy right now with school but maybe when school's out.
Oh, yeah.
That's perfect.
How's the pie?
Oh, it's...
It's good.
You gonna ask her out?
The waitress.
No.
You never know.
I don't...
I don't think she sees me.
Good night, Ezra.
Hello?
Ben?
Hi, I'm sorry to call so late.
Did...?
Did someone from the IRS contact you?
No.
I just...
I was having trouble breathing after I took Duke for a walk, and I fainted.
An ambulance had to take me to the hospital.
I'm so sorry.
I don't know why I even called you.
I'm sorry.
It's just that I have your card with me, and...
Ben?
Are you still there?
Yes.
Do you ever think about dying, Ben?
Every now and again.
My face is bluish.
It's not exactly a good sign.
You should try to rest.
Just...
Why don't you see if you can get some sleep?
I like talking to you.
I like talking to you too.
Would you tell me a story, please?
Okay.
All right.
Once upon a time there was a little boy named...
Oh, lucky me, you just got it on reserve like that.
Okay.
Let me guess.
His name was Ben.
No, actually, this little boy's name is Tim.
I like the name Tim.
Go on.
Tim's little brother was always pestering Tim to make him paper airplanes, because he was really good at it.
But Tim had much bigger dreams than that.
Okay.
Then what happened?
One day, Tim went out to the backyard and he put leaves and taped branches to his arms and started climbing the big oak tree.
His little brother said, "Tim, you can't fly."
And he said, "Yeah?
You just watch."
He got all the way to the top and jumped.
How tall was this tree?
It was...
It was pretty tall.
He broke his arm.
Oh, my God...
This is a horrible story.
Oh, no, no.
It gets better.
From that experience, Tim realized that he wanted to fly.
So he dedicated his life to making spaceships.
I thought you said this was a good story.
Oh, well...
Yeah, that is until the dragons showed up.
Oh, okay, see, now it's getting better.
I like dragons.
Especially dragons in space.
Yes, and these were fire-breathing space dragons with really bad attitudes.
I see.
I have an idea.
Why don't you try to fall asleep and when you do, I'll just hang up.
Okay.
Ben?
Yes.
Thank you for listening.
And for talking.
Try to fall asleep.
Good night, Ben.
Good night, Emily.
Emily?
Emily?
I lied to you.
I think about dying every day.
Dr. King to NICU.
Dr. Wesley King, please report to NICU.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
When did you get here?
Last night, after we talked.
You slept here?
Good morning.
How's our patient?
- Morning.
Better.
- Good.
- Hello.
- Hi, Ben.
Is that right?
IRS?
- Yes, how are you?
- Good, thank you.
- I'll leave you two alone.
- No, no, stay, please.
Don't go.
He can...
He can stay.
Whatever you want.
You fainted because your heart was too weak to pump enough blood to your brain.
It's enlarged and it's starting to shut down.
How long?
It's entirely up to your heart.
Could be six weeks, could be a month.
But we've upped you to Status 1 B.
At least I'm on the list.
Not only that, but we're giving you this pager.
And when it goes off, it means you have a donor.
The inotrope drug I started you on it's gonna stabilize your blood pressure within 24 hours.
Then what?
We wait.
- Can I do that at home?
- Once you're stable, you can.
Okay.
I'm gonna run to the cafeteria.
I'm gonna get you something.
If you want something else, I can get you something else.
Would you stay?
I mean, unless you have something else to do.
- I'd really like it if you stayed.
- I don't have anything.
Okay.
Okay.
Hey, hey, hey.
What the hell is that thing?
It's a dog.
Just for one night.
No.
Hold on, hold on.
I don't give two shits, okay?
We have a dog policy here.
Little dogs only.
Poodles and Shih Tzus.
It's in the contract.
It's English and Spanish for everyone to see.
And besides, that, my friend, is not a dog.
It's a goddamn horse.
Well, let me know when you add a horse policy to the contract.
Yes.
Mr. Thomas, it's Connie Tepos.
Hey, Connie.
I don't know why I'm calling you but I'm calling you.
You said you could help us and...
Can you really help us?
This just doesn't make any sense.
- What if he finds us?
- He won't.
- What makes you so sure?
- Stop it.
- You don't know him.
- Stop it.
Don't be weak.
- Don't be weak.
- I'm not weak.
I'm strong.
Take this.
Take it.
You are gonna start this car and you're gonna go.
This is real, and this is gonna be your new life.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
Look at those babies.
Look at those babies.
Look how beautiful those babies are.
I know, I know.
They deserve it.
Okay?
You're headed north up the coast.
Lorena.
Lorena.
I've always believed this place can heal the soul.
Mommy, the ocean.
Yes, the ocean.
I hope that proves true for you.
When you sign your name on the dotted line of the contract you'll own my house outright.
I only ask that you never mention how you got the house or try to contact me for any reason.
And if you're wondering why you, please stop.
All I ask is for you to honor my wishes and, of course, live life abundantly.
Hey.
Thanks.
Got it.
Hi, Duke.
Hi, baby.
What time does the nurse come?
She should be there by the time I get home.
- Ben?
- Yes.
I know I'm the girl with the broken wing.
But who are you?
Who am I?
I am your friendly neighborhood tax collector.
Ben.
Where the hell did you come from?
I grew up in Oakland.
Literally.
Okay.
Where did you go to college?
As far from Oakland as possible.
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
How about you?
UCLA.
You went to MIT?
Like, the MIT?
Oh, and now you're wondering how I wound up as a lowly tax collector.
Absolutely.
- I sort of stumbled into this job.
- That's a big stumble.
What from?
I always wanted to be an engineer.
An engineer?
What kind?
The kind that sent people to the moon.
Really?
Yes.
I don't wanna talk about me anymore.
That's too bad, because you're very interesting.
Have you...?
Have you ever been in love?
Emily, please.
Yes, you have.
Come on, you can tell me.
Yes.
But it ended.
- What happened?
- Stop it.
- No, seriously, you can tell...
- Stop it.
You need to get some rest.
I'll call you tomorrow, or maybe I'll stop by.
No, if I have questions tomorrow, what then?
That's not a part of the deal.
What the hell does that mean?
Emily, hold on.
Hold on.
- Just leave.
- Emily, wait.
Wait!
Thank you for everything you did.
Did you like the eggs?
They were okay, I guess.
I don't like the eggs you buy.
Okay.
You're wearing suit pants.
To weed.
Yeah, I didn't...
I didn't have any other clothes with me.
- You know, I was gonna get to those.
- I saw them the other day.
I figured I would just take the day off and get this done for you.
Ben?
Yeah?
This is a really ridiculous apology.
Come on.
I wanna show you something.
Oh, no, I gotta finish.
You can finish tomorrow.
Come on.
This is where I used to work.
And these are the artifacts of said work.
Wow, those are great.
How old are they?
This one is just shy of 120 years.
It's how I put out my line of letterpress cards, wedding invitations, invites.
What about this one?
That youngster is the Heidelberg Windmill, 1956.
Call it "The Beast."
Well, that seems appropriate.
It pooped out on me about five years ago, though.
And I can't find anybody to fix it.
It's kind of a dying art.
Defibrillator here works, though.
Luckily.
It kept my business afloat.
Wanna see how?
Please.
Okay.
Now, true pressmen hate that we modern girls want a deep impression.
See, for a hundred years, they tried their damnedest just to kiss it so that it didn't leave an indentation.
Now it's the only way to prove it's not digital.
I think it feels richer.
You okay?
Yeah.
Look, Ben...
I don't really know anything about you or where you came from but you keep showing up.
And I'm glad.
Okay.
Okay.
So Duke needs a walk.
Are you interested?
Yes.
Come on.
Hey, hey.
Right here.
There you go.
He's like a different dog with you around.
I don't think we ever properly bonded.
Why would you get such a big dog?
Did you know that Great Danes on average only live about seven years?
They have heart issues.
I think I got him because I thought he could help me with my illness.
It'd be something I could take care of as opposed to being always taken care of.
You know, just so you know, I used to be really hot.
Like, unauditably hot.
Is that so?
Yeah.
I haven't felt like this in a really long time.
There's so many things that I wanna do.
I wanna go on a plane for 13 hours and not have to stress that I can't reach my doctor.
You know, like, just travel.
Go backpacking, have experiences.
See the world.
I just wanna have the time to figure out who it is that I am.
You know, what I like.
Do things, try things, get out of my head for once.
I would really like to go running.
I think about that sometimes.
What it would just feel like to go running.
So see you tomorrow?
Yes.
But if you need anything, just call and I'll come right back.
Okay.
Bye.
I had a really great time today.
Me too.
Bye.
No anesthetic.
You ever donated bone marrow before?
You're a brave guy.
How long have you known Nicholas?
What the hell happened to you?
Hey, how much longer are you gonna stay in my hotel?
Motel.
How much longer?
Actually, I was planning on dying here.
Well, then you need to pay in advance.
Hello?
Hey, it's Emily.
Are you sleeping?
Yes.
No.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
My sister came over for a couple of days last week with the kids and it was really great.
I tried calling you a couple times.
How are you doing?
Yeah, I'm good.
Everything's fine.
I've been...
I've been traveling a lot, so...
Well, are you busy tonight?
What do you mean?
I don't...
Maybe you wanna come by and say hello?
Around 7?
You don't have to if you don't want to.
I just, you know...
Look, I totally get if you don't wanna hang out with the dying girl, so...
I can...
I can come at 7.
Okay.
Okay.
Bye.
- Well, how you doing tonight?
- Hey.
- How you doing?
- Have fun.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Come in.
I am so glad she's gone.
Are you okay if we eat outside?
Eating?
You didn't eat already, did you?
- No.
- Okay.
No.
Well, it was a surprise but you're on time.
I haven't cooked anybody food for years, so you better like it.
Or lie to me.
This is for you.
You don't have to say anything.
I just got it...
Change in there.
Dinner is ready and you're not.
So hurry up.
Chop-chop.
You look great.
Yeah.
It's pink.
It's salmon.
You are so nice.
So are you.
Everything's vegetarian.
I hope you like eggplant Parmesan.
I haven't treated myself very well in the past few years.
Start now.
All right.
What do you think?
It's delicious.
Glad you like it.
Do you wanna hear my favorite song?
Yes.
Are you gonna sing it?
No, I can't sing anymore.
Oh, and a performance.
Oh, no.
Shall we?
You need to relax.
This is relaxed.
I have a surprise for you.
Surprise?
Yes.
For me?
- Keep them closed.
- Okay.
And open.
Okay.
You cleaned The Beast.
Actually, I fixed it.
No, you didn't.
Oh, okay, let's go, then.
Wait.
Are you serious?
Try it.
Okay.
Thank you.
Wait right here, okay?
I'll be right back.
Wait right here.
One second.
Hey!
Tell me what's going on.
- Now!
- All right.
Ben, you need to go home.
Do you know they keep a full history of every inquiry a revenue officer makes?
- You understand?
- Keep your voice down.
- Just keep your voice down.
- No.
What you are doing is a crime!
You are impersonating a federal officer.
It's a felony!
All right.
Listen.
You can't play with people's lives.
Do you understand that?
All right.
All right, there's a coffee shop.
There's a coffee shop near where I'm staying.
- Tomorrow we'll sit down...
- Where are you staying, Tim?
Tell me, because I don't know where my brother lives!
A motel.
Five blocks from here.
We'll sit down tomorrow morning, I guarantee it.
Where are my credentials?
Give me my credentials back.
Here it is.
Here.
Here.
Just go home.
You have a beautiful family.
Go home and enjoy them.
Tim, Tim, Tim, why are you even here?
Tell me, who is Emily Posa?
I'll explain everything tomorrow.
Look, give me your car keys.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm gonna be right here.
So you remember I love you and...
Tim, don't make me come knock on the door, okay?
I didn't realize how late it was and...
I have a really long drive, so I need to go.
I don't wanna keep lying to you.
I don't wanna...
Wait, Emily.
Do you wanna play a game?
What game?
The "what if" game.
The "what if" game.
What if my pager goes off and it's a heart and it works?
And my body doesn't reject it?
And what if I have time?
What if?
What if we have children?
What if we got married?
I love you.
- I love you too.
- I love you.
Hi.
Is Dr. Briar on duty tonight?
She's doing her rounds.
Can you tell her it's Ben Thomas?
It's very important.
- I'Il...
I'll page her.
- Thank you.
Dr. Briar to the nurses' station.
Hey.
- Is it Emily?
- No, no.
I'm sorry.
It's...
Is there?
I'm sorry.
Do you have any more optimism about Emily than you did the other day?
Ben when you're looking for a donor with a rare blood type the odds go way down.
To what?
They go down.
What's the...?
Give me a percentage.
Give me a number.
Three, 5 percent.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I wish the numbers were higher.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- I do.
Hello?
Dan.
It's time.
I love you.
1:38 a.m.
Hello?
Ezra.
My name is Ben Thomas.
I called you a few weeks ago.
You probably don't remember.
I do remember.
I wanna apologize for being so cruel to you but I had to be certain.
I had to be certain that you were a decent man.
Kind.
- Slow to anger.
- What do you want from me?
I wanna give you a gift.
You're gonna be contacted by a man named Dan Morris.
You can trust him.
Was that you at the diner?
Goodbye.
911 emergency.
I need an ambulance.
I have you at 9212 West Third Street in Los Angeles.
Yes, room number 2.
What's the emergency?
There's been a suicide.
Who's the victim?
I am.
You are gonna need to stop looking at that thing so much.
Why?
Is it gonna crack?
Oh, no.
I paid extra for the non-cracking kind.
I bet you did.
- Why don't you just turn that off?
- I know.
No more.
No more work.
I'm done.
Almost done.
Almost done.
Tim!
I have procedures.
I understand, but she needs that heart or she will die.
- Ben?
- One, two, three.
Hey.
How you doing?
About a year after the accident, I got sick.
I got lung cancer, and I needed a double-Iobe transplant.
Tim could only give me one, of course.
It must have planted a seed, because he...
About six months later he donated the right part of his liver to this woman.
Her name is Holly.
I'm proud of you kids.
Very proud.
Good job.
Good job.
- Ezra.
- Yeah.
Hi.
Are you a parent?
No.
Have we met?
You okay?
You must be Emily.
Yes.
It's so nice to meet you.

I--
You're trying to help me?
The blind beef salesman is trying to help me?
I'm actually starting to feel pretty bad for you, Ezra.
Because I look at my life and it is surrounded by so much beauty, and you can't see shit.

Does that seem fair to you, Ezra?

So we are gonna close by reminding them that old girl here has a 3 percent better specific impulse from sea level to vacuum, and if they pass on that, quite frankly, they deserve another sputnik.

Is that true?
No, no, no.
Let's try using your words this time, okay, Inez?
I mean, this silent treatment isn't doing anybody any good.
Inez, how can we help you if--?
Okay, how about I come back tomorrow, and see if you've changed your mind?
Okay?

I thought I was coming to your office today.
Uh, yes, I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd, uh, stop by, save you the drive.
Terrific.
Well, look, let's go talk in my office, yeah?
Come on.
I take a no-nonsense approach.
I mean, I cut the operating costs of this place over 17 percent last year alone.
I'm sure that made them happy.
[CHUCKLES] Oh, hell, yeah.
Now, if I could only get my own personal finances in that kind of shape, I wouldn't have you sitting here.
No offense.

I have a bonus coming in January.
I just really need this six-month extension.
[LAUGHS NERVOUSLY] Really, I mean,
I am doing the very best I can here, I promise you.

I had to refinance this place to pay my past-due medical bills.
I've been informed that you suffer from congenital heart failure.
Yes.
Uh, did you gather that while stalking me at the hospital?
Uh, no, I, uh...
[CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY]
You're currently Status Two, uh, which means you're sick enough to be on the national UNOS waiting list, but not sick enough to be admitted into the hospital and placed on Status One.
So basically, if your heart starts to fail quickly and no donor can be located,
you're screwed.
Mm-hm.
Is it true that you said that you do not believe that you even deserve a heart because your life is unremarkable in every way?
I'm sorry.
Um...
I don't know why I said that.
I'm sorry.
Do you have to take any type of, um, sensitivity training to join the IRS, Mr. Thomas?
No, not really.
Yeah.
So you don't consider yourself a good person?
How would you answer that question if I asked you the same?
"Unremarkable" would be an upgrade for me,
I assure you.
I'm gonna freeze your accounts as uncollectible until further notice.
I'm sure that'll buy you five or six months, penalty-free.
Here's my card.
If anyone from the IRS tries to contact you, you call me immediately.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay.
Mr. Thomas?
Yes.
Um...
[SIGHS] ...uh, why do I get the feeling you're doing me a really big favor right now?
Because I get the feeling that you really deserve it.

Good night.
BEN:
The first time I ever saw a box jellyfish,
I was 12.
Our father took us to the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
I never forgot when he said that it was the most deadly creature on earth.
To me it was just the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.
I spoke to the doctor again.
He's gonna send over your files in the morning.
BEN:
Is this everything?
Yeah.
Any questions?
Same one.
[CLEARS THROAT] Well, same answer, then.
You know, I was thinking last night about when we were 14 and we made our-- Our big pact.
You remember on the-
- On the beach in front of your grandparents' house, we--
We agreed that we would never, never date each other's girls?
And I remembered that that night you told me how much you liked Stacy Miller, and that you were gonna ask her out.
And I said, "Whoa.
Hey, man.
You can't.
I-
- Her and I already did it."
Which we didn't, but-
- I wanted to, but she liked you way more than she liked me, and so I lied to you because I was so jealous.
And I realized that I've been carrying around this--
This lie in my heart for the last 25--
Stop it.
Stop it.
Stay focused.
Do what you promised me.
What, you--?
You think I'm--?
Do what you promised me.
You think I'm gonna let you down now, don't you?
I've known you my whole damn life!
Okay?
This-
- This-
- This is not something you do every day.
Okay?
This is-- This is not easy for me.
I'll make sure everything goes as planned.
Don't worry.

Hi, I'm sorry to call so late.
Uh, did--?
Did someone from the IRS contact you?
No.
Um,
I just--
I was having trouble breathing after I took Duke for a walk, and I fainted.
An ambulance had to take me to the hospital.
[SOBBING] I'm so sorry.
I--
I don't know why I even called you.
I'm sorry.
It's just that I have your card with me and...
Ben?
Are you still there?
Yes.
Do you ever think about dying, Ben?
Every now and again.
My face is, um, bluish.
It's not exactly a good sign.
You should try to rest.
Just--
Why don't you see if you can get some sleep?
I like talking to you.
I like talking to you too.
[SNIFFLES]
Would you tell me a story, please?
Okay.
Um...
All right.
Once upon a time, there was, um, a little boy named--
Oh, lucky me, you just got it on reserve like that.
Okay.
Let me guess.
His name was Ben.
[CHUCKLES]
No, actually, this little boy's name is Tim.
I like the name Tim.
Go on.
Tim's little brother was always pestering Tim to make him paper airplanes, uh, because he was really good at it.
But Tim had much bigger dreams than that.
Okay.
Then what happened?
Uh, one day, Tim went out to the backyard and he put leaves and-- And taped branches to his arms and started climbing the big oak tree.
His little brother said, "Tim, you can't fly."
And he said, "Yeah?
You just watch."
He got all the way to the top and jumped.
How tall was this tree?
Um-
- Uh, it was-- It was pretty tall.
He broke his arm.
Oh, my God-- This is a horrible story.
Oh, no, no.
It gets better.
Uh, from that experience,
Tim realized that he wanted to fly.
So he dedicated his life to making spaceships.
I thought you said this was a good story.
Oh, well...
Yeah, that is, until the-
- The dragons showed up.
Oh, okay, see, now it's getting better.
I like dragons.
Especially dragons in space.
Yes, and these-
- These were fire-breathing space dragons with really bad attitudes.
I see.
I have an idea.
Why don't you try to fall asleep, and when you do, I'll just hang up.
Okay.
Ben?
Yes.
Thank you for listening.
And for talking.

You fainted because your heart was too weak to pump enough blood to your brain.
It's enlarged and it's starting to shut down.
How long?
It's entirely up to your heart.
Could be six weeks, could be a month.
But we've upped you to Status 1B.
At least I'm on the list.
Not only that, but we're giving you this pager.
And when it goes off, it means you have a donor.

It's five blocks from here.
We'll sit down tomorrow morning, I guarantee it.
Where are my credentials?
Give me my credentials back.
Here it is.

You have a beautiful family.
Go home and enjoy them.

Tell me, who--?

Who is Emily Posa?
I'll explain everything tomorrow.
Look, g-g-give me your car keys.
[KEYS JANGLING]
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm gonna be right here.
So you remember I love you and...
Tim, don't make me come knock on the door, okay?
Uh...
I didn't realize how late it was and...
I have a really long drive, so I need to go.
I don't wanna keep lying to you.

When you're looking for a donor with a rare blood type, the odds go way down.
To what?
They go down.
What's the--?

Okay.
9 1 1 emergency.
I need an ambulance.
I have you at 92 1 2 West Third Street in Los Angeles.
Yes, room number 2.
What's the emergency?
There's been a suicide.
Who's the victim?
I am.
In seven days, God created the world.
And in seven seconds I shattered mine.
-I can have four new fillets overnight.
-Oh, no.
No, thank you.
What is your name again?
Ezra?
Is that right?
Yes, sir.
I'II just need your first and last name...
-...so I can call up your account.
-You know what?
Here's what I'm thinking, Ezra.
I think I'm gonna mail you the meat back so you can see firsthand the type of dog food that you're peddling.
That won't be necessary, sir.
So how about we just start with your last name?
Thomas.
And don't even get me started on the pork.
-Have you tried the pork?
-Well, no, sir.
I'm not much of a meat eater myself, but I hear really great things about the pork.
-Oh, so you don't eat pork at all?
-No, sir.
Are you Jewish?
Is that why you don't eat pork, Ezra?
well, can we--?
What's your first name, Mr. Thomas?
Ben.
hold on, what was that voice?
I don't-
- I don't have an order for a Ben Thomas.
Ezra, what was that voice?
-What voice?
-Are you blind?
-Excuse me?
-You're kidding me.
A blind beef salesman who doesn't eat meat.
Now, that-
- That is rich.
That is rich.
Have you ever had sex, Ezra?
Did Lawrence in Accounting put you up to this?
Because somehow I can't imagine the blind, vegan beef salesman having sex.
-Listen, I'm trying to help you, sir.
-You're trying to help me?
The blind beef salesman is trying to help me?
I'm actually starting to feel pretty bad for you, Ezra.
Because I Iook at my Iife, and it is surrounded by so much beauty and you can't see shit.
Is that fair?
Does that seem fair to you, Ezra?
Do you even know what color the ocean is?
Do you?
-It's blue, sir.
-"It's blue, sir. "
Say what you wanna say.

Say what you wanna say to me.
Thank you for calling Cheyenne Meats.

-You're a friend of hers?
-Yes, ma'am.
-She's not home.
-Oh, goodness.
No, she left this morning.
She had to do some more tests.
She asked me to watch Duke until she got back.
Okay.
You ever try mixing banana peel into the soil?
-really?
-It works, I swear.
Oh, would you by chance know where I couId find her?

Thank you.
well, that's what I was just saying.
It's absolutely impossible.
hold the elevator.
Thank you.
Can I help you?
Yes.
Good evening.
I'm here to see emily Posa.
I'm sorry, visiting hours are from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.
You know, it is really important I speak to her for just a moment.
You'II just have to come back during visiting hours.
Thank you very much.
So if there is one thing that I have learned and you all should remember about winning these contracts:
Three steps.
First, tell them what you're gonna tell them.
Step two, you tell them.
Step three, tell them what you told them.
We are gonna close by reminding them that old girl has a 3-percent better impulse from sea level to vacuum and if they pass on that, quite frankly, they deserve another Sputnik.
Now, if you will excuse me I have a very lovely, very hungry woman at home waiting for me.
Sarah.
Honey.
Everyone at work kept saying it was dayIight-savings time.
You were supposed to be here a while ago.
-I kept saying it wasn't.
-This happens all the time.
It's work.
-I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
-No, I'm angry with you.
I'm gonna be angry all night long.
-I'm angry with you.
-What are you doing?
How about that?
How about I'm angry with you?
-hello?
-Hey, it's me.
It's your brother.
Where are you?
I'm at the beach house.
Are you okay?
Of course.
Listen, why'd you disconnect the landline?
The phone broke.
I don't need it anymore.
Did I...?
Did I do something?
No.
Not unless you're smoking again.
No, I've put on 20 pounds.
I'm in the best shape of my Iife.
Are you eating?
Are you taking care of yourself?
-You sound terrible again and--
-Yeah, I'm fine.
Look, I gotta go.
Give melanie and the kids a hug and a kiss.
I'II talk to you later.
You take care of yourself.
hold on.
I know it's been a while, but when you were staying here you didn't take something of mine by mistake, did you?
I remember giving you something.
You remember that?
Because I remember that very clearly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just remember I Iove you.
Hi, my name is Ben Thomas.
I'm here to see Stewart Goodman.
Inez, look at me, please.
Inez.
I'm speaking to you.
I understand you refused to take your meds again.
Is that true?
No, no, no.
Let's try using your words this time, okay, Inez?
I mean, this silent treatment isn't doing anybody any good.
Inez, how can we help you if--?
Okay, how about I come back tomorrow and see if you've changed your mind, okay?
ThattagirI.
I thought I was coming to your office today.
I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd stop by, save you the drive.
Terrific.
well, look, Iet's go talk in my office, yeah?
Come on.
I take a no-nonsense approach.
I mean, I cut the operating costs of this place over 1 7 percent last year alone.
-I'm sure that made them happy.
-Oh, hell, yeah.
Now, if I couId only get my own finances in that kind of shape, I wouldn't have you sitting here.
No offense.
That your new Beemer out front?
Ben, I mean, when I found out that my bone-marrow transplant wasn't successfuI--
I'm well aware of your ongoing medical condition.
Things aren't looking very promising for me.
Look I have a bonus coming in January.
I just really need this six-month extension.
really, I mean, I am doing the very best I can here, I promise you.
I'm gonna show myself out.
I'II be in touch.
well, thank you.
I appreciate it.
I mean, this way everybody wins, right?
hello.
My name is Ben.
I totally understand if you don't wanna speak to me either.
But I would really like to just have a moment of your time.
I'm trying to figure out what kind of man Stewart Goodman is.
It is within my power to drastically change his circumstances.
But I don't wanna give that man a gift that he doesn't deserve.
I need you to tell me whether or not he is a good person.
"The drug he gives me makes me dizzy.
I want a new one."
well, that sounds very reasonable, Inez.
What else?
You can trust me.
What else, Inez?
He's punishing you?
How is he punishing you?
How is he punishing you, Inez?
Ben?
-Hey, Ben, where you going?
-Where's the washroom?
To the right.
Is there a problem?
-Give her a bath, right now.
-absolutely.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You have the wrong impression here.
I'm gonna stop by from time to time make sure you're showing these people some respect.
Look, this is a misunderstanding, okay?
You don't treat people like that.
Let me explain, okay, Ben?
-And I'm not giving you an extension.
-Ben!
I'm not giving you anything.
I almost believed you, you son of a bitch.
I almost believed.
Okay.
Grip and rip.
This time it's gonna be a Iot different.
Hey.
-Hey, michelle.
-Hey.
-Good to see you.
-You too.
-How are you?
-I'm good.
-Hey, man.
-Hey.
What are you doing here?
Just coming to make sure that she is still kicking your ass at everything.
And I am.
-Can we have a sec, hon?
-Yeah.
AII right.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm good.
You said you were gonna call me on the 1 5th.
-Today is the 1 9th.
-I know.
Doctor didn't have the results, so I had no information to give you.
still, you should call me.
-Yeah, I know.
Yes, I know.
-We're still friends.
Right?
Yeah.
I'm just....
I'm doing some souI-searching, you know?
Don't do that.
-We have a plan.
-I know.
-Do what you promised me.
-I will.
You know, they rent clubs up at the clubhouse.
I'm well aware of that.
I think I'm gonna keep my ass unkicked today.
Were you looking at him, or were you looking at me?
actually, I was just sitting here.
Am I doing it wrong?
I think I saw you in the elevator the other day.
Oh, yes.
actually, you are being audited.
My name is Ben Thomas.
I'm with the IRS, and you owe the government $56, 2 40.1 9.
I know.
And now you get me.
would you have a seat, please, Miss Posa?
So I've been looking over the income statements from the Iast three years.
-2005--
-Were--?
Were you in my room the other night?
No, ma'am, I was not in your room the other night.
That's not exactly IRS protocol.
So I've been looking over '05, '06 and '0 7.
There seems to be quite a disparity between what you claimed and--
Mr. Thomas?
I just got discharged.
So, you know, unless you're gonna, Iike haul me off to some IRS jail or something I'd really like to get home now.
-Oh, sure.
No problem.
-Okay.
I'II be in touch.
welcome to the travel Inn.
Can I help you?
I need a room.
How many hours?
About two weeks.
clear it!
That's it, that's it!
AII right, come on!
Vamos, Manny!
AII right, all right.
That's it, that's it.
Hey!
-What you want?
-Break it up!
-You want some of this?
-Get off!
Get off!
Hey, Rico, knock it off!
Somebody wanna remind Rico where we are?
The sanctuary, coach!
-I can't hear you.
-The sanctuary, coach!
That's right, Rico, in the sanctuary.
Now give me 20 starts and stops.
Hello, this is Emily Posa.
I'm not home right now, but please leave a message and I'll call you back as soon as possible.
Thank you.
Hi, my name is Susan Nall.
I'm calling because a friend told me you do letterpress invitations, and I was wondering--
hello?
Hi, this is emily.
Yep, I do wedding invitations.
I'm not able to take any requests, though, right now.
I know someone nearby who does it.
She's not as good as I am, but her prices are very--
hello?
Duke?
Duke.
We're out here.
hello, Miss Posa.
What are you doing here?
Oh, I came to see you.
Don't you people ever call ahead?
You people tend to try to hide things.
Is that meat?
No!
No, no.
No.
No meat.
No.
-well, he was really enjoying it.
-He eats steamed broccoli and tofu.
-Why?
-He's a vegetarian.
-He is a vegetarian?
-Yes.
well, that sucks.
Hey, can we talk?
Do you have a moment?
No.
actually, I have to take Duke for a walk.
No problem.
I'II go with you, if you don't mind.
-So--
-Hey, hey.
Hey.
So I've been looking over 2005, 2006 and 200 7.
Now--
I'm listening.
-Can I get him for you?
-Nope.
I got him.
Let me get him.
Let me get him.
Let me get him.
-You all right?
-Yes.
Whoa, sorry.
Whoa, not these.
-That's okay.
Watch--
-No, no.
heel, heel, heel.
Yeah, maybe we shouldn't feed him meat.
So I've been looking over--
-Yeah, maybe we can do this later.
-Yeah.
So you cook it all ahead of time, I see.
No, actually.
I can't remember the Iast time I cooked.
This is my sister's way of looking out for me from afar.
Do you have any siblings?
Yes, one brother.
He's a-
- He's a good egg.
Yeah, I just have the one sister too.
Are you receiving income from any source that the government is currently unaware of?
well, lately I've been taking to diving in local wishing wells, so....
I mean, but it's just occasional dimes here and there or, once in a while, a quarter.
No, actually I had to refinance this place to pay my past-due medical bills.
I've been informed that you suffer from congenital heart failure.
Yes.
Did you gather that while stalking me at the hospital?
No, I....
You're currently Status 2, which means you're sick enough to be on the national UNOS waiting list but not sick enough to be admitted into the hospital and placed on Status 1 .
So basically, if your heart starts to fall quickly and no donor can be located you're screwed.
Is it true that you said that you do not believe that you even deserve a heart because your life is unremarkable in every way?
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I said that.
I'm sorry.
Do you have to take any type of sensitivity training to join the IRS, Mr. Thomas?
-No, not really.
-Yeah.
So you don't consider yourself a good person?
How would you answer that question if I asked you the same?
"unremarkable" would be an upgrade for me I assure you.
I'm gonna freeze your accounts as uncollectible until further notice.
I'm sure that'II buy you five or six months, penaIty-free.
Here's my card.
If anyone from the IRS tries to contact you you call me immediately.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay.
-Mr.
Thomas?
-Yes.
Why do I get the feeling you're doing me a really big favor right now?
Because I get the feeling that you really deserve it.
AII right?
You off to...?
You off to pollute someone else's dog now?
No.
Just going home.
Where's that?
Take care, emily.
You too.
-What is this thing for?
-I told you already.
And why are you bringing a fish into your room?
Because it's my room.
And I don't want anyone going into my room, understood?
well, I don't think you can keep a fish in your room.
I think I can.
well, I've never had anybody who kept a fish in their room.
Now you do.
Who?
Good night.
The first time I ever saw a box jellyfish I was 1 2.
Our father took us to the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
I never forgot when he said that it was the most deadly creature on earth.
To me it was just the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.
I spoke to the doctor again.
He's gonna send over your files in the morning.
-Is this everything?
-Yeah.
-Any questions?
-Same one.
well, same answer, then.
You know, I was thinking last night about when we were 1 4 and we made our big pact.
You remember on the beach in front of your grandparents' house we agreed that we would never, never date each other's girls?
I remembered that that night you told me how much you liked Stacy miller and that you were gonna ask her out.
And I said:
"Hey, man.
You can't.
Her and I already did it."
Which we didn't, but I wanted to but she liked you way more than she liked me, and....
So I lied to you because I was so jealous.
And I realized that I've been carrying around this lie in my heart for the Iast 25--
Stop it!
Stop it.
Stay focused.
Do what you promised me.
-What, you think I'm--?
-Do what you promised me.
You think I'm gonna let you down now, don't you?
I've known you my whole damn life!
Okay?
This?
This?
This is not something you do every day.
Okay?
This is-- This is not easy for me.
I'II make sure everything goes as planned.
Don't worry.
Thank you.
Oh, my God.
hello, holly.
Look at you.
-What are you doing here?
-I came to see you.
-really?
-You have a minute?
Sure.
Come on in.
Here's my desk.
Have a seat.
You look great.
-I do?
-Yes.
I feel great.
-How are you?
-I'm really good.
I need a favor.
Whatever you need, just ask me.
I need a name.
Someone in the system.
Someone having a really hard time that needs help, but may be too proud to ask for a handout.
What are you doing?
I'm helping.
I need a name.
Okay.
Connie Tepos.
Her boyfriend almost killed her last year when she tried to leave.
He broke three of her ribs last month.
She's scared to death to press charges and we can't do anything.
-hello.
-Hi.
-Connie Tepos?
-Yes?
My name is Ben Thomas.
I'm with the IRS.
IRS?
But I always pay my taxes.
Yes, this is more of a general inquiry.
I don't understand.
What--?
May I come in?
Not now.
My boyfriend is not here.
It's very important for your family.
For my family?
beautiful.
please, have a seat.
What's this all about?
Your case has come to my attention.
And I wanted to get to know you.
You wanted to get to know me?
Why?
Because I'd Iike to help you.
I don't understand.
I'm aware of your case.
And your boyfriend.
What are you talking about?
You know what I'm talking about.
No, I have no idea what you're talking about.
Kids, go to your room.
He's coming back?
He's not coming back.
You said you were from the IRS, but you're lying to me.
-No.
-You're not telling me the truth.
Who sent you here?
please sit down.
I'm not going to sit down.
-please, calm down.
-I'm not going to calm down.
You come into my house.
You talking to me about mi caso y mi boyfriend?
-Who sent you here?
-Nobody.
Nobody?
Get out of my house immediately.
You can trust me.
I trust no one, Mr. Thomas.
I talked to holly.
I can get you out of here.
To a safe place.
A beautiful place.
Why did you talk to holly?
Your children are in danger here.
Don't talk about my kids, Mr. Thomas.
-You don't know.
-You don't have to live like this.
Get out of my house now or I'm gonna call the police.
-Okay, okay.
-Who are you?
-I want you to take my card.
-I don't need help.
I want you to take my card, and call me--
-I don't need it.
-I'm gonna leave it.
Okay.
Thank you.
Get out right now.
-You're not helpless.
-Can you leave?
This is my house.
please, just think about it.
I don't need you.
-I can't talk right now.
-I need to talk immediately.
-Where are you?
-I'm nowhere.
I'm gonna meet you at the house.
Look, no.
I'm not at the house.
I'm traveling.
I'II talk to you next week.
No, no, no.
We need to discuss this right now.
WouIdn't wanna get on her bad side.
-I'II sign to that.
-Yeah.
How you doing, you two?
I'm good.
Got a big day.
Yep.
No more dialysis, George.
See you in the O.R.
Yep.
-I'II see you there as well.
-Yes, sir.
Thank you.
So I heard you raised enough money to give a couple of the kids partial scholarships to college.
It's no big deal.
I just convinced a couple of bigwig donors that what the world really needs to see is more Latinos on ice.
You know, Ben, I keep asking you this but why me?
Because you are a good man.
No, really.
Even when you don't know that people are watching you.
Hello?
hello?
hello?
Okay, I can't hear you, so try back again.
Gonna hang up now.
Bye.
Mr. Thomas?
We're ready for you.
These are beautiful.
Banana peels.
Who knew?
emily?
Can I get a refill?
-Susan?
-Yeah.
How's Ryan?
He's good.
He's at his dad's this weekend.
will you tell him for me that I'm ready whenever he is for a free lesson?
Yeah, all right.
Things are kind of crazy right now with school but maybe when school's out.
Oh, yeah.
That's perfect.
How's the pie?
Oh, it's-
- It's good.
You gonna ask her out?
The waitress.
No.
You never know.
I don't-
- I don't think she sees me.
Good night, Ezra.
hello?
Ben?
Hi, I'm sorry to call so late.
Did--?
Did someone from the IRS contact you?
No.
I just--
I was having trouble breathing after I took Duke for a walk, and I fainted.
An ambulance had to take me to the hospital.
I'm so sorry.
I don't know why I even called you.
I'm sorry.
It's just that I have your card with me, and....
Ben?
Are you still there?
Yes.
Do you ever think about dying, Ben?
Every now and again.
My face is bluish.
It's not exactly a good sign.
You should try to rest.
Just--
Why don't you see if you can get some sleep?
I Iike talking to you.
I like talking to you too.
would you tell me a story, please?
Okay.
AII right.
Once upon a time there was a little boy named--
Oh, lucky me, you just got it on reserve like that.
Okay.
Let me guess.
His name was Ben.
No, actually, this little boy's name is Tim.
I Iike the name Tim.
Go on.
Tim's little brother was always pestering Tim to make him paper airplanes, because he was really good at it.
But Tim had much bigger dreams than that.
Okay.
Then what happened?
One day, Tim went out to the backyard and he put leaves and taped branches to his arms and started climbing the big oak tree.
His little brother said, "Tim, you can't fly. "
And he said, "Yeah?
You just watch. "
He got all the way to the top and jumped.
How tall was this tree?
It was-
- It was pretty tall.
He broke his arm.
Oh, my God-- This is a horrible story.
Oh, no, no.
It gets better.
From that experience, Tim realized that he wanted to fly.
So he dedicated his life to making spaceships.
I thought you said this was a good story.
Oh, well....
Yeah, that is until the dragons showed up.
Oh, okay, see, now it's getting better.
I Iike dragons.
especially dragons in space.
Yes, and these were fire-breathing space dragons with really bad attitudes.
I see.
I have an idea.
Why don't you try to fall asleep and when you do, I'll just hang up.
Okay.
Ben?
Yes.
Thank you for listening.
And for talking.
Try to fall asleep.
Good night, Ben.
Good night, emily.
emily?
emily?
I lied to you.
I think about dying every day.
Dr. King to NICU.
Dr. Wesley King, please report to NICU.
Hey.
-Hey.
-Hey.
When did you get here?
Last night, after we talked.
You slept here?
Good morning.
How's our patient?
-Morning.
Better.
-Good.
-hello.
-Hi, Ben.
Is that right?
IRS?
-Yes, how are you?
-Good, thank you.
-I'II leave you two alone.
-No, no, stay, please.
Don't go.
He can-
- He can stay.
Whatever you want.
You fainted because your heart was too weak to pump enough blood to your brain.
It's enlarged and it's starting to shut down.
How long?
It's entirely up to your heart.
could be six weeks, could be a month.
But we've upped you to Status 1 B.
At least I'm on the list.
Not only that, but we're giving you this pager.
And when it goes off, it means you have a donor.
The inotrope drug I started you on it's gonna stabilize your blood pressure within 2 4 hours.
Then what?
We wait.
-Can I do that at home?
-Once you're stable, you can.
Okay.
I'm gonna run to the cafeteria.
I'm gonna get you something.
If you want something else, I can get you something else.
would you stay?
I mean, unless you have something else to do.
-I'd really like it if you stayed.
-I don't have anything.
Okay.
Okay.
Hey, hey, hey.
What the hell is that thing?
It's a dog.
Just for one night.
No.
hold on, hold on.
I don't give two shits, okay?
We have a dog policy here.
little dogs only.
PoodIes and Shih Tzus.
It's in the contract.
It's english and Spanish for everyone to see.
And besides, that, my friend, is not a dog.
It's a goddamn horse.
well, Iet me know when you add a horse policy to the contract.
Yes.
Mr. Thomas, it's Connie Tepos.
Hey, Connie.
I don't know why I'm calling you but I'm calling you.
You said you could help us and--
Can you really help us?
This just doesn't make any sense.
-What if he finds us?
-He won't.
-What makes you so sure?
-Stop it.
-You don't know him.
-Stop it.
Don't be weak.
-Don't be weak.
-I'm not weak.
I'm strong.
Take this.
Take it.
You are gonna start this car and you're gonna go.
This is real, and this is gonna be your new life.
-Do you understand?
-Yes.
Look at those babies.
Look at those babies.
Look how beautiful those babies are.
I know, I know.
They deserve it.
Okay?
You're headed north up the coast.
Lorena.
Lorena.
I've always believed this place can heal the soul.
Mommy, the ocean.
Yes, the ocean.
I hope that proves true for you.
When you sign your name on the dotted line of the contract you'll own my house outright.
I only ask that you never mention how you got the house or try to contact me for any reason.
And if you're wondering why you, please stop.
All I ask is for you to honor my wishes and, of course, live life abundantly.
Hey.
Thanks.
Got it.
Hi, Duke.
Hi, baby.
What time does the nurse come?
She should be there by the time I get home.
-Ben?
-Yes.
I know I'm the girl with the broken wing.
But who are you?
Who am I?
I am your friendly neighborhood tax collector.
Ben.
Where the hell did you come from?
I grew up in oakland.
literally.
Okay.
Where did you go to college?
As far from oakland as possible.
Massachusetts Institute of technology.
How about you?
UCLA.
You went to MIT?
Like, the MIT?
Oh, and now you're wondering how I wound up as a lowly tax collector.
absolutely.
-I sort of stumbled into this job.
-That's a big stumble.
What from?
I always wanted to be an engineer.
An engineer?
What kind?
The kind that sent people to the moon.
really?
Yes.
I don't wanna talk about me anymore.
That's too bad, because you're very interesting.
Have you--?
Have you ever been in love?
emily, please.
Yes, you have.
Come on, you can tell me.
Yes.
But it ended.
-What happened?
-Stop it.
-No, seriously, you can teII--
-Stop it.
You need to get some rest.
I'II call you tomorrow, or maybe I'II stop by.
No, if I have questions tomorrow, what then?
That's not a part of the deal.
What the hell does that mean?
emily, hold on.
hold on.
-Just leave.
-emily, wait.
Wait!
Thank you for everything you did.
Did you Iike the eggs?
They were okay, I guess.
I don't like the eggs you buy.
Okay.
You're wearing suit pants.
To weed.
Yeah, I didn't-
- I didn't have any other clothes with me.
-You know, I was gonna get to those.
-I saw them the other day.
I figured I would just take the day off and get this done for you.
Ben?
Yeah?
This is a really ridiculous apology.
Come on.
I wanna show you something.
Oh, no, I gotta finish.
You can finish tomorrow.
Come on.
This is where I used to work.
And these are the artifacts of said work.
Wow, those are great.
How old are they?
This one is just shy of 1 20 years.
It's how I put out my line of letterpress cards, wedding invitations, invites.
What about this one?
That youngster is the HeideIberg windmill, 1 956.
call it "The Beast."
well, that seems appropriate.
It pooped out on me about five years ago, though.
And I can't find anybody to fix it.
It's kind of a dying art.
defibrillator here works, though.
luckily.
It kept my business afloat.
Wanna see how?
please.
Okay.
Now, true pressmen hate that we modern girls want a deep impression.
See, for a hundred years, they tried their damnedest just to kiss it so that it didn't leave an indentation.
Now it's the only way to prove it's not digital.
I think it feels richer.
You okay?
Yeah.
Look, Ben....
I don't really know anything about you or where you came from but you keep showing up.
And I'm glad.
Okay.
Okay.
So Duke needs a walk.
Are you interested?
Yes.
Come on.
Hey, hey.
Right here.
There you go.
He's like a different dog with you around.
I don't think we ever properly bonded.
Why would you get such a big dog?
Did you know that Great Danes on average only live about seven years?
They have heart issues.
I think I got him because I thought he could help me with my illness.
It'd be something I couId take care of as opposed to being always taken care of.
You know, just so you know, I used to be really hot.
Like, unauditabIy hot.
Is that so?
Yeah.
I haven't felt like this in a really long time.
There's so many things that I wanna do.
I wanna go on a plane for 1 3 hours and not have to stress that I can't reach my doctor.
You know, Iike, just travel.
Go backpacking, have experiences.
See the world.
I just wanna have the time to figure out who it is that I am.
You know, what I Iike.
Do things, try things, get out of my head for once.
I would really like to go running.
I think about that sometimes.
What it wouId just feel like to go running.
So see you tomorrow?
Yes.
But if you need anything, just call and I'II come right back.
Okay.
Bye.
I had a really great time today.
Me too.
Bye.
No anesthetic.
You ever donated bone marrow before?
You're a brave guy.
How long have you known NichoIas?
What the hell happened to you?
Hey, how much longer are you gonna stay in my hotel?
motel.
How much longer?
actually, I was planning on dying here.
well, then you need to pay in advance.
hello?
Hey, it's emily.
Are you sleeping?
Yes.
No.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
My sister came over for a couple of days last week with the kids and it was really great.
I tried calling you a couple times.
How are you doing?
Yeah, I'm good.
Everything's fine.
I've been....
I've been traveling a Iot, so....
well, are you busy tonight?
What do you mean?
I don't-
- Maybe you wanna come by and say hello?
Around 7?
You don't have to if you don't want to.
I just, you know....
Look, I totally get if you don't wanna hang out with the dying girl, so....
I can-
- I can come at 7.
Okay.
Okay.
Bye.
-well, how you doing tonight?
-Hey.
-How you doing?
-Have fun.
-Hi.
-Hi.
Come in.
I am so glad she's gone.
Are you okay if we eat outside?
Eating?
You didn't eat already, did you?
-No.
-Okay.
No.
well, it was a surprise but you're on time.
I haven't cooked anybody food for years, so you better like it.
Or lie to me.
This is for you.
You don't have to say anything.
I just got it-
- Change in there.
Dinner is ready and you're not.
So hurry up.
Chop-chop.
You look great.
Yeah.
It's pink.
It's salmon.
You are so nice.
So are you.
Everything's vegetarian.
I hope you Iike eggplant Parmesan.
I haven't treated myself very well in the past few years.
Start now.
AII right.
What do you think?
It's delicious.
glad you Iike it.
Do you wanna hear my favorite song?
Yes.
Are you gonna sing it?
No, I can't sing anymore.
Oh, and a performance.
Oh, no.
shall we?
You need to relax.
This is relaxed.
I have a surprise for you.
Surprise?
Yes.
For me?
-Keep them closed.
-Okay.
And open.
Okay.
You cleaned The Beast.
actually, I fixed it.
No, you didn't.
Oh, okay, Iet's go, then.
Wait.
Are you serious?
Try it.
Okay.
Thank you.
Wait right here, okay?
I'II be right back.
Wait right here.
One second.
Hey!
tell me what's going on.
-Now!
-AII right.
Ben, you need to go home.
Do you know they keep a full history of every inquiry a revenue officer makes?
-You understand?
-Keep your voice down.
-Just keep your voice down.
-No.
What you are doing is a crime!
You are impersonating a federal officer.
It's a felony!
AII right.
Listen.
You can't play with people's lives.
Do you understand that?
AII right.
AII right, there's a coffee shop.
There's a coffee shop near where I'm staying.
-Tomorrow we'II sit down--
-Where are you staying, Tim?
tell me, because I don't know where my brother lives!
A motel.
Five blocks from here.
We'II sit down tomorrow morning, I guarantee it.
Where are my credentials?
Give me my credentials back.
Here it is.
Here.
Here.
Just go home.
You have a beautiful family.
Go home and enjoy them.
Tim, Tim, Tim, why are you even here?
tell me, who is emily Posa?
I'II explain everything tomorrow.
Look, give me your car keys.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm gonna be right here.
So you remember I Iove you and....
Tim, don't make me come knock on the door, okay?
I didn't realize how late it was and....
I have a really long drive, so I need to go.
I don't wanna keep lying to you.
I don't wanna-
- Wait, emily.
Do you wanna play a game?
What game?
The "what if" game.
The "what if" game.
What if my pager goes off and it's a heart and it works?
And my body doesn't reject it?
And what if I have time?
What if...?
What if we have children?
What if we got married?
I Iove you.
-I Iove you too.
-I Iove you.
Hi.
Is Dr. Briar on duty tonight?
She's doing her rounds.
Can you tell her it's Ben Thomas?
It's very important.
-I'II-
- I'II page her.
-Thank you.
Dr. Briar to the nurses' station.
Hey.
-Is it emily?
-No, no.
I'm sorry.
It's--
Is there...?
I'm sorry.
Do you have any more optimism about emily than you did the other day?
Ben when you're looking for a donor with a rare blood type the odds go way down.
To what?
They go down.
What's the--?
Give me a percentage.
Give me a number.
Three, 5 percent.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I wish the numbers were higher.
-Thank you.
Thank you.
-I do.
hello?
Dan.
It's time.
I Iove you.
1:38 a.m.
hello?
Ezra.
My name is Ben Thomas.
I called you a few weeks ago.
You probably don't remember.
I do remember.
I wanna apologize for being so cruel to you but I had to be certain.
I had to be certain that you were a decent man.
Kind.
-Slow to anger.
-What do you want from me?
I wanna give you a gift.
You're gonna be contacted by a man named Dan Morris.
You can trust him.
Was that you at the diner?
Goodbye.
9 1 1 emergency.
I need an ambulance.
I have you at 92 1 2 West Third Street in Los Angeles.
Yes, room number 2.
What's the emergency?
There's been a suicide.
Who's the victim?
I am.
You are gonna need to stop looking at that thing so much.
Why?
Is it gonna crack?
Oh, no.
I paid extra for the non-cracking kind.
I bet you did.
-Why don't you just turn that off?
-I know.
No more.
No more work.
I'm done.
almost done.
almost done.
Tim!
I have procedures.
I understand, but she needs that heart or she will die.
-Ben?
-One, two, three.
Hey.
How you doing?
About a year after the accident, I got sick.
I got lung cancer, and I needed a doubIe-Iobe transplant.
Tim could only give me one, of course.
It must have planted a seed, because he....
About six months later he donated the right part of his liver to this woman.
Her name is holly.
I'm proud of you kids.
Very proud.
Good job.
Good job.
-Ezra.
-Yeah.
Hi.
Are you a parent?
No.
Have we met?
You okay?
You must be emily.
Yes.
It's so nice to meet you.
The End
Okay.
911 emergency.
I need an ambulance.
I have you at 9212 West Third Street in Los Angeles.
Yes, room number 2.
What's the emergency?
There's been a suicide.
Who's the victim?
I am.
In seven days, God created the world.
And in seven seconds I shattered mine.
- I can have four new fillets overnight.
- Oh, no.
No, thank you.
What is your name again?
Ezra?
Is that right?
Yes, sir.
I'll just need your first and last name so I can call up your account.
- You know what?
Here's what I'm thinking, Ezra.
I think I'm gonna mail you the meat back so you can see firsthand the type of dog food that you're peddling.
That won't be necessary, sir.
So how about we just start with your last name?
Thomas.
And don't even get me started on the pork.
- Have you tried the pork?
- Well, no, sir.
I'm not much of a meat eater myself, but I hear really great things about the pork.
- Oh, so you don't eat pork at all?
- No, sir.
Are you Jewish?
Is that why you don't eat pork, Ezra?
Well, can we...?
What's your first name, Mr. Thomas?
Ben.
Hold on, what was that voice?
I don't...
I don't have an order for a Ben Thomas.
Ezra, what was that voice?
- What voice?
- Are you blind?
- Excuse me?
- You're kidding me.
A blind beef salesman who doesn't eat meat.
Now, that...
That is rich.
That is rich.
Have you ever had sex, Ezra?
Did Lawrence in Accounting put you up to this?
Because somehow I can't imagine the blind, vegan beef salesman having sex.
- Listen, I'm trying to help you, sir.
- You're trying to help me?
The blind beef salesman is trying to help me?
I'm actually starting to feel pretty bad for you, Ezra.
Because I look at my life, and it is surrounded by so much beauty and you can't see shit.
Is that fair?
Does that seem fair to you, Ezra?
Do you even know what color the ocean is?
Do you?
- It's blue, sir.
- "It's blue, sir."
Say what you wanna say.
React.
Say what you wanna say to me.
Thank you for calling Cheyenne Meats.
That's not what you wanna say, you coward.
You coward.
You blind, vegan, beef-salesman, virgin coward!
- Goodbye, Mr. Thomas.
- Say what you wanna say.
Ken Anderson.
Nicole Anderson.
Allie Anderson.
Ed Rice.
Steven Phillips.
Monica Freeman.
Sarah Jensen.
Ken Anderson!
Nicole Anderson!
Allie Anderson!
Ed Rice!
Steven Phillips!
Monica Freeman!
And Sarah Jensen!
Hi, can I help you?
Yes.
Hello, I'm looking for Emily.
- You're a friend of hers?
- Yes, ma'am.
- She's not home.
- Oh, goodness.
No, she left this morning.
She had to do some more tests.
She asked me to watch Duke until she got back.
Okay.
You ever try mixing banana peel into the soil?
- Really?
- It works, I swear.
Oh, would you by chance know where I could find her?
Supervisor to 104.
Supervisor to 104.
Cardiac wing?
Take the elevator to the fifth floor then turn left.
Thank you.
Well, that's what I was just saying.
It's absolutely impossible.
Hold the elevator.
Thank you.
Can I help you?
Yes.
Good evening.
I'm here to see Emily Posa.
I'm sorry, visiting hours are from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.
You know, it is really important I speak to her for just a moment.
You'll just have to come back during visiting hours.
Thank you very much.
So if there is one thing that I have learned and you all should remember about winning these contracts:
Three steps.
First, tell them what you're gonna tell them.
Step two, you tell them.
Step three, tell them what you told them.
We are gonna close by reminding them that old girl has a 3-percent better impulse from sea level to vacuum and if they pass on that, quite frankly, they deserve another Sputnik.
Now, if you will excuse me I have a very lovely, very hungry woman at home waiting for me.
Sarah.
Honey.
Everyone at work kept saying it was daylight-savings time.
You were supposed to be here a while ago.
- I kept saying it wasn't.
- This happens all the time.
It's work.
- I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
- No, I'm angry with you.
I'm gonna be angry all night long.
- I'm angry with you.
- What are you doing?
How about that?
How about I'm angry with you?
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.
It's your brother.
Where are you?
I'm at the beach house.
Are you okay?
Of course.
Listen, why'd you disconnect the landline?
The phone broke.
I don't need it anymore.
Did I?
Did I do something?
No.
Not unless you're smoking again.
No, I've put on 20 pounds.
I'm in the best shape of my life.
Are you eating?
Are you taking care of yourself?
- You sound terrible again and...
- Yeah, I'm fine.
Look, I gotta go.
Give Melanie and the kids a hug and a kiss.
I'll talk to you later.
You take care of yourself.
Hold on.
I know it's been a while, but when you were staying here you didn't take something of mine by mistake, did you?
I remember giving you something.
You remember that?
Because I remember that very clearly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Just remember I love you.
Hi, my name is Ben Thomas.
I'm here to see Stewart Goodman.
Inez, look at me, please.
Inez.
I'm speaking to you.
I understand you refused to take your meds again.
Is that true?
No, no, no.
Let's try using your words this time, okay, Inez?
I mean, this silent treatment isn't doing anybody any good.
Inez, how can we help you if...?
Okay, how about I come back tomorrow and see if you've changed your mind, okay?
Thattagirl.
I thought I was coming to your office today.
I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd stop by, save you the drive.
Terrific.
Well, look, let's go talk in my office, yeah?
Come on.
I take a no-nonsense approach.
I mean, I cut the operating costs of this place over 17 percent last year alone.
- I'm sure that made them happy.
- Oh, hell, yeah.
Now, if I could only get my own finances in that kind of shape, I wouldn't have you sitting here.
No offense.
That your new Beemer out front?
Ben, I mean, when I found out that my bone-marrow transplant wasn't successful...
I'm well aware of your ongoing medical condition.
Things aren't looking very promising for me.
Look I have a bonus coming in January.
I just really need this six-month extension.
Really, I mean, I am doing the very best I can here, I promise you.
I'm gonna show myself out.
I'll be in touch.
Well, thank you.
I appreciate it.
I mean, this way everybody wins, right?
Hello.
My name is Ben.
I totally understand if you don't wanna speak to me either.
But I would really like to just have a moment of your time.
I'm trying to figure out what kind of man Stewart Goodman is.
It is within my power to drastically change his circumstances.
But I don't wanna give that man a gift that he doesn't deserve.
I need you to tell me whether or not he is a good person.
"The drug he gives me makes me dizzy.
I want a new one."
Well, that sounds very reasonable, Inez.
What else?
You can trust me.
What else, Inez?
He's punishing you?
How is he punishing you?
How is he punishing you, Inez?
Ben?
- Hey, Ben, where you going?
- Where's the washroom?
To the right.
Is there a problem?
- Give her a bath, right now.
- Absolutely.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You have the wrong impression here.
I'm gonna stop by from time to time make sure you're showing these people some respect.
Look, this is a misunderstanding, okay?
You don't treat people like that.
Let me explain, okay, Ben?
- And I'm not giving you an extension.
- Ben!
I'm not giving you anything.
I almost believed you, you son of a bitch.
I almost believed.
Okay.
Grip and rip.
This time it's gonna be a lot different.
Hey.
- Hey, Michelle.
- Hey.
- Good to see you.
- You too.
- How are you?
- I'm good.
- Hey, man.
- Hey.
What are you doing here?
Just coming to make sure that she is still kicking your ass at everything.
And I am.
- Can we have a sec, hon?
- Yeah.
All right.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm good.
You said you were gonna call me on the 15th.
- Today is the 19th.
- I know.
Doctor didn't have the results, so I had no information to give you.
Still, you should call me.
- Yeah, I know.
Yes, I know.
- We're still friends.
Right?
Yeah.
I'm just...
I'm doing some soul-searching, you know?
Don't do that.
- We have a plan.
- I know.
- Do what you promised me.
- I will.
You know, they rent clubs up at the clubhouse.
I'm well aware of that.
I think I'm gonna keep my ass unkicked today.
Were you looking at him, or were you looking at me?
Actually, I was just sitting here.
Am I doing it wrong?
I think I saw you in the elevator the other day.
Oh, yes.
Actually, you are being audited.
My name is Ben Thomas.
I'm with the IRS, and you owe the government $56, 240.19.
I know.
And now you get me.
Would you have a seat, please, Miss Posa?
So I've been looking over the income statements from the last three years.
- 2005...
- Were...?
Were you in my room the other night?
No, ma'am, I was not in your room the other night.
That's not exactly IRS protocol.
So I've been looking over '05, '06 and '07.
There seems to be quite a disparity between what you claimed and...
Mr. Thomas?
I just got discharged.
So, you know, unless you're gonna, like haul me off to some IRS jail or something I'd really like to get home now.
- Oh, sure.
No problem.
- Okay.
I'll be in touch.
Welcome to the Travel Inn.
Can I help you?
I need a room.
How many hours?
About two weeks.
Clear it!
That's it, that's it!
All right, come on!
Vamos, Manny!
All right, all right.
That's it, that's it.
Hey!
- What you want?
- Break it up!
- You want some of this?
- Get off!
Get off!
Hey, Rico, knock it off!
Somebody wanna remind Rico where we are?
The sanctuary, coach!
- I can't hear you.
- The sanctuary, coach!
That's right, Rico, in the sanctuary.
Now give me 20 starts and stops.
Hello, this is Emily Posa.
I'm not home right now, but please leave a message and I'll call you back as soon as possible.
Thank you.
Hi, my name is Susan Nall.
I'm calling because a friend told me you do letterpress invitations, and I was wondering...
Hello?
Hi, this is Emily.
Yep, I do wedding invitations.
I'm not able to take any requests, though, right now.
I know someone nearby who does it.
She's not as good as I am, but her prices are very...
Hello?
Duke?
Duke.
We're out here.
Hello, Miss Posa.
What are you doing here?
Oh, I came to see you.
Don't you people ever call ahead?
You people tend to try to hide things.
Is that meat?
No!
No, no.
No.
No meat.
No.
- Well, he was really enjoying it.
- He eats steamed broccoli and tofu.
- Why?
- He's a vegetarian.
- He is a vegetarian?
- Yes.
Well, that sucks.
Hey, can we talk?
Do you have a moment?
No.
Actually, I have to take Duke for a walk.
No problem.
I'll go with you, if you don't mind.
- So...
- Hey, hey.
Hey.
So I've been looking over 2005, 2006 and 2007.
Now...
I'm listening.
- Can I get him for you?
- Nope.
I got him.
Let me get him.
Let me get him.
Let me get him.
- You all right?
- Yes.
Whoa, sorry.
Whoa, not these.
- That's okay.
Watch...
- No, no.
Heel, heel, heel.
Yeah, maybe we shouldn't feed him meat.
So I've been looking over...
- Yeah, maybe we can do this later.
- Yeah.
So you cook it all ahead of time, I see.
No, actually.
I can't remember the last time I cooked.
This is my sister's way of looking out for me from afar.
Do you have any siblings?
Yes, one brother.
He's a...
He's a good egg.
Yeah, I just have the one sister too.
Are you receiving income from any source that the government is currently unaware of?
Well, lately I've been taking to diving in local wishing wells, so...
I mean, but it's just occasional dimes here and there or, once in a while, a quarter.
No, actually I had to refinance this place to pay my past-due medical bills.
I've been informed that you suffer from congenital heart failure.
Yes.
Did you gather that while stalking me at the hospital?
No, I...
You're currently Status 2, which means you're sick enough to be on the national UNOS waiting list but not sick enough to be admitted into the hospital and placed on Status 1.
So basically, if your heart starts to fail quickly and no donor can be located you're screwed.
Is it true that you said that you do not believe that you even deserve a heart because your life is unremarkable in every way?
I'm sorry.
I don't know why I said that.
I'm sorry.
Do you have to take any type of sensitivity training to join the IRS, Mr. Thomas?
- No, not really.
- Yeah.
So you don't consider yourself a good person?
How would you answer that question if I asked you the same?
"Unremarkable" would be an upgrade for me I assure you.
I'm gonna freeze your accounts as uncollectible until further notice.
I'm sure that'll buy you five or six months, penalty-free.
Here's my card.
If anyone from the IRS tries to contact you you call me immediately.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay.
- Mr. Thomas?
- Yes.
Why do I get the feeling you're doing me a really big favor right now?
Because I get the feeling that you really deserve it.
All right?
You off to?
You off to pollute someone else's dog now?
No.
Just going home.
Where's that?
Take care, Emily.
You too.
- What is this thing for?
- I told you already.
And why are you bringing a fish into your room?
Because it's my room.
And I don't want anyone going into my room, understood?
Well, I don't think you can keep a fish in your room.
I think I can.
Well, I've never had anybody who kept a fish in their room.
Now you do.
Who?
Good night.
The first time I ever saw a box jellyfish I was 12.
Our father took us to the Monterey Bay Aquarium.
I never forgot when he said that it was the most deadly creature on earth.
To me it was just the most beautiful thing I'd ever seen.
I spoke to the doctor again.
He's gonna send over your files in the morning.
- Is this everything?
- Yeah.
- Any questions?
- Same one.
Well, same answer, then.
You know, I was thinking last night about when we were 14 and we made our big pact.
You remember on the beach in front of your grandparents' house we agreed that we would never, never date each other's girls?
I remembered that that night you told me how much you liked Stacy Miller and that you were gonna ask her out.
And I said:
"Hey, man.
You can't.
Her and I already did it."
Which we didn't, but I wanted to but she liked you way more than she liked me, and...
So I lied to you because I was so jealous.
And I realized that I've been carrying around this lie in my heart for the last 25...
Stop it!
Stop it.
Stay focused.
Do what you promised me.
- What, you think I'm...?
- Do what you promised me.
You think I'm gonna let you down now, don't you?
I've known you my whole damn life!
Okay?
This?
This?
This is not something you do every day.
Okay?
This is...
This is not easy for me.
I'll make sure everything goes as planned.
Don't worry.
Thank you.
Oh, my God.
Hello, Holly.
Look at you.
- What are you doing here?
- I came to see you.
- Really?
- You have a minute?
Sure.
Come on in.
Here's my desk.
Have a seat.
You look great.
- I do?
- Yes.
I feel great.
- How are you?
- I'm really good.
I need a favor.
Whatever you need, just ask me.
I need a name.
Someone in the system.
Someone having a really hard time that needs help, but may be too proud to ask for a handout.
What are you doing?
I'm helping.
I need a name.
Okay.
Connie Tepos.
Her boyfriend almost killed her last year when she tried to leave.
He broke three of her ribs last month.
She's scared to death to press charges and we can't do anything.
- Hello.
- Hi.
- Connie Tepos?
- Yes?
My name is Ben Thomas.
I'm with the IRS.
IRS?
But I always pay my taxes.
Yes, this is more of a general inquiry.
I don't understand.
What...?
May I come in?
Not now.
My boyfriend is not here.
It's very important for your family.
For my family?
Beautiful.
Please, have a seat.
What's this all about?
Your case has come to my attention.
And I wanted to get to know you.
You wanted to get to know me?
Why?
Because I'd like to help you.
I don't understand.
I'm aware of your case.
And your boyfriend.
What are you talking about?
You know what I'm talking about.
No, I have no idea what you're talking about.
Kids, go to your room.
He's coming back?
He's not coming back.
You said you were from the IRS, but you're lying to me.
- No.
- You're not telling me the truth.
Who sent you here?
Please sit down.
I'm not going to sit down.
- Please, calm down.
- I'm not going to calm down.
You come into my house.
You talking to me about mi caso y mi boyfriend?
- Who sent you here?
- Nobody.
Nobody?
Get out of my house immediately.
You can trust me.
I trust no one, Mr. Thomas.
I talked to Holly.
I can get you out of here.
To a safe place.
A beautiful place.
Why did you talk to Holly?
Your children are in danger here.
Don't talk about my kids, Mr. Thomas.
- You don't know.
- You don't have to live like this.
Get out of my house now or I'm gonna call the police.
- Okay, okay.
- Who are you?
- I want you to take my card.
- I don't need help.
I want you to take my card, and call me...
- I don't need it.
- I'm gonna leave it.
Okay.
Thank you.
Get out right now.
- You're not helpless.
- Can you leave?
This is my house.
Please, just think about it.
I don't need you.
- I can't talk right now.
- I need to talk immediately.
- Where are you?
- I'm nowhere.
I'm gonna meet you at the house.
Look, no.
I'm not at the house.
I'm traveling.
I'll talk to you next week.
No, no, no.
We need to discuss this right now.
Wouldn't wanna get on her bad side.
- I'll sign to that.
- Yeah.
How you doing, you two?
I'm good.
Got a big day.
Yep.
No more dialysis, George.
See you in the O.R.
Yep.
- I'll see you there as well.
- Yes, sir.
Thank you.
So I heard you raised enough money to give a couple of the kids partial scholarships to college.
It's no big deal.
I just convinced a couple of bigwig donors that what the world really needs to see is more Latinos on ice.
You know, Ben, I keep asking you this but why me?
Because you are a good man.
No, really.
Even when you don't know that people are watching you.
Hello?
Hello?
Hello?
Okay, I can't hear you, so try back again.
Gonna hang up now.
Bye.
Mr. Thomas?
We're ready for you.
These are beautiful.
Banana peels.
Who knew?
Emily?
Can I get a refill?
- Susan?
- Yeah.
How's Ryan?
He's good.
He's at his dad's this weekend.
Will you tell him for me that I'm ready whenever he is for a free lesson?
Yeah, all right.
Things are kind of crazy right now with school but maybe when school's out.
Oh, yeah.
That's perfect.
How's the pie?
Oh, it's...
It's good.
You gonna ask her out?
The waitress.
No.
You never know.
I don't...
I don't think she sees me.
Good night, Ezra.
Hello?
Ben?
Hi, I'm sorry to call so late.
Did...?
Did someone from the IRS contact you?
No.
I just...
I was having trouble breathing after I took Duke for a walk, and I fainted.
An ambulance had to take me to the hospital.
I'm so sorry.
I don't know why I even called you.
I'm sorry.
It's just that I have your card with me, and...
Ben?
Are you still there?
Yes.
Do you ever think about dying, Ben?
Every now and again.
My face is bluish.
It's not exactly a good sign.
You should try to rest.
Just...
Why don't you see if you can get some sleep?
I like talking to you.
I like talking to you too.
Would you tell me a story, please?
Okay.
All right.
Once upon a time there was a little boy named...
Oh, lucky me, you just got it on reserve like that.
Okay.
Let me guess.
His name was Ben.
No, actually, this little boy's name is Tim.
I like the name Tim.
Go on.
Tim's little brother was always pestering Tim to make him paper airplanes, because he was really good at it.
But Tim had much bigger dreams than that.
Okay.
Then what happened?
One day, Tim went out to the backyard and he put leaves and taped branches to his arms and started climbing the big oak tree.
His little brother said, "Tim, you can't fly."
And he said, "Yeah?
You just watch."
He got all the way to the top and jumped.
How tall was this tree?
It was...
It was pretty tall.
He broke his arm.
Oh, my God...
This is a horrible story.
Oh, no, no.
It gets better.
From that experience, Tim realized that he wanted to fly.
So he dedicated his life to making spaceships.
I thought you said this was a good story.
Oh, well...
Yeah, that is until the dragons showed up.
Oh, okay, see, now it's getting better.
I like dragons.
Especially dragons in space.
Yes, and these were fire-breathing space dragons with really bad attitudes.
I see.
I have an idea.
Why don't you try to fall asleep and when you do, I'll just hang up.
Okay.
Ben?
Yes.
Thank you for listening.
And for talking.
Try to fall asleep.
Good night, Ben.
Good night, Emily.
Emily?
Emily?
I lied to you.
I think about dying every day.
Dr. King to NICU.
Dr. Wesley King, please report to NICU.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
When did you get here?
Last night, after we talked.
You slept here?
Good morning.
How's our patient?
- Morning.
Better.
- Good.
- Hello.
- Hi, Ben.
Is that right?
IRS?
- Yes, how are you?
- Good, thank you.
- I'll leave you two alone.
- No, no, stay, please.
Don't go.
He can...
He can stay.
Whatever you want.
You fainted because your heart was too weak to pump enough blood to your brain.
It's enlarged and it's starting to shut down.
How long?
It's entirely up to your heart.
Could be six weeks, could be a month.
But we've upped you to Status 1 B.
At least I'm on the list.
Not only that, but we're giving you this pager.
And when it goes off, it means you have a donor.
The inotrope drug I started you on it's gonna stabilize your blood pressure within 24 hours.
Then what?
We wait.
- Can I do that at home?
- Once you're stable, you can.
Okay.
I'm gonna run to the cafeteria.
I'm gonna get you something.
If you want something else, I can get you something else.
Would you stay?
I mean, unless you have something else to do.
- I'd really like it if you stayed.
- I don't have anything.
Okay.
Okay.
Hey, hey, hey.
What the hell is that thing?
It's a dog.
Just for one night.
No.
Hold on, hold on.
I don't give two shits, okay?
We have a dog policy here.
Little dogs only.
Poodles and Shih Tzus.
It's in the contract.
It's English and Spanish for everyone to see.
And besides, that, my friend, is not a dog.
It's a goddamn horse.
Well, let me know when you add a horse policy to the contract.
Yes.
Mr. Thomas, it's Connie Tepos.
Hey, Connie.
I don't know why I'm calling you but I'm calling you.
You said you could help us and...
Can you really help us?
This just doesn't make any sense.
- What if he finds us?
- He won't.
- What makes you so sure?
- Stop it.
- You don't know him.
- Stop it.
Don't be weak.
- Don't be weak.
- I'm not weak.
I'm strong.
Take this.
Take it.
You are gonna start this car and you're gonna go.
This is real, and this is gonna be your new life.
- Do you understand?
- Yes.
Look at those babies.
Look at those babies.
Look how beautiful those babies are.
I know, I know.
They deserve it.
Okay?
You're headed north up the coast.
Lorena.
Lorena.
I've always believed this place can heal the soul.
Mommy, the ocean.
Yes, the ocean.
I hope that proves true for you.
When you sign your name on the dotted line of the contract you'll own my house outright.
I only ask that you never mention how you got the house or try to contact me for any reason.
And if you're wondering why you, please stop.
All I ask is for you to honor my wishes and, of course, live life abundantly.
Hey.
Thanks.
Got it.
Hi, Duke.
Hi, baby.
What time does the nurse come?
She should be there by the time I get home.
- Ben?
- Yes.
I know I'm the girl with the broken wing.
But who are you?
Who am I?
I am your friendly neighborhood tax collector.
Ben.
Where the hell did you come from?
I grew up in Oakland.
Literally.
Okay.
Where did you go to college?
As far from Oakland as possible.
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
How about you?
UCLA.
You went to MIT?
Like, the MIT?
Oh, and now you're wondering how I wound up as a lowly tax collector.
Absolutely.
- I sort of stumbled into this job.
- That's a big stumble.
What from?
I always wanted to be an engineer.
An engineer?
What kind?
The kind that sent people to the moon.
Really?
Yes.
I don't wanna talk about me anymore.
That's too bad, because you're very interesting.
Have you...?
Have you ever been in love?
Emily, please.
Yes, you have.
Come on, you can tell me.
Yes.
But it ended.
- What happened?
- Stop it.
- No, seriously, you can tell...
- Stop it.
You need to get some rest.
I'll call you tomorrow, or maybe I'll stop by.
No, if I have questions tomorrow, what then?
That's not a part of the deal.
What the hell does that mean?
Emily, hold on.
Hold on.
- Just leave.
- Emily, wait.
Wait!
Thank you for everything you did.
Did you like the eggs?
They were okay, I guess.
I don't like the eggs you buy.
Okay.
You're wearing suit pants.
To weed.
Yeah, I didn't...
I didn't have any other clothes with me.
- You know, I was gonna get to those.
- I saw them the other day.
I figured I would just take the day off and get this done for you.
Ben?
Yeah?
This is a really ridiculous apology.
Come on.
I wanna show you something.
Oh, no, I gotta finish.
You can finish tomorrow.
Come on.
This is where I used to work.
And these are the artifacts of said work.
Wow, those are great.
How old are they?
This one is just shy of 120 years.
It's how I put out my line of letterpress cards, wedding invitations, invites.
What about this one?
That youngster is the Heidelberg Windmill, 1956.
Call it "The Beast."
Well, that seems appropriate.
It pooped out on me about five years ago, though.
And I can't find anybody to fix it.
It's kind of a dying art.
Defibrillator here works, though.
Luckily.
It kept my business afloat.
Wanna see how?
Please.
Okay.
Now, true pressmen hate that we modern girls want a deep impression.
See, for a hundred years, they tried their damnedest just to kiss it so that it didn't leave an indentation.
Now it's the only way to prove it's not digital.
I think it feels richer.
You okay?
Yeah.
Look, Ben...
I don't really know anything about you or where you came from but you keep showing up.
And I'm glad.
Okay.
Okay.
So Duke needs a walk.
Are you interested?
Yes.
Come on.
Hey, hey.
Right here.
There you go.
He's like a different dog with you around.
I don't think we ever properly bonded.
Why would you get such a big dog?
Did you know that Great Danes on average only live about seven years?
They have heart issues.
I think I got him because I thought he could help me with my illness.
It'd be something I could take care of as opposed to being always taken care of.
You know, just so you know, I used to be really hot.
Like, unauditably hot.
Is that so?
Yeah.
I haven't felt like this in a really long time.
There's so many things that I wanna do.
I wanna go on a plane for 13 hours and not have to stress that I can't reach my doctor.
You know, like, just travel.
Go backpacking, have experiences.
See the world.
I just wanna have the time to figure out who it is that I am.
You know, what I like.
Do things, try things, get out of my head for once.
I would really like to go running.
I think about that sometimes.
What it would just feel like to go running.
So see you tomorrow?
Yes.
But if you need anything, just call and I'll come right back.
Okay.
Bye.
I had a really great time today.
Me too.
Bye.
No anesthetic.
You ever donated bone marrow before?
You're a brave guy.
How long have you known Nicholas?
What the hell happened to you?
Hey, how much longer are you gonna stay in my hotel?
Motel.
How much longer?
Actually, I was planning on dying here.
Well, then you need to pay in advance.
Hello?
Hey, it's Emily.
Are you sleeping?
Yes.
No.
Is everything okay?
Yeah, I'm fine.
My sister came over for a couple of days last week with the kids and it was really great.
I tried calling you a couple times.
How are you doing?
Yeah, I'm good.
Everything's fine.
I've been...
I've been traveling a lot, so...
Well, are you busy tonight?
What do you mean?
I don't...
Maybe you wanna come by and say hello?
Around 7?
You don't have to if you don't want to.
I just, you know...
Look, I totally get if you don't wanna hang out with the dying girl, so...
I can...
I can come at 7.
Okay.
Okay.
Bye.
- Well, how you doing tonight?
- Hey.
- How you doing?
- Have fun.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Come in.
I am so glad she's gone.
Are you okay if we eat outside?
Eating?
You didn't eat already, did you?
- No.
- Okay.
No.
Well, it was a surprise but you're on time.
I haven't cooked anybody food for years, so you better like it.
Or lie to me.
This is for you.
You don't have to say anything.
I just got it...
Change in there.
Dinner is ready and you're not.
So hurry up.
Chop-chop.
You look great.
Yeah.
It's pink.
It's salmon.
You are so nice.
So are you.
Everything's vegetarian.
I hope you like eggplant Parmesan.
I haven't treated myself very well in the past few years.
Start now.
All right.
What do you think?
It's delicious.
Glad you like it.
Do you wanna hear my favorite song?
Yes.
Are you gonna sing it?
No, I can't sing anymore.
Oh, and a performance.
Oh, no.
Shall we?
You need to relax.
This is relaxed.
I have a surprise for you.
Surprise?
Yes.
For me?
- Keep them closed.
- Okay.
And open.
Okay.
You cleaned The Beast.
Actually, I fixed it.
No, you didn't.
Oh, okay, let's go, then.
Wait.
Are you serious?
Try it.
Okay.
Thank you.
Wait right here, okay?
I'll be right back.
Wait right here.
One second.
Hey!
Tell me what's going on.
- Now!
- All right.
Ben, you need to go home.
Do you know they keep a full history of every inquiry a revenue officer makes?
- You understand?
- Keep your voice down.
- Just keep your voice down.
- No.
What you are doing is a crime!
You are impersonating a federal officer.
It's a felony!
All right.
Listen.
You can't play with people's lives.
Do you understand that?
All right.
All right, there's a coffee shop.
There's a coffee shop near where I'm staying.
- Tomorrow we'll sit down...
- Where are you staying, Tim?
Tell me, because I don't know where my brother lives!
A motel.
Five blocks from here.
We'll sit down tomorrow morning, I guarantee it.
Where are my credentials?
Give me my credentials back.
Here it is.
Here.
Here.
Just go home.
You have a beautiful family.
Go home and enjoy them.
Tim, Tim, Tim, why are you even here?
Tell me, who is Emily Posa?
I'll explain everything tomorrow.
Look, give me your car keys.
I'm not going anywhere.
I'm gonna be right here.
So you remember I love you and...
Tim, don't make me come knock on the door, okay?
I didn't realize how late it was and...
I have a really long drive, so I need to go.
I don't wanna keep lying to you.
I don't wanna...
Wait, Emily.
Do you wanna play a game?
What game?
The "what if" game.
The "what if" game.
What if my pager goes off and it's a heart and it works?
And my body doesn't reject it?
And what if I have time?
What if?
What if we have children?
What if we got married?
I love you.
- I love you too.
- I love you.
Hi.
Is Dr. Briar on duty tonight?
She's doing her rounds.
Can you tell her it's Ben Thomas?
It's very important.
- I'll...
I'll page her.
- Thank you.
Dr. Briar to the nurses' station.
Hey.
- Is it Emily?
- No, no.
I'm sorry.
It's...
Is there?
I'm sorry.
Do you have any more optimism about Emily than you did the other day?
Ben when you're looking for a donor with a rare blood type the odds go way down.
To what?
They go down.
What's the...?
Give me a percentage.
Give me a number.
Three, 5 percent.

I'm sorry.
I wish the numbers were higher.
- Thank you.
Thank you.
- I do.
Hello?
Dan.
It's time.
I love you.
1:38 a.m.
Hello?
Ezra.
My name is Ben Thomas.
I called you a few weeks ago.
You probably don't remember.
I do remember.
I wanna apologize for being so cruel to you but I had to be certain.
I had to be certain that you were a decent man.
Kind.
- Slow to anger.
- What do you want from me?
I wanna give you a gift.
You're gonna be contacted by a man named Dan Morris.
You can trust him.
Was that you at the diner?
Goodbye.
911 emergency.
I need an ambulance.
I have you at 9212 West Third Street in Los Angeles.
Yes, room number 2.
What's the emergency?
There's been a suicide.
Who's the victim?
I am.
You are gonna need to stop looking at that thing so much.
Why?
Is it gonna crack?
Oh, no.
I paid extra for the non-cracking kind.
I bet you did.
- Why don't you just turn that off?
- I know.
No more.
No more work.
I'm done.
Almost done.
Almost done.
Tim!
I have procedures.
I understand, but she needs that heart or she will die.
- Ben?
- One, two, three.
Hey.
How you doing?
About a year after the accident, I got sick.
I got lung cancer, and I needed a double-lobe transplant.
Tim could only give me one, of course.
It must have planted a seed, because he...
About six months later he donated the right part of his liver to this woman.
Her name is Holly.
I'm proud of you kids.
Very proud.
Good job.
Good job.
- Ezra.
- Yeah.
Hi.
Are you a parent?
No.
Have we met?
You okay?
You must be Emily.
Yes.
It's so nice to meet you.

So if there is one thing that I have learned and that you all should remember about winning these contracts:
Three steps.
First, tell them what you're gonna tell them.
Step two, you tell them.
Step three, tell them what you told them.
[ALL LAUGH]
So we are gonna close by reminding them that old girl here has a 3 percent better specific impulse from sea level to vacuum, and if they pass on that, quite frankly, they deserve another sputnik.

Now, if you will excuse me, I have a very lovely, very hungry woman at home waiting for me.

I'm speaking to you.
I understand you refused to take your meds again this afternoon.
Is that true?
No, no, no.
Let's try using your words this time, okay, Inez?
I mean, this silent treatment isn't doing anybody any good.
Inez, how can we help you if--?
Okay, how about I come back tomorrow, and see if you've changed your mind?
Okay?
Attagirl.
[SCOFFS]
I thought I was coming to your office today.
Uh, yes, I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd, uh, stop by, save you the drive.
Terrific.
Well, look, let's go talk in my office, yeah?
Come on.
I take a no-nonsense approach.
I mean, I cut the operating costs of this place over 17 percent last year alone.
I'm sure that made them happy.
[CHUCKLES] Oh, hell, yeah.
Now, if I could only get my own personal finances in that kind of shape, I wouldn't have you sitting here.
No offense.

Ben, I mean--
When I found out that my bone-marrow transplant wasn't successful--
I'm well aware of your ongoing medical condition.
Things aren't looking very promising for me.
Look,
I have a bonus coming in January.
I just really need this six-month extension.
[LAUGHS NERVOUSLY] Really, I mean,
I am doing the very best I can here, I promise you.
I'm gonna show myself out.
Uh, I'll be in touch.
Well, thank you.
I appreciate it.

[KNOCK ON DOOR]
Hello.
My name is Ben.
I totally understand if you don't wanna speak to me either.
Um, but I-

A moment of your time.
I'm trying to figure out what kind of man Stewart Goodman is.
It is within my power to drastically change his circumstances.
But I don't wanna give that man a gift that he doesn't deserve.
I need you to tell me whether or not he is a good person.

"The drug he gives me
"makes me dizzy.
I want a new one."

I'm gonna stop by from time to time, make sure you're showing these people some goddamn respect.
Look, this is a misunderstanding, okay?
Don't treat people like that.
Let me explain, okay, Ben?
And I'm not giving you an extension.
Ben!
- I'm not giving you anything.
I almost believed you, you son of a bitch.
I almost believed.

This time it's gonna be a lot different.
Hey.

Uh, yeah, maybe we shouldn't feed him meat.
So I've been looking over--

Uh, maybe we can do this later.
Yeah.
So you cook it all ahead of time, I see.
Uh, no, actually.
I can't remember the last time I cooked.
This is my sister's way of looking out for me from afar.
Mm.
Do you have any siblings?
Yes, uh, one brother.
He's a-- He's a good egg.
Yeah, I just have the one sister too.
Are you receiving income from any source that the government's currently unaware of?
[LIQUID POURS] Well, lately I've been taking to diving in local wishing wells, so...
I mean, but it's just occasional dimes here and there, but, once in a while, a quarter.
No, actually, um...
I had to refinance this place to pay my past-due medical bills.
I've been informed that you suffer from congenital heart failure.
Yes.
Uh, did you gather that while stalking me at the hospital?
Uh, no, I, uh...
[CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY]
You're currently Status Two, uh, which means you're sick enough to be on the national UNOS waiting list, but not sick enough to be admitted into the hospital and placed on Status One.
So basically, if your heart starts to fail quickly and no donor can be located,
you're screwed.
Mm-hm.
Is it true that you said that you do not believe that you even deserve a heart because your life is unremarkable in every way?
I'm sorry.
Um...
I don't know why I said that.
I'm sorry.
Do you have to take any type of, um, sensitivity training to join the IRS, Mr. Thomas?
No, not really.
Yeah.
So you don't consider yourself a good person?
How would you answer that question if I asked you the same?
"Unremarkable" would be an upgrade for me,
I assure you.
I'm gonna freeze your accounts as uncollectible until further notice.
I'm sure that'll buy you five or six months, penalty-free.
Here's my card.
If anyone from the IRS tries to contact you, you call me immediately.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay.
Mr. Thomas?
Yes.
Um...
[SIGHS] ...uh, why do I get the feeling you're doing me a really big favor right now?
Because I get the feeling that you really deserve it.
All right?

Um, you off to, uh--

You remember on the-
- On the beach in front of your grandparents' house, we--
We agreed that we would never, never date each other's girls?
And I remembered that that night you told me how much you liked Stacy Miller, and that you were gonna ask her out.
And I said, "Whoa.
Hey, man.
You can't.
I-
- Her and I already did it."
Which we didn't, but-
- I wanted to, but she liked you way more than she liked me, and so I lied to you because I was so jealous.
And I realized that I've been carrying around this--
This lie in my heart for the last 25--
Stop it.
Stop it.

Good night, Ezra.
[PHONE RINGS]
Hello?
Ben?
Hi, I'm sorry to call so late.
Uh, did--?
Did someone from the IRS contact you?
No.
Um,
I just--
I was having trouble breathing after I took Duke for a walk, and I fainted.
An ambulance had to take me to the hospital.
[SOBBING] I'm so sorry.
I--
I don't know why I even called you.
I'm sorry.
It's just that I have your card with me and...
Ben?
Are you still there?
Yes.
Do you ever think about dying, Ben?
Every now and again.
My face is, um, bluish.
It's not exactly a good sign.
You should try to rest.
Just--
Why don't you see if you can get some sleep?
I like talking to you.
I like talking to you too.
[SNIFFLES]
Would you tell me a story, please?
Okay.
Um...
All right.
Once upon a time, there was, um, a little boy named--
Oh, lucky me, you just got it on reserve like that.
Okay.
Let me guess.
His name was Ben.
[CHUCKLES]
No, actually, this little boy's name is Tim.
I like the name Tim.
Go on.
Tim's little brother was always pestering Tim to make him paper airplanes, uh, because he was really good at it.
But Tim had much bigger dreams than that.
Okay.
Then what happened?
Uh, one day, Tim went out to the backyard and he put leaves and-- And taped branches to his arms and started climbing the big oak tree.
His little brother said, "Tim, you can't fly."
And he said, "Yeah?
You just watch."
He got all the way to the top and jumped.
How tall was this tree?
Um-
- Uh, it was-- It was pretty tall.
He broke his arm.
Oh, my God-- This is a horrible story.
Oh, no, no.
It gets better.
Uh, from that experience,
Tim realized that he wanted to fly.
So he dedicated his life to making spaceships.
I thought you said this was a good story.
Oh, well...
Yeah, that is, until the-
- The dragons showed up.
Oh, okay, see, now it's getting better.
I like dragons.
Especially dragons in space.
Yes, and these-
- These were fire-breathing space dragons with really bad attitudes.
I see.
I have an idea.
Why don't you try to fall asleep, and when you do, I'll just hang up.
Okay.
Ben?
Yes.
Thank you for listening.
And for talking.
Try to fall asleep.
Good night, Ben.
Good night, Emily.

No, no, stay, please.
Don't go.
He can-

Whatever you want.
[SIGHS]
You fainted because your heart was too weak to pump enough blood to your brain.
It's enlarged and it's starting to shut down.
How long?
It's entirely up to your heart.
Could be six weeks, could be a month.
But we've upped you to Status 1B.
At least I'm on the list.
Not only that, but we're giving you this pager.
And when it goes off, it means you have a donor.
[SIGHS] Oh.
The inotrope drug I started you on, it's gonna stabilize your blood pressure within 24 hours.
Then what?
We wait.
Can I do that at home?
- Once you're stable, you can.
Okay.
I'm gonna run to the cafeteria.
I'm gonna get you something.
If you want something else, I can get you something else.

Would you stay?
Um...
I mean, unless you have something else to do.
Uh...
I'd really like it if you stayed.
I don't have anything.
Okay.

Poodles and Shih Tzus.
It's in the contract.

Hey, Connie.
I don't know why I'm calling you, but I'm calling you.
Um, you said you could help us and--
Can you really help us?
This just doesn't make any sense.
What if he finds us?
- He won't.
What makes you feel so sure?
- Stop it.
You don't know him.
- Stop it.
Don't be weak.
Don't be weak.
- I'm not weak.
I'm strong.
Take this.
Take it.
You are gonna start this car and you're gonna go.
This is real and this is gonna be your new life.

Okay.
Um, where did you go to college?
As far from Oakland as possible.
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
How about you?
UCLA.
You went to MIT?
Like, the MIT?
Oh, and, uh, now you're wondering how I wound up as a lowly tax collector.
Absolutely.
Uh...
I sort of stumbled into this job.
That's a big stumble.
What from?
I always wanted to be an engineer.
An engineer?
Wow.
What kind?
The kind that sent people to the moon.
Really?
Yes.
Um, I don't wanna talk about me anymore.
Oh, that's too bad, because you're very interesting.
Have you--?
Have you ever been in love?
Emily, please.
Yes, you have.
Come on, you can tell me.
Uh... yes.
But it ended.
What happened?
- Stop it.
No, seriously, you can tell--
- Stop it.
Uh, you need-- You need to get some rest.
Um, I'll call you tomorrow, or maybe I'll stop by.
No, if I have questions tomorrow, what then?
That's not a part of the deal.
What the hell does that mean?
Emily, hold on.
Hold on.
Just leave.
- Emily, wait.
Wait!
Thank you for everything you did.

Ah, that youngster is the Heidelberg Windmill, 1956.

It pooped out on me about five years ago, though.

Go backpacking, have experiences.

You're trying to help me?
The blind beef salesman is trying to help me?
I'm actually starting to feel pretty bad for you, Ezra.
Because I look at my life and it is surrounded by so much beauty, and you can't see shit.
Is that fair?
Does that seem fair to you, Ezra?

Three steps.

Step two, you tell them.
Step three, tell them what you told them.

So we are gonna close by reminding them that old girl here has a 3 percent better specific impulse from sea level to vacuum, and if they pass on that, quite frankly, they deserve another sputnik.

Well, look, let's go talk in my office, yeah?
Come on.
I take a no-nonsense approach.
I mean, I cut the operating costs of this place over 17 percent last year alone.

Are you receiving income from any source that the government's currently unaware of?
[LIQUID POURS] Well, lately I've been taking to diving in local wishing wells, so...
I mean, but it's just occasional dimes here and there, but, once in a while, a quarter.
No, actually, um...
I had to refinance this place to pay my past-due medical bills.
I've been informed that you suffer from congenital heart failure.
Yes.
Uh, did you gather that while stalking me at the hospital?
Uh, no, I, uh...
[CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY]
You're currently Status Two, uh, which means you're sick enough to be on the national UNOS waiting list, but not sick enough to be admitted into the hospital and placed on Status One.
So basically, if your heart starts to fail quickly and no donor can be located,
you're screwed.
Mm-hm.
Is it true that you said that you do not believe that you even deserve a heart because your life is unremarkable in every way?
I'm sorry.
Um...
I don't know why I said that.
I'm sorry.
Do you have to take any type of, um, sensitivity training to join the IRS, Mr. Thomas?
No, not really.
Yeah.
So you don't consider yourself a good person?
How would you answer that question if I asked you the same?
"Unremarkable" would be an upgrade for me,
I assure you.
I'm gonna freeze your accounts as uncollectible until further notice.
I'm sure that'll buy you five or six months, penalty-free.
Here's my card.
If anyone from the IRS tries to contact you, you call me immediately.
Okay.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Okay.
Mr. Thomas?
Yes.

We agreed that we would never, never date each other's girls?

Hey, man.
You can't.
I-
- Her and I already did it."
Which we didn't, but-

Let me guess.
His name was Ben.

No, actually, this little boy's name is Tim.
I like the name Tim.
Go on.
Tim's little brother was always pestering Tim to make him paper airplanes, uh, because he was really good at it.
But Tim had much bigger dreams than that.
Okay.
Then what happened?
Uh, one day, Tim went out to the backyard and he put leaves and-- And taped branches to his arms and started climbing the big oak tree.
His little brother said, "Tim, you can't fly."
And he said, "Yeah?
You just watch."
He got all the way to the top and jumped.
How tall was this tree?
Um-
- Uh, it was-- It was pretty tall.
He broke his arm.
Oh, my God-- This is a horrible story.
Oh, no, no.
It gets better.
Uh, from that experience,
Tim realized that he wanted to fly.
So he dedicated his life to making spaceships.

Oh, okay, see, now it's getting better.

The inotrope drug I started you on, it's gonna stabilize your blood pressure within 24 hours.
Then what?
We wait.
Can I do that at home?
- Once you're stable, you can.
Okay.
I'm gonna run to the cafeteria.
I'm gonna get you something.
If you want something else, I can get you something else.
[SIGHS]
Would you stay?
Um...
I mean, unless you have something else to do.
Uh...
I'd really like it if you stayed.
I don't have anything.
Okay.
Okay.
[WHIMPERING]
Hey, hey, hey.
What the hell is that thing?
It's a dog.
Just for one night.
Oh, no.
Hold on, hold on.
I don't give two shits, okay?
We have a dog policy here.
Little dogs only.
Poodles and Shih Tzus.
It's in the contract.
It's English and Spanish for everyone to see.
And besides, that, my friend, is-
- Is not a dog.
It's a goddamn horse.
Well, let me know when you add a horse policy to the contract.
[PHONE RINGS]
Yes.
[CRYING] Mr. Thomas, it's Connie Tepos.
Hey, Connie.
I don't know why I'm calling you, but I'm calling you.
Um, you said you could help us and--
Can you really help us?
This just doesn't make any sense.
What if he finds us?
- He won't.
What makes you feel so sure?
- Stop it.
You don't know him.
- Stop it.
Don't be weak.
Don't be weak.
- I'm not weak.
I'm strong.
Take this.
Take it.
You are gonna start this car and you're gonna go.
This is real and this is gonna be your new life.
Do you understand?
- Yes.
Look at those babies.
Look at those babies.
Look how beautiful those babies are.
I know, I know.
They deserve it.
Okay?

Who am I?
Uh, I am your friendly neighborhood tax collector.
Ben.
Where the hell did you come from?
[CHUCKLES]
Uh, I grew up in Oakland.
Literally.
Okay.
Um, where did you go to college?
As far from Oakland as possible.
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
How about you?
UCLA.
You went to MIT?
Like, the MIT?
Oh, and, uh, now you're wondering how I wound up as a lowly tax collector.
Absolutely.
Uh...
I sort of stumbled into this job.
That's a big stumble.
What from?
I always wanted to be an engineer.
An engineer?
Wow.
What kind?
The kind that sent people to the moon.
Really?
Yes.
Um, I don't wanna talk about me anymore.
Oh, that's too bad, because you're very interesting.
Have you--?
Have you ever been in love?
Emily, please.
Yes, you have.
Come on, you can tell me.
Uh... yes.
But it ended.
What happened?
- Stop it.
No, seriously, you can tell--
- Stop it.
Uh, you need-- You need to get some rest.
Um, I'll call you tomorrow, or maybe I'll stop by.
No, if I have questions tomorrow, what then?
That's not a part of the deal.
What the hell does that mean?
Emily, hold on.
Hold on.
Just leave.
- Emily, wait.
Wait!
Thank you for everything you did.

Ben?
Yeah?
This is a really ridiculous apology.
Come on.
I wanna show you something.
Oh, no, I gotta finish.
You can finish tomorrow.
Come on.
This is where I used to work.
And these are the artifacts of said work.
Wow, those are great.
How old are they?
Oh.
This one is just shy of 120 years.
Wow.
It's how I put out my line of letterpress cards, wedding invitations, invites.
What about this one?
Ah, that youngster is the Heidelberg Windmill, 1956.
They call it "The Beast."
Mm.
Well, that seems appropriate.
It pooped out on me about five years ago, though.
And I can't find anybody to fix it.
It's kind of a dying art.
Defibrillator here works, though.
Luckily.
It kept my business afloat.
Wanna see how?
Please.
Okay.
Now, true pressmen, hate that we modern girls want a deep impression.

I don't think we ever properly bonded.
Why would you get such a big dog?
[LAUGHS]
Did you know that Great Danes on average only live about seven years?
They have heart issues.
I think I got him because
I thought he could help me with my illness.
It'd be something I could take care of, as opposed to being always taken care of.
You know, just so you know, I used to be really hot.
Like, unauditably hot.
Is that so?
Yeah.
[BOTH LAUGH]
I haven't felt like this in a really long time.
There's so many things that I wanna do.
I wanna go on a plane for 13 hours and not have to stress that I can't reach my doctor.
You know, like, just travel.
Go backpacking, have experiences.
See the world.
I just wanna have the time to figure out who it is that I am.
You know, what I like.
Do things, try things, get out of my head for once.
I would really like to go running.
I think about that sometimes.
What it would just feel like to go running.

I need an ambulance.
I have you at 9212 West Third Street in Los Angeles.

What's the emergency?
There's been a suicide.
Who's the victim?
I am.
In seven days, God created the world.
And in seven seconds I shattered mine.
- I can have four new fillets overnight.
- Oh, no.
No, thank you.
What is your name again?
Ezra?
Is that right?
Yes, sir.
I'll just need your first and last name so I can call up your account.
- You know what?
Here's what I'm thinking, Ezra.
I think I'm gonna mail you the meat back so you can see firsthand the type of dog food that you're peddling.
That won't be necessary, sir.
So how about we just start with your last name?
Thomas.
And don't even get me started on the pork.
- Have you tried the pork?
- Well, no, sir.
I'm not much of a meat eater myself, but I hear really great things about the pork.
- Oh, so you don't eat pork at all?
- No, sir.
Are you Jewish?
Is that why you don't eat pork, Ezra?
Well, can we...?
What's your first name, Mr. Thomas?
Ben.
Hold on, what was that voice?
I don't...
I don't have an order for a Ben Thomas.
Ezra, what was that voice?
- What voice?
- Are you blind?
- Excuse me?
- You're kidding me.
A blind beef salesman who doesn't eat meat.
Now, that...
That is rich.
That is rich.
Have you ever had sex, Ezra?
Did Lawrence in Accounting put you up to this?
Because somehow I can't imagine the blind, vegan beef salesman having sex.
- Listen, I'm trying to help you, sir.
- You're trying to help me?
The blind beef salesman is trying to help me?
I'm actually starting to feel pretty bad for you, Ezra.
Because I look at my life, and it is surrounded by so much beauty and you can't see shit.
Is that fair?
Does that seem fair to you, Ezra?
Do you even know what color the ocean is?

- It's blue, sir.

We are gonna close by reminding them that old girl has a 3-percent better impulse from sea level to vacuum and if they pass on that, quite frankly, they deserve another Sputnik.

I thought I was coming to your office today.
I was in the neighborhood.
I thought I'd stop by, save you the drive.
Terrific.
Well, look, let's go talk in my office, yeah?
Come on.
I take a no-nonsense approach.
I mean, I cut the operating costs of this place over 17 percent last year alone.
- I'm sure that made them happy.
- Oh, hell, yeah.
Now, if I could only get my own finances in that kind of shape, I wouldn't have you sitting here.
No offense.
That your new Beemer out front?
Ben, I mean, when I found out that my bone-marrow transplant wasn't successful...
I'm well aware of your ongoing medical condition.
Things aren't looking very promising for me.
Look I have a bonus coming in January.
I just really need this six-month extension.
Really, I mean, I am doing the very best I can here, I promise you.
I'm gonna show myself out.
I'll be in touch.
Well, thank you.
I appreciate it.
I mean, this way everybody wins, right?
Hello.
My name is Ben.
I totally understand if you don't wanna speak to me either.
But I would really like to just have a moment of your time.
I'm trying to figure out what kind of man Stewart Goodman is.
It is within my power to drastically change his circumstances.
But I don't wanna give that man a gift that he doesn't deserve.
I need you to tell me whether or not he is a good person.
"The drug he gives me makes me dizzy.
I want a new one."
Well, that sounds very reasonable, Inez.
What else?
You can trust me.
What else, Inez?
He's punishing you?
How is he punishing you?
How is he punishing you, Inez?
Ben?
- Hey, Ben, where you going?
- Where's the washroom?
To the right.
Is there a problem?
- Give her a bath, right now.
- Absolutely.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You have the wrong impression here.
I'm gonna stop by from time to time make sure you're showing these people some respect.
Look, this is a misunderstanding, okay?
You don't treat people like that.
Let me explain, okay, Ben?
- And I'm not giving you an extension.
- Ben!
I'm not giving you anything.
I almost believed you, you son of a bitch.
I almost believed.
Okay.
Grip and rip.
This time it's gonna be a lot different.
Hey.
- Hey, Michelle.
- Hey.
- Good to see you.
- You too.
- How are you?
- I'm good.
- Hey, man.
- Hey.
What are you doing here?
Just coming to make sure that she is still kicking your ass at everything.
And I am.
- Can we have a sec, hon?
- Yeah.
All right.
You okay?
Yeah, I'm good.
You said you were gonna call me on the 15th.
- Today is the 19th.
- I know.
Doctor didn't have the results, so I had no information to give you.
Still, you should call me.
- Yeah, I know.
Yes, I know.
- We're still friends.
Right?
Yeah.
I'm just...
I'm doing some soul-searching, you know?
Don't do that.
- We have a plan.
- I know.
- Do what you promised me.
- I will.
You know, they rent clubs up at the clubhouse.
I'm well aware of that.
I think I'm gonna keep my ass unkicked today.
Were you looking at him, or were you looking at me?
Actually, I was just sitting here.
Am I doing it wrong?
I think I saw you in the elevator the other day.
Oh, yes.
Actually, you are being audited.
