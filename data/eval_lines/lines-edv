How fit?
On a scale from one to ten.
Mark Wahlberg.
How'd it go with Rosa?
Good.
Phase one complete.
Thank you.
Whew.
I was worried she may be in there banging some dude.
Awkward.
It's frozen, and before you ask, yes, I tried restarting it.
Okay, well, please just don't freak out.
No, I'm not.
I'm just getting some light cardio in while it reboots.
If Rosa wants Mark Wahlberg, then Mark Wahlberg she shall have.
Ah!
Hey, there she is, all relaxed and rested from a night of luxury.
Yeah, no, I skipped the spa, and I decided to embrace the tradition, and spend a night in jail, so...
Welcome to the club, huh?
There you go.
Right, guys?
Yeah, how was it?
Pretty intense.
I mean, I got in a fight, and I had to pee in front of a lot of women.
Like, a fight, fight?
Yeah, full on.
Not bad for a priss.
I got to admit it really helped me understand my client better, you know.
And she's a free woman now, so I guess it was worth getting tased.
Ta... tased?
Yeah, not a great feeling.
But I want to hear all about your guys' night, so I'm just gonna freshen up first.
They taught me how to do a whole shower in a sink.
Huh.
It's, like, a one, two...
You know what I mean?
She can never know about this.
Never, ever.
You think they got the tasing on video?
- Larry.
- That's rude.
I bet Morris has it.
Huh.
Wait up, guys.
- Hey, Nina.
- Yeah.
We all pitched in, and got you a little something to welcome you to the PD fraternity.
- What?
- Mm-hmm.
A gift certificate for a one-hour at Miss Hollywood's Thai massage.
Aww.
Is it a brothel?
Only certain rooms.
It's classier than you think.
Well, it's very sweet.
Thank you.
It was pretty cool of you to give up your spa day to hang out in jail, so...
- Hey, Phil.
- Yeah.
Here's that video you wanted.
What was that?
Oh, it's you getting tased.
Bzzz.
Oh.
What, they didn't tell you it was a prank?
Dude.
Morris.
- Oh.
- You ever heard of a secret?
Whatevs.
A prank?
You see, it's something we do...
- A prank?
- Oof!
- Yo.
- Wow.
Huh.
You know what?
It really does work to keep the thumb on the outside.
Did not feel that at all.

I wonder when it was... that I stopped believing I was special.
Although, when I was young, I sure thought I was something special.
Here, Like this...
Like a King and Ace.
That's how I use to think about myself.
Well sure, my school record was bad... and I wasn't popular with girls.
But, on the other hand...
Is that anything special?
Honestly, I just made fun of those other guys.
They had ordinary jobs, and ordinary families, after all.
They were the kind of guys that could only walk that normal kind of life.
But, I don't know anymore.
To tell you the truth, having that kind of ordinary life is incredibly difficult.
It takes an extreme amount of effort and hardship.
In some ordinary way, they manage.
Like this.
I can't say much about that.
I suppose...
I'm more like this.
And you?
Well...
Like this?
Well, that's good enough.
Did you see my cards?
My cards are...
No, that's not it.
What we have in store for you today is...
We've invited an incredible person for you today.
What?
!
Who?
Who?
It's the Femme-Magician, Ms. Sawada!
Hello!
It's nice to meet you!
How creepy!
Well, well...
Look here!
Attention!
Now, now...
We're already paying attention.
First, check these spoons.
- Is there something to them?
- What about them?
Okay then!
Here...
Attention!
- Bend!
- Huh?
- Bend you bastard!
- What?
Look, here, here here!
It's bending.
It's bending!
There, there, there!
Oh, no!
It's gone limp!

Here goes!
ぐるぐるぐる！
ぐるぐるぐる！
ぐるぐるぐる！
バア！
No stealing!
We we're not going to!
You sure have become famous Sawada.
Your gay character is so good.
No, this is just the beginning.
Ah, this is producer Saito, who is in charge of the program.
Ah, It's a real pleasure!
Well, I am...
I am, voila!
, Bar Manager Nobukichi.
Well, isn't that something...
Unfortunately, I can only do it normally.
Mr. Sawada has always been good to us.
My name is Saito.
Thank you.
- Hello.
- Hey.
Haruo, it's been a while.
Ah, Sawada...
Yeah.
You came.
I didn't even realize.
How are you?
I'm fine... yeah.
And how are you lately?
What do you mean "how"?
He's really famous now.
He's even on TV.
Wow...
Is that so?
I don't really watch TV at all.
Wouldn't it be nice if Haruo was on TV too?
Oh!
Without a doubt!
What kind of material do you do?
Huh?
Well, not relly...
Hey, show him.
Well, then...
Give me a second...
Then, with this...
Okay...
The usual!
No way...
Are you an amateur now?
What's that?
Who's the senior here?
I can't tell since you are both so casual to eachother.
Have I been here a bit longer?
No, you've been here a lot longer.
Hasn't it already been about 20 years?
- Yeah, that's right...
- I'm still only on my 8th year.
Ah, that's right.
Sure, that's about right.
Yeah, but he's not normally a good talker.
Well, I would be happy too if I could chat as easily as that.
Yeah.
Honestly, you just get nervous, right?
"Asshole!"
or doing something like that to your face seems a bit odd.
フン
Grapefruit Sour please.
Squeezed.
Yes, right away.
What was that?
Sawada finally introduced you to someone from broadcasting.
Couldn't you have been a bit more thoughtful with your words?
You've said so yourself.
That "magic is only one part hand, but three parts mouth."
It's not just the ones in Asakusa, but all Magicians.
You can't live as a Magician, If you can't make them smile by talking.
This reeks.
What did that guy eat?
Probably something really nice, with that TV show money.
Okay... here!
（林のため息）
I sure would like to make it...
What brought that on?
Nothing...
Lately my Mom has been nagging.
"Hurry up and do it right."
That's how it is, huh?
How about you?
Your mom doesn't say anything?
I've never had a mom to begin with.
Ah, is that right?
Well, why not?
What?
I heard my old man got another woman, and left her after I was born.
Really?
Nice guy, huh?
Yeah, pretty great.
And, the old man's job was cleaning a love hotel.
Impressive.
And now?
I don't know.
I haven't seen him since I graduated high school.
（林）ふ-ん I see.
Shotaro Todoroki, you say?
- Is this the right spelling?
- Yeah.
When was the last that you talked to Mr. Todoroki?
He's spread out, battered and smells.
Looks like it was sudden.
Yes, that's how it seems.
Yeah.
Mr. Yabe.
Yes?
The ID checks out.
I see.
Good.
Then there won't be too many coming to see him.
All right, proceed for now.
- Okay.
- Write the necessary documents, and meet me after you're done.
Understood.
It's a bargain.
How about it?
It's a real bargain.
Please have a look.
It's a bargain.
How about it?
Help yourself.
Ah, that's half off right now.
- Ah, really?
- How about it?
Either one seems fine...
I'll go with this.
It's a bargain.
Help yourself.
（水がしたたる音）
What are you doing about this?
I've called the repairman.
Give me a break already!
Mr. Todoroki.
It's awful.
It looks like a water pipe has broken somewhere upstairs.
I'm so sorry.
This place is already so old... （溜息）
（携帯電話）
Yes?
Is this Haruo Todoroki?
Yes.
I'm from the Arakawa East Police Station.
You would be Shotaro Todoroki's son?
Yes
I regret to inform you, but...
Shotaro Todoroki has passed away.
Your father has passed away.
Ah... yes.
Well then, if you would please sign here.
And I'll return your identification card.
Then, wait here just a moment, please.
Okay.
He was found on the underside of the railroad overpass.
The autopsy result was that of a stroke, so we are dropping the investigation.
I'm glad that we managed to contact his family.
It was thanks to where we found his body.
Why would you treasure such a thing?
Father.
It's tough being alive, isn't it?
Every day is miserable.
I...
I don't even know why I'm still alive anymore.
I even don't know what I should do.
Why am I...
Why am I alive?
A Bolt From the Blue
To receive an unexpected shock, or a sudden unpredicted event, likened to the echo of a lightning bolt from a clear blue sky.
Idiom derived from Chinese literature.
Hey, let's go already.
I said, it's fine.
Is he dead?
Don't be so scared.
He's alive!
Run!

Transportation War Eradication Campaign
Excuse me... ちょっ・・・
What's the matter?
Well...
It looks like I'm a little lost.
Do you need directions?
Directions...
I don't know how to get back.
Where do you want to return to?
Where..?
That's....
I don't really have anywhere to return to...
Huh?
Nevermind...
Rather, I don't want to go back.
What's this?
Huh?
Oh, sorry.
How much did you say?
30 Yen.
ああ
Then, here.
You're a magician?
Huh?
You're a magician?
Yeah, you might say.
Wow.
Where do you appear?
Appear?
Do you know a place that does magic?
Yup!
Want to go?
Here, hurry!
Here!
Asakusa Thunder Gate Hall
- It's a color TV.
- That's right, a color TV.
It suddenly turns black and white into color.
Wow, it was a total shock.
After all, it's like, "woah, did you know pandas were that color?"
Enough about black and white, it's color that we've waited for.
Yeah, but pandas are so cute.
- They sure are.
- Mr. Peckers.
You can't call it that!
Today, there is a line in Ueno Zoo to see Mr. Peckers.
What an awful punch line.
No one is laughing.
So then, who's place have you come from?
Who's?
You're teacher.
あ・・・
No one.
Leave.
This isn't a place for an amateur to just come in and stand on stage.
Huh?
Shouldn't you at least give him a chance manager?
Please.
Okay.
Then...
There.
Anything else?
To appear on the stage with just that would be a problem.
Something else?
Well...
Let me borrow this.
That kind of thing.
Try it again.
It's the first time I've seen that.
Do you know Uri Geller?
Not Yuri Toru?
No...
Nevermind.
Did you learn this from someone?
No one.
I thought of it myself.
That's amazing!
All right!
I'll look after you.
Really?
Uhm...
Actually, I don't have any money, and I don't have anywhere to stay.
Then you can live here like the other guys in the troupe.
Just use whatever you like.
- Thank you.
- You...
How is your dialogue?
Huh?
On an Asakusa stage, among the magicians and acrobats, only the ones that can make them laugh should eat.
Talking isn't my strength.
You leave me no choice then.
Then, I'll write you a script.
Come to think of it...
We'll go with Pepe for your name.
Pepe?
Good morning.
Hey!
Hey!
Oh, Etsuko.
How did it go?
I couldn't reach him after all.
I see...
Then how about being this guy's assistant?
Huh?
He's going to be on our stage from here on out as Pepe the magician.
I thought I would sell him as a mysterious Indian.
Indian?
Your face looks Indian after all.
へへっ
Etsuko was Chin's assistant, who left us.
Chin disappeared on us.
That sure works out, doesn't it?
Then, get to it.
It's a pleasure.
Same here.
Isn't that great?
Yeah.
I want to be on stage soon too!
You want to be a magician?
Yeah, I have a real great gag too!
Watch, watch!
ぐるぐるぐる！
ぐるぐるぐる！
That's great!
バア！
You're...
No stealing!
Bye.
Bye.
- Yo!
- Yo!
Pepe, Magician
Hello, and thanks for coming.
Today, if we exclude the empty seats, we have a full house.
Well then, to replace Mr. Chin from now on, we have a magician who crossed the ocean from India.
Please cheer.
It's Mr. Pepe.
Namaste!
I'm Pepe, from India.
What do you think?
It's good, isn't it?
Well...
Today, I'll show you a miracle from India.
The object please.
Yes.
Okay, watch the spoon carefully.
There is no trick or gadget.
It's a normal spoon.
Here goes.
アイ！
Amazing!
The spoon broke!
Now that's how it should be.
The Whaling Ship
Here, thank you for waiting.
- It's fine!
- Don't take a picture.
- It's fine!
- Why?
Don't take it!
- Relax.
- Take mine.
I'm not taking yours.
Here.
Oh, thanks.
It's the first time I've seen the customers get so excited.
Oh, sorry for not doing that myself.
Oops.
Here, have some too.
Okay.
In the future Pepe will be the man that carries Asakusa on his shoulders.
Though, you're still lacking the laughter part.
あ・・・ ハハ・・・
Hey, eat before it gets cold.
Eat Gei and become great yourself.
Gei?
It's written as "whale," but it's read as Gei.
This is whale?
Drop it!
Drop it!
Ah, the championship is going to be tough this year.
You idiot.
- Don't take baseball players lightly.
- Ouch!
- Here, water.
- I have this, it's fine.
It sure would be nice to have more spoon bending.
Oh, there will be.
A guy called Uri Geller will come, and there will be a spoon bending boom!
Yuri...?
Uri Geller!
Uri Geller!
How would anyone know whether or not a boom was coming?
That's because I can see the future!
What?
That's it!
Don't give up!
Aim for V9!
V9 They can do it. 9 consecutive series.
I've heard about this.
Amazing!
Excuse me, Japanese Sake please.
Pepe?
- Oh...
- Are you okay?
I'm sorry.
I guess I had too much fun.
It's only natural that you had fun after all that excitement.
I've finally become that Ace and King.
Ace and King?
Ah, nevermind.
So, what now?
Huh?
Well, I could go home, or there's that other thing...
Is your place close?
Ah... yeah, sort of.
Ah...
I see...
Should we, I wonder...
What?
Well, that was meant to be a joke.
Ah...
So what now?
Should I go...
Is your close place, close?
- Look.
- Yes?
Can you really see it?
- What?
You said before that you could see the future.
About that "Uri Geller."
No.
- It was a joke.
- Oh.
No one can see the future.
- You're right.
- Yeah.
So...
Is your place close?
Good morning.
Hi.
Hey Pepe.
Oh, good morning.
You're on stage by yourself today?
What?
Nevermind.
It's impossible, I know.
What about Etsuko?
She called in earlier and said she wasn't feeling well.
- Is that so?
- Yeah.
Then I should probably go check on her.
No, she said it wasn't such a big deal, so you don't have to.
I see.
Then, I'll be back in a bit.
Etsuko?
Oh, Pepe.
I'm sorry.
Don't be.
Do you want a banana?
No.
I need to go.
Where?
To the police.
Huh?
Sho..
I mean Chin has been arrested.
Oh
Chin?
Your old partner?
Yes.
He left 2 weeks ago.
Just when I thought something happened to him, I got a call from the police...
The police?
What happened?
Anyway, I have to go.
That's impossible.
But...
Then...
I'll go.
He's representing Etsuko Hanamura.
Okay.
Then, let's continue.
Hey, he's here.
What do you mean Etsuko's "representative"?
Etsuko is not feeling well.
And you are?
I'm a magician from Thunder Gate Hall.
Oh, a magician?
Come here a second.
I showed a customer how to turn a ¥1000 bill into a ¥500 bill with magic.
And then they called it defamation, and fraud, and stuff.
So, this is about exchanging a customer's ¥1000 bill for a ¥500 bill?
Yeah, that's right.
It was magic.
They really don't get the joke.
I got the criminal treatment.
You're one fine criminal.
It's not my fault the Police were deceived.
Don't get defiant attitude.
There's no way the police would accept it as a joke and walk away.
What?
Why do I have to listen to this from some punk I just met?
So you don't die like a loser!
I'm not dead!
Yes, you are!
Then what am I right now?
!
Do you have a minute?
Etsuko?
Hey.
Hey, I heard you're sick.
It's fine.
Lay down.
I give up.
Basically, the police were deceived.
There was no avoiding...
What's with you?
We have a guest...
Well, you seem to be feeling better...
I get it!
I get it!
I'm sorry!
I thought about a lot when I was alone.
I was so surprised when you told me you were pregnant all the sudden.
Are you okay?
Lie down.
Should we go to the hospital?
I'm fine since I'm sitting.
I see.
Want a banana?
No thanks.
Hey, look.
I can do it now.
May 10th?
Huh?
That's my birthday.
So?
Do you want a present?
Half a year later, on May 10th...
I'm... born from her.
What happened?
I almost pissed myself, I fumed.
I lack gas, money and a woman.
- What happened?
I almost pissed myself...
- What do you mean?
I'm having the 2 of you work together.
Honestly, you're no good by yourselves.
But manager...
From my point of view, you can't just be getting free meals.
But with this guy?
Pepe is right about that.
Chin should use Etsuko's dialogue.
Wait a minute.
Wouldn't that make me his assistant?
I suppose it would.
Why me?
Welcome.
Pepe and Chin, Magicians
Okay, let me introduce you to my new assistant.
From all the way from China, Mr. Chin!
I'm Mr. Chin!
I'm finally back in Asakusa!
Did you miss me?
Someone say something you fools!
Hey, Chin is just doing what he wants.
It looks like it.
Okay, today we'll show you a miracle from India.
Assistant...
Mr. Chin!
Huh?
The object...
Shouldn't you get it yourself?
It's right there!
Handing things over is the assistant's job.
Oops...
It slipped!
It's because my hands are so slippery.
It slipped right out!
How careless...
- What are you doing?
- Huh?
- What are you doing?
- What?
- What are you thinking?
- Huh?
Why won't you hand it over?
- What?
I can't hear you!
- Why won't you hand it over?
I don't understand what you're saying.
- You haven't changed at all since then.
- Huh, since when?
You haven't changed at a bit!
What was that?
You saw that?
What was that?
Why would you do such a thing?
Don't you push me that hard.
Don't you push me that hard!
Don't screw with me!
What?
You did it first!
Don't you screw with me!
- What's with you?
!
- You started it!
- Chin, Chin!
- Pepe!
Oh, boy.
Hmm, I see...
- A fighting performance?
- No, I mean, doing magic while quarreling.
How about "Fight Magic?"
That's the first I've heard of it...
- You two were certainly a good laugh today.
- Then why?
Not to be laughed at, but to make them laugh...
with your quarreling!
I'm not so sure about that...
Hey, that's a good idea!
I've never seen someone do magic while fighting before.
- Yeah.
Really!
- Do you get it?
Do it!
Give it a try!
No, do it for real!
Really fight!
Right?
It'll be a hit!
Hey!
Just wait a minute!
Walk straight already!
Ouch...
- Hey!
- What?
Get a grip, man!
Don't get irritable, you!
Walk straight!
Thank you.
It's nothing.
Was Sho much trouble?
He's always been causing trouble...
I suppose so.
I'm sorry.
I'll give it to him, first thing in the morning.
But, in his own way, he's been doing his best for our child.
So, please look after him.
You sure have a way with words.
Huh?
It's true that he's a worthless guy...
At least, I...
It would have been nice if the child followed in his footsteps.
Thanks for the water.
Huh?
Oh...
Look here!
There's nothing inside, right?
There's nothing at all!
But if I say "hocus-pocus" to it, what do you think will come out?
What could it be?
A dove would be pretty expected, wouldn't it?
So, it couldn't be a dove...
So, everyone understands that it has to be something else, right?
I have no idea.
What will come out?
I really don't know!
Right, a dove...
A dove?
It's hard to make things appear!
You make me look like an idiot when you say "it can't be a dove," and then a dove comes out!
From the get-go, everyone way saying "dove, dove," and then it was a dove!
How could anyone be surprised?
!
The 9th consecutive championships are at hand.
Pitcher Horiuchi has given up the 6th ball.
It's hit!
It's really high in left field!
Center fielder Shibada, is putting it on the line, and is prepared!
Tanaka is caught!
And the match is over!
The Giants have 9 consecutive victories!
Welcome.
Okay, are you ready?
I'm tying it right around my neck...
Okay, here goes!
* "Pepe Chin" are now higher on the talent list. * 1, 2, 3!
There!
And it's completely untied, just like that.
Woah!
- Amazing!
- How about it?
I can do it just by pulling it tight?
Anyone can!
It just comes loose.
1, 2, 3!
There!
Stronger!
Pull it tight!
That's strange...
Pull it firmly.
Let go!
It won't come loose?
No, it won't at all!
You're just too weak!
For repaying our debts...
It's cold.
One Taiyaki, please.
That's 50 Yen.
Make that 2.
Then it's 100 Yen.
With the rope gag, I'd like it to be more interactive.
Oh.
Then how about letting a guest pull on it?
I see.
Then I'll do it one time first, and then you'll give it a try...
"but I'm too afraid!"
Then, "would a guest like to try?"
- "A guest?" - "That's right."
- "That's not scary, right?" - "No, it's not."
- Would a guest like to... * "Pepe Chin" are even higher on the list of talent.*
Isn't it pretty?
I just don't like it.
You guys should give it more effort.
I can't bear it.
Instead this 2 person comedy, they should smile at the magic.
But, it's pretty impressive.
Even we have to learn from this.
Don't talk so big!
Ouch!
I've yet to see you make someone smile, not once!
It's only been half a year, and there's no one in Asakusa that doesn't know Pepe and Chin.
- That's amazing.
- What's with that hair?
- I'm your guru.
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.
- Oh, I see.
But, we sure are planted firmly here...
Also with a baby on the way.
Right?
- Right.
Shall we have a fight of it?
Huh?
We shouldn't be satisfied with the several hundred customers in Asakusa.
Millons more...
With several million customers, that would be hundreds of millions in income.
Shall we give it a shot?
What's with you?
On TV!
- Woah!
- TV?
- Woah!
- That's great!
That's a great idea!
Whatever, just fly on away from Thunder Gate Hall.
I won't even mention your contract...
Hey, manager!
You just did!
Okay then, I'll take responsibility and do the management of it all.
In return, 20% of the return for me, and 20% for you.
Hey, you just said you wouldn't talk about contracts!
You bastard!
I'm the manager, damn it!
- Manager?
- Yeah!
This guy's our manager?
Don't you look down on me!
You look too strange for that.
What's that?
What on earth are you wearing?
What's wrong with it?
Good afternoon.
Ah, Etsuko, you sure have gotten big.
I've been doing nothing but eating.
Look!
I bent it!
Oh no, a spoon isn't something to play with.
It's great!
I'll be like Uri Geller!
Sure you will...
Look for a second.
It's bent.
I saw it already.
Stop saying such nonsense, and give me a hand.
Did you do your homework?
I did half of it.
Why just half?
You have to do it all.
- He said it's okay to just do half.
- Theres no teacher that would say that.
Shine!
Battle of the Stars
- Now, introduce yourself.
Shine!
Battle of the Stars
- I'm Johnny.
- It's a pleasure.
- It sure is.
I'm so happy!
There are so many people here.
Johnny, look around.
There are so many pretty ladies.
Pepe and Chin, stand by please.
Yes.
Let's go.
Hi there!
Hi!
How is everyone?
!
One more time!
Okay, stop already!
What are you doing?
That hurts!
My partner will die like that!
Obviously it's all tight!
You have to put some muscle into it.
- Do it quickly.
- It's fine then?
Sorry, just one more time.
I'm sorry everyone, just give us one more chance please.
Pull!
Pull!
Pull over there!
Like this...
We were right to change the rope gage after all.
Yeah.
The judges were laughing and clapping.
Chin!
Etsuko collapsed and she's been taken to the hospital!
What?
Placental Separation?
Yes, ordinarily a placenta is like this, and after child birth the uterus is like this...
It's separated, but in your wife's case...
The placenta is already in that separated state.
I don't really understand.
Well, I'd like to have her admitted for the time being.
Then she'll be fine eventually, right?
Ah...
Is that what she told you?
Is she wrong?
Well, I haven't quite told her yet...
It's nice that it wasn't anything serious, and the baby is all right.
- I'm sorry for worrying you.
- Don't be.
Have a healthy baby.
I will.
Thanks.
Thanks for waiting.
What's the deal?
Hospital rooms sure are dreary.
What did the doctor say?
Hmm?
It looks like you'll be hospitalized until the delivery.
Until then?
Yeah, that's what he said.
Hospital food sure is bad.
Here.
I wanted to buy you the real thing, but I haven't gotten this month's salary yet.
Heh, all right already.
Sorry about that.
It's okay.
Thank you.
Man, I'm hungry.
Manager, treat us to something.
- OK, let's go.
- What are we going to eat?
Oh, you're going too?
Was that all?
Huh?
The doctor didn't say anything else?
No, not really.
Then, rice curry!
Let's go then!
- Okay, let's go.
- Sho.
I'm sorry, but I have to talk to Sho.
Ah, okay.
Come on let's go!
OK.
Bye!
Bye.
What will we name the kid...
I have a few ideas...
Sho.
Yeah?
Don't you have somthing to tell me?
No, not really.
Sit.
Why?
Sit.
Okay, I'm sitting.
Look at me.
What's with you?
Over here.
Okay, I'm looking.
You're hiding something...
Aren't you?
No.
I said no.
Sho.
I said there was nothing...
Tell me the truth.
Now, on my signal, pull!
Here goes!
1, 2,3!
Pull!
Harder!
Pull harder!
It's not coming off!
Pull more!
More!
More!
Wait...
Chin, are you okay?
Eveyone's worried...
And there he goes...
So, welcome my new assistant, Ms. Chan!
Hey!
What was that?
What were you doing?
Did you think that would be fun?
That wouldn't make them laugh.
Are you even trying?
No.
What?
What do you mean, "no?" What are you saying?
I told you, I don't feel like it!
I'm quitting the duo.
- What?
- I have a kid on the way, so I don't have time to be dreaming.
I'm going to get a more dependable job.
Don't blame your kid for being wishy-washy.
Shut up!
Who are you telling to "shut up?"
Etsuko might die!
What?
He said it's not a normal pregnancy.
And, she could die after giving birth.
But I can't...
I can't very well ask her to have it.
What?
What are you saying?
!
That's not what I've heard.
What do you mean?
You abandoned mom, didn't you?
What?
What's going on?
That's no good.
That's no good at all!
I had a worthless father!
And my mother deserted me!
That's why my life has been miserable!
Right?
I can't believe it...
She risked her own life so that she could give birth...
It doesn't make any sense!
I told you, I don't know what you're talking about.
Give it up.
What?
He'll just be a worthless child anyway.
It's not fair that she would die for that kid.
So, give it up.
Okay?
Have an abortion.
Please.
No one will blame you.
Okay?
Just give it up already.
Just let it go...
What's with you?
Ow...
It hurts...
A canary song
Sleep.
Sleep.
Go to sleep.
Above the cradle
The evergreen fruits sway
Sleep.
Sleep
I wish for a healthy baby.
- Etsuko
Our stupid owner.
All he does is play pachinko and sleep in the women's dorm, where he's not welcome.
Ouch...
Oh, I'll manage it.
Okay, then I'll leave it to you.
Thanks.
Sure.
I went for a massage, but it didn't do a bit of good.
Oh...
How did you?
Did something happen?
Nothing.
So then, there's another face card in the deck?
There wouldn't be one.
Since that card is one of a kind...
No other exists like it.
Thank you.
I see you still kept it.
What?
Oh, that?
Yeah.
I've come to like it.
Why's that?
It's plain and simple, but it does it's best to pretend.
It seems like you're talking about yourself.
Sho said the same thing yesterday.
Really?
But it's pretty.
It may be made out of paper, but in it's own special way, it's blooming to the best of it's ability.
It's really pretty.
Can you see?
Huh?
The future...
My future?
My child's future?
No...
No one can see the future.
But, the Giants and Uri Geller...
Well...
So you can't?
Well...
Then just a little bit...
Okay.
Really, I'll just do a bit.
Ust a bit.
Let's see...
Well...
He won't be too great in school.
Then sports?
Not really...
He won't be popular like that.
He probably gets that from his father.
I guess so.
Despite that...
In fourth grade, he will do magic in front of everyone.
Magic?
Yes.
Although, it's just simple coin magic that Chin taught him.
And then...
All at once, everyone in the class will gather around.
That's amazing!
And on Valentines that year he will receive his first chocolate from a girl.
He'll store it safely in the refrigerator... and Chin will eat it all on his own.
That sounds like him.
Well, he's always been like that.
He never really felt like a father, I suppose.
What about me?
What kind of a mother would I be, from the child's perspective?
For the child...
You're...
His reason for living.
No matter what he does it doesn't turn out very well.
And...
Sometimes he thinks that he should just give up already.
But...
He knows...
The extent...
That his mother...
That she has such great expectations of him.
And...
Later...
She taught him...
That...
How precious life is.
So...
Etsuko is...
His reason for living.
He's glad...
He's glad to be born from that kind of a mother.
That's what I think.
I'm glad.
Thank you.
I love you.
Oh...
It kicked.
Did you hear me?
He did.
Want to feel?
No, it's okay...
Here!
He really is.
Oh, look.
It's cleared up.
Hey.
Hey.
I suppose tomorrow's the last audition.
Yeah.
I have a lot to work on.
What?
You're doing it by yourself?
Well, I can't succeed if I don't try.
Boy, I really wanted to see you fail, but I don't have the time.
About your job...
Why a love hotel?
Surely there are other places.
Huh?
Well, they are flexible with me there.
Just in case...
It's possible that I'll end up by myself, with a kid to take care of.
Well, I can't succeed if I don't try.
What if...
What if that's what happens?
What will you tell the kid about Etsuko?
Let's see...
It wouldn't be right to tell the kid, "she died giving birth to you," I suppose.
Maybe along the lines of "I found another woman?"
Do something more believable!
That's laughable!
He'll get use to it.
Look here...
Then, this should be inside the deck.
And then, the top most card is...
Huh?
Hold on a second...
It looks like he's not ready for the stage just yet.
Let me see...
Etsuko?
Ah!
Is it time?
Hey!
Hey!
Someone!
The baby is coming!
Doctor!
Excuse me.
We're moving you.
Come this way.
Okay, face me please.
How do you feel?
Are you nauseous?
I'm going to feel your stomach.
- Nurse
- Yes?
It must hurt.
It will be all right.
Breathe slowly.
One big breath!
- And breathe.
- You're doing fine.
Slowly, slowly.
Just a bit longer.
Prepare the Methergine.
- Sho.
- Yeah.
It's okay.
He seems like a great doctor.
Just calm down...
I've slapped you a lot, haven't I?
I'm counting on it.
Have you thought of a name?
Hmm?
It's Haruko.
Why's that?
Because it has cleared up outside.
And if it's a boy?
Then...
It would be Haruo.
Sho.
Don't...
Don't eat all the chocolate yourself.
Okay.
Okay, sure.
We're moving her now.
Let's go.
Etsuko!
Hang in there!
Next is entry number 8.
Haruo Todoroki.
Push...
Now relax.
Hang in there!
Breathe slowly...
Don't stop breathing.
Okay, breathe...
You're almost there.
Now relax.
Relax...
Push!
Okay, now push!
Hang in there Ms. Hanamura.
Yes?
I'm the person before, from the Arakawa East Police Station.
From before?
The one that delivered the remains.
Oh...
I'm terribly sorry, but we would like you to return the urn.
Huh?
Actually, it turns out that the remains were of someone else.
What?
That strange homeless man lied to us.
He was saying something we couldn't understand, something about wanting to find his son.
We'll give you a full report when you get here.
Yeah.
Okay.
Yo!
Ha!
It's you.
After looking for a while, you started looking familiar.
What do you mean by that?
It wouldn't be strange if I kicked the bucket too without anyone noticing.
Before that happened I wanted to talk to you about your mom.
That's not the normal way of going about it.
I can't help it if the police were deceived.
Now I wish I never said anything...
Ahh..
I give up.
Huh?
What's that?
Look...
What?
Actually, a while ago...
In other words...
I probably should have said it earlier...
Thanks.

閉じ込められてた 気持ちが
今静かに 放たれていく
重たく冷たい 扉を開けて
微かな光を感じる
あきらめかけた いくつかの
夢 希望 憧れ 幸せ
朝顔が空に 伸びるみたいに
その光を たぐり寄せる
右へ左へ 迷いながら
その度に蔓を巻き
陽のあたる場所に登りたい
あなたも そこに来て
もう一度 その温もりに
その優しさに 包まれて生きたい
払い落としても 消えない愛が
ひとるあるの
それで強くいられる
あるときは もっと滅茶苦茶に
自分を傷つけたい衝動に
かられてしまう 誰のせいにも
出来ない不運を目の前に
だけどたった今 分かったのは
誰もが 「生きる奇跡」
生まれてきた ただそれだけで
愛されてる証
もう二度と その温もりに
その優しさに 触れないとしても
いつまでも 消えない愛が
ひとつあるの
それで強くなれる
だからもう 恐れることは
何もないの
心は空に
いまそっと放たれる
Force, was the very foundation of what I call Iranian nationalism,
Iranian national ethos.
Wrestling was a national obsession.
'Cause physical training was viewed as the foundation of healthy citizenship, healthy state.
Before you got in to the wrestling, you were the bodyguard of Shah of Iran.
Now Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran, weds Farah Diba
The Shah came to power in 1941, after his father was forced out of power,
During the 1940s, early 50s, ah, he was in a very peculiar position because of the conflict, international conflict over oil.
He was under a lot of pressure and he was identified with... as an enlightened monarch, often repressive.
In the 1950s and 60s, there were two fundamental role models.
One, in Iran, for the Iranians, was Gholamreza Takhti and the other one was Muhammad Ali.
And the combination of the two was really great for people who were interested in competitive sports.
Gholamreza Takhti was the icon for lot of Iranians.
He really was the person, who for the first time, in sports, put Iran on the map.
Hossein Vaziri, the Sheik, had trained with Takhti, they were hanging around in the same circles.
So, Takhti was a role model for him.
The medals that Takhti won internationally, now Vaziri could win.
And he was well placed actually, to be the new Takhti.
To have a great deal of international success.
People came to believe that if you are internationally recognized, if you are very successful, you are going to be eliminated.
The fact that the world champion commit suicide, was unacceptable.
That became the ground for believable conspiracies.
He got off Iran in a hurry, uh, for fear of his own life.
And then he ends up in Minnesota of all places, as an assistant coach of the United States' Olympic team.
I always felt that was a little ironic.
Ladies and gentlemen, here he is Vern Gagne.
The Iron Sheik starts off training with Verne Gagne.
He was the promoter in Minnesota and Verne Gagne was also an alternate at the 1948 Olympics.
And he picks out real athletes.
He's not looking for gimmick guys.
He's looking for pure wrestlers.
I tell you, they initiate every hall with the classic wrestlers' approach.
Verne was old school guy that try to run you off, you know, if he wanted to see how tough you were, how much you really wanted to be in the business.
And so, it was a unique way of recruiting but it was a tough, tough class.
But you know, what I understand, the guys that were there,
I don't think Khosrow had any issues physically because he was just a machine.
And here was a guy that was smaller in stature, than lot of his contemporaries.
But ten times as tough.
He had the real life ability to actually hurt anybody e really wanted to, and do anything he wanted to do to them at any given time.
He could beat probably 99% of the guys in the business.
But he just didn't have the heart, he wasn't a bully.
If I did get mad at them, I can suplex them, I can give them damage.
I had a bad reputation.
He wrestles as Khosrow Vaziri, full head of black hair, very handsome man, trim, muscular, and he wears a singlet, with Olympic rings on it because he had been an assisting coach on the US Olympic team.
So, essentially he starts his career as an all-American.
I met my husband at University of Minnesota.
He was coaching the United States Olypmic wrestling team at the time when we met, back in 1975.
And I immediately fell in love with him, the moment I saw him.
180 pounds, washboard stomach, just absolutely drop dead gorgeous.
The hottest thing on two feet.
We wanted to get married but my husband was busy wrestling, and he worked everyday of the week.
So, we could never get a weekend off to get married.
So, we were married on a Saturday night, and my husband had gone to the Minneapolis Auditorium and wrestled that afternoon.
What an air ball drop!
He says USA and put the pooch right to it.
1976, the Sheik once again is an assistant coach for the US Olympic team.
And Verne Gagne, the AWA promoter is there scouring future talent,
And Mary Gagne, Verne's wife is there and she's asking Khosrow,
"Are you happy with your role in professional wrestling?"
He's like, "Well, I kind of like to be little more prominent."
And she goes, "Well, you are a Middle Eastern, why don't you make yourself a Sheik?"
The first time I met the Sheik, I was eight - nine years old, we're in Charlotte, North Carolina.
My dad was wrestling with Sheik.
He was a striking guy with an unforgettable look.
My mom had become friends with Sheik's wife, Caryl and she had come over to the house many times.
Even had the great displeasure of baby siting me on a few occasions.
Hated it, hated it, hated the mustache, hated the shaving the head to become the Iron Sheik.
He loves the bad guy, I mean, that was tailor made for him.
Hey, you people, shut up.
Let me, I'll show that punk, who the real wrestler is.
And it gets in his mind to transform himself, and play off of the core Islamaphobia perhaps that many Americans unfortunately carry.
Wrestling is funny.
Whatever is going in the world, is magnified 100 times immensely.
On November 4th, Iranian students seize the US embassy and 63 hostages.
1979, Jimmy Carter is our president.
I think Jimmy Carter is a fundamentally decent human being, but not a very tough president.
As a result, the Ayatollahs are able to hold a group of Americans hostage and parade them on television every night.
Promoters in America have always been quick to jump on any nationalistic storyline.
Iron Sheik from Iran, from Tehran, Iran, against Mr. USA, Tony Atlas.
Every promoter wants an Iranian villain.
And there is one.
Khosrow Vaziri, wrestled for the nation of Iran.
Khosrow Vaziri speaks Parsi.
Everybody call USA, USA.
And I am sick and tired of you and USA.
In the crazy world of professional wrestling, there are lot of heels and baby faces, good guys and bad guys who kinda play the role, play the part.
...that belongs to Iron Sheik, Iron Sheik is the only man...
You know, at that time I remember watching him, he did this brilliant interview with Classy Freddie Blassie as his manager.
And he goes into,
"Ayatollah tell me Sheik.
Bring back world championship belt."
Automatically you think that's not put on, that's a legit accent.
He's the real deal.
...and fighting outside the ring...
When the Iranian hostage crisis hits, and there's genuine heat, between the United States and Iran, the Iron Sheik character ignites.
The Iron Sheik is just Pearl Harboured.
He presses one, about the same type of attack culminating in the embassy.
Without warning, they struck, a defenseless person at the time...
It was a time in wrestling where a lot of people still believed that what they saw was real, or reality based.
Wrestlers will tell you, there's good heat and bad heat.
Good heat as Freddie Blassie explained to me, is when the fans boo loudly.
Bad heat is when they want to kill you.
The Iron Shiek had both.
He embraced being a heel.
It takes a certain kind of DNA and a certain kind of guy, to embrace being a bad guy, to embrace the fact that you're gonna go out there, and you're gonna get hated, you are gonna get booed.
Kill him!
Kill him!
I never had heat like this he got.
This is what we call, change the channel heat.
There's heat, like 'Yes, I wanna pay, I wanna see this guy, be beaten up by my hero.
Then there's change the channel heat, you go 'I don't like that.'
And Sheik had the right heat.
You didn't change the channel when the Iron Sheik was on.
Back in the day when he was just getting this thing rolling, the audience was very violent.
Just shut up!
Shut your bloody mouth!
This guy was real.
This guy, he'd push through it, he got the people mad.
And his arrogance shown through too.
Oh, shut up, you!
Shut your bloody mouth!
He talked to people, you know, he talked down to people.
He's better than they are.
That was the whole thing, man.
"You, arrogant son of a bitch." You know, the fellow Americans.
Deep down, I think he believed that too.
"Americans suck!"
Well, I understand that.
Jealously is a bitch.
There you see Jerry Usher, the referee kicking it in the dumpster.
If you are going to describe good and bad, from an American's viewpoint, you have the red, white and blue all American, and you are going to have a foreign menace.
So, you have the Sheik who embodies everything that we as Americans hate.
And he exploited it.
Then he got in your face and he told you, why you were weak and why as an Iranian, he could do everything.
So, he was a perfect bad guy.
Sheik made everybody humble.
'Cause of a man like this, this is why the Iranians, should not have a nuclear bomb.
He trained me when I was 16 years old.
At my dad's dungeon, taught me at my dad's house.
One of the best we got, one of my heroes.
Where the Sheik at?
Sheik is working out, he's working out with his gloves.
So, Vince walks over and says, "Sheik." "Yes, bubba.
Yes, sir."
Stands like that.
He says, "You tested positive for cocaine"
"Thank you, thank you very much, thank you."
The Iron Sheik stories are legendary.
The story of his toughness are legendary.
Of his badassery are legendary.
I am siting in the room, drinking some beers, maybe smoking a joint, and Sheik would be there with everybody else, having little toke and then he'll start doing squats.
And he'll do hundreds of squats.
Till he is dripping with sweat, I mean dripping.
I mean, he's got the constitution of a rhino.
When he drank, he got all partied up, never start fights or anything.
That was his thing, come let's party, let's have some fun.
He wasn't an asshole when he got wasted, you know what I mean.
Unless he really got trashed and all then, yes, cops were called.
I learnt everything I know from him.
A lot, well not everything but a lot.
You have to hang around this man right here.
Anybody that has never been in this man's company, damn!
The Iron Sheik is probably one of the greatest heels to ever be in the business.
And for so many years when I was a kid, there was nobody that I hated more than Iron Sheik.
He was just the epitome of what a bad guy should be.
When I was little girl, I was a tomboy, so of course, I dressed like him, and I used to go to the Metalands every month with my mom and my sister, and we used to scream and yell at the Iron Sheik and Nikolai Volkoff because I hated them so much.
Come over here.
- How you doing?
Hey, baby.
- Good to see you.
The Iron Sheik one of the first people I managed in Memphis, Tennesse.
He used to come by my house, remember, and we would drive and had some great matches down here.
One time on TV, live, one and half hour live,
Iron Sheik and I were doing an interview, a man and a boy in the city, brought their guns to TV station, they had the police out there, we had to escorted out back,
They were gonna shoot the Sheik and myself.
I was like, "Oh, my God." to be the new villain.
McMahon had great vision, he saw that, "I have potentially one of the great villains here."
That we can maximize, that we can monetize.
It will make everybody that touches the product, more money.
The key components to successful promotion, are having villains that people disdain.
I saw him in New York, Sheik was an Iranian there, who was managed by Freddie Bassie, who was my manager before that,
And Freddie Bassie says, "Nikolai, I have a deal for you and Sheik".
He's from Iran.
They have their problems, like tolak bantuan.
You are from Russia.
Cold war.
It would be the best tag team of bad guys.
Me and Sheik had so much heat already, actually we would get more heat just going to the ring than other people had wrestling.
When I was singing my Russian national anthem, I told people to stand up, that was unbelievable.
That was unbelievable.
You know people are waiting for him to fuck him up.
He didn't have to do nothing to go, "Don't say you say 'thoo'" That's it, that was the match.
Sheik would get crowd so irate, they'd be coming over the railings trying to get to him.
Because he was that evil menace.
If we can only get rid of him, that's the tip of the iceberg.
We know, he talk, he par talks to that Khamenei fellow on the phone,
I bet they got his number.
He's over here, he's a spy.
Sheik embodied that.
And they wanted to kill him.
Pull it back, this is the best brush in the whole world.
Comb your hair back.
Comb your hair back.
Alexis, come here, baby.
I wanna see your glasses.
Now, feel the papa Sheik.
Let me show you my arm.
And then you tell me, who's bigger.
Papa Sheik won.
- Papa Sheik, yeah.
- Papa Sheik won.
Beautiful.
My dad was a wrestler, and he, um, he was famous, and we used to see him when he was in between working.
We never really understood that our dad was famous when we were little.
Uh, we knew it was different because our friend's dads didn't have cartoons on Saturday mornings, they didn't have dolls of their dad.
So, we knew there was definitely something special about him and what he did.
...see Junkyard Dog back down from the fight.
Not this one.
I really didn't realize a lot, I mean, I knew it was very cool, in school a lot of kids would always ask me wrestling questions, and I didn't know, you know.
If it's fake, or wasn't fake, I didn't really, for long I never understood what they meant by "is it fake?".
My husband's career was flourishing.
His role with his daughters was limited because he was gone so much.
But when he was home, he basically, took advantage of every minute he had.
He would call all the kids over to our house, and he would train them like they were in Olympics.
And he had them running till they were all red in the face.
But all of our friends and neighbors were used to it, and they would either not play with us when our dad was in town or just run home.
And we always wanted to do that but we couldn't because our dad was the one making us do it.
I think my mom told me once, when I was born they thought I was gonna be a boy because I kicked a lot.
I guessed he'd asked her if they could take me back because he wanted a boy.
So, growing up, dating was something off-limits until we graduated from college.
He'd scream at us that he didn't have a whore house.
No boy should be calling our house.
So, we would have to sneak to talk to them when he wasn't there.
My sisters would bring boys around and the first thing he would do is take them outside and show them the Camel Clutch and show them how much he could bench-press and how much he could lift.
And then ask them to do the same.
And they inevitably never could and he just wanted to let them know how strong he was.
- Okay.
- Now, put this in wash.
It's not easy being the wife of a professional athlete.
But then again, too, I have to consider the fact that, look what he does for us by working and constantly being gone.
Professional wrestling took off as it had never had before in the 1980s.
Vince McMahon was the promoter, the one wrestling promoter that had the vision to see that wrestling wasn't gonna be done in smoke filled arenas, in little towns any more.
It had to be, like a touring event at the big arenas.
...inside cradle.
The JYD showing some wrestling moves.
He keeps sayin'...
But Vince McMahon man doesn't want WWF to remain simply in north eastern territory.
Vince McMahon wants WWF, later WWE to be an international brand.
It was a ballsy and gutsy move from Vince McMahon.
At that time, he wanted to completely take over the world of professional wrestling.
And it takes vision and it takes balls.
And you gotta have your hero and you gotta have your villain.
Listen, lady, this is my property.
Now, get out of here, you lazy American!
One!
Iran, No. 1.
The Sheik, No. 1
Wrestling wasn't gonna cross over if there weren't celebrities involved.
So Vince McMahon went out, I don't know what the terms of those deals were but he got celebrities.
He got Cyndi Lauper at the height of her fame involved with the WWF.
The celebrities coming to the garden and coming to you know, the other arenas, and essentially endorsing what Vince McMahon had created.
Wrestling in the 80s...
It was, it was crazy.
But once you went to WWF...
Fucking couldn't go nowhere.
'Cause you're everywhere.
It was a magical time.
The excitement, the buildings were...
All of them were sold out.
The Hulk Hogan era was the most influential.
The most significant of any era in the history of the business.
Hulk Hogan is unique.
Hulk Hogan had already been in Rocky III.
He'd already been on The Tonight Show.
This is an era when nobody paid any attention to wrestling.
But people were beginning to know who Hulk Hogan was.
Vince K McMahon saw that the business was changing and he had a chance for, to make a change from Backlund to Hogan.
Bob Backlund first won the WWF ttle, in 1978.
But Bob Backlund doesn't want to loose directly to Hulk Hogan.
He doesn't respect Hulk Hogan as a pure athlete.
Bob Backlund, however will loose the title to The Iron Sheik because he respects The Iron Sheik as an athlete.
And it doesn't seem far fetched that somebody with Khosrow Vaziris amateur background could pin Bob Backlund.
You knew what you were gonna do with Backlund.
You were gonna take the championship off of him after six nice years.
And let him recharge his batteries.
You were gonna start a new thing with Hulk Hogan.
The Hoganair with the guy in the middle.
The one that facilitated it, which was our Sheik.
Had to be the right guy.
The set up for success for Hulkamania, the Iron Sheik was the perfect counterpart to that.
Perfect.
Body slam!
Elbow!
He made Backlund's loss more bitter.
He made Hogan's victory more sweet.
That was the beginning of it all.
Bob Backlund did a fantastic job of giving wrestling credibility.
And then, here comes all American, Hulk Hogan.
And drops that leg and beats the Sheik.
And Bingo.
Sheik!
Sheik!
- I can't believe it's you.
- What's up, bro?
I can't believe it.
Man!
Man, I love you so much!
Great to see you.
Great to see you.
How's Melvin?
The Hulkamania thing took off and Vince Junior called me, and told me he had a great idea for the business.
He was gonna take it international.
And they wanted me to come in and they had an idea to put the gold on me and wrestle the Iron Sheik.
They talked about skyrocketing a guy, um...
It's always the matter of the right person and in the right place at the right time with the right opponent.
And so Hulk Hogan was put into the right place at the right time with the perfect opponent.
In the case of Hulkamania, not only was the Iron Sheik an integral part of that, it couldn't have happened without the Iron Sheik.
Without Hulkamania, there's no Wrestlemania.
There's probably no WWE as we know it today.
And without the Iron Sheik, there's no Hulkamania.
The fans are going wild and I'm so excited to be here.
When Vince was looking to make Hulk he had the idea of how you made Hulk you make a real American, a great American by being the worst foreign menace you can think of.
And Sheik came in and did that.
Sheik had a lot of offers.
Sheik had a lot of people in his ears,
"Snap Hogan's leg.
Don't do this. "
You know, uh... "Screw Vince over.
Beat him up."
"Torture him.
Don't do business."
He's gonna reach down inside, for that little bit of something more...
I think it would have helped wrestling if he broke his leg because...
I'm just a crude bastard.
I like heat.
You know, I think the bad guys have to come up every now and then.
And the whole thing about Hulkamania was...
You know, you wrestled him one time, man.
You're done.
And that's how they built the Hulk.
They fed him every great piece of talent, the world ever knew.
What if...
The Sheik decided to take Verne Gagne's offer and break Hulk Hogan's leg?
If he had done that, had he double crossed Hulk Hogan broken his leg and taken the Championship belt and brought it to Minneapolis, that would have been the end of this whole roll that WWF was on.
His word, by the way was important.
Gave his word to Vince McMahon, he gave his word to Hulk Hogan.
And Sheik went out and put Hogan over like a million bucks.
Not a lot of guys would have done that.
A lot of-Especially with Sheik's credentials.
If Sheik wanted to, he could tie Hogan up in a knot.
But he didn't.
He did business.
He did the right thing.
And they wanted me to come in and they had an idea to put the gold on me and wrestle the Iron Sheik.
And at one end, it was crazy that night.
The Iron Sheik was the ultimate heel.
He had more heat than anybody I had ever seen.
And he was the real deal, you know.
So I went in there and the Iron Sheik graciously passed the torch to me.
And we had a bunch of great matches.
That was really, really where my career got launched, because once the Iron Sheik put me over, the whole community thing was unstoppable.
Victory!
We have a new champion!
...Hulk Hogan blowing the horn on the Iron Sheik.
History has been made at Madison Square Garden.
The match winner.
Wrestlemania is here!
Wrestling didn't deviate from society in the 80s.
If you look at the National Football League or Baseball or NBA, NHL or Hollywood, it was a very decadent decade of the 80s.
It wasn't that wrestling had the exclusive on people making bad decisions.
Drug possession charges in the New Jersey Courtroom today.
The Sheik's fans were on hand to wish him luck outside the Middletown's Municipal Court.
The Sheik was arrested with fellow wrestler, Jim Duggan and charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine as they drove along the Garden State Parkway.
I was relatively new to WWF back then.
I came in for Wrestlemania III where I hit the Sheik.
I had 93,000 people in the Pontiac Silverdome standing up cheering, "USA!
USA!"
The place was rocking.
I was getting the big push from the company.
And everything looked really rosy.
Fly to Newark airport, there's the Iron Sheik.
He came up to me and said,
"I have no credit card.
Maybe you give me ride to show."
We get to rent a car and start heading out of the Newark airport.
The Sheik says, "Uh, maybe we stop
"and get some St. Pauli Girl beer."
Keeps drinking those cold St. Pauli Girl beers.
"Okay, Sheik.
Hell, I'll have a beer."
No sooner do I take the hit of a beer,
Jersey State troops like, went by me.
He's signaling and I'm like, I didn't see him.
And the Sheik's like, "He wants you to pull over."
And I'm like, "No.
I don't think so."
The trooper leaned over the car and said, "Step out of the car."
They'll take us in.
Now they gotta search us.
They went through my stuff.
I was cool.
And Sheik, they opened up his wallet.
Boom!
Two more grams of cocaine in two separate containers.
And they took him in front of a judge.
Finally, they brought him back.
He got bonded out.
He got a bail bond.
So we drove to Asbury Park and we're like,
"Well, maybe nobody knows."
So we actually wrestled that night in Asbury park.
And didn't tell nobody.
So I called my wife.
I said, "Honey, I got popped."
But I don't think anybody knows about it."
My wife calls me at 7:30, the next morning,
"Everybody knows."
New York daily news had made the back page...
Big picture of the Sheik.
Big picture of me.
It was like, "Boozing Bozos" was the headlines, you know.
And God, it was brutal.
Duggan and Sheik had started a program.
Duggun was this big all American just starting at WWF.
And Sheik was this horrible heel, this Iranian heel that everyone hated.
And the fact that they're riding together and doing drugs...
Smoking marijuana...
Oh my God!
"Hacksaw, say it ain't so!"
"We can believe the Sheik does it.
He's Iranian.
He's a foreigner.
Yeah well, of course.
They all do that.
They're damn foreigners."
But Duggan, "Oh my God!"
Oh yeah.
It was a little taboo.
It was not good.
My next call was to Vince McMahon.
And I remember verbatim what he said to me.
He says, "Jim, what have you done to us?"
And there was a lot of fear that people would stop watching wrestling.
Because up until this point, the common consensus was, if the fans find out that it's a work, that the matches are pre-determined, the whole thing is gonna go away.
But it was one of those last things that finally knocked down the whole curtain.
The idea that pro wrestling was on the up and out.
And it wasn't too much later, that the McMahons are testifying in front of the New Jersey Court saying,
"What we do is entertainment.
We want to be taxed.
"like entertainment not like a sporting entity."
I do remember Vince saying on TV,
"The Iron Sheik and Jim Duggan will never work for the WWF again."
Still making his way to ring.
He has for several eras and 315 pounds.
The Former World's Heavy Weight Champion...
It was an absolute devastating situation.
We all but lost our house.
He was so ashamed.
So embarrassed.
Just felt like his life was over.
He ended up on the independent circuit.
Two hundred, five hundred people.
The Mighty Maccabee, The Iron Sheik.
The Maccabee heavyweight title.
It sucks, man when you gotta do independents.
And these independents are high school gyms again, man.
Really, you know?
And it's not fun.
But you still do, 'cause you gotta provide, man.
Maccabee's got the Sheik.
He misses...
And so he had to take all these little bookings.
And it wasn't a real happy life.
One, two, three!
I was waiting for the bus one day after school and I seen a flier on the bus stop saying,
"Live Wrestling featuring the Iron Sheik and Abdul the Butcher."
Yeah!
We started like, looking into it and we went to this event.
And it was about ten years since we saw the Sheik.
Went to this place.
It's a small bar.
In a bad part of town.
And there's about a 110 people there.
There was live wrestling matches with guys who I never heard of.
And we spoke to the Sheik who was so happy to see us.
He gave us hugs and treated us like we was family.
As if you know, time you know, was never slipped away.
- Hi Sheik?
- Yeah.
It's Jian.
Jian Magen.
Oh yes.
Jian Magen.
How are you?
Good.
How are you?
Long time no speak.
My first introduction with the Iron Sheik,
I remember very, uh vividly.
My brother and I were three years old or so.
Look at me.
I remember sitting in front of my television and a man screaming in Farsi.
And I remember my mom like, dropping a pot and running into the family room and screaming, "That's your dad's friend."
"That's your daddy's friend."
There's lots of it in here.
- Where do I put this?
- Is that a pot?
I was athlete.
International table tennis player at the arena in Iran.
And back home, we were in High School.
So finally I got a hold of him and he was so proud.
He just says right away, "Come and pick me up.
I'm at hotel here, Maple Leaf Garden."
Proved to be one of the most exciting bouts in the history of professional wrestling... [] My dad would start driving usto Maple Leaf Garden.
And we would go to the show with the wrestlers.
The drug abuse tore our family apart.
It made us want to be strangers to each other.
No more effort in here no more.
Rather they know I can't do that now.
I'm too fucking old for that bullshit.
This death, this slow death of someone you love right in front of your eyes...
It hasn't happened yet.
But you know it's going to.
Just right around the corner.
We had realized at that time that if we don't do something about this like, right now, the Sheik will be just like every other wrestler who's fallen off the map and from his generation.
And at that time I decided I wanted to go to Atlanta and just be there for the Sheik because it was really getting out of control.
- Jian Magen!
- Good to see you.
- Oh Sheik, you look amazing.
- Thank you.
You look like a million bucks.
And...
It's a poem in...
Some sort of...
Serenaded by angels in memory of Marissa Vaziri.
Oh boy!
Growing up he would always protect us.
And tell us that if anybody ever touched his girls, he would kill them.
And it was very difficult for him.
I remember Marissa, um...
She had this idea.
She wanted to be a female wrestler.
And she wanted my dad to train her.
And wanted me to train her and she wanted to be one of the ladies or whatever.
You know, we never were into it very much.
We never watched it.
It wasn't our thing.
We were very girly, interesting and kind of funny that...
And my dad seemed happy about it.
He'll say, "I'll train you, you know, if you want." And um...
It was very neat that she had that dream.
She met a guy that she had only known for about a month.
And we did not know that he was a bad guy.
And I think she was trying to break up with him the night it happened and that's why he went crazy.
And something just snapped in him and he strangled her.
Nicky pulled up with her roommate.
And I guess that's when they told my husband out in the garage before they came in the house.
Khos was crying.
And shrieking outside.
And just going crazy.
It was very difficult for my father having lost Marissa.
Our father was always such a fighter and protector of his family and girls.
And the fact that somebody took her, took his daughter away from him was very difficult.
This 2000-
I love you baby.
Rest in peace.
I miss you.
Sheik took it very hard.
That fills his heart.
It's hard to come back to here.
It was in his mind.
He almost didn't have a reason to live any more.
And that was a very, very bad thing to happen to him.
He wasn't the same any more, brother.
And that's sad to see that.
I mean to feel like that.
That was...
It was his daughter, man.
He's gotten worse since my sister died, I think.
That has affected him.
Usually, he's you know, he's just worse on drugs.
He doesn't seem to care and does a lot.
It's like the main thing that he hates about her.
Yeah.
The death of his daughter was the beginning of the end for the Sheik.
It was his lowest point.
And he didn't even know how to communicate with anybody.
He would just go out into the streets and pick fights.
And turn to drugs.
And just really, just be very, very, very uncontrollable.
Sure.
- Darius, you gotta drive.
- All right.
All right.
I know.
- What do you mean?
- He has to drive.
- Who?
- Darius.
Don't worry about him!
Are you the man or he's the man?
Who is the older?
Is the man?
Is he Iranian?
Mind this man here and he know how to drive.
If you make a joke, don't insult the Mr. Darius.
- Say you're sorry.
- No.
I'm sorry but you know where I'm coming from.
I don't give a fuck where you come from.
But you never insult a legend.
I pushed him over the edge to drugs.
That's all we all did, man.
We medicate.
If that hurts so bad then why do something about it?
Get medicated Don't feel it no more.
Blocks it.
He'll probably buy bourbon.
No.
I remember a wrestler telling me that it made him sick at himself.
That he's the one that turned Sheik on the cocaine.
And he hated himself for it.
'Cause Sheik like myself, we liked that shit.
And if I like it, I'm gonna fucking have it.
It had ruined my life
And it didn't help Sheik too.
He's only half existing, basically.
He's so caught up with smoking dope and grabbing a few beers.
I mean, that's his whole existence.
He used to be an alcoholic.
But, then he quit that and then he basically went to the... crack and cocaine and then the marijuana.
All set.
And now, it's pretty much, I think, the crack and the marijuana.
And, he's always, always, everyday looking for money.
Yeah, I got it.
- You ready to go?
- Ready.
Let's go.
Your ankle...
You keep...
You keep on leaning on your ankle.
I'm...
I'm okay.
So, I go to Atlanta, about two or three years after the death of Marissa.
Not knowing what to expect.
In my head, I thought I was going to see a... destitute Sheik.
I thought the Sheik was broke because he would always call me... asking me for money.
And I would send it to him because...
Forty or fifty dollars... wasn't a big deal for me, especially, when my childhood hero is asking me for it.
And when I get there...
It was kind of a...
A bit of a... shock.
I...
I didn't realize that...
The Sheik's got this beautiful family.
Of...
loving children and a loving wife.
The reality is... they've been living with... a crazed wrestler for the past twenty, thirty years.
You're still...
You're still solid.
You're gonna...
You wanna walk in as the champion?
You wanna walk in as the iron Sheik.
No matter where you are, you want everyone to know you're the Sheik.
- The kids at the window are looking.
- Yeah.
Next time, change your shoes, man.
I know, at one point, The Sheik, in his desperation to make money... would sit in the Ramada, in Mavi, and he would wait for fans to come by and recognize him, which they invariably did.
And when they did recognize him, he would sell them an eight by ten glossy, an autographed picture for ten bucks.
Which, from what I understand, would then be used to subsidize his drug habit.
God.
God.
No one can control him.
Believe me.
No one.
Tuesday.
I would talk to his friends, when they were alive.
And, they would try.
Didn't work.
So, I'm in the Vaziri house.
And...
I'm trying to figure it out, as I go, because...
I was expecting something completely different, than what I was seeing.
And, here you have Caryl, who is very aware of what's going on.
She's very in tune with The Sheik and his mannerisms.
She knows the real Sheik and she knows...
Khosrow Vaziri.
That's the man that she married.
And so...
I was learning all this as I was going along.
And I really wanted her to know that... we care for her and we have her back.
And, how can we do this together?
How can we help you guys... get The Sheik off of the drugs?
And, what do we have to do?
Where is our place in this?
We were about to fall asleep.
If it's so important, where have you been?
There's no fighting.
Uh uh.
We're just talking.
When are you gonna answer my question?
It was five minutes ago, before you got off on your tirade.
I asked you if you were gonna pray to God and ask him for help... in getting yourself straightened out and off of all the drugs.
A simple yes or no will suffice.
Okay, that's my answer.
Can't you get that feeling some other way?
There are ways to get rid of that.
Don't give me "come on"!
It kills.
It kills the way you function.
It kills...
It kills your emotions.
And it... and it... and it completely...
It makes you less than, of...
of what you once were.
So, how're you gonna change your future?
Why're you yellin'?
I'm asking you, how're you gonna change your future?
I told you hundred times, you're the man.
Why're you yellin' at me?
No, that's drugs.
Then, so, why would you yell at me?
You're the legend.
Your time has passed.
You'll always be a legend.
And no one can take that away from you.
So, maybe... if you know I care about you, you know I love you, and you know that I'm only thinking about your best interest.
Well, why don't you listen to what I'm saying?
Some of this is getting a little bit outta hand.
Like...
I'm going to hate him.
I guess he just needs it.
Guess, he just needs it.
I think, there's no way around it if he's working.
He needs it.
Sheik got lucky, because, he did enough drugs...
Er... at one time that would have killed a normal man.
At this stage of his life, he said, I've...
I've had enough.
I'm done.
I'm done with that.
Baby, you don't need that.
Take that one off.
You don't need that.
It's probably the hardest thing a person can do.
Is to quit drugs.
The Sheik's family couldn't really abide by his habit.
And his wife left.
And you work with people who are sick or you get them help.
And that's what we've always done.
And he ended up in a little apartment, not far from his daughter.
Hoping to reconcile with his wife.
And hoping for acceptance from his two surviving daughters.
But, they had conditions.
The most, a preeminent one... was that he cease and desist his crack use.
Okay.
And put that fan a little bit down.
We're moving forward.
It's getting better.
There's bad days, there's good days.
But, there's more good days than bad days.
He has managed to... conquer his drug addiction and I truly believe... that's a permanent victory.
I think he values his family too much to risk losing them again.
Let me translate for you.
I think, going to Atlanta was the defining moment...
Er, of our relationship.
The Sheik was one of the most untapped talents out there.
A lot of these wrestlers were just wavering around in dependence.
And The Sheik had this... untapped gold, that was just waiting to be developed.
Youtube was just starting.
The timing was, was when Michael Richards, Kramer... from Seinfeld... er, was on stage at a comedy club in Los Angeles.
And he... dropped the "N" bomb... on someone in the crowd.
And I go, Sheik, I want you to watch this.
I want you to watch this and then I'm gonna film you...
I want you to tell me what your thoughts were on this.
And we posted it.
And within, like, four days we had, like, a half a million views.
We got freaked out.
We were like, holy shit!
Like...
The Sheik's really popular.
This is crazy.
Yeah, but, you have to tell me that too many... too much...
They look perfect on you.
I don't give a fuck.
I have to let you know about future.
Yo, man, chill out, man.
Fuck you!
Take a walk!
Don't worry about that.
Some of those things are embarrassing, beyond belief.
But, I think, the reason he does it is to just get the publicity.
Camel Clutch!
Holy Shit!
Camel Clutch!
Don't fucking tell me again sorry!
So, I try and explain to Caryl that... there's this movement coming along and... everything is going online and...
The Sheik doesn't necessarily need to go and wrestle any more, in order to get a payday.
This is on the news.
We made the World News.
Er, here he is.
The Iron Sheik.
There he is.
Wonderful to see you, Iron Sheik.
Wonderful.
What an honor.
What an honor.
What an honor.
This is a wrestler.
He was just signed to the WWE.
He calls himself, Iron Sheik Junior.
I am the real Iron Sheik.
You are fagot!
Come over here.
I suplex you.
I fuck your ass.
I make you humble.
You hear me?
That was really when it started kicking in, because...
The Sheik was out of control... but he was channeling it... to the biggest audience in the world.
Chael Sonnen, you talk and you walk.
That's why I respect you.
But a still, Iron Sheik have AAU champion.
And a Hall of Fame and gold medal.
You will some day had it.
But I respect you and have a good day.
I concede.
I concede to you, Sheik.
Enjoy yourself.
Have fun my friends.
Thank you, sir.
At a time mankind has been forced to compete for survival.
Oh, my God!
- Sheik.
- Yes, sir.
World champion, Iron Sheik.
He, er, was very popular.
He was being referenced... in different situations on television.
Er, he got cameos for movies.
Elvis!
I'm gonna find you!
And I'm gonna your ass!
So, we started getting a world of phone calls and a world of... different inquiries that were... all... "not wrestling".
Aaaah!
You dumb son of a bitch!
And Twitter came along.
Some people, around the world, come to social media, specifically to The Iron Sheik's Twitter page... to see who he calls a tic tac dick.
Or, a grasshopper balls.
Something like that.
It's off the charts... er, crazy, in terms of the things that he comes up with.
Er, which I tip my hat to that.
Because, I love a great trash talker.
And...
And Sheik is the best.
It's time to play Iron Sheik, the Real or Jabroni.
If you're not following The Iron Sheik on Twitter, then you hate awesome things, because...
The Iron Sheik, alternatively, praises and attacks people on Twitter.
And it's, it's very clear which one he's doing.
I'm going to name something, or, someone and for 250 points you have to tell me if The Sheik likes it... by saying, Real, or, hates it, by saying, Jabroni.
Okay, you guys ready?
You guys ready?
Here's the first one.
Ray J, Ray J. Real or Jabroni?
Yes, Judd?
- Jabroni.
- No, real, he likes Ray J.
Ray J... that cheeseburger ass penguin Kim K he deserve gold medal.
Wow!
I follow Sheik on Twitter.
And I know a lot of people who do.
And I... always go check a lot of his stuff.
Because it's like, you know...
You wonder sometimes, you know...
Did he really come up with that?
Or... you know, er, is he serious?
We know he's not serious.
But he's, er, he's funny.
He's funny.
He...
And it's pretty good that you can be funny in 140 characters.
So, when I read them, I hear him talking.
And, to me, that's...
That's pretty authentic.
That's pretty good.
We try and keep the tweets as... precise as possible.
The Sheik, his English is bad, and so... all we're doing is taking his words and putting them on... to the computer.
How he articulates it... that's Sheik.
And then a Twitter conference came and we got there and... the guy working there was, like, holy shit!
You're The Iron Sheik.
I'm like, yes, he is.
You have something you wanna say?
Sheik, Sheik.
That's great.
Hulk Hogan was the best of all time.
At this very moment, The Sheik is a social media phenomenon.
You better believe it, brother.
What's Hitler going to do, when these 24 pythons come for you?
Hogan!
I know nothing!
The idea to put him on Robot Chicken probably never would have happened if we hadn't... er, seen him on Twitter.
But we'd been following him on Twitter for a year.
Um...
So, there was this great two pack of... er, action figures, with The Iron Sheik and Nikolai Volkoff.
I took a picture of them and I, I tweeted it.
I said, um, look who stopped by... er, the Robot Chicken writer's room today.
And I said, guys, we're gettin' The Sheik on the show this year.
We have this rope, those flashlights, the fake passports, Playboys and, er, this.
Oh, yeah!
Slabber doo, a Slim Jim!
Holy...
A Slim Jim!
I just love Slim Jims!
I follow The Sheik on Twitter.
Yeah, he always, er...
He's a different kind of fashion police.
Like, Joan Rivers will speak her mind, but, The Iron Sheik will tell it like it is.
Sheik's a cult figure.
When people see The Iron Sheik... they react.
They are celebrities.
They're people in the hip hop world.
They're people who consider themselves hipsters.
They are people in the art world.
I just want to, er...
I want to bring out someone who has been a... inspiration to me.
A childhood hero of mine.
Er, he wants to say a few words about hating.
We would go to these events.
In which... the biggest celebrities in the world were there.
And, they all knew The Iron Sheik.
They all loved The Iron Sheik.
I fear him.
I respect him.
And I love him.
I love you.
Looking back... as a 33 year old, or, a 30 year old, or, a four year old... they were watching wrestling in 1985.
They were watching...
Hulk Hogan and The Iron Sheik.
They remember the match.
- Yo, it's The Iron Sheik
- Yeah, brother.
This side, this side, this side, this side.
And it took people... out of their celebrity bubble.
And into this... innocent, human... place that they felt connected to... that they wanted to share.
Oh, my God!
The Sheik!
The Sheik!
The Sheik!
The King is here!
When I came to this country... you know, I had nothing.
And all of a sudden...
The WWF was in my life.
Because that's, that was like the biggest thing that we had as kids, was watching the WWF.
We were so happy to have somebody represent us.
And, at one point, he held the belt.
Do you remember that?
He had the belt.
We just... just think that was the biggest thing in our lives.
And he had the belt.
He was the champion of the world.
And...
It made me feel... empowered, as a kid.
One...
Two... three!
Okay.
What do you think about wearing this tonight?
What's wrong with it?
Toronto mayor, Rob Ford, seems to be in a little bit of trouble because a video is being shopped around that purports to show him smoking crack.
Our job is to expose him and put him out there.
And get him... some attention.
All the media, CNN, NBC, ABC, they're all there.
Right.
You are gonna go interrupt the mayor and say... that's not the mayor, I'm the new mayor of the Toronto.
Can we talk to him, right here?
It's tough for these wrestlers whose lives, kind of... are dependent on their... abilities in the ring.
When those abilities go away... they are not left with much more.
This is for... the most offensive man.
Did I get this for a reason?
And the winner is...
The Iron Sheik.
Hey, Toronto!
Please put your hands together for The Iron Sheik!
We worked hard to establish his... social media presence.
And... it's a daily grind, every day, we do... er, whatever we can to get The Iron Sheik noticed, online.
And, we're having a good time doing it.
It's a lot of fun and it feels good.
Especially, knowing that...
He's our childhood hero.
And we have his back and he has ours.
Gimme a hell yeah!
Hell Yeah!
His impact on my career, er, has really been profound.
Wrestling business has always been a cutthroat business.
There weren't always a lot of guys, at that time, who took the time... to... bring me under their wings and share their insight and wisdom with me.
I was... humbled that he took such great time... and care to... in many ways, mentor me.
And, in his way, that was very, um...
He was a hard ass.
But, but I appreciate that and, at that time... as a rookie, I needed that.
This and this...
And change.
That...
He was in a position where he didn't have to give me that much time and I just wanted to be a sponge and pick his brain.
And I'll never forget, I'll never, ever forget...
It was a very long flight and he, he's like...
Bubba, let me tell you...
He said...
He said, you go into the locker room.
You sit down.
You keep a your mouth shut.
You open your ears and you just listen to everybody, okay?
Don't be the Jabroni and talk a lot.
Let your talent... and your ability a speak for itself.
That's, that's a smart.
Don't be the Jabroni
I want you to show me how much you have a balls or guts... till you can take down each other... or, pin each other.
Double leg, take him down, go for a pin.
Show me.
And you are taller and bigger...
Uh uh uh uh...
Show me your...
Excellent!
Beautiful!
Let me tell you something about the word, Jabroni.
So...
I was very lucky and fortunate to have... coined the word, Jabroni... publicly, on TV.
Utilize it as part of my Rock speak.
And had it become part of, um... pop culture.
You know, The Rock says...
This Jabroni needs to go down, blah, blah, blah, you know.
I'd say things like that and...
It doesn't matter, Jabroni.
It was Jabroni, Jabroni, Jabroni.
And now, the word, Jabroni, is connected...
Er, to me.
When A lot of people think, oh, Jabroni, oh, yeah, yeah.
It's The Rock's word.
No, no, no, no.
It's not my word.
It's The Iron Sheik's word.
Iron Sheik was the one who... would use the word, Jabroni backstage.
And it became this legendary...
Iron Sheik speak.
It was always... you tell the Jabroni.
Let me tell you, Jabroni.
It was Jabroni, Jabroni, Jabroni.
I give The Iron Sheik... all the credit... in the world, for the word...
Jabroni.
Jabroni, especially when he told me, don't be the Jabroni.
Keep your mouth shut.
This is the man that made my career, right here.
I think, er, fans remember him as, as one of the classic heels of his... of his generation.
And one of those guys who, er, you know... who will always be recognizable.
There's not a guy who walks in and doesn't instantly recognize The Sheik.
You know, he's, er, he's iconic.
The man from Tehran...
Iran.
With his Persian clubs...
Er, and his incredible wrestling background and soldier's mentality, represented how... there is no success, without struggle.
He represented that hard work pays off.
He was all things that make America great.
My papa, Sheik, was a wrestler.
My papa Sheik was a wrestler.
And he was a champion, you said it.
He is strong and he works out a lot to get strong.
Our dad was, was portrayed as the Iranian villain, I think, it was...
In his wrestling career.
But it was... extremely ironic, because...
I've never met another individual in my life, who embraced this country more than our dad.
America has always been the land of opportunity.
And he came here with nothing.
And he's had a... forty plus year career.
Living here in this country.
Raising a family.
So, I don't know how we could argue the fact that
Khosrow hasn't achieved the American dream.
He's a hero to many, many people everywhere, all throughout the world.
And rightfully so.
Sheik!
Sheik!
Sheik!
Sheik!
Ach thoo!
Iron Sheik, Number 1.
Cameraman, zoom it.
Brother Sheik, number 1.
Iron Sheik, number 1.
Iron Sheik, number 1.
Iron Sheik, number 1.
Number 1, hack ptoeey!
Iron Sheik, number 1.
From Tehran, Iran.
## Reyaansh ##
Previously on "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...
WhywouldS.H.I.E.L.D. keep details of your death from you?
What happened in Tahiti?
Director Fury ...
He had a team of scientists working around the clock
- I wanted to die.
- And we should have let you.
Once we capture Quinn, we'll be one step closer to the Clairvoyant.
- Where's Skye?
- Agent Coulson, it's dangerous... sending her in like that, all alone.
Oh.
Oh, god.
Hang on.
- Put her in there!
- Is it working?
!
We need to get her to a medical facility and fast.
1x14
- T.A.H.I.T.I.
She was shot twice in the abdomen at close range almost two hours ago.
She's tachycardic, hypotensive, and lost a significant amount of blood.
We had to lower her core body temp in order to transport her here.
It's probably what kept her alive this long.
We'll do everything we can.
- Oh, dear.
I'm a mess.
- No.
You were great.
Intubate, and let's start getting that shirt off.
Okay, let's prep her for ex-lap.
I'm here.
That's unacceptable.
I need to speak to Director Fury immediately, please.
Why didn't I stop her?
- I could have.
- As if you could stop Skye doing anything she's set her mind to.
I shouldn't have let her go after Quinn by herself.
What was I thinking?
It's not your fault.
She shouldn't have been there.
I'm her S.O. It's on me.
The one to blame is the man who shot her, Ian Quinn.
He's responsible.
Yes, the message is, I have an agent dying, and there are questions only he can answer.
- How is she?
- Not good.
The shots perforated her stomach and penetrated the large and small intestines.
We resected what we could, but...
- there's been too much damage.
- So what's next?
We can keep her comfortable, but you'll need to make a decision on whether or not you want to keep her on life support.
You're saying there's nothing to be done?
I'm saying you need to call her family and get them here as soon as possible.
We're her family.
In that case, I'm very sorry.
Finally.
I was beginning to think you'd forgotten ...
Ohh.
Wait!
You can't!
Why?
'Cause you're defenseless, like she was?
May!
May!
Outside, now.
He deserves to die, not her!
Agreed.
But right now, Quinn doesn't matter ... only Skye does, and I need you to pilot the plane.
You heard what the doctor said.
She said there was nothing more they could do for her, but there are doctors who brought me back from the dead.
If they can do that, I'm betting they can save Skye.
## Reyaansh ##
H.Q. radioed in.
They've ordered us to hand over Quinn for interrogation and transport to the fridge.
Do you want me to arrange the transfer?
No.
Quinn stays in our custody until I say otherwise.
Yes, sir.
Are you sure about this, taking her all the way to Bethesda?
It's where my file says I was treated after New York.
I understand, but what makes you think the doctors there will be able to do anything different?
- I know they saved you, but ...
- They did a lot more than save me.
It's time you know the truth.
That can't be.
What you're describing ...
it's medically impossible.
Except for the fact that I'm standing here ... proof that it's not impossible.
And here's more proof ... my file, describing how they brought me back ... the doctors, the procedures, the drugs.
Sir... it's against the law for us to read this.
- Are you sure?
- I don't care about your clearance level.
I'm ordering you to read it.
"Death and recovery report."
It's only recently that director Fury gave me access to this.
I've gone over it dozens of times.
I need you to decipher the medical parts of it
I didn't understand.
Feel free to reach out to Dr. Streiten.
He should be eager to answer any questions you may have.
Yes, I'm sure I'll have quite a few.
- So, what about Tahiti?
- Turns out, not so magical, just false memories implanted to cover up what was done.
Sir... it says here your heart was perforated, torn in half.
That part of it I understood.
And yet, they managed to heal the damaged tissue completely.
We need to understand how.
- So we can do the same for Skye.
- That's what I'm counting on.
- We'll get right on it, sir.
- Thank you.
- Hurt much?
- I'm fine.
Coulson told me how long he was dead.
But you already knew that, didn't you?
I saw Skye... in the pod, machines filtering her blood, breathing for her.
I'm not sure I'd make this play ... fly halfway around the world hoping for a second miracle.
If Coulson thinks there's a chance in a million to save Skye, to save any of us, he'd take it.
People like us ...
we need people like him.
So, yeah, it makes sense ... a lot more sense than the alternative.
- You mean giving up?
- Or killing the man responsible.
I did like seeing you go after Quinn.
You don't open the blinds like that very often.
S.H.I.E.L.D. 616, this is tower Michael Tango.
You are in violation of S.H.I.E.L.D. directive 1297.
- Respond immediately.
- Disobeying a direct order.
We didn't hand Quinn over for interrogation.
Great.
This is S.H.I.E.L.D. 616.
How do we proceed?
Prepare to be boarded and relinquish command.
Really?
All the war and chaos in the world, and S.H.I.E.L.D. sends a plane after us?
Three planes ...
a small transport to dock and a pair of F-35s to make sure we hand over Quinn.
If they scratched my paint, I'm gonna be pissed.
I'll await your orders, sir.
Garrett?
What the hell are you doing here?
Well, as opposed to the level 8 jackass I'm staring at,
- I still follow orders.
- You're the worst at following orders.
Maybe... but I like this one.
You are to immediately turn Ian Quinn over for transport to the fridge.
Agent Antoine Triplett, Agent Phillip Coulson.
You wouldn't know it to look at him, but Phil's one of our finest.
An honor, sir.
Trip joined me as my specialist after Ward came to your circus.
- Go secure the prisoner.
- Yes, sir.
Phil, come on.
Just because Fury gave you this pretty plane doesn't mean they won't shoot it out of the sky.
Why are you really here, Garrett?
S.H.I.E.L.D. could have sent any security team to collect Quinn.
Why you?
- You've been chasing him, too!
- Since Malta.
Then yesterday, your little Italian job cost my team weeks of work.
- You can't have him, not yet.
- This isn't a request.
Quinn shot one of my agents.
She's on life support in a med pod downstairs.
We are taking her to the trauma center in Bethesda.
Quinn actually pulled the trigger?
Skye infiltrated his compound in Malta.
When he saw her yesterday, seems he took it personally.
I never took him for a triggerman.
He pays others for that.
I've lost three of my own chasing him.
Then you understand why I can't give him to you until we save my agent.
Because if she doesn't make it...
- Agent Grant Ward.
- Trip.
- Is Garrett upstairs?
- Yeah.
You know, he still talks about that thousand-yard shot you took in Bandung.
It was 2,000.
So, what are you doing here?
Man, this is like the Playboy jet.
I mean, a guy could get soft bunking in a space like this.
How did Coulson swing such a sweet ride?
- He died.
- That's tight.
You want to point me to the box you're keeping Quinn?
H.Q. ordered Garrett to haul his ass to the fridge for questioning.
- Is that a full bar?
- You're welcome to it.
But, uh, Quinn stays put till Coulson says otherwise.
Come on, man.
Garrett was your S.O., too, so you know how this works.
- Why don't you remind me?
- Garrett wants Quinn.
It's my job to make sure Garrett gets what he wants.
- Now where is he?
- Can't help you with that.
No worries.
I'll find Quinn myself.
I'm sure he's tucked between the jacuzzi and the squash court.
Hey.
Agent Ward, stand down.
Agent Garrett and I have come to an agreement.
He convinced H.Q. he could interrogate Quinn here on our plane as we continue to Bethesda.
Well, I'm a bit of a sweet talker when I need to be.
You wouldn't believe what I could talk this son of a gun into.
- Good seeing you, son.
- You, too, sir.
And thank you.
Saving the girl's top priority, and she might know something.
I've never heard of half the drugs they gave Coulson ...
GH-325?
And what about this robotic-assisted- neural-micro-surgery they used to implant the Tahiti memories?
- It all sounds so diabolical.
- I agree.
We can't argue with the results.
He's walking around.
Yeah but at what cost?
You read the transcripts.
He begged the doctors to let him die.
This is different.
Skye's still alive.
We have to keep her that way.
Oh.
I've asked Dr. Streiten to advise us.
Hello.
Yes.
Are you sure?
That can't be.
And here I thought I was gonna get to play bad cop.
Ian Quinn, this is Agent Garrett.
- He's here to ask you some questions.
- Oh, no, thank you.
I ... my head's still ringing from the last visitor.
At least the last visitor left you with a head.
I'm not always that considerate.
I'm interested in one of your newer projects.
Hmm?
Oh, but there are so many to choose from.
Let me be clear ... you have no rights.
You have no lawyer.
The only thing keeping Agent Coulson here from throwing you out of this plane is the very weak heartbeat of a young agent downstairs, and the only incentive I have for not tearing your tongue out is that you use it to answer my questions.
Is that clear?
Mm-hmm.
- You understand that?
- No.
Tell us about Cybertek and the Deathlok program.
- Deathlok?
- Catchy, right?
Sounds like some wrestler from the '80s.
What is it really?
Those are dangerous waters, and the last agent that waded into them wound up with two in the stomach.
So... she's still alive?
Yeah.
And you better hope she stays that way.
Is that why you shot Skye, because she saw what Cybertek delivered?
No.
I shot Skye because that's what the Clairvoyant told me to do.
You wanted to see me?
I just got off the phone with the trauma center in Bethesda.
Dr. Streiten's gone off the grid.
So we'll find a different doctor there who operated on Coulson.
- That's the thing.
Actually...
- Coulson was never treated there.
- You're not making sense.
- None of this makes sense.
The doctors listed, the operating-room number ... none of them exist.
None of them are part of S.H.I.E.L.D.
What I find surprising is how a big-shot billionaire could fall for this psychic mumbo jumbo.
Oh, I doubted it at the beginning, but then I realized it would be mutually beneficial.
He must have something pretty terrible on you.
Shooting an unarmed girl?
Let's just say I learned the hard way that obeying was in my best interest.
Yet... here you are.
Let me assure you it wasn't luck that led me to your partner's black sedan in Berlin or that he'd open the door for a redhead or those two agents in Morocco.
Do you think it was just a roll of the dice that my people found them in that Riad?
No, it was the Clairvoyant.
Your Clairvoyant say anything about me knocking your teeth in?
The Clairvoyant sees everything except what happened to him.
This is still about me.
Wait.
You're gonna need to rewind the tape, Phil.
You heard about my near-death before the battle of New York?
There's more to it than that.
I thought I was gone for seconds ...
- turns out it was days.
- That's impossible.
Which is why the Clairvoyant will do anything to know how it happened.
- Even order you to shoot Skye.
- Wait.
You don't know what S.H.I.E.L.D. did to save you.
That's why we're flying to where I was treated.
So shooting the girl forces you to figure it all out.
- So the Clairvoyant can finally see.
- Or you let the girl die.
Quinn shot Skye for nothing.
The place we were going, the doctors who treated you ...
- they don't exist.
- Or maybe they exist somewhere else.
This is S.H.I.E.L.D. There are always secrets.
That's my fear, sir.
Your file is filled with secrets ... experimental drugs, unknown surgical procedures we've never even heard of.
Frankly, Fitz and I only understand about 70% of what's in here.
Even if we do find where they treated you and we were able to replicate the procedure, there's the other obvious question.
- Which is?
- Whether we should.
What you experienced, sir, if this file is even partially accurate ...
No one's suggesting that we submit Skye to everything that I went through, but if there's something in here ... a drug, a treatment that can save her, we need to find it.
- Figure it out.
- Yes, sir.
- You disagree.
- No.
I think we need to do everything humanly possible to save Skye.
But we need to acknowledge that doing so might give the Clairvoyant exactly what he wants.
It's a risk we have to take.
How is she?
Deteriorating, and I don't know how to stop it.
The only thing I've found remotely interesting
- is something called "GH-325."
- Some kind of drug?
Agent Coulson was injected with that, and literally minutes later, his wounds showed signs of cellular regeneration.
Regeneration?
Is that even possible?
Even if this miracle drug does exist, we don't know where to find it.
We have no coordinates, no logs of anyone's departure or arrival.
I think maybe I can help with that.
- You've set up the echo-chamber.
- Yeah, I made a couple of calls.
A buddy of mine works in the archives at the Triskelion.
Agreed to let us access it from here.
Hard to believe, but this cube contains all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s historical administrative data.
Yeah, but if Agent Coulson's operation didn't take place at a S.H.I.E.L.D. medical facility ...
We won't find any record of it here ...
I know.
But this also contains all interoffice memos, travel arrangements, purchase orders.
Maybe we can track down the location through a virtual paper trail of some sort or another.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, let's start with the travel memoranda from the date Coulson got stabbed.
Here we go.
Or, um, what about Dr. Streiten's departure from the Triskelion?
- Maybe they have that.
- Yeah.
- Here.
This is interesting.
- A World War II bunker?
"Collapsed" bunker.
Definitely not a sanctioned S.H.I.E.L.D. facility.
- "The Guest House"?
- Exactly.
Guest House ...
G.H. GH-325.
Look at the file's access history.
- The only record of it being opened...
- Is by a level 10 operative.
Director Fury.
So, Fury's been to this place, and he's the person who sanctioned the operations on Agent Coulson.
And why aren't you trying to find the file?
Ah, damn.
Encrypted.
Skye could crack this.
What would she do?
It's not an encryption.
The Guest House is not a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility.
We don't know who or what's in there.
- Be prepared for potential resistance.
- No contact from inside?
I've tried every known channel ... no response.
- Place could be abandoned.
- Let's hope not.
We need the people inside to work on Skye.
Simmons is prepping Skye to move at a moment's notice, sir.
Trip can help.
He's had med-tech training.
Good.
We do our jobs right, this will all go peacefully.
- What if they don't want to help us?
- I'll say "pretty please."
We need the doctors alive and the place intact.
If it does go sideways, Fitz, I need you down there to determine what Simmons can use to help Skye.
And then we take it.
Let's move.
Company?
Nothing's scheduled for a couple weeks.
Try the protocol.
How was the drive from Istanbul?
- Countersign?
- No clue.
- Never heard it.
- I can't find it in any of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s protocol directives.
This is Agent Coulson with S.H.I.E.L.D.
We don't know the counter, but we have a team member in dire need of medical assistance.
We know she can be treated here.
Open the doors.
Maybe we can work something out.
Do you copy?
How was the drive from Istanbul?
We're looking for medical assistance.
A person's life is at stake.
Will you help us?
How was the drive from Istanbul?
"Pretty please" it is.
These guys are good...
hacked their way in.
How the hell did they find this place?
Doesn't matter.
Didn't know the countersign.
- You want left or right?
- Left's good.
There's an antechamber and a set of glass doors.
Can't see much beyond that.
Lights are all out.
Well, they know we're coming.
Let's go say "hello."
Clear.
Okay, Simmons, we're going in now.
Simmons?
Damn it.
Comms are down.
There's too much mountain on top of us.
Trust me ... it's better.
You don't want them hearing the horrible death we're walking into.
Humor, son.
You Brits are too serious.
- Besides, if the job was easy...
- It wouldn't be any fun.
I'm not afraid ... not yet.
I suspect the real danger won't happen until we breach that bulletproof glass.
Probably a stairwell back to the surface.
What do you think, Fitz?
Can you get us inside?
To certain, horrible death?
Absolutely.
Okay, sir, just say the word.
Once we get inside, everybody find cover.
All right, gentlemen, here we go.
We've come for medical assistance.
But you continue firing on us, we will defend oursel...
- I count two hostiles.
- Copy that.
Ready?
You got one of those little flash things?
Yeah.
Ward!
Clear!
- See if you can get some lights on.
- Yeah.
No hard feelings, Bob.
Clear.
We're not done.
This one's hit.
Shouldn't be too hard to find.
Go.
We're gonna get you medical help.
Is anyone else down here?
Where are the doctors?
Med staff doesn't stay here.
We're looking for a drug ...
GH-325.
It might help you, too.
- Do I... k-know you?
- I don't know.
I-I might have spent some time here awhile back.
Then you know about... the timer.
We got a problem!
Semtex.
The whole place is rigged to blow.
There's enough explosive to bring down the whole mountain on top of us.
Sir.
Less than 10 minutes.
It's probably a failsafe.
If the guards had eliminated us, they'd stop the timer.
Since they didn't...
It's some kind of emergency override.
Skye could probably get past it, but I can't hack the panel, which means we're trapped in here.
You're the guy who taught Ward how to disarm nuclear bombs.
Figure out a way to get us out of here.
Let's go find the drug.
So this is some sort of medical facility.
Yeah, but if nobody's here, I'm not sure it's gonna do us any good.
Tough when it's your team.
You guys go back a ways?
Not really.
A few months.
We have nothing in common ...
couldn't be more different.
But you can't imagine your life without her.
Yes.
You've experienced that, Agent Triplett?
I have.
Sometimes, a person takes you by surprise.
Yeah.
She's very lucky to have you.
I know anything bad ever happens to me, hope you're in my corner, too.
Comms are down.
If I don't hear anything within the hour, I'm going after them.
Skye's coding.
Both of you, now.
How can we help?
I need a unit of Epi.
Got it.
Don't.
Let me die.
Please.
Let me die!
- Is that where...
- Yeah.
The timer doesn't control the explosion.
It's just a clock.
Detonator must be somewhere else.
It's not in here, or I'd have found it.
There's no time to search the whole compound.
Maybe we can take some semtex, use it on the doors.
Sir, are you sure you want to?
We should put suits on before we go in there.
You're right, but there's no time.
I wish I could speak to Simmons.
She'd know what most of this stuff is ... or, at least, what stuff not to touch.
Uh...
Fitz.
Oh.
I don't see any G.H...
Agent Coulson.
It's locked.
Here.
Put these on.
Got it.
Time to go.
We couldn't stop it.
Four minutes and counting.
Almost there.
There's semtex throughout here, as well.
This is it ... 325.
- This is the one we want.
- We gotta go.
- Get it up to Simmons.
- Yeah.
Sir.
I'll be right behind you.
Go.
Three minutes.
Have you worked much with munitions, Agent Fitz?
Explosives are a fascinating specialty ... very exacting.
Too big a concussion could trigger a chain reaction ... bury us like fossils for a thousand years.
Guess we don't have to worry about the Clairvoyant finding this place.
Agent Ward...
would you do the honors?
Thought you'd never ask.
Can you slip through?
- Yeah.
- Go.
All right.
Get that drug up there.
- Coulson.
- Where the hell is he?
Phil!
Go with Fitz.
Make sure that drug gets to the girl.
- Agent Garrett.
- Go!
Save the girl.
Weak, erratic heart rate.
Each time we save her, I ask myself, "is this what Skye would want?"
We didn't come this far to quit.
Getoff...
the ground immediately.
They're alive.
Maybe we can ...
Fitz, come in.
What's your status?
Phil!
Phil, what the hell?
Clock's not slowing down.
- It's about to get really warm in here.
- Hey, you with me?
The guys are out already.
They took the drug up to Skye.
No, don't give it to her.
The drug ... they can't give it to her!
All right.
You can tell them yourself.
Right now, we just need to get out of this mountain and off the ground.
Now let's go.
You want more epinephrine?
- We found it.
- What is it?
And how much, injected where?
May, get us off the ground, or it'll fall out from under us.
No!
Don't give it to her!
I was losing her, anyway.
What harm can it do?
Come on, girl.
It's working.
She'sspiking.
Stop it.
How can we stop it?
Skye!
- What's happening?
- I don't know...
Skye!
Do something ...
we have to do something!
Her heartbeat ... she's stabilizing.
Simmons?
Could someone tell me what we just saw?
The girl's a fighter.
What was that stuff you just gave her?
I don't know.
All I know is that it worked.
You're a real miracle worker.
You did it.
Something happen down there?
I'm not sure.
One minute, he was fine.
The next, it was like he had seen a ghost.
I have good news and bad news.
Which would you like to hear first?
Bad news, then ...
there's a fair amount.
Your Clairvoyant, the one who said he'd have your back ... he's a no-show.
The site we were supposed to lead him to with our minds ... blown to pieces, buried under 100 feet of rock.
It seems the only psychic power your buddy has shown is the ability to predict if you tell tell a rich, entitled dirtbag he's gonna get away with murder, he'll believe it.
Trip.
Girl's gonna live ... live to testify how a billionaire shot her point-blank in the stomach.
Oh, we got a great little home movie of you admitting that, genius.
This Clairvoyant played you and left you to rot.
- You said there was good news.
- I did?
Oh, yeah.
You still have your tongue.
Let's go.
I want to thank you, Garrett, for letting us keep Quinn on the plane.
Don't mention it.
There's still time for me to make the rest of his life a long, living hell.
I'm counting on it.
- Something I need to ask you, Phil.
- Of course.
- We've known each other a long time.
- Yes, we have.
Been in our share of tight spots together.
If it had gone the other way...
if Skye hadn't survived, were you really prepared to throw Quinn off this plane?
You were the one who made that threat.
I just asked to keep him on the plane for awhile.
You're right.
It was me.
- My mistake.
- Till next time.
Might be sooner than you think.
My man Trip's got eyes for that biotech gal of yours.
Do you mind?
You did the impossible today.
You saved Skye's life.
Why aren't you happy about it?
They told me you were yelling...
to not use the drug, to not use it on Skye.
Why?
What made you change your mind?
Phil?
Phil!
You all right?
Being down there... seeing where I came from...
I just got really scared that she would suffer the way that I did.
But she didn't.
For whatever reason...
she didn't.
"Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D." will return in a moment.
I'm gonna go see if they have a map.
I'll be waiting in the car, Mrs. Mackenzie.
- Are you okay?
- No.
No, I'm parched and weary.
Is all of Midgard so desolate?
Midgard?
I don't know where that is.
- This is Death Valley.
- Oh.
I seek passage from this...
valley of death to a more bountiful land.
I wish I could help,but...
it's built for two.
Y-you should ask the manager inside.
Uh, maybe there's a bus later today.
- She's your bride?
- Yep, since yesterday morning.
And you prefer her to me?
Well... yeah.
I prefer Nicole to pretty much everyone.
That's why I married her ...
together forever.
Loyalty ...
I admire that in a man.
I am going to need your help...
if I am to remain free.
Jimmy!
I swear to protect you and keep you safe, but I don't even know your name.
It's Lorelei.
My name is Lorelei.
## Reyaansh ##
Previously on "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...
WhywouldS.H.I.E.L.D. keep details of your death from you?
What happened in Tahiti?
Director Fury ...
He had a team of scientists working around the clock
- I wanted to die.
- And we should have let you.
Once we capture Quinn, we'll be one step closer to the Clairvoyant.
- Where's Skye?
- Agent Coulson, it's dangerous... sending her in like that, all alone.
Oh.
Oh, god.
Hang on.
- Put her in there!
- Is it working?
!
We need to get her to a medical facility and fast.
1x14
- T.A.H.I.T.I.
She was shot twice in the abdomen at close range almost two hours ago.
She's tachycardic, hypotensive, and lost a significant amount of blood.
We had to lower her core body temp in order to transport her here.
It's probably what kept her alive this long.
We'll do everything we can.
- Oh, dear.
I'm a mess.
- No.
You were great.
Intubate, and let's start getting that shirt off.
Okay, let's prep her for ex-lap.
I'm here.
That's unacceptable.
I need to speak to Director Fury immediately, please.
Why didn't I stop her?
- I could have.
- As if you could stop Skye doing anything she's set her mind to.
I shouldn't have let her go after Quinn by herself.
What was I thinking?
It's not your fault.
She shouldn't have been there.
I'm her S.O. It's on me.
The one to blame is the man who shot her, Ian Quinn.
He's responsible.
Yes, the message is, I have an agent dying, and there are questions only he can answer.
- How is she?
- Not good.
The shots perforated her stomach and penetrated the large and small intestines.
We resected what we could, but...
- there's been too much damage.
- So what's next?
We can keep her comfortable, but you'll need to make a decision on whether or not you want to keep her on life support.
You're saying there's nothing to be done?
I'm saying you need to call her family and get them here as soon as possible.
We're her family.
In that case, I'm very sorry.
Finally.
I was beginning to think you'd forgotten ...
Ohh.
Wait!
You can't!
Why?
'Cause you're defenseless, like she was?
May!
May!
Outside, now.
He deserves to die, not her!
Agreed.
But right now, Quinn doesn't matter ... only Skye does, and I need you to pilot the plane.
You heard what the doctor said.
She said there was nothing more they could do for her, but there are doctors who brought me back from the dead.
If they can do that, I'm betting they can save Skye.
H.Q. radioed in.
They've ordered us to hand over Quinn for interrogation and transport to the fridge.
Do you want me to arrange the transfer?
No.
Quinn stays in our custody until I say otherwise.
Yes, sir.
Are you sure about this, taking her all the way to Bethesda?
It's where my file says I was treated after New York.
I understand, but what makes you think the doctors there will be able to do anything different?
- I know they saved you, but ...
- They did a lot more than save me.
It's time you know the truth.
That can't be.
What you're describing ...
it's medically impossible.
Except for the fact that I'm standing here ... proof that it's not impossible.
And here's more proof ... my file, describing how they brought me back ... the doctors, the procedures, the drugs.
Sir... it's against the law for us to read this.
- Are you sure?
- I don't care about your clearance level.
I'm ordering you to read it.
"Death and recovery report."
It's only recently that director Fury gave me access to this.
I've gone over it dozens of times.
I need you to decipher the medical parts of it
I didn't understand.
Feel free to reach out to Dr. Streiten.
He should be eager to answer any questions you may have.
Yes, I'm sure I'll have quite a few.
- So, what about Tahiti?
- Turns out, not so magical, just false memories implanted to cover up what was done.
Sir... it says here your heart was perforated, torn in half.
That part of it I understood.
And yet, they managed to heal the damaged tissue completely.
We need to understand how.
- So we can do the same for Skye.
- That's what I'm counting on.
- We'll get right on it, sir.
- Thank you.
- Hurt much?
- I'm fine.
Coulson told me how long he was dead.
But you already knew that, didn't you?
I saw Skye... in the pod, machines filtering her blood, breathing for her.
I'm not sure I'd make this play ... fly halfway around the world hoping for a second miracle.
If Coulson thinks there's a chance in a million to save Skye, to save any of us, he'd take it.
People like us ...
we need people like him.
So, yeah, it makes sense ... a lot more sense than the alternative.
- You mean giving up?
- Or killing the man responsible.
I did like seeing you go after Quinn.
You don't open the blinds like that very often.
S.H.I.E.L.D. 616, this is tower Michael Tango.
You are in violation of S.H.I.E.L.D. directive 1297.
- Respond immediately.
- Disobeying a direct order.
We didn't hand Quinn over for interrogation.
Great.
This is S.H.I.E.L.D. 616.
How do we proceed?
Prepare to be boarded and relinquish command.
Really?
All the war and chaos in the world, and S.H.I.E.L.D. sends a plane after us?
Three planes ...
a small transport to dock and a pair of F-35s to make sure we hand over Quinn.
If they scratched my paint, I'm gonna be pissed.
I'll await your orders, sir.
Garrett?
What the hell are you doing here?
Well, as opposed to the level 8 jackass I'm staring at,
- I still follow orders.
- You're the worst at following orders.
Maybe... but I like this one.
You are to immediately turn Ian Quinn over for transport to the fridge.
Agent Antoine Triplett, Agent Phillip Coulson.
You wouldn't know it to look at him, but Phil's one of our finest.
An honor, sir.
Trip joined me as my specialist after Ward came to your circus.
- Go secure the prisoner.
- Yes, sir.
Phil, come on.
Just because Fury gave you this pretty plane doesn't mean they won't shoot it out of the sky.
Why are you really here, Garrett?
S.H.I.E.L.D. could have sent any security team to collect Quinn.
Why you?
- You've been chasing him, too!
- Since Malta.
Then yesterday, your little Italian job cost my team weeks of work.
- You can't have him, not yet.
- This isn't a request.
Quinn shot one of my agents.
She's on life support in a med pod downstairs.
We are taking her to the trauma center in Bethesda.
Quinn actually pulled the trigger?
Skye infiltrated his compound in Malta.
When he saw her yesterday, seems he took it personally.
I never took him for a triggerman.
He pays others for that.
I've lost three of my own chasing him.
Then you understand why I can't give him to you until we save my agent.
Because if she doesn't make it...
- Agent Grant Ward.
- Trip.
- Is Garrett upstairs?
- Yeah.
You know, he still talks about that thousand-yard shot you took in Bandung.
It was 2,000.
So, what are you doing here?
Man, this is like the Playboy jet.
I mean, a guy could get soft bunking in a space like this.
How did Coulson swing such a sweet ride?
- He died.
- That's tight.
You want to point me to the box you're keeping Quinn?
H.Q. ordered Garrett to haul his ass to the fridge for questioning.
- Is that a full bar?
- You're welcome to it.
But, uh, Quinn stays put till Coulson says otherwise.
Come on, man.
Garrett was your S.O., too, so you know how this works.
- Why don't you remind me?
- Garrett wants Quinn.
It's my job to make sure Garrett gets what he wants.
- Now where is he?
- Can't help you with that.
No worries.
I'll find Quinn myself.
I'm sure he's tucked between the jacuzzi and the squash court.
Hey.
Agent Ward, stand down.
Agent Garrett and I have come to an agreement.
He convinced H.Q. he could interrogate Quinn here on our plane as we continue to Bethesda.
Well, I'm a bit of a sweet talker when I need to be.
You wouldn't believe what I could talk this son of a gun into.
- Good seeing you, son.
- You, too, sir.
And thank you.
Saving the girl's top priority, and she might know something.
I've never heard of half the drugs they gave Coulson ...
GH-325?
And what about this robotic-assisted- neural-micro-surgery they used to implant the Tahiti memories?
- It all sounds so diabolical.
- I agree.
We can't argue with the results.
He's walking around.
Yeah but at what cost?
You read the transcripts.
He begged the doctors to let him die.
This is different.
Skye's still alive.
We have to keep her that way.
Oh.
I've asked Dr. Streiten to advise us.
Hello.
Yes.
Are you sure?
That can't be.
And here I thought I was gonna get to play bad cop.
Ian Quinn, this is Agent Garrett.
- He's here to ask you some questions.
- Oh, no, thank you.
I ... my head's still ringing from the last visitor.
At least the last visitor left you with a head.
I'm not always that considerate.
I'm interested in one of your newer projects.
Hmm?
Oh, but there are so many to choose from.
Let me be clear ... you have no rights.
You have no lawyer.
The only thing keeping Agent Coulson here from throwing you out of this plane is the very weak heartbeat of a young agent downstairs, and the only incentive I have for not tearing your tongue out is that you use it to answer my questions.
Is that clear?
Mm-hmm.
- You understand that?
- No.
Tell us about Cybertek and the Deathlok program.
- Deathlok?
- Catchy, right?
Sounds like some wrestler from the '80s.
What is it really?
Those are dangerous waters, and the last agent that waded into them wound up with two in the stomach.
So... she's still alive?
Yeah.
And you better hope she stays that way.
Is that why you shot Skye, because she saw what Cybertek delivered?
No.
I shot Skye because that's what the Clairvoyant told me to do.
You wanted to see me?
I just got off the phone with the trauma center in Bethesda.
Dr. Streiten's gone off the grid.
So we'll find a different doctor there who operated on Coulson.
- That's the thing.
Actually...
- Coulson was never treated there.
- You're not making sense.
- None of this makes sense.
The doctors listed, the operating-room number ... none of them exist.
None of them are part of S.H.I.E.L.D.
What I find surprising is how a big-shot billionaire could fall for this psychic mumbo jumbo.
Oh, I doubted it at the beginning, but then I realized it would be mutually beneficial.
He must have something pretty terrible on you.
Shooting an unarmed girl?
Let's just say I learned the hard way that obeying was in my best interest.
Yet... here you are.
Let me assure you it wasn't luck that led me to your partner's black sedan in Berlin or that he'd open the door for a redhead or those two agents in Morocco.
Do you think it was just a roll of the dice that my people found them in that Riad?
No, it was the Clairvoyant.
Your Clairvoyant say anything about me knocking your teeth in?
The Clairvoyant sees everything except what happened to him.
This is still about me.
Wait.
You're gonna need to rewind the tape, Phil.
You heard about my near-death before the battle of New York?
There's more to it than that.
I thought I was gone for seconds ...
- turns out it was days.
- That's impossible.
Which is why the Clairvoyant will do anything to know how it happened.
- Even order you to shoot Skye.
- Wait.
You don't know what S.H.I.E.L.D. did to save you.
That's why we're flying to where I was treated.
So shooting the girl forces you to figure it all out.
- So the Clairvoyant can finally see.
- Or you let the girl die.
Quinn shot Skye for nothing.
The place we were going, the doctors who treated you ...
- they don't exist.
- Or maybe they exist somewhere else.
This is S.H.I.E.L.D. There are always secrets.
That's my fear, sir.
Your file is filled with secrets ... experimental drugs, unknown surgical procedures we've never even heard of.
Frankly, Fitz and I only understand about 70% of what's in here.
Even if we do find where they treated you and we were able to replicate the procedure, there's the other obvious question.
- Which is?
- Whether we should.
What you experienced, sir, if this file is even partially accurate ...
No one's suggesting that we submit Skye to everything that I went through, but if there's something in here ... a drug, a treatment that can save her, we need to find it.
- Figure it out.
- Yes, sir.
- You disagree.
- No.
I think we need to do everything humanly possible to save Skye.
But we need to acknowledge that doing so might give the Clairvoyant exactly what he wants.
It's a risk we have to take.
How is she?
Deteriorating, and I don't know how to stop it.
The only thing I've found remotely interesting
- is something called "GH-325."
- Some kind of drug?
Agent Coulson was injected with that, and literally minutes later, his wounds showed signs of cellular regeneration.
Regeneration?
Is that even possible?
Even if this miracle drug does exist, we don't know where to find it.
We have no coordinates, no logs of anyone's departure or arrival.
I think maybe I can help with that.
- You've set up the echo-chamber.
- Yeah, I made a couple of calls.
A buddy of mine works in the archives at the Triskelion.
Agreed to let us access it from here.
Hard to believe, but this cube contains all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s historical administrative data.
Yeah, but if Agent Coulson's operation didn't take place at a S.H.I.E.L.D. medical facility ...
We won't find any record of it here ...
I know.
But this also contains all interoffice memos, travel arrangements, purchase orders.
Maybe we can track down the location through a virtual paper trail of some sort or another.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, let's start with the travel memoranda from the date Coulson got stabbed.
Here we go.
Or, um, what about Dr. Streiten's departure from the Triskelion?
- Maybe they have that.
- Yeah.
- Here.
This is interesting.
- A World War II bunker?
"Collapsed" bunker.
Definitely not a sanctioned S.H.I.E.L.D. facility.
- "The Guest House"?
- Exactly.
Guest House ...
G.H. GH-325.
Look at the file's access history.
- The only record of it being opened...
- Is by a level 10 operative.
Director Fury.
So, Fury's been to this place, and he's the person who sanctioned the operations on Agent Coulson.
And why aren't you trying to find the file?
Ah, damn.
Encrypted.
Skye could crack this.
What would she do?
It's not an encryption.
The Guest House is not a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility.
We don't know who or what's in there.
- Be prepared for potential resistance.
- No contact from inside?
I've tried every known channel ... no response.
- Place could be abandoned.
- Let's hope not.
We need the people inside to work on Skye.
Simmons is prepping Skye to move at a moment's notice, sir.
Trip can help.
He's had med-tech training.
Good.
We do our jobs right, this will all go peacefully.
- What if they don't want to help us?
- I'll say "pretty please."
We need the doctors alive and the place intact.
If it does go sideways, Fitz, I need you down there to determine what Simmons can use to help Skye.
And then we take it.
Let's move.
Company?
Nothing's scheduled for a couple weeks.
Try the protocol.
How was the drive from Istanbul?
- Countersign?
- No clue.
- Never heard it.
- I can't find it in any of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s protocol directives.
This is Agent Coulson with S.H.I.E.L.D.
We don't know the counter, but we have a team member in dire need of medical assistance.
We know she can be treated here.
Open the doors.
Maybe we can work something out.
Do you copy?
How was the drive from Istanbul?
We're looking for medical assistance.
A person's life is at stake.
Will you help us?
How was the drive from Istanbul?
"Pretty please" it is.
These guys are good...
hacked their way in.
How the hell did they find this place?
Doesn't matter.
Didn't know the countersign.
- You want left or right?
- Left's good.
There's an antechamber and a set of glass doors.
Can't see much beyond that.
Lights are all out.
Well, they know we're coming.
Let's go say "hello."
Clear.
Okay, Simmons, we're going in now.
Simmons?
Damn it.
Comms are down.
There's too much mountain on top of us.
Trust me ... it's better.
You don't want them hearing the horrible death we're walking into.
Humor, son.
You Brits are too serious.
- Besides, if the job was easy...
- It wouldn't be any fun.
I'm not afraid ... not yet.
I suspect the real danger won't happen until we breach that bulletproof glass.
Probably a stairwell back to the surface.
What do you think, Fitz?
Can you get us inside?
To certain, horrible death?
Absolutely.
Okay, sir, just say the word.
Once we get inside, everybody find cover.
All right, gentlemen, here we go.
We've come for medical assistance.
But you continue firing on us, we will defend oursel...
- I count two hostiles.
- Copy that.
Ready?
You got one of those little flash things?
Yeah.
Ward!
Clear!
- See if you can get some lights on.
- Yeah.
No hard feelings, Bob.
Clear.
We're not done.
This one's hit.
Shouldn't be too hard to find.
Go.
We're gonna get you medical help.
Is anyone else down here?
Where are the doctors?
Med staff doesn't stay here.
We're looking for a drug ...
GH-325.
It might help you, too.
- Do I... k-know you?
- I don't know.
I-I might have spent some time here awhile back.
Then you know about... the timer.
We got a problem!
Semtex.
The whole place is rigged to blow.
There's enough explosive to bring down the whole mountain on top of us.
Sir.
Less than 10 minutes.
It's probably a failsafe.
If the guards had eliminated us, they'd stop the timer.
Since they didn't...
It's some kind of emergency override.
Skye could probably get past it, but I can't hack the panel, which means we're trapped in here.
You're the guy who taught Ward how to disarm nuclear bombs.
Figure out a way to get us out of here.
Let's go find the drug.
So this is some sort of medical facility.
Yeah, but if nobody's here, I'm not sure it's gonna do us any good.
Tough when it's your team.
You guys go back a ways?
Not really.
A few months.
We have nothing in common ...
couldn't be more different.
But you can't imagine your life without her.
Yes.
You've experienced that, Agent Triplett?
I have.
Sometimes, a person takes you by surprise.
Yeah.
She's very lucky to have you.
I know anything bad ever happens to me, hope you're in my corner, too.
Comms are down.
If I don't hear anything within the hour, I'm going after them.
Skye's coding.
Both of you, now.
How can we help?
I need a unit of Epi.
Got it.
Don't.
Let me die.
Please.
Let me die!
- Is that where...
- Yeah.
The timer doesn't control the explosion.
It's just a clock.
Detonator must be somewhere else.
It's not in here, or I'd have found it.
There's no time to search the whole compound.
Maybe we can take some semtex, use it on the doors.
Sir, are you sure you want to?
We should put suits on before we go in there.
You're right, but there's no time.
I wish I could speak to Simmons.
She'd know what most of this stuff is ... or, at least, what stuff not to touch.
Uh...
Fitz.
Oh.
I don't see any G.H...
Agent Coulson.
It's locked.
Here.
Put these on.
Got it.
Time to go.
We couldn't stop it.
Four minutes and counting.
Almost there.
There's semtex throughout here, as well.
This is it ... 325.
- This is the one we want.
- We gotta go.
- Get it up to Simmons.
- Yeah.
Sir.
I'll be right behind you.
Go.
Three minutes.
Have you worked much with munitions, Agent Fitz?
Explosives are a fascinating specialty ... very exacting.
Too big a concussion could trigger a chain reaction ... bury us like fossils for a thousand years.
Guess we don't have to worry about the Clairvoyant finding this place.
Agent Ward...
would you do the honors?
Thought you'd never ask.
Can you slip through?
- Yeah.
- Go.
All right.
Get that drug up there.
- Coulson.
- Where the hell is he?
Phil!
Go with Fitz.
Make sure that drug gets to the girl.
- Agent Garrett.
- Go!
Save the girl.
Weak, erratic heart rate.
Each time we save her, I ask myself, "is this what Skye would want?"
We didn't come this far to quit.
Getoff...
the ground immediately.
They're alive.
Maybe we can ...
Fitz, come in.
What's your status?
Phil!
Phil, what the hell?
Clock's not slowing down.
- It's about to get really warm in here.
- Hey, you with me?
The guys are out already.
They took the drug up to Skye.
No, don't give it to her.
The drug ... they can't give it to her!
All right.
You can tell them yourself.
Right now, we just need to get out of this mountain and off the ground.
Now let's go.
You want more epinephrine?
- We found it.
- What is it?
And how much, injected where?
May, get us off the ground, or it'll fall out from under us.
No!
Don't give it to her!
I was losing her, anyway.
What harm can it do?
Come on, girl.
It's working.
She'sspiking.
Stop it.
How can we stop it?
Skye!
- What's happening?
- I don't know...
Skye!
Do something ...
we have to do something!
Her heartbeat ... she's stabilizing.
Simmons?
Could someone tell me what we just saw?
The girl's a fighter.
What was that stuff you just gave her?
I don't know.
All I know is that it worked.
You're a real miracle worker.
You did it.
Something happen down there?
I'm not sure.
One minute, he was fine.
The next, it was like he had seen a ghost.
I have good news and bad news.
Which would you like to hear first?
Bad news, then ...
there's a fair amount.
Your Clairvoyant, the one who said he'd have your back ... he's a no-show.
The site we were supposed to lead him to with our minds ... blown to pieces, buried under 100 feet of rock.
It seems the only psychic power your buddy has shown is the ability to predict if you tell tell a rich, entitled dirtbag he's gonna get away with murder, he'll believe it.
Trip.
Girl's gonna live ... live to testify how a billionaire shot her point-blank in the stomach.
Oh, we got a great little home movie of you admitting that, genius.
This Clairvoyant played you and left you to rot.
- You said there was good news.
- I did?
Oh, yeah.
You still have your tongue.
Let's go.
I want to thank you, Garrett, for letting us keep Quinn on the plane.
Don't mention it.
There's still time for me to make the rest of his life a long, living hell.
I'm counting on it.
- Something I need to ask you, Phil.
- Of course.
- We've known each other a long time.
- Yes, we have.
Been in our share of tight spots together.
If it had gone the other way...
if Skye hadn't survived, were you really prepared to throw Quinn off this plane?
You were the one who made that threat.
I just asked to keep him on the plane for awhile.
You're right.
It was me.
- My mistake.
- Till next time.
Might be sooner than you think.
My man Trip's got eyes for that biotech gal of yours.
Do you mind?
You did the impossible today.
You saved Skye's life.
Why aren't you happy about it?
They told me you were yelling...
to not use the drug, to not use it on Skye.
Why?
What made you change your mind?
Phil?
Phil!
You all right?
Being down there... seeing where I came from...
I just got really scared that she would suffer the way that I did.
But she didn't.
For whatever reason...
she didn't.
"Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D." will return in a moment.
I'm gonna go see if they have a map.
I'll be waiting in the car, Mrs. Mackenzie.
- Are you okay?
- No.
No, I'm parched and weary.
Is all of Midgard so desolate?
Midgard?
I don't know where that is.
- This is Death Valley.
- Oh.
I seek passage from this...
valley of death to a more bountiful land.
I wish I could help,but...
it's built for two.
Y-you should ask the manager inside.
Uh, maybe there's a bus later today.
- She's your bride?
- Yep, since yesterday morning.
And you prefer her to me?
Well... yeah.
I prefer Nicole to pretty much everyone.
That's why I married her ...
together forever.
Loyalty ...
I admire that in a man.
I am going to need your help...
if I am to remain free.
Jimmy!
I swear to protect you and keep you safe, but I don't even know your name.
It's Lorelei.
My name is Lorelei.
COULSON:
Previously on Marvel's Agents of S.H.I. E.L. D...
RAINA:
Why would S.H.I.E.L.D. Keep details of your death from you?
Ripped By mstoll
What happened in Tahiti?
DR. STREITEN:
Director Fury.
He had a team of scientists working around the clock.
- I wanted to die.
- And we should have let you.
COULSON:
Once we capture Quinn, we'll be on step closer to The Clairvoyant.
- Where's Skye?
- Agent Coulson, it's dangerous sending her in like that, all alone.
(GUNSHOT)
(GROANS)
Oh, God.
Hang on.
SIMMONS:
Put her in there.
COULSON:
Is it working?
SIMMONS:
We need to get her to a medical facility, and fast.
She was shot twice in the abdomen at close range almost two hours ago.
She's tachycardic, hypotensive, and lost a significant amount of blood.
We had to lower her core body temp in order to transport her here.
That's probably what kept her alive this long.
We'll do everything we can.
Oh, dear, I'm a mess.
No, you were great.
Intubate and let's start getting that shirt off.
- Here.
- (MONITOR BEEPING)
Good, block it off.
- We need two liters standing by.
- Good.
100 cc's.
- It's ready.
- Okay, let's prep her for ex-lap.
It's in.
- Fluids wide open.
- All set.
Patient is ready, Doctor.
I'm here.
That's unacceptable.
I need to speak to Director Fury immediately, please.
Why didn't I stop her?
I could've.
As if you could stop Skye doing anything she set her mind to.
I shouldn't have let her go after Quinn by herself.
- What was I thinking?
- It's not your fault.
She shouldn't have been there.
I'm her S.O. It's on me.
The one to blame is the man who shot her.
Lan Quinn.
He's responsible.
COULSON:
Yes, the message is I have an agent dying and there are questions only he can answer.
(SIGHS)
(WOMAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER P.A.)
- How is she?
- Not good.
The shots perforated her stomach and penetrated the large and small intestines.
We resected what we could, but there's been too much damage.
- So what's next?
- We can keep her comfortable, but you'll need to make a decision on whether or not you wanna keep her on life-support.
You're saying there's nothing to be done?
I'm saying you need to call her family.
Get them here as soon as possible.
We're her family.
In that case, I'm very sorry.
Finally.
I was beginning to think...
- (GRUNTING)
- Oh!
Wait!
You can't!
Why?
Because you're defenseless?
Like she was?
May!
- (PANTING) - (GASPING)
Outside.
Now.
He deserves to die.
Not her.
Agreed.
But right now, Quinn doesn't matter.
Only Skye does and I need you to pilot the plane.
You heard what the doctor said.
She said there was nothing more they could do for her.
But there are doctors who brought me back from the dead.
If they can do that, I'm betting they can save Skye.
H.Q. Radioed in.
They've ordered us to hand over Quinn for interrogation and transport to the Fridge.
You want me to arrange the transfer?
No.
Quinn stays in our custody until I say otherwise.
Yes, sir.
You sure about this?
Taking her all the way to Bethesda?
It's where my file says I was treated after New York.
I understand, but what makes you think the doctors there will be able to do anything different?
I know they saved you...
They did a lot more than save me.
It's time you know the truth.
That can't be.
What you're describing...
It's medically impossible.
Except for the fact that I'm standing here.
Proof that it's not impossible.
And here's more proof.
My file.
Describing how they brought me back.
The doctors, the procedures, the drugs.
Sir, it's against the law for us to read this.
Are you sure...
I don't care about your clearance level.
I'm ordering you to read it.
"Death and Recovery Report."
It's only recently that Director Fury gave me access to this.
I've gone over it dozens of times.
I need you to decipher the medical parts of it I didn't understand.
Feel free to reach out to Dr. Streiten.
He should be eager to answer any questions you may have.
Yes, I'm sure I'll have quite a few.
So, what about Tahiti?
Turns out, not so magical.
Just false memories, implanted to cover up what was done.
Sir, it says here your heart was perforated.
Torn in half.
That part of it, I understood.
And yet they managed to heal the damaged tissue completely.
We need to understand how.
So we can do the same for Skye.
That's what I'm counting on.
- We'll get right on it, sir.
- Thank you.
(SIGHS)
Hurt much?
I'm fine.
Coulson told me how long he was dead.
You already knew that, didn't you?
I saw Skye in the pod.
Machines filtering her blood, breathing for her.
I'm not sure I'd make this play.
Fly halfway around the world hoping for a second miracle.
If Coulson thinks there's a chance in a million to save Skye, to save any of us, he'd take it.
People like us, we need people like him.
So, yeah, it makes sense.
A lot more sense than the alternative.
You mean giving up?
Killing the man responsible.
I did like seeing you go after Quinn.
You don't open the blinds like that very often.
WOMAN:
S.H.I.E.L.D. 616, this is Tower Michael Tango.
You are in violation of S.H.I.E.L.D. Directive 1297.
Respond immediately.
Disobeying a direct order.
We didn't hand Quinn over for interrogation.
Great.
This is S.H.I. E.L.D. 616.
How do we proceed?
WOMAN:
Prepare to be boarded and relinquish command.
Really?
All the war and chaos in the world and S.H.I. E.L.D. Sends a plane after us?
Three planes.
A small transport to dock and a pair of F-35s to make sure we hand over Quinn.
(LOUD THUD)
They scratch my paint, I'm gonna be pissed.
I'll await your orders, sir.
Garrett?
What the hell are you doing here?
Well, as opposed to the Level eight jackass I'm staring at,
I still follow orders.
You're the worst at following orders.
Maybe, but I like this one.
You are to immediately turn lan Quinn over for transport to the Fridge.
Agent Antoine Triplett, Agent Philip Coulson.
You wouldn't know it to look at him, but Phil's one of our finest.
An honor, sir.
Trip joined me as my specialist after Ward came to your circus.
- Go secure the prisoner.
- Yes, sir.
Phil, come on.
Just because Fury gave you this pretty plane, doesn't mean they won't shoot it out of the sky.
Why are you really here, Garrett?
S.H.I. E.L. D could've sent any security team to collect Quinn.
Why you?
You've been chasing him, too?
Since Malta.
Then yesterday, your little Italian job cost my team weeks of work.
You can't have him.
Not yet.
This isn't a request.
Quinn shot one of my agents.
She's on life-support in a med pod downstairs.
We're taking her to the trauma center in Bethesda.
Quinn actually pulled the trigger?
Skye infiltrated his compound in Malta.
When he saw her yesterday, it seems he took it personally.
I never took him for a triggerman.
He pays others for that.
I've lost three of my own chasing him.
Then you understand why I can't give him to you until we save my agent?
Because if she doesn't make it...
Agent Grant Ward.
- Trip.
- (CHUCKLES)
- Is Garrett upstairs?
- Yeah.
You know, he still talks about that 1,000-yard shot you took in Bandung.
It was 2,000.
So what are you doing here?
Man, this is like the Playboy jet.
- Mmm-hmm.
- (CHUCKLES)
I mean, a guy could get soft bunking in a space like this.
How did Coulson swing such a sweet ride?
- He died.
- That's tight.
You want to point me to the box you're keeping Quinn?
H.Q. Ordered Garrett to haul his ass to the Fridge for questioning.
Is that a full bar?
You're welcome to it.
But Quinn stays put till Coulson says otherwise.
Come on, man.
Garrett was your S.O., too, so you know how this works.
Why don't you remind me?
Garrett wants Quinn.
It's my job to make sure Garrett gets what he wants.
- Now where is he?
- Can't help you with that.
No worries.
I'll find Quinn myself.
I'm sure he's tucked between the Jacuzzi and the squash court.
Hey... (BOTH GRUNTING)
Agent Ward, stand down!
(COUGHING)
Agent Garrett and I have come to an agreement.
He convinced H.Q. He could interrogate Quinn here on our plane as we continue to Bethesda.
Well, I'm a bit of a sweet talker when I need to be.
You wouldn't believe what I could talk this son-of-a-gun into.
- Good seeing you, son.
- You, too, sir.
And thank you.
Saving the girl's top priority.
And she might know something.
I never heard of half the drugs they gave Coulson.
GH-325?
And what about this robotic-assisted neural microsurgery they used to implant the Tahiti memories?
It all sounds so diabolical.
I agree.
We can't argue with the results.
He's walking around.
Yeah.
But at what cost?
You read the transcripts.
He begged the doctors to let him die.
This is different.
Skye's still alive.
We have to keep her that way.
- (CELL PHONE BUZZING)
- Oh.
I've asked Dr. Streiten to advise us.
Hello.
Yes.
Are you sure?
That can't be.
- (DOOR OPENS) - (GASPS)
And here I thought I was gonna get to play bad cop.
Lan Quinn, this is Agent Garrett.
He's here to ask you some questions.
No thank you.
My head's still ringing from the last visitor.
At least the last visitor left you with a head.
I'm not always that considerate.
I'm interested in one of your newer projects.
Hmm?
Oh, but there's so many to choose from. (GRUNTS)
GARRETT:
Let me be clear.
You have no rights.
You have no lawyer.
The only thing keeping Agent Coulson here from throwing you out of this plane is the very weak heartbeat of a young agent downstairs.
And the only incentive I have for not tearing your tongue out is that you use it to answer my questions.
- Is that clear?
- (MUFFLED) Mmm-hmm.
- You understand that?
- No.
(GROANING)
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
Tell us about Cybertek and the Deathlok Program.
- Deathlok?
- Catchy, right?
Sounds like some wrestler from the '80s.
What is it really?
Those are dangerous waters.
And the last agent that waded into them wound up with two in the stomach.
(GRUNTING)
So, she's still alive?
Yeah.
And you better hope she stays that way.
Is that why you shot Skye?
Because she saw what Cybertek delivered?
No.
I shot Skye because that's what The Clairvoyant told me to do.
You wanted to see me?
I just got off the phone with the trauma center in Bethesda.
Dr. Streiten's gone off the grid.
So we'll find a different doctor there who operated on Coulson.
- That's the thing, actually.
- Coulson was never treated there.
- You're not making sense.
- None of this makes sense.
The doctors listed, the operating room number, none of them exist.
None of them are part of S.H.I. E.L.D.
What I find surprising is how a big-shot billionaire could fall for this psychic mumbo jumbo.
Oh, I doubted it at the beginning.
But then I realized it would be mutually beneficial.
He must have something pretty terrible on you.
Shooting an unarmed girl?
Let's just say, I learned the hard way that obeying was in my best interest.
Yet here you are.
Let me assure you, it wasn't luck that led me to your partner's black sedan in Berlin.
Or that he'd open the door for a redhead.
Or those two agents in Morocco.
Did you think it was just a roll of the dice that my people found them in that riad?
No.
It was The Clairvoyant.
Your Clairvoyant say anything about me knocking your teeth in?
The Clairvoyant sees everything.
Except what happened to him.
This is still about me?
Wait.
You're gonna need to rewind the tape, Phil.
You heard about my near-death before the Battle of New York?
There's more to it than that.
I thought I was gone for seconds.
Turns out, it was days.
That's impossible.
Which is why The Clairvoyant will do anything to know how it happened.
Even order you to shoot Skye.
Wait.
You don't know what S.H.I. E.L.D. Did to save you.
That's why we're flying to where I was treated.
So, shooting the girl forces you to either figure it all out...
So The Clairvoyant can finally see.
Or you let the girl die.
Quinn shot Skye for nothing.
The place where we're going, the doctors who treated you, they don't exist.
Or maybe they exist somewhere else.
This is S.H.I. E.L.D. There are always secrets.
That's my fear, sir.
Your file is filled with secrets.
Experimental drugs, unknown surgical procedures we've never even heard of.
Frankly, Fitz and I only understand about 70% of what's in here.
Even if we do find where they treated you, and we were able to replicate the procedure, there's the other obvious question.
- Which is?
- Whether we should.
What you experienced, sir, if this file is even partially accurate...
No one's suggesting that we submit Skye to everything that I went through.
But if there's something in here, a drug, a treatment that can save her, we need to find it.
- Figure it out.
- Yes, sir.
- You disagree?
- No.
I think we need to do everything humanly possible to save Skye.
But we need to acknowledge that doing so might give The Clairvoyant exactly what he wants.
It's a risk we have to take.
(SIGHS)
(MONITOR BEEPING)
How is she?
Deteriorating.
And I don't know how to stop it.
The only thing I found remotely interesting is something called GH-325.
Some kind of drug?
Agent Coulson was injected with it and literally minutes later, his wounds showed signs of cellular regeneration.
Regeneration?
Is that even possible?
Even if this miracle drug does exist, we don't know where to find it.
We have no coordinates, no logs of anyone's departure or arrival...
I think maybe I can help with that.
You set up the echo chamber.
Yeah, I made a couple of calls.
A buddy of mine works in the archives at the Triskelion.
Agreed to let us access it from here.
Hard to believe but this cube contains all of S.H.I. E.L.D.'s historical administrative data.
But if Agent Coulson's operation didn't take place at a S.H.I. E.L.D. Medical facility...
We won't find any record of it in here, I know.
But this also contains all inter-office memos, travel arrangements, purchase orders.
Maybe we can track down the location through a virtual paper trail of some sort or another.
Yeah.
(BEEPING)
(SIGHS) Okay.
Well, let's start with the travel memoranda from the date Coulson got stabbed.
Okay.
Or, what about Dr. Streiten's departure from the Triskelion?
- Maybe they have that.
- Yeah.
Ready?
(EKG BEEPING)
FITZ:
Here.
This is interesting.
A World War II bunker?
Collapsed bunker.
Definitely not a sanctioned S.H.I. E.L.D. Facility.
"The Guest House?"
Exactly.
Guest House.
G-H.
GH-325.
Look at the file's access history.
The only record of it being opened...
Is by a Level 10 operative.
BOTH:
Director Fury.
So Fury's been to this place, and he's the person who sanctioned the operations on Agent Coulson, and why aren't you trying to find the file?
(BEEPING)
Damn.
Encrypted.
Skye could crack this.
What would she do?
It's not an encryption.
The Guest House is not a S.H.I. E.L.D. Facility.
We don't know who or what's in there.
Be prepared for potential resistance.
No contact from inside?
I've tried every known channel.
No response.
- Place could be abandoned.
- Let's hope not.
We need the people inside to work on Skye.
Simmons is prepping Skye to move at a moment's notice, sir.
Trip can help.
He's had med-tech training.
Good.
We do our jobs right, this will all go peacefully.
What if they don't wanna help us?
I'll say, "Pretty please."
We need the doctors alive and the place intact.
If it does go sideways, Fitz, I need you down there to determine what Simmons can use to help Skye.
And then we take it.
Let's move.
(TONE PLAYS)
ALPHA:
Company.
Nothing's scheduled for a couple weeks.
Try the protocol.
How was the drive from Istanbul?
Countersign?
- No clue.
- Never heard it.
I can't find it in any of S.H.I. E.L.D.'s protocol directives.
This is Agent Coulson with S.H.I. E.L.D.
We don't know the counter but we have a team member in dire need of medical assistance.
We know she can be treated here.
Open the doors, maybe we can work something out.
Do you copy?
How was the drive from Istanbul?
We're looking for medical assistance.
A person's life is at stake.
Will you help us?
How was the drive from Istanbul?
"Pretty please," it is.
These guys are good.
Hacked their way in.
- How the hell did they find this place?
- Doesn't matter.
Didn't know the countersign.
- You want left or right?
- Left's good.
(ELEVATOR BELL DINGS)
FITZ:
There's an antechamber and a set of glass doors.
Can't see much beyond that.
Lights are all out.
Well, they know we're coming.
Let's go say hello.
Clear!
Okay, Simmons, we're going in now.
Simmons.
Damn it.
Comms are down.
There's too much mountain on top of us.
Trust me, it's better.
You don't want them hearing the horrible death we're walking into.
Humor, son.
You Brits are too serious.
Besides, if the job was easy...
It wouldn't be any fun.
I'm not afraid.
Not yet.
I suspect the real danger won't happen until we breach that bulletproof glass.
Probably a stairwell back to the surface.
What do you think, Fitz?
Can you get us inside?
To certain, horrible death?
Absolutely.
Okay, sir, just say the word.
Once we get inside, everybody find cover.
All right, gentlemen, here we go.
(BEEPS)
We've come for medical assistance, but if you continue firing on us, we will defend...
I count two hostiles.
Copy that.
Ready?
- You got one of those little flash things?
- Yeah.
(BEEPING)
Ward.
(GRUNTS)
Clear!
- See if you can get some lights on.
- Yeah.
(SIGHS) No hard feelings, Bob.
Clear.
We're not done.
This one's hit.
Shouldn't be too hard to find.
COULSON:
Go.
(GROANING)
We're gonna get you medical help.
Is anyone else down here?
Where are the doctors?
Med staff doesn't stay here.
We're looking for a drug.
GH-325.
It might help you, too.
Do I know you?
I don't know.
I might've spent some time here a while back.
Then you know about the timer.
GARRETT:
We got a problem!
Semtex.
The whole place is rigged to blow.
There's enough explosive to bring down the whole mountain on top of us.
Sir, less than 10 minutes.
It's probably a fail-safe.
If the guards had eliminated us, they'd stop the timer.
Since they didn't...
FITZ:
There's some kind of emergency override.
Skye could probably get past it, but I can't hack the panel, which means we're trapped in here.
You're the guy who taught Ward how to disarm nuclear bombs.
Figure out a way to get us out of here.
Let's go find the drug.
So, this is some sort of medical facility?
Yeah, but if nobody's here, I'm not sure it'll do us any good.
- (MONITOR BEEPING)
- Tough when it's your team.
You guys go back a ways?
Not really.
A few months.
We have nothing in common.
Couldn't be more different.
But you can't imagine your life without her?
Yes.
You've experienced that, Agent Triplett?
I have.
Sometimes a person takes you by surprise.
Yeah.
She's very lucky to have you.
I know if anything bad ever happens to me,
I hope you're in my corner, too.
MAY:
Comms are down.
If I don't hear anything within the hour, I'm going after them.
(RAPID BEEPING)
- Skye's coding.
Both of you, now.
- (FLATLINING)
How can we help?
- I need a unit of epi.
- Got it.
COULSON:
Let me die!
Don't.
Let me die, please.
Let me die!
- Is that where...
- Yeah.
Timer doesn't control the explosion.
It's just a clock.
Detonator must be somewhere else.
It's not in here, I'd have found it.
There's no time to search the whole compound.
Maybe we can take some Semtex, use it on the doors.
Sir, are you sure you wanna...
We should put suits on before we go in there.
You're right.
But there's no time.
Wish I could speak to Simmons.
She'd know what most of this stuff is.
Or at least which stuff not to touch.
Fitz.
Oh.
I don't see any GH.
Agent Coulson.
It's locked.
Here.
Put these on.
Got it.
Time to go.
We couldn't stop it.
Four minutes and counting.
FITZ:
Almost there.
Semtex throughout here as well.
This is it. 325.
This is the one we want.
We gotta go.
Get it up to Simmons.
Yeah.
Sir.
I'll be right behind you.
Go.
Three minutes.
Have you worked much with munitions, Agent Fitz?
Explosives are a fascinating specialty.
Very exacting.
Too big a concussion can trigger a chain reaction, bury us like fossils for 1,000 years.
Guess we don't have to worry about The Clairvoyant finding this place.
Agent Ward, you do the honors.
WARD:
Thought you'd never ask.
(GUN COCKS)
- Can you slip through?
- Yeah.
Go.
Get that drug up there.
- Coulson.
- Where the hell is he?
Phil!
Go with Fitz.
Make sure that drug gets to the girl.
Agent Garrett...
Go!
Save the girl.
- SIMMONS:
Weak, erratic heart rate.
- (MONITOR BEEPING)
Each time we save her, I ask myself,
"Is this what Skye would want?"
We didn't come this far to quit.
FITZ:
Get off the ground immediately.
- They're alive.
Maybe we can...
- (FLATLINING)
- (SIMMONS PANTING)
- Fitz, come in.
What's your status?
GARRETT:
Phil.
Phil, what the hell?
Clock's not slowing down.
It's about to get really warm in here.
Hey.
You with me?
The guys are out already.
They took the drug up to Skye.
No.
Don't give it to her.
The drug!
They can't give it to her!
All right.
You tell her yourself.
Right now we just need to get out of this mountain and off the ground.
Now, let's go!
We found it.
What is it?
And how much?
Injected where?
May, get us off the ground or it'll fall out from under us.
(WHIRRING)
No!
Don't give it to her!
(CONTINUES FLATLINING)
I was losing her anyway.
What harm can it do?
(MONITOR BEEPING)
Come on, girl.
GARRETT:
It's working.
(GASPING)
- (RAPID BEEPING)
- SIMMONS:
She's spiking!
WARD:
Stop it!
How can we stop it?
Skye!
- What's happening?
- I don't know.
COULSON:
Skye!
FITZ:
Do something!
We have to do something!
(GASPING)
(BEEPING SLOWS)
SIMMONS:
Her heartbeat.
She's stabilizing.
Simmons?
Can someone tell me what we just saw?
Girl's a fighter.
What was that stuff you just gave her?
I don't know.
All I know is that it worked.
TRIPLETT:
You're a real miracle worker.
You did it.
Something happen down there?
I'm not sure.
One minute he was fine, the next it was like he'd seen a ghost.
I have good news and bad news.
Which would you like to hear first?
Bad news then.
There's a fair amount.
Your Clairvoyant, the one who said he'd have your back?
He's a no-show.
The site we were supposed to lead him to with our minds?
Blown to pieces, buried under 100 feet of rock.
Seems the only psychic power your buddy has shown is the ability to predict if you tell a rich, entitled dirtbag he's gonna get away with murder, he'll believe it.
Trip.
Girl's gonna live.
Live to testify how a billionaire shot her point blank in the stomach.
Oh, we got a great little home movie of you admitting that, genius.
This Clairvoyant played you and left you to rot.
You said there was good news.
I did?
Oh, yeah.
You still have your tongue.
Let's go.
I wanna thank you, Garrett, for letting us keep Quinn on the plane.
Don't mention it.
There's still time for me to make the rest of his life a long living hell.
I'm counting on it.
- Something I need to ask you, Phil.
- Of course.
We've known each other a long time.
Yes, we have.
Been in our share of tight spots together.
If it had gone the other way.
If Skye hadn't survived, were you really prepared to throw Quinn off this plane?
You were the one who made that threat.
I just asked to keep him on the plane for a while.
You're right.
It was me.
My mistake.
Until next time.
Might be sooner than you think.
My man Trip's got eyes for that biotech gal of yours.
Do you mind?
You did the impossible today.
You saved Skye's life.
Why aren't you happy about it?
(SIGHS)
They told me you were yelling to not use the drug.
To not use it on Skye.
Why?
What made you change your mind?
MAY:
Phil?
Phil, you all right?
Being down there, seeing where I came from,
I just got really scared that she would suffer the way that I did.
But she didn't.
For whatever reason, she didn't.
NICOLE:
I'm gonna go see if they have a map.
I'll be waiting in the car, Mrs. MacKenzie.
(CHUCKLES)
(PANTING)
- Are you okay?
- (SIGHS) No.
No, I'm parched and weary.
Is all of Midgard so desolate?
Midgard?
I don't know where that is.
This is Death Valley.
Oh.
I seek passage from this valley of death to a more bountiful land.
I wish I could help, but...
It's built for two.
You should ask the manager inside.
Maybe there's a bus later today.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATION)
She's your bride?
Yep.
Since yesterday morning.
And you prefer her to me?
Well, yeah.
I prefer Nicole to pretty much everyone.
That's why I married her.
Together forever.
(CHUCKLES)
Loyalty.
I admire that in a man.
I am going to need your help if I am to remain free.
(ENGINE REVVING)
Jimmy!
I swear to protect you and keep you safe.
But I don't even know your name.
It's Lorelei.
My name is Lorelei.
Ripped By mstoll
Previously on "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...
Why would S.H.I.E.L.D. keep details of your death from you?
What happened in Tahiti?
Director Fury...
He had a team of scientists working around the clock
- I wanted to die.
- And we should have let you.
Once we capture Quinn, we'll be one step closer to the Clairvoyant.
- Where's Skye?
- Agent Coulson, it's dangerous... sending her in like that, all alone.
Oh.
Oh, god.
Hang on.
- Put her in there!
- Is it working?
!
We need to get her to a medical facility and fast.
1x14
- T.A.H.I.T.I.
She was shot twice in the abdomen at close range almost two hours ago.
She's tachycardic, hypotensive, and lost a significant amount of blood.
We had to lower her core body temp in order to transport her here.
It's probably what kept her alive this long.
We'll do everything we can.
- Oh, dear.
I'm a mess.
- No.
You were great.
Intubate, and let's start getting that shirt off.
Okay, let's prep her for ex-lap.
I'm here.
That's unacceptable.
I need to speak to Director Fury immediately, please.
Why didn't I stop her?
- I could have.
- As if you could stop Skye doing anything she's set her mind to.
I shouldn't have let her go after Quinn by herself.
What was I thinking?
It's not your fault.
She shouldn't have been there.
I'm her S.O. It's on me.
The one to blame is the man who shot her, Ian Quinn.
He's responsible.
Yes, the message is, I have an agent dying, and there are questions only he can answer.
- How is she?
- Not good.
The shots perforated her stomach and penetrated the large and small intestines.
We resected what we could, but...
- there's been too much damage.
- So what's next?
We can keep her comfortable, but you'll need to make a decision on whether or not you want to keep her on life support.
You're saying there's nothing to be done?
I'm saying you need to call her family and get them here as soon as possible.
We're her family.
In that case, I'm very sorry.
Finally.
I was beginning to think you'd forgotten...
Wait!
You can't!
Why?
'Cause you're defenseless, like she was?
May!
May!
Outside, now.
Aah.
He deserves to die, not her!
Agreed.
But right now, Quinn doesn't matter... only Skye does, and I need you to pilot the plane.
You heard what the doctor said.
She said there was nothing more they could do for her, but there are doctors who brought me back from the dead.
If they can do that, I'm betting they can save Skye.
H.Q. radioed in.
They've ordered us to hand over Quinn for interrogation and transport to the fridge.
Do you want me to arrange the transfer?
No.
Quinn stays in our custody until I say otherwise.
Yes, sir.
Are you sure about this, taking her all the way to Bethesda?
It's where my file says I was treated after New York.
I understand, but what makes you think the doctors there will be able to do anything different?
- I know they saved you, but...
- They did a lot more than save me.
It's time you know the truth.
That can't be.
What you're describing...
it's medically impossible.
Except for the fact that I'm standing here... proof that it's not impossible.
And here's more proof... my file, describing how they brought me back... the doctors, the procedures, the drugs.
Sir... it's against the law for us to read this.
- Are you sure?
- I don't care about your clearance level.
I'm ordering you to read it.
"Death and recovery report."
It's only recently that director Fury gave me access to this.
I've gone over it dozens of times.
I need you to decipher the medical parts of it
I didn't understand.
Feel free to reach out to Dr. Streiten.
He should be eager to answer any questions you may have.
Yes, I'm sure I'll have quite a few.
- So, what about Tahiti?
- Turns out, not so magical, just false memories implanted to cover up what was done.
Sir... it says here your heart was perforated, torn in half.
That part of it I understood.
And yet, they managed to heal the damaged tissue completely.
We need to understand how.
- So we can do the same for Skye.
- That's what I'm counting on.
- We'll get right on it, sir.
- Thank you.
- Hurt much?
- I'm fine.
Coulson told me how long he was dead.
But you already knew that, didn't you?
I saw Skye... in the pod, machines filtering her blood, breathing for her.
I'm not sure I'd make this play... fly halfway around the world hoping for a second miracle.
If Coulson thinks there's a chance in a million to save Skye, to save any of us, he'd take it.
People like us...
we need people like him.
So, yeah, it makes sense... a lot more sense than the alternative.
- You mean giving up?
- Or killing the man responsible.
I did like seeing you go after Quinn.
You don't open the blinds like that very often.
S.H.I.E.L.D. 616, this is tower Michael Tango.
You are in violation of S.H.I.E.L.D. directive 1297.
- Respond immediately.
- Disobeying a direct order.
We didn't hand Quinn over for interrogation.
Great.
This is S.H.I.E.L.D. 616.
How do we proceed?
Prepare to be boarded and relinquish command.
Really?
All the war and chaos in the world, and S.H.I.E.L.D. sends a plane after us?
Three planes...
a small transport to dock and a pair of F-35s to make sure we hand over Quinn.
If they scratched my paint, I'm gonna be pissed.
I'll await your orders, sir.
Garrett?
What the hell are you doing here?
Well, as opposed to the level 8 jackass I'm staring at,
- I still follow orders.
- You're the worst at following orders.
Maybe... but I like this one.
You are to immediately turn Ian Quinn over for transport to the fridge.
Agent Antoine Triplett, Agent Phillip Coulson.
You wouldn't know it to look at him, but Phil's one of our finest.
An honor, sir.
Trip joined me as my specialist after Ward came to your circus.
- Go secure the prisoner.
- Yes, sir.
Phil, come on.
Just because Fury gave you this pretty plane doesn't mean they won't shoot it out of the sky.
Why are you really here, Garrett?
S.H.I.E.L.D. could have sent any security team to collect Quinn.
Why you?
- You've been chasing him, too!
- Since Malta.
Then yesterday, your little Italian job cost my team weeks of work.
- You can't have him, not yet.
- This isn't a request.
Quinn shot one of my agents.
She's on life support in a med pod downstairs.
We are taking her to the trauma center in Bethesda.
Quinn actually pulled the trigger?
Skye infiltrated his compound in Malta.
When he saw her yesterday, seems he took it personally.
I never took him for a triggerman.
He pays others for that.
I've lost three of my own chasing him.
Then you understand why I can't give him to you until we save my agent.
Because if she doesn't make it...
- Agent Grant Ward.
- Trip.
- Is Garrett upstairs?
- Yeah.
You know, he still talks about that thousand-yard shot you took in Bandung.
It was 2,000.
So, what are you doing here?
Man, this is like the Playboy jet.
I mean, a guy could get soft bunking in a space like this.
How did Coulson swing such a sweet ride?
- He died.
- That's tight.
You want to point me to the box you're keeping Quinn?
H.Q. ordered Garrett to haul his ass to the fridge for questioning.
- Is that a full bar?
- You're welcome to it.
But, Quinn stays put till Coulson says otherwise.
Come on, man.
Garrett was your S.O., too, so you know how this works.
- Why don't you remind me?
- Garrett wants Quinn.
It's my job to make sure Garrett gets what he wants.
- Now where is he?
- Can't help you with that.
No worries.
I'll find Quinn myself.
I'm sure he's tucked between the jacuzzi and the squash court.
Hey.
Agent Ward, stand down.
Agent Garrett and I have come to an agreement.
He convinced H.Q. he could interrogate Quinn here on our plane as we continue to Bethesda.
Well, I'm a bit of a sweet talker when I need to be.
You wouldn't believe what I could talk this son of a gun into.
- Good seeing you, son.
- You, too, sir.
And thank you.
Saving the girl's top priority, and she might know something.
I've never heard of half the drugs they gave Coulson...
GH-325?
And what about this robotic-assisted-neural-micro-surgery they used to implant the Tahiti memories?
- It all sounds so diabolical.
- I agree.
We can't argue with the results.
He's walking around.
Yeah but at what cost?
You read the transcripts.
He begged the doctors to let him die.
This is different.
Skye's still alive.
We have to keep her that way.
Oh.
I've asked Dr. Streiten to advise us.
Hello.
Yes.
Are you sure?
That can't be.
And here I thought I was gonna get to play bad cop.
Ian Quinn, this is Agent Garrett.
- He's here to ask you some questions.
- Oh, no, thank you.
I... my head's still ringing from the last visitor.
At least the last visitor left you with a head.
I'm not always that considerate.
I'm interested in one of your newer projects.
Oh, but there are so many to choose from.
Let me be clear... you have no rights.
You have no lawyer.
The only thing keeping Agent Coulson here from throwing you out of this plane is the very weak heartbeat of a young agent downstairs, and the only incentive I have for not tearing your tongue out is that you use it to answer my questions.
Is that clear?
- You understand that?
- No.
Aah.
Tell us about Cybertek and the Deathlok program.
- Deathlok?
- Catchy, right?
Sounds like some wrestler from the '80s.
What is it really?
Those are dangerous waters, and the last agent that waded into them wound up with two in the stomach.
So... she's still alive?
Yeah.
And you better hope she stays that way.
Is that why you shot Skye, because she saw what Cybertek delivered?
No.
I shot Skye because that's what the Clairvoyant told me to do.
You wanted to see me?
I just got off the phone with the trauma center in Bethesda.
Dr. Streiten's gone off the grid.
So we'll find a different doctor there who operated on Coulson.
- That's the thing.
Actually...
- Coulson was never treated there.
- You're not making sense.
- None of this makes sense.
The doctors listed, the operating-room number... none of them exist.
None of them are part of S.H.I.E.L.D.
What I find surprising is how a big-shot billionaire could fall for this psychic mumbo jumbo.
Oh, I doubted it at the beginning, but then I realized it would be mutually beneficial.
He must have something pretty terrible on you.
Shooting an unarmed girl?
Let's just say I learned the hard way that obeying was in my best interest.
Yet... here you are.
Let me assure you it wasn't luck that led me to your partner's black sedan in Berlin or that he'd open the door for a redhead or those two agents in Morocco.
Do you think it was just a roll of the dice that my people found them in that Riad?
No, it was the Clairvoyant.
Your Clairvoyant say anything about me knocking your teeth in?
The Clairvoyant sees everything except what happened to him.
This is still about me.
Wait.
You're gonna need to rewind the tape, Phil.
You heard about my near-death before the battle of New York?
There's more to it than that.
I thought I was gone for seconds...
- turns out it was days.
- That's impossible.
Which is why the Clairvoyant will do anything to know how it happened.
- Even order you to shoot Skye.
- Wait.
You don't know what S.H.I.E.L.D. did to save you.
That's why we're flying to where I was treated.
So shooting the girl forces you to figure it all out.
- So the Clairvoyant can finally see.
- Or you let the girl die.
Quinn shot Skye for nothing.
The place we were going, the doctors who treated you...
- they don't exist.
- Or maybe they exist somewhere else.
This is S.H.I.E.L.D. There are always secrets.
That's my fear, sir.
Your file is filled with secrets... experimental drugs, unknown surgical procedures we've never even heard of.
Frankly, Fitz and I only understand about 70% of what's in here.
Even if we do find where they treated you and we were able to replicate the procedure, there's the other obvious question.
- Which is?
- Whether we should.
What you experienced, sir, if this file is even partially accurate...
No one's suggesting that we submit Skye to everything that I went through, but if there's something in here... a drug, a treatment that can save her, we need to find it.
- Figure it out.
- Yes, sir.
- You disagree.
- No.
I think we need to do everything humanly possible to save Skye.
But we need to acknowledge that doing so might give the Clairvoyant exactly what he wants.
It's a risk we have to take.
How is she?
Deteriorating, and I don't know how to stop it.
The only thing I've found remotely interesting
- is something called "GH-325."
- Some kind of drug?
Agent Coulson was injected with that, and literally minutes later, his wounds showed signs of cellular regeneration.
Regeneration?
Is that even possible?
Even if this miracle drug does exist, we don't know where to find it.
We have no coordinates, no logs of anyone's departure or arrival.
I think maybe I can help with that.
- You've set up the echo-chamber.
- Yeah, I made a couple of calls.
A buddy of mine works in the archives at the Triskelion.
Agreed to let us access it from here.
Hard to believe, but this cube contains all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s historical administrative data.
Yeah, but if Agent Coulson's operation didn't take place at a S.H.I.E.L.D. medical facility...
We won't find any record of it here...
I know.
But this also contains all interoffice memos, travel arrangements, purchase orders.
Maybe we can track down the location through a virtual paper trail of some sort or another.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, let's start with the travel memoranda from the date Coulson got stabbed.
Here we go.
Or, um, what about Dr. Streiten's departure from the Triskelion?
- Maybe they have that.
- Yeah.
- Here.
This is interesting.
- A World War II bunker?
"Collapsed" bunker.
Definitely not a sanctioned S.H.I.E.L.D. facility.
- "The Guest House"?
- Exactly.
Guest House...
G.H. GH-325.
Look at the file's access history.
- The only record of it being opened...
- Is by a level 10 operative.
Director Fury.
So, Fury's been to this place, and he's the person who sanctioned the operations on Agent Coulson.
And why aren't you trying to find the file?
Damn.
Encrypted.
Skye could crack this.
What would she do?
It's not an encryption.
The Guest House is not a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility.
We don't know who or what's in there.
- Be prepared for potential resistance.
- No contact from inside?
I've tried every known channel... no response.
- Place could be abandoned.
- Let's hope not.
We need the people inside to work on Skye.
Simmons is prepping Skye to move at a moment's notice, sir.
Trip can help.
He's had med-tech training.
Good.
We do our jobs right, this will all go peacefully.
- What if they don't want to help us?
- I'll say "pretty please."
We need the doctors alive and the place intact.
If it does go sideways, Fitz, I need you down there to determine what Simmons can use to help Skye.
And then we take it.
Let's move.
Company?
Nothing's scheduled for a couple weeks.
Try the protocol.
How was the drive from Istanbul?
- Countersign?
- No clue.
- Never heard it.
- I can't find it in any of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s protocol directives.
This is Agent Coulson with S.H.I.E.L.D.
We don't know the counter, but we have a team member in dire need of medical assistance.
We know she can be treated here.
Open the doors.
Maybe we can work something out.
Do you copy?
How was the drive from Istanbul?
We're looking for medical assistance.
A person's life is at stake.
Will you help us?
How was the drive from Istanbul?
"Pretty please" it is.
These guys are good...
hacked their way in.
How the hell did they find this place?
Doesn't matter.
Didn't know the countersign.
- You want left or right?
- Left's good.
There's an antechamber and a set of glass doors.
Can't see much beyond that.
Lights are all out.
Well, they know we're coming.
Let's go say "hello."
Clear.
Okay, Simmons, we're going in now.
Simmons?
Damn it.
Comms are down.
There's too much mountain on top of us.
Trust me... it's better.
You don't want them hearing the horrible death we're walking into.
Humor, son.
You Brits are too serious.
- Besides, if the job was easy...
- It wouldn't be any fun.
I'm not afraid... not yet.
I suspect the real danger won't happen until we breach that bulletproof glass.
Probably a stairwell back to the surface.
What do you think, Fitz?
Can you get us inside?
To certain, horrible death?
Absolutely.
Okay, sir, just say the word.
Once we get inside, everybody find cover.
All right, gentlemen, here we go.
We've come for medical assistance.
But you continue firing on us, we will defend oursel...
- I count two hostiles.
- Copy that.
Ready?
You got one of those little flash things?
Yeah.
Ward!
Clear!
- See if you can get some lights on.
- Yeah.
No hard feelings, Bob.
Clear.
We're not done.
This one's hit.
Shouldn't be too hard to find.
Go.
We're gonna get you medical help.
Is anyone else down here?
Where are the doctors?
Med staff doesn't stay here.
We're looking for a drug...
GH-325.
It might help you, too.
- Do I... k-know you?
- I don't know.
I-I might have spent some time here awhile back.
Then you know about... the timer.
We got a problem!
Semtex.
The whole place is rigged to blow.
There's enough explosive to bring down the whole mountain on top of us.
Sir.
Less than 10 minutes.
It's probably a failsafe.
If the guards had eliminated us, they'd stop the timer.
Since they didn't...
It's some kind of emergency override.
Skye could probably get past it, but I can't hack the panel, which means we're trapped in here.
You're the guy who taught Ward how to disarm nuclear bombs.
Figure out a way to get us out of here.
Let's go find the drug.
So this is some sort of medical facility.
Yeah, but if nobody's here, I'm not sure it's gonna do us any good.
Tough when it's your team.
You guys go back a ways?
Not really.
A few months.
We have nothing in common...
couldn't be more different.
But you can't imagine your life without her.
Yes.
You've experienced that, Agent Triplett?
I have.
Sometimes, a person takes you by surprise.
Yeah.
She's very lucky to have you.
I know anything bad ever happens to me, hope you're in my corner, too.
Comms are down.
If I don't hear anything within the hour, I'm going after them.
Skye's coding.
Both of you, now.
How can we help?
I need a unit of Epi.
Got it.
Don't.
Let me die.
Please.
Let me die!
- Is that where...
- Yeah.
The timer doesn't control the explosion.
It's just a clock.
Detonator must be somewhere else.
It's not in here, or I'd have found it.
There's no time to search the whole compound.
Maybe we can take some semtex, use it on the doors.
Sir, are you sure you want to?
We should put suits on before we go in there.
You're right, but there's no time.
I wish I could speak to Simmons.
She'd know what most of this stuff is... or, at least, what stuff not to touch.
Fitz.
Oh.
I don't see any G.H...
Agent Coulson.
It's locked.
Here.
Put these on.
Got it.
Time to go.
We couldn't stop it.
Four minutes and counting.
Almost there.
There's semtex throughout here, as well.
This is it... 325.
- This is the one we want.
- We gotta go.
- Get it up to Simmons.
- Yeah.
Sir.
I'll be right behind you.
Go.
Three minutes.
Have you worked much with munitions, Agent Fitz?
Explosives are a fascinating specialty... very exacting.
Too big a concussion could trigger a chain reaction... bury us like fossils for a thousand years.
Guess we don't have to worry about the Clairvoyant finding this place.
Agent Ward...
would you do the honors?
Thought you'd never ask.
Can you slip through?
- Yeah
- Go.
All right.
Get that drug up there.
- Coulson.
- Where the hell is he?
Phil!
Go with Fitz.
Make sure that drug gets to the girl.
- Agent Garrett.
- Go!
Save the girl.
Weak, erratic heart rate.
Each time we save her, I ask myself, "is this what Skye would want?"
We didn't come this far to quit.
Get off...
the ground immediately.
They're alive.
Maybe we can...
Fitz, come in.
What's your status?
Phil!
Phil, what the hell?
Clock's not slowing down.
- It's about to get really warm in here.
- Hey, you with me?
The guys are out already.
They took the drug up to Skye.
No, don't give it to her.
The drug... they can't give it to her!
All right.
You can tell them yourself.
Right now, we just need to get out of this mountain and off the ground.
Now let's go.
You want more epinephrine?
- We found it.
- What is it?
And how much, injected where?
May, get us off the ground, or it'll fall out from under us.
No!
Don't give it to her!
I was losing her, anyway.
What harm can it do?
Come on, girl.
It's working.
She's spiking.
Stop it.
How can we stop it?
Skye!
- What's happening?
- I don't know...
Skye!
Do something...
we have to do something!
Her heartbeat... she's stabilizing.
Simmons?
Could someone tell me what we just saw?
The girl's a fighter.
What was that stuff you just gave her?
I don't know.
All I know is that it worked.
You're a real miracle worker.
You did it.
Something happen down there?
I'm not sure.
One minute, he was fine.
The next, it was like he had seen a ghost.
I have good news and bad news.
Which would you like to hear first?
Bad news, then...
there's a fair amount.
Your Clairvoyant, the one who said he'd have your back... he's a no-show.
The site we were supposed to lead him to with our minds... blown to pieces, buried under 100 feet of rock.
It seems the only psychic power your buddy has shown is the ability to predict if you tell tell a rich, entitled dirtbag he's gonna get away with murder, he'll believe it.
Trip.
Girl's gonna live... live to testify how a billionaire shot her point-blank in the stomach.
Oh, we got a great little home movie of you admitting that, genius.
This Clairvoyant played you and left you to rot.
- You said there was good news.
- I did?
Oh, yeah.
You still have your tongue.
Let's go.
I want to thank you, Garrett, for letting us keep Quinn on the plane.
Don't mention it.
There's still time for me to make the rest of his life a long, living hell.
I'm counting on it.
- Something I need to ask you, Phil.
- Of course.
- We've known each other a long time.
- Yes, we have.
Been in our share of tight spots together.
If it had gone the other way...
if Skye hadn't survived, were you really prepared to throw Quinn off this plane?
You were the one who made that threat.
I just asked to keep him on the plane for awhile.
You're right.
It was me.
- My mistake.
- Till next time.
Might be sooner than you think.
My man Trip's got eyes for that biotech gal of yours.
Do you mind?
You did the impossible today.
You saved Skye's life.
Why aren't you happy about it?
They told me you were yelling...
to not use the drug, to not use it on Skye.
Why?
What made you change your mind?
Phil?
Phil!
You all right?
Being down there... seeing where I came from...
I just got really scared that she would suffer the way that I did.
But she didn't.
For whatever reason...
she didn't.
"Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D." will return in a moment.
I'm gonna go see if they have a map.
I'll be waiting in the car, Mrs. Mackenzie.
- Are you okay?
- No.
No, I'm parched and weary.
Is all of Midgard so desolate?
Midgard?
I don't know where that is.
- This is Death Valley.
- Oh.
I seek passage from this...
valley of death to a more bountiful land.
I wish I could help, but...
it's built for two.
Y-you should ask the manager inside.
Maybe there's a bus later today.
- She's your bride?
- Yep, since yesterday morning.
And you prefer her to me?
Well... yeah.
I prefer Nicole to pretty much everyone.
That's why I married her...
together forever.
Loyalty...
I admire that in a man.
I am going to need your help...
if I am to remain free.
Jimmy!
I swear to protect you and keep you safe, but I don't even know your name.
It's Lorelei.
My name is Lorelei.
Coulson:
Previously on "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...
Raina:
Why would S.H.I.E.L.D. keep details of your death from you?
What happened in Tahiti?
Dr. Streiten:
Director Fury ...
He had a team of scientists working around the clock
- I wanted to die.
- And we should have let you.
Coulson:
Once we capture Quinn, we'll be one step closer to the Clairvoyant.
- Where's Skye?
- Agent Coulson, it's dangerous... sending her in like that, all alone.
[gunshot]
Oh.
Oh, god.
Hang on.
- Put her in there!
- Is it working?
!
We need to get her to a medical facility and fast.
1x14
- T.A.H.I.T.I.
She was shot twice in the abdomen at close range almost two hours ago.
She's tachycardic, hypotensive, and lost a significant amount of blood.
We had to lower her core body temp in order to transport her here.
It's probably what kept her alive this long.
We'll do everything we can.
- Oh, dear.
I'm a mess.
- No.
You were great.
Intubate, and let's start getting that shirt off.
[monitor beeping] [medical chatter]
Okay, let's prep her for ex-lap.
I'm here.
That's unacceptable.
I need to speak to Director Fury immediately, please.
Why didn't I stop her?
- I could have.
- As if you could stop Skye doing anything she's set her mind to.
I shouldn't have let her go after Quinn by herself.
What was I thinking?
It's not your fault.
She shouldn't have been there.
I'm her S.O. It's on me.
The one to blame is the man who shot her, Ian Quinn.
He's responsible.
Coulson:
Yes, the message is, I have an agent dying, and there are questions only he can answer.
[beep] [clank] [sighs]
[birds chirping]
[woman talking over P.A.]
- How is she?
- Not good.
The shots perforated her stomach and penetrated the large and small intestines.
We resected what we could, but...
- there's been too much damage.
- So what's next?
We can keep her comfortable, but you'll need to make a decision on whether or not you want to keep her on life support.
You're saying there's nothing to be done?
I'm saying you need to call her family and get them here as soon as possible.
We're her family.
In that case, I'm very sorry.
Finally.
I was beginning to think you'd forgotten ...
Ohh.
[grunting]
Wait!
You can't!
[grunts] Why?
'Cause you're defenseless, like she was?
[grunting]
May!
May!
[breathing heavily]
Outside, now.
Aah.
He deserves to die, not her!
Agreed.
But right now, Quinn doesn't matter ... only Skye does, and I need you to pilot the plane.
You heard what the doctor said.
She said there was nothing more they could do for her, but there are doctors who brought me back from the dead.
If they can do that, I'm betting they can save Skye.
[metal clangs] [monitor beeping]
H.Q. radioed in.
They've ordered us to hand over Quinn for interrogation and transport to the fridge.
Do you want me to arrange the transfer?
No.
Quinn stays in our custody until I say otherwise.
Yes, sir.
Are you sure about this, taking her all the way to Bethesda?
It's where my file says I was treated after New York.
I understand, but what makes you think the doctors there will be able to do anything different?
- I know they saved you, but ...
- They did a lot more than save me.
It's time you know the truth.
Simmons:
That can't be.
What you're describing ...
it's medically impossible.
Except for the fact that I'm standing here ... proof that it's not impossible.
And here's more proof ... my file, describing how they brought me back ... the doctors, the procedures, the drugs.
Sir... it's against the law for us to read this.
- Are you sure?
- I don't care about your clearance level.
I'm ordering you to read it.
"Death and recovery report."
It's only recently that director Fury gave me access to this.
I've gone over it dozens of times.
I need you to decipher the medical parts of it
I didn't understand.
Feel free to reach out to Dr. Streiten.
He should be eager to answer any questions you may have.
Yes, I'm sure I'll have quite a few.
- So, what about Tahiti?
- Turns out, not so magical, just false memories implanted to cover up what was done.
Sir... it says here your heart was perforated, torn in half.
That part of it I understood.
And yet, they managed to heal the damaged tissue completely.
We need to understand how.
- So we can do the same for Skye.
- That's what I'm counting on.
- We'll get right on it, sir.
- Thank you.
[sighs]
- Hurt much?
- I'm fine.
Coulson told me how long he was dead.
But you already knew that, didn't you?
I saw Skye... in the pod, machines filtering her blood, breathing for her.
I'm not sure I'd make this play ... fly halfway around the world hoping for a second miracle.
If Coulson thinks there's a chance in a million to save Skye, to save any of us, he'd take it.
People like us ...
we need people like him.
So, yeah, it makes sense ... a lot more sense than the alternative.
- You mean giving up?
- Or killing the man responsible.
I did like seeing you go after Quinn.
You don't open the blinds like that very often.
Woman:
S.H.I.E.L.D. 616, this is tower Michael Tango.
You are in violation of S.H.I.E.L.D. directive 1297.
- Respond immediately.
- Disobeying a direct order.
We didn't hand Quinn over for interrogation.
Great.
[engines roar]
This is S.H.I.E.L.D. 616.
How do we proceed?
Prepare to be boarded and relinquish command.
Really?
All the war and chaos in the world, and S.H.I.E.L.D. sends a plane after us?
Three planes ...
a small transport to dock and a pair of F-35s to make sure we hand over Quinn.
[thud] [whirring]
If they scratched my paint, I'm gonna be pissed.
I'll await your orders, sir.
Garrett?
What the hell are you doing here?
Well, as opposed to the level 8 jackass I'm staring at,
- I still follow orders.
- You're the worst at following orders.
Maybe... but I like this one.
You are to immediately turn Ian Quinn over for transport to the fridge.
Agent Antoine Triplett, Agent Phillip Coulson.
You wouldn't know it to look at him, but Phil's one of our finest.
An honor, sir.
Trip joined me as my specialist after Ward came to your circus.
- Go secure the prisoner.
- Yes, sir.
Phil, come on.
Just because Fury gave you this pretty plane doesn't mean they won't shoot it out of the sky.
Why are you really here, Garrett?
S.H.I.E.L.D. could have sent any security team to collect Quinn.
Why you?
- You've been chasing him, too!
- Since Malta.
Then yesterday, your little Italian job cost my team weeks of work.
- You can't have him, not yet.
- This isn't a request.
Quinn shot one of my agents.
She's on life support in a med pod downstairs.
We are taking her to the trauma center in Bethesda.
Quinn actually pulled the trigger?
Skye infiltrated his compound in Malta.
When he saw her yesterday, seems he took it personally.
I never took him for a triggerman.
He pays others for that.
I've lost three of my own chasing him.
Then you understand why I can't give him to you until we save my agent.
Because if she doesn't make it...
- Agent Grant Ward.
- Trip. [chuckles]
- Is Garrett upstairs?
- Yeah.
You know, he still talks about that thousand-yard shot you took in Bandung.
It was 2,000.
So, what are you doing here?
- Man, this is like the Playboy jet.
- Mm. [chuckles]
I mean, a guy could get soft bunking in a space like this.
How did Coulson swing such a sweet ride?
- He died.
- That's tight.
You want to point me to the box you're keeping Quinn?
H.Q. ordered Garrett to haul his ass to the fridge for questioning.
[breathes sharply]
- Is that a full bar?
- You're welcome to it.
But, uh, Quinn stays put till Coulson says otherwise.
Come on, man.
Garrett was your S.O., too, so you know how this works.
- Why don't you remind me?
- Garrett wants Quinn.
It's my job to make sure Garrett gets what he wants.
- Now where is he?
- Can't help you with that.
No worries.
I'll find Quinn myself.
I'm sure he's tucked between the jacuzzi and the squash court.
Hey.
[both grunting]
Agent Ward, stand down.
[coughs]
Agent Garrett and I have come to an agreement.
He convinced H.Q. he could interrogate Quinn here on our plane as we continue to Bethesda.
Well, I'm a bit of a sweet talker when I need to be.
You wouldn't believe what I could talk this son of a gun into.
- Good seeing you, son.
- You, too, sir.
And thank you.
Saving the girl's top priority, and she might know something.
I've never heard of half the drugs they gave Coulson ...
GH-325?
And what about this robotic-assisted- neural-micro-surgery they used to implant the Tahiti memories?
- It all sounds so diabolical.
- I agree.
We can't argue with the results.
He's walking around.
Yeah but at what cost?
You read the transcripts.
He begged the doctors to let him die.
This is different.
Skye's still alive.
We have to keep her that way.
[cellphone vibrates]
Oh.
I've asked Dr. Streiten to advise us.
[beep] Hello.
Yes.
Are you sure?
That can't be.
[door opens]
And here I thought I was gonna get to play bad cop.
Ian Quinn, this is Agent Garrett.
- He's here to ask you some questions.
- Oh, no, thank you.
I ... my head's still ringing from the last visitor.
At least the last visitor left you with a head.
I'm not always that considerate.
I'm interested in one of your newer projects.
Hmm?
Oh, but there are so many to choose from.
[grunts]
Let me be clear ... you have no rights.
You have no lawyer.
The only thing keeping Agent Coulson here from throwing you out of this plane is the very weak heartbeat of a young agent downstairs, and the only incentive I have for not tearing your tongue out is that you use it to answer my questions.
Is that clear?
[mumbling] Mm-hmm.
- You understand that?
- No.
[groans]
Aah.
Ohh.
Tell us about Cybertek and the Deathlok program.
- Deathlok?
- Catchy, right?
Sounds like some wrestler from the '80s.
What is it really?
Those are dangerous waters, and the last agent that waded into them wound up with two in the stomach.
[grunting]
So... she's still alive?
Yeah.
And you better hope she stays that way.
Is that why you shot Skye, because she saw what Cybertek delivered?
No.
I shot Skye because that's what the Clairvoyant told me to do.
May:
You wanted to see me?
I just got off the phone with the trauma center in Bethesda.
Dr. Streiten's gone off the grid.
So we'll find a different doctor there who operated on Coulson.
- That's the thing.
Actually...
- Coulson was never treated there.
- You're not making sense.
- None of this makes sense.
The doctors listed, the operating-room number ... none of them exist.
None of them are part of S.H.I.E.L.D.
What I find surprising is how a big-shot billionaire could fall for this psychic mumbo jumbo.
Oh, I doubted it at the beginning, but then I realized it would be mutually beneficial.
He must have something pretty terrible on you.
Shooting an unarmed girl?
Let's just say I learned the hard way that obeying was in my best interest.
Yet... here you are.
Let me assure you it wasn't luck that led me to your partner's black sedan in Berlin or that he'd open the door for a redhead or those two agents in Morocco.
Do you think it was just a roll of the dice that my people found them in that Riad?
No, it was the Clairvoyant.
Your Clairvoyant say anything about me knocking your teeth in?
The Clairvoyant sees everything except what happened to him.
This is still about me.
Wait.
You're gonna need to rewind the tape, Phil.
You heard about my near-death before the battle of New York?
There's more to it than that.
I thought I was gone for seconds ...
- turns out it was days.
- That's impossible.
Which is why the Clairvoyant will do anything to know how it happened.
- Even order you to shoot Skye.
- Garrett:
Wait.
You don't know what S.H.I.E.L.D. did to save you.
That's why we're flying to where I was treated.
So shooting the girl forces you to figure it all out.
- So the Clairvoyant can finally see.
- Or you let the girl die.
[sighs] [engine roars]
Quinn shot Skye for nothing.
The place we were going, the doctors who treated you ...
- they don't exist.
- Or maybe they exist somewhere else.
This is S.H.I.E.L.D. There are always secrets.
That's my fear, sir.
Your file is filled with secrets ... experimental drugs, unknown surgical procedures we've never even heard of.
Frankly, Fitz and I only understand about 70% of what's in here.
Even if we do find where they treated you and we were able to replicate the procedure, there's the other obvious question.
- Which is?
- Whether we should.
What you experienced, sir, if this file is even partially accurate ...
No one's suggesting that we submit Skye to everything that I went through, but if there's something in here ... a drug, a treatment that can save her, we need to find it.
- Figure it out.
- Yes, sir.
- You disagree.
- No.
I think we need to do everything humanly possible to save Skye.
But we need to acknowledge that doing so might give the Clairvoyant exactly what he wants.
It's a risk we have to take.
[sighs] [monitor beeping]
How is she?
Deteriorating, and I don't know how to stop it.
The only thing I've found remotely interesting
- is something called "GH-325."
- Some kind of drug?
Agent Coulson was injected with that, and literally minutes later, his wounds showed signs of cellular regeneration.
Regeneration?
Is that even possible?
Even if this miracle drug does exist, we don't know where to find it.
We have no coordinates, no logs of anyone's departure or arrival.
I think maybe I can help with that.
- You've set up the echo-chamber.
- Yeah, I made a couple of calls.
A buddy of mine works in the archives at the Triskelion.
Agreed to let us access it from here.
Hard to believe, but this cube contains all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s historical administrative data.
Yeah, but if Agent Coulson's operation didn't take place at a S.H.I.E.L.D. medical facility ...
We won't find any record of it here ...
I know.
But this also contains all interoffice memos, travel arrangements, purchase orders.
Maybe we can track down the location through a virtual paper trail of some sort or another.
Yeah. [beeping] [gasps] [sighs] Okay.
Well, let's start with the travel memoranda from the date Coulson got stabbed.
[beeping]
Here we go.
Or, um, what about Dr. Streiten's departure from the Triskelion?
- Maybe they have that.
- Yeah.
- Here.
This is interesting.
- A World War II bunker?
"Collapsed" bunker.
Definitely not a sanctioned S.H.I.E.L.D. facility.
- "The Guest House"?
- Exactly.
Guest House ...
G.H. GH-325.
Look at the file's access history.
- The only record of it being opened...
- Is by a level 10 operative.
Director Fury.
So, Fury's been to this place, and he's the person who sanctioned the operations on Agent Coulson.
And why aren't you trying to find the file?
[beeping]
Ah, damn.
Encrypted.
Skye could crack this.
What would she do?
It's not an encryption.
[engine roars]
The Guest House is not a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility.
We don't know who or what's in there.
- Be prepared for potential resistance.
- No contact from inside?
May:
I've tried every known channel ... no response.
- Place could be abandoned.
- Let's hope not.
We need the people inside to work on Skye.
Simmons is prepping Skye to move at a moment's notice, sir.
Trip can help.
He's had med-tech training.
Good.
We do our jobs right, this will all go peacefully.
- What if they don't want to help us?
- I'll say "pretty please."
We need the doctors alive and the place intact.
If it does go sideways, Fitz, I need you down there to determine what Simmons can use to help Skye.
And then we take it.
Let's move.
[tone plays]
Alpha:
Company?
Nothing's scheduled for a couple weeks.
Try the protocol.
Alpha:
How was the drive from Istanbul?
- Countersign?
- No clue.
- Never heard it.
- Fitz:
I can't find it in any of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s protocol directives.
This is Agent Coulson with S.H.I.E.L.D.
We don't know the counter, but we have a team member in dire need of medical assistance.
We know she can be treated here.
Open the doors.
Maybe we can work something out.
Do you copy?
How was the drive from Istanbul?
We're looking for medical assistance.
A person's life is at stake.
Will you help us?
How was the drive from Istanbul?
"Pretty please" it is.
These guys are good...
hacked their way in.
How the hell did they find this place?
Doesn't matter.
Didn't know the countersign.
- You want left or right?
- Left's good.
[elevator bell dings]
There's an antechamber and a set of glass doors.
Can't see much beyond that.
Lights are all out.
Well, they know we're coming.
Let's go say "hello."
Clear.
Okay, Simmons, we're going in now.
Simmons?
Damn it.
Comms are down.
There's too much mountain on top of us.
Trust me ... it's better.
You don't want them hearing the horrible death we're walking into.
Humor, son.
You Brits are too serious.
- Besides, if the job was easy...
- It wouldn't be any fun.
I'm not afraid ... not yet.
I suspect the real danger won't happen until we breach that bulletproof glass.
Probably a stairwell back to the surface.
What do you think, Fitz?
Can you get us inside?
To certain, horrible death?
Absolutely.
Okay, sir, just say the word.
Once we get inside, everybody find cover.
All right, gentlemen, here we go.
[beep]
We've come for medical assistance.
But you continue firing on us, we will defend oursel...
- I count two hostiles.
- Copy that.
Ready?
You got one of those little flash things?
Yeah.
Ward!
[groans]
Clear!
- See if you can get some lights on.
- Yeah.
[sighs]
No hard feelings, Bob.
Clear.
We're not done.
This one's hit.
Shouldn't be too hard to find.
[music]
Coulson:
Go.
We're gonna get you medical help.
Is anyone else down here?
Where are the doctors?
Med staff doesn't stay here.
We're looking for a drug ...
GH-325.
It might help you, too.
- Do I... k-know you?
- I don't know.
I-I might have spent some time here awhile back.
Then you know about... the timer.
Garret:
We got a problem!
[breathes sharply]
Semtex.
The whole place is rigged to blow.
Fitz:
There's enough explosive to bring down the whole mountain on top of us.
Sir.
Less than 10 minutes.
It's probably a failsafe.
If the guards had eliminated us, they'd stop the timer.
Since they didn't...
Fitz:
It's some kind of emergency override.
Skye could probably get past it, but I can't hack the panel, which means we're trapped in here.
You're the guy who taught Ward how to disarm nuclear bombs.
Figure out a way to get us out of here.
Let's go find the drug.
So this is some sort of medical facility.
Yeah, but if nobody's here, I'm not sure it's gonna do us any good.
[monitor beeping]
Tough when it's your team.
You guys go back a ways?
Not really.
A few months.
We have nothing in common ...
couldn't be more different.
But you can't imagine your life without her.
Yes.
You've experienced that, Agent Triplett?
I have.
Sometimes, a person takes you by surprise.
Yeah.
She's very lucky to have you.
I know anything bad ever happens to me, hope you're in my corner, too.
[footsteps approach]
May:
Comms are down.
If I don't hear anything within the hour, I'm going after them.
[rapid beeping]
Skye's coding.
Both of you, now.
[flatline]
How can we help?
I need a unit of Epi.
Got it.
Don't.
Let me die.
Please.
Let me die!
- Is that where...
- Yeah.
The timer doesn't control the explosion.
It's just a clock.
Detonator must be somewhere else.
It's not in here, or I'd have found it.
There's no time to search the whole compound.
Maybe we can take some semtex, use it on the doors.
Sir, are you sure you want to?
We should put suits on before we go in there.
You're right, but there's no time.
I wish I could speak to Simmons.
She'd know what most of this stuff is ... or, at least, what stuff not to touch.
Uh...
Fitz.
Oh.
I don't see any G.H...
Agent Coulson.
It's locked.
Here.
Put these on.
Got it.
Time to go.
We couldn't stop it.
Four minutes and counting.
Almost there.
There's semtex throughout here, as well.
This is it ... 325.
- This is the one we want.
- We gotta go.
- Get it up to Simmons.
- Yeah.
Sir.
I'll be right behind you.
Go.
Three minutes.
Have you worked much with munitions, Agent Fitz?
Explosives are a fascinating specialty ... very exacting.
Too big a concussion could trigger a chain reaction ... bury us like fossils for a thousand years.
Guess we don't have to worry about the Clairvoyant finding this place.
Agent Ward...
would you do the honors?
Ward:
Thought you'd never ask.
[gun cocks]
Can you slip through?
- Yeah [grunts]
- Go.
All right.
Get that drug up there.
- Coulson.
- Where the hell is he?
Phil!
Go with Fitz.
Make sure that drug gets to the girl.
- Agent Garrett.
- Go!
Save the girl.
Simmons:
Weak, erratic heart rate.
Each time we save her, I ask myself, "is this what Skye would want?"
We didn't come this far to quit.
Fitz:
Get off... [static] the ground immediately.
They're alive.
Maybe we can ... [flatline] Fitz, come in.
What's your status?
[breathing sharply]
Garrett:
Phil!
Phil, what the hell?
Clock's not slowing down.
- It's about to get really warm in here.
- Hey, you with me?
The guys are out already.
They took the drug up to Skye.
No, don't give it to her.
The drug ... they can't give it to her!
All right.
You can tell them yourself.
Right now, we just need to get out of this mountain and off the ground.
Now let's go.
[flatline]
You want more epinephrine?
- We found it.
- What is it?
And how much, injected where?
May, get us off the ground, or it'll fall out from under us.
[whirring]
[engine roaring]
No!
Don't give it to her!
[flatline]
I was losing her, anyway.
What harm can it do?
[monitor beeping]
Come on, girl.
Garrett:
It's working.
[rapid beeping] Simmons:
She's spiking.
Stop it.
How can we stop it?
Skye!
- What's happening?
- [crying] I don't know...
Skye!
[grunting]
Fitz:
Do something ...
we have to do something!
[gasping]
[beeping slows]
Her heartbeat ... she's stabilizing.
Simmons?
[sighs]
Could someone tell me what we just saw?
The girl's a fighter.
What was that stuff you just gave her?
I don't know.
All I know is that it worked.
You're a real miracle worker.
You did it.
Something happen down there?
I'm not sure.
One minute, he was fine.
The next, it was like he had seen a ghost.
I have good news and bad news.
Which would you like to hear first?
[door closes]
Bad news, then ...
there's a fair amount.
Your Clairvoyant, the one who said he'd have your back ... he's a no-show.
The site we were supposed to lead him to with our minds ... blown to pieces, buried under 100 feet of rock.
It seems the only psychic power your buddy has shown is the ability to predict if you tell tell a rich, entitled dirtbag he's gonna get away with murder, he'll believe it.
Trip.
Girl's gonna live ... live to testify how a billionaire shot her point-blank in the stomach.
Oh, we got a great little home movie of you admitting that, genius.
This Clairvoyant played you and left you to rot.
- You said there was good news.
- I did?
Oh, yeah.
You still have your tongue.
[scoffs]
Let's go.
I want to thank you, Garrett, for letting us keep Quinn on the plane.
Don't mention it.
There's still time for me to make the rest of his life a long, living hell.
I'm counting on it.
- Something I need to ask you, Phil.
- Of course.
- We've known each other a long time.
- Yes, we have.
Been in our share of tight spots together.
If it had gone the other way...
if Skye hadn't survived, were you really prepared to throw Quinn off this plane?
You were the one who made that threat.
I just asked to keep him on the plane for awhile.
You're right.
It was me.
- My mistake.
- Till next time.
Might be sooner than you think.
My man Trip's got eyes for that biotech gal of yours.
[whirring]
Do you mind?
You did the impossible today.
You saved Skye's life.
Why aren't you happy about it?
[sighs]
They told me you were yelling...
to not use the drug, to not use it on Skye.
Why?
What made you change your mind?
[whirring]
[gasps]
Phil?
Phil!
You all right?
Being down there... seeing where I came from...
I just got really scared that she would suffer the way that I did.
But she didn't.
For whatever reason...
she didn't.
Coulson: "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D." will return in a moment.
Nicole:
I'm gonna go see if they have a map.
I'll be waiting in the car, Mrs. Mackenzie.
[chuckles]
[panting]
- Are you okay?
- [sighs] No.
No, I'm parched and weary.
Is all of Midgard so desolate?
Midgard?
I don't know where that is.
- This is Death Valley.
- Oh.
I seek passage from this...
valley of death to a more bountiful land.
I wish I could help,but...
it's built for two.
Y-you should ask the manager inside.
Uh, maybe there's a bus later today.
- She's your bride?
- Yep, since yesterday morning.
And you prefer her to me?
Well... yeah.
I prefer Nicole to pretty much everyone.
That's why I married her ...
together forever.
[chuckles]
Loyalty ...
I admire that in a man.
[echoing] I am going to need your help...
if I am to remain free.
[engine revs]
Jimmy!
I swear to protect you and keep you safe, but I don't even know your name.
It's Lorelei.
My name is Lorelei.
Coulson:
Previously on "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...
Raina:
Why would S.H.I.E.L.D. keep details of your death from you?
What happened in Tahiti?
Dr. Streiten:
Director Fury...
He had a team of scientists working around the clock
- I wanted to die.
- And we should have let you.
Coulson:
Once we capture Quinn, we'll be one step closer to the Clairvoyant.
- Where's Skye?
- Agent Coulson, it's dangerous... sending her in like that, all alone.
[gunshot]
Oh.
Oh, god.
Hang on.
- Put her in there!
- Is it working?
!
We need to get her to a medical facility and fast.
1x14
- T.A.H.I.T.I.
She was shot twice in the abdomen at close range almost two hours ago.
She's tachycardic, hypotensive, and lost a significant amount of blood.
We had to lower her core body temp in order to transport her here.
It's probably what kept her alive this long.
We'll do everything we can.
- Oh, dear.
I'm a mess.
- No.
You were great.
Intubate, and let's start getting that shirt off.
[monitor beeping] [medical chatter]
Okay, let's prep her for ex-lap.
I'm here.
That's unacceptable.
I need to speak to Director Fury immediately, please.
Why didn't I stop her?
- I could have.
- As if you could stop Skye doing anything she's set her mind to.
I shouldn't have let her go after Quinn by herself.
What was I thinking?
It's not your fault.
She shouldn't have been there.
I'm her S.O. It's on me.
The one to blame is the man who shot her, Ian Quinn.
He's responsible.
Coulson:
Yes, the message is, I have an agent dying, and there are questions only he can answer.
[beep] [clank] [sighs]
[birds chirping]
[woman talking over P.A.]
- How is she?
- Not good.
The shots perforated her stomach and penetrated the large and small intestines.
We resected what we could, but...
- there's been too much damage.
- So what's next?
We can keep her comfortable, but you'll need to make a decision on whether or not you want to keep her on life support.
You're saying there's nothing to be done?
I'm saying you need to call her family and get them here as soon as possible.
We're her family.
In that case, I'm very sorry.
Finally.
I was beginning to think you'd forgotten...
Ohh.
[grunting]
Wait!
You can't!
[grunts] Why?
'Cause you're defenseless, like she was?
[grunting]
May!
May!
[breathing heavily]
Outside, now.
Aah.
He deserves to die, not her!
Agreed.
But right now, Quinn doesn't matter... only Skye does, and I need you to pilot the plane.
You heard what the doctor said.
She said there was nothing more they could do for her, but there are doctors who brought me back from the dead.
If they can do that, I'm betting they can save Skye.
[metal clangs] [monitor beeping]
H.Q. radioed in.
They've ordered us to hand over Quinn for interrogation and transport to the fridge.
Do you want me to arrange the transfer?
No.
Quinn stays in our custody until I say otherwise.
Yes, sir.
Are you sure about this, taking her all the way to Bethesda?
It's where my file says I was treated after New York.
I understand, but what makes you think the doctors there will be able to do anything different?
- I know they saved you, but...
- They did a lot more than save me.
It's time you know the truth.
Simmons:
That can't be.
What you're describing...
it's medically impossible.
Except for the fact that I'm standing here... proof that it's not impossible.
And here's more proof... my file, describing how they brought me back... the doctors, the procedures, the drugs.
Sir... it's against the law for us to read this.
- Are you sure?
- I don't care about your clearance level.
I'm ordering you to read it.
"Death and recovery report."
It's only recently that director Fury gave me access to this.
I've gone over it dozens of times.
I need you to decipher the medical parts of it
I didn't understand.
Feel free to reach out to Dr. Streiten.
He should be eager to answer any questions you may have.
Yes, I'm sure I'll have quite a few.
- So, what about Tahiti?
- Turns out, not so magical, just false memories implanted to cover up what was done.
Sir... it says here your heart was perforated, torn in half.
That part of it I understood.
And yet, they managed to heal the damaged tissue completely.
We need to understand how.
- So we can do the same for Skye.
- That's what I'm counting on.
- We'll get right on it, sir.
- Thank you.
[sighs]
- Hurt much?
- I'm fine.
Coulson told me how long he was dead.
But you already knew that, didn't you?
I saw Skye... in the pod, machines filtering her blood, breathing for her.
I'm not sure I'd make this play... fly halfway around the world hoping for a second miracle.
If Coulson thinks there's a chance in a million to save Skye, to save any of us, he'd take it.
People like us...
we need people like him.
So, yeah, it makes sense... a lot more sense than the alternative.
- You mean giving up?
- Or killing the man responsible.
I did like seeing you go after Quinn.
You don't open the blinds like that very often.
Woman:
S.H.I.E.L.D. 616, this is tower Michael Tango.
You are in violation of S.H.I.E.L.D. directive 1297.
- Respond immediately.
- Disobeying a direct order.
We didn't hand Quinn over for interrogation.
Great.
[engines roar]
This is S.H.I.E.L.D. 616.
How do we proceed?
Prepare to be boarded and relinquish command.
Really?
All the war and chaos in the world, and S.H.I.E.L.D. sends a plane after us?
Three planes...
a small transport to dock and a pair of F-35s to make sure we hand over Quinn.
[thud] [whirring]
If they scratched my paint, I'm gonna be pissed.
I'll await your orders, sir.
Garrett?
What the hell are you doing here?
Well, as opposed to the level 8 jackass I'm staring at,
- I still follow orders.
- You're the worst at following orders.
Maybe... but I like this one.
You are to immediately turn Ian Quinn over for transport to the fridge.
Agent Antoine Triplett, Agent Phillip Coulson.
You wouldn't know it to look at him, but Phil's one of our finest.
An honor, sir.
Trip joined me as my specialist after Ward came to your circus.
- Go secure the prisoner.
- Yes, sir.
Phil, come on.
Just because Fury gave you this pretty plane doesn't mean they won't shoot it out of the sky.
Why are you really here, Garrett?
S.H.I.E.L.D. could have sent any security team to collect Quinn.
Why you?
- You've been chasing him, too!
- Since Malta.
Then yesterday, your little Italian job cost my team weeks of work.
- You can't have him, not yet.
- This isn't a request.
Quinn shot one of my agents.
She's on life support in a med pod downstairs.
We are taking her to the trauma center in Bethesda.
Quinn actually pulled the trigger?
Skye infiltrated his compound in Malta.
When he saw her yesterday, seems he took it personally.
I never took him for a triggerman.
He pays others for that.
I've lost three of my own chasing him.
Then you understand why I can't give him to you until we save my agent.
Because if she doesn't make it...
- Agent Grant Ward.
- Trip. [chuckles]
- Is Garrett upstairs?
- Yeah.
You know, he still talks about that thousand-yard shot you took in Bandung.
It was 2,000.
So, what are you doing here?
- Man, this is like the Playboy jet.
- Mm. [chuckles]
I mean, a guy could get soft bunking in a space like this.
How did Coulson swing such a sweet ride?
- He died.
- That's tight.
You want to point me to the box you're keeping Quinn?
H.Q. ordered Garrett to haul his ass to the fridge for questioning.
[breathes sharply]
- Is that a full bar?
- You're welcome to it.
But, uh, Quinn stays put till Coulson says otherwise.
Come on, man.
Garrett was your S.O., too, so you know how this works.
- Why don't you remind me?
- Garrett wants Quinn.
It's my job to make sure Garrett gets what he wants.
- Now where is he?
- Can't help you with that.
No worries.
I'll find Quinn myself.
I'm sure he's tucked between the jacuzzi and the squash court.
Hey.
[both grunting]
Agent Ward, stand down.
[coughs]
Agent Garrett and I have come to an agreement.
He convinced H.Q. he could interrogate Quinn here on our plane as we continue to Bethesda.
Well, I'm a bit of a sweet talker when I need to be.
You wouldn't believe what I could talk this son of a gun into.
- Good seeing you, son.
- You, too, sir.
And thank you.
Saving the girl's top priority, and she might know something.
I've never heard of half the drugs they gave Coulson...
GH-325?
And what about this robotic-assisted-neural-micro-surgery they used to implant the Tahiti memories?
- It all sounds so diabolical.
- I agree.
We can't argue with the results.
He's walking around.
Yeah but at what cost?
You read the transcripts.
He begged the doctors to let him die.
This is different.
Skye's still alive.
We have to keep her that way.
[cellphone vibrates]
Oh.
I've asked Dr. Streiten to advise us.
[beep] Hello.
Yes.
Are you sure?
That can't be.
[door opens]
And here I thought I was gonna get to play bad cop.
Ian Quinn, this is Agent Garrett.
- He's here to ask you some questions.
- Oh, no, thank you.
I... my head's still ringing from the last visitor.
At least the last visitor left you with a head.
I'm not always that considerate.
I'm interested in one of your newer projects.
Hmm?
Oh, but there are so many to choose from.
[grunts]
Let me be clear... you have no rights.
You have no lawyer.
The only thing keeping Agent Coulson here from throwing you out of this plane is the very weak heartbeat of a young agent downstairs, and the only incentive I have for not tearing your tongue out is that you use it to answer my questions.
Is that clear?
[mumbling] Mm-hmm.
- You understand that?
- No.
[groans]
Aah.
Ohh.
Tell us about Cybertek and the Deathlok program.
- Deathlok?
- Catchy, right?
Sounds like some wrestler from the '80s.
What is it really?
Those are dangerous waters, and the last agent that waded into them wound up with two in the stomach.
[grunting]
So... she's still alive?
Yeah.
And you better hope she stays that way.
Is that why you shot Skye, because she saw what Cybertek delivered?
No.
I shot Skye because that's what the Clairvoyant told me to do.
May:
You wanted to see me?
I just got off the phone with the trauma center in Bethesda.
Dr. Streiten's gone off the grid.
So we'll find a different doctor there who operated on Coulson.
- That's the thing.
Actually...
- Coulson was never treated there.
- You're not making sense.
- None of this makes sense.
The doctors listed, the operating-room number... none of them exist.
None of them are part of S.H.I.E.L.D.
What I find surprising is how a big-shot billionaire could fall for this psychic mumbo jumbo.
Oh, I doubted it at the beginning, but then I realized it would be mutually beneficial.
He must have something pretty terrible on you.
Shooting an unarmed girl?
Let's just say I learned the hard way that obeying was in my best interest.
Yet... here you are.
Let me assure you it wasn't luck that led me to your partner's black sedan in Berlin or that he'd open the door for a redhead or those two agents in Morocco.
Do you think it was just a roll of the dice that my people found them in that Riad?
No, it was the Clairvoyant.
Your Clairvoyant say anything about me knocking your teeth in?
The Clairvoyant sees everything except what happened to him.
This is still about me.
Wait.
You're gonna need to rewind the tape, Phil.
You heard about my near-death before the battle of New York?
There's more to it than that.
I thought I was gone for seconds...
- turns out it was days.
- That's impossible.
Which is why the Clairvoyant will do anything to know how it happened.
- Even order you to shoot Skye.
- Garrett:
Wait.
You don't know what S.H.I.E.L.D. did to save you.
That's why we're flying to where I was treated.
So shooting the girl forces you to figure it all out.
- So the Clairvoyant can finally see.
- Or you let the girl die.
[sighs]
[engine roars]
Quinn shot Skye for nothing.
The place we were going, the doctors who treated you...
- they don't exist.
- Or maybe they exist somewhere else.
This is S.H.I.E.L.D. There are always secrets.
That's my fear, sir.
Your file is filled with secrets... experimental drugs, unknown surgical procedures we've never even heard of.
Frankly, Fitz and I only understand about 70% of what's in here.
Even if we do find where they treated you and we were able to replicate the procedure, there's the other obvious question.
- Which is?
- Whether we should.
What you experienced, sir, if this file is even partially accurate...
No one's suggesting that we submit Skye to everything that I went through, but if there's something in here... a drug, a treatment that can save her, we need to find it.
- Figure it out.
- Yes, sir.
- You disagree.
- No.
I think we need to do everything humanly possible to save Skye.
But we need to acknowledge that doing so might give the Clairvoyant exactly what he wants.
It's a risk we have to take.
[sighs] [monitor beeping]
How is she?
Deteriorating, and I don't know how to stop it.
The only thing I've found remotely interesting
- is something called "GH-325."
- Some kind of drug?
Agent Coulson was injected with that, and literally minutes later, his wounds showed signs of cellular regeneration.
Regeneration?
Is that even possible?
Even if this miracle drug does exist, we don't know where to find it.
We have no coordinates, no logs of anyone's departure or arrival.
I think maybe I can help with that.
- You've set up the echo-chamber.
- Yeah, I made a couple of calls.
A buddy of mine works in the archives at the Triskelion.
Agreed to let us access it from here.
Hard to believe, but this cube contains all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s historical administrative data.
Yeah, but if Agent Coulson's operation didn't take place at a S.H.I.E.L.D. medical facility...
We won't find any record of it here...
I know.
But this also contains all interoffice memos, travel arrangements, purchase orders.
Maybe we can track down the location through a virtual paper trail of some sort or another.
Yeah. [beeping] [gasps] [sighs] Okay.
Well, let's start with the travel memoranda from the date Coulson got stabbed.
[beeping]
Here we go.
Or, um, what about Dr. Streiten's departure from the Triskelion?
- Maybe they have that.
- Yeah.
- Here.
This is interesting.
- A World War II bunker?
"Collapsed" bunker.
Definitely not a sanctioned S.H.I.E.L.D. facility.
- "The Guest House"?
- Exactly.
Guest House...
G.H. GH-325.
Look at the file's access history.
- The only record of it being opened...
- Is by a level 10 operative.
Director Fury.
So, Fury's been to this place, and he's the person who sanctioned the operations on Agent Coulson.
And why aren't you trying to find the file?
[beeping]
Ah, damn.
Encrypted.
Skye could crack this.
What would she do?
It's not an encryption.
[engine roars]
The Guest House is not a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility.
We don't know who or what's in there.
- Be prepared for potential resistance.
- No contact from inside?
May:
I've tried every known channel... no response.
- Place could be abandoned.
- Let's hope not.
We need the people inside to work on Skye.
Simmons is prepping Skye to move at a moment's notice, sir.
Trip can help.
He's had med-tech training.
Good.
We do our jobs right, this will all go peacefully.
- What if they don't want to help us?
- I'll say "pretty please."
We need the doctors alive and the place intact.
If it does go sideways, Fitz, I need you down there to determine what Simmons can use to help Skye.
And then we take it.
Let's move.
[tone plays]
Alpha:
Company?
Nothing's scheduled for a couple weeks.
Try the protocol.
Alpha:
How was the drive from Istanbul?
- Countersign?
- No clue.
- Never heard it.
- Fitz:
I can't find it in any of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s protocol directives.
This is Agent Coulson with S.H.I.E.L.D.
We don't know the counter, but we have a team member in dire need of medical assistance.
We know she can be treated here.
Open the doors.
Maybe we can work something out.
Do you copy?
How was the drive from Istanbul?
We're looking for medical assistance.
A person's life is at stake.
Will you help us?
How was the drive from Istanbul?
"Pretty please" it is.
These guys are good...
hacked their way in.
How the hell did they find this place?
Doesn't matter.
Didn't know the countersign.
- You want left or right?
- Left's good.
[elevator bell dings]
There's an antechamber and a set of glass doors.
Can't see much beyond that.
Lights are all out.
Well, they know we're coming.
Let's go say "hello."
Clear.
Okay, Simmons, we're going in now.
Simmons?
Damn it.
Comms are down.
There's too much mountain on top of us.
Trust me... it's better.
You don't want them hearing the horrible death we're walking into.
Humor, son.
You Brits are too serious.
- Besides, if the job was easy...
- It wouldn't be any fun.
I'm not afraid... not yet.
I suspect the real danger won't happen until we breach that bulletproof glass.
Probably a stairwell back to the surface.
What do you think, Fitz?
Can you get us inside?
To certain, horrible death?
Absolutely.
Okay, sir, just say the word.
Once we get inside, everybody find cover.
All right, gentlemen, here we go.
[beep]
We've come for medical assistance.
But you continue firing on us, we will defend oursel...
- I count two hostiles.
- Copy that.
Ready?
You got one of those little flash things?
Yeah.
Ward!
[groans]
Clear!
- See if you can get some lights on.
- Yeah.
[sighs]
No hard feelings, Bob.
Clear.
We're not done.
This one's hit.
Shouldn't be too hard to find.
[music]
Coulson:
Go.
We're gonna get you medical help.
Is anyone else down here?
Where are the doctors?
Med staff doesn't stay here.
We're looking for a drug...
GH-325.
It might help you, too.
- Do I... k-know you?
- I don't know.
I-I might have spent some time here awhile back.
Then you know about... the timer.
Garret:
We got a problem!
[breathes sharply]
Semtex.
The whole place is rigged to blow.
Fitz:
There's enough explosive to bring down the whole mountain on top of us.
Sir.
Less than 10 minutes.
It's probably a failsafe.
If the guards had eliminated us, they'd stop the timer.
Since they didn't...
Fitz:
It's some kind of emergency override.
Skye could probably get past it, but I can't hack the panel, which means we're trapped in here.
You're the guy who taught Ward how to disarm nuclear bombs.
Figure out a way to get us out of here.
Let's go find the drug.
So this is some sort of medical facility.
Yeah, but if nobody's here, I'm not sure it's gonna do us any good.
[monitor beeping]
Tough when it's your team.
You guys go back a ways?
Not really.
A few months.
We have nothing in common...
couldn't be more different.
But you can't imagine your life without her.
Yes.
You've experienced that, Agent Triplett?
I have.
Sometimes, a person takes you by surprise.
Yeah.
She's very lucky to have you.
I know anything bad ever happens to me, hope you're in my corner, too.
[footsteps approach]
May:
Comms are down.
If I don't hear anything within the hour, I'm going after them.
[rapid beeping]
Skye's coding.
Both of you, now.
[flatline]
How can we help?
I need a unit of Epi.
Got it.
Don't.
Let me die.
Please.
Let me die!
- Is that where...
- Yeah.
The timer doesn't control the explosion.
It's just a clock.
Detonator must be somewhere else.
It's not in here, or I'd have found it.
There's no time to search the whole compound.
Maybe we can take some semtex, use it on the doors.
Sir, are you sure you want to?
We should put suits on before we go in there.
You're right, but there's no time.
I wish I could speak to Simmons.
She'd know what most of this stuff is... or, at least, what stuff not to touch.
Uh...
Fitz.
Oh.
I don't see any G.H...
Agent Coulson.
It's locked.
Here.
Put these on.
Got it.
Time to go.
We couldn't stop it.
Four minutes and counting.
Almost there.
There's semtex throughout here, as well.
This is it... 325.
- This is the one we want.
- We gotta go.
- Get it up to Simmons.
- Yeah.
Sir.
I'll be right behind you.
Go.
Three minutes.
Have you worked much with munitions, Agent Fitz?
Explosives are a fascinating specialty... very exacting.
Too big a concussion could trigger a chain reaction... bury us like fossils for a thousand years.
Guess we don't have to worry about the Clairvoyant finding this place.
Agent Ward...
would you do the honors?
Ward:
Thought you'd never ask.
[gun cocks]
Can you slip through?
- Yeah [grunts]
- Go.
All right.
Get that drug up there.
- Coulson.
- Where the hell is he?
Phil!
Go with Fitz.
Make sure that drug gets to the girl.
- Agent Garrett.
- Go!
Save the girl.
Simmons:
Weak, erratic heart rate.
Each time we save her, I ask myself, "is this what Skye would want?"
We didn't come this far to quit.
Fitz:
Get off... [static] the ground immediately.
They're alive.
Maybe we can... [flatline] Fitz, come in.
What's your status?
[breathing sharply]
Garrett:
Phil!
Phil, what the hell?
Clock's not slowing down.
- It's about to get really warm in here.
- Hey, you with me?
The guys are out already.
They took the drug up to Skye.
No, don't give it to her.
The drug... they can't give it to her!
All right.
You can tell them yourself.
Right now, we just need to get out of this mountain and off the ground.
Now let's go.
[flatline]
You want more epinephrine?
- We found it.
- What is it?
And how much, injected where?
May, get us off the ground, or it'll fall out from under us.
[whirring]
[engine roaring]
No!
Don't give it to her!
[flatline]
I was losing her, anyway.
What harm can it do?
[monitor beeping]
Come on, girl.
Garrett:
It's working.
[rapid beeping] Simmons:
She's spiking.
Stop it.
How can we stop it?
Skye!
- What's happening?
- [crying] I don't know...
Skye!
[grunting]
Fitz:
Do something...
we have to do something!
[gasping]
[beeping slows]
Her heartbeat... she's stabilizing.
Simmons?
[sighs]
Could someone tell me what we just saw?
The girl's a fighter.
What was that stuff you just gave her?
I don't know.
All I know is that it worked.
You're a real miracle worker.
You did it.
Something happen down there?
I'm not sure.
One minute, he was fine.
The next, it was like he had seen a ghost.
I have good news and bad news.
Which would you like to hear first?
[door closes]
Bad news, then...
there's a fair amount.
Your Clairvoyant, the one who said he'd have your back... he's a no-show.
The site we were supposed to lead him to with our minds... blown to pieces, buried under 100 feet of rock.
It seems the only psychic power your buddy has shown is the ability to predict if you tell tell a rich, entitled dirtbag he's gonna get away with murder, he'll believe it.
Trip.
Girl's gonna live... live to testify how a billionaire shot her point-blank in the stomach.
Oh, we got a great little home movie of you admitting that, genius.
This Clairvoyant played you and left you to rot.
- You said there was good news.
- I did?
Oh, yeah.
You still have your tongue.
[scoffs]
Let's go.
I want to thank you, Garrett, for letting us keep Quinn on the plane.
Don't mention it.
There's still time for me to make the rest of his life a long, living hell.
I'm counting on it.
- Something I need to ask you, Phil.
- Of course.
- We've known each other a long time.
- Yes, we have.
Been in our share of tight spots together.
If it had gone the other way...
if Skye hadn't survived, were you really prepared to throw Quinn off this plane?
You were the one who made that threat.
I just asked to keep him on the plane for awhile.
You're right.
It was me.
- My mistake.
- Till next time.
Might be sooner than you think.
My man Trip's got eyes for that biotech gal of yours.
[whirring]
Do you mind?
You did the impossible today.
You saved Skye's life.
Why aren't you happy about it?
[sighs]
They told me you were yelling...
to not use the drug, to not use it on Skye.
Why?
What made you change your mind?
[whirring]
[gasps]
Phil?
Phil!
You all right?
Being down there... seeing where I came from...
I just got really scared that she would suffer the way that I did.
But she didn't.
For whatever reason...
she didn't.
Coulson: "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D." will return in a moment.
Nicole:
I'm gonna go see if they have a map.
I'll be waiting in the car, Mrs. Mackenzie.
[chuckles]
[panting]
- Are you okay?
- [sighs] No.
No, I'm parched and weary.
Is all of Midgard so desolate?
Midgard?
I don't know where that is.
- This is Death Valley.
- Oh.
I seek passage from this...
valley of death to a more bountiful land.
I wish I could help, but...
it's built for two.
Y-you should ask the manager inside.
Uh, maybe there's a bus later today.
- She's your bride?
- Yep, since yesterday morning.
And you prefer her to me?
Well... yeah.
I prefer Nicole to pretty much everyone.
That's why I married her...
together forever.
[chuckles]
Loyalty...
I admire that in a man.
[echoing] I am going to need your help...
if I am to remain free.
[engine revs]
Jimmy!
I swear to protect you and keep you safe, but I don't even know your name.
It's Lorelei.
My name is Lorelei.
Previously on "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...
WhywouldS.H.I.E.L.D. keep details of your death from you?
What happened in Tahiti?
Director Fury ...
He had a team of scientists working around the clock
- I wanted to die.
- And we should have let you.
Once we capture Quinn, we'll be one step closer to the Clairvoyant.
- Where's Skye?
- Agent Coulson, it's dangerous... sending her in like that, all alone.
Oh.
Oh, god.
Hang on.
- Put her in there!
- Is it working?
!
We need to get her to a medical facility and fast.
1x14
- T.A.H.I.T.I.
She was shot twice in the abdomen at close range almost two hours ago.
She's tachycardic, hypotensive, and lost a significant amount of blood.
We had to lower her core body temp in order to transport her here.
It's probably what kept her alive this long.
We'll do everything we can.
- Oh, dear.
I'm a mess.
- No.
You were great.
Intubate, and let's start getting that shirt off.
Okay, let's prep her for ex-lap.
I'm here.
That's unacceptable.
I need to speak to Director Fury immediately, please.
Why didn't I stop her?
- I could have.
- As if you could stop Skye doing anything she's set her mind to.
I shouldn't have let her go after Quinn by herself.
What was I thinking?
It's not your fault.
She shouldn't have been there.
I'm her S.O. It's on me.
The one to blame is the man who shot her, Ian Quinn.
He's responsible.
Yes, the message is, I have an agent dying, and there are questions only he can answer.
- How is she?
- Not good.
The shots perforated her stomach and penetrated the large and small intestines.
We resected what we could, but...
- there's been too much damage.
- So what's next?
We can keep her comfortable, but you'll need to make a decision on whether or not you want to keep her on life support.
You're saying there's nothing to be done?
I'm saying you need to call her family and get them here as soon as possible.
We're her family.
In that case, I'm very sorry.
Finally.
I was beginning to think you'd forgotten ...
Ohh.
Wait!
You can't!
Why?
'Cause you're defenseless, like she was?
May!
May!
Outside, now.
He deserves to die, not her!
Agreed.
But right now, Quinn doesn't matter ... only Skye does, and I need you to pilot the plane.
You heard what the doctor said.
She said there was nothing more they could do for her, but there are doctors who brought me back from the dead.
If they can do that, I'm betting they can save Skye.
H.Q. radioed in.
They've ordered us to hand over Quinn for interrogation and transport to the fridge.
Do you want me to arrange the transfer?
No.
Quinn stays in our custody until I say otherwise.
Yes, sir.
Are you sure about this, taking her all the way to Bethesda?
It's where my file says I was treated after New York.
I understand, but what makes you think the doctors there will be able to do anything different?
- I know they saved you, but ...
- They did a lot more than save me.
It's time you know the truth.
That can't be.
What you're describing ...
it's medically impossible.
Except for the fact that I'm standing here ... proof that it's not impossible.
And here's more proof ... my file, describing how they brought me back ... the doctors, the procedures, the drugs.
Sir... it's against the law for us to read this.
- Are you sure?
- I don't care about your clearance level.
I'm ordering you to read it.
"Death and recovery report."
It's only recently that director Fury gave me access to this.
I've gone over it dozens of times.
I need you to decipher the medical parts of it
I didn't understand.
Feel free to reach out to Dr. Streiten.
He should be eager to answer any questions you may have.
Yes, I'm sure I'll have quite a few.
- So, what about Tahiti?
- Turns out, not so magical, just false memories implanted to cover up what was done.
Sir... it says here your heart was perforated, torn in half.
That part of it I understood.
And yet, they managed to heal the damaged tissue completely.
We need to understand how.
- So we can do the same for Skye.
- That's what I'm counting on.
- We'll get right on it, sir.
- Thank you.
- Hurt much?
- I'm fine.
Coulson told me how long he was dead.
But you already knew that, didn't you?
I saw Skye... in the pod, machines filtering her blood, breathing for her.
I'm not sure I'd make this play ... fly halfway around the world hoping for a second miracle.
If Coulson thinks there's a chance in a million to save Skye, to save any of us, he'd take it.
People like us ...
we need people like him.
So, yeah, it makes sense ... a lot more sense than the alternative.
- You mean giving up?
- Or killing the man responsible.
I did like seeing you go after Quinn.
You don't open the blinds like that very often.
S.H.I.E.L.D. 616, this is tower Michael Tango.
You are in violation of S.H.I.E.L.D. directive 1297.
- Respond immediately.
- Disobeying a direct order.
We didn't hand Quinn over for interrogation.
Great.
This is S.H.I.E.L.D. 616.
How do we proceed?
Prepare to be boarded and relinquish command.
Really?
All the war and chaos in the world, and S.H.I.E.L.D. sends a plane after us?
Three planes ...
a small transport to dock and a pair of F-35s to make sure we hand over Quinn.
If they scratched my paint, I'm gonna be pissed.
I'll await your orders, sir.
Garrett?
What the hell are you doing here?
Well, as opposed to the level 8 jackass I'm staring at,
- I still follow orders.
- You're the worst at following orders.
Maybe... but I like this one.
You are to immediately turn Ian Quinn over for transport to the fridge.
Agent Antoine Triplett, Agent Phillip Coulson.
You wouldn't know it to look at him, but Phil's one of our finest.
An honor, sir.
Trip joined me as my specialist after Ward came to your circus.
- Go secure the prisoner.
- Yes, sir.
Phil, come on.
Just because Fury gave you this pretty plane doesn't mean they won't shoot it out of the sky.
Why are you really here, Garrett?
S.H.I.E.L.D. could have sent any security team to collect Quinn.
Why you?
- You've been chasing him, too!
- Since Malta.
Then yesterday, your little Italian job cost my team weeks of work.
- You can't have him, not yet.
- This isn't a request.
Quinn shot one of my agents.
She's on life support in a med pod downstairs.
We are taking her to the trauma center in Bethesda.
Quinn actually pulled the trigger?
Skye infiltrated his compound in Malta.
When he saw her yesterday, seems he took it personally.
I never took him for a triggerman.
He pays others for that.
I've lost three of my own chasing him.
Then you understand why I can't give him to you until we save my agent.
Because if she doesn't make it...
- Agent Grant Ward.
- Trip.
- Is Garrett upstairs?
- Yeah.
You know, he still talks about that thousand-yard shot you took in Bandung.
It was 2,000.
So, what are you doing here?
Man, this is like the Playboy jet.
I mean, a guy could get soft bunking in a space like this.
How did Coulson swing such a sweet ride?
- He died.
- That's tight.
You want to point me to the box you're keeping Quinn?
H.Q. ordered Garrett to haul his ass to the fridge for questioning.
- Is that a full bar?
- You're welcome to it.
But, uh, Quinn stays put till Coulson says otherwise.
Come on, man.
Garrett was your S.O., too, so you know how this works.
- Why don't you remind me?
- Garrett wants Quinn.
It's my job to make sure Garrett gets what he wants.
- Now where is he?
- Can't help you with that.
No worries.
I'll find Quinn myself.
I'm sure he's tucked between the jacuzzi and the squash court.
Hey.
Agent Ward, stand down.
Agent Garrett and I have come to an agreement.
He convinced H.Q. he could interrogate Quinn here on our plane as we continue to Bethesda.
Well, I'm a bit of a sweet talker when I need to be.
You wouldn't believe what I could talk this son of a gun into.
- Good seeing you, son.
- You, too, sir.
And thank you.
Saving the girl's top priority, and she might know something.
I've never heard of half the drugs they gave Coulson ...
GH-325?
And what about this robotic-assisted- neural-micro-surgery they used to implant the Tahiti memories?
- It all sounds so diabolical.
- I agree.
We can't argue with the results.
He's walking around.
Yeah but at what cost?
You read the transcripts.
He begged the doctors to let him die.
This is different.
Skye's still alive.
We have to keep her that way.
Oh.
I've asked Dr. Streiten to advise us.
Hello.
Yes.
Are you sure?
That can't be.
And here I thought I was gonna get to play bad cop.
Ian Quinn, this is Agent Garrett.
- He's here to ask you some questions.
- Oh, no, thank you.
I ... my head's still ringing from the last visitor.
At least the last visitor left you with a head.
I'm not always that considerate.
I'm interested in one of your newer projects.
Hmm?
Oh, but there are so many to choose from.
Let me be clear ... you have no rights.
You have no lawyer.
The only thing keeping Agent Coulson here from throwing you out of this plane is the very weak heartbeat of a young agent downstairs, and the only incentive I have for not tearing your tongue out is that you use it to answer my questions.
Is that clear?
Mm-hmm.
- You understand that?
- No.
Tell us about Cybertek and the Deathlok program.
- Deathlok?
- Catchy, right?
Sounds like some wrestler from the '80s.
What is it really?
Those are dangerous waters, and the last agent that waded into them wound up with two in the stomach.
So... she's still alive?
Yeah.
And you better hope she stays that way.
Is that why you shot Skye, because she saw what Cybertek delivered?
No.
I shot Skye because that's what the Clairvoyant told me to do.
You wanted to see me?
I just got off the phone with the trauma center in Bethesda.
Dr. Streiten's gone off the grid.
So we'll find a different doctor there who operated on Coulson.
- That's the thing.
Actually...
- Coulson was never treated there.
- You're not making sense.
- None of this makes sense.
The doctors listed, the operating-room number ... none of them exist.
None of them are part of S.H.I.E.L.D.
What I find surprising is how a big-shot billionaire could fall for this psychic mumbo jumbo.
Oh, I doubted it at the beginning, but then I realized it would be mutually beneficial.
He must have something pretty terrible on you.
Shooting an unarmed girl?
Let's just say I learned the hard way that obeying was in my best interest.
Yet... here you are.
Let me assure you it wasn't luck that led me to your partner's black sedan in Berlin or that he'd open the door for a redhead or those two agents in Morocco.
Do you think it was just a roll of the dice that my people found them in that Riad?
No, it was the Clairvoyant.
Your Clairvoyant say anything about me knocking your teeth in?
The Clairvoyant sees everything except what happened to him.
This is still about me.
Wait.
You're gonna need to rewind the tape, Phil.
You heard about my near-death before the battle of New York?
There's more to it than that.
I thought I was gone for seconds ...
- turns out it was days.
- That's impossible.
Which is why the Clairvoyant will do anything to know how it happened.
- Even order you to shoot Skye.
- Wait.
You don't know what S.H.I.E.L.D. did to save you.
That's why we're flying to where I was treated.
So shooting the girl forces you to figure it all out.
- So the Clairvoyant can finally see.
- Or you let the girl die.
Quinn shot Skye for nothing.
The place we were going, the doctors who treated you ...
- they don't exist.
- Or maybe they exist somewhere else.
This is S.H.I.E.L.D. There are always secrets.
That's my fear, sir.
Your file is filled with secrets ... experimental drugs, unknown surgical procedures we've never even heard of.
Frankly, Fitz and I only understand about 70% of what's in here.
Even if we do find where they treated you and we were able to replicate the procedure, there's the other obvious question.
- Which is?
- Whether we should.
What you experienced, sir, if this file is even partially accurate ...
No one's suggesting that we submit Skye to everything that I went through, but if there's something in here ... a drug, a treatment that can save her, we need to find it.
- Figure it out.
- Yes, sir.
- You disagree.
- No.
I think we need to do everything humanly possible to save Skye.
But we need to acknowledge that doing so might give the Clairvoyant exactly what he wants.
It's a risk we have to take.
How is she?
Deteriorating, and I don't know how to stop it.
The only thing I've found remotely interesting
- is something called "GH-325."
- Some kind of drug?
Agent Coulson was injected with that, and literally minutes later, his wounds showed signs of cellular regeneration.
Regeneration?
Is that even possible?
Even if this miracle drug does exist, we don't know where to find it.
We have no coordinates, no logs of anyone's departure or arrival.
I think maybe I can help with that.
- You've set up the echo-chamber.
- Yeah, I made a couple of calls.
A buddy of mine works in the archives at the Triskelion.
Agreed to let us access it from here.
Hard to believe, but this cube contains all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s historical administrative data.
Yeah, but if Agent Coulson's operation didn't take place at a S.H.I.E.L.D. medical facility ...
We won't find any record of it here ...
I know.
But this also contains all interoffice memos, travel arrangements, purchase orders.
Maybe we can track down the location through a virtual paper trail of some sort or another.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, let's start with the travel memoranda from the date Coulson got stabbed.
Here we go.
Or, um, what about Dr. Streiten's departure from the Triskelion?
- Maybe they have that.
- Yeah.
- Here.
This is interesting.
- A World War II bunker?
"Collapsed" bunker.
Definitely not a sanctioned S.H.I.E.L.D. facility.
- "The Guest House"?
- Exactly.
Guest House ...
G.H. GH-325.
Look at the file's access history.
- The only record of it being opened...
- Is by a level 10 operative.
Director Fury.
So, Fury's been to this place, and he's the person who sanctioned the operations on Agent Coulson.
And why aren't you trying to find the file?
Ah, damn.
Encrypted.
Skye could crack this.
What would she do?
It's not an encryption.
The Guest House is not a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility.
We don't know who or what's in there.
- Be prepared for potential resistance.
- No contact from inside?
I've tried every known channel ... no response.
- Place could be abandoned.
- Let's hope not.
We need the people inside to work on Skye.
Simmons is prepping Skye to move at a moment's notice, sir.
Trip can help.
He's had med-tech training.
Good.
We do our jobs right, this will all go peacefully.
- What if they don't want to help us?
- I'll say "pretty please."
We need the doctors alive and the place intact.
If it does go sideways, Fitz, I need you down there to determine what Simmons can use to help Skye.
And then we take it.
Let's move.
Company?
Nothing's scheduled for a couple weeks.
Try the protocol.
How was the drive from Istanbul?
- Countersign?
- No clue.
- Never heard it.
- I can't find it in any of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s protocol directives.
This is Agent Coulson with S.H.I.E.L.D.
We don't know the counter, but we have a team member in dire need of medical assistance.
We know she can be treated here.
Open the doors.
Maybe we can work something out.
Do you copy?
How was the drive from Istanbul?
We're looking for medical assistance.
A person's life is at stake.
Will you help us?
How was the drive from Istanbul?
"Pretty please" it is.
These guys are good...
hacked their way in.
How the hell did they find this place?
Doesn't matter.
Didn't know the countersign.
- You want left or right?
- Left's good.
There's an antechamber and a set of glass doors.
Can't see much beyond that.
Lights are all out.
Well, they know we're coming.
Let's go say "hello."
Clear.
Okay, Simmons, we're going in now.
Simmons?
Damn it.
Comms are down.
There's too much mountain on top of us.
Trust me ... it's better.
You don't want them hearing the horrible death we're walking into.
Humor, son.
You Brits are too serious.
- Besides, if the job was easy...
- It wouldn't be any fun.
I'm not afraid ... not yet.
I suspect the real danger won't happen until we breach that bulletproof glass.
Probably a stairwell back to the surface.
What do you think, Fitz?
Can you get us inside?
To certain, horrible death?
Absolutely.
Okay, sir, just say the word.
Once we get inside, everybody find cover.
All right, gentlemen, here we go.
We've come for medical assistance.
But you continue firing on us, we will defend oursel...
- I count two hostiles.
- Copy that.
Ready?
You got one of those little flash things?
Yeah.
Ward!
Clear!
- See if you can get some lights on.
- Yeah.
No hard feelings, Bob.
Clear.
We're not done.
This one's hit.
Shouldn't be too hard to find.
Go.
We're gonna get you medical help.
Is anyone else down here?
Where are the doctors?
Med staff doesn't stay here.
We're looking for a drug ...
GH-325.
It might help you, too.
- Do I... k-know you?
- I don't know.
I-I might have spent some time here awhile back.
Then you know about... the timer.
We got a problem!
Semtex.
The whole place is rigged to blow.
There's enough explosive to bring down the whole mountain on top of us.
Sir.
Less than 10 minutes.
It's probably a failsafe.
If the guards had eliminated us, they'd stop the timer.
Since they didn't...
It's some kind of emergency override.
Skye could probably get past it, but I can't hack the panel, which means we're trapped in here.
You're the guy who taught Ward how to disarm nuclear bombs.
Figure out a way to get us out of here.
Let's go find the drug.
So this is some sort of medical facility.
Yeah, but if nobody's here, I'm not sure it's gonna do us any good.
Tough when it's your team.
You guys go back a ways?
Not really.
A few months.
We have nothing in common ...
couldn't be more different.
But you can't imagine your life without her.
Yes.
You've experienced that, Agent Triplett?
I have.
Sometimes, a person takes you by surprise.
Yeah.
She's very lucky to have you.
I know anything bad ever happens to me, hope you're in my corner, too.
Comms are down.
If I don't hear anything within the hour, I'm going after them.
Skye's coding.
Both of you, now.
How can we help?
I need a unit of Epi.
Got it.
Don't.
Let me die.
Please.
Let me die!
- Is that where...
- Yeah.
The timer doesn't control the explosion.
It's just a clock.
Detonator must be somewhere else.
It's not in here, or I'd have found it.
There's no time to search the whole compound.
Maybe we can take some semtex, use it on the doors.
Sir, are you sure you want to?
We should put suits on before we go in there.
You're right, but there's no time.
I wish I could speak to Simmons.
She'd know what most of this stuff is ... or, at least, what stuff not to touch.
Uh...
Fitz.
Oh.
I don't see any G.H...
Agent Coulson.
It's locked.
Here.
Put these on.
Got it.
Time to go.
We couldn't stop it.
Four minutes and counting.
Almost there.
There's semtex throughout here, as well.
This is it ... 325.
- This is the one we want.
- We gotta go.
- Get it up to Simmons.
- Yeah.
Sir.
I'll be right behind you.
Go.
Three minutes.
Have you worked much with munitions, Agent Fitz?
Explosives are a fascinating specialty ... very exacting.
Too big a concussion could trigger a chain reaction ... bury us like fossils for a thousand years.
Guess we don't have to worry about the Clairvoyant finding this place.
Agent Ward...
would you do the honors?
Thought you'd never ask.
Can you slip through?
- Yeah.
- Go.
All right.
Get that drug up there.
- Coulson.
- Where the hell is he?
Phil!
Go with Fitz.
Make sure that drug gets to the girl.
- Agent Garrett.
- Go!
Save the girl.
Weak, erratic heart rate.
Each time we save her, I ask myself, "is this what Skye would want?"
We didn't come this far to quit.
Getoff...
the ground immediately.
They're alive.
Maybe we can ...
Fitz, come in.
What's your status?
Phil!
Phil, what the hell?
Clock's not slowing down.
- It's about to get really warm in here.
- Hey, you with me?
The guys are out already.
They took the drug up to Skye.
No, don't give it to her.
The drug ... they can't give it to her!
All right.
You can tell them yourself.
Right now, we just need to get out of this mountain and off the ground.
Now let's go.
You want more epinephrine?
- We found it.
- What is it?
And how much, injected where?
May, get us off the ground, or it'll fall out from under us.
No!
Don't give it to her!
I was losing her, anyway.
What harm can it do?
Come on, girl.
It's working.
She'sspiking.
Stop it.
How can we stop it?
Skye!
- What's happening?
- I don't know...
Skye!
Do something ...
we have to do something!
Her heartbeat ... she's stabilizing.
Simmons?
Could someone tell me what we just saw?
The girl's a fighter.
What was that stuff you just gave her?
I don't know.
All I know is that it worked.
You're a real miracle worker.
You did it.
Something happen down there?
I'm not sure.
One minute, he was fine.
The next, it was like he had seen a ghost.
I have good news and bad news.
Which would you like to hear first?
Bad news, then ...
there's a fair amount.
Your Clairvoyant, the one who said he'd have your back ... he's a no-show.
The site we were supposed to lead him to with our minds ... blown to pieces, buried under 100 feet of rock.
It seems the only psychic power your buddy has shown is the ability to predict if you tell tell a rich, entitled dirtbag he's gonna get away with murder, he'll believe it.
Trip.
Girl's gonna live ... live to testify how a billionaire shot her point-blank in the stomach.
Oh, we got a great little home movie of you admitting that, genius.
This Clairvoyant played you and left you to rot.
- You said there was good news.
- I did?
Oh, yeah.
You still have your tongue.
Let's go.
I want to thank you, Garrett, for letting us keep Quinn on the plane.
Don't mention it.
There's still time for me to make the rest of his life a long, living hell.
I'm counting on it.
- Something I need to ask you, Phil.
- Of course.
- We've known each other a long time.
- Yes, we have.
Been in our share of tight spots together.
If it had gone the other way...
if Skye hadn't survived, were you really prepared to throw Quinn off this plane?
You were the one who made that threat.
I just asked to keep him on the plane for awhile.
You're right.
It was me.
- My mistake.
- Till next time.
Might be sooner than you think.
My man Trip's got eyes for that biotech gal of yours.
Do you mind?
You did the impossible today.
You saved Skye's life.
Why aren't you happy about it?
They told me you were yelling...
to not use the drug, to not use it on Skye.
Why?
What made you change your mind?
Phil?
Phil!
You all right?
Being down there... seeing where I came from...
I just got really scared that she would suffer the way that I did.
But she didn't.
For whatever reason...
she didn't.
"Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D." will return in a moment.
I'm gonna go see if they have a map.
I'll be waiting in the car, Mrs. Mackenzie.
- Are you okay?
- No.
No, I'm parched and weary.
Is all of Midgard so desolate?
Midgard?
I don't know where that is.
- This is Death Valley.
- Oh.
I seek passage from this...
valley of death to a more bountiful land.
I wish I could help,but...
it's built for two.
Y-you should ask the manager inside.
Uh, maybe there's a bus later today.
- She's your bride?
- Yep, since yesterday morning.
And you prefer her to me?
Well... yeah.
I prefer Nicole to pretty much everyone.
That's why I married her ...
together forever.
Loyalty ...
I admire that in a man.
I am going to need your help...
if I am to remain free.
Jimmy!
I swear to protect you and keep you safe, but I don't even know your name.
It's Lorelei.
My name is Lorelei.
Previously on Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D...
Why would S.H.I.E.L.D. keep details of your death from you?
What happened in Tahiti?
Director Fury.
He had a team of scientists working around the clock.
- I wanted to die.
- And we should have let you.
Once we capture Quinn, we'll be one step closer to The Clairvoyant.
- Where's Skye?
- Agent Coulson, it's dangerous sending her in like that, all alone.
Oh, God.
Hang on.
Put her in there.
Is it working?
We need to get her to a medical facility, and fast.
She was shot twice in the abdomen at close range almost two hours ago.
She's tachycardia, hypotensive, and lost a significant amount of blood.
We had to lower her core body temp in order to transport her here.
That's probably what kept her alive this long.
We'll do everything we can.
Oh, dear, I'm a mess.
No, you were great.
Intubate and let's start getting that shirt off.
Here.
Good, block it off.
- We need two liters standing by.
- Good.
100 eds.
- It's ready.
- Okay, let's prep her for ex-lap.
It's in.
- Fluids wide open.
- All set.
Patient is ready, Doctor.
I'm here.
That's unacceptable.
I need to speak to Director Fury immediately, please.
Why didn't I stop her?
I could've.
As if you could stop Skye doing anything she set her mind to.
I shouldn't have let her go after Quinn by herself.
- What was I thinking?
- It's not your fault.
She shouldn't have been there.
I'm her S.O. It's on me.
The one to blame is the man who shot her.
Ian Quinn.
He's responsible.
Yes, the message is I have an agent dying and there are questions only he can answer.
- How is she?
- Not good.
The shots perforated her stomach and penetrated the large and small intestines.
We resected what we could, but there's been too much damage.
- So what's next?
- We can keep her comfortable, but you'll need to make a decision on whether or not you wanna keep her on life-support.
You're saying there's nothing to be done?
I'm saying you need to call her family.
Get them here as soon as possible.
We're her family.
In that case, I'm very sorry.
Finally.
I was beginning to think...
Oh!
Wait!
You can't!
Why?
Because you're defenseless?
Like she was?
May!
Outside.
Now.
He deserves to die.
Not her.
Agreed.
But right now, Quinn doesn't matter.
Only Skye does and I need you to pilot the plane.
You heard what the doctor said.
She said there was nothing more they could do for her.
But there are doctors who brought me back from the dead.
If they can do that, I'm betting they can save Skye.
H.Q. radioed in.
They've ordered us to hand over Quinn for interrogation and transport to the Fridge.
You want me to arrange the transfer?
No.
Quinn stays in our custody until I say otherwise.
Yes, sir.
You sure about this?
Taking her all the way to Bethesda?
It's where my file says I was treated after New York.
I understand, but what makes you think the doctors there will be able to do anything different?
I know they saved you...
They did a lot more than save me.
It's time you know the truth.
That can't be.
What you're describing...
It's medically impossible.
Except for the fact that I'm standing here.
Proof that it's not impossible.
And here's more proof.
My file.
Describing how they brought me back.
The doctors, the procedures, the drugs.
Sir, it's against the law for us to read this.
Are you sure...
I don't care about your clearance level.
I'm ordering you to read it.
"Death and Recovery Report."
It's only recently that Director Fury gave me access to this.
I've gone over it dozens of times.
I need you to decipher the medical parts of it I didn't understand.
Feel free to reach out to Dr. Streiten.
He should be eager to answer any questions you may have.
Yes, I'm sure I'll have quite a few.
So, what about Tahiti?
Turns out, not so magical.
Just false memories, implanted to cover up what was done.
Sir, it says here your heart was perforated.
Torn in half.
That part of it, I understood.
And yet they managed to heal the damaged tissue completely.
We need to understand how.
So we can do the same for Skye.
That's what I'm counting on.
- We'll get right on it, sir.
- Thank you.
Hurt much?
I'm fine.
Coulson told me how long he was dead.
You already knew that, didn't you?
I saw Skye in the pod.
Machines filtering her blood, breathing for her.
I'm not sure I'd make this play.
Fly halfway around the world hoping for a second miracle.
If Coulson thinks there's a chance in a million to save Skye, to save any of us, he'd take it.
People like us, we need people like him.
So, yeah, it makes sense.
A lot more sense than the alternative.
You mean giving up?
Killing the man responsible.
I did like seeing you go after Quinn.
You don't open the blinds like that very often.
WOMAN".
S.H.I.E.L.D. 616, this is Tower Michael Tango.
You are in violation of S.H.I.E.L.D. Directive 1297.
Respond immediately.
Disobeying a direct order.
We didn't hand Quinn over for interrogation.
Great.
This is S.H.I.E.L.D. 616.
How do we proceed?
WOMAN".
Prepare to be boarded and relinquish command.
Really?
All the war and chaos in the world and S.H.I.E.L.D. sends a plane after us?
Three planes.
A small transport to dock and a pair of F-35s to make sure we hand over Quinn.
They scratch my paint, I'm gonna be pissed.
I'll await your orders, sir.
Garrett?
What the hell are you doing here?
Well, as opposed to the Level eight jackass I'm staring at,
I still follow orders.
You're the worst at following orders.
Maybe, but I like this one.
You are to immediately turn Ian Quinn over for transport to the Fridge.
Agent Antoine Triplett, Agent Philip Coulson.
You wouldn't know it to look at him, but Phil's one of our finest.
An honor, sir.
Trip joined me as my specialist after Ward came to your circus.
- Go secure the prisoner.
- Yes, sir.
Phil, come on.
Just because Fury gave you this pretty plane, doesn't mean they won't shoot it out of the sky.
Why are you really here, Garrett?
S.H.I.E.L.D could've sent any security team to collect Quinn.
Why you?
You've been chasing him, too?
Since Malta.
Then yesterday, your little Italian job cost my team weeks of work.
You can't have him.
Not yet.
This isn't a request.
Quinn shot one of my agents.
She's on life-support in a med pod downstairs.
We're taking her to the trauma center in Bethesda.
Quinn actually pulled the trigger?
Skye infiltrated his compound in Malta.
When he saw her yesterday, it seems he took it personally.
I never took him for a triggerman.
He pays others for that.
I've lost three of my own chasing him.
Then you understand why I can't give him to you until we save my agent?
Because if she doesn't make it...
Agent Grant Ward.
Trip.
- Is Garrett upstairs?
- Yeah.
You know, he still talks about that 1,000-yard shot you took in Bandung.
It was 2,000.
So what are you doing here?
Man, this is like the Playboy jet.
Mmm-hmm.
I mean, a guy could get soft bunking in a space like this.
How did Coulson swing such a sweet ride?
- He died.
- That's tight.
You want to point me to the box you're keeping Quinn?
H.Q. ordered Garrett to haul his ass to the Fridge for questioning.
Is that a full bar?
You're welcome to it.
But Quinn stays put till Coulson says otherwise.
Come on, man.
Garrett was your S.O., too, so you know how this works.
Why don't you remind me?
Garrett wants Quinn.
It's my job to make sure Garrett gets what he wants.
- Now where is he?
- Can't help you with that.
No worries.
I'll find Quinn myself.
I'm sure he's tucked between the Jacuzzi and the squash court.
Hey...
Agent Ward, stand down!
Agent Garrett and I have come to an agreement.
He convinced H.Q. he could interrogate Quinn here on our plane as we continue to Bethesda.
Well, I'm a bit of a sweet talker when I need to be.
You wouldn't believe what I could talk this son-of-a-gun into.
- Good seeing you, son.
- You, too, sir.
And thank you.
Saving the girl's top priority.
And she might know something.
I never heard of half the drugs they gave Coulson.
GH-325?
And what about this robotic-assisted neural microsurgery they used to implant the Tahiti memories?
It all sounds so diabolical.
I agree.
We can't argue with the results.
He's walking around.
Yeah.
But at what cost?
You read the transcripts.
He begged the doctors to let him die.
This is different.
Skye's still alive.
We have to keep her that way.
Oh.
I've asked Dr. Streiten to advise us.
Hello.
Yes.
Are you sure?
That can't be.
And here I thought I was gonna get to play bad cop.
Ian Quinn, this is Agent Garrett.
He's here to ask you some questions.
No thank you.
My head's still ringing from the last visitor.
At least the last visitor left you with a head.
I'm not always that considerate.
I'm interested in one of your newer projects.
Hmm?
Oh, but there's so many to choose from.
Let me be clear.
You have no rights.
You have no lawyer.
The only thing keeping Agent Coulson here from throwing you out of this plane is the very weak heartbeat of a young agent downstairs.
And the only incentive I have for not tearing your tongue out is that you use it to answer my questions.
- Is that clear?
- Mmm-hmm.
- You understand that?
- No.
Tell us about Cybertek and the Deathlok Program.
- Deathlok?
- Catchy, right?
Sounds like some wrestler from the '80s.
What is it really?
Those are dangerous waters.
And the last agent that waded into them wound up with two in the stomach.
So, she's still alive?
Yeah.
And you better hope she stays that way.
Is that why you shot Skye?
Because she saw what Cybertek delivered?
No.
I shot Skye because that's what The Clairvoyant told me to do.
You wanted to see me?
I just got off the phone with the trauma center in Bethesda.
Dr. Streiten's gone off the grid.
So we'll find a different doctor there who operated on Coulson.
- That's the thing, actually.
- Coulson was never treated there.
- You're not making sense.
- None of this makes sense.
The doctors listed, the operating room number, none of them exist.
None of them are part of S.H.I.E.L.D.
What I find surprising is how a big-shot billionaire could fall for this psychic mumbo jumbo.
Oh, I doubted it at the beginning.
But then I realized it would be mutually beneficial.
He must have something pretty terrible on you.
Shooting an unarmed girl?
Let's just say, I learned the hard way that obeying was in my best interest.
Yet here you are.
Let me assure you, it wasn't luck that led me to your partner's black sedan in Berlin.
Or that he'd open the door for a redhead.
Or those two agents in Morocco.
Did you think it was just a roll of the dice that my people found them in that riad?
No.
It was The Clairvoyant.
Your Clairvoyant say anything about me knocking your teeth in?
The Clairvoyant sees everything.
Except what happened to him.
This is still about me?
Wait.
You're gonna need to rewind the tape, Phil.
You heard about my near-death before the Battle of New York?
There's more to it than that.
I thought I was gone for seconds.
Turns out, it was days.
That's impossible.
Which is why The Clairvoyant will do anything to know how it happened.
Even order you to shoot Skye.
Wait.
You don't know what S.H.I.E.L.D. did to save you.
That's why we're flying to where I was treated.
So, shooting the girl forces you to either figure it all out...
So The Clairvoyant can finally see.
Or you let the girl die.
Quinn shot Skye for nothing.
The place where we're going, the doctors who treated you, they don't exist.
Or maybe they exist somewhere else.
This is S.H.I.E.L.D. There are always secrets.
That's my fear, sir.
Your file is filled with secrets.
Experimental drugs, unknown surgical procedures we've never even heard of.
Frankly, Fitz and I only understand about 70% of what's in here.
Even if we do find where they treated you, and we were able to replicate the procedure, there's the other obvious question.
- Which is?
- Whether we should.
What you experienced, sir, if this file is even partially accurate...
No one's suggesting that we submit Skye to everything that I went through.
But if there's something in here, a drug, a treatment that can save her, we need to find it.
- Figure it out.
- Yes, sir.
- You disagree?
- No.
I think we need to do everything humanly possible to save Skye.
But we need to acknowledge that doing so might give The Clairvoyant exactly what he wants.
It's a risk we have to take.
How is she?
Deteriorating.
And I don't know how to stop it.
The only thing I found remotely interesting is something called GH-325.
Some kind of drug?
Agent Coulson was injected with it and literally minutes later, his wounds showed signs of cellular regeneration.
Regeneration?
Is that even possible?
Even if this miracle drug does exist, we don't know where to find it.
We have no coordinates, no logs of anyone's departure or arrival...
I think maybe I can help with that.
You set up the echo chamber.
Yeah, I made a couple of calls.
A buddy of mine works in the archives at the Triskelion.
Agreed to let us access it from here.
Hard to believe but this cube contains all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s historical administrative data.
But if Agent Coulson's operation didn't take place at a S.H.I.E.L.D. medical facility...
We won't find any record of it in here, I know.
But this also contains all inter-office memos, travel arrangements, purchase orders.
Maybe we can track down the location through a virtual paper trail of some sort or another.
Yeah.
okay-
Well, let's start with the travel memoranda from the date Coulson got stabbed.
Okay.
Or, what about Dr. Streiten's departure from the Triskelion?
- Maybe they have that.
- Yeah.
Ready?
Here.
This is interesting.
A World War II bunker?
Collapsed bunker.
Definitely not a sanctioned S.H.I.E.L.D. facility.
"The Guest House?"
Exactly.
Guest House.
G-H.
GH-325.
Look at the file's access history.
The only record of it being opened...
Is by a Level 10 operative.
Director Fury.
So Fury's been to this place, and he's the person who sanctioned the operations on Agent Coulson, and why aren't you trying to find the file?
Damn.
Encrypted.
Skye could crack this.
What would she do?
It's not an encryption.
The Guest House is not a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility.
We don't know who or what's in there.
Be prepared for potential resistance.
No contact from inside?
I've tried every known channel.
No response.
- Place could be abandoned.
- Let's hope not.
We need the people inside to work on Skye.
Simmons is prepping Skye to move at a moment's notice, sir.
Trip can help.
He's had med-tech training.
Good.
We do our jobs right, this will all go peacefully.
What if they don't wanna help us?
I'll say, "Pretty please."
We need the doctors alive and the place intact.
If it does go sideways, Fitz, I need you down there to determine what Simmons can use to help Skye.
And then we take it.
Let's move.
Company.
Nothing's scheduled for a couple weeks.
Try the protocol.
How was the drive from Istanbul?
Countersign?
- No clue.
- Never heard it.
I can't find it in any of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s protocol directives.
This is Agent Coulson with S.H.I.E.L.D.
We don't know the counter but we have a team member in dire need of medical assistance.
We know she can be treated here.
Open the doors, maybe we can work something out.
Do you copy?
How was the drive from Istanbul?
We're looking for medical assistance.
A person's life is at stake.
Will you help us?
How was the drive from Istanbul?
"Pretty please," it is.
These guys are good.
Hacked their way in.
- How the hell did they find this place?
- Doesn't matter.
Didn't know the countersign.
- You want left or right?
- Left's good.
There's an antechamber and a set of glass doors.
Can't see much beyond that.
Lights are all out.
Well, they know we're coming.
Let's go say hello.
Clear!
Okay, Simmons, we're going in now.
Simmons.
Damn it.
Comms are down.
There's too much mountain on top of us.
Trust me, it's better.
You don't want them hearing the horrible death we're walking into.
Humor, son.
You Brits are too serious.
Besides, if the job was easy...
It wouldn't be any fun.
I'm not afraid.
Not yet.
I suspect the real danger won't happen until we breach that bulletproof glass.
Probably a stairwell back to the surface.
What do you think, Fitz?
Can you get us inside?
To certain, horrible death?
Absolutely.
Okay, sir, just say the word.
Once we get inside, everybody find cover.
All right, gentlemen, here we go.
We've come for medical assistance, but if you continue firing on us, we will defend...
I count two hostiles.
Copy that.
Ready?
- You got one of those little flash things?
- Yeah.
Ward.
Clear!
- See if you can get some lights on.
- Yeah.
No hard feelings, Bob.
Clear.
We're not done.
This one's hit.
Shouldn't be too hard to find.
Go.
We're gonna get you medical help.
Is anyone else down here?
Where are the doctors?
Med staff doesn't stay here.
We're looking for a drug.
GH-325.
It might help you, too.
Do I know you?
I don't know.
I might've spent some time here a while back.
Then you know about the timer.
We got a problem!
Semtex.
The whole place is rigged to blow.
There's enough explosive to bring down the whole mountain on top of us.
Sir, less than 10 minutes.
It's probably a fail-safe.
If the guards had eliminated us, they'd stop the timer.
Since they didn't...
There's some kind of emergency override.
Skye could probably get past it, but I can't hack the panel, which means we're trapped in here.
You're the guy who taught Ward how to disarm nuclear bombs.
Figure out a way to get us out of here.
Let's go find the drug.
So, this is some sort of medical facility?
Yeah, but if nobody's here, I'm not sure it'll do us any good.
Tough when it's your team.
You guys go back a ways?
Not really.
A few months.
We have nothing in common.
Couldn't be more different.
But you can't imagine your life without her?
Yes.
You've experienced that, Agent Triplett?
I have.
Sometimes a person takes you by surprise.
Yeah.
She's very lucky to have you.
I know if anything bad ever happens to me,
I hope you're in my corner, too.
Comms are down.
If I don't hear anything within the hour, I'm going after them.
Skye's coding.
Both of you, now.
How can we help?
- I need a unit of epi.
- Got it.
Let me die!
Don't.
Let me die, please.
Let me die!
- Is that where...
- Yeah.
Timer doesn't control the explosion.
It's just a clock.
Detonator must be somewhere else.
It's not in here, I'd have found it.
There's no time to search the whole compound.
Maybe we can take some Semtex, use it on the doors.
Sir, are you sure you wanna...
We should put suits on before we go in there.
You're right.
But there's no time.
Wish I could speak to Simmons.
She'd know what most of this stuff is.
Or at least which stuff not to touch.
Fitz.
Oh.
I don't see any GH.
Agent Coulson.
It's locked.
Here.
Put these on.
Got it.
Time to go.
We couldn't stop it.
Four minutes and counting.
Almost there.
Semtex throughout here as well.
This is it. 325.
This is the one we want.
We gotta go.
Get it up to Simmons.
Yeah.
Sir.
I'll be right behind you.
Go.
Three minutes.
Have you worked much with munitions, Agent Fitz?
Explosives are a fascinating specialty.
Very exacting.
Too big a concussion can trigger a chain reaction, bury us like fossils for 1,000 years.
Guess we don't have to worry about The Clairvoyant finding this place.
Agent Ward, you do the honors.
Thought you'd never ask.
- Can you slip through?
- Yeah.
Go.
Get that drug up there.
- Coulson.
- Where the hell is he?
Phil!
Go with Fitz.
Make sure that drug gets to the girl.
Agent Garrett...
Go!
Save the girl.
Weak, erratic heart rate.
Each time we save her, I ask myself,
"Is this what Skye would want?"
We didn't come this far to quit.
Get off the ground immediately.
They're alive.
Maybe we can...
Fitz, come in.
What's your status?
GARRETT;
Phil.
Phil, What the hell?
Clock's not slowing down.
It's about to get really warm in here.
Hey.
You with me?
The guys are out already.
They took the drug up to Skye.
No.
Don't give it to her.
The drug!
They can't give it to her!
All right.
You tell her yourself.
Right now we just need to get out of this mountain and off the ground.
Now, let's go!
We found it.
What is it?
And how much?
Injected where?
May, get us off the ground or it'll fall out from under us.
No!
Don't give it to her!
I was losing her anyway.
What harm can it do?
Come on, girl.
It's working.
She's spiking!
Stop it!
How can we stop it?
Skye!
- What's happening?
- I don't know.
Skye!
Do something!
We have to do something!
Her heartbeat.
She's stabilizing.
Simmons?
Can someone tell me what we just saw?
Girl's a fighter.
What was that stuff you just gave her?
I don't know.
All I know is that it worked.
You're a real miracle worker.
You did it.
Something happen down there?
I'm not sure.
One minute he was fine, the next it was like he'd seen a ghost.
I have good news and bad news.
Which would you like to hear first?
Bad news then.
There's a fair amount.
Your Clairvoyant, the one who said he'd have your back?
He's a no-show.
The site we were supposed to lead him to with our minds?
Blown to pieces, buried under 100 feet of rock.
Seems the only psychic power your buddy has shown is the ability to predict if you tell a rich, entitled dirtbag he's gonna get away with murder, he'll believe it.
Trip.
Girl's gonna live.
Live to testify how a billionaire shot her point blank in the stomach.
Oh, we got a great little home movie of you admitting that, genius.
This Clairvoyant played you and left you to rot.
You said there was good news.
I did?
Oh, yeah.
You still have your tongue.
Let's go.
I wanna thank you, Garrett, for letting us keep Quinn on the plane.
Don't mention it.
There's still time for me to make the rest of his life a long living hell.
I'm counting on it.
- Something I need to ask you, Phil.
- Of course.
We've known each other a long time.
Yes, we have.
Been in our share of tight spots together.
If it had gone the other way.
If Skye hadn't survived, were you really prepared to throw Quinn off this plane?
You were the one who made that threat.
I just asked to keep him on the plane for a while.
You're right.
It was me.
My mistake.
Until next time.
Might be sooner than you think.
My man Trip's got eyes for that biotech gal of yours.
Do you mind?
You did the impossible today.
You saved Skye's life.
Why aren't you happy about it?
They told me you were yelling to not use the drug.
To not use it on Skye.
Why?
What made you change your mind?
Phil?
Phil, you all right?
Being down there, seeing where I came from,
I just got really scared that she would suffer the way that I did.
But she didn't.
For whatever reason, she didn't.
I'm gonna go see if they have a map.
I'll be waiting in the car, Mrs. MacKenzie.
- Are you okay?
- No.
No, I'm parched and weary.
Is all of Midgard so desolate?
Midgard?
I don't know where that is.
This is Death Valley.
Oh.
I seek passage from this valley of death to a more bountiful land.
I wish I could help, but...
It's built for two.
You should ask the manager inside.
Maybe there's a bus later today.
She's your bride?
Yep.
Since yesterday morning.
And you prefer her to me?
Well, yeah.
I prefer Nicole to pretty much everyone.
That's why I married her.
Together forever.
Loyalty.
I admire that in a man.
I am going to need your help if I am to remain free.
Jimmy!
I swear to protect you and keep you safe.
But I don't even know your name.
It's Lorelei.
My name is Lorelei.
Previously on "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...
WhywouldS.H.I.E.L.D. keep details of your death from you?
What happened in Tahiti?
Director Fury ...
He had a team of scientists working around the clock
- I wanted to die.
- And we should have let you.
Once we capture Quinn, we'll be one step closer to the Clairvoyant.
- Where's Skye?
- Agent Coulson, it's dangerous... sending her in like that, all alone.
Oh.
Oh, god.
Hang on.
- Put her in there!
- Is it working?
!
We need to get her to a medical facility and fast.
1x14
- T.A.H.I.T.I.
She was shot twice in the abdomen at close range almost two hours ago.
She's tachycardic, hypotensive, and lost a significant amount of blood.
We had to lower her core body temp in order to transport her here.
It's probably what kept her alive this long.
We'll do everything we can.
- Oh, dear.
I'm a mess.
- No.
You were great.
Intubate, and let's start getting that shirt off.
Okay, let's prep her for ex-lap.
I'm here.
That's unacceptable.
I need to speak to Director Fury immediately, please.
Why didn't I stop her?
- I could have.
- As if you could stop Skye doing anything she's set her mind to.
I shouldn't have let her go after Quinn by herself.
What was I thinking?
It's not your fault.
She shouldn't have been there.
I'm her S.O. It's on me.
The one to blame is the man who shot her, Ian Quinn.
He's responsible.
Yes, the message is, I have an agent dying, and there are questions only he can answer.
- How is she?
- Not good.
The shots perforated her stomach and penetrated the large and small intestines.
We resected what we could, but...
- there's been too much damage.
- So what's next?
We can keep her comfortable, but you'll need to make a decision on whether or not you want to keep her on life support.
You're saying there's nothing to be done?
I'm saying you need to call her family and get them here as soon as possible.
We're her family.
In that case, I'm very sorry.
Finally.
I was beginning to think you'd forgotten ...
Ohh.
Wait!
You can't!
Why?
'Cause you're defenseless, like she was?
May!
May!
Outside, now.
He deserves to die, not her!
Agreed.
But right now, Quinn doesn't matter ... only Skye does, and I need you to pilot the plane.
You heard what the doctor said.
She said there was nothing more they could do for her, but there are doctors who brought me back from the dead.
If they can do that, I'm betting they can save Skye.
H.Q. radioed in.
They've ordered us to hand over Quinn for interrogation and transport to the fridge.
Do you want me to arrange the transfer?
No.
Quinn stays in our custody until I say otherwise.
Yes, sir.
Are you sure about this, taking her all the way to Bethesda?
It's where my file says I was treated after New York.
I understand, but what makes you think the doctors there will be able to do anything different?
- I know they saved you, but ...
- They did a lot more than save me.
It's time you know the truth.
That can't be.
What you're describing ...
it's medically impossible.
Except for the fact that I'm standing here ... proof that it's not impossible.
And here's more proof ... my file, describing how they brought me back ... the doctors, the procedures, the drugs.
Sir... it's against the law for us to read this.
- Are you sure?
- I don't care about your clearance level.
I'm ordering you to read it.
"Death and recovery report."
It's only recently that director Fury gave me access to this.
I've gone over it dozens of times.
I need you to decipher the medical parts of it
I didn't understand.
Feel free to reach out to Dr. Streiten.
He should be eager to answer any questions you may have.
Yes, I'm sure I'll have quite a few.
- So, what about Tahiti?
- Turns out, not so magical, just false memories implanted to cover up what was done.
Sir... it says here your heart was perforated, torn in half.
That part of it I understood.
And yet, they managed to heal the damaged tissue completely.
We need to understand how.
- So we can do the same for Skye.
- That's what I'm counting on.
- We'll get right on it, sir.
- Thank you.
- Hurt much?
- I'm fine.
Coulson told me how long he was dead.
But you already knew that, didn't you?
I saw Skye... in the pod, machines filtering her blood, breathing for her.
I'm not sure I'd make this play ... fly halfway around the world hoping for a second miracle.
If Coulson thinks there's a chance in a million to save Skye, to save any of us, he'd take it.
People like us ...
we need people like him.
So, yeah, it makes sense ... a lot more sense than the alternative.
- You mean giving up?
- Or killing the man responsible.
I did like seeing you go after Quinn.
You don't open the blinds like that very often.
S.H.I.E.L.D. 616, this is tower Michael Tango.
You are in violation of S.H.I.E.L.D. directive 1297.
- Respond immediately.
- Disobeying a direct order.
We didn't hand Quinn over for interrogation.
Great.
This is S.H.I.E.L.D. 616.
How do we proceed?
Prepare to be boarded and relinquish command.
Really?
All the war and chaos in the world, and S.H.I.E.L.D. sends a plane after us?
Three planes ...
a small transport to dock and a pair of F-35s to make sure we hand over Quinn.
If they scratched my paint, I'm gonna be pissed.
I'll await your orders, sir.
Garrett?
What the hell are you doing here?
Well, as opposed to the level 8 jackass I'm staring at,
- I still follow orders.
- You're the worst at following orders.
Maybe... but I like this one.
You are to immediately turn Ian Quinn over for transport to the fridge.
Agent Antoine Triplett, Agent Phillip Coulson.
You wouldn't know it to look at him, but Phil's one of our finest.
An honor, sir.
Trip joined me as my specialist after Ward came to your circus.
- Go secure the prisoner.
- Yes, sir.
Phil, come on.
Just because Fury gave you this pretty plane doesn't mean they won't shoot it out of the sky.
Why are you really here, Garrett?
S.H.I.E.L.D. could have sent any security team to collect Quinn.
Why you?
- You've been chasing him, too!
- Since Malta.
Then yesterday, your little Italian job cost my team weeks of work.
- You can't have him, not yet.
- This isn't a request.
Quinn shot one of my agents.
She's on life support in a med pod downstairs.
We are taking her to the trauma center in Bethesda.
Quinn actually pulled the trigger?
Skye infiltrated his compound in Malta.
When he saw her yesterday, seems he took it personally.
I never took him for a triggerman.
He pays others for that.
I've lost three of my own chasing him.
Then you understand why I can't give him to you until we save my agent.
Because if she doesn't make it...
- Agent Grant Ward.
- Trip.
- Is Garrett upstairs?
- Yeah.
You know, he still talks about that thousand-yard shot you took in Bandung.
It was 2,000.
So, what are you doing here?
Man, this is like the Playboy jet.
I mean, a guy could get soft bunking in a space like this.
How did Coulson swing such a sweet ride?
- He died.
- That's tight.
You want to point me to the box you're keeping Quinn?
H.Q. ordered Garrett to haul his ass to the fridge for questioning.
- Is that a full bar?
- You're welcome to it.
But, uh, Quinn stays put till Coulson says otherwise.
Come on, man.
Garrett was your S.O., too, so you know how this works.
- Why don't you remind me?
- Garrett wants Quinn.
It's my job to make sure Garrett gets what he wants.
- Now where is he?
- Can't help you with that.
No worries.
I'll find Quinn myself.
I'm sure he's tucked between the jacuzzi and the squash court.
Hey.
Agent Ward, stand down.
Agent Garrett and I have come to an agreement.
He convinced H.Q. he could interrogate Quinn here on our plane as we continue to Bethesda.
Well, I'm a bit of a sweet talker when I need to be.
You wouldn't believe what I could talk this son of a gun into.
- Good seeing you, son.
- You, too, sir.
And thank you.
Saving the girl's top priority, and she might know something.
I've never heard of half the drugs they gave Coulson ...
GH-325?
And what about this robotic-assisted- neural-micro-surgery they used to implant the Tahiti memories?
- It all sounds so diabolical.
- I agree.
We can't argue with the results.
He's walking around.
Yeah but at what cost?
You read the transcripts.
He begged the doctors to let him die.
This is different.
Skye's still alive.
We have to keep her that way.
Oh.
I've asked Dr. Streiten to advise us.
Hello.
Yes.
Are you sure?
That can't be.
And here I thought I was gonna get to play bad cop.
Ian Quinn, this is Agent Garrett.
- He's here to ask you some questions.
- Oh, no, thank you.
I ... my head's still ringing from the last visitor.
At least the last visitor left you with a head.
I'm not always that considerate.
I'm interested in one of your newer projects.
Hmm?
Oh, but there are so many to choose from.
Let me be clear ... you have no rights.
You have no lawyer.
The only thing keeping Agent Coulson here from throwing you out of this plane is the very weak heartbeat of a young agent downstairs, and the only incentive I have for not tearing your tongue out is that you use it to answer my questions.
Is that clear?
Mm-hmm.
- You understand that?
- No.
Tell us about Cybertek and the Deathlok program.
- Deathlok?
- Catchy, right?
Sounds like some wrestler from the '80s.
What is it really?
Those are dangerous waters, and the last agent that waded into them wound up with two in the stomach.
So... she's still alive?
Yeah.
And you better hope she stays that way.
Is that why you shot Skye, because she saw what Cybertek delivered?
No.
I shot Skye because that's what the Clairvoyant told me to do.
You wanted to see me?
I just got off the phone with the trauma center in Bethesda.
Dr. Streiten's gone off the grid.
So we'll find a different doctor there who operated on Coulson.
- That's the thing.
Actually...
- Coulson was never treated there.
- You're not making sense.
- None of this makes sense.
The doctors listed, the operating-room number ... none of them exist.
None of them are part of S.H.I.E.L.D.
What I find surprising is how a big-shot billionaire could fall for this psychic mumbo jumbo.
Oh, I doubted it at the beginning, but then I realized it would be mutually beneficial.
He must have something pretty terrible on you.
Shooting an unarmed girl?
Let's just say I learned the hard way that obeying was in my best interest.
Yet... here you are.
Let me assure you it wasn't luck that led me to your partner's black sedan in Berlin or that he'd open the door for a redhead or those two agents in Morocco.
Do you think it was just a roll of the dice that my people found them in that Riad?
No, it was the Clairvoyant.
Your Clairvoyant say anything about me knocking your teeth in?
The Clairvoyant sees everything except what happened to him.
This is still about me.
Wait.
You're gonna need to rewind the tape, Phil.
You heard about my near-death before the battle of New York?
There's more to it than that.
I thought I was gone for seconds ...
- turns out it was days.
- That's impossible.
Which is why the Clairvoyant will do anything to know how it happened.
- Even order you to shoot Skye.
- Wait.
You don't know what S.H.I.E.L.D. did to save you.
That's why we're flying to where I was treated.
So shooting the girl forces you to figure it all out.
- So the Clairvoyant can finally see.
- Or you let the girl die.
Quinn shot Skye for nothing.
The place we were going, the doctors who treated you ...
- they don't exist.
- Or maybe they exist somewhere else.
This is S.H.I.E.L.D. There are always secrets.
That's my fear, sir.
Your file is filled with secrets ... experimental drugs, unknown surgical procedures we've never even heard of.
Frankly, Fitz and I only understand about 70% of what's in here.
Even if we do find where they treated you and we were able to replicate the procedure, there's the other obvious question.
- Which is?
- Whether we should.
What you experienced, sir, if this file is even partially accurate ...
No one's suggesting that we submit Skye to everything that I went through, but if there's something in here ... a drug, a treatment that can save her, we need to find it.
- Figure it out.
- Yes, sir.
- You disagree.
- No.
I think we need to do everything humanly possible to save Skye.
But we need to acknowledge that doing so might give the Clairvoyant exactly what he wants.
It's a risk we have to take.
How is she?
Deteriorating, and I don't know how to stop it.
The only thing I've found remotely interesting
- is something called "GH-325."
- Some kind of drug?
Agent Coulson was injected with that, and literally minutes later, his wounds showed signs of cellular regeneration.
Regeneration?
Is that even possible?
Even if this miracle drug does exist, we don't know where to find it.
We have no coordinates, no logs of anyone's departure or arrival.
I think maybe I can help with that.
- You've set up the echo-chamber.
- Yeah, I made a couple of calls.
A buddy of mine works in the archives at the Triskelion.
Agreed to let us access it from here.
Hard to believe, but this cube contains all of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s historical administrative data.
Yeah, but if Agent Coulson's operation didn't take place at a S.H.I.E.L.D. medical facility ...
We won't find any record of it here ...
I know.
But this also contains all interoffice memos, travel arrangements, purchase orders.
Maybe we can track down the location through a virtual paper trail of some sort or another.
Yeah.
Okay.
Well, let's start with the travel memoranda from the date Coulson got stabbed.
Here we go.
Or, um, what about Dr. Streiten's departure from the Triskelion?
- Maybe they have that.
- Yeah.
- Here.
This is interesting.
- A World War II bunker?
"Collapsed" bunker.
Definitely not a sanctioned S.H.I.E.L.D. facility.
- "The Guest House"?
- Exactly.
Guest House ...
G.H. GH-325.
Look at the file's access history.
- The only record of it being opened...
- Is by a level 10 operative.
Director Fury.
So, Fury's been to this place, and he's the person who sanctioned the operations on Agent Coulson.
And why aren't you trying to find the file?
Ah, damn.
Encrypted.
Skye could crack this.
What would she do?
It's not an encryption.
The Guest House is not a S.H.I.E.L.D. facility.
We don't know who or what's in there.
- Be prepared for potential resistance.
- No contact from inside?
I've tried every known channel ... no response.
- Place could be abandoned.
- Let's hope not.
We need the people inside to work on Skye.
Simmons is prepping Skye to move at a moment's notice, sir.
Trip can help.
He's had med-tech training.
Good.
We do our jobs right, this will all go peacefully.
- What if they don't want to help us?
- I'll say "pretty please."
We need the doctors alive and the place intact.
If it does go sideways, Fitz, I need you down there to determine what Simmons can use to help Skye.
And then we take it.
Let's move.
Company?
Nothing's scheduled for a couple weeks.
Try the protocol.
How was the drive from Istanbul?
- Countersign?
- No clue.
- Never heard it.
- I can't find it in any of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s protocol directives.
This is Agent Coulson with S.H.I.E.L.D.
We don't know the counter, but we have a team member in dire need of medical assistance.
We know she can be treated here.
Open the doors.
Maybe we can work something out.
Do you copy?
How was the drive from Istanbul?
We're looking for medical assistance.
A person's life is at stake.
Will you help us?
How was the drive from Istanbul?
"Pretty please" it is.
These guys are good...
hacked their way in.
How the hell did they find this place?
Doesn't matter.
Didn't know the countersign.
- You want left or right?
- Left's good.
There's an antechamber and a set of glass doors.
Can't see much beyond that.
Lights are all out.
Well, they know we're coming.
Let's go say "hello."
Clear.
Okay, Simmons, we're going in now.
Simmons?
Damn it.
Comms are down.
There's too much mountain on top of us.
Trust me ... it's better.
You don't want them hearing the horrible death we're walking into.
Humor, son.
You Brits are too serious.
- Besides, if the job was easy...
- It wouldn't be any fun.
I'm not afraid ... not yet.
I suspect the real danger won't happen until we breach that bulletproof glass.
Probably a stairwell back to the surface.
What do you think, Fitz?
Can you get us inside?
To certain, horrible death?
Absolutely.
Okay, sir, just say the word.
Once we get inside, everybody find cover.
All right, gentlemen, here we go.
We've come for medical assistance.
But you continue firing on us, we will defend oursel...
- I count two hostiles.
- Copy that.
Ready?
You got one of those little flash things?
Yeah.
Ward!
Clear!
- See if you can get some lights on.
- Yeah.
No hard feelings, Bob.
Clear.
We're not done.
This one's hit.
Shouldn't be too hard to find.
Go.
We're gonna get you medical help.
Is anyone else down here?
Where are the doctors?
Med staff doesn't stay here.
We're looking for a drug ...
GH-325.
It might help you, too.
- Do I... k-know you?
- I don't know.
I-I might have spent some time here awhile back.
Then you know about... the timer.
We got a problem!
Semtex.
The whole place is rigged to blow.
There's enough explosive to bring down the whole mountain on top of us.
Sir.
Less than 10 minutes.
It's probably a failsafe.
If the guards had eliminated us, they'd stop the timer.
Since they didn't...
It's some kind of emergency override.
Skye could probably get past it, but I can't hack the panel, which means we're trapped in here.
You're the guy who taught Ward how to disarm nuclear bombs.
Figure out a way to get us out of here.
Let's go find the drug.
So this is some sort of medical facility.
Yeah, but if nobody's here, I'm not sure it's gonna do us any good.
Tough when it's your team.
You guys go back a ways?
Not really.
A few months.
We have nothing in common ...
couldn't be more different.
But you can't imagine your life without her.
Yes.
You've experienced that, Agent Triplett?
I have.
Sometimes, a person takes you by surprise.
Yeah.
She's very lucky to have you.
I know anything bad ever happens to me, hope you're in my corner, too.
Comms are down.
If I don't hear anything within the hour, I'm going after them.
Skye's coding.
Both of you, now.
How can we help?
I need a unit of Epi.
Got it.
Don't.
Let me die.
Please.
Let me die!
- Is that where...
- Yeah.
The timer doesn't control the explosion.
It's just a clock.
Detonator must be somewhere else.
It's not in here, or I'd have found it.
There's no time to search the whole compound.
Maybe we can take some semtex, use it on the doors.
Sir, are you sure you want to?
We should put suits on before we go in there.
You're right, but there's no time.
I wish I could speak to Simmons.
She'd know what most of this stuff is ... or, at least, what stuff not to touch.
Uh...
Fitz.
Oh.
I don't see any G.H...
Agent Coulson.
It's locked.
Here.
Put these on.
Got it.
Time to go.
We couldn't stop it.
Four minutes and counting.
Almost there.
There's semtex throughout here, as well.
This is it ... 325.
- This is the one we want.
- We gotta go.
- Get it up to Simmons.
- Yeah.
Sir.
I'll be right behind you.
Go.
Three minutes.
Have you worked much with munitions, Agent Fitz?
Explosives are a fascinating specialty ... very exacting.
Too big a concussion could trigger a chain reaction ... bury us like fossils for a thousand years.
Guess we don't have to worry about the Clairvoyant finding this place.
Agent Ward...
would you do the honors?
Thought you'd never ask.
Can you slip through?
- Yeah.
- Go.
All right.
Get that drug up there.
- Coulson.
- Where the hell is he?
Phil!
Go with Fitz.
Make sure that drug gets to the girl.
- Agent Garrett.
- Go!
Save the girl.
Weak, erratic heart rate.
Each time we save her, I ask myself, "is this what Skye would want?"
We didn't come this far to quit.
Getoff...
the ground immediately.
They're alive.
Maybe we can ...
Fitz, come in.
What's your status?
Phil!
Phil, what the hell?
Clock's not slowing down.
- It's about to get really warm in here.
- Hey, you with me?
The guys are out already.
They took the drug up to Skye.
No, don't give it to her.
The drug ... they can't give it to her!
All right.
You can tell them yourself.
Right now, we just need to get out of this mountain and off the ground.
Now let's go.
You want more epinephrine?
- We found it.
- What is it?
And how much, injected where?
May, get us off the ground, or it'll fall out from under us.
No!
Don't give it to her!
I was losing her, anyway.
What harm can it do?
Come on, girl.
It's working.
She'sspiking.
Stop it.
How can we stop it?
Skye!
- What's happening?
- I don't know...
Skye!
Do something ...
we have to do something!
Her heartbeat ... she's stabilizing.
Simmons?
Could someone tell me what we just saw?
The girl's a fighter.
What was that stuff you just gave her?
I don't know.
All I know is that it worked.
You're a real miracle worker.
You did it.
Something happen down there?
I'm not sure.
One minute, he was fine.
The next, it was like he had seen a ghost.
I have good news and bad news.
Which would you like to hear first?
Bad news, then ...
there's a fair amount.
Your Clairvoyant, the one who said he'd have your back ... he's a no-show.
The site we were supposed to lead him to with our minds ... blown to pieces, buried under 100 feet of rock.
It seems the only psychic power your buddy has shown is the ability to predict if you tell tell a rich, entitled dirtbag he's gonna get away with murder, he'll believe it.
Trip.
Girl's gonna live ... live to testify how a billionaire shot her point-blank in the stomach.
Oh, we got a great little home movie of you admitting that, genius.
This Clairvoyant played you and left you to rot.
- You said there was good news.
- I did?
Oh, yeah.
You still have your tongue.
Let's go.
I want to thank you, Garrett, for letting us keep Quinn on the plane.
Don't mention it.
There's still time for me to make the rest of his life a long, living hell.
I'm counting on it.
- Something I need to ask you, Phil.
- Of course.
- We've known each other a long time.
- Yes, we have.
Been in our share of tight spots together.
If it had gone the other way...
if Skye hadn't survived, were you really prepared to throw Quinn off this plane?
You were the one who made that threat.
I just asked to keep him on the plane for awhile.
You're right.
It was me.
- My mistake.
- Till next time.
Might be sooner than you think.
My man Trip's got eyes for that biotech gal of yours.
Do you mind?
You did the impossible today.
You saved Skye's life.
Why aren't you happy about it?
They told me you were yelling...
to not use the drug, to not use it on Skye.
Why?
What made you change your mind?
Phil?
Phil!
You all right?
Being down there... seeing where I came from...
I just got really scared that she would suffer the way that I did.
But she didn't.
For whatever reason...
she didn't.
"Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D." will return in a moment.
I'm gonna go see if they have a map.
I'll be waiting in the car, Mrs. Mackenzie.
- Are you okay?
- No.
No, I'm parched and weary.
Is all of Midgard so desolate?
Midgard?
I don't know where that is.
- This is Death Valley.
- Oh.
I seek passage from this...
valley of death to a more bountiful land.
I wish I could help,but...
it's built for two.
Y-you should ask the manager inside.
Uh, maybe there's a bus later today.
- She's your bride?
- Yep, since yesterday morning.
And you prefer her to me?
Well... yeah.
I prefer Nicole to pretty much everyone.
That's why I married her ...
together forever.
Loyalty ...
I admire that in a man.
I am going to need your help...
if I am to remain free.
Jimmy!
I swear to protect you and keep you safe, but I don't even know your name.
It's Lorelei.
My name is Lorelei.
Previously on "marvel's agents of s.H.I.E.L.D."...
Raina:
Why would s.H.I.E.L.D. Keep details
Of your death from you?
What happened in tahiti?
Dr. Streiten:
Director fury --
He had a team of scientists working around the clock
I wanted to die.
And we should have let you.
Coulson:
Once we capture quinn,
We'll be one step closer to the clairvoyant.
Where's skye?
Agent coulson, it's dangerous...
Sending her in like that, all alone.
[ gunshot ]
Oh.
Oh, god.
Hang on.
Put her in there!
Is it working?
!
We need to get her to a medical facility and fast.
She was shot twice in the abdomen
At close range almost two hours ago.
She's tachycardic, hypotensive,
And lost a significant amount of blood.
We had to lower her core body temp
In order to transport her here.
It's probably what kept her alive this long.
We'll do everything we can.
Dear.
I'm a mess.
No.
You were great.
Intubate, and let's start getting that shirt off.
[ monitor beeping ]
Okay, let's prep her for ex-lap.
I'm here.
That's unacceptable.
I need to speak to director fury immediately, please.
Why didn't I stop her?
I could have.
As if you could stop skye
Doing anything she's set her mind to.
I shouldn't have let her go after quinn by herself.
What was I thinking?
It's not your fault.
She shouldn't have been there.
I'm her s.O. It's on me.
The one to blame is the man who shot her, ian quinn.
He's responsible.
Coulson:
Yes, the message is, I have an agent dying,
And there are questions only he can answer.
[ beep ] [ sighs ]
[ birds chirping ]
[ woman talking over p.A. ]
How is she?
Not good.
The shots perforated her stomach
And penetrated the large and small intestines.
We resected what we could, but...
There's been too much damage.
So what's next?
We can keep her comfortable,
But you'll need to make a decision
On whether or not you want to keep her on life support.
You're saying there's nothing to be done?
I'm saying you need to call her family
And get them here as soon as possible.
We're her family.
In that case, I'm very sorry.
Finally.
I was beginning to think you'd forgotten --
Ohh.
[ grunting ]
Wait!
You can't!
[ grunts ] why?
'cause you're defenseless, like she was?
[ grunting ]
May!
May!
[ breathing heavily ]
Outside, now.
Aah.
He deserves to die, not her.
Agreed.
But right now, quinn doesn't matter --
Only skye does, and I need you to pilot the plane.
You heard what the doctor said.
She said there was nothing more they could do for her,
But there are doctors who brought me back from the dead.
If they can do that, I'm betting they can save skye.
[ metal clangs ] [ monitor beeping ]
H.Q. Radioed in.
They've ordered us to hand over quinn for interrogation
And transport to the fridge.
Do you want me to arrange the transfer?
No.
Quinn stays in our custody until I say otherwise.
Yes, sir.
Are you sure about this, taking her all the way to bethesda?
It's where my file says I was treated after new york.
I understand, but what makes you think
The doctors there will be able to do anything different?
I know they saved you, but --
They did a lot more than save me.
They kept me alive for days.
Simmons:
That can't be.
What you're describing -- it's medically impossible.
Except for the fact that I'm standing here --
Proof that it's not impossible.
And here's more proof --
My file, describing how they brought me back --
The doctors, the procedures, the drugs.
Sir...
It's against the law for us to read this.
Are you sure?
I don't care about your clearance level.
I'm ordering you to read it.
"death and recovery report."
It's only recently
That director fury gave me access to this.
I've gone over it dozens of times.
I need you to decipher the medical parts of it
I didn't understand.
Feel free to reach out to dr.
Streiten.
He should be eager to answer any questions you may have.
Yes, I'm sure I'll have quite a few.
So, what about tahiti?
Turns out, not so magical,
Just false memories implanted to cover up what was done.
Sir...
It says here
Your heart was perforated, torn in half.
That part of it I understood.
And yet, they managed to heal the damaged tissue completely.
We need to understand how.
So we can do the same for skye.
That's what I'm counting on.
We'll get right on it, sir.
Thank you.
[ sighs ]
Hurt much?
I'm fine.
Coulson told me how long he was dead.
But you already knew that, didn't you?
I saw skye...
In the pod,
Machines filtering her blood, breathing for her.
I'm not sure I'd make this play --
Fly halfway around the world hoping for a second miracle.
If coulson thinks there's a chance in a million
To save skye, to save any of us, he'd take it.
People like us -- we need people like him.
So, yeah, it makes sense --
A lot more sense than the alternative.
You mean giving up?
Or killing the man responsible.
I did like seeing you go after quinn.
You don't open the blinds like that very often.
Woman:
S.H.I.E.L.D. 616, this is tower michael tango.
You are in violation of s.H.I.E.L.D. Directive 1297.
Disobeying a direct order.
We didn't hand quinn over for interrogation.
Great.
[ engines roar ]
This is s.H.I.E.L.D. 616.
How do we proceed?
Prepare to be boarded and relinquish command.
Really?
All the war and chaos in the world,
And s.H.I.E.L.D. Sends a plane after us?
Three planes -- a small transport to dock
And a pair of f-35s to make sure we hand over quinn.
[ thud ] [ whirring ]
If they scratched my paint, I'm gonna be pissed.
I'll await your orders, sir.
Garrett?
What the hell are you doing here?
Well, as opposed to the level 8 jackass I'm staring at,
I still follow orders.
You're the worst at following orders.
Maybe...
But I like this one.
You are to immediately turn ian quinn over
For transport to the fridge.
Agent antoine triplett, agent phillip coulson.
You wouldn't know it to look at him,
But phil's one of our finest.
An honor, sir.
Trip joined me as my specialist after ward came to your circus.
Go secure the prisoner.
Yes, sir.
Phil, come on.
Just because fury gave you this pretty plane
Doesn't mean they won't shoot it out of the sky.
Why are you really here, garrett?
S.H.I.E.L.D. Could have sent any security team to collect quinn.
Why you?
You've been chasing him, too.
Since malta.
Then yesterday, your little italian job
Cost my team weeks of work.
You can't have him, not yet.
This isn't a request.
Quinn shot one of my agents.
She's on life support in a med pod downstairs.
We are taking her to the trauma center in bethesda.
Quinn actually pulled the trigger?
Skye infiltrated his compound in malta.
When he saw her yesterday, seems he took it personally.
I never took him for a triggerman.
He pays others for that.
I've lost three of my own chasing him.
Then you understand why I can't give him to you
Until we save my agent.
Because if she doesn't make it...
Agent grant ward.
Trip.
[ chuckles ]
Is garrett upstairs?
Yeah.
You know, he still talks about
That thousand-yard shot you took in bandung.
It was 2,000.
So, what are you doing here?
Man, this is like the playboy jet.
Mm.
[ chuckles ]
I mean, a guy could get soft bunking in a space like this.
How did coulson swing such a sweet ride?
He died.
That's tight.
You want to point me to the box you're keeping quinn?
H.Q. Ordered garrett to haul his ass
To the fridge for questioning.
[ breathes sharply ]
Is that a full bar?
You're welcome to it.
But, uh, quinn stays put till coulson says otherwise.
Come on, man.
Garrett was your s.O., too, so you know how this works.
Why don't you remind me?
Garrett wants quinn.
It's my job to make sure garrett gets what he wants.
Now where is he?
Can't help you with that.
No worries.
I'll find quinn myself.
I'm sure he's tucked between the jacuzzi and the squash court.
Hey.
[ both grunting ]
Agent ward, stand down.
[ coughs ]
Agent garrett and I have come to an agreement.
He convinced h.Q. He could interrogate quinn here
On our plane as we continue to bethesda.
Well, I'm a bit of a sweet talker when I need to be.
You wouldn't believe
What I could talk this son of a gun into.
Good seeing you, son.
You, too, sir.
And thank you.
Saving the girl's top priority, and she might know something.
I've never heard of half the drugs they gave coulson --
Gh-325?
And what about
This robotic-assisted- neural-micro-surgery
They used to implant the tahiti memories?
It all sounds so diabolical.
I agree.
We can't argue with the results.
He's walking around.
Yeah, but at what cost?
You read the transcripts.
He begged the doctors to let him die.
This is different.
Skye's still alive.
We have to keep her that way.
[ cellphone vibrates ]
Oh.
I've asked dr.
Streiten to advise us.
[ beep ] hello.
Yes.
Are you sure?
That can't be.
[ door opens ]
And here I thought I was gonna get to play bad cop.
Ian quinn, this is agent garrett.
He's here to ask you some questions.
Oh, no, thank you.
I -- my head's still ringing from the last visitor.
At least the last visitor left you with a head.
I'm not always that considerate.
I'm interested in one of your newer projects.
Hmm?
Oh, but there are so many to choose from.
[ grunts ]
Let me be clear -- you have no rights.
You have no lawyer.
The only thing keeping agent coulson here
From throwing you out of this plane
Is the very weak heartbeat of a young agent downstairs,
And the only incentive I have for not tearing your tongue out
Is that you use it to answer my questions.
Is that clear?
[ mumbling ] mm-hmm.
You understand that?
No.
[ groans ]
Aah.
Ohh.
Tell us about cybertek and the deathlok program.
Deathlok?
Catchy, right?
Sounds like some wrestler from the '80s.
What is it really?
Those are dangerous waters,
And the last agent that waded into them
Wound up with two in the stomach.
[ grunting ]
So...
She's still alive?
Yeah.
And you better hope she stays that way.
Is that why you shot skye,
Because she saw what cybertek delivered?
No.
I shot skye because that's what the clairvoyant told me to do.
May:
You wanted to see me?
I just got off the phone with the trauma center in bethesda.
Dr. Streiten's gone off the grid.
So we'll find a different doctor there who operated on coulson.
That's the thing.
Actually...
Coulson was never treated there.
You're not making sense.
None of this makes sense.
The doctors listed, the operating-room number --
None of them exist.
None of them are part of s.H.I.E.L.D.
What I find surprising is how a big-shot billionaire
Could fall for this psychic mumbo jumbo.
Oh, I doubted it at the beginning,
But then I realized it would be mutually beneficial.
He must have something pretty terrible on you.
Shooting an unarmed girl?
Let's just say I learned the hard way
That obeying was in my best interest.
Yet...
Here you are.
Let me assure you it wasn't luck
That led me to your partner's black sedan in berlin
Or that he'd open the door for a redhead
Or those two agents in morocco.
Do you think it was just a roll of the dice
That my people found them in that riad?
No, it was the clairvoyant.
Your clairvoyant say anything about me knocking your teeth in?
The clairvoyant sees everything Except what happened to him.
This is still about me.
Wait.
You're gonna need to rewind the tape, phil.
You heard about my near-death before the battle of new york?
There's more to it than that.
I thought I was gone for seconds --
Turns out it was days.
That's impossible.
Which is why the clairvoyant will do anything
To know how it happened.
Even order you to shoot skye.
Garrett:
Wait.
You don't know what s.H.I.E.L.D. Did to save you.
That's why we're flying to where I was treated.
So shooting the girl forces you to figure it all out.
So the clairvoyant can finally see.
Or you let the girl die.
[ sighs ]
[ engine roars ]
Quinn shot skye for nothing.
The place we were going, the doctors who treated you --
They don't exist.
Or maybe they exist somewhere else.
This is s.H.I.E.L.D. There are always secrets.
That's my fear, sir.
Your file is filled with secrets --
Experimental drugs, unknown surgical procedures
We've never even heard of.
Frankly, fitz and I only understand
About 70% of what's in here.
Even if we do find where they treated you
And we were able to replicate the procedure,
There's the other obvious question.
Which is?
Whether we should.
What you experienced, sir,
If this file is even partially accurate --
No one's suggesting that we submit skye
To everything that I went through,
But if there's something in here -- a drug,
A treatment that can save her, we need to find it.
Figure it out.
Yes, sir.
You disagree.
No.
I think we need to do everything humanly possible to save skye.
But we need to acknowledge that doing so
Might give the clairvoyant exactly what he wants.
It's a risk we have to take.
[ sighs ] [ monitor beeping ]
How is she?
Deteriorating, and I don't know how to stop it.
The only thing I've found remotely interesting
Is something called "gh-325."
Some kind of drug?
Agent coulson was injected with that,
And literally minutes later,
His wounds showed signs of cellular regeneration.
Regeneration?
Is that even possible?
Even if this miracle drug does exist,
We don't know where to find it.
We have no coordinates,
No logs of anyone's departure or arrival.
I think maybe I can help with that.
You've set up the echo-chamber.
Yeah, I made a couple of calls.
A buddy of mine works in the archives at the triskelion.
Agreed to let us access it from here.
Hard to believe, but this cube contains
All of s.H.I.E.L.D.'s historical administrative data.
Yeah, but if agent coulson's operation didn't take place
At a s.H.I.E.L.D. Medical facility --
We won't find any record of it here -
- I know.
But this also contains all interoffice memos,
Travel arrangements, purchase orders.
Maybe we can track down the location
Through a virtual paper trail of some sort or another.
Yeah.
[ beeping ] [ gasps ] [ sighs ] okay.
Well, let's start with the travel memoranda
From the date coulson got stabbed.
[ beeping ]
Here we go.
Or, um, what about
Dr. Streiten's departure from the triskelion?
Maybe they have that.
Yeah.
Here.
This is interesting.
A world war ii bunker?
"collapsed" bunker.
Definitely not a sanctioned s.H.I.E.L.D. Facility.
"the guest house"?
Exactly.
Guest house -- g.H. Gh-325.
Look at the file's access history.
The only record of it being opened...
Is by a level 10 operative.
Director fury.
Director fury.
So, fury's been to this place, and he's the person
Who sanctioned the operations on agent coulson.
And why aren't you trying to find the file?
[ beeping ]
Ah, damn.
Encrypted.
Skye could crack this.
What would she do?
It's not an encryption.
[ engine roars ]
The guest house is not a s.H.I.E.L.D. Facility.
We don't know who or what's in there.
Be prepared for potential resistance.
No contact from inside?
May:
I've tried every known channel -- no response.
Place could be abandoned.
Let's hope not.
We need the people inside to work on skye.
Simmons is prepping skye to move at a moment's notice, sir.
Trip can help.
He's had med-tech training.
Good.
We do our jobs right, this will all go peacefully.
What if they don't want to help us?
I'll say "pretty please."
We need the doctors alive and the place intact.
If it does go sideways, fitz, I need you down there
To determine what simmons can use to help skye.
And then we take it.
Let's move.
[ tone plays ]
Alpha:
Company?
Nothing's scheduled for a couple weeks.
Try the protocol.
Alpha:
How was the drive from istanbul?
Countersign?
No clue.
Never heard it.
Fitz:
I can't find it
In any of s.H.I.E.L.D.'s protocol directives.
This is agent coulson with s.H.I.E.L.D.
We don't know the counter, but we have a team member
In dire need of medical assistance.
We know she can be treated here.
Open the doors.
Maybe we can work something out.
Do you copy?
How was the drive from istanbul?
We're looking for medical assistance.
A person's life is at stake.
Will you help us?
How was the drive from istanbul?
"pretty please" it is.
These guys are good -- hacked their way in.
How the hell did they find this place?
Doesn't matter.
Didn't know the countersign.
You want left or right?
Left's good.
[ elevator bell dings ]
There's an antechamber and a set of glass doors.
Can't see much beyond that.
Lights are all out.
Well, they know we're coming.
Let's go say "hello."
Clear.
Okay, simmons, we're going in now.
Simmons?
Damn it.
Comms are down.
There's too much mountain on top of us.
Trust me -- it's better.
You don't want them
Hearing the horrible death we're walking into.
Humor, son.
You brits are too serious.
Besides, if the job was easy...
It wouldn't be any fun.
I'm not afraid -- not yet.
I suspect the real danger won't happen
Until we breach that bulletproof glass.
Probably a stairwell back to the surface.
What do you think, fitz?
Can you get us inside?
To certain, horrible death?
Absolutely.
Okay, sir, just say the word.
Once we get inside, everybody find cover.
All right, gentlemen, here we go.
[ beep ]
We've come for medical assistance.
But you continue firing on us, we will defend oursel--
I count two hostiles.
Copy that.
Ready?
You got one of those little flash things?
Yeah.
Ward.
[ groans ]
Clear!
See if you can get some lights on.
Yeah.
[ sighs ]
No hard feelings, bob.
Clear.
We're not done.
This one's hit.
Shouldn't be too hard to find.
Coulson:
Go.
We're gonna get you medical help.
Is anyone else down here?
Where are the doctors?
Med staff doesn't stay here.
We're looking for a drug -- gh-325.
It might help you, too.
Do I...
K-know you?
I don't know.
I-I might have spent some time here awhile back.
Then you know about...
The timer.
Garrett:
We got a problem!
[ breathes sharply ]
Semtex.
The whole place is rigged to blow.
Fitz:
There's enough explosive
To bring down the whole mountain on top of us.
Sir.
Less than 10 minutes.
It's probably a failsafe.
If the guards had eliminated us, they'd stop the timer.
Since they didn't...
Fitz:
It's some kind of emergency override.
Skye could probably get past it, but I can't hack the panel,
Which means we're trapped in here.
You're the guy who taught ward how to disarm nuclear bombs.
Figure out a way to get us out of here.
Let's go find the drug.
So this is some sort of medical facility.
Yeah, but if nobody's here,
I'm not sure it's gonna do us any good.
[ monitor beeping ]
Tough when it's your team.
You guys go back a ways?
Not really.
A few months.
We have nothing in common -- couldn't be more different.
But you can't imagine your life without her.
Yes.
You've experienced that, agent triplett?
I have.
Sometimes, a person takes you by surprise.
Yeah.
She's very lucky to have you.
I know anything bad ever happens to me,
Hope you're in my corner, too.
[ footsteps approach ]
May:
Comms are down.
If I don't hear anything within the hour, I'm going after them.
[ rapid beeping ]
Skye's coding.
Both of you, now.
[ flatline ]
How can we help?
I need a unit of epi.
Got it.
Don't.
Let me die.
Let me die!
Is that where...
Yeah.
The timer doesn't control the explosion.
It's just a clock.
Detonator must be somewhere else.
It's not in here, or I'd have found it.
There's no time to search the whole compound.
Maybe we can take some semtex, use it on the doors.
Sir, are you sure you want to?
We should put suits on before we go in there.
You're right, but there's no time.
I wish I could speak to simmons.
She'd know what most of this stuff is --
Or, at least, what stuff not to touch.
Uh...
Fitz.
Oh.
I don't see any g.H...
Agent coulson.
It's locked.
Here.
Put these on.
Got it.
Time to go.
We couldn't stop it.
Four minutes and counting.
Almost there.
There's semtex throughout here, as well.
This is it -- 325.
This is the one we want.
We got to go.
Get it up to simmons.
Yeah.
Sir.
I'll be right behind you.
Go.
Three minutes.
Have you worked much with munitions, agent fitz?
Explosives are a fascinating specialty --
Very exacting.
Too big a concussion could trigger a chain reaction --
Bury us like fossils for a thousand years.
Guess we don't have to worry
About the clairvoyant finding this place.
Agent ward...
Would you do the honors?
Ward:
Thought you'd never ask.
[ gun cocks ]
Can you slip through?
[ grunts ] go.
All right.
Get that drug up there.
Coulson.
Where the hell is he?
Phil!
Go with fitz.
Make sure that drug gets to the girl.
Agent garrett.
Go!
Save the girl.
Simmons:
Weak, erratic heart rate.
Each time we save her, I ask myself,
"is this what skye would want?"
We didn't come this far to quit.
Fitz:
Get o-- the ground immediately.
They're alive.
Maybe we can -- [ flatline ] fitz, come in.
What's your status?
[ breathing sharply ]
Garrett:
Phil!
Phil, what the hell?
Clock's not slowing down.
It's about to get really warm in here.
Hey, you with me?
The guys are out already.
They took the drug up to skye.
No, don't give it to her.
The drug -- they can't give it to her!
All right.
You can tell them yourself.
Right now, we just need to get out of this mountain
And off the ground.
Now let's go.
[ flatline ]
You want more epinephrine?
We found it.
What is it?
And how much, injected where?
May, get us off the ground, or it'll fall out from under us.
[ whirring ]
[ engine roaring ]
No!
Don't give it to her!
[ flatline ]
I was losing her, anyway.
What harm can it do?
[ monitor beeping ]
Come on, girl.
Garrett:
It's working.
[ rapid beeping ] simmons:
She's spiking.
Stop it.
How can we stop it?
Skye!
What's happening?
[ crying ] [ grunting ]
Fitz:
Do something -- we have to do something.
[ gasping ]
[ beeping slows ]
Her heartbeat -- she's stabilizing.
[ sighs ]
Could someone tell me what we just saw?
The girl's a fighter.
What was that stuff you just gave her?
I don't know.
All I know is that it worked.
You're a real miracle worker.
You did it.
Something happen down there?
I'm not sure.
One minute, he was fine.
The next, it was like he had seen a ghost.
I have good news and bad news.
Which would you like to hear first?
[ door closes ]
Bad news, then -- there's a fair amount.
Your clairvoyant, the one who said he'd have your back --
He's a no-show.
The site we were supposed to lead him to with our minds --
Blown to pieces, buried under 100 feet of rock.
It seems the only psychic power your buddy has shown
Is the ability to predict
If you tell tell a rich, entitled dirtbag
He's gonna get away with murder, he'll believe it.
Trip.
Girl's gonna live --
Live to testify how a billionaire shot her
Point-blank in the stomach.
Oh, we got a great little home movie
Of you admitting that, genius.
This clairvoyant played you and left you to rot.
You said there was good news.
I did?
Oh, yeah.
You still have your tongue.
[ scoffs ]
Let's go.
I want to thank you, garrett,
For letting us keep quinn on the plane.
Don't mention it.
There's still time for me
To make the rest of his life a long, living hell.
I'm counting on it.
Something I need to ask you, phil.
Of course.
We've known each other a long time.
Yes, we have.
Been in our share of tight spots together.
If it had gone the other way -- if skye hadn't survived,
Were you really prepared to throw quinn off this plane?
You were the one who made that threat.
I just asked to keep him on the plane for awhile.
You're right.
It was me.
My mistake.
Till next time.
Might be sooner than you think.
My man trip's got eyes for that biotech gal of yours.
[ whirring ]
Do you mind?
You did the impossible today.
You saved skye's life.
Why aren't you happy about it?
[ sighs ]
They told me you were yelling to not use the drug,
To not use it on skye.
Why?
What made you change your mind?
[ whirring ]
[ gasps ]
Phil?
Phil?
You all right?
Being down there...
Seeing where I came from -- I just got really scared
That she would suffer the way that I did.
But she didn't.
For whatever reason...
She didn't.
"marvel's agents of s.H.I.E.L.D."
Will return in a moment.
Nicole:
I'm gonna go see if they have a map.
I'll be waiting in the car, mrs.
Mackenzie.
[ chuckles ]
[ panting ]
Are you okay?
[ sighs ] no.
No, I'm parched and weary.
Is all of midgard so desolate?
Midgard?
I don't know where that is.
This is death valley.
Oh.
I seek passage from this valley of death
To a more bountiful land.
I wish I could help, but...
It's built for two.
Y-you should ask the manager inside.
Uh, maybe there's a bus later today.
She's your bride?
Yep, since yesterday morning.
And you prefer her to me?
Well...
Yeah.
I prefer nicole to pretty much everyone.
That's why I married her -- together forever.
[ chuckles ]
Loyalty -- I admire that in a man.
I am going to need your help if I am to remain free.
[ engine revs ]
Jimmy!
I swear to protect you and keep you safe,
But I don't even know your name.
It's lorelei.
My name is lorelei.
Previously on Pretty Little Liars.
I'm cutting you off, you're over caffeinated.
Hey, Brenda, can I grab you for a second.
Come see me next week if you need more.
I signed the agreement.
My dad manipulated you into signing it.
My mother didn't kill herself.
It's over.
All I know is that Alison is running out of money and Shanna is the only one who knows how to reach her.
I'm tired of lying.
You have to start thinking of me as the person you're closest to.
Oh, A Night in Tunisia.
Forgot the chickpeas.
Oh, I can run down to Seymour's.
Are you okay, I mean, it's like an hour there and back.
Mr. Fitz.
Walk away, Spencer.
I think we're being watched.
Ezra.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
You think she started up with Ezra and didn't tell us.
- Has she told you?
- Told me what?
Aria.
Found his journal.
You're saying that Ezra left that book for us to find.
Which means he knows we know.
We have to tell Aria.
Spencer?
Spencer?
Are you alright?
How long have you been here?
I don't know.
Did you sleep here?
I don't know...
I...
I came in here.
Hey, take it easy.
Let's talk for a second.
I'm fine.
I'm just really tired, that's all.
Spencer?
We both know what's going on here.
I think it's time we address the issue... don't you?
The path you've been going down is very dangerous.
I have to go.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Hey.
What are you wearing?
It's nothing, I...
I had to change.
And this is all I had in my gym locker.
Did you?
Did you have an accident?
What?
No.
Or are you going to?
What's up with those shower shoes?
Can you just forget about the outfit, okay.
We have an emergency situation here.
Is that why you called me at 4 A.M.?
Wait, what?
Okay, I thought that after we saw Aria liplocking with the devil went home to calm down and crash.
I...
I must've just hit dial while I was asleep.
Look, okay, I know we said we were going to talk to Aria after school, but I really think we need to tell her about Ezra sooner.
Like, now.
What?
Spencer, we can't tell her now.
The longer we wait, the more dangerous it becomes.
And you think it's any less dangerous to drop a bomb like that while she's going into class?
We can't do that to her.
Do what?
Protect her?
Ezra spoke to me this morning and I could barely maintain eye contact.
Meanwhile, for all we know right now,
Aria is hooking up with him in some janitor's closet.
How does that not make your skin crawl?
It does.
Look, I know you don't want to keep her in the dark.
Okay, but this isn't going to be easy.
She's in love with him and she has given up a lot to be with him.
I mean, it's going to be difficult enough for her to believe he's even capable of this.
Aria?
You had a question about the... the reading assignment for the week?
Oh, yeah.
I was just wondering how much information we have to turn in for the exam.
Hey.
Hi.
I know you have history right now, but I can write you a late pass...
That's okay.
What's up?
Have you talked to Spencer today?
No.
No.
Why?
I feel a little strange coming to you with this.
Did something happen?
Certain things have started to... pile up.
The homework Spencer's turning in is sloppy and rambling, she walks in every morning with circles under her eyes,
I mean, when she's in class, she's either hyper alert or she's a total zombie.
Yeah, I mean, I've noticed that she's been little out of it lately.
But she's had a lot to juggle.
And you know Spencer, she's a total stress-case.
A garbanzo bean in the wrong salad bin is enough to make her her wig out.
Right.
I think it's more than that.
Like what?
She has a problem with amphetamines.
And I'm worried it's become a crutch.
What?
Ezra, that's crazy.
Well, people think it'll improve their academic performance, but when it's overused...
Ezra, come on, Spencer?
She's got everybody fooled, Aria.
Your friend is a ticking time bomb.
And when she explodes
I don't want you to get hit by the shrapnel.
I'm sorry, I can't believe it.
You really think that she's on drugs?
I don't think it.
I know it.
Look.
I wasn't going to show you this.
I guess I'm willing to break the rules if it means helping Spencer.
Aria, I'm not trying to be the bad guy here.
Hey, you.
These are Hanna's clothes.
So long story.
You want to tell me about it while we go for a ride?
I would love to, but I've this quiz right after lunch on the French succession of popes.
And right now the only thing I know about them is that they wore pointy hats.
I brought us some food.
Are you still mad at me for taking the money?
No.
No, I was never mad at you.
Disappointed.
I was, maybe a little.
Well, I don't think my mom would have been disappointed.
I think she would have wanted me to live my life.
Find a way to make it full and share it with the people I love.
You want to start by sharing a sandwich?
Yeah, sounds good.
Are you gonna eat that?
Yeah, I told you that like five seconds ago.
Just take it.
Thank you.
Sorry.
I just get...
I just get extra hungry when I'm nervous.
I thought it was sad.
I get sad when I'm nervous.
Look, I've been avoiding Aria all day.
Like I haven't.
I finished my Spanish homework in a toilet stall.
Are you sure this a good idea?
I mean, what if we tell Aria,
Ezra's "A" and then she hates us?
What choice do we have except to prepare for things to get ugly?
Finally.
Is there some cellular dead-zone that you can know about in the school?
What do you mean?
Well, I've texted you both like five times.
Whatever, where's Spencer?
I haven't seen her.
Okay.
Well, we need to find her and talk to her right now.
What about?
Right, I think we all know that Spencer's been a little... extra-intense lately.
And I'd just chalked it up to stress, but she's not just stressed.
She's strung out.
You guys, Spencer has a serious problem.
All right, and this isn't the first time that has happened.
Two years ago it was enough of an issue that her parents had to ask the school for help.
Look.
Is that okay?
I'm just really tired.
Why don't you come over tonight?
I'll get us take out from Bucali's.
Rent a movie.
Maybe even throw a massage in there if you're good and you finish all your lasagna.
That sounds amazing, I just...
I can't tonight.
Then tomorrow.
We need some time together.
I know.
That's okay.
I got that.
Thank you.
I'd almost forgotten your smell.
See you later.
Okay.
Two diets and a regular, right?
Oh my God.
You guys did it already, didn't you?
Did what?
Nothing.
We're not here to talk about that.
We're here to talk about... something else.
Spence, we're concerned.
Yeah, I know.
We're concerned.
No, we're worried about you.
Me?
Why?
Are you a speed freak?
Hanna.
Spencer.
Have you been taking pills to stay awake?
Where is this coming from?
What the hell is happening right now?
We care about you.
Yeah, would you and that's why we're here.
Right, this is kind of like an intervention.
Yeah, I know.
Yours.
Spencer, stop.
We know this has been problem for you before.
I don't know what you guys are talking about.
Where'd you get this?
Ezra.
He's worried about you.
You're kidding me, right?
And you two didn't tell her?
He's "A," Aria!
Ezra is Board Shorts.
He tried to kill Ali and he's been torturing us ever since.
Spencer, can we please stick to the subject of you for right now.
How can you not see what's happening right now.
He's trying to undermine me.
He's being "A"!
Please tell me you see what's happening here.
Ezra said that he found you passed out in school today.
That you were barefoot, you were in your pajamas, and you didn't even know where you were.
Spencer, is that true or is it not true?
Spencer?
Talk.
Yes.
Okay.
I slept walked.
- To school?
- Yes.
And I've taken a couple of pills a few times.
And it's not great, I know, but it's not that big of a deal.
And Ezra is just trying to make it into a bigger deal than it is because he's trying to get the focus off of himself because he's freaking "A"!
Oh, my God.
This is brilliant.
All right, I know that you're feeling cornered.
Oh, God, Aria.
Will you wake up?
This is exactly the kind of deer in the headlights behavior that almost got you shot in the back of a night club.
What night club?
I mean...
I am...
Okay, I'm confused, but the point is that I'm not crazy, okay.
You just don't see.
How can you guys not see what's happening.
I can't deal with this right now.
Wren?
He's your hook-up?
Why did you just swipe the pad?
It's not mine.
I've never even seen that before.
I bet you were a cute baby.
Oh, not really.
I had to start wearing corrective lenses when I was still teething.
Yeah, that sounds adorable.
No, it really wasn't.
No, I cannot believe I admitted that.
I must really like you.
Like?
I was... was kind of hoping you'd say that other word.
The one that rhymes with glove?
I didn't mean to go there.
I think the candlelight is getting to me.
So do you want to split the steak and fries or were you more into the chicken?
Mona?
A steak.
Steak sounds great.
I'll be right back.
I just...
I have to talk to Mr. Fitz about a reading assignment.
Hello, Mona.
What are you doing here?
I'm getting something to eat.
Look.
I can't help you anymore.
Why's that?
It's gotten too complicated.
It's always been complicated, Mona.
That's a little too late to back out especially now, when I need your help.
Ezra?
That's me.
Thank you.
Enjoy your dinner.
So did Aria text you?
Yeah.
She said she's staying in.
Can we believe her?
Why?
You think she's going to go see Ezra?
Spencer may have an addiction, but so does Aria.
Love is a drug too.
And who says Ezra doesn't put Aria in a... what do you call it?
- Altered state.
- Yeah, exactly.
I think Aria kept her habit a secret, too.
It's a classic druggie move.
So what are you saying?
You still think that Ezra is "A"?
There's too much evidence against him.
We found the Book of Revelations in his desk.
Yeah, but what if that was a plan from the real "A", trying to make Fitz look guilty.
"A's" does that.
Can I come in?
Please.
That's all of them.
I don't need them anymore.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Look, I know that my credibility with you guys kind of got decimated today, but Ezra is "A".
I'm sure of it.
Maybe you are.
But we're not.
I know that.
And all I'm asking is for the chance to prove it to you.
I've been studying all the changes.
And I think "A" is trying to cover up the place where he used to meet Ali.
The Hart and Huntsman?
No.
Somewhere else.
A place where they can meet and not be seen.
See this?
"Still thinking of Ambrose Pearson."
Right, but that's not what it used to say.
Originally it said "still thinking of Ambrose Pavilion."
"A" changed it so that would sound more like a person's name so that instead of looking for a location, we'd be searching for a guy.
Yeah, some weirdo named Ambrose.
Right.
So Ambrose Pavilion is in Norristown Zoo.
So how does that prove that Ezra is "A"?
It doesn't.
But "A" already knows that Ali's still alive.
And "A" knows that she never got that money in the coffee bag that she needed from Shana.
So all we have to do is convince him that Ali's going to meet us at Ambrose Pavilion to get it.
And you think the person showing up will be Ezra.
Yeah, I could do dinner if it's on the early side.
Okay, great.
I'll be leaving in five minutes.
All right, bye.
Have you been in your room all day?
Yeah.
It started out as a nap.
I'm leaving to play a round-robin with Tricia and Joan.
Wish me luck.
Good luck.
Are you still going to join us at the club for dinner?
Oh, I'm totally spaced.
Toby really wants me for dinner at his place tonight.
Okay, fine.
But at least come up with a better excuse for me to give next time.
Okay.
Love you.
Love you, too.
Good luck.
Hey, it's Toby.
Leave a message.
Hi.
It's me.
Change of plans.
My mom is forcing me to go to dinner with her country club cronies tonight so.
I might be able to make it by after, gonna be on the later side.
I mean, she was just so desperate.
At first she totally denied it, and then she just completely flew off the handle.
When I was getting my teaching certificate, they had us practice confrontations, that could be really difficult, people become really defensive.
Defensive?
No, she slid past defense and went straight to offense.
She attacked me, she attacked Emily and Hanna, and she even went as far...
She went as far as to say what?
She's just... she's out of control right now.
You know, I think it's time to tell Spencer's parents about what's going on.
Oh, god.
No, I don't want to have to do that.
If you don't, I'll have to.
And it becomes a much bigger deal if a teacher gets involved.
But can't we just let her figure this out on her own?
Aria, Spencer doesn't remember driving to school.
She could have killed someone.
I know.
I know that.
But she's a really strong person.
And I promise you, she'll get herself out of this.
At what cost?
Do you remember Radley?
Yes.
She thought she found Toby, dead in the woods.
That's exactly my point.
Seeing a motorcycle helmet and a tattoo is enough to unravel her completely.
You're right.
Hey.
How did you find out about that?
The tattoo part?
What do you mean?
I mean, how did you know that Spencer only saw the helmet and a tattoo?
I just don't think that was included in any of the reports or anything.
I think you must have told me.
Yeah.
I probably did.
Can I top you off?
Oh, no.
I'm good, Emily.
Thanks.
Hey.
Yeah, I can't talk right now.
Can I call you back?
Seriously, now is not a good time.
No, I know, I just...
I don't know if I can do it.
We don't even know if Ali's actually going to show up.
Nice.
I think he's listening.
Oh, he's definitely listening.
Okay.
Now say something like.
"I know she needs some money, but it's too dangerous."
I know she needs some money, but it's too dangerous.
Tell her to get closer to this mush fries.
Just in case he can hear.
Just mention the location and we're golden.
Yeah, I heard you.
Ambrose Pavilion closing.
I got to go.
Hi, good afternoon, this is Veronica Hastings calling on behalf of my daughter Spencer.
We were just hoping to refill her prescription today.
If you would, would you please give me a call back at...
You know, actually I'll just try you back again later.
Thank you.
Andrew.
Hi.
Hello?
Mrs. Hastings?
Yes?
I'm returning your call from Dr. Griggs's office.
Dr. Griggs?
I spoke to the doctor and he'd really be more comfortable if Spencer came in to see him before he re-ups her prescription.
There must be some mistake we haven't seen Dr. Griggs in years.
I have it here that you've called several times.
Is that right?
Mrs. Hastings?
Thanks.
I'll call you back.
We have less than an hour before closing.
Okay.
Ambrose Pavilion.
According to this, we should be right here.
Oh, over there.
Hanna.
I can't.
I'm sorry, just looking at the sign gives me heebie-jeebies.
You'll be fine.
They're all behind glass.
Hanna, come on.
There's nothing to be scared of.
Reptiles first appeared 340 million years ago in Carboniferous Period.
The snake is so cool.
Do you think it eats mice?
Yeah.
The black mamba...
Only Ali would think it's sexy to make out in front of a bunch of reptiles.
That one is sleeping.
Come on.
Can you just toss that thing so we can get out of here.
No.
We have to wait for Spencer to get into position.
Where is she?
I don't know.
She should have been here by now.
What a gyp.
There's nothing in this one except a log covered in goo.
Oh, my god.
The first thing Alison ever told me about herself was a lie.
Lying was her oxygen.
She could do it while she was laughing.
She could even do it when she was kissing you.
The zoo will close in 5 minutes.
This is Spencer's plan.
She wouldn't have gotten it wrong.
There's Spencer.
Finally, let's move.
Reptiles first appeared 340 million years ago in the Carboniferous Period.
Today recognize roughly 8,000 species of known reptiles.
__
Aria?
Aria, I know you're out there.
Why are you hiding from me?
Aria.
Aria.
Aria!
Why are you doing this?
Just come out and talk to me.
Please, just don't do this.
Please come out and talk to me.
Why isn't Spencer doing anything?
She'll make her move when she thinks "A" is here.
And you think that it's going to be Ezra who shows up?
Guess we'll find out soon.
Okay, once Spencer gives us the signal, we'll double-back.
God, you guys.
I'm so sorry, I'm late.
Just help me get this on and then I can move into position.
The lift is closing in 5 minutes.
Aria, Aria, Aria, I didn't mean for it to end this way.
Damn it!
Gosh.
She was just here.
Who was?
Let's get out of here.
The Black Mamba is the longest venomous snake in Africa...
The Brown tree snake is arboreal and terrestrial.
From hibernation.
Green Anaconda is the largest snake in the world.
Reptile black mamba is the longest venomous snake in Africa.
The zoo is closed to the general public.
You have to leave.
Sorry.
We got locked in.
We're going now.
The Anaconda is the largest snake in the world.
Help!
Somebody help me!
Stop, stop.
Please, please, I know you're upset, but just hear me out.
Don't touch me.
Why did we stop?
I know what you saw back there, and I can explain it.
You knew Alison.
You knew her.
You pretended not to, and you're...
Yes, yes.
I know, I lied.
I'm so sorry.
I wanted to tell you so many times, but I was afraid.
I was afraid that you wouldn't forgive me.
I met Alison in college.
She lied about her age and I believed her.
I don't want to hear this.
I don't want to hear it.
I just want to get off.
Aria, please, just listen to me.
Nothing you say will change anything.
I don't even know who you are.
Yes, you do.
Yes, you do.
You wanted Alison dead.
You wanted her dead.
You thought you got her pregnant.
I never hurt Alison.
I was writing a book about her.
A true crime book.
A book?
Yeah.
When I saw in the papers that she had gone missing,
I...
I couldn't stop thinking about it.
I had to get to the bottom of the story.
Did you know who I was when we met?
Yes, I did.
I knew who all of you were.
And that's why I applied to teach at Rosewood.
So that's what I was to you?
I was research?
When I saw you in the bar,
I took advantage of an opportunity because I wanted to be a good reporter.
I wanted to be the guy that would do anything for the story, but I promise you though.
I didn't know I was going to fall in love with you.
Don't.
I lied about a lot of things.
Ezra, don't!
I lied about a lot of things.
But I have never lied to you, not once about how I feel about you.
When we started getting serious,
I stopped writing the book.
I started my research back up again when we broke up and that's how I knew that Alison was still alive.
When I think about how I defended you to my family and my friends.
And the whole time you were... you were using me.
I'm sorry, I'm such an idiot.
I'm such an idiot.
I'm a jerk.
But I swear, I'll burn this, I'll trash it.
Burn it?
Burn it?
Are you kidding me?
I'm going to read this thing from cover to cover.
Aria, please don't.
No.
No, I want to know what was worth destroying everything we had for.
Look.
No!
I was going to say you missed half the movie, but that was like 20 minutes ago.
I'm sorry.
Kind of lost track of time.
Well, can we watch the rest?
I don't mind being a little lost.
Well, you won't be.
Movie is about a creepy guy who makes creepy sculptures and acts creepy about it.
I'm gonna get a refill.
You want something?
No, thanks.
Aria?
Are you okay?
Toby.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Your mom was worried about you.
Why would my mom be worried about me?
She called me, looking for you.
I wish you could have told me what was really going on, instead of me finding out this way.
Spencer?
Is that you?
I guess I'll give you guys some time to talk.
This is for you.
There was a whole dinner that went with it, but... doesn't matter.
Wait, Toby.
Can you just wait a second?
I wasn't trying to ditch you.
Goodbye, Toby.
Thank you for coming over.
Good night, Mrs. Hastings.
Mom, why did you ask Toby here?
You promised.
You promised you wouldn't go back to this again.
Go back to what?
I don't know what you mean.
Spencer, stop it.
Dr. Griggs's office called, I know.
Mom, I'm sorry.
I can't go through this with you again.
I just don't think I have it in me.
It's not like last time though, I swear.
You didn't know what you were doing half the time.
And your father and I can't cover for you again, not with Radley on your resume.
What's that supposed to mean?
I need to call your father.
Let him know you're okay.
It sounds like Toby had a beautiful evening planned.
It's too bad you missed it.
NARRATOR:
Previously on Pretty Little Liars.
I'm cutting you off, you're over caffeinated.
Hey, Brenda, can I grab you for a second.
Come see me next week if you need more.
I signed the agreement.
My dad manipulated you into signing it.
My mother didn't kill herself.
It's over.
All I know is that Alison is running out of money and Shanna is the only one who knows how to reach her.
I'm tired of lying.
You have to start thinking of me as the person you're closest to.
Oh, A Night in Tunisia.
Forgot the chickpeas.
Oh, I can run down to Seymour's.
EZRA:
Are you okay, I mean, it's like an hour there and back.
Mr. Fitz.
Want to go right, Spencer.
I think we're being watched.
Ezra.
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to scare you.
You think she started up with Ezra and didn't tell us.
- Had she told you?
- Told me what?
Aria.
(gun shot)
Found his journal.
You're saying that Ezra left that book for us to find.
Which means he knows we know.
We have to tell Aria.
(clock ticking)
EZRA:
Spencer?
Spencer?
Are you alright?
How long have you been here?
I don't know.
Did you sleep here?
I don't know...
I...
I came in here.
Hey, take it easy.
Let's talk for a second.
I'm fine.
I'm just really tired, that's all.
Spencer?
We both know what's going on here.
I think it's time we address the issue... don't you?
The path you've been going down is very dangerous.
(Bell rings)
I got to go.

Hey.
HANNA:
What are you wearing?
It's nothing, I...
I had to change.
And this is all I had in my gym locker.
Did you?
Did you have an accident?
What?
No.
Or are you going to?
What's up with those shower shoes?
Can you just forget about the outfit, okay.
We have an emergency situation here.
Is that why you called me at 4 A.M.?
Wait, what?
Okay, I thought that after we saw Aria liplocking with the devil went home to calm down and crash.
I...
I must've just hit dial while I was asleep.
Look, okay, I know we said we were going to talk to Aria after school, but I really think we need to tell her about Ezra sooner.
Like, now.
What?
Spencer, we can't tell her now.
The longer we wait, the more dangerous it becomes.
And you think it's any less dangerous to drop a bomb like that while she's going into class?
We can't do that to her.
Do what?
Protect her?
Ezra spoke to me this morning and I could barely maintain eye contact.
Meanwhile, for all we know right now,
Aria is hooking up with him in some janitor's closet.
How does that not make your skin crawl?
It does.
Look, I know you don't want to keep her in the dark.
Okay, but this isn't going to be easy.
She's in love with him and she has given up a lot to be with him.
I mean, it's going to be difficult enough for her to believe he's even capable of this.
(bell rings)
Aria?
You had a question about the... the reading assignment for the week?
Oh, yeah.
I was just wondering how much information we have to turn in for the exam.
Hey.
Hi.
I know you have history right now, but I can write you a late pass...
That's okay.
What's up?
Have you talked to Spencer today?
No.
No.
Why?
I feel a little strange coming to you with this.
Did something happen?
Certain things have started to... pile up.
The homework Spencer's turning in is sloppy and rambling, she walks in every morning with circles under her eyes,
I mean, when she's in class, she's either hyper alert or she's a total zombie.
Yeah, I mean, I've noticed that she's been little out of it lately.
But she's had a lot to juggle.
And you know Spencer, she's a total stress-case.
A garbanzo bean in the wrong salad bin is enough to make her her wig out.
Right.
I think it's more than that.
Like what?
She has a problem with amphetamines.
And I'm worried it's become a crutch.
What?
Ezra, that's crazy.
Well, people think it'll improve their academic performance, but when it's overused...
Ezra, come on, Spencer?
She's got everybody fooled, Aria.
Your friend is a ticking time bomb.
And when she explodes
I don't want you to get hit by the shrapnel.
I'm sorry, I can't believe it.
You really think that she's on drugs?
I don't think it.
I know it.
Look.
I wasn't going to show you this.
I guess I'm willing to break the rules if it means helping Spencer.
Aria, I'm not trying to be the bad guy here.
Hey, you.
These are Hanna's clothes.
So long story.
You want to tell me about it while we go for a ride?
I would love to, but I've this quiz right after lunch on the French succession of popes.
And right now the only thing I know about them is that they wore pointy hats.
I brought us some food.
Are you still mad at me for taking the money?
No.
No, I was never mad at you.
Disappointed.
I was, maybe a little.
Well, I don't think my mom would have been disappointed.
I think she would have wanted me to live my life.
Find a way to make it full and share it with the people I love.
You want to start by sharing a sandwich?
Yeah, sounds good.
Are you gonna eat that?
Yeah, I told you that like five seconds ago.
Just take it.
Thank you.
Sorry.
I just get...
I just get extra hungry when I'm nervous.
I thought it was sad.
I get sad when I'm nervous.
Look, I've been avoiding Aria all day.
Like I haven't.
I finished my Spanish homework in a toilet stall.
Are you sure this a good idea?
I mean, what if we tell Aria,
Ezra's "A" and then she hates us?
What choice do we have except to prepare for things to get ugly?
Finally.
Is there some cellular dead-zone that you can know about in the school?
What do you mean?
Well, I've texted you both like five times.
Whatever, where's Spencer?
I haven't seen her.
Okay.
Well, we need to find her and talk to her right now.
What about?
Right, I think we all know that Spencer's been a little... extra-intense lately.
And I'd just chalked it up to stress, but she's not distressed.
She's strung out.
You guys, Spencer has a serious problem.
All right, and this isn't the first time that has happened.
Two years ago it was enough of an issue that her parents had to ask the school for help.
Look.
Is that okay?
I'm just really tired.
Why don't you come over tonight?
I'll get us take out from Bucali's.
Rent a movie.
Maybe even throw a massage in there if you're good and you finish all your lasagna.
That sounds amazing, I just...
I can't tonight.
Then tomorrow.
We need some time together.
I know.
(Bell rings)
That's okay.
I got that.
Thank you.
I'd almost forgotten your smell.
See you later.
SPENCER:
Okay.
Two diets and a regular, right?
Oh my God.
You guys did it already, didn't you?
Did what?
Nothing.
We're not here to talk about that.
We're here to talk about... something else.
Spence, we're concerned.
Yeah, I know.
We're concerned.
No, we're worried about you.
Me?
Why?
Are you a speed freak?
Hanna.
Spencer.
Have you been taking pills to stay awake?
Where is this coming from?
What the hell is happening right now?
We care about you.
Yeah, would you and that's why we're here.
Right, this is kind of like an intervention.
Yeah, I know.
Yours.
Spencer, stop.
We know this has been problem for you before.
I don't know what you guys are talking about.
Where'd you get this?
Ezra.
He's worried about you.
You're kidding me, right?
And you two didn't tell her?
He's "A," Aria!
Ezra is Board Shorts.
He tried to kill Ali and he's been torturing us ever since.
Spencer, can we please stick to the subject of you for right now.
How can you not see what's happening right now.
He's trying to undermine me.
He's being "A"!
Please tell me you see what's happening here.
Ezra said that he found you passed out in school today.
That you were barefoot, you were in your pajamas, and you didn't even know where you were.
Spencer, is that true or is it not true?
HANNA:
Spencer?
Talk.
Yes.
Okay.
I slept walked.
- To school?
- Yes.
And I've taken a couple of pills a few times.
And it's not great, I know, but it's not that big of a deal.
And Ezra is just trying to make it into a bigger deal than it is because he's trying to get the focus off himself because he's freaking "A"!
Oh, my God.
This is brilliant.
All right, I know that you're feeling cornered.
Oh, God, Aria.
Will you wake up?
This is exactly the kind of deer in the headlights behavior that almost got you shot in the back of a night club.
What night club?
I mean...
I am...
Okay, I'm confused, but the point is that I'm not crazy, okay.
You just don't see.
How can you guys not see what's happening.
I can't deal with this right now.
Wren?
He's your hook-up?
Why did you just swipe the pad?
It's not mine.
I've never even seen that before.
MIKE:
I bet you were a cute baby.
Oh, not really.
I had to start wearing corrective lenses when I was still teething.
Yeah, that sounds adorable.
No, it really wasn't.
No, I cannot believe I admitted that.
I must really like you.
Like?
I was... was kind of hoping you'd say that other word.
The one that rhymes with glove?
I didn't mean to go there.
I think the candlelight is getting to me.
So do you want to split the steak and fries or were you more into the chicken?
Mona?
A steak.
Steak sounds great.
I'll be right back.
I just...
I have to talk to Mr. Fitz about a reading assignment.
Hello, Mona.
What are you doing here?
I'm getting something to eat.
Look.
I can't help you anymore.
Why's that?
It's gotten too complicated.
It's always been complicated, Mona.
That's a little too late to back out especially now, when I need your help.
MAN:
Ezra?
That's me.
Thank you.
Enjoy your dinner.
So did Aria text you?
Yeah.
She said she's staying in.
Can we believe her?
Why?
You think she's going to go see Ezra?
Spencer may have an addiction, but so does Aria.
Love is a drug too.
And who says Ezra doesn't put Aria in a... what do you call it?
- Altered state.
- Yeah, exactly.
I think Aria kept her habit a secret, too.
It's a classic druggie move.
So what are you saying?
You still think that Ezra is "A"?
There's too much evidence against him.
We found the Book of Revelations in his desk.
Yeah, but what if that was a plan from the real "A", trying to make Fitz look guilty.
"A's" does that.
(Door Knocking)
Can I come in?
Please.
That's all of them.
I don't need them anymore.
Are you sure?
Yeah.
Look, I know that my credibility with you guys kind of got decimated today, but Ezra is "A".
I'm sure of it.
Maybe you are.
But we're not.
I know that.
And all I'm asking is for the chance to prove it to you.
I've been studying all the changes.
And I think "A" is trying to cover up the place where he used to meet Ali.
The Hart and Huntsman?
No.
Somewhere else.
A place where they can meet and not be seen.
See this?
"Still thinking of Ambrose Pearson."
Right, but that's not what it used to say.
Originally it said "still thinking of Ambrose Pavilion."
"A" changed it so that would sound more like a person's name so that instead of looking for a location, we'd be searching for a guy.
Yeah, some weirdo named Ambrose.
Right.
So Ambrose Pavilion is in Norristown Zoo.
So how does that prove that Ezra is "A"?
It doesn't.
But "A" already knows that Ali's still alive.
And "A" knows that she never got that money in the coffee bag that she needed from Shana.
So all we have to do is convince him that Ali's going to meet us at Ambrose Pavilion to get it.
And you think the person showing up will be Ezra.
Yeah, I could do dinner if it's on the early side.
Okay, great.
I'll be leaving in five minutes.
All right, bye.
Have you been in your room all day?
Yeah.
It started out as a nap.
I'm leaving to play a round-robin with Tricia and Joan.
Wish me luck.
Good luck.
Are you still going to join us at the club for dinner?
Oh, I'm totally spaced.
Toby really wants me for dinner at his place tonight.
Okay, fine.
But at least come up with a better excuse for me to give next time.
Okay.
Love you.
Love you, too.
Good luck.
(Phone rings)
VOICEMAIL:
Hey, it's Toby.
Leave message.
Hi.
It's me.
Change of plans.
My mom is forcing me to go to dinner with her country club cronies tonight so.
I might be able to make it by after, gonna be on the later side.
I mean, she was just so desperate.
At first she totally denied it, and then she just completely flew off the handle.
When I was getting my teaching certificate, they had us practice confrontations, that could be really difficult, people become really defensive.
Defensive?
No, she slid past defense and went straight to offense.
She attacked me, she attacked Emily and Hanna, and she even went as far...
She went as far as to say what?
She's just... she's out of control right now.
You know, I think it's time to tell Spencer's parents about what's going on.
Oh, god.
No, I don't want to have to do that.
If you don't, I'll have to.
And it becomes a much bigger deal if a teacher gets involved.
But can't we just let her figure this out on her own?
Aria, Spencer doesn't remember driving to school.
She could have killed someone.
I know.
I know that.
But she's a really strong person.
And I promise you, she'll get herself out of this.
At what cost?
Do you remember Radley?
Yes.
She thought she found Toby, dead in the woods.
That's exactly my point.
Seeing a motorcycle helmet and a tattoo is enough to unravel her completely.
You're right.
Hey.
How did you find out about that?
The tattoo part?
What do you mean?
I mean, how did you know that Spencer only saw the helmet and a tattoo?
I just don't think that was included in any of the reports or anything.
I think you must have told me.
Yeah.
I probably did.
Can I top you off?
Oh, no.
I'm good, Emily.
Thanks.
(Phone rings)
Hey.
Yeah, I can't talk right now.
Can I call you back?
Seriously, now is not a good time.
No, I know, I just...
I don't know if I can do it.
We don't even know if Ali's actually going to show up.
Nice.
I think he's listening.
Oh, he's definitely listening.
Okay.
Now say something like.
"I know she needs some money, but it's too dangerous."
EMILY (on phone):
I know she needs some money, but it's too dangerous.
Tell her to get closer to this mush fries.
Just in case he can hear.
Just mention the location...
Yeah, I heard you.
Ambrose Pavilion closing.
I got to go.
Hi, good afternoon, this is Veronica Hastings calling on behalf of my daughter Spencer.
We were just hoping to refill her prescription today.
If you would, would you please give me a call back at...
You know, actually I'll just try you back again later.
Thank you.
(Phone rings)
Andrew.
Hi.
(Phone rings)
Hello?
RECEPTIONIST:
Mrs. Hastings?
Yes?
I'm returning your call from Dr. Griggs's office.
Dr. Griggs?
I spoke to the doctor and he'd really be more comfortable if Spencer came in to see him before he re-ups her prescription.
There must be some mistake we haven't seen Dr. Griggs in years.
I have it here that you've called several times.
Is that right?
Mrs. Hastings?
Thanks.
I'll call you back.
We have less than an hour before closing.
Okay.
Ambrose Pavilion.
According to this, we should be right here.
Oh, over there.
Hanna.
I can't.
I'm sorry, just looking at the sign gives me heebie-jeebies.
You'll be fine.
They're all behind glass.
Hanna, come on.
There's nothing to be scared of.
AUDIO GUIDE:
Reptiles first appeared 340 million years ago in Carboniferous Period.
The snake is so cool.
Do you think it eats mice?
Yeah.
The black mamba...
Only Ali would think it's sexy to make out in front of a bunch of reptiles.
BOY:
That one is sleeping.
Come on.
Can you just toss that thing so we can get out of here.
No.
We have to wait for Spencer to get into position.
Where is she?
I don't know.
She should have been here by now.
What a gyp.
There's nothing in this one except a log covered in goo.
Oh, my god.
EZRA'S VOICE:
The first thing Alison ever told me about herself was a lie.
Lying was her oxygen.
She could do it while she was laughing.
She could even do it when she was kissing you.
ANNOUNCEMENT:
The zoo will close in 5 minutes.
This is Spencer's plan.
She wouldn't have gotten it wrong.
HANNA:
There's Spencer.
Finally, let's move.
Reptiles first appeared 340 million years ago in the Carboniferous Period.
Today recognize roughly 8,000 species of known reptiles.

EZRA:
Aria?
Aria, I know you're out there.
Why are you hiding from me?
Aria.
(Phone rings)
Aria.
Aria!
Why are you doing this?
Just come out and talk to me.
Please, just don't do this.
Please come out and talk to me.
Why isn't Spencer doing anything?
She'll make her move when she thinks "A" is here.
And you think that it's going to be Ezra who shows up?
Guess we'll find out soon.
Okay, once Spencer gives us the signal, we'll double-back.
God, you guys.
I'm so sorry, I'm late.
Just help me get this on and then I can move into position.
AUDIO GUIDE:
The lift is closing in 5 minutes.
Aria, Aria, Aria, I didn't mean for it to end this way.
Damn it!
Gosh.
She was just here.
Who was?
Let's get out of here.
AUDIO GUIDE:
The Black Mamba is the longest venomous snake in Africa...
The Brown tree snake is arboreal and terrestrial.
From hibernation.
Green Anaconda is the largest snake in the world.
Reptile black mamba is the longest venomous snake in Africa.
The zoo is closed to the general public.
You have to leave.
Sorry.
We got locked in.
We're going now.
The Anaconda is the largest snake in the world.
Help!
Somebody help me!
Stop, stop.
Please, please, I know you're upset, but just hear me out.
Don't touch me.
Why did we stop?
I know what you saw back there, and I can explain it.
You knew Alison.
You knew her.
You pretended not to, and you're...
Yes, yes.
I know, I lied.
I'm so sorry.
I wanted to tell you so many times, but I was afraid.
I was afraid that you wouldn't forgive me.
I met Alison in college.
She lied about her age and I believed her.
I don't want to hear this.
I don't want to hear it.
I just want to get off.
Aria, please, just listen to me.
Nothing you say will change anything.
I don't even know who you are.
Yes, you do.
Yes, you do.
You wanted Alison dead.
You wanted her dead.
You thought you got her pregnant.
I never hurt Alison.
I was writing a book about her.
A true crime book.
A book?
Yeah.
When I saw in the papers that she had gone missing,
I...
I couldn't stop thinking about it.
I had to get to the bottom of the story.
Did you know who I was when we met?
Yes, I did.
I knew who all of you were.
And that's why I applied to teach at Rosewood.
So that's what I was to you?
I was research?
When I saw you in the bar,
I took advantage of an opportunity because I wanted to be a good reporter.
I wanted to be the guy that would do anything for the story, but I promise you though.
I didn't know I was going to fall in love with you.
Don't.
I lied about a lot of things.
Ezra, don't!
I lied about a lot of things.
But I have never lied to you, not once about how I feel about you.
When we started getting serious,
I stopped writing the book.
I started my research back up again when we broke up and that's how I knew that Alison was still alive.
When I think about how I defended you to my family and my friends.
And the whole time you were... you were using me.
I'm sorry, I'm such an idiot.
I'm such an idiot.
I'm a jerk.
But I swear, I'll burn this, I'll trash it.
Burn it?
Burn it?
Are you kidding me?
I'm going to read this thing from cover to cover.
Aria, please don't.
No.
No, I want to know what was worth destroying everything we had for.
Look.
No!
I was going to say you missed half the movie, but that was like 20 minutes ago.
I'm sorry.
Kind of lost track of time.
Well, can we watch the rest?
I don't mind being a little lost.
Well, you won't be.
Movie is about a creepy guy who makes creepy sculptures and acts creepy about it.
I'm gonna get a refill.
You want something?
No, thanks.
Aria?
Are you okay?
Toby.
Hey, what are you doing here?
Your mom was worried about you.
Why would my mom be worried about me?
She called me, looking for you.
I wish you could have told me what was really going on, instead of me finding out this way.
VERONICA:
Spencer?
Is that you?
I guess I'll give you guys some time to talk.
This is for you.
There was a whole dinner that went with it, but... doesn't matter.
Wait, Toby.
Can you just wait a second?
I wasn't trying to ditch you.
Goodbye, Toby.
Thank you for coming over.
Good night, Mrs. Hastings.
Mom, why did you ask Toby here?
You promised.
You promised you wouldn't go back to this again.
Go back to what?
I don't know what you mean.
Spencer, stop it.
Dr. Griggs's office called, I know.
Mom, I'm sorry.
I can't go through this with you again.
I just don't think I have it in me.
It's not like last time though, I swear.
You didn't know what you were doing half the time.
And your father and I can't cover for you again, not with Radley on your resume.
What's that supposed to mean?
I need to call your father.
Let him know you're okay.
It sounds like Toby had a beautiful evening planned.
It's too bad you missed it.

Stop...
Please, please, I know you're upset, but just hear me up.
Don't touch me!
Why are we stopped?
!
I know what you saw back there, and I can explain it.
You knew Alison.
You knew her, you pretended not to, and you...
Yeah.
Yes, I know.
I'd lied.
I am so sorry, I wanted to tell you so many times, but I...
I was afraid!
I was afraid that you wouldn't forgive me.
I met Alison in college.
She lied about her age, and I--
I believed her.
I don't wanna hear this,
I don't wanna hear it, I just want to get off!
Aria, please, just listen to me...
Nothing you say will change anything!
I don't even know who you are!
Yes, you do.
Yes, you do.
You wanted Alison dead.
You wanted her dead, you thought you got her pregnant!

A book?
Yeah.

Then that's what I was to you, huh?
I was research.

That would do anything for the story.
And I-
- I, but I promise you.
I didn't know I was going to fall in love with you.
Don't.
I-
- I lied about a lot of things...
Ezra, don't!
I've lied about a lot of things...
But I have never lied to you, not once,
About how I feel about you.

I stopped writing the book!

-Aria...
Aria, please don't.
No.
No, I wanna know what was worth destroying everything we had for!
- Aria, look...
- No!
Ripped By mstoll
Evening.
You?
You know, it would be nice if for just once in my life a lady wasn't disappointed to see me.
Climb in the back.
Is it much further?
We'll be there in no time.
I'd like to know exactly where it is we're going.
I'm not gonna say.
Don't you worry.
It's safe.
None of your fancy society types will be taking an evening stroll anywhere nearby.
But it wouldn't matter.
I've had more than my fair share of your type needing my services.
Makes sense.
In What way?
Well, matters of the flesh.
Don't really matter how fancy the table is you're sitting at, everyone gets hungry.
With the amount of time you rich ladies spend making yourself pretty, it's no surprise someone wanted to put that to good use.
Men, they want what they want when they want it.
Then you all come to Cleary for the fix.
You promised it wasn't you who'd perform it.
You can relax.
It ain't me.
It's better.
This ain't the place for joking, Cleary.
It ain't no joke, I swear.
She's a paying customer like all the rest.
You're the...
Yes, I'm the one who does it.
You don't want this rhinoceros doing it, do you?
But you're...
And you're a pretty, proper virgin on the cusp of her wedding day.
We're friends, Harry.
You could have told me.
So could you.
But then neither of us could, could we?
This is where you leave, Tom.
Ah!
Could have done without him in the middle of this.
Never wanted him there in the first place.
You don't have to do this.
Yes, I do.
You'll be married soon.
You can tell anyone who can count to nine that it happened on your wedding night.
I'll be your midwife and vouch for the baby coming early.
No, this has to happen here tonight.
I can only find the courage to ask for this just so many times.
At least talk to Phillip about it.
He may see things differently.
I'll get you through it as quick as I can, little daughter.
A tumor has amassed at the base of the skull which is the cause of the patient's terrible pain.
By trepanning,
I hope to relieve some of that pressure.
As you can see, my assessment is correct.
As the brain's fluid is immediately being forced out through the opening.
Syringe.
In order to keep the intracranial pressure at bay, it is my opinion that the hole I've just created should remain open
even after the operation.
And now on to the tumor.
Surgical knife.
This is our surgical preparation room.
Good afternoon, doctors.
Good afternoon, Dr. Zinberg.
Taking a tour of our old gal?
She's been through quite a few battles, but we've managed to keep her afloat.
Isn't that right, Thack?
Dr. Zinberg is making the rounds at all of the city's hospitals.
He's hoping to promote greater cooperation between the surgeons.
Curiously, I found our New York brethren much less willing than my previous ones in Chicago.
Well, I think that's changing, thanks to you.
My father and I recently sat in on the pulmonary abscess procedure you did on your last visit to New York Hospital.
He used what looked like this impossible suture of both layers of the parietal.
It was very, very impressive.
Dr. Zinberg has agreed to perform a surgery for us here at the Knick.
Really?
Who invited him?
Mr. Habershorn from the board.
Seems they've heard wonderful things from Dr. Zinberg's patron, Mr. Loeb, and wanted us to see for ourselves.
Well, you must remind me to send Mr. Habershorn a note.
Well, you'll be a hard act to follow, Dr. Thackery.
Your choice of leaving the skull open is... intriguing.
I've always been a believer in osteoplasty, but this contradicts that.
Well, time will tell if my contradiction is correct.
Well, naturally, there are foreseeable complications.
I'd like to try it out on my next tumor patient.
Modify it.
Perhaps we can share our findings.
If that's all right with you, of course.
No, it's not.
Physicians and other disciplines believe the mind is not a place where sickness can fester, but I assure you it can.
This way, please.
Disorders of the mind must not be treated casually.
Indeed, we must be aggressive if our patients are to improve.
Of course, Dr. Cotton.
Step in.
I'm grateful for you taking on my wife.
Well, it came at the request of our teacher Dr. Meyer at Johns Hopkins.
There's no man I more admire.
- Henry.
- Huh?
Whatever the cost, our families are willing to pay it.
I want the best possible care for Eleanor.
Oh.
Well, she's receiving it.
Please.
Eleanor, you have a visitor.
Hello, sweetheart.
Eleanor.
Eleanor, it's me, Everett.
- Everett.
- In God's name...
What in the hell happened?
It's all part of the treatment.
- We pulled all of her teeth.
- Why?
My research has shown conclusively that all mental disorders stem from disease and infection polluting the brain.
So, the teeth and gums are havens for bacteria and sepsis.
Thus, to cure the patient, we must rid the body of all sites of infection.
But her teeth?
She is a beautiful woman.
Who has gone mad.
Now, you must see this as a kindness.
Her teeth had to go.
I believe in this treatment so strongly that I have removed my own children's teeth as a preventative measure.
So this is common practice?
It is not generally accepted.
My colleagues thus far choose to remain in the Dark Ages, but I'm confident when my results come in, they'll soon adopt my technique.
Then it's been effective?
Not as yet.
But we've only begun to attack the sites of infection.
I think her tonsils and adenoids will have to come out.
And if that fails to bring improvement, her colon will have to go as well.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Jesus.
Get off him, Junia.
Fuck.
That's more than I expected from you, Herm.
But what I got in my pocket is less than I expected from you.
You missed a payment again.
I thought after the favor I did you at the hospital...
You don't miss a payment!
I made that clear, you dim fuck.
And then you come to my place and blow money on whores?
I just wanted to see my girl.
She's my girl.
They're all my girls!
And that was my money you spent to plug my girl.
Show him a blue burner, Jimmy.
- No, no, no, no.
- Take 'em away!
Or I'll give you 10 like you won't forget.
Please.
Oh, fuck.
Nothing breaks a man like a good cock punch.
Seen it kill a fellow once.
Your change purse seems to be holding its own, though, Herm.
But it's swelling.
To the size of a billposter's bucket.
I'm tacking on a grand for being late and doubling your rate for it being a repeated offense.
I'll get some ice.
Stir that gravy, Duchess.
Don't want the sugar in there to candy up.
Yes, ma'am.
Joella, take that turkey out, but don't carve it yet.
That meat needs to rest.
Algie, you come to help your mama?
Oh, I'd only get in the way.
Don't let him fool you, girls.
This boy can cook as good as his mama taught him to.
Glazes a ham better than any of them chefs over in Paris.
Thought I'd come by a little early for the lunch today.
Is Cornelia out of her room yet?
Woke up feeling bad.
Been sitting in the parlor.
Girl has the wedding jitters if you ask me.
I'll check on her.
Always so considerate.
No one can see in.
They can all see in.
Are you...
Are you all right?
It's done.
Was it terrible?
It was our child.
I wanted to be there with you.
I did.
But I couldn't.
You understand?
I think we made a mistake.
Yes, our affair was the mistake.
No.
You were looking for a risk to take and I just happened to be it.
- No, that is not true.
- That is true.
Now we are living with the consequences of that.
And we should be grateful to have escaped with our skin.
Now we have to be realistic.
I don't want to be realistic.
You never have wanted to be realistic.
You will marry Phillip.
He's a good man and the two of you will have many splendid, healthy children together.
And this...
All of this mess will barely be a memory.
No.
I don't think I should attend the luncheon today.
Please convey my regrets.
In front of you is a man, age 32, suffering from splenic anemia.
Now this is evident in the slight green coloration of the skin.
This disease is rare, insidious, and up until now prognosis was anything but hopeful.
Unfortunately, gentlemen, it is only too true that the entire subject of blood making and blood breaking is as yet very imperfectly understood.
But I believe the answer lies right in the name of the disease itself.
The spleen.
I thought you were at lunch at the Robertsons'.
This seemed more interesting.
Where are the atomizers?
He doesn't use them.
He says they're as modern as dinosaurs.
I am now going to separate the spleen from the splenic artery.
Suction.
More clamps, if you please.
We are through.
The patient still has a long road of convalescing ahead of him.
And we have a long road ahead of us in fully understanding this disease and how our blood behaves.
However, we may not be as far off as we once believed.
My distinguished colleague Dr. Karl Landsteiner of Vienna and I have been working together.
And if our experiments continue to prove successful, we will soon propose to you, gentlemen, that we are not of all the same blood, but, in fact, of three distinct bloods.
The question is why do transfusions fail?
Multiple reasons.
The principle being that the transfused blood begins clotting in the new body, immediately killing the recipient.
And that is where we'll start unlocking the mystery.
I'll need both your bloods.
For what purpose?
For the purpose of beating Zinberg and not allowing him to bask in another triumph.
This is one of the main focuses of his research.
He's already around the track and we are at the starting line.
Look, the man upstaged us at the medical conference.
Our exceptional hernia presentation had to play second fiddle to his gadget.
He then arrives at our theater acting all innocent when it is clear that his only intention is to spy and to steal.
There is a difference between wishing to learn and collaborate and looking to steal another man's work.
Zinberg is a thief!
He's a fake.
He steals other people's work and he passes it off as his own.
And I am not allowing him to do it again.
From now on, this will be my main focus.
Beginning today, Dr. Edwards, you will take the lead in all surgeries while I concentrate on this.
Um...
Until when?
Until we win one of those new Nobel Prizes.
Dr. Thackery.
Dr. Thackery.
You need to take a moment and consider yourself.
You are, if I may say, acting irrationally.
And I...
I think the cause may be more pharmaceutical in nature than you realize.
I did not ask what you think.
I told you what to do.
- Bertie.
- Yes?
Come here.
You much of a bleeder?
- I don't believe so.
- Hold still.
Okay.
Oh!
Ow!
Yes.
I'm gonna need you for a special assignment.
Okay.
You've got to find out everything you can about Zinberg.
What he's doing, how far along he is in his research.
How?
Well, he's a man who believes in sharing.
Test that theory.
I need to speak with you urgently.
In private.
I want you to introduce me to your Chinaman.
Who?
The one they brought in here after you saved his life.
I need you to call in the favor he owes you.
Why?
For what?
I want him to kill Bunky Collier for me.
What are you talking about?
You have to ask him for me.
I have no choice.
What is this?
What have...
What have you gotten yourself into?
I owe him.
I owe him nearly $10,000 and it's growing every day.
Every minute that we stand here,
I'm incurring more debt than any man could fairly pay in a lifetime.
And you want me to ask a favor of Ping Wu?
You're talking about bargaining with the devil, Herman.
You know, Wu is not a man to get involved with.
He doesn't believe he can die.
And from the scars on him, he might be telling the truth.
Oh...
- It's lovely.
- Thank you.
Ivory?
Yes, it's carved from the tusk of the elephant Frederick shot on safari last year.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Perfectly exquisite.
And now for something old.
Eunice.
Oh, they're stunning.
They belonged to Hobart's mother,
Phillip's grandmother.
It was Hobart who thought you'd look beautiful in them.
Thank you.
Use them well.
I will.
Everett.
Everett.
What the hell?
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen, stop this right now!
What is going on here?
He attacked me!
- You destroyed my life!
- You destroyed yourself.
Dr. Gallinger, you are suspended from service until you straighten yourself out.
Everett.
Everett.
- For God's sake, man...
- John, you gave up on me.
Edwards was not my hire.
You were my choice.
And if you had to make that choice again, would I still be it?
I didn't think so.
Take some time.
Go home, collect yourself.
Come back a new man who can give Edwards a run for his money.
Go home to what?
You were all I had left.
Now look at you.
Don't you look antiseptic.
Perhaps you can complete your task by sneezing into my patient.
Earlier, you spoke of the coagulation problem in transfusion.
Now it's been accepted into fact that normal blood takes 9.28 minutes to coagulate.
You are conversing with me about your experiments now?
How much more evidence of your absurd behavior do you need?
I am on to something that cannot wait.
So normal blood takes 9.28 minutes to coagulate, but if you administer citric acid, then that time increases.
That could mean that each individual has varying levels of citric acid in their blood which we have yet to discover.
Yes, but the coagulation time also increases with certain diseases.
Tuberculosis or leukemia, for example.
And decreases with others.
How do you explain that, then?
Silk suture, please.
I want blood samples from everyone on the ward.
Not the patients.
The nurses and the orderlies.
I'm glad you contacted me, Dr. Chickering.
Well, my father's been after me about it for a while now.
Well, he only wants a good situation for you.
And I have that with Thackery.
Yet here you sit.
I won't take a pupil from his mentor, despite your father's request that I do so.
Well, he doesn't quite understand.
Dr. Thackery must be a good man and an excellent influence for you to have such loyalty.
I wanted to collaborate with Thackery.
Your brain surgery, our blood work.
Your hernia and previa procedures, our endoscope.
We could have been excellent partners.
I don't think Thackery believed you were being sincere.
I only want to solve problems and help people.
I'm sure Dr. Thackery feels similarly.
Of course.
We're close on the blood types.
We're learning more every day.
Imagine being able to safely transfuse.
The lives saved.
But we're stuck.
The final hurdle is proving harder to negotiate than we imagined.
What's this?
It's what I was going to present to the next society meeting.
It's what we have so far.
Call it a show of good faith.
I'm not concerned with who figures it out as long as it gets solved.
Ch.
I don't know what to say.
Say you'll help us.
If Thackery agrees to collaborate, put our minds together and find the answer, the documents are his.
If not...
I will trust you to do with them what you think is right.
Why did Thackery not come?
Why did he send you?
Do you mind if we speak alone?
This is not an average request.
Thackery works for me.
And I need to protect him.
And if this goes wrong, it can't lead back to him.
That's why I'm here instead.
What does he want?
To have you make good on your debt to him for saving your life.
He owes a great deal of money to Bunky Collier.
And Collier's threatened Thack's life.
Abused him terribly.
He's beaten him, humiliated him,
and dealt with him unfairly.
He wants Collier dead.
He said that?
His words?
Are you sure that's what he wants?
Very.
Let me take you home.
We can sleep and see how it looks to you in the morning.
No.
He's too far ahead.
He could be getting ready to publish next week.
Would you fetch me some of my medicine, please?
What?
I don't like what it's doing to you.
I don't care what you like.
I need to work.
I need to concentrate.
So, please, just do as you're told.
- John...
- Now, Nurse Elkins.
You see what it's doing to him?
I do.
Then leave it here.
- Let him go without it.
- I can't.
You haven't seen the alternative.
I have.
It's much worse.
Excuse me.
Neely, I told him.
I told Phillip if he presented San Francisco as a fait accompli, you would feel the way you're feeling now.
- What are you going to do?
- What do you mean?
Are you getting married tomorrow?
I have to.
Neely, doll.
You're a Robertson.
There are ways.
Can we talk about you, please?
How are you?
How's San Francisco?
I don't know if you've noticed, but Dad isn't...
Isn't Dad anymore.
He's not...
Not the same.
Has something happened between you two?
No.
No, I'm talking about the business.
When I arrived in San Francisco, things were a mess.
I spent most of the last year trying to renegotiate some of the deals he made.
They would have proved fatal to the company if I hadn't.
If that's true, it makes me sad.
Me, too.
Oh!
Good morning, miss.
I didn't expect to find you awake.
Couldn't sleep.
- It is a big day.
- Yes.
After you, sir.
Everything you could ever want.
- Morning, Harry.
- Thomas.
Lot of good stuff in these Sears catalogs.
You get pianos, headstones, ovens.
- You looking for anything?
- What do you mean?
Something for yourself.
Something nice like you always wanted.
Like a fancy table clock or a repeating rifle.
Why on Earth would I want a rifle?
Bears.
- Here?
- It was in the papers.
Pet shop man lost his out of his front yard in Brooklyn last week.
Attacked a granny and the postman before they took it down.
Thank you for your kindly offer, but I'll be fine.
Me, I'm thinking about getting one of these fancy new automobiles.
Learning to drive it proper.
Only $495.
Hah!
Says in here all you need is an electric plug and a...
What was it?
- Desire.
- Desire for adventure.
Can you picture me piloting one of them around the city?
Imagine all the escaped bears you could find.
I must be going.
Enjoy your daydreaming.
Ah!
Dreaming is for blokes not smart enough to get what they want.
- Have fun at today's big event.
- Cleary.
Please give Mrs. Robertson my deepest appreciations.
We are all blessed to know her this fine day.
Bertie the Wise.
You saw Zinberg?
I did.
- You have information for me?
- I do.
Hold that thought, Dr. Chickering, because I, as of 6:41 this morning, have solved this rotten riddle.
See, I at first thought the answer lay in the blood's coagulability, but Dr. Edwards showed me the error of my thinking.
I then began to hypothesize that the number of red blood cells per cubic millimeter is what differentiates us.
But as we know, that number can fluctuate for multiple reasons.
Sickness, altitude...
And aren't there around six million blood cells per cubic millimeter?
Exactly.
And as I was about 9,000 cells into a count of one of my samples, I found something.
It's not the number, it's the size.
In some cases, there were 75% that were 7.5 microns.
In others, it was only 25%.
I studied sample after sample.
And then a beautiful pattern emerged.
Come, take a look.
Come.
Come.
See, this is the group that was 75% at 7.5 microns.
Look.
Okay, this one is 60%.
Look.
This was 42.
Twenty-five.
And finally, 18%.
Zinberg was wrong.
It's not three types, it's actually five.
Do you see?
Honestly, no.
It's there, damn it.
I know it's a Sunday, but that's no reason to leave your brain in bed.
Come on and wake up.
Wake up.
Look again.
I doubt even the great Zinberg will have reached that conclusion.
Has he?
Your look tells me he has.
No, he has not.
So we have won.
What he's found is remarkable.
And he's open to sharing it.
I think he's quite sincere in his pledge to collaborate, and if you would just be willing to share...
Oh, and let him gain the glory on the backs of our ingenuity?
- I honestly do not think that is his intention.
- No, we will be first!
And we will be first without him!
Were you followed?
Followed?
No.
What do you mean?
He's got, you know, people, spies everywhere.
Maybe you're one of them.
Thack, I am no such thing.
And I think you need rest.
All right, you can go.
Did he enlist you in this?
I volunteered.
Can you still do what I asked?
It's all arranged.
She's perfect.
Her anemic condition was brought about by chlorosis.
They've tried arsenic, bone marrow, hydrotherapy.
Nothing's worked.
Maybe we shouldn't interfere.
The patient is sick enough.
It seems cruel.
She's got nothing else.
Let's give her a chance.
A transfusion of blood may be just what's needed.
Well...
This is certainly your lucky day.
When you wake up, you'll be cured.
Nurse Elkins.
Blood is flowing.
Pulse is rapid.
Pulse is erratic.
Pulse is weakening.
- What's happening?
- It's not working.
I have no pulse.
Fuck.
John.
What have I done?
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Bertie.
Excuse me.
- Bertie.
- Lucy, what's wrong?
It's Dr. Thackery.
Congratulations, mate!
Thackery.
John.
John.
John, it's the drug.
It's destroying you.
John.
You need to stop.
I can't.
- John.
- I can't stop.
We'll find someone who can help you.
Right, Bertie?
So it's all true, then?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Dear God.
- Bertie.
- What?
Please.
I don't know what to do.
You think I know what to do with this madness?
- You have to help him.
- I don't have to do anything!
Please, Bertie.
Whoa.
Mr. Cleary?
- That's me.
- Got something for you.
Thank you.
Sit him up, please.
How much cocaine have you injected today, doctor?
Twelve grams.
That's quite a tolerance.
You've seen people in his condition before?
In my practice, more than a bit these days.
Women of a certain breeding who have become dependent on the drug.
Can you help him?
In the meantime, keep him comfortable.
Your man is no more.
He wasn't my man, Mr. Ping.
He was causing Thackery the trouble, remember?
His request.
And I am sure he'll be grateful you came by to let us know.
I've known Thackery a long time.
He loves my woman, my opium.
He always pays.
But you...
Where did you get that?
From Collier's desk.
A man who owes me $9,000 as long as you owe Collier would be fed to my pigs.
That book is not...
I can read left to right, not just up and down.
This my book now.
I was so close.
What?
What did you just say?
I was so close with that girl.
No, you weren't.
I read Zinberg's papers.
There's nothing to do with the size of the blood cells.
It has to do with the agglutinating antibodies.
Certain people have one type, others another.
You were off by a mile.
Hello.
Dr. Chickering.
I believe Dr. Hackett is expecting us.
Would you empty your pockets, please?
Is there someone you would like to list as the next of kin?
There's nothing you can do for him now.
There's no use in sitting there worrying about him.
Perhaps you could advance us the drugs and we could pay you once we've charged the patients.
Your patients can't pay.
This has always been the Church's issue with the Knick.
Your policies create dependency.
Why would they advance us anything?
Our chief surgeon is gone.
His predecessor killed himself.
And the only man left here with a scalpel is a Negro.
But there is a solution.
Same one we've had all along.
Close the Knick and move uptown.
The decision has to be made now.
Metropolitan Hospital has made an offer for my land uptown.
I can't hold it for us any longer.
In light of all that's happened here,
I think it's time we bring this matter to a vote.
All in favor of shuttering this place and moving the Knick uptown?
Aye.
Then... it's decided.
Welcome to Cromartie Hospital.
I'm Dr. Hackett.
When Dr. Chickering Sr. Called ahead on your behalf, he asked that you be registered under an alias to protect your privacy.
Is there a name that you prefer?
Crutchfield.
Excellent.
Favorite teacher?
My mother.
You have been steered to the right place.
Thank you.
As our reputation has grown, we've begun to specialize in treating cocaine madness.
The withdrawal of the drug from your system will be the hardest part.
Well, from the looks of you, you've done enough damage to yourself already.
We here at Cromartie Hospital believe that the pain of detoxification is counterproductive to restoring your health.
So we have developed a series of treatments designed to ease your suffering.
Including a miraculous medication that can virtually eliminate the misery of withdrawal.
And don't worry.
It's from Bayer, the aspirin company.
Safe as can be.
Rest assured, these treatments will only be for the first month or two.
Time to start getting better.
Ripped By mstoll
Evening.
You?
You know, it would be nice if for just once in my life a lady wasn't disappointed to see me.
Climb in the back.
Hyah!
Is it much further?
We'll be there in no time.
I'd like to know exactly where it is we're going.
I'm not gonna say.
Don't you worry.
It's safe.
None of your fancy society types will be taking an evening stroll anywhere nearby.
But it wouldn't matter.
I've had more than my fair share of your type needing my services.
- Makes sense.
- In what way?
Well, matters of the flesh.
Don't really matter how fancy the table is you're sitting at.
Everyone gets hungry.
With the amount of time you rich ladies spend making yourself pretty, it's no surprise someone wanted to put that to good use.
Men, they want what they want when they want it.
Then you all come to Cleary for the fix.
Hyah.
You promised it wasn't you who'd perform it.
You can relax.
It ain't me.
It's better.
This ain't the place for joking, Cleary.
It ain't no joke, I swear.
She's a paying customer like all the rest.
You're the...
Yes, I'm the one who does it.
You don't want this rhinoceros doing it, do you?
But you're...
And you're a pretty, proper virgin on the cusp of her wedding day.
We're friends, Harry.
You could have told me.
So could you.
But then neither of us could, could we?
This is where you leave, Tom.
Ah!
Could have done without him in the middle of this.
Never wanted him there in the first place.
You don't have to do this.
Yes, I do.
You'll be married soon.
You can tell anyone who can count to nine that it happened on your wedding night.
I'll be your midwife and vouch for the baby coming early.
No, this has to happen here tonight.
I can only find the courage to ask for this just so many times.
At least talk to Phillip about it.
He may see things differently.
I'll get you through it as quick as I can, little daughter.
A tumor has amassed at the base of the skull which is the cause of the patient's terrible pain.
By trephining,
I hope to relieve some of that pressure.
As you can see, my assessment is correct as the brain's fluid is immediately being forced out through the opening.
Syringe.
In order to keep the intracranial pressure at bay, it is my opinion that the hole I've just created should remain open even after the operation.
And now on to the tumor.
Surgical knife.
This is our surgical preparation room.
Good afternoon, Doctors.
Good afternoon, Dr. Zinberg.
Taking a tour of our old gal?
She's been through quite a few battles, but we've managed to keep her afloat.
Isn't that right, Thack?
Dr. Zinberg is making the rounds at all of the city's hospitals.
He's hoping to promote greater cooperation between the surgeons.
Curiously, I found our New York brethren much less willing than my previous ones in Chicago.
Well, I think that's changing, thanks to you.
My father and I recently sat in on the pulmonary abscess procedure you did on your last visit to New York Hospital.
He used what looked like this impossible suture on both layers of the parietal.
It was very, very impressive.
Dr. Zinberg has agreed to perform a surgery for us here at the Knick.
Really?
Who invited him?
Mr. Habershorn from the board.
Seems they've heard wonderful things from Dr. Zinberg's patron,
Mr. Loeb, and wanted us to see for ourselves.
Well, you must remind me to send Mr. Habershorn a note.
Well, you'll be a hard act to follow, Dr. Thackery.
Your choice of leaving the skull open is intriguing.
I've always been a believer in osteoplasty, but this contradicts that.
Well, time will tell if my contradiction is correct.
Well, naturally, there are foreseeable complications.
I'd like to try it out on my next tumor patient.
Modify it.
Perhaps we can share our findings.
If that's all right with you, of course.
No, it's not.
Physicians and other disciplines believe the mind is not a place where sickness can fester, but I assure you it can.
This way, please.
Disorders of the mind must not be treated casually.
Indeed, we must be aggressive if our patients are to improve, hmm?
Of course, Dr. Cotton.
Step in.
I'm grateful for you taking on my wife.
Well, it came at the request of our teacher Dr. Meyer at Johns Hopkins.
There's no man I more admire.
Henry.
Whatever the cost, our families are willing to pay it.
I want the best possible care for Eleanor.
Oh, well, she's receiving it.
Please.
Eleanor, you have a visitor.
Hello, sweetheart.
Eleanor.
Eleanor, it's me, Everett.
- Everett.
- In God's name...
What in the hell happened?
It's all part of the treatment.
- We pulled all of her teeth.
- Why?
My research has shown conclusively that all mental disorders stem from disease and infection polluting the brain.
So, the teeth and gums are havens for bacteria and sepsis.
Thus to cure the patient, we must rid the body of all sites of infection.
But her teeth?
She is a beautiful woman.
Who has gone mad.
Now, you must see this as a kindness.
Her teeth had to go.
I believe in this treatment so strongly that I have removed my own children's teeth as a preventative measure.
So this is common practice?
It is not generally accepted.
My colleagues thus far choose to remain in the Dark Ages, but I'm confident when my results come in, they'll soon adopt my technique.
- Then it's been effective?
- Not as yet.
But we've only begun to attack the sites of infection.
I think her tonsils and adenoids will have to come out.
And if that fails to bring improvement, her colon will have to go as well.
Fuck.
Fuck.
Jesus.
Get off him, Junia.
Fuck.
That's more than I expected from you, Herm.
But what I got in my pocket is less than I expected from you.
You missed a payment again.
I thought after the favor I did you at the hospital...
You don't miss a payment!
I made that clear, you dim fuck.
And then you come to my place and blow money on whores?
I just wanted to see my girl.
She's my girl.
They're all my girls!
And that was my money you spent to plug my girl.
Show him a blue burner, Jimmy.
- No, no, no, no.
- Take 'em away!
Or I'll give you 10 like you won't forget.
Please.
Ah!
Oh, fuck.
Nothing breaks a man like a good cock punch.
Seen it kill a fella once.
Your change purse seems to be holding its own, though, Herm.
But it's swelling.
To the size of a billposter's bucket.
I'm tacking on a grand for being late and doubling your rate for it being a repeated offense.
I'll get some ice.
Stir that gravy, Duchess.
Don't want the sugar in there to candy up.
Yes, ma'am.
Joella, take that turkey out, but don't carve it yet.
That meat needs to rest.
Algie, you come to help your mama?
Oh, I'd only get in the way.
Don't let him fool you, girls.
This boy can cook as good as his mama taught him to.
Glazes a ham better than any of them chefs over in Paris.
Thought I'd come by a little early for the lunch today.
Is Cornelia out of her room yet?
Woke up feeling bad.
Been sitting in the parlor.
Girl has the wedding jitters if you ask me.
I'll check on her.
Always so considerate.
No one can see in.
They can all see in.
Are you... are you all right?
It's done.
Was it terrible?
It was our child.
I wanted to be there with you.
I did.
But I couldn't.
You understand?
I think we made a mistake.
- Yes, our affair was the mistake.
- No.
You were looking for a risk to take and I just happened to be it.
- No, that is not true.
- That is true.
Now we are living with the consequences of that.
And we should be grateful to have escaped with our skin.
Now we have to be realistic.
I don't want to be realistic.
You never have wanted to be realistic.
You will marry Phillip.
He's a good man and the two of you will have many splendid, healthy children together.
And this... all of this mess will barely be a memory.
No.
I don't think I should attend the luncheon today.
Please convey my regrets.
In front of you is a man, age 32, suffering from splenic anemia.
Now this is evident in the slight green coloration of the skin.
This disease is rare, insidious, and up until now prognosis was anything but hopeful.
Unfortunately, gentlemen, it is only too true that the entire subject of blood making and blood breaking is as yet very imperfectly understood.
But I believe the answer lies right in the name of the disease itself... the spleen.
I thought you were at lunch at the Robertsons'.
This seemed more interesting.
Where are the atomizers?
He doesn't use them.
He says they're as modern as dinosaurs.
I am now going to separate the spleen from the splenic artery.
Suction.
More clamps, if you please.
We are through.
The patient still has a long road of convalescing ahead of him.
And we have a long road ahead of us in fully understanding this disease and how our blood behaves.
However, we may not be as far off as we once believed.
My distinguished colleague Dr. Karl Landsteiner of Vienna and I have been working together.
And if our experiments continue to prove successful, we will soon propose to you, gentlemen, that we are not of all the same blood, but, in fact, of three distinct bloods.
The question is why do transfusions fail?
Multiple reasons.
The principle being that the transfused blood begins clotting in the new body, immediately killing the recipient.
And that is where we'll start unlocking the mystery.
I'll need both your bloods.
For what purpose?
For the purpose of beating Zinberg and not allowing him to bask in another triumph.
This is one of the main focuses of his research.
He's already around the track and we are at the starting line.
Look, the man upstaged us at the medical conference.
Our exceptional hernia presentation had to play second fiddle to his gadget.
He then arrives at our theater acting all innocent when it is clear that his only intention is to spy and to steal.
There is a difference between wishing to learn and collaborate and looking to steal another man's work.
Zinberg is a thief!
He's a fake.
He steals other people's work and he passes it off as his own.
And I am not allowing him to do it again.
From now on, this will be my main focus.
Beginning today, Dr. Edwards, you will take the lead in all surgeries while I concentrate on this.
Um, until when?
Until we win one of those new Nobel Prizes.
Dr. Thackery.
Dr. Thackery, you need to take a moment and consider yourself.
You are, if I may say, acting irrationally.
And I...
I think the cause may be more pharmaceutical in nature than you realize.
I did not ask what you think.
I told you what to do.
- Bertie.
- Yes?
Come here.
You much of a bleeder?
- I don't believe so.
- Hold still.
Okay.
Oh!
Ow!
Yes.
I'm gonna need you for a special assignment.
Okay.
You've got to find out everything you can about Zinberg.
What he's doing, how far along he is in his research.
How?
Well, he's a man who believes in sharing.
Test that theory.
I need to speak with you urgently.
In private.
I want you to introduce me to your Chinaman.
Who?
The one they brought in here after you saved his life.
I need you to call in the favor he owes you.
Why?
For what?
I want him to kill Bunky Collier for me.
What are you talking about?
You have to ask him for me.
I have no choice.
What is this?
What have... what have you gotten yourself into?
I owe him.
I owe him nearly $10,000 and it's growing every day.
Every minute that we stand here,
I'm incurring more debt than any man could fairly pay in a lifetime.
And you want me to ask a favor of Ping Wu?
You're talking about bargaining with the devil, Herman.
You know, Wu is not a man to get involved with.
He doesn't believe he can die.
And from the scars on him, he might be telling the truth.
Oh.
- It's lovely.
- Thank you.
Ivory?
Yes, it's carved from the tusk of the elephant Frederick shot on safari last year.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Perfectly exquisite.
And now for something old.
Eunice.
Oh, they're stunning.
They belonged to Hobart's mother,
Phillip's grandmother.
It was Hobart who thought you'd look beautiful in them.
Thank you.
Use them well.
I will.
Everett.
Everett.
What the hell?
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen, stop this right now!
What is going on here?
He attacked me!
- You destroyed my life!
- You destroyed yourself.
Dr. Gallinger, you are suspended from service until you straighten yourself out.
Everett.
Everett.
- For God's sake, man...
- John, you gave up on me.
Edwards was not my hire.
You were my choice.
And if you had to make that choice again, would I still be it?
I didn't think so.
Take some time.
Go home, collect yourself.
Come back a new man who can give Edwards a run for his money.
Go home to what?
You were all I had left.
Now look at you.
Don't you look antiseptic.
Perhaps you can complete your task by sneezing into my patient.
Earlier, you spoke of the coagulation problem in transfusion.
Now it's been accepted into fact that normal blood takes 9.28 minutes to coagulate.
You are conversing with me about your experiments now?
How much more evidence of your absurd behavior do you need?
I am on to something that cannot wait.
So normal blood takes 9.28 minutes to coagulate, but if you administer citric acid, then that time increases.
That could mean that each individual has varying levels of citric acid in their blood which we have yet to discover.
Yes, but the coagulation time also increases with certain diseases.
Tuberculosis or leukemia, for example.
And decreases with others.
How do you explain that, then?
Silk suture, please.
I want blood samples from everyone on the ward.
Not the patients.
The nurses and the orderlies.
I'm glad you contacted me, Dr. Chickering.
Well, my father's been after me about it for a while now.
Well, he only wants a good situation for you.
And I have that with Thackery.
Yet here you sit.
I won't take a pupil from his mentor, despite your father's request that I do so.
Well, he doesn't quite understand.
Dr. Thackery must be a good man and an excellent influence for you to have such loyalty.
I wanted to collaborate with Thackery.
Your brain surgery, our blood work.
Your hernia and previa procedures, our endoscope.
We could have been excellent partners.
I don't think Thackery believed you were being sincere.
I only want to solve problems and help people.
I'm sure Dr. Thackery feels similarly.
Of course.
We're close on the blood types.
We're learning more every day.
Imagine being able to safely transfuse.
The lives saved.
But we're stuck.
The final hurdle is proving harder to negotiate than we imagined.
What's this?
It's what I was going to present to the next society meeting.
It's what we have so far.
Call it a show of good faith.
I'm not concerned with who figures it out as long as it gets solved.
I don't know what to say.
Say you'll help us.
If Thackery agrees to collaborate, put our minds together and find the answer, the documents are his.
If not...
I will trust you to do with them what you think is right.
Why did Thackery not come?
Why did he send you?
Do you mind if we speak alone?
This is not an average request.
Thackery works for me.
And I need to protect him.
And if this goes wrong, it can't lead back to him.
That's why I'm here instead.
What does he want?
To have you make good on your debt to him for saving your life.
He owes a great deal of money to Bunky Collier.
Collier's threatened Thack's life.
Abused him terribly.
He's beaten him, humiliated him, and dealt with him unfairly.
He wants Collier dead.
He said that?
His words?
Are you sure that's what he wants?
Very.
Let me take you home.
We can sleep and see how it looks to you in the morning.
He's too far ahead.
He could be getting ready to publish next week.
Would you fetch me some of my medicine, please?
What?
I don't like what it's doing to you.
I don't care what you like.
I need to work.
I need to concentrate.
So, please, just do as you're told.
- John...
- Now, Nurse Elkins.
You see what it's doing to him?
I do.
Then leave it here.
- Let him go without it.
- I can't.
You haven't seen the alternative.
I have.
It's much worse.
Excuse me.
Neely, I told him.
I told Phillip if he presented San Francisco as a fait accompli, you would feel the way you're feeling now.
- What are you going to do?
- What do you mean?
Are you getting married tomorrow?
- I have to.
- Neely, don't.
You're a Robertson.
There are ways.
Can we talk about you, please?
How are you?
How's San Francisco?
I don't know if you've noticed, but Dad isn't... isn't Dad anymore.
He's not... not the same.
Has something happened between you two?
No.
No, I'm talking about the business.
When I arrived in San Francisco, things were a mess.
I spent most of the last year trying to renegotiate some of the deals he made.
They would have proved fatal to the company if I hadn't.
If that's true, it makes me sad.
Me, too.
Oh, good morning, miss.
I didn't expect to find you awake.
Couldn't sleep.
It is a big day.
Yes.
After you, sir.
Everything you could ever want.
- Morning, Harry.
- Thomas.
Lot of good stuff in these Sears catalogues.
Pianos, headstones, ovens.
- You looking for anything?
- What do you mean?
Something for yourself.
Something nice like you always wanted.
Like a fancy table clock or a repeating rifle.
Why on earth would I want a rifle?
Bears.
- Here?
- It was in the papers.
Pet shop man lost his out of his front yard in Brooklyn last week.
Attacked a granny and the postman before they took it down.
Thank you for your kindly offer, but I'll be fine.
Me, I'm thinking about getting one of these fancy new automobiles.
Learning to drive it proper.
Only $495.
Says in here all you need is an electric plug and a... what was it?
- Desire.
- Desire for adventure.
Can you picture me piloting one of them around the city?
Imagine all the escaped bears you could find.
I must be going.
Enjoy your daydreaming.
Ah, dreaming is for blokes not smart enough to get what they want.
- Have fun at today's big event.
- Cleary.
Pouncey.
Please give Mrs. Robertson my deepest appreciations.
We are all blessed to know her this fine day.
Bertie the Wise.
You saw Zinberg?
I did.
- You have information for me?
- I do.
Hold that thought, Dr. Chickering, because I, as of 6:41 this morning, have solved this rotten riddle.
See, I at first thought the answer lay in the blood's coagulability, but Dr. Edwards showed me the error of my thinking.
I then began to hypothesize that the number of red blood cells per cubic millimeter is what differentiates us.
But as we know, that number can fluctuate for multiple reasons... sickness, altitude...
And aren't there around six million blood cells per cubic millimeter?
Exactly.
And as I was about 9,000 cells into a count of one of my samples, I found something.
It's not the number, it's the size.
In some cases, there were 75% that were 7.5 microns.
In others, it was only 25%.
I studied sample after sample.
And then a beautiful pattern emerged.
Come, take a look.
Come.
Come.
See, this is the group that was 75% at 7.5 microns.
Look.
Okay, this one is 60%.
Look.
This was 42.
25.
And finally, 18%.
Zinberg was wrong.
It's not three types, it's actually five.
Do you see?
Honestly, no.
It's there, damn it.
I know it's a Sunday, but that's no reason to leave your brain in bed.
Come on and wake up.
Wake up.
Look again.
I doubt even the great Zinberg will have reached that conclusion.
Has he?
Your look tells me he has.
No, he has not.
So we have won.
What he's found is remarkable.
And he's open to sharing it.
I think he's quite sincere in his pledge to collaborate, and if you would just be willing to share...
Oh, and let him gain the glory on the backs of our ingenuity?
I honestly do not...
- think that is his intention.
- No, we will be first!
And we will be first without him!
Were you followed?
Followed?
No.
What do you mean?
He's got, you know, people, spies everywhere.
Maybe you're one of them.
Thack, I am no such thing.
And I think you need rest.
All right, you can go.
Did he enlist you in this?
I volunteered.
Can you still do what I asked?
It's all arranged.
She's perfect.
Her anemic condition was brought about by chlorosis.
They've tried arsenic, bone marrow, hydrotherapy... nothing's worked.
Maybe we shouldn't interfere.
The patient is sick enough.
It seems cruel.
She's got nothing else.
Let's give her a chance.
A transfusion of blood may be just what's needed.
Well... this is certainly your lucky day.
When you wake up, you'll be cured.
Nurse Elkins.
Blood is flowing.
Pulse is rapid.
Pulse is erratic.
Pulse is weakening.
- What's happening?
- It's not working.
I have no pulse.
Fuck.
John.
What have I done?
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Bertie.
Excuse me.
- Bertie.
- Lucy, what's wrong?
It's Dr. Thackery.
Congratulations!
Thackery.
John.
John.
John, it's the drug.
It's destroying you.
John.
You need to stop.
I can't.
- John.
- I can't stop.
We'll find someone who can help you.
Right, Bertie?
So it's all true, then?
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Dear God.
- Bertie.
- What?
Please.
I don't know what to do.
You think I know what to do with this madness?
- You have to help him.
- I don't have to do anything!
Please, Bertie.
Whoa.
Mr. Cleary?
- That's me.
- Got something for you.
Thank you.
Hee.
Hup.
Sit him up, please.
How much cocaine have you injected today, Doctor?
12 grams.
That's quite a tolerance.
You've seen people in his condition before?
In my practice, more than a bit these days.
Women of a certain breeding who have become dependent on the drug.
Can you help him?
In the meantime, keep him comfortable.
Your man is no more.
He wasn't my man, Mr. Ping.
He was causing Thackery the trouble, remember?
His request.
And I am sure he'll be grateful you came by to let us know.
I've known Thackery a long time.
He loves my woman, my opium.
He always pays.
But you...
Where did you get that?
From Collier's desk.
A man who owes me 9,000 as long as you owe Collier would be fed to my pigs.
That book is not...
I can read left to right, not just up and down.
This my book now.
I was so close.
What?
What did you just say?
I was so close with that girl.
No, you weren't.
I read Zinberg's papers.
There's nothing to do with the size of the blood cells.
It has to do with the agglutinating antibodies.
Certain people have one type, others another.
You were off by a mile.
Hello.
Dr. Chickering.
I believe Dr. Hackett is expecting us.
Would you empty your pockets, please?
Is there someone you would like to list as the next of kin?
There's nothing you can do for him now.
There's no use in sitting there worrying about him.
Perhaps you could advance us the drugs and we could pay you once we've charged the patients.
Your patients can't pay.
This has always been the Church's issue with the Knick.
Your policies create dependency.
Why would they advance us anything?
Our chief surgeon is gone.
His predecessor killed himself.
And the only man left here with a scalpel is a Negro.
But there is a solution.
Same one we've had all along.
Close the Knick and move uptown.
The decision has to be made now.
Metropolitan Hospital has made an offer for my land uptown.
I can't hold it for us any longer.
In light of all that's happened here...
I think it's time we bring this matter to a vote.
All in favor of shuttering this place and moving the Knick uptown?
Aye.
Then it's decided.
Welcome to Cromartie Hospital.
I'm Dr. Hackett.
When Dr. Chickering Sr. called ahead on your behalf, he asked that you be registered under an alias to protect your privacy.
Is there a name that you prefer?
Crutchfield.
Excellent.
- Favorite teacher?
- My mother.
You have been steered to the right place.
Thank you.
As our reputation has grown, we've begun to specialize in treating cocaine madness.
The withdrawal of the drug from your system will be the hardest part.
From the looks of you, you've done enough damage to yourself already.
We here at Cromartie Hospital believe that the pain of detoxification is counterproductive to restoring your health.
So we have developed a series of treatments designed to ease your suffering, including a miraculous medication that can virtually eliminate the misery of withdrawal.
Don't worry.
It's from Bayer the aspirin company.
Safe as can be.
Rest assured, these treatments will only be for the first month or two.
Time to start getting better.
(horse trotting)
(carriage approaching)
(carriage stops)
Cleary:
Evening.
You?
You know, it would be nice if for just once in my life a lady wasn't disappointed to see me.
Climb in the back.
(Cleary coughs) Hyah!
(chuckles)
Is it much further?
We'll be there in no time.
I'd like to know exactly where it is we're going.
I'm not gonna say.
Don't you worry.
It's safe.
None of your fancy society types will be taking an evening stroll anywhere nearby.
But it wouldn't matter.
I've had more than my fair share of your type needing my services.
(laughs)
- Makes sense.
- In what way?
Well, matters of the flesh.
Don't really matter how fancy the table is you're sitting at.
Everyone gets hungry.
With the amount of time you rich ladies spend making yourself pretty, it's no surprise someone wanted to put that to good use.
Men, they want what they want when they want it.
Then you all come to Cleary for the fix.
(clicks tongue) Hyah.
(clears throat)
You promised it wasn't you who'd perform it.
You can relax.
It ain't me.
(chuckles)
It's better.
(laughs)
This ain't the place for joking, Cleary.
It ain't no joke, I swear.
She's a paying customer like all the rest.
You're the...
Yes, I'm the one who does it.
You don't want this rhinoceros doing it, do you?
But you're...
And you're a pretty, proper virgin on the cusp of her wedding day.
We're friends, Harry.
You could have told me.
So could you.
But then neither of us could, could we?
This is where you leave, Tom.
Ah!
(door opens)
Could have done without him in the middle of this.
Never wanted him there in the first place.
You don't have to do this.
Yes, I do.
You'll be married soon.
You can tell anyone who can count to nine that it happened on your wedding night.
I'll be your midwife and vouch for the baby coming early.
No, this has to happen here tonight.
I can only find the courage to ask for this just so many times.
At least talk to Phillip about it.
He may see things differently.
I'll get you through it as quick as I can, little daughter.
A tumor has amassed at the base of the skull which is the cause of the patient's terrible pain.
By trephining,
I hope to relieve some of that pressure.
(clock ticking)
As you can see, my assessment is correct as the brain's fluid is immediately being forced out through the opening.
Syringe.
In order to keep the intracranial pressure at bay, it is my opinion that the hole I've just created should remain open even after the operation.
And now on to the tumor.
Surgical knife.
This is our surgical preparation room.
Good afternoon, Doctors.
Good afternoon, Dr. Zinberg.
Taking a tour of our old gal?
She's been through quite a few battles, but we've managed to keep her afloat.
Isn't that right, Thack?
Dr. Zinberg is making the rounds at all of the city's hospitals.
He's hoping to promote greater cooperation between the surgeons.
Curiously, I found our New York brethren much less willing than my previous ones in Chicago.
Well, I think that's changing, thanks to you.
My father and I recently sat in on the pulmonary abscess procedure you did on your last visit to New York Hospital.
He used what looked like this impossible suture on both layers of the parietal.
It was very, very impressive.
Dr. Zinberg has agreed to perform a surgery for us here at the Knick.
Really?
Who invited him?
Barrow:
Mr. Habershorn from the board.
Seems they've heard wonderful things from Dr. Zinberg's patron,
Mr. Loeb, and wanted us to see for ourselves.
Well, you must remind me to send Mr. Habershorn a note.
Zinberg:
Well, you'll be a hard act to follow, Dr. Thackery.
Your choice of leaving the skull open is intriguing.
I've always been a believer in osteoplasty, but this contradicts that.
Well, time will tell if my contradiction is correct.
Well, naturally, there are foreseeable complications.
I'd like to try it out on my next tumor patient.
Modify it.
Perhaps we can share our findings.
If that's all right with you, of course.
No, it's not.
Physicians and other disciplines believe the mind is not a place where sickness can fester, but I assure you it can.
This way, please.
Disorders of the mind must not be treated casually.
Indeed, we must be aggressive if our patients are to improve, hmm?
Of course, Dr. Cotton.
Step in.
I'm grateful for you taking on my wife.
Well, it came at the request of our teacher Dr. Meyer at Johns Hopkins.
There's no man I more admire.
Henry.
Whatever the cost, our families are willing to pay it.
I want the best possible care for Eleanor.
Oh, well, she's receiving it.
Please.
Eleanor, you have a visitor.
Hello, sweetheart.
Eleanor.
Eleanor, it's me, Everett.
- Everett.
- In God's name...
What in the hell happened?
It's all part of the treatment.
- We pulled all of her teeth.
- Why?
My research has shown conclusively that all mental disorders stem from disease and infection polluting the brain.
So, the teeth and gums are havens for bacteria and sepsis.
Thus to cure the patient, we must rid the body of all sites of infection.
But her teeth?
She is a beautiful woman.
Who has gone mad.
Now, you must see this as a kindness.
Her teeth had to go.
I believe in this treatment so strongly that I have removed my own children's teeth as a preventative measure.
So this is common practice?
It is not generally accepted.
My colleagues thus far choose to remain in the Dark Ages, but I'm confident when my results come in, they'll soon adopt my technique.
- Then it's been effective?
- Not as yet.
But we've only begun to attack the sites of infection.
I think her tonsils and adenoids will have to come out.
And if that fails to bring improvement, her colon will have to go as well.
(whimpers)
- Fuck.
Fuck.
- (moaning)
Jesus.
Get off him, Junia.
Barrow:
Fuck.
That's more than I expected from you, Herm.
But what I got in my pocket is less than I expected from you.
You missed a payment again.
I thought after the favor I did you at the hospital...
- You don't miss a payment!
- (groaning)
I made that clear, you dim fuck.
And then you come to my place and blow money on whores?
I just wanted to see my girl.
She's my girl.
They're all my girls!
And that was my money you spent to plug my girl.
Show him a blue burner, Jimmy.
- No, no, no, no.
- Take 'em away!
Or I'll give you 10 like you won't forget.
Please.
Ah!
- (Jimmy laughing) - (Barrow gasping) Oh, fuck.
Nothing breaks a man like a good cock punch.
(Jimmy laughing)
Seen it kill a fella once.
Your change purse seems to be holding its own, though, Herm.
But it's swelling.
To the size of a billposter's bucket.
(men laughing)
I'm tacking on a grand for being late and doubling your rate for it being a repeated offense.
I'll get some ice.
(breathing heavily)
Stir that gravy, Duchess.
Don't want the sugar in there to candy up.
Yes, ma'am.
Joella, take that turkey out, but don't carve it yet.
That meat needs to rest.
Algie, you come to help your mama?
Oh, I'd only get in the way.
Don't let him fool you, girls.
This boy can cook as good as his mama taught him to.
Glazes a ham better than any of them chefs over in Paris.
Thought I'd come by a little early for the lunch today.
Is Cornelia out of her room yet?
Woke up feeling bad.
Been sitting in the parlor.
Girl has the wedding jitters if you ask me.
I'll check on her.
Always so considerate.
No one can see in.
They can all see in.
Are you... are you all right?
It's done.
Was it terrible?
It was our child.
I wanted to be there with you.
I did.
But I couldn't.
You understand?
I think we made a mistake.
- Yes, our affair was the mistake.
- No.
You were looking for a risk to take and I just happened to be it.
- No, that is not true.
- That is true.
Now we are living with the consequences of that.
And we should be grateful to have escaped with our skin.
Now we have to be realistic.
I don't want to be realistic.
You never have wanted to be realistic.
(sighs)
You will marry Phillip.
He's a good man and the two of you will have many splendid, healthy children together.
And this... all of this mess will barely be a memory.
No.
I don't think I should attend the luncheon today.
Please convey my regrets.
Zinberg:
In front of you is a man, age 32, suffering from splenic anemia.
Now this is evident in the slight green coloration of the skin.
(clock ticking)
This disease is rare, insidious, and up until now prognosis was anything but hopeful.
Unfortunately, gentlemen, it is only too true that the entire subject of blood making and blood breaking is as yet very imperfectly understood.
But I believe the answer lies right in the name of the disease itself... the spleen.
I thought you were at lunch at the Robertsons'.
This seemed more interesting.
Where are the atomizers?
He doesn't use them.
He says they're as modern as dinosaurs.
I am now going to separate the spleen from the splenic artery.
Suction.
More clamps, if you please.
(blood slurping)
We are through.
The patient still has a long road of convalescing ahead of him.
And we have a long road ahead of us in fully understanding this disease and how our blood behaves.
However, we may not be as far off as we once believed.
My distinguished colleague Dr. Karl Landsteiner of Vienna and I have been working together.
And if our experiments continue to prove successful, we will soon propose to you, gentlemen, that we are not of all the same blood, but, in fact, of three distinct bloods.
(men murmuring)
The question is why do transfusions fail?
Multiple reasons.
The principle being that the transfused blood begins clotting in the new body, immediately killing the recipient.
And that is where we'll start unlocking the mystery.
I'll need both your bloods.
For what purpose?
For the purpose of beating Zinberg and not allowing him to bask in another triumph.
Edwards:
This is one of the main focuses of his research.
He's already around the track and we are at the starting line.
Look, the man upstaged us at the medical conference.
Our exceptional hernia presentation had to play second fiddle to his gadget.
He then arrives at our theater acting all innocent when it is clear that his only intention is to spy and to steal.
There is a difference between wishing to learn and collaborate and looking to steal another man's work.
Zinberg is a thief!
He's a fake.
He steals other people's work and he passes it off as his own.
And I am not allowing him to do it again.
From now on, this will be my main focus.
Beginning today, Dr. Edwards, you will take the lead in all surgeries while I concentrate on this.
Um, until when?
Until we win one of those new Nobel Prizes.
Dr. Thackery.
Dr. Thackery, you need to take a moment and consider yourself.
You are, if I may say, acting irrationally.
And I...
I think the cause may be more pharmaceutical in nature than you realize.
I did not ask what you think.
I told you what to do.
- Bertie.
- Yes?
Come here.
You much of a bleeder?
- I don't believe so.
- Hold still.
Okay.
Oh!
Ow!
Yes.
I'm gonna need you for a special assignment.
Okay.
You've got to find out everything you can about Zinberg.
What he's doing, how far along he is in his research.
How?
Well, he's a man who believes in sharing.
Test that theory.
(door opens)
(clears throat)
I need to speak with you urgently.
In private.
I want you to introduce me to your Chinaman.
Who?
The one they brought in here after you saved his life.
I need you to call in the favor he owes you.
Why?
For what?
I want him to kill Bunky Collier for me.
(laughing)
What are you talking about?
You have to ask him for me.
I have no choice.
What is this?
What have... what have you gotten yourself into?
I owe him.
I owe him nearly $10,000 and it's growing every day.
Every minute that we stand here,
I'm incurring more debt than any man could fairly pay in a lifetime.
(sniffles)
And you want me to ask a favor of Ping Wu?
You're talking about bargaining with the devil, Herman.
You know, Wu is not a man to get involved with.
He doesn't believe he can die.
And from the scars on him, he might be telling the truth.
Oh.
- It's lovely.
- Thank you.
Ivory?
Yes, it's carved from the tusk of the elephant Frederick shot on safari last year.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Perfectly exquisite.
And now for something old.
Eunice.
Oh, they're stunning.
They belonged to Hobart's mother,
Phillip's grandmother.
It was Hobart who thought you'd look beautiful in them.
Thank you.
Use them well.
I will.
Everett.
Everett.
- (nurses screaming) - (Gallinger grunting)
What the hell?
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen, stop this right now!
What is going on here?
He attacked me!
- You destroyed my life!
- You destroyed yourself.
Dr. Gallinger, you are suspended from service until you straighten yourself out.
Everett.
Everett.
- For God's sake, man...
- John, you gave up on me.
Edwards was not my hire.
You were my choice.
And if you had to make that choice again, would I still be it?
I didn't think so.
Take some time.
Go home, collect yourself.
Come back a new man who can give Edwards a run for his money.
Go home to what?
You were all I had left.
Now look at you.
Don't you look antiseptic.
Perhaps you can complete your task by sneezing into my patient.
Earlier, you spoke of the coagulation problem in transfusion.
Now it's been accepted into fact that normal blood takes 9.28 minutes to coagulate.
You are conversing with me about your experiments now?
How much more evidence of your absurd behavior do you need?
- I am on to something that cannot wait.
- (scoffs)
So normal blood takes 9.28 minutes to coagulate, but if you administer citric acid, then that time increases.
That could mean that each individual has varying levels of citric acid in their blood which we have yet to discover.
Yes, but the coagulation time also increases with certain diseases.
Tuberculosis or leukemia, for example.
And decreases with others.
How do you explain that, then?
Silk suture, please.
(man coughing)
I want blood samples from everyone on the ward.
Not the patients.
The nurses and the orderlies.
I'm glad you contacted me, Dr. Chickering.
Well, my father's been after me about it for a while now.
Well, he only wants a good situation for you.
And I have that with Thackery.
Yet here you sit.
(chuckles)
I won't take a pupil from his mentor, despite your father's request that I do so.
Well, he doesn't quite understand.
Dr. Thackery must be a good man and an excellent influence for you to have such loyalty.
I wanted to collaborate with Thackery.
Your brain surgery, our blood work.
Your hernia and previa procedures, our endoscope.
We could have been excellent partners.
I don't think Thackery believed you were being sincere.
I only want to solve problems and help people.
I'm sure Dr. Thackery feels similarly.
Of course.
We're close on the blood types.
We're learning more every day.
Imagine being able to safely transfuse.
The lives saved.
But we're stuck.
The final hurdle is proving harder to negotiate than we imagined.
What's this?
It's what I was going to present to the next society meeting.
It's what we have so far.
Call it a show of good faith.
I'm not concerned with who figures it out as long as it gets solved.
I don't know what to say.
Say you'll help us.
If Thackery agrees to collaborate, put our minds together and find the answer, the documents are his.
If not...
I will trust you to do with them what you think is right.
Wu:
Why did Thackery not come?
Why did he send you?
Do you mind if we speak alone?
(speaks Cantonese)
This is not an average request.
Thackery works for me.
And I need to protect him.
And if this goes wrong, it can't lead back to him.
That's why I'm here instead.
What does he want?
To have you make good on your debt to him for saving your life.
He owes a great deal of money to Bunky Collier.
Collier's threatened Thack's life.
Abused him terribly.
He's beaten him, humiliated him, and dealt with him unfairly.
He wants Collier dead.
He said that?
His words?
Are you sure that's what he wants?
Very.
Let me take you home.
We can sleep and see how it looks to you in the morning.
He's too far ahead.
He could be getting ready to publish next week.
Would you fetch me some of my medicine, please?
What?
I don't like what it's doing to you.
I don't care what you like.
I need to work.
I need to concentrate.
So, please, just do as you're told.
- John...
- Now, Nurse Elkins.
You see what it's doing to him?
I do.
Then leave it here.
- Let him go without it.
- I can't.
You haven't seen the alternative.
I have.
It's much worse.
Excuse me.
(inaudible dialogue)
Neely, I told him.
I told Phillip if he presented San Francisco as a fait accompli, you would feel the way you're feeling now.
- What are you going to do?
- What do you mean?
Are you getting married tomorrow?
- I have to.
- Neely, don't.
You're a Robertson.
There are ways.
Can we talk about you, please?
How are you?
How's San Francisco?
I don't know if you've noticed, but Dad isn't... isn't Dad anymore.
He's not... not the same.
Has something happened between you two?
No.
No, I'm talking about the business.
When I arrived in San Francisco, things were a mess.
I spent most of the last year trying to renegotiate some of the deals he made.
They would have proved fatal to the company if I hadn't.
If that's true, it makes me sad.
Me, too.
Oh, good morning, miss.
I didn't expect to find you awake.
Couldn't sleep.
It is a big day.
Yes.
After you, sir.
Everything you could ever want.
- Morning, Harry.
- Thomas.
Lot of good stuff in these Sears catalogues.
Pianos, headstones, ovens.
- You looking for anything?
- What do you mean?
Something for yourself.
Something nice like you always wanted.
Like a fancy table clock or a repeating rifle.
Why on earth would I want a rifle?
Bears.
- Here?
- It was in the papers.
Pet shop man lost his out of his front yard in Brooklyn last week.
Attacked a granny and the postman before they took it down.
Thank you for your kindly offer, but I'll be fine.
Me, I'm thinking about getting one of these fancy new automobiles.
Learning to drive it proper.
Only $495.
Says in here all you need is an electric plug and a... what was it?
- Desire.
- Desire for adventure.
(laughs)
Can you picture me piloting one of them around the city?
Imagine all the escaped bears you could find.
I must be going.
Enjoy your daydreaming.
Ah, dreaming is for blokes not smart enough to get what they want.
- Have fun at today's big event.
- Cleary.
Pouncey.
Please give Mrs. Robertson my deepest appreciations.
We are all blessed to know her this fine day.
Bertie the Wise.
You saw Zinberg?
I did.
- You have information for me?
- I do.
Hold that thought, Dr. Chickering, because I, as of 6:41 this morning, have solved this rotten riddle.
See, I at first thought the answer lay in the blood's coagulability, but Dr. Edwards showed me the error of my thinking.
I then began to hypothesize that the number of red blood cells per cubic millimeter is what differentiates us.
But as we know, that number can fluctuate for multiple reasons... sickness, altitude...
And aren't there around six million blood cells per cubic millimeter?
Exactly.
And as I was about 9,000 cells into a count of one of my samples, I found something.
It's not the number, it's the size.
In some cases, there were 75% that were 7.5 microns.
In others, it was only 25%.
I studied sample after sample.
And then a beautiful pattern emerged.
Come, take a look.
Come.
Come.
See, this is the group that was 75% at 7.5 microns.
Look.
Okay, this one is 60%.
Look.
This was 42.
25.
And finally, 18%.
Zinberg was wrong.
It's not three types, it's actually five.
Do you see?
Honestly, no.
It's there, damn it.
I know it's a Sunday, but that's no reason to leave your brain in bed.
Come on and wake up.
Wake up.
Look again.
I doubt even the great Zinberg will have reached that conclusion.
Has he?
Your look tells me he has.
No, he has not.
So we have won.
What he's found is remarkable.
And he's open to sharing it.
I think he's quite sincere in his pledge to collaborate, and if you would just be willing to share...
Oh, and let him gain the glory on the backs of our ingenuity?
I honestly do not...
- think that is his intention.
- No, we will be first!
And we will be first without him!
Were you followed?
Followed?
No.
What do you mean?
He's got, you know, people, spies everywhere.
Maybe you're one of them.
Thack, I am no such thing.
And I think you need rest.
All right, you can go.
Did he enlist you in this?
I volunteered.
Can you still do what I asked?
It's all arranged.
- (chatter) - (woman coughing)
She's perfect.
Her anemic condition was brought about by chlorosis.
They've tried arsenic, bone marrow, hydrotherapy... nothing's worked.
Maybe we shouldn't interfere.
The patient is sick enough.
It seems cruel.
She's got nothing else.
Let's give her a chance.
A transfusion of blood may be just what's needed.
(clock ticking)
Well... this is certainly your lucky day.
When you wake up, you'll be cured.
Nurse Elkins.
Blood is flowing.
Pulse is rapid.
Pulse is erratic.
Pulse is weakening.
- Lucy:
What's happening?
- Thackery:
It's not working.
I have no pulse.
Fuck.
John.
What have I done?
(people chatting, laughing)
(coins clatter)
(chatter stops)
(choir singing)
- (people chatting) - (bell tolling)
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Bertie.
Excuse me.
- Bertie.
- Lucy, what's wrong?
- It's Dr. Thackery.
- (crowd cheering)
Congratulations!
(mumbling)
Thackery.
John.
John.
John, it's the drug.
It's destroying you.
(mumbling)
John.
You need to stop.
I can't.
- John.
- I can't stop.
We'll find someone who can help you.
Right, Bertie?
So it's all true, then?
(crying) I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Dear God.
- Bertie.
- What?
Please.
I don't know what to do.
You think I know what to do with this madness?
- You have to help him.
- I don't have to do anything!
Please, Bertie.
Whoa.
Mr. Cleary?
- That's me.
- Got something for you.
Thank you.
- (kissing) Hee.
Hup.
- (chuckles)
(laughs)
(footsteps)
Sit him up, please.
How much cocaine have you injected today, Doctor?
12 grams.
That's quite a tolerance.
You've seen people in his condition before?
In my practice, more than a bit these days.
Women of a certain breeding who have become dependent on the drug.
Can you help him?
In the meantime, keep him comfortable.
(groans)
Your man is no more.
He wasn't my man, Mr. Ping.
He was causing Thackery the trouble, remember?
His request.
And I am sure he'll be grateful you came by to let us know.
(chuckles)
I've known Thackery a long time.
He loves my woman, my opium.
He always pays.
But you...
Where did you get that?
From Collier's desk.
A man who owes me 9,000 as long as you owe Collier would be fed to my pigs.
That book is not...
I can read left to right, not just up and down.
This my book now.
I was so close.
What?
What did you just say?
I was so close with that girl.
No, you weren't.
I read Zinberg's papers.
There's nothing to do with the size of the blood cells.
It has to do with the agglutinating antibodies.
Certain people have one type, others another.
You were off by a mile.
Hello.
Dr. Chickering.
I believe Dr. Hackett is expecting us.
Would you empty your pockets, please?
Is there someone you would like to list as the next of kin?
Bertie:
There's nothing you can do for him now.
There's no use in sitting there worrying about him.
Perhaps you could advance us the drugs and we could pay you once we've charged the patients.
Your patients can't pay.
This has always been the Church's issue with the Knick.
Your policies create dependency.
Why would they advance us anything?
Our chief surgeon is gone.
His predecessor killed himself.
And the only man left here with a scalpel is a Negro.
But there is a solution.
Same one we've had all along.
Close the Knick and move uptown.
The decision has to be made now.
Metropolitan Hospital has made an offer for my land uptown.
I can't hold it for us any longer.
In light of all that's happened here...
I think it's time we bring this matter to a vote.
All in favor of shuttering this place and moving the Knick uptown?
All:
Aye.
Then it's decided.
Welcome to Cromartie Hospital.
I'm Dr. Hackett.
When Dr. Chickering Sr. called ahead on your behalf, he asked that you be registered under an alias to protect your privacy.
Is there a name that you prefer?
Crutchfield.
Excellent.
- Favorite teacher?
- My mother.
You have been steered to the right place.
Thank you.
As our reputation has grown, we've begun to specialize in treating cocaine madness.
The withdrawal of the drug from your system will be the hardest part.
From the looks of you, you've done enough damage to yourself already.
We here at Cromartie Hospital believe that the pain of detoxification is counterproductive to restoring your health.
So we have developed a series of treatments designed to ease your suffering, including a miraculous medication that can virtually eliminate the misery of withdrawal.
Don't worry.
It's from Bayer the aspirin company.
Safe as can be.
Rest assured, these treatments will only be for the first month or two.
Time to start getting better.
(sighs)
(music playing)
(CARRIAGE APPROACHING)
Ripped By mstoll
(CARRIAGE HALTS)
Evening.
You?
You know, it would be nice if for just once in my life a lady wasn't disappointed to see me.
Climb in the back.
(CLEARY COUGHS)
(URGING HORSE)
(CHUCKLES)
Is it much further?
We'll be there in no time.
I'd like to know exactly where it is we're going.
I'm not gonna say.
Don't you worry.
It's safe.
None of your fancy society types will be taking an evening stroll anywhere nearby.
But it wouldn't matter.
I've had more than my fair share of your type needing my services. (LAUGHS)
Makes sense.
CORNELIA:
In What way?
Well, matters of the flesh.
Don't really matter how fancy the table is you're sitting at, everyone gets hungry.
With the amount of time you rich ladies spend making yourself pretty, it's no surprise someone wanted to put that to good use.
Men, they want what they want when they want it.
Then you all come to Cleary for the fix.
(CLICKS TONGUE)
(URGING HORSE)
(CLEARS THROAT)
You promised it wasn't you who'd perform it.
You can relax.
It ain't me.
(CHUCKLES)
It's better.
(CLEARY LAUGHING)
SISTER:
This ain't the place for joking, Cleary.
It ain't no joke, I swear.
She's a paying customer like all the rest.
You're the...
Yes, I'm the one who does it.
You don't want this rhinoceros doing it, do you?
But you're...
And you're a pretty, proper virgin on the cusp of her wedding day.
We're friends, Harry.
You could have told me.
So could you.
But then neither of us could, could we?
This is where you leave, Tom.
CLEARY:
Ah!
(DOOR OPENS)
(DOOR CLOSES)
Could have done without him in the middle of this.
Never wanted him there in the first place.
You don't have to do this.
Yes, I do.
You'll be married soon.
You can tell anyone who can count to nine that it happened on your wedding night.
I'll be your midwife and vouch for the baby coming early.
No, this has to happen here tonight.
I can only find the courage to ask for this just so many times.
At least talk to Phillip about it.
He may see things differently.
I'll get you through it as quick as I can, little daughter.
THACKERY:
A tumor has amassed at the base of the skull which is the cause of the patient's terrible pain.
By trepanning,
I hope to relieve some of that pressure.
(CLOCK TICKING)
As you can see, my assessment is correct.
As the brain's fluid is immediately being forced out through the opening.
Syringe.
In order to keep the intracranial pressure at bay, it is my opinion that the hole I've just created should remain open
even after the operation.
And now on to the tumor.
Surgical knife.
This is our surgical preparation room.
Good afternoon, doctors.
Good afternoon, Dr. Zinberg.
Taking a tour of our old gal?
She's been through quite a few battles, but we've managed to keep her afloat.
Isn't that right, Thack?
Dr. Zinberg is making the rounds at all of the city's hospitals.
He's hoping to promote greater cooperation between the surgeons.
Curiously, I found our New York brethren much less willing than my previous ones in Chicago.
Well, I think that's changing, thanks to you.
My father and I recently sat in on the pulmonary abscess procedure you did on your last visit to New York Hospital.
He used what looked like this impossible suture of both layers of the parietal.
It was very, very impressive.
Dr. Zinberg has agreed to perform a surgery for us here at the Knick.
Really?
Who invited him?
HERMAN:
Mr. Habershorn from the board.
Seems they've heard wonderful things from Dr. Zinberg's patron, Mr. Loeb, and wanted us to see for ourselves.
Well, you must remind me to send Mr. Habershorn a note.
ZINBERG:
Well, you'll be a hard act to follow, Dr. Thackery.
Your choice of leaving the skull open is... intriguing.
I've always been a believer in osteoplasty, but this contradicts that.
Well, time will tell if my contradiction is correct.
Well, naturally, there are foreseeable complications.
I'd like to try it out on my next tumor patient.
Modify it.
Perhaps we can share our findings.
If that's all right with you, of course.
No, it's not.
Physicians and other disciplines believe the mind is not a place where sickness can fester, but I assure you it can.
This way, please.
Disorders of the mind must not be treated casually.
Indeed, we must be aggressive if our patients are to improve.
Of course, Dr. Cotton.
Step in.
I'm grateful for you taking on my wife.
Well, it came at the request of our teacher Dr. Meyer at Johns Hopkins.
There's no man I more admire.
- Henry.
- Huh?
Whatever the cost, our families are willing to pay it.
I want the best possible care for Eleanor.
Oh.
Well, she's receiving it.
Please.
Eleanor, you have a visitor.
Hello, sweetheart.
Eleanor.
Eleanor, it's me, Everett.
- Everett.
- In God's name...
What in the hell happened?
It's all part of the treatment.
- We pulled all of her teeth.
- Why?
My research has shown conclusively that all mental disorders stem from disease and infection polluting the brain.
So, the teeth and gums are havens for bacteria and sepsis.
Thus, to cure the patient, we must rid the body of all sites of infection.
GALLINGER:
But her teeth?
She is a beautiful woman.
HENRY:
Who has gone mad.
Now, you must see this as a kindness.
Her teeth had to go.
I believe in this treatment so strongly that I have removed my own children's teeth as a preventative measure.
GALLINGER:
So this is common practice?
HENRY:
It is not generally accepted.
My colleagues thus far choose to remain in the Dark Ages, but I'm confident when my results come in, they'll soon adopt my technique.
GALLINGER:
Then it's been effective?
Not as yet.
But we've only begun to attack the sites of infection.
I think her tonsils and adenoids will have to come out.
And if that fails to bring improvement, her colon will have to go as well.
(ELEANOR WHIMPERS)
- Fuck.
Fuck.
- (MOANING)
Jesus.
Get off him, Junia.
HERMAN:
Fuck.
That's more than I expected from you, Herm.
But what I got in my pocket is less than I expected from you.
You missed a payment again.
I thought after the favor I did you at the hospital...
- You don't miss a payment!
- (GROANING)
I made that clear, you dim fuck.
And then you come to my place and blow money on whores?
I just wanted to see my girl.
She's my girl.
They're all my girls!
And that was my money you spent to plug my girl.
Show him a blue burner, Jimmy.
- HERMAN:
No, no, no, no.
- Take 'em away!
Or I'll give you 10 like you won't forget.
(WHIMPERING) Please.
(HERMAN YELLS)
- (HERMAN GASPING) - (JIMMY LAUGHING)
HERMAN:
Oh, fuck.
Nothing breaks a man like a good cock punch.
Seen it kill a fellow once.
Your change purse seems to be holding its own, though, Herm.
But it's swelling.
To the size of a billposter's bucket.
(MEN LAUGHING)
I'm tacking on a grand for being late and doubling your rate for it being a repeated offense.
(HERMAN BREATHING HEAVILY)
I'll get some ice.
Stir that gravy, Duchess.
Don't want the sugar in there to candy up.
Yes, ma'am.
Joella, take that turkey out, but don't carve it yet.
That meat needs to rest.
Algie, you come to help your mama?
Oh, I'd only get in the way.
Don't let him fool you, girls.
This boy can cook as good as his mama taught him to.
Glazes a ham better than any of them chefs over in Paris.
Thought I'd come by a little early for the lunch today.
Is Cornelia out of her room yet?
Woke up feeling bad.
Been sitting in the parlor.
Girl has the wedding jitters if you ask me.
I'll check on her.
Always so considerate.
No one can see in.
They can all see in.
Are you...
Are you all right?
It's done.
Was it terrible?
It was our child.
I wanted to be there with you.
I did.
But I couldn't.
You understand?
I think we made a mistake.
Yes, our affair was the mistake.
No.
You were looking for a risk to take and I just happened to be it.
- No, that is not true.
- That is true.
Now we are living with the consequences of that.
And we should be grateful
- to have escaped with our skin.
- (SCOFFS)
Now we have to be realistic.
I don't want to be realistic.
You never have wanted to be realistic.
(SIGHS)
You will marry Phillip.
He's a good man and the two of you will have many splendid, healthy children together.
And this...
All of this mess will barely be a memory.
No.
I don't think I should attend the luncheon today.
Please convey my regrets.
ZINBERG:
In front of you is a man, age 32, suffering from splenic anemia.
Now this is evident in the slight green coloration of the skin.
(CLOCK TICKING)
This disease is rare, insidious, and up until now prognosis was anything but hopeful.
Unfortunately, gentlemen, it is only too true that the entire subject of blood making and blood breaking is as yet very imperfectly understood.
But I believe the answer lies right in the name of the disease itself.
The spleen.
I thought you were at lunch at the Robertsons'.
This seemed more interesting.
Where are the atomizers?
He doesn't use them.
He says they're as modern as dinosaurs.
I am now going to separate the spleen from the splenic artery.
Suction.
More clamps, if you please.
We are through.
The patient still has a long road of convalescing ahead of him.
And we have a long road ahead of us in fully understanding this disease and how our blood behaves.
However, we may not be as far off as we once believed.
My distinguished colleague Dr. Karl Landsteiner of Vienna and I have been working together.
And if our experiments continue to prove successful, we will soon propose to you, gentlemen, that we are not of all the same blood, but, in fact, of three distinct bloods.
(MEN MURMURING)
THACKERY:
The question is why do transfusions fail?
(SIGHS) Multiple reasons.
The principle being that the transfused blood begins clotting in the new body, immediately killing the recipient.
And that is where we'll start unlocking the mystery.
I'll need both your bloods.
For what purpose?
For the purpose of beating Zinberg and not allowing him to bask in another triumph.
ALGERNON:
This is one of the main focuses of his research.
He's already around the track and we are at the starting line.
THACKERY:
Look, the man upstaged us at the medical conference.
Our exceptional hernia presentation had to play second fiddle to his gadget.
He then arrives at our theater acting all innocent when it is clear that his only intention is to spy and to steal.
There is a difference between wishing to learn and collaborate and looking to steal another man's work.
Zinberg is a thief!
He's a fake.
He steals other people's work and he passes it off as his own.
And I am not allowing him to do it again.
From now on, this will be my main focus.
Beginning today, Dr. Edwards, you will take the lead in all surgeries while I concentrate on this.
Um...
Until when?
Until we win one of those new Nobel Prizes.
Dr. Thackery.
Dr. Thackery.
You need to take a moment and consider yourself.
You are, if I may say, acting irrationally.
And I...
I think the cause may be more pharmaceutical in nature than you realize.
I did not ask what you think.
I told you what to do.
- Bertie.
- Yes?
Come here.
You much of a bleeder?
- I don't believe so.
- Hold still.
Okay.
Oh!
Ow!
Yes.
I'm gonna need you for a special assignment.
Okay.
You've got to find out everything you can about Zinberg.
What he's doing, how far along he is in his research.
How?
Well, he's a man who believes in sharing.
Test that theory.
(DOOR OPENS)
(CLEARS THROAT)
I need to speak with you urgently.
In private.
I want you to introduce me to your Chinaman.
Who?
The one they brought in here after you saved his life.
I need you to call in the favor he owes you.
Why?
For what?
I want him to kill Bunky Collier for me.
(LAUGHING)
What are you talking about?
You have to ask him for me.
I have no choice.
What is this?
What have...
What have you gotten yourself into?
I owe him.
I owe him nearly $10,000 and it's growing every day.
Every minute that we stand here,
I'm incurring more debt than any man could fairly pay in a lifetime.
(SNIFFLES)
And you want me to ask a favor of Ping Wu?
You're talking about bargaining with the devil, Herman.
You know, Wu is not a man to get involved with.
He doesn't believe he can die.
And from the scars on him, he might be telling the truth.
CORNELIA:
Oh...
- It's lovely.
- Thank you.
Ivory?
Yes, it's carved from the tusk of the elephant Frederick shot on safari last year.
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.
Perfectly exquisite.
And now for something old.
Eunice.
CORNELIA:
Oh, they're stunning.
They belonged to Hobart's mother,
Phillip's grandmother.
It was Hobart who thought you'd look beautiful in them.
Thank you.
Use them well.
I will.
Everett.
Everett.
(NURSES SCREAMING)
(GALLINGER GRUNTING)
THACKERY:
What the hell?
Gentlemen!
Gentlemen, stop this right now!
What is going on here?
He attacked me!
- You destroyed my life!
- You destroyed yourself.
Dr. Gallinger, you are suspended from service until you straighten yourself out.
(GALLINGER PANTING)
Everett.
Everett.
- For God's sake, man...
- John, you gave up on me.
Edwards was not my hire.
You were my choice.
And if you had to make that choice again, would I still be it?
I didn't think so.
Take some time.
Go home, collect yourself.
Come back a new man who can give Edwards a run for his money.
Go home to what?
You were all I had left.
Now look at you.
Don't you look antiseptic.
Perhaps you can complete your task by sneezing into my patient.
Earlier, you spoke of the coagulation problem in transfusion.
Now it's been accepted into fact that normal blood takes 9.28 minutes to coagulate.
You are conversing with me about your experiments now?
How much more evidence of your absurd behavior do you need?
- I am on to something that cannot wait.
- (SCOFFS)
So normal blood takes 9.28 minutes to coagulate, but if you administer citric acid, then that time increases.
That could mean that each individual has varying levels of citric acid in their blood which we have yet to discover.
Yes, but the coagulation time also increases with certain diseases.
Tuberculosis or leukemia, for example.
And decreases with others.
How do you explain that, then?
Silk suture, please.
(MAN COUGHING)
I want blood samples from everyone on the ward.
Not the patients.
The nurses and the orderlies.
I'm glad you contacted me, Dr. Chickering.
Well, my father's been after me about it for a while now.
Well, he only wants a good situation for you.
And I have that with Thackery.
- Yet here you sit.
- (CHUCKLES)
I won't take a pupil from his mentor, despite your father's request that I do so.
Well, he doesn't quite understand.
Dr. Thackery must be a good man and an excellent influence for you to have such loyalty.
I wanted to collaborate with Thackery.
Your brain surgery, our blood work.
Your hernia and previa procedures, our endoscope.
We could have been excellent partners.
I don't think Thackery believed you were being sincere.
I only want to solve problems and help people.
I'm sure Dr. Thackery feels similarly.
Of course.
We're close on the blood types.
We're learning more every day.
Imagine being able to safely transfuse.
The lives saved.
But we're stuck.
The final hurdle is proving harder to negotiate than we imagined.
What's this?
It's what I was going to present to the next society meeting.
It's what we have so far.
Call it a show of good faith.
I'm not concerned with who figures it out as long as it gets solved.
Ch.
I don't know what to say.
Say you'll help us.
If Thackery agrees to collaborate, put our minds together and find the answer, the documents are his.
If not...
I will trust you to do with them what you think is right.
WU:
Why did Thackery not come?
Why did he send you?
Do you mind if we speak alone?
(SPEAKING CANTONESE)
This is not an average request.
Thackery works for me.
And I need to protect him.
And if this goes wrong, it can't lead back to him.
That's why I'm here instead.
What does he want?
To have you make good on your debt to him for saving your life.
He owes a great deal of money to Bunky Collier.
And Collier's threatened Thack's life.
Abused him terribly.
He's beaten him, humiliated him,
and dealt with him unfairly.
He wants Collier dead.
He said that?
His words?
Are you sure that's what he wants?
Very.
Let me take you home.
We can sleep and see how it looks to you in the morning.
No.
He's too far ahead.
He could be getting ready to publish next week.
Would you fetch me some of my medicine, please?
What?
I don't like what it's doing to you.
I don't care what you like.
I need to work.
I need to concentrate.
So, please, just do as you're told.
- John...
- Now, Nurse Elkins.
You see what it's doing to him?
I do.
Then leave it here.
- Let him go without it.
- I can't.
You haven't seen the alternative.
I have.
It's much worse.
Excuse me.
(INAUDIBLE)
Neely, I told him.
I told Phillip if he presented San Francisco as a fait accompli, you would feel the way you're feeling now.
- What are you going to do?
- What do you mean?
Are you getting married tomorrow?
I have to.
Neely, doll.
You're a Robertson.
There are ways.
Can we talk about you, please?
How are you?
How's San Francisco?
I don't know if you've noticed, but Dad isn't...
Isn't Dad anymore.
He's not...
Not the same.
Has something happened between you two?
No.
No, I'm talking about the business.
When I arrived in San Francisco, things were a mess.
I spent most of the last year trying to renegotiate some of the deals he made.
They would have proved fatal to the company if I hadn't.
If that's true, it makes me sad.
Me, too.
Oh!
Good morning, miss.
I didn't expect to find you awake.
Couldn't sleep.
- It is a big day.
- Yes.
After you, sir.
Everything you could ever want.
- Morning, Harry.
- Thomas.
Lot of good stuff in these Sears catalogs.
You get pianos, headstones, ovens.
- You looking for anything?
- What do you mean?
Something for yourself.
Something nice like you always wanted.
Like a fancy table clock or a repeating rifle.
Why on Earth would I want a rifle?
Bears.
- Here?
- It was in the papers.
Pet shop man lost his out of his front yard in Brooklyn last week.
Attacked a granny and the postman before they took it down.
Thank you for your kindly offer, but I'll be fine.
Me, I'm thinking about getting one of these fancy new automobiles.
Learning to drive it proper.
Only $495.
Hah!
Says in here all you need is an electric plug and a...
What was it?
- Desire.
- Desire for adventure.
(LAUGHS)
Can you picture me piloting one of them around the city?
Imagine all the escaped bears you could find.
I must be going.
Enjoy your daydreaming.
Ah!
Dreaming is for blokes not smart enough to get what they want.
- Have fun at today's big event.
- Cleary.
CLEARY:
Please give Mrs. Robertson my deepest appreciations.
We are all blessed to know her this fine day.
Bertie the Wise.
You saw Zinberg?
I did.
- You have information for me?
- I do.
Hold that thought, Dr. Chickering, because I, as of 6:41 this morning, have solved this rotten riddle.
See, I at first thought the answer lay in the blood's coagulability, but Dr. Edwards showed me the error of my thinking.
I then began to hypothesize that the number of red blood cells per cubic millimeter is what differentiates us.
But as we know, that number can fluctuate for multiple reasons.
Sickness, altitude...
And aren't there around six million blood cells per cubic millimeter?
Exactly.
And as I was about 9,000 cells into a count of one of my samples, I found something.
It's not the number, it's the size.
In some cases, there were 75% that were 7.5 microns.
In others, it was only 25%.
I studied sample after sample.
And then a beautiful pattern emerged.
Come, take a look.
Come.
Come.
See, this is the group that was 75% at 7.5 microns.
Look.
Okay, this one is 60%.
Look.
This was 42.
Twenty-five.
And finally, 18%.
Zinberg was wrong.
It's not three types, it's actually five.
Do you see?
Honestly, no.
It's there, damn it.
I know it's a Sunday, but that's no reason to leave your brain in bed.
Come on and wake up.
Wake up.
Look again.
(PANTING)
I doubt even the great Zinberg will have reached that conclusion.
Has he?
Your look tells me he has.
No, he has not.
So we have won.
What he's found is remarkable.
And he's open to sharing it.
I think he's quite sincere in his pledge to collaborate, and if you would just be willing to share...
Oh, and let him gain the glory on the backs of our ingenuity?
- I honestly do not think that is his intention.
- No, we will be first!
And we will be first without him!
Were you followed?
Followed?
No.
What do you mean?
He's got, you know, people, spies everywhere.
Maybe you're one of them.
Thack, I am no such thing.
And I think you need rest.
All right, you can go.
Did he enlist you in this?
I volunteered.
Can you still do what I asked?
It's all arranged.
- (INDISTINCT TALKING) - (WOMAN COUGHING)
She's perfect.
Her anemic condition was brought about by chlorosis.
They've tried arsenic, bone marrow, hydrotherapy.
Nothing's worked.
Maybe we shouldn't interfere.
The patient is sick enough.
It seems cruel.
She's got nothing else.
Let's give her a chance.
A transfusion of blood may be just what's needed.
(CLOCK TICKING)
Well...
This is certainly your lucky day.
When you wake up, you'll be cured.
Nurse Elkins.
Blood is flowing.
Pulse is rapid.
Pulse is erratic.
Pulse is weakening.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
LUCY:
What's happening?
THACKERY:
It's not working.
I have no pulse.
Fuck.
John.
What have I done?
(INDISTINCT TALKING)
(COINS CLATTER)
(QUIETENING DOWN)
(CHOIR SINGING)
- (PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY) - (BELL TOLLING)
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Bertie.
Excuse me.
- Bertie.
- Lucy, what's wrong?
- It's Dr. Thackery.
- (CROWD CHEERING)
Congratulations, mate!
(MUMBLING)
BERTIE:
Thackery.
LUCY:
John.
John.
John, it's the drug.
It's destroying you.
John.
You need to stop.
I can't.
- John.
- I can't stop.
We'll find someone who can help you.
Right, Bertie?
(SNIFFLING)
So it's all true, then?
THACKERY: (SOBBING) I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.
Dear God.
- Bertie.
- What?
Please.
I don't know what to do.
You think I know what to do with this madness?
- You have to help him.
- (SHOUTING) I don't have to do anything!
Please, Bertie.
Whoa.
Mr. Cleary?
- That's me.
- Got something for you.
Thank you.
- (URGES HORSE) - (CLEARY CHUCKLING)
(LAUGHING)
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)
Sit him up, please.
How much cocaine have you injected today, doctor?
THACKERY:
Twelve grams.
That's quite a tolerance.
You've seen people in his condition before?
In my practice, more than a bit these days.
Women of a certain breeding who have become dependent on the drug.
Can you help him?
In the meantime, keep him comfortable.
(GROANING)
Your man is no more.
He wasn't my man, Mr. Ping.
He was causing Thackery the trouble, remember?
His request.
And I am sure he'll be grateful you came by to let us know.
(CHUCKLES)
I've known Thackery a long time.
He loves my woman, my opium.
He always pays.
But you...
Where did you get that?
From Collier's desk.
A man who owes me $9,000 as long as you owe Collier would be fed to my pigs.
That book is not...
I can read left to right, not just up and down.
This my book now.
I was so close.
What?
What did you just say?
I was so close with that girl.
No, you weren't.
I read Zinberg's papers.
There's nothing to do with the size of the blood cells.
It has to do with the agglutinating antibodies.
Certain people have one type, others another.
You were off by a mile.
Hello.
Dr. Chickering.
I believe Dr. Hackett is expecting us.
Would you empty your pockets, please?
Is there someone you would like to list as the next of kin?
BERTIE:
There's nothing you can do for him now.
There's no use in sitting there worrying about him.
Perhaps you could advance us the drugs and we could pay you once we've charged the patients.
Your patients can't pay.
This has always been the Church's issue with the Knick.
Your policies create dependency.
Why would they advance us anything?
Our chief surgeon is gone.
His predecessor killed himself.
And the only man left here with a scalpel is a Negro.
But there is a solution.
Same one we've had all along.
Close the Knick and move uptown.
The decision has to be made now.
Metropolitan Hospital has made an offer for my land uptown.
I can't hold it for us any longer.
In light of all that's happened here,
I think it's time we bring this matter to a vote.
All in favor of shuttering this place and moving the Knick uptown?
ALL:
Aye.
(SIGHING) Then... it's decided.
Welcome to Cromartie Hospital.
I'm Dr. Hackett.
When Dr. Chickering Sr. Called ahead on your behalf, he asked that you be registered under an alias to protect your privacy.
Is there a name that you prefer?
THACKERY:
Crutchfield.
HACKETT:
Excellent.
Favorite teacher?
THACKERY:
My mother.
HACKETT:
You have been steered to the right place.
Thank you.
As our reputation has grown, we've begun to specialize in treating cocaine madness.
The withdrawal of the drug from your system will be the hardest part.
Well, from the looks of you, you've done enough damage to yourself already.
We here at Cromartie Hospital believe that the pain of detoxification is counterproductive to restoring your health.
So we have developed a series of treatments designed to ease your suffering.
Including a miraculous medication that can virtually eliminate the misery of withdrawal.
And don't worry.
It's from Bayer, the aspirin company.
Safe as can be.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Rest assured, these treatments will only be for the first month or two.
Time to start getting better.
(SIGHS)
Ripped By mstoll
When I was a girl and we drove past the coal mines, it looked like a story book to me.
It seemed an army of men was doing something so important it could change the world.
That's when Mama would say,
"Every time you light a lamp to read,"
"you can thank a coal miner."
I was born and raised in the hills of Virginia when coal was king.
Life was simple in Big Stone Gap.
You went to Zackie's for your jeans, you went to Gilley's for your engagement ring.
And you went to my family drugstore when you were sick.
On Friday nights you rooted for the Vikings, and after the game, you went for burgers at Carmine's to celebrate, because we never lost.
Every year we put on The TrailoftheLonesomePine , the story of a mountain girl and the mining engineer who loved her.
You either acted a part or played in the band or worked behind the scenes, like me.
One year was a lot like the last, and before I knew it, it was 1978 and I turned 40.
Almost overnight,
I was the old maid in Big Stone Gap.
It seemed like happiness was for other people.
Morning, beautiful.
I don't know why you're honking the horn,
I'm standing out here black as night, I know you can see me.
Oh, good, you got Miss Weston's stuff right for the first time.
Yeah, I'm gonna give you something else if you don't leave me alone.
Morning, Nan.
Cherry pie was just wonderful.
Thank you.
It was rhubarb.
Them last ones you brought over here blocked me up.
Doc Daugherty swears these won't.
You just need to take them with some buttermilk in your stomach.
I got coffee on.
Biscuits and gravy.
Well, I can't stay.
I've got two more hollers to hit.
Oh, come on.
One cup won't keep you.
Jeepers Christmas, Jack!
Put some clothes on.
Yes, ma'am.
Morning, Jack.
Morning.
You'll have to excuse my son.
He was out till all hours last night with that Sweet Sue Tinsley.
That ain't a girl built for heavy lifting.
Woman has a man around doesn't have to do a lot of heavy lifting.
Well, I don't know what he's thinking.
Sure you do.
Sweet Sue Tinsley?
Come on.
She's a catch.
Prettiest girl in high school.
She made a bikini in Home-Ec and it won the blue ribbon.
Modeled it in front of Assembly.
Brought half the crowd to their feet at least.
I'll bet.
Beat the heck out of my apron.
Well, she's a flaunter, all right.
And she's got a big mess over there with that divorce and all them kids.
You ever want you some young'uns?
No, it's not gonna happen for me.
It is never too late.
My own mamaw was an old maid, too.
Almost 43 when she had my daddy.
She had a baby one week, then done went into the change the next.
Anything can happen.
What are y'all whispering about?
Ooh, I got to scoot.
Eula Belcher's all seized up and in dire need of her muscle relaxers.
Oh...
See her out, Son.
All right.
Thank you very much and that's all right, I'll see myself out.
No, no.
Best not to argue with Mama.
Here, let me help you.
Here you go.
Easy.
You have very soft hands for a coal miner.
No, I got calluses.
That's how I follow the seams in the rock to the coal.
Hey, hold on!
Come here, I want to show you something.
Like my new truck?
1978 Ford pickup.
Four-wheeler, fully loaded.
Right fancy.
Nobody ever accused me of being fancy.
It's a pickup, not a Caddy.
Hey.
You going to the party on opening night?
Of course I am.
Theodore's taking me.
Are you ever gonna marry him?
You been talking to Fleeta?
Just one of the girls, ain't you?
I always took you for the strong, silent type.
You ain't scared of them strays, are ya?
No.
Who are you afraid of?
Howdy, Mama!
Did you eat?
Oh, not a bite all day.
Oh, I pack up a dinner for you.
Who has got time to eat?
The whole town is a-flutter with our final dress rehearsal.
Oh, you know, I cast everybody from here to Keokee whether they have talent or are lacking.
You choose them, they have talent.
I know this.
Oh, so, the box office.
You sell the tickets?
No idea.
Whole town's in the dang thing.
There's nobody left to set for it.
Johnny Wood, he made the announcement on the radio,
WCYB.
Well, I have to say that the poster in the pharmacy window is gorgeous and we did manage to paper Scott, Dickenson and Lee Counties.
That'll bring 'em in some.
I know this.
You're gonna get a good crowd.
I work you too hard.
You're exhausted.
You need to sleep.
Don't worry about me, carissima.
Dr. Daugherty said the new pills, they work.
I'm sewing the last seam on the last costume.
Ave, let's go!
And do not forget my costume!
Oh, Aspetta.
Theodore's costume.
Thank you.
"And I shall rise on the third day."
Come...
Ave, where are you?
Let's go!
You are the director!
You cannot be late!
Oh, aspetta!
Tayloe!
Tayloe's costume!
Say "break a leg," just like a professional.
Break a leg.
I'm coming, I'm coming!
Costume looks great, Mrs. Mulligan!
This is The Trail of the Lonesome Pine, and my name is June Tolliver.
I left here a poor mountain girl, and have returned...
I have returned...
A lady?
A lady.
I don't fit in.
All right, just stop.
My teeth hurt.
Tayloe, learn your lines!
All right.
Yes.
Everybody, thank you so very much!
Will you please leave your costumes on the rack?
Hey y'all!
We're officially sold out for opening night!
Where's Spec?
Right here.
This is bigger than a four alarm fire!
I need you real bad, Spec.
We're full up!
Order another keg.
Consider it done, Iva Lou.
Long as I get the first dance.
You're the sexiest librarian in four counties, Iva Lou!
Okay, Sweet Sue, you're on.
Come down the aisle.
Up.
Up.
Up.
Lam going over to Carmine's for a burger.
You want to come?
Uh, not right now.
I have to run lines with the star.
Uh, I know my lines.
Good job on the timing of that cue.
Thank you.
And I do suspect that little Penny Coomer has a crush on you.
You're it!
Appears she's already over me, ma'am.
Jack, honey!
I swear, sometimes we make music like we belong in the Grand Ole Opry.
Hardly puts me in the mind of Minnie Pearl, you displaying that leotard.
Why, thank you.
Okay, Pearl.
I don't care if everybody goes home naked...
Ave.
I need you to come here.
You need to come with me.
You gotta get Duke McMillan.
I'm staying late.
He knows CPR.
Darling, it's not a Rescue Squad run.
It's your mama.
Come on.
No one worries about you like your mother.
And when she's gone, the world seems unsafe.
You can't turn to her anymore and it changes your life forever.
Hey, Miss Ave.
You probably don't remember me, but my name's Bobby Dinsmore from over on Skeens Ridge.
Well, sure I do.
I used to play the sax in the band.
Mmm-hmm.
Your mama made me this here uniform, 'cause they didn't have one big enough to fit me at the factory.
I bet you nobody knew it was homemade.
Well, it still looks right nice on you, Mr. Bobby.
All of you look right pretty, as a matter of fact.
Since our almighty God has called our sister, Fiammetta Onicelli Mulligan from this life, to himself, we commit her body to the earth from which it came.
Give her eternal rest, O Lord, and may your light shine on her forever.
Don't cry, Fleets.
When are you gonna cry?
I can't.
Why would you put a rose on your daddy's grave after he treated you like such dirt?
Maybe he'll do something kind and look out for Mama when she gets there.
I do not like that sign.
The N fell off.
My brother kept this building pristine.
You've let the place go to hell!
Why Aunt Alice, I can't believe you haven't heard.
In honor of Mommy's memory,
Mutual's has officially gone Italian.
From now on, everything around here is gonna end in a vowel.
My brother Fred'd be ashamed!
Sail on, Alice.
Alice, sail on.
Thank you for the pineapple upside down cake.
It was delicious.
I did not send it.
It was not mine.
Mine was a Texas sheet cake, which I hope you froze.
I did, right next to my emotions.
Well, you know, Alice Lambert wouldn't have a reason to mess with you if you had a husband.
You know, I know Theodore's a Yankee, but, hell, at this point, you just gotta take whatever you can get.
I like being the town spinster.
It has cachet, Fleeta.
Yeah, well, you can't hug cachet.
Well, thanks for stopping by, Doug Kilgore.
You tell that peanut farmer that I say, "Hi."
Thank you, Spec.
You take care, now.
Mr. Broadwater will see you now, Ave.
Tell your mama and them I said, "Hi." I will.
Come on in, darling.
Take a seat.
Yeah.
Ave, how long I been a lawyer?
Long time.
And what I learned is this.
When people die, that's when all the secrets come out.
Earl, shut the damn door!
I swear that boy hasn't got the sense that God gave a screwdriver.
Anyway-
A while back, your mama came in to see me about doing her will, which I did.
And when I was gonna notarize it, she added the letter.
I don't understand.
You will when you read it, darling.
You best take a deep breath.
I'll send the rest of the files to you, Miss Ave.
"...too ashamed and never told them about my angel girl.
Mama."
How did this happen?
She was already pregnant when she left Italy.
And she was too ashamed to tell her family.
Came and found work as a seamstress, so...
Fred Mulligan felt sorry for her and married her.
Which explains why he never liked me.
'Cause I'm not even his.
This is my father.
Well, this sure explains your nose.
Ave, he's pretty suave.
Yeah.
Very.
You gonna go find him?
Why would he want me?
No man ever did.
I do.
Hey!
Ave!
Pull over!
Pull over!
Wise County Bookmobile.
Next stop, Shawnee Avenue.
Wait!
Don't go!
I got two check-outs for you.
Don't go.
Okay.
This is my favorite book on Chinese face reading.
No, no.
I've read the face of every man I've ever known.
It's never been wrong.
You really think face reading's true?
It never fails.
I gotta say.
I'm not one bit surprised you're out here crying, all tore up and all alone.
You got a perfect little cupid's bow on your lip, which means you are proud and private and romantic.
See?
Yeah, but all that information is useless if you don't love.
Now, that's where old Charlotte Bronte comes in with her Jane Eyre.
Miss Bronté can write her a love scene.
"Yearning and longing."
"Longing and yearning."
Nothing will take your mind off your tragedy than a good romance.
I haven't seen this since I was a girl.
Yeah, well, it's time for a revisit.
And take notes, honey.
Please, take notes.
Call you later!
My book report, but I hate Moby Dick.
My gosh, I love those shoes.
May I borrow them for my barbecue tonight?
Why, thank you.
Bobby's gonna be there.
So I'm gonna pick up some lipstick for that, too.
Totally.
Hey, Miss Ave?
Got my prescription ready?
Not yet.
She's so slow.
I don't understand what takes her so long, right?
Hey, ladies!
Put that lipstick down.
And do not touch any more magazines, because our patrons like them untouched.
Virginal.
If prescriptions didn't take so long, we wouldn't read 'em, Fleeta.
Don't make me call your mother.
It's Pearl Grimes.
Look at her!
She is the ugliest thing I have ever seen.
So sad.
Well, you know she's a mess.
I mean, that clothing.
You know it's from Goodwill.
Think about all the people that have worn that before, and she's putting it on her daughter...
Tayloe Slagle.
Your birth control pills are ready over at the counter.
Your birth control pills are ready.
Thank you so much for trading at Mutual's.
Hope to see you soon.
I can't believe...
Can you believe she just...
Let's go!
Come on, girls.
From now on
I'm getting my pills in Appalachia.
They're not very bright.
I'd rather be pretty and stupid like them than what I am.
Mmm, no, you wouldn't.
Pretty fades, honey.
Stupid, it's annoying.
They got talent, too.
They baton twirl.
It's not a talent one calls upon later in life.
Well, I ain't got no talent.
And I ain't good at nothing.
Mmm...
You know, it's just Fleeta and me around here.
We could use a hand.
Me?
You want to give me a job?
What do you say?
We ain't got no car.
I mean, how am I gonna get here?
I run all over these hills, hon.
Wouldn't be nothing for me to pick you up.
You could start by tackling that big pile of junk sitting there, and take some of that out back for me?
That'd be a big help.
Okay.
Thanks.
So, this is your idea of the new employee?
You know, she don't keep herself very nice.
You just don't like Melungeons.
No, I don't.
But she'll do.
This is the box office speaking.
We are sold out!
If you don't have a ticket, then you do not have a seat.
I repeat, if you don't have a ticket, then you do not have a seat.
I've asked you a dozen times, it is the penultimate moment in the play.
I mean, have you ever seen West Side Story?
It's like, if Chino died of an epileptic seizure.
What is supposed to happen is very simple.
Point the gun at me.
Thank you, Virgil.
No.
Wait a minute.
Is that a prop?
You know what?
Point it away.
It's supposed to be a shot and then blood.
But what we have here is a shot, no blood!
Okay, Mr. Tipton, let me tell you.
I'm gonna take this here tube and I'm gonna rig it right up your pants...
I can't act with a tube in my pants!
Oh, for crying out loud!
I am so sorry, honey.
Just go make sure that Sweet Sue has her underpants on.
Now, you listen to me!
These temper tantrums may have gotten you results at the Bucks County Playhouse, but around here we do peaceable on opening night.
We do peaceable on opening night because you cannot train amateurs to be professionals.
And let me tell you something.
At the Bucks County Playhouse, we had a prop master.
I had a prop master.
And then they added a night shift to the Quik Mart and he had to resign.
Naturally.
I am doing the best I can.
You could put a broom up my ass and I would sweep the floor at the same time.
Now, we will use two squibs.
If one doesn't go off, then the other one will.
Okay.
Sounds reasonable.
Excellent.
Michelangelo said, "Genius is eternal patience."
Another know-it-all Italian.
Five minutes to curtain!
Final touches and places, everybody.
Places, all right, let's go.
Final touches!
Wait.
Someone's locked me out of my dressing room!
Okay.
Places, everyone!
Good job.
Music.
Mr. MacChesney just winked at you.
No, he didn't.
He's got something in his eye.
Yes, he did.
I saw him.
Well, look.
I believe I need a seat.
I believe you're drunk, sir.
That's my Jade East cologne.
Do you like it?
Even if I did, we're sold out.
I didn't catch your name.
Lyle Makin.
How did you hear about our outdoor extravaganza?
Well, I came to see Jack Mac.
We grew up together.
Well, now I live up in Crackers Neck Holler.
Well, I should visit Crackers Neck often.
And Holler.
On...
And on the third day
I shall rise from the ashes of regret
like a phoenix!
Oh, no!
Howard, shoot him again!
Shoot!
Shoot him again!
Like a phoenix!
Have a heart attack!
Have a heart attack!
Get struck by lightning!
Good job.
Everybody dance!
Ow!
Watch it, Sue!
You're too late!
The opening night party is for cast and crew only.
Everyone else is welcome to use their two-for-one coupons at Carmine's.
Leave in an orderly fashion.
Oh, my God.
You are a wildcat.
You know it.
Come to Ding Daddy!
Happy to!
Oh!
Ladies, meet Lyle Makin.
Hello, Lyle.
He got the last seat in the theater.
Really?
Mmm-hmm.
Then where was you setting?
On his lap.
Mmm-hmm.
Where can I get something to drink?
That way.
Ladies.
Iva Lou, I'll see you at the keg.
There's something to this one.
I think he wants more than a rendezvous at the High Knob with a fifth of Night Train and a sack of Cab's donuts.
And you got all that from setting on his lap?
No, ma'am.
Chinese face reading.
He's got the chin of an emperor.
Iva Lou?
Hmm?
You don't need a book to learn what to do with a man.
Now, me and Krifflum, we are still having intimate relations.
Even though I'm in the middle of the change.
And I'll tell you something else.
This is an old toaster.
But when he plugs it in...
What a magnificent opening night!
Give yourselves a hand!
I have wonderful news.
In a few short weeks, Mr. John Warner, candidate for senator of Virginia, will be making a campaign stop in Big Stone Gap, with his movie star wife,
Elizabeth Taylor!
My God!
We have to feed 'em and entertain 'em.
And if you'd like to help there are sign-up sheets for committees in the Tolliver House.
Theodore Tipton, you're in charge of the show!
Now I'm gonna turn the stage over to Sweet Sue Tinsley, the president-elect of The Foxes, our volunteer ushers.
Probably gonna do a cartwheel.
Thank you, Nellie.
Ava?
Ava Marie?
As president of The Foxes, we would like to thank you for being such a good director.
Well, thank you.
Nobody hands out programs like The Foxes do.
Hey, Ave.
It ain't good to drink alone!
Who you gonna share that bottle with?
Ave Maria needs a man.
Hey, hey!
Excuse me!
She has her own man.
What just happened?
You just kissed me.
No, you kissed me.
Let's eat.
Something to eat?
Uh, no.
I'm not hungry.
I've got band practice.
And, um...
And with Elizabeth Taylor coming to town,
I'm gonna have to put on a doozy of a show, so...
I'll call you later?
Yeah.
Okay.
That oak leaf is a particularly good one.
There.
You do realize that every time you smash it like that, you rub all the glitter off, don't you?
And why would you order something that looks like...
I could've picked these up off the ground.
I like the idea of adding these going vertical like, 'cause I think for the close passerby, they're very interesting.
This is more of a sophisticated look.
Whatever you want.
I'm just gonna say,
"I'm so sorry I didn't know I was doing such a bad job."
I've been doing this windows for,
I don't know, since you was little.
Hey, Fleeta...
That's the Wence Mine.
Carmine, over here!
Hey, get in there!
We need to get him oxygen!
It's okay, pal.
We're right here.
There you go.
That's a good one.
Everyone's accounted for.
Lucky day.
Could've been a lot worse.
Spec, show me that.
Don't wait on me, honey.
Leola's here checking on her cousin.
Okay.
I'll catch a ride with her.
Jack?
You worried about little old me?
You thought I bought the farm, didn't you?
All right.
I like this.
Can I give you a lift?
Uh...
Don't be proud.
It's just a 1973 un-American 3-speed transmission.
Oh.
Thank you, ma'am.
Mind if we stop at Mutual's first?
I need a box of Clairo I so I can rinse these ma'am's out of my hair.
Well, I don't see any grays.
You haven't changed a bit since high school.
Is that a good thing?
I think so.
Take it from one who's changed.
You haven't changed at all.
Shoot.
Girls still after you.
Good at sports.
Kind to your mother.
Gary Cooper of Big Stone Gap.
Hey, you had your share of suitors.
Wayne Rutledge had a crush on you for years.
Wayne Junior's not one to be real proud of.
He's doing 7 to 10 for robbing his podiatrist 'cause his feet hurt.
Yeah, Wayne.
I heard he's still got all his hair.
After 30 you've got to put that in the plus column.
There you are!
Jack!
Hey, hey!
Honey.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Lordy.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
She's such a fawner.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Son, I heard everything on the police radio.
You done good.
You saved a man.
Your daddy would be so proud of you.
You're a hero!
No, no.
Hi, Ava.
Sue!
It's Ave, okay?
Ave.
Not Ava, like Ava Gardner.
But Ave Maria, like the prayer.
You know, we went through school for 12 years together and you never once got my name right.
Well, law me.
Sorry.
Let's go.
Peewee football team right here, junior baton twirlers here, and Liz Taylor lookalikes here.
Coca-Cola cake, 7-Up cake, or Betty Cline's blackberry cobbler?
Cobbler.
I think I have put together a show that's gonna top her entrance into Rome in Cleopatra.
I'm gonna use the outside of Fraley's Coach House...
And turn it into downtown Rome.
We're going to have a choir and festoonery and Cleopatra, the majorette.
I think I forgot to get coffee.
How could you be out?
People always dropping off their grief pies.
Oh, here's some.
It may be old, but we'll do what we can.
Oh, my lord.
Iva Lou, these are in Italian.
I think these may be letters from my father to my mother.
It's bad luck to read other people's private correspondence.
Especially when that person just passed away.
Oh, read 'em.
What does it all mean?
Not that it matters.
Everything sounds better in Italian.
Keep going.
Bliss.
Pure bliss.
Oh, If Lyle Makin could speak Italian,
I'd never let him out of my trailer.
Would you two please pay attention?
I'm under a lot of pressure here.
I've gotta be the Bob Fosse of Big Stone Gap in a parking lot.
Ave's life is important, too.
Elizabeth Taylor will come and go, but we're here forever.
All right, girls.
I'm going.
I cannot work in an environment of frivolity, when I have to dazzle the world's biggest movie star.
Oh, but the cobbler's not even thawed yet.
I'm sure there's plenty more where that came from.
Bye.
Bye.
I don't know what his problem is.
He's wound tighter than a tick.
Well, he's an artist.
He pours himself into his work.
He loves music and the theater and marching bands.
Sometimes I think he like them little soldiers more than he likes you.
How is it going in the romance department?
He wants more time.
Lordy mercy!
I never heard of a man who wanted to wait.
Go out on that truck, you pick a book.
Any book.
Read between the lines.
What does Chinese face reading say about Theodore?
His forehead says he's stubborn.
That book of yours have a follow-up, 'cause that I already know.
Tell me something new.
Honey-O.
People are talking.
You've been best friends with a man for years without getting married in this town.
That makes you a lot like Mount Vesuvius.
People are just standing around waiting for you to blow.
But there's more.
No, there's not.
I didn't want to pile on, but my Lyle's clerk in the court in Pennington Gap, and he told me Alice Lambert filed papers against you in Lee County.
But I want you know I didn't just sleep with him to get that information on your behalf.
That is so big of you, Iva Lou.
I like his mind.
I'm sure you do.
Now, get.
Love you.
Oh!
Are you okay?
Yeah!
I don't care what you say, Ave.
If there is the slightest chance that Elizabeth Taylor is gonna be riding right down here on Main Street, she might have to stop and get herself a diuretic.
She'll come in here and see all the signage.
That's what I want.
Where's that Cleopatra wig you called me about?
It's in the box right there.
Ah!
Yes!
Fleeta!
Yes.
Where's the black hair dye?
In my pocket.
You getting the last box.
Oh!
But, I just want to warn you, when you wake up tomorrow morning, you still gonna look like you, except with really dark hair.
All my life I wanted to look like Elizabeth Taylor.
And now I will.
Charge it.
You gonna be in for a shocker when you see what you look like.
Okay.
I'll have to deal with this rat's nest later.
I am late for rehearsal.
Rome has to be built in a day.
Why would you feed into this lunacy?
We should make Liz Taylor makeup kits.
These women been watching Liz Taylor up on the silver screen all their lives.
Now they believe Liz Taylor's come here 'cause she wants to watch them.
Hey, Fleeta?
Get ready, babe, you're next.
For what?
I don't see any Diahann Carroll color up in here.
History tells us,
Cleopatra was a black woman.
Afternoon, Miss Fleeta.
It's Sweet Sue Tinsley's boys!
Look, Jack, a clown!
Jared, that's not nice.
You apologize.
Sorry.
I need a tissue.
They're in the back, Miss Ave.
Can I have some candy?
Now, you know candy's very bad for your teeth.
But it is very good for your stomach, so you go on and take as much as you want.
What do you say?
Thank you.
You're very welcome.
Come on, Jared.
That's compliments of me and the clown.
Jack Mac likes Ave Maria.
Girl, you know less about men than you do about cosmetics.
If Ave would just give him a chance, she could have him.
Little girl,
Ave Maria don't stand a chance next to Sweet Sue.
Sweet Sue is a saber-toothed divorcee in need of cash.
And Jack Mac's got him a steady job.
He got no dependents.
And when his mama passes, he gonna get that house across the bridge.
And don't forget, since he was 18, he got that pension from the miners.
Now, when you look at a situation like this...
Mmm-hmm.
You realize that money in the bank means love in the heart.
You sure been seeing a lot of that Sweet Sue lately.
Seems things are getting serious.
Son, have I been a good mother?
Yes, ma'am.
Good answer.
Why do you ask?
Something wrong?
This is one of them moments when I wish your daddy was alive.
Just say it, Ma.
I don't want you to marry Sweet Sue Tinsley.
I haven't taught you the difference between love and lust.
See, true love energizes you.
Lust and all them other kinds of love just exhausts you.
All right.
No, now listen to me.
I mean, clearly, I failed you.
Of course, anything and everything that goes wrong with children is always the mother's fault.
But let me embrace my failure.
Why don't you marry some nice girl instead of that hotsy-totsy flaunter?
I'll marry whomever I please, Mama.
Well, then explain this to me.
Explain what you're doing with your life.
Mama, look at me.
Everything's passed me by.
That's not true.
You're a good man.
I want what you and Daddy had.
When I was young, I had a handle on things.
I knew who I was and what I wanted.
But I work in the dark.
And I have for 22 years.
When I come out of that mine,
I don't want complications.
I just want simple.
Well, that is the word I'd use to describe Sweet Sue.
I know you don't like her, Mama.
But I love her boys, and she's nice to me.
Well, you told me.
So, if that's your choice,
Sweet Sue will never know my true feelings.
Can I fix you some supper?
No, ma'am, I already have plans.
Okay.
I found the tissues.
You're too late.
I see that.
How about some apple butter?
Mama just put this up, wanted you to have some.
Oh, that's very kind.
Thank you.
Would you like to come in?
Yes, ma'am.
Well, how about I make you a deal?
Okay.
If you quit calling me "ma'am,"
I'll get you a beer.
Deal.
I remember the first time I was in this house.
Daddy fixed the electric here, one summer.
I don't remember you being here.
Your mama made us red pepper sandwiches.
Yeah.
Um...
This talking about food's made me hungry.
You want something to eat?
Sure.
Don't believe I got that kind of time.
What made you want to go into the mines?
Well, I couldn't wait.
When I was a boy, my daddy used to tell me stories.
He used to describe the mine, and what it was like, how quiet it could be, how dark it was,
how if you left it set long enough, that black coal would become diamonds.
That seemed almost magical to me.
Do you get scared?
Sure do.
But you do it anyway.
I'd never do much of anything if I didn't do the thing I'm afraid of.
Well, look who's at Carmine's.
Evening, Earl.
There's a special on banana pudding tonight.
Ooh.
I highly recommend it.
Y'all have a good meal.
Well, reckon you better give Sweet Sue a call before Earl does.
You think I'm a two-timer?
I broke up with Sue.
I guess I felt alone when I was with her.
What is this?
It's a bowl of soup with a coal miner.
Oh, that's a milk glass moon.
You want to see it up close?
I would dearly love to.
You got us a rocket ship?
Oh, I got a better way.
Take this.
Your mama sewed a new lining in it for me a couple of years back.
She always used satin inside coats.
It was a signature.
These are the best two seats in this whole theater, seats 5 and 7, row G,
to see the moon.
You know your numbers and your letters?
Almost all.
Thanks, Miss Callahan.
She did a right good job with you.
She tried, but I was distracted.
See, I was sitting next to this pretty Italian girl.
I always appreciated that you said my name right.
Well, that's because you matter to me.
Ave, I've got a good job.
I'm in pretty good shape.
I mean, I eat too much sometimes and I drink beer, but my heart's good, and I'm strong.
I've got some money saved.
And I got a new truck.
And I think we should get married.
Are you serious?
You don't have to answer right away.
I don't want to just get married.
I'd like to have some fun.
I mean, heck, I thought I was fixing to.
We got here, I was like, "I'd like to make love to that man."
Well, that's good.
Well, then you had to go and ruin it by asking me to marry you.
I mean, my hopes were high an hour ago.
Well, let's get 'em back up there then.
Come on.
Jack.
Well, you've been kind enough to tell me a little about yourself.
I'll tell you something about me.
Is that all right?
Yeah.
Well, I'd like to be kissed.
I'd like to be kissed like Rhett Butler, in fact, kissed Scarlett O'Hara while Atlanta was burning.
I'd like to be held the way Heathcliff embraces Catherine on the Moors.
I'd like a passion so explosive it could burn Thornfield Hall down.
I'd like a man to look at me with the whole world in his eyes,
and know exactly what to do with the rest of him to please me.
Not just an old house and a pack of stray dogs and a good pension and a new, old truck.
So, you can take your moon and your bowl of soup and your marriage proposal and shop 'em around to some other girl, 'cause it ain't me.
Good Lord.
Oh, come on.
Get in the front.
Ave, come on!
I'm not gonna ride through town with you in the back.
Please.
Fine.
Be that way.
Oh!
Hey.
Are you all right?
Ah!
Look who's here!
Finally.
You're late!
Again!
That's enough from you.
On the road.
I want you to hit your marks and do not screw this up for me.
Now, get over there!
It's here.
That bus!
Everybody, come on, storm the Bastille!
Come on.
Everyone, get in place.
Cleopatra!
Cleopatra!
You need to bring it down just a touch, Earl.
Oh, dear.
I'm sorry.
Damn it, John.
This was supposed to be fried chicken, in and out.
Yes.
Let me have this.
Is everyone in place for the show?
Tayloe?
Maggie the Cat!
Maggie the Cat!
Here she comes.
Here she comes.
Oh!
Sorry, sorry.
Miss Taylor!
I want to be your next husband!
No, don't!
Miss Taylor, Miss Taylor, Johnny Wood, WCYB-TV.
You've been married 9, 12, 10 times.
Why so many husbands?
You should always take a chance on love.
Fried chicken, Miss Taylor?
Spit it out!
Where's Doc Miranda at?
Elizabeth Taylor's choking on a chicken!
Oh, my God!
Elizabeth Taylor's visit to Big Stone Gap, Virginia, ends not with a bang, but a choking.
While sampling the local fried chicken,
Liz Taylor swallowed bone and is being taken to Lonesome Pine Hospital.
This is Johnny Wood, live for WCYB-TV in Big Stone Gap, Virginia.
Good luck.
Talk less.
At least you're not the biggest disaster of the night.
What do you say we go home, and I'll let you beat me at rummy.
That's the last thing in the world I want to do.
Have you seen Theodore?
He's despondent.
Honey-O, I got some news.
Marty Gilley from the jewelry store told me Jack Mac bought a ring.
One karat, two baguettes for Sweet Sue.
You look awful nice.
You gave Sweet Sue Tinsley a ring?
I know it seems sort of sudden.
Sudden?
I'd call that lickety-split.
What'd you do, get some out of a gumball machine that's adjustable, try it on every finger in town till somebody said yes?
Now you're just being unkind.
Unkind.
Man of few words, it doesn't take many to find the right one.
I tried with you!
Tried?
Like tried, like what?
On a job?
I'm a coal miner.
That's a lot easier work than you.
Can I ask you something?
Mmm-hmm.
Are you happy?
Darlin', happiness is a myth.
I got married when I was 15-years-old.
I got me five kids.
One a bigger disappointment than the next.
My grand kids ain't much better, neither.
'Course when you plant corn, you get corn.
If you could live your life over, what would you do different?
I'd marry me Twyla Johnson instead of the wife I got.
Twyla was the one that got away.
We all got one, you know.
You know.
That person that we ought to be with, we know we ought to be with, but circumstances have a way of
working out where you get sidetracked and end up settling.
Do you ever see Twyla?
We do have lunch every Tuesday.
My Tuesdays are content.
One out of seven days,
I live the dream.
What you gonna do with yourself, girl?
Come here.
Come on here with Spec.
Give him a big hug.
Mmm!
We don't want no trouble, Ava.
What are you doing here?
This is my family home.
I want you to leave.
The truth has come out.
Now I know your mama done come clean with you.
You ain't our kin.
You never been blood.
I know what you are.
And that's a bastard.
When I think what your mother done to my family, it almost killed my mama when Fred came home with a wop.
He married her out of pity, 'cause she was knocked up.
My brother done educated you, clothed you and fed you like you was his.
You lived like a princess here in my family home, with trips to Monticello and so forth, while I never done got as far as Roanoke.
I'll see you in court.
You give me my key.
Come on, Wayne.
We just want what's coming to us.
Can I have a grilled cheese sandwich, tapioca pudding and a coconut cake?
Black coffee for me.
Thanks.
I'm sorry I left you stranded last night, Ave, but we need to talk.
Okay.
About what?
Well, I was gonna wait to tell you this, but, um...
I just got offered the band director job at the University of Tennessee.
Chattanooga, so don't get too excited.
That's amazing.
Well, what's gonna happen to us?
We can't do this anymore.
No, we can't, can we?
We can't go around pretending we're just...
We're like other people.
Yeah, exactly.
Oh, my God, it's exhausting.
It sure is.
Oh, Ave.
You don't want me.
I'm a bad bet.
I have quirks.
You know, I'm persnickety and I'm churlish.
I'm moody, cranky, impossible, I'm...
And you know I have a terrible background.
Half my family drinks, and the other half hit the people who drink.
Theodore, do you like men?
And there's that, too.
Hope y'all are hungry!
Don't forget the coconut cake.
Coming right up!
Did you see that Liz Taylor sent a check to the hospital to thank 'em for saving her life?
I did and I felt so bad for her.
But I tell you what, I voted for her husband.
First time I ever voted Republican.
And he won.
Which just goes to show you, every vote counts.
Hey, Miss Ave.
Do you need help with any of those...
She ain't in her right mind.
I'm worried about Ave Maria.
Iva Lou says she ain't been sleeping, and I can see she ain't been eating.
She just don't look good.
Jack?
Bring down that last tree.
You have to put it in the front hall.
Now, Mary Beth, grab them balls.
This is the best Christmas show ever, Mrs. MacChesney.
Ma'am?
This show'll be spectacular.
Feeling all right?
Ave Maria, I almost gave up on you.
Hey, ladies.
Start stringing these extra lights.
Listen.
You gotta do something.
Sweet Sue is planning a New Year's Eve wedding to my son.
They're gonna get married right in front of that fireplace while the tree is still up.
Now, he is the marrying kind, and he will never leave her once that ring is on his finger.
He's just like his fool daddy.
You can love him or beat him.
But either way he'd stay.
Now, please help me give her the big heave-ho.
Do you hear me, Ave Maria?
You're gonna miss your chance with my son.
Ave?
Ave, are you okay?
Doc, what's happened to her?
This is what we call an old-fashioned nervous breakdown.
What, do we take her up to Lonesome Pine?
No, her vitals are normal.
There's no reason to take her to the hospital.
Then why's she laying there like a bag of rocks?
That's for her to figure out.
I'll come and check her in the morning.
Just let her sleep.
Might be a good idea if you don't smoke around her.
Okay.
There comes a time in every woman's life when she's gotta face her fear.
I know.
I know.
All right, whose time is it now?
It's mine.
It's my time.
Good.
Now.
A woman with a purpose is worth 10 men with the same, okay?
Now, I'm not gonna tell you exactly what to say to him, but I am gonna tell you how to say it, all right?
You're gonna march up to Jack MacChesney, and you're gonna say,
"I need to talk to you, sir."
And he's gonna hem and haw and "yep" and "nope" and look right past you, like the shower after the shift is more important than the information you need to relay.
But you are to ignore all of that.
All right?
All right.
Men are bad at communicating, but they actually have ears.
So you just need to state your piece, you know, get into that little brain of his, 'cause he's actually a pretty smart guy.
I happen to know that, 'cause he checked out Quo Vadis, from the Bookmobile and that there's a door stopper.
You just think of Ave Maria, and all she done for you.
And that'll fuel your ambition to tell him what's what.
Okay?
Okay,
All right now, scoot!
Get your books on the way back.
Mr. MacChesney.
Mr. MacChesney?
See you later, Mr. MacChesney.
We're gonna save you some water, Mr. MacChesney.
Please do.
Please do.
What is it, Pearl?
It's about Ave Maria.
She's still asleep.
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
She loves you.
She say something to you?
No, sir.
And she don't know it yet.
But according to the ancient art of Chinese face reading...
Oh, come on.
According to the ancient art of Chinese face reading, the bridge of her nose and yours match which makes you besotted, true lovers.
You handled her all wrong.
Pearl, I appreciate your interest, but you're wrong.
She don't want me.
She done told me herself.
And if there's one thing I know about women, it's when they tell you something, they mean it.
Thank you.
No!
Not Ave Maria.
She buries her feelings.
Doc thinks that's why she had that nervous breakdown.
Well, what do you want me to do about it, Pearl?
Well, I don't know.
I was hoping you could think of something.
Go on, get on.
So?
I don't know, Miss Iva Lou.
He seemed awful angry.
Passion in the pit.
That's the good news!
Let's go.
Ave Maria.
Ave Maria.
Carissima, Ave Maria.
By the time you read this, I will be gone.
Please know that of all the things I ever had to do, leaving you here without me is the most difficult.
High in the Italian Alps, you have a family.
Your father is there, and my sister.
I was too ashamed and never told them about you.
But you deserve every good thing in this life.
All the things I could not give you, for my own reasons.
Papa!
She's up!
Good God almighty.
She's up!
Come here!
Ave?
She's awake!
What happened?
Fleeta, she's awake!
Ave!
It is so cold here.
Honey.
Here, bundle up.
You're back.
You done come out of your deep sleep.
Oh, Spec.
Spec, I'm leaving.
I'm going to Italy.
I'm going to Schilpario, way up in the Italian Alps.
I've been telling you for years to go on vacation.
No.
I saw my father in a dream.
And I have to go find him.
You know, you need to calm down a little bit.
Take a deep breath.
I don't know what pills Doc Daugherty been giving her, but it's making that girl crazy.
Listen up, Ave.
Before you leave for Italy, we've gotta get everything out of your name.
Even that old Cadillac.
All right, hand me the pen.
Howdy, Miss Grimes, you remember me?
Sure do, Miss Ave.
How's your soap coming?
Good, good.
I'll have my Pearl bring you some.
Well, if you'd let me, I'd love to sell some at Mutual's.
I think people'd like that.
That'd be right nice.
She home?
She out back.
Coming, Mama!
She been trying any of that miraculous face cream on you?
Yes, ma'am.
I used to be pretty, 'fore I lost my teeth.
They say little things don't matter, but they matter if they your teeth.
You could get you some new teeth in town.
Someday, right, Mama?
Sure.
Can I have a word, Pearl?
Mama, can I go?
Yes, ma'am.
Do you happen to have a dollar?
Um, yeah, you just paid me.
I got 46.
Here, you need anymore?
Just the one'll do.
Okay.
Congratulations, dear.
You just bought yourself a drugstore.
Miss Ave, I don't understand.
Spec said I had to sell Mutual's or it'd be took from me.
So, I looked around and I thought,
"Who deserves a good turn?"
"Who knows not just what a customer needs"
"but what she secretly wants?"
"Who has just the right touch with that insecure lady,"
"who's worn red lipstick all her life and could be pushed to try the hot pink?"
"Who treats her mommy like the treasure she is?"
"Who knows everybody on those ridges and is willing to walk"
"to take them their medicine when I can't get there?"
You're the best person I know, Pearl.
And I hope you'll keep using that head of yours the way you have been because
that store will be enough to get you through college and make you a good life.
But, Miss Ave, what about you?
I'll tell you a secret.
An elegant guest knows when to leave the party.
Mama!
Who is it?
Fleeta.
Well, I just want to make sure it was you, 'cause it is time to negotiate.
'Cause if I'm gonna have to work for this little girl, and a Melungeon at that,
I feel I should be, well, compensated for my duress.
You sure about this number?
Yes, ma'am.
Then they are gonna have to carry me outta here.
Thank you.
I want you to look after Pearl.
You know this business better than anybody.
Just teach her proper.
I will.
Happy?
I'm very happy-
I'm gonna buy Krifflum a horse.
Come on in.
Wise County Bookmobile.
Next stop, Mutual's Pharmacy.
I have news!
Iva Lou!
Lyle Makin asked me to marry him and I said, "Yes!"
Oh, tra-la.
Tra-la, tra-la.
Will you be my maid of honor?
No.
Oh...
Not you.
Ave Maria.
Honey, I would love to stand with you.
Honey.
So, you're pregnant?
Lyle, keep it together.
You wouldn't know about me and Iva Lou, now?
Yep-
Come on, you, it's time!
Oh, you look beautiful.
I hate wearing white.
Do I look washed out?
You don't.
You don't.
You're not exactly blushing, but you're, uh, ruddy.
I can't do this, Ave.
Hey-
Shoot.
Iva Lou, you been drinking?
Is he drunk?
Groom's drunk.
Ave!
Hold him up, Jack.
Then the two shall be one.
Amen.
Hang on!
Don't make me go in there.
Hi, Miss Nellie.
Think pink!
Oh, how could we not?
Not yet, not yet!
I'm not ready!
No!
You okay, Lyle?
All right, darling.
Let's get you married.
Lord have mercy.
Is anybody at this wedding sober?
Doesn't look like it.
Where is he?
Where is he?
He's right here.
No.
Preacher, I think we're ready.
Let's do this, we got them.
Hurry!
I now pronounce you man and wife.
You know, this was the dumbest wedding I've ever seen.
I mean, every...
People that old just ought to elope.
I heard it was touching.
Sure, it was touching, if you like wrestling.
Hey, Mama.
Hi, Miss Fleeta.
How you doing?
Mama, show Miss Fleeta.
What?
Let me see.
Oh, those look good, girl!
Those look good!
Well, now I'm seeing that being pretty has its benefits.
That's right. 'Cause you know, every woman's beautiful.
Now, some is prettier than others.
But all women are beautiful.
Hey.
Would you care to dance?
Um...
Well, I think I bruised my hip in the fall and in these shoes my feet are a couple of bloody stumps.
So, no thank you.
You want a bag of ice?
Where is she?
Where is she?
Where is she?
I'm right here, Aunt Alice.
You may think you won, but you ain't, Ava Marie.
You are not gonna ruin this wedding reception, Aunt Alice.
It ain't like anybody's gonna remember it anyway.
You gave my brother's pharmacy to Pearl Grimes.
I sure did.
That belongs to me and my family.
Not anymore.
Well, that may be gone.
But I want this house back, and I'm gonna get it.
Oh, Aunt Alice.
You're just awful.
You're about to ruin my surprise.
Pearl!
Get in here, hon.
It would not be right for you to own a business in town and have to tote yourself all the way back and forth from Insko.
And I don't want you to be away from your mommy that much.
This house is yours.
Oh, my God!
Miss Ave?
You giving us the house?
Oh, I hope you live here in joy and peace.
You sweet little thing.
You done give my house to that Melungeon?
My mama's Melungeon.
That's right.
Mine is too.
I married a Melungeon.
I'm a Melungeon.
I'm a Melungeon, too.
I think it's time for you two to turn tail and leave.
You've done about insulted everybody here.
Including the Melungeons.
The newly married.
The newly married.
The black folks.
Blacks.
The educated.
Mmm-hmm.
The bachelors.
Them, too.
Come on, now.
Scoot before the Cherokees get a vote.
Come on.
You're a gall-damned Italian thief!
Oh, Aunt Alice!
For once and for all, it is not.
I-talian!
It's Italian.
That's right.
You tell her, honey.
Come on, now, scoot.
Scoot.
Go on!
Bye-bye.
Bye, Alice.
Go on, get out!
I never worried about Alice Lambert.
Her face reading?
Tilt of her nose says she'd never win.
You did the right thing.
Come on, everybody, let's dance.
Hi, Ava.
Sweet Sue.
It's Ave.
I love this cake.
I gotta find out who the baker is because I want to have it for the renewal of my vows.
I got back together with Mike.
I didn't know that.
It happened around the time of your mental collapse.
He loves me.
And he's crazy about the boys, and well, I hate being alone.
I need to work off all this cake.
Mike, let's do the hustle!
What happened to your pink dress?
Um...
It was cutting off my circulation.
You gonna stay mad at me forever?
I'm not mad at you.
No?
If I were mad at you, it'd suggest I was angry.
And if I were angry, it would mean I had feelings for you, and you're a reasonably nice person, but see?
No feelings.
For somebody who don't have any feelings, you sure talk about it a lot.
Aren't you the expert?
All I'm saying is I don't believe you.
It's your choice.
It means that much to you, to hang on to your judgment of me?
I must scare you.
Uh...
Oh, no, sir.
Then you'll come with me?
Where?
I've got something for you in my truck.
I bet you do.
Put your cake down.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
Put your cake down.
I'm busy.
Put your cake down.
Come on.
Come on.
Where in the world did you find this?
It was an ordeal.
Had to figure out how to spell it first.
Schilpario, A Life in the Mountains.
This is my father's hometown.
I special ordered it from Richmond.
I figured it'd be of some use to you when you go to Italy.
Thank you.
You're entirely welcome.
I owe you an apology-
For what?
I haven't been very nice to you.
Well, why is that?
I don't know.
I have an idea why.
Well, why do you think?
You don't want anybody or anything to keep you here.
That's partly right.
I'm also just being honest with myself.
I've given everything I have to this place, and it hasn't made me happy.
You think happiness is out there somewhere?
If I didn't believe that, I wouldn't be going.
Do you think you'll ever come back?
You know 'm the Outdoor Drama when Jack Hale, the mining engineer, sends June Tolliver, the poor girl from the mountains, off to be educated?
She goes to the Bluegrass of Kentucky and she learns how to talk, and culture, manners, how to dress.
And then when she comes home, she doesn't fit in anymore.
I'm hoping that's what'll happen to me.
I want to see and do so much that it changes me.
Mmm-hmm.
And then I won't want to come back.
At least that's what I'm hoping.
Well, what if I told you that I wanted you to stay?
Long time ago you asked me if I was scared of anything and I didn't answer.
I knew even then what I was afraid of.
I'm afraid I'm gonna spend my whole life without you.
I better go back inside.
Thank you so much for the book.
Howdy.
Hey.
Looks different, doesn't it?
Mmm-hmm.
I hate goodbyes.
I'm gonna miss you, Spec.
I'm gonna miss you, too.
I've never been friends with a woman.
I didn't think it was possible.
But you changed that.
I could tell you whatever I was thinking.
And I just want you to know that I will treasure that.
And you.
Aw...
Have I arrived in time to see Spec Broadwater weep melancholy tears of sadness and regret?
You have not, fancy pants.
I've come to pick up a chair.
All right, well, I guess I will help.
Where does the rest of this stuff go?
Furniture's all going to Sacred Heart Church, and anything left in the kitchen to Reverend Mother's Food Pantry.
I'm taking this with me.
It suits you.
Ah, and then I'm gonna take you out for hot dogs at the Hob Knob, and if you're a really good girl, for some donuts at Cab's.
Can I have it frosted?
Yes, you may have it frosted.
And then you have to get a good night's sleep, because we have a very big day planned for your last day here in Big Stone Gap.
We don't have time for this.
No, no, come on.
Come on, your flight doesn't leave until tonight.
Just one more stop.
Besides, you just can't leave without saying goodbye to the Outdoor Drama.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's go.
Everybody, settle down now.
We've got an announcement to make.
Honey-O.
There's somebody we want you to meet.
Papa.
There's more, darling.
Uh-uh, I can't take more.
I know you can't, but we got it for you.
We found your mama's sister.
This is your Zia Maria Luisa.
Ave Maria!
Thank God I'm wearing my waterproof Great Lash.
How did you find me?
I was just fixing to come look for you.
I received a letter.
From, uh...
Jack MacChesney.
He told me about your mama and the kind of lady she became.
He told me about you, the kind of girl you were, and the kind of lady you became.
And he said that the one thing that could bring you peace
was to know your father.
He sent the tickets.
He made all the arrangements.
How did you do that, Jack MacChesney?
You're a coal miner, not a king.
I sold my truck.
You love that truck.
Yeah, but I've loved you since the sixth grade.
So Ave Maria and I got married.
We made a home and built a life.
We had two beautiful children.
I worked in the mines till they closed, and Ave Maria delivered medicine until the Jeep wore out.
We held on when times got bad, and didn't let go when they got worse.
Life was good in Big Stone Gap.
But it wasn't perfect.
Well, you know how that goes.
Life's only perfect in the movies.
(STEAM WHISTLE SOUNDING)
AVE MARIA:
When I was a girl and we drove past the coal mines, it looked like a story book to me.
It seemed an army of men was doing something so important it could change the world.
That's when Mama would say,
"Every time you light a lamp to read,"
"you can thank a coal miner."
I was born and raised in the hills of Virginia when coal was king.
(CROWD CHEERING)
Life was simple in Big Stone Gap.
You went to Zackie's for your jeans, you went to Gilley's for your engagement ring.
And you went to my family drugstore when you were sick.
On Friday nights you rooted for the Vikings, and after the game, you went for burgers at Carmine's to celebrate, because we never lost.
Every year we put on The TrailoftheLonesomePine , the story of a mountain girl and the mining engineer who loved her.
You either acted a part or played in the band or worked behind the scenes, like me.
One year was a lot like the last, and before I knew it, it was 1978 and I turned 40.
Almost overnight,
I was the old maid in Big Stone Gap.
It seemed like happiness was for other people.
Morning, beautiful.
I don't know why you're honking the horn,
I'm standing out here black as night, I know you can see me.
Oh, good, you got Miss Weston's stuff right for the first time.
Yeah, I'm gonna give you something else if you don't leave me alone.
(DOGS BARKING)
Morning, Nan. (CHUCKLES)
Cherry pie was just wonderful.
Thank you.
It was rhubarb.
Them last ones you brought over here blocked me up.
Doc Daugherty swears these won't.
You just need to take them with some buttermilk in your stomach.
I got coffee on.
Biscuits and gravy.
Well, I can't stay.
I've got two more hollers to hit.
Oh, come on.
One cup won't keep you.
(MUTTERS) Jeepers Christmas, Jack!
Put some clothes on.
Yes, ma'am.
Morning, Jack.
Morning.
You'll have to excuse my son.
He was out till all hours last night with that Sweet Sue Tinsley.
That ain't a girl built for heavy lifting.
Woman has a man around doesn't have to do a lot of heavy lifting.
Well, I don't know what he's thinking.
Sure you do.
Sweet Sue Tinsley?
Come on.
She's a catch.
Prettiest girl in high school.
She made a bikini in Home-Ec and it won the blue ribbon.
Modeled it in front of Assembly.
Brought half the crowd to their feet at least.
(SCOFFS) I'll bet.
Beat the heck out of my apron.
Well, she's a flaunter, all right.
And she's got a big mess over there with that divorce and all them kids.
You ever want you some young'uns?
No, it's not gonna happen for me.
It is never too late.
My own mamaw was an old maid, too.
Almost 43 when she had my daddy.
She had a baby one week, then done went into the change the next.
Anything can happen.
What are y'all whispering about?
Ooh, I got to scoot.
Eula Belcher's all seized up and in dire need of her muscle relaxers.
Oh...
See her out, Son.
All right.
Thank you very much and that's all right, I'll see myself out.
No, no.
Best not to argue with Mama.
(CHUCKLES)
Here, let me help you.
Here you go.
(EXCLAIMING) Easy.
(CHUCKLES) You have very soft hands for a coal miner.
No, I got calluses.
That's how I follow the seams in the rock to the coal.
Hey, hold on!
Come here, I want to show you something.
(BIRDS CHIRPING)
Like my new truck?
1978 Ford pickup.
Four-wheeler, fully loaded.
Right fancy.
Nobody ever accused me of being fancy.
It's a pickup, not a Caddy.
Hey.
You going to the party on opening night?
Of course I am.
Theodore's taking me.
Are you ever gonna marry him?
You been talking to Fleeta?
Just one of the girls, ain't you?
I always took you for the strong, silent type.
You ain't scared of them strays, are ya?
No.
Who are you afraid of?
Howdy, Mama!
Did you eat?
Oh, not a bite all day.
Oh, I pack up a dinner for you.
Who has got time to eat?
(CHUCKLING)
The whole town is a-flutter with our final dress rehearsal.
Oh, you know, I cast everybody from here to Keokee whether they have talent or are lacking.
(LAUGHS)
You choose them, they have talent.
I know this.
Oh, so, the box office.
You sell the tickets?
No idea.
Whole town's in the dang thing.
There's nobody left to set for it.
Johnny Wood, he made the announcement on the radio,
WCYB. (HOOTING)
Well, I have to say that the poster in the pharmacy window is gorgeous and we did manage to paper Scott, Dickenson and Lee Counties.
That'll bring 'em in some.
I know this. (SIGHS)
You're gonna get a good crowd.
I work you too hard.
You're exhausted.
You need to sleep.
Don't worry about me, carissima.
Dr. Daugherty said the new pills, they work.
I'm sewing the last seam on the last costume. (CHUCKLES)
(HONKING)
Ave, let's go!
And do not forget my costume!
(BOTH GASP)
Oh, Aspetta.
Theodore's costume.
Thank you.
"And I shall rise on the third day."
Come...
Ave, where are you?
Let's go!
You are the director!
You cannot be late!
Oh, aspetta!
Tayloe!
Tayloe's costume!
Say "break a leg," just like a professional.
Break a leg.
AVE MARIA:
I'm coming, I'm coming!
THEODORE:
Costume looks great, Mrs. Mulligan!
TAYLOE:
This is The Trail of the Lonesome Pine, and my name is June Tolliver.
I left here a poor mountain girl, and have returned...
I have returned...
A lady?
A lady.
I don't fit in.
All right, just stop.
My teeth hurt.
Tayloe, learn your lines!
All right.
Yes.
Everybody, thank you so very much!
Will you please leave your costumes on the rack?
Hey y'all!
We're officially sold out for opening night!
(ALL CHEERING)
Where's Spec?
Right here.
IVA LOU:
This is bigger than a four alarm fire!
I need you real bad, Spec.
We're full up!
Order another keg.
Consider it done, Iva Lou.
Long as I get the first dance.
(WHISTLES)
SPEC:
You're the sexiest librarian in four counties, Iva Lou!
(EXCLAIMS)
Okay, Sweet Sue, you're on.
Come down the aisle.
Up.
Up.
Up.
(CHUCKLES)
lam going over to Carmine's for a burger.
You want to come?
Uh, not right now.
I have to run lines with the star.
Uh, I know my lines.
Good job on the timing of that cue.
Thank you.
And I do suspect that little Penny Coomer has a crush on you.
CHILD:
You're it!
Appears she's already over me, ma'am.
Jack, honey!
(GRUNTS)
I swear, sometimes we make music like we belong in the Grand Ole Opry.
Hardly puts me in the mind of Minnie Pearl, you displaying that leotard.
Why, thank you.
Okay, Pearl.
I don't care if everybody goes home naked...
Ave.
I need you to come here.
You need to come with me.
You gotta get Duke McMillan.
I'm staying late.
He knows CPR.
Darling, it's not a Rescue Squad run.
It's your mama.
Come on.
AVE MARIA:
No one worries about you like your mother.
And when she's gone, the world seems unsafe.
You can't turn to her anymore and it changes your life forever.
Hey, Miss Ave.
You probably don't remember me, but my name's Bobby Dinsmore from over on Skeens Ridge.
Well, sure I do.
I used to play the sax in the band.
Mmm-hmm.
Your mama made me this here uniform, 'cause they didn't have one big enough to fit me at the factory.
I bet you nobody knew it was homemade.
Well, it still looks right nice on you, Mr. Bobby.
All of you look right pretty, as a matter of fact.
Since our almighty God has called our sister, Fiammetta Onicelli Mulligan from this life, to himself, we commit her body to the earth from which it came.
Give her eternal rest, O Lord, and may your light shine on her forever.
(SNIFFLES)
Don't cry, Fleets.
(SOBBING)
When are you gonna cry?
I can't.
Why would you put a rose on your daddy's grave after he treated you like such dirt?
Maybe he'll do something kind and look out for Mama when she gets there.
(HONKING)
I do not like that sign.
The N fell off.
My brother kept this building pristine.
You've let the place go to hell!
Why Aunt Alice, I can't believe you haven't heard.
In honor of Mommy's memory,
Mutual's has officially gone Italian.
From now on, everything around here is gonna end in a vowel.
My brother Fred'd be ashamed!
Sail on, Alice.
Alice, sail on.
Thank you for the pineapple upside down cake.
It was delicious.
I did not send it.
It was not mine.
Mine was a Texas sheet cake, which I hope you froze.
I did, right next to my emotions.
Well, you know, Alice Lambert wouldn't have a reason to mess with you if you had a husband.
You know, I know Theodore's a Yankee, but, hell, at this point, you just gotta take whatever you can get.
I like being the town spinster.
It has cachet, Fleeta.
Yeah, well, you can't hug cachet.
(TYPING)
SPEC:
Well, thanks for stopping by, Doug Kilgore.
You tell that peanut farmer that I say, "Hi."
Thank you, Spec.
You take care, now.
EARL:
Mr. Broadwater will see you now, Ave.
Tell your mama and them I said, "Hi." I will.
Come on in, darling.
Take a seat.
Yeah.
Ave, how long I been a lawyer?
Long time.
And what I learned is this.
When people die, that's when all the secrets come out.
(DOOR CREAKING)
Earl, shut the damn door!
I swear that boy hasn't got the sense that God gave a screwdriver.
Anyway-
A while back, your mama came in to see me about doing her will, which I did.
And when I was gonna notarize it, she added the letter.
I don't understand.
You will when you read it, darling.
You best take a deep breath.
(SIGHS)
EARL:
I'll send the rest of the files to you, Miss Ave.
(TIRES SCREECHING)
"...too ashamed and never told them about my angel girl.
Mama."
How did this happen?
She was already pregnant when she left Italy.
And she was too ashamed to tell her family.
Came and found work as a seamstress, so...
Fred Mulligan felt sorry for her and married her.
Which explains why he never liked me.
'Cause I'm not even his.
(SIGHS)
This is my father.
Well, this sure explains your nose.
(BOTH LAUGH)
Ave, he's pretty suave.
Yeah.
Very.
You gonna go find him?
Why would he want me?
No man ever did.
I do.
(BIRDS CHIRPING)
(HONKING)
NA LOU:
Hey!
Ave!
Pull over!
Pull over!
Wise County Bookmobile.
Next stop, Shawnee Avenue.
Wait!
Don't go!
I got two check-outs for you.
Don't go.
Okay.
This is my favorite book on Chinese face reading. (CHUCKLES)
No, no.
I've read the face of every man I've ever known.
It's never been wrong.
You really think face reading's true?
It never fails.
I gotta say.
I'm not one bit surprised you're out here crying, all tore up and all alone.
You got a perfect little cupid's bow on your lip, which means you are proud and private and romantic.
See?
(SCOFFS)
Yeah, but all that information is useless if you don't love.
Now, that's where old Charlotte Bronte comes in with her Jane Eyre.
Miss Bronté can write her a love scene.
"Yearning and longing."
"Longing and yearning."
Nothing will take your mind off your tragedy than a good romance.
I haven't seen this since I was a girl.
Yeah, well, it's time for a revisit.
And take notes, honey.
(WHISPERS) Please, take notes.
Call you later!
My book report, but I hate Moby Dick.
My gosh, I love those shoes.
May I borrow them for my barbecue tonight?
Why, thank you.
Bobby's gonna be there.
So I'm gonna pick up some lipstick for that, too.
Totally.
Hey, Miss Ave?
Got my prescription ready?
Not yet.
She's so slow.
I don't understand what takes her so long, right?
Hey, ladies!
Put that lipstick down.
And do not touch any more magazines, because our patrons like them untouched.
Virginal.
If prescriptions didn't take so long, we wouldn't read 'em, Fleeta.
FLEETA:
Don't make me call your mother.
It's Pearl Grimes.
Look at her!
She is the ugliest thing I have ever seen.
So sad.
Well, you know she's a mess.
I mean, that clothing.
You know it's from Goodwill.
Think about all the people that have worn that before, and she's putting it on her daughter...
Tayloe Slagle.
Your birth control pills are ready over at the counter.
Your birth control pills are ready.
Thank you so much for trading at Mutual's.
Hope to see you soon.
I can't believe...
Can you believe she just...
Let's go!
Come on, girls.
From now on
I'm getting my pills in Appalachia.
They're not very bright.
I'd rather be pretty and stupid like them than what I am.
Mmm, no, you wouldn't.
Pretty fades, honey.
Stupid, it's annoying.
They got talent, too.
They baton twirl.
It's not a talent one calls upon later in life.
Well, I ain't got no talent.
And I ain't good at nothing.
Mmm... (SIGHS)
You know, it's just Fleeta and me around here.
We could use a hand.
Me?
You want to give me a job?
What do you say?
We ain't got no car.
I mean, how am I gonna get here?
I run all over these hills, hon.
Wouldn't be nothing for me to pick you up.
You could start by tackling that big pile of junk sitting there, and take some of that out back for me?
That'd be a big help.
Okay.
Thanks. (SNIFFLES)
So, this is your idea of the new employee?
You know, she don't keep herself very nice.
You just don't like Melungeons.
No, I don't.
But she'll do.
IVA LOU:
This is the box office speaking.
We are sold out!
If you don't have a ticket, then you do not have a seat.
I repeat, if you don't have a ticket, then you do not have a seat.
I've asked you a dozen times, it is the penultimate moment in the play.
I mean, have you ever seen West Side Story?
It's like, if Chino died of an epileptic seizure.
What is supposed to happen is very simple.
Point the gun at me.
Thank you, Virgil.
No.
Wait a minute.
Is that a prop?
You know what?
Point it away.
It's supposed to be a shot and then blood.
But what we have here is a shot, no blood!
Okay, Mr. Tipton, let me tell you.
I'm gonna take this here tube and I'm gonna rig it right up your pants...
I can't act with a tube in my pants!
(GRUNTS) Oh, for crying out loud!
I am so sorry, honey.
Just go make sure that Sweet Sue has her underpants on.
Now, you listen to me!
These temper tantrums may have gotten you results at the Bucks County Playhouse, but around here we do peaceable on opening night.
We do peaceable on opening night because you cannot train amateurs to be professionals.
And let me tell you something.
At the Bucks County Playhouse, we had a prop master.
I had a prop master.
And then they added a night shift to the Quik Mart and he had to resign.
Naturally.
I am doing the best I can.
You could put a broom up my ass and I would sweep the floor at the same time.
Now, we will use two squibs.
If one doesn't go off, then the other one will.
Okay.
Sounds reasonable.
Excellent.
Michelangelo said, "Genius is eternal patience."
Another know-it-all Italian.
STAGE DIRECTOR:
Five minutes to curtain!
Final touches and places, everybody.
Places, all right, let's go.
Final touches!
Wait.
Someone's locked me out of my dressing room!
Okay.
Places, everyone!
Good job.
Music.
Mr. MacChesney just winked at you.
No, he didn't.
He's got something in his eye.
Yes, he did.
I saw him.
Well, look.
I believe I need a seat.
I believe you're drunk, sir.
That's my Jade East cologne.
Do you like it?
(SNIFFS)
(SIGHS)
Even if I did, we're sold out.
I didn't catch your name.
Lyle Makin.
How did you hear about our outdoor extravaganza?
Well, I came to see Jack Mac.
We grew up together.
Well, now I live up in Crackers Neck Holler.
Well, I should visit Crackers Neck often.
And Holler.
On... (CHUCKLES)
And on the third day
I shall rise from the ashes of regret
like a phoenix!
(GUN MISFIRES)
Oh, no!
Howard, shoot him again!
Shoot!
Shoot him again!
Like a phoenix!
Have a heart attack!
Have a heart attack!
Get struck by lightning!
(ALL LAUGHING)
Good job.
Everybody dance!
Ow!
Watch it, Sue!
(APPLAUSE)
(GUNSHOT)
You're too late!
NA LOU:
The opening night party is for cast and crew only.
Everyone else is welcome to use their two-for-one coupons at Carmine's.
Leave in an orderly fashion.
(LAUGHING)
(GRUNTS) Oh, my God.
You are a wildcat.
You know it.
Come to Ding Daddy!
Happy to!
Oh!
Ladies, meet Lyle Makin.
Hello, Lyle.
He got the last seat in the theater.
Really?
Mmm-hmm.
Then where was you setting?
On his lap.
Mmm-hmm.
LYLE:
Where can I get something to drink?
That way.
Ladies.
Iva Lou, I'll see you at the keg.
There's something to this one.
I think he wants more than a rendezvous at the High Knob with a fifth of Night Train and a sack of Cab's donuts.
And you got all that from setting on his lap?
No, ma'am.
Chinese face reading.
He's got the chin of an emperor.
(SNICKERS)
Iva Lou?
Hmm?
You don't need a book to learn what to do with a man.
Now, me and Krifflum, we are still having intimate relations.
Even though I'm in the middle of the change.
And I'll tell you something else.
This is an old toaster.
But when he plugs it in... (GRUNTS)
NELLIE:
What a magnificent opening night!
Give yourselves a hand!
(ALL CHEERING)
I have wonderful news.
In a few short weeks, Mr. John Warner, candidate for senator of Virginia, will be making a campaign stop in Big Stone Gap, with his movie star wife,
Elizabeth Taylor!
(ALL GASP AND APPLAUD)
My God!
We have to feed 'em and entertain 'em.
And if you'd like to help there are sign-up sheets for committees in the Tolliver House.
Theodore Tipton, you're in charge of the show!
Now I'm gonna turn the stage over to Sweet Sue Tinsley, the president-elect of The Foxes, our volunteer ushers.
(WHISTLING)
Probably gonna do a cartwheel.
Thank you, Nellie.
Ava?
Ava Marie?
As president of The Foxes, we would like to thank you for being such a good director.
Well, thank you.
Nobody hands out programs like The Foxes do.
MAN:
Hey, Ave.
It ain't good to drink alone!
MAN 2:
Who you gonna share that bottle with?
MAN 3:
Ave Maria needs a man.
Hey, hey!
Excuse me!
She has her own man.
(ALL CHEERING)
(CHUCKLES)
What just happened?
You just kissed me.
No, you kissed me.
Let's eat.
Something to eat?
Uh, no.
I'm not hungry.
I've got band practice.
And, um...
And with Elizabeth Taylor coming to town,
I'm gonna have to put on a doozy of a show, so... (CHUCKLES)
I'll call you later?
Yeah.
Okay.
AVE MARIA:
That oak leaf is a particularly good one.
There.
You do realize that every time you smash it like that, you rub all the glitter off, don't you?
And why would you order something that looks like...
I could've picked these up off the ground.
I like the idea of adding these going vertical like, 'cause I think for the close passerby, they're very interesting.
This is more of a sophisticated look.
Whatever you want.
I'm just gonna say,
"I'm so sorry I didn't know I was doing such a bad job."
I've been doing this windows for,
I don't know, since you was little.
Hey, Fleeta... (EXPLOSION)
That's the Wence Mine.
(SIREN WAILING)
SPEC:
Carmine, over here!
MAN:
Hey, get in there!
We need to get him oxygen!
It's okay, pal.
We're right here.
There you go.
That's a good one.
SPEC:
Everyone's accounted for.
Lucky day.
Could've been a lot worse.
Spec, show me that.
Don't wait on me, honey.
Leola's here checking on her cousin.
Okay.
I'll catch a ride with her.
Jack?
You worried about little old me?
You thought I bought the farm, didn't you?
All right.
I like this.
Can I give you a lift?
Uh... (SCOFFS) Don't be proud.
It's just a 1973 un-American 3-speed transmission.
Oh.
Thank you, ma'am.
Mind if we stop at Mutual's first?
I need a box of Clairo I so I can rinse these ma'am's out of my hair.
Well, I don't see any grays.
You haven't changed a bit since high school.
Is that a good thing?
I think so.
Take it from one who's changed.
You haven't changed at all.
Shoot.
Girls still after you.
Good at sports.
Kind to your mother.
Gary Cooper of Big Stone Gap.
Hey, you had your share of suitors.
Wayne Rutledge had a crush on you for years.
Wayne Junior's not one to be real proud of.
He's doing 7 to 10 for robbing his podiatrist 'cause his feet hurt.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
Yeah, Wayne.
I heard he's still got all his hair.
After 30 you've got to put that in the plus column.
SWEET SUE:
There you are!
Jack!
Hey, hey!
SWEET SUE:
Honey.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Lordy.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
She's such a fawner.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Son, I heard everything on the police radio.
You done good.
You saved a man.
Your daddy would be so proud of you.
You're a hero!
No, no.
Hi, Ava.
Sue!
It's Ave, okay?
Ave.
Not Ava, like Ava Gardner.
But Ave Maria, like the prayer.
You know, we went through school for 12 years together and you never once got my name right.
(ENGINE STARTS)
Well, law me.
Sorry.
Let's go.
THEODORE:
Peewee football team right here, junior baton twirlers here, and Liz Taylor lookalikes here.
Coca-Cola cake, 7-Up cake, or Betty Cline's blackberry cobbler?
Cobbler.
I think I have put together a show that's gonna top her entrance into Rome in Cleopatra.
I'm gonna use the outside of Fraley's Coach House... (SHOOING)
And turn it into downtown Rome.
We're going to have a choir and festoonery and Cleopatra, the majorette.
I think I forgot to get coffee.
How could you be out?
People always dropping off their grief pies.
Oh, here's some.
It may be old, but we'll do what we can.
Oh, my lord.
Iva Lou, these are in Italian.
I think these may be letters from my father to my mother.
It's bad luck to read other people's private correspondence.
Especially when that person just passed away.
Oh, read 'em.
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
(GASPS) What does it all mean?
Not that it matters.
Everything sounds better in Italian.
Keep going.
(SPEAKING ITALIAN)
Bliss.
Pure bliss.
Oh, If Lyle Makin could speak Italian,
I'd never let him out of my trailer.
Would you two please pay attention?
I'm under a lot of pressure here.
I've gotta be the Bob Fosse of Big Stone Gap in a parking lot.
IVA LOU:
Ave's life is important, too.
Elizabeth Taylor will come and go, but we're here forever.
All right, girls.
I'm going.
I cannot work in an environment of frivolity, when I have to dazzle the world's biggest movie star.
Oh, but the cobbler's not even thawed yet.
THEODORE:
I'm sure there's plenty more where that came from.
Bye.
Bye.
NA LOU:
I don't know what his problem is.
He's wound tighter than a tick.
Well, he's an artist.
He pours himself into his work.
He loves music and the theater and marching bands.
Sometimes I think he like them little soldiers more than he likes you.
How is it going in the romance department?
He wants more time.
Lordy mercy!
I never heard of a man who wanted to wait.
Go out on that truck, you pick a book.
Any book.
Read between the lines.
What does Chinese face reading say about Theodore?
His forehead says he's stubborn.
That book of yours have a follow-up, 'cause that I already know.
Tell me something new.
Honey-O.
People are talking.
You've been best friends with a man for years without getting married in this town.
That makes you a lot like Mount Vesuvius.
People are just standing around waiting for you to blow.
But there's more.
No, there's not.
I didn't want to pile on, but my Lyle's clerk in the court in Pennington Gap, and he told me Alice Lambert filed papers against you in Lee County.
But I want you know I didn't just sleep with him to get that information on your behalf.
That is so big of you, Iva Lou.
I like his mind.
I'm sure you do.
Now, get.
Love you.
Oh!
Are you okay?
Yeah!
I don't care what you say, Ave.
If there is the slightest chance that Elizabeth Taylor is gonna be riding right down here on Main Street, she might have to stop and get herself a diuretic.
She'll come in here and see all the signage.
That's what I want.
Where's that Cleopatra wig you called me about?
FLEETA:
It's in the box right there.
Ah!
Yes!
Fleeta!
Yes.
Where's the black hair dye?
In my pocket.
You getting the last box.
Oh!
But, I just want to warn you, when you wake up tomorrow morning, you still gonna look like you, except with really dark hair.
All my life I wanted to look like Elizabeth Taylor.
And now I will.
Charge it.
You gonna be in for a shocker when you see what you look like.
Okay.
I'll have to deal with this rat's nest later.
I am late for rehearsal.
Rome has to be built in a day.
Why would you feed into this lunacy?
We should make Liz Taylor makeup kits.
These women been watching Liz Taylor up on the silver screen all their lives.
Now they believe Liz Taylor's come here 'cause she wants to watch them.
Hey, Fleeta?
Get ready, babe, you're next.
For what?
I don't see any Diahann Carroll color up in here.
History tells us,
Cleopatra was a black woman.
(EXCLAIMS)
JACK:
Afternoon, Miss Fleeta.
FLEETA:
It's Sweet Sue Tinsley's boys!
Look, Jack, a clown!
Jared, that's not nice.
You apologize.
Sorry.
I need a tissue.
PEARL:
They're in the back, Miss Ave.
JARED:
Can I have some candy?
Now, you know candy's very bad for your teeth.
But it is very good for your stomach, so you go on and take as much as you want.
What do you say?
Thank you.
You're very welcome.
Come on, Jared.
That's compliments of me and the clown.
Jack Mac likes Ave Maria.
Girl, you know less about men than you do about cosmetics.
If Ave would just give him a chance, she could have him. (SNORTS)
Little girl,
Ave Maria don't stand a chance next to Sweet Sue.
Sweet Sue is a saber-toothed divorcee in need of cash.
And Jack Mac's got him a steady job.
He got no dependents.
And when his mama passes, he gonna get that house across the bridge.
And don't forget, since he was 18, he got that pension from the miners.
Now, when you look at a situation like this...
Mmm-hmm.
You realize that money in the bank means love in the heart.
NAN:
You sure been seeing a lot of that Sweet Sue lately.
Seems things are getting serious.
(SIGHS)
Son, have I been a good mother?
Yes, ma'am.
Good answer.
Why do you ask?
Something wrong?
This is one of them moments when I wish your daddy was alive.
Just say it, Ma.
(SIGHS)
I don't want you to marry Sweet Sue Tinsley.
I haven't taught you the difference between love and lust.
See, true love energizes you.
Lust and all them other kinds of love just exhausts you.
All right.
No, now listen to me.
I mean, clearly, I failed you.
Of course, anything and everything that goes wrong with children is always the mother's fault.
But let me embrace my failure.
Why don't you marry some nice girl instead of that hotsy-totsy flaunter?
I'll marry whomever I please, Mama.
Well, then explain this to me.
Explain what you're doing with your life.
Mama, look at me.
Everything's passed me by.
That's not true.
You're a good man.
I want what you and Daddy had.
When I was young, I had a handle on things.
I knew who I was and what I wanted.
But I work in the dark.
And I have for 22 years.
When I come out of that mine,
I don't want complications.
I just want simple.
Well, that is the word I'd use to describe Sweet Sue.
(CHUCKLES)
I know you don't like her, Mama.
But I love her boys, and she's nice to me.
Well, you told me.
So, if that's your choice,
Sweet Sue will never know my true feelings.
(SIGHS HEAVILY)
Can I fix you some supper?
No, ma'am, I already have plans.
Okay.
(HORN HONKS)
(KNOCKING)
I found the tissues.
You're too late.
I see that.
How about some apple butter?
Mama just put this up, wanted you to have some.
Oh, that's very kind.
Thank you.
Would you like to come in?
Yes, ma'am.
Well, how about I make you a deal?
Okay.
If you quit calling me "ma'am,"
I'll get you a beer. (CHUCKLES)
Deal.
I remember the first time I was in this house.
Daddy fixed the electric here, one summer.
I don't remember you being here.
Your mama made us red pepper sandwiches.
Yeah.
Um... (MUMBLING)
This talking about food's made me hungry.
You want something to eat?
Sure.
Don't believe I got that kind of time.
(BOTH LAUGH)
What made you want to go into the mines?
Well, I couldn't wait.
When I was a boy, my daddy used to tell me stories.
He used to describe the mine, and what it was like, how quiet it could be, how dark it was,
how if you left it set long enough, that black coal would become diamonds.
That seemed almost magical to me.
Do you get scared?
Sure do.
But you do it anyway.
I'd never do much of anything if I didn't do the thing I'm afraid of.
Well, look who's at Carmine's.
Evening, Earl.
There's a special on banana pudding tonight.
Ooh.
I highly recommend it.
Y'all have a good meal.
Well, (SIGHS) reckon you better give Sweet Sue a call before Earl does.
(SIGHS)
You think I'm a two-timer?
I broke up with Sue.
I guess I felt alone when I was with her.
What is this?
It's a bowl of soup with a coal miner.
JACK:
Oh, that's a milk glass moon.
You want to see it up close?
I would dearly love to.
You got us a rocket ship?
Oh, I got a better way.
Take this.
Your mama sewed a new lining in it for me a couple of years back.
She always used satin inside coats.
It was a signature.
These are the best two seats in this whole theater, seats 5 and 7, row G,
to see the moon.
You know your numbers and your letters?
Almost all.
Thanks, Miss Callahan.
She did a right good job with you.
(LAUGHING)
She tried, but I was distracted.
See, I was sitting next to this pretty Italian girl.
I always appreciated that you said my name right.
Well, that's because you matter to me.
Ave, I've got a good job.
(STUTTERING)
I'm in pretty good shape.
I mean, I eat too much sometimes and I drink beer, but my heart's good, and I'm strong.
I've got some money saved.
And I got a new truck.
And I think we should get married.
Are you serious?
You don't have to answer right away.
I don't want to just get married.
I'd like to have some fun.
I mean, heck, I thought I was fixing to.
We got here, I was like, "I'd like to make love to that man."
Well, that's good. (SIGHS)
Well, then you had to go and ruin it by asking me to marry you.
I mean, my hopes were high an hour ago.
Well, let's get 'em back up there then.
Come on.
Jack.
Well, you've been kind enough to tell me a little about yourself.
I'll tell you something about me.
Is that all right?
Yeah.
Well, I'd like to be kissed.
I'd like to be kissed like Rhett Butler, in fact, kissed Scarlett O'Hara while Atlanta was burning.
I'd like to be held the way Heathcliff embraces Catherine on the Moors.
I'd like a passion so explosive it could burn Thornfield Hall down.
I'd like a man to look at me with the whole world in his eyes,
and know exactly what to do with the rest of him to please me.
Not just an old house and a pack of stray dogs and a good pension and a new, old truck.
So, you can take your moon and your bowl of soup and your marriage proposal and shop 'em around to some other girl, 'cause it ain't me.
Good Lord.
Oh, come on.
Get in the front.
Ave, come on!
I'm not gonna ride through town with you in the back.
Please.
Fine.
Be that way.
(ENGINE STARTS)
JACK:
Oh!
Hey.
Are you all right?
Ah!
Look who's here!
Finally.
You're late!
Again!
That's enough from you.
On the road.
I want you to hit your marks and do not screw this up for me.
Now, get over there!
It's here.
That bus!
Everybody, come on, storm the Bastille!
(MARCHING BAND PLAYING)
Come on.
Everyone, get in place.
Cleopatra!
Cleopatra!
You need to bring it down just a touch, Earl.
Oh, dear.
I'm sorry.
Damn it, John.
This was supposed to be fried chicken, in and out.
Yes.
Let me have this.
Is everyone in place for the show?
Tayloe?
Maggie the Cat!
Maggie the Cat!
Here she comes.
Here she comes.
(SHUTTERS CLICKING) (CROWD CHEERING)
Oh!
Sorry, sorry.
Miss Taylor!
I want to be your next husband!
No, don't!
Miss Taylor, Miss Taylor, Johnny Wood, WCYB-TV.
You've been married 9, 12, 10 times.
Why so many husbands?
You should always take a chance on love.
(ALL (zooms)
Fried chicken, Miss Taylor?
(CRUNCHING)
(CHOKING)
Spit it out!
Where's Doc Miranda at?
Elizabeth Taylor's choking on a chicken!
Oh, my God!
JOHNNY WOOD:
Elizabeth Taylor's visit to Big Stone Gap, Virginia, ends not with a bang, but a choking.
While sampling the local fried chicken,
Liz Taylor swallowed bone and is being taken to Lonesome Pine Hospital.
This is Johnny Wood, live for WCYB-TV in Big Stone Gap, Virginia.
WOMAN:
Good luck.
Talk less.
At least you're not the biggest disaster of the night.
What do you say we go home, and I'll let you beat me at rummy.
That's the last thing in the world I want to do.
Have you seen Theodore?
He's despondent.
Honey-O, I got some news.
Marty Gilley from the jewelry store told me Jack Mac bought a ring.
One karat, two baguettes for Sweet Sue.
You look awful nice.
You gave Sweet Sue Tinsley a ring?
I know it seems sort of sudden.
Sudden?
I'd call that lickety-split.
What'd you do, get some out of a gumball machine that's adjustable, try it on every finger in town till somebody said yes?
Now you're just being unkind.
Unkind.
(SCOFFS)
Man of few words, it doesn't take many to find the right one.
I tried with you!
Tried?
Like tried, like what?
On a job?
I'm a coal miner.
That's a lot easier work than you.
Can I ask you something?
Mmm-hmm.
Are you happy?
Darlin', happiness is a myth.
I got married when I was 15-years-old.
I got me five kids.
One a bigger disappointment than the next.
My grand kids ain't much better, neither.
'Course when you plant corn, you get corn.
If you could live your life over, what would you do different?
I'd marry me Twyla Johnson instead of the wife I got.
Twyla was the one that got away.
We all got one, you know.
You know.
That person that we ought to be with, we know we ought to be with, but circumstances have a way of
working out where you get sidetracked and end up settling.
Do you ever see Twyla?
We do have lunch every Tuesday.
My Tuesdays are content.
One out of seven days, (SIGHS)
I live the dream.
What you gonna do with yourself, girl?
Come here.
Come on here with Spec.
Give him a big hug.
Mmm!
We don't want no trouble, Ava.
What are you doing here?
This is my family home.
I want you to leave.
The truth has come out.
Now I know your mama done come clean with you.
You ain't our kin.
You never been blood.
I know what you are.
And that's a bastard.
When I think what your mother done to my family, it almost killed my mama when Fred came home with a wop.
He married her out of pity, 'cause she was knocked up.
My brother done educated you, clothed you and fed you like you was his.
You lived like a princess here in my family home, with trips to Monticello and so forth, while I never done got as far as Roanoke.
I'll see you in court.
You give me my key.
Come on, Wayne.
We just want what's coming to us.
(GRUNTS)
AVE MARIA:
Can I have a grilled cheese sandwich, tapioca pudding and a coconut cake?
THEODORE:
Black coffee for me.
Thanks.
I'm sorry I left you stranded last night, Ave, but we need to talk.
Okay.
About what?
Well, I was gonna wait to tell you this, but, um...
I just got offered the band director job at the University of Tennessee.
Chattanooga, so don't get too excited.
(CHUCKLES)
That's amazing.
Well, what's gonna happen to us?
We can't do this anymore.
No, we can't, can we?
We can't go around pretending we're just...
We're like other people.
Yeah, exactly.
Oh, my God, it's exhausting.
It sure is.
Oh, Ave.
You don't want me.
I'm a bad bet.
I have quirks.
You know, I'm persnickety and I'm churlish.
I'm moody, cranky, impossible, I'm...
And you know I have a terrible background.
Half my family drinks, and the other half hit the people who drink.
Theodore, do you like men?
And there's that, too.
Hope y'all are hungry!
Don't forget the coconut cake.
Coming right up!
(SIGHS HEAVILY)
PEARL:
Did you see that Liz Taylor sent a check to the hospital to thank 'em for saving her life?
I did and I felt so bad for her.
But I tell you what, I voted for her husband.
First time I ever voted Republican.
And he won.
Which just goes to show you, every vote counts.
Hey, Miss Ave.
Do you need help with any of those...
She ain't in her right mind.
FLEETA:
I'm worried about Ave Maria.
Iva Lou says she ain't been sleeping, and I can see she ain't been eating.
She just don't look good.
(CLAMORING)
NAN:
Jack?
Bring down that last tree.
You have to put it in the front hall.
Now, Mary Beth, grab them balls.
MAN:
This is the best Christmas show ever, Mrs. MacChesney.
Ma'am?
WOMAN:
This show'll be spectacular.
Feeling all right?
Ave Maria, I almost gave up on you.
Hey, ladies.
Start stringing these extra lights.
Listen.
You gotta do something.
Sweet Sue is planning a New Year's Eve wedding to my son.
They're gonna get married right in front of that fireplace while the tree is still up.
Now, he is the marrying kind, and he will never leave her once that ring is on his finger.
He's just like his fool daddy.
You can love him or beat him.
But either way he'd stay.
Now, please help me give her the big heave-ho.
Do you hear me, Ave Maria?
NAN:
You're gonna miss your chance with my son.
(GASPS) Ave?
WOMAN:
Ave, are you okay?
NA LOU:
Doc, what's happened to her?
DOC DAUGHERTY:
This is what we call an old-fashioned nervous breakdown.
What, do we take her up to Lonesome Pine?
No, her vitals are normal.
There's no reason to take her to the hospital.
Then why's she laying there like a bag of rocks?
That's for her to figure out.
I'll come and check her in the morning.
Just let her sleep.
Might be a good idea if you don't smoke around her.
Okay.
There comes a time in every woman's life when she's gotta face her fear.
I know.
I know.
All right, whose time is it now?
It's mine.
It's my time.
Good.
Now.
A woman with a purpose is worth 10 men with the same, okay?
Now, I'm not gonna tell you exactly what to say to him, but I am gonna tell you how to say it, all right?
You're gonna march up to Jack MacChesney, and you're gonna say,
"I need to talk to you, sir."
And he's gonna hem and haw and "yep" and "nope" and look right past you, like the shower after the shift is more important than the information you need to relay.
But you are to ignore all of that.
All right?
All right.
Men are bad at communicating, but they actually have ears.
So you just need to state your piece, you know, get into that little brain of his, 'cause he's actually a pretty smart guy.
I happen to know that, 'cause he checked out Quo Vadis, from the Bookmobile and that there's a door stopper.
You just think of Ave Maria, and all she done for you.
And that'll fuel your ambition to tell him what's what.
Okay?
Okay,
All right now, scoot!
Get your books on the way back.
Mr. MacChesney.
Mr. MacChesney?
See you later, Mr. MacChesney.
We're gonna save you some water, Mr. MacChesney.
Please do.
Please do.
What is it, Pearl?
It's about Ave Maria.
She's still asleep.
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
She loves you.
She say something to you?
No, sir.
And she don't know it yet.
But according to the ancient art of Chinese face reading...
Oh, come on.
According to the ancient art of Chinese face reading, the bridge of her nose and yours match which makes you besotted, true lovers.
You handled her all wrong.
Pearl, I appreciate your interest, but you're wrong.
She don't want me.
She done told me herself. (SIGHS)
And if there's one thing I know about women, it's when they tell you something, they mean it.
Thank you.
No!
Not Ave Maria.
She buries her feelings.
Doc thinks that's why she had that nervous breakdown.
Well, what do you want me to do about it, Pearl?
Well, I don't know.
I was hoping you could think of something.
Go on, get on.
So?
I don't know, Miss Iva Lou.
He seemed awful angry.
Passion in the pit.
That's the good news!
Let's go.
(DOOR UNLOCKS)
FIAMMETTA: (WHISPERING) Ave Maria.
Ave Maria.
Carissima, Ave Maria.
By the time you read this, I will be gone.
Please know that of all the things I ever had to do, leaving you here without me is the most difficult.
High in the Italian Alps, you have a family.
Your father is there, and my sister.
I was too ashamed and never told them about you.
But you deserve every good thing in this life.
All the things I could not give you, for my own reasons.
AVE MARIA:
Papa!
(SHRIEKING)
She's up!
Good God almighty.
She's up!
Come here!
Ave?
She's awake!
What happened?
Fleeta, she's awake!
Ave!
(AVE MARIA SHUDDERS) it is so cold here.
Honey.
IVA LOU:
Here, bundle up.
You're back.
You done come out of your deep sleep.
Oh, Spec.
Spec, I'm leaving.
I'm going to Italy.
I'm going to Schilpario, way up in the Italian Alps.
I've been telling you for years to go on vacation.
No.
I saw my father in a dream.
And I have to go find him.
You know, you need to calm down a little bit.
Take a deep breath.
(LAUGHS)
I don't know what pills Doc Daugherty been giving her, but it's making that girl crazy.
SPEC:
Listen up, Ave.
Before you leave for Italy, we've gotta get everything out of your name.
Even that old Cadillac.
AVE MARIA:
All right, hand me the pen.
Howdy, Miss Grimes, you remember me?
Sure do, Miss Ave.
How's your soap coming?
Good, good.
I'll have my Pearl bring you some.
Well, if you'd let me, I'd love to sell some at Mutual's.
I think people'd like that.
That'd be right nice.
She home?
She out back.
Pearlie?
PEARL:
Coming, Mama!
She been trying any of that miraculous face cream on you?
Yes, ma'am.
I used to be pretty, 'fore I lost my teeth.
They say little things don't matter, but they matter if they your teeth.
You could get you some new teeth in town.
Someday, right, Mama?
Sure.
Can I have a word, Pearl?
Mama, can I go?
Yes, ma'am.
Do you happen to have a dollar?
Um, yeah, you just paid me.
I got 46.
Here, you need anymore?
Just the one'll do.
Okay.
Congratulations, dear.
You just bought yourself a drugstore.
Miss Ave, I don't understand.
Spec said I had to sell Mutual's or it'd be took from me.
So, I looked around and I thought,
"Who deserves a good turn?"
"Who knows not just what a customer needs"
"but what she secretly wants?"
"Who has just the right touch with that insecure lady,"
"who's worn red lipstick all her life and could be pushed to try the hot pink?"
"Who treats her mommy like the treasure she is?"
"Who knows everybody on those ridges and is willing to walk"
"to take them their medicine when I can't get there?"
You're the best person I know, Pearl.
And I hope you'll keep using that head of yours the way you have been because
that store will be enough to get you through college and make you a good life.
But, Miss Ave, what about you?
I'll tell you a secret.
An elegant guest knows when to leave the party.
Mama!
FLEETA:
Who is it?
Fleeta.
Well, I just want to make sure it was you, 'cause it is time to negotiate.
'Cause if I'm gonna have to work for this little girl, and a Melungeon at that,
I feel I should be, well, compensated for my duress.
You sure about this number?
Yes, ma'am.
Then they are gonna have to carry me outta here.
Thank you.
I want you to look after Pearl.
You know this business better than anybody.
Just teach her proper.
I will.
Happy?
I'm very happy-
I'm gonna buy Krifflum a horse.
Come on in.
NA LOU:
Wise County Bookmobile.
Next stop, Mutual's Pharmacy.
I have news!
Iva Lou!
Lyle Makin asked me to marry him and I said, "Yes!"
Oh, tra-la.
Tra-la, tra-la.
Will you be my maid of honor?
No.
Oh...
Not you.
Ave Maria.
Honey, I would love to stand with you.
Honey.
So, you're pregnant?
(PIPE ORGANS PLAYING)
Lyle, keep it together.
You wouldn't know about me and Iva Lou, now?
Yep-
Come on, you, it's time!
(SIGHS)
Oh, you look beautiful.
I hate wearing white.
Do I look washed out?
You don't.
You don't.
You're not exactly blushing, but you're, uh, ruddy.
I can't do this, Ave.
Hey-
Shoot.
Iva Lou, you been drinking?
Is he drunk?
Groom's drunk.
(JACK GRUNTING)
Ave!
MAN:
Hold him up, Jack.
Then the two shall be one.
Amen.
Hang on!
Don't make me go in there.
Hi, Miss Nellie.
Think pink!
Oh, how could we not?
Not yet, not yet!
I'm not ready!
No!
You okay, Lyle?
All right, darling.
Let's get you married.
(SIGHS)
(SCREAMING)
Lord have mercy.
Is anybody at this wedding sober?
Doesn't look like it.
Where is he?
Where is he?
He's right here.
No. (MUTTERING)
Preacher, I think we're ready.
AVE MARIA:
Let's do this, we got them.
Hurry!
I now pronounce you man and wife.
(CRYING)
(SCATTERED APPLAUSE)
You know, this was the dumbest wedding I've ever seen.
I mean, every...
People that old just ought to elope.
I heard it was touching.
Sure, it was touching, if you like wrestling.
Hey, Mama.
Hi, Miss Fleeta.
How you doing?
Mama, show Miss Fleeta.
What?
Let me see.
Oh, those look good, girl!
Those look good!
Well, now I'm seeing that being pretty has its benefits.
That's right. 'Cause you know, every woman's beautiful.
Now, some is prettier than others.
But all women are beautiful.
Hey.
Would you care to dance?
Um...
Well, I think I bruised my hip in the fall and in these shoes my feet are a couple of bloody stumps.
So, no thank you.
You want a bag of ice?
ALICE:
Where is she?
Where is she?
Where is she?
I'm right here, Aunt Alice.
You may think you won, but you ain't, Ava Marie.
You are not gonna ruin this wedding reception, Aunt Alice.
It ain't like anybody's gonna remember it anyway.
You gave my brother's pharmacy to Pearl Grimes.
I sure did.
That belongs to me and my family.
Not anymore.
Well, that may be gone.
But I want this house back, and I'm gonna get it.
Oh, Aunt Alice.
You're just awful.
You're about to ruin my surprise.
Pearl!
Get in here, hon.
It would not be right for you to own a business in town and have to tote yourself all the way back and forth from Insko.
And I don't want you to be away from your mommy that much.
This house is yours.
(CROWD EXCLAIMS)
Oh, my God!
Miss Ave?
You giving us the house?
Oh, I hope you live here in joy and peace.
(GASPS) (CHUCKLES)
You sweet little thing.
You done give my house to that Melungeon?
My mama's Melungeon.
That's right.
Mine is too.
I married a Melungeon.
I'm a Melungeon.
I'm a Melungeon, too.
I think it's time for you two to turn tail and leave.
You've done about insulted everybody here.
Including the Melungeons.
The newly married.
The newly married.
The black folks.
Blacks.
The educated.
Mmm-hmm.
The bachelors.
Them, too.
Come on, now.
Scoot before the Cherokees get a vote.
Come on.
You're a gall-damned Italian thief!
Oh, Aunt Alice!
For once and for all, it is not.
I-talian!
It's Italian.
That's right.
You tell her, honey.
Come on, now, scoot.
Scoot.
Go on!
Bye-bye.
Bye, Alice.
SPEC:
Go on, get out!
I never worried about Alice Lambert.
Her face reading?
Tilt of her nose says she'd never win.
You did the right thing.
WOMAN:
Come on, everybody, let's dance.
Hi, Ava.
Sweet Sue.
It's Ave.
I love this cake.
I gotta find out who the baker is because I want to have it for the renewal of my vows.
I got back together with Mike.
I didn't know that.
It happened around the time of your mental collapse.
He loves me.
And he's crazy about the boys, and well, I hate being alone.
I need to work off all this cake.
Mike, let's do the hustle!
What happened to your pink dress?
Um... (CHUCKLES) It was cutting off my circulation.
You gonna stay mad at me forever?
I'm not mad at you.
No?
If I were mad at you, it'd suggest I was angry.
And if I were angry, it would mean I had feelings for you, and you're a reasonably nice person, but see?
No feelings.
For somebody who don't have any feelings, you sure talk about it a lot.
Aren't you the expert?
All I'm saying is I don't believe you.
It's your choice.
It means that much to you, to hang on to your judgment of me?
I must scare you.
(MUFFLED) Uh...
Oh, no, sir.
Then you'll come with me?
Where?
I've got something for you in my truck.
I bet you do.
Put your cake down.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
Put your cake down.
I'm busy.
Put your cake down.
Come on.
(LAUGHING)
Come on.
Where in the world did you find this?
(LAUGHING)
It was an ordeal.
Had to figure out how to spell it first.
Schilpario, A Life in the Mountains.
This is my father's hometown.
I special ordered it from Richmond.
I figured it'd be of some use to you when you go to Italy.
Thank you.
You're entirely welcome.
I owe you an apology-
For what?
I haven't been very nice to you.
Well, why is that?
I don't know.
I have an idea why.
Well, why do you think?
You don't want anybody or anything to keep you here.
That's partly right.
I'm also just being honest with myself.
I've given everything I have to this place, and it hasn't made me happy.
You think happiness is out there somewhere?
If I didn't believe that, I wouldn't be going.
Do you think you'll ever come back?
You know 'm the Outdoor Drama when Jack Hale, the mining engineer, sends June Tolliver, the poor girl from the mountains, off to be educated?
She goes to the Bluegrass of Kentucky and she learns how to talk, and culture, manners, how to dress.
And then when she comes home, she doesn't fit in anymore.
I'm hoping that's what'll happen to me.
I want to see and do so much that it changes me.
Mmm-hmm.
And then I won't want to come back.
At least that's what I'm hoping.
(SIGHS)
Well, what if I told you that I wanted you to stay?
Long time ago you asked me if I was scared of anything and I didn't answer.
(SNIFFLES)
I knew even then what I was afraid of.
I'm afraid I'm gonna spend my whole life without you.
I better go back inside.
Thank you so much for the book.
(SIGHS)
Howdy.
Hey.
Looks different, doesn't it?
Mmm-hmm.
I hate goodbyes.
I'm gonna miss you, Spec.
I'm gonna miss you, too.
I've never been friends with a woman.
(SIGHS)
I didn't think it was possible.
But you changed that.
I could tell you whatever I was thinking.
And I just want you to know that I will treasure that.
And you.
Aw...
Have I arrived in time to see Spec Broadwater weep melancholy tears of sadness and regret?
You have not, fancy pants.
I've come to pick up a chair.
All right, well, I guess I will help.
Where does the rest of this stuff go?
Furniture's all going to Sacred Heart Church, and anything left in the kitchen to Reverend Mother's Food Pantry.
I'm taking this with me.
It suits you. (CHUCKLES)
Ah, and then I'm gonna take you out for hot dogs at the Hob Knob, and if you're a really good girl, for some donuts at Cab's.
Can I have it frosted?
Yes, you may have it frosted.
And then you have to get a good night's sleep, because we have a very big day planned for your last day here in Big Stone Gap.
AVE MARIA:
We don't have time for this.
THEODORE:
No, no, come on.
Come on, your flight doesn't leave until tonight.
Just one more stop.
Besides, you just can't leave without saying goodbye to the Outdoor Drama.
(ALL CHEERING)
Come on.
Come on.
Let's go.
Everybody, settle down now.
We've got an announcement to make.
Honey-O.
There's somebody we want you to meet.
(CHUCKLES)
Papa.
(GASPS)
(LAUGHING)
There's more, darling.
Uh-uh, I can't take more.
I know you can't, but we got it for you.
We found your mama's sister.
This is your Zia Maria Luisa.
Ave Maria!
(APPLAUSE)
Thank God I'm wearing my waterproof Great Lash.
How did you find me?
I was just fixing to come look for you.
I received a letter.
From, uh...
Jack MacChesney.
He told me about your mama and the kind of lady she became.
He told me about you, the kind of girl you were, and the kind of lady you became.
And he said that the one thing that could bring you peace
was to know your father.
(SUPPRESSING SOBS)
(LAUGHS)
He sent the tickets.
He made all the arrangements.
How did you do that, Jack MacChesney?
You're a coal miner, not a king.
I sold my truck.
You love that truck.
Yeah, but I've loved you since the sixth grade.
(ALL CHEERING)
(ZIA MARIA LUISA SINGING IN ITALIAN)
JACK:
So Ave Maria and I got married.
We made a home and built a life.
We had two beautiful children.
I worked in the mines till they closed, and Ave Maria delivered medicine until the Jeep wore out.
We held on when times got bad, and didn't let go when they got worse.
Life was good in Big Stone Gap.
But it wasn't perfect.
Well, you know how that goes.
Life's only perfect in the movies.
When I was a girl and we drove past the coal mines, it looked like a story book to me.
It seemed an army of men was doing something so important it could change the world.
That's when Mama would say,
"Every time you light a lamp to read,"
"you can thank a coal miner."
I was born and raised in the hills of Virginia when coal was king.
Life was simple in Big Stone Gap.
You went to Zackie's for your jeans, you went to Gilley's for your engagement ring.
And you went to my family drugstore when you were sick.
On Friday nights you rooted for the Vikings, and after the game, you went for burgers at Carmine's to celebrate, because we never lost.
Every year we put on The TrailoftheLonesomePine , the story of a mountain girl and the mining engineer who loved her.
You either acted a part or played in the band or worked behind the scenes, like me.
One year was a lot like the last, and before I knew it, it was 1978 and I turned 40.
Almost overnight,
I was the old maid in Big Stone Gap.
It seemed like happiness was for other people.
Morning, beautiful.
I don't know why you're honking the horn,
I'm standing out here black as night, I know you can see me.
Oh, good, you got Miss Weston's stuff right for the first time.
Yeah, I'm gonna give you something else if you don't leave me alone.
Morning, Nan.
Cherry pie was just wonderful.
Thank you.
It was rhubarb.
Them last ones you brought over here blocked me up.
Doc Daugherty swears these won't.
You just need to take them with some buttermilk in your stomach.
I got coffee on.
Biscuits and gravy.
Well, I can't stay.
I've got two more hollers to hit.
Oh, come on.
One cup won't keep you.
Jeepers Christmas, Jack!
Put some clothes on.
Yes, ma'am.
Morning, Jack.
Morning.
You'll have to excuse my son.
He was out till all hours last night with that Sweet Sue Tinsley.
That ain't a girl built for heavy lifting.
Woman has a man around doesn't have to do a lot of heavy lifting.
Well, I don't know what he's thinking.
Sure you do.
Sweet Sue Tinsley?
Come on.
She's a catch.
Prettiest girl in high school.
She made a bikini in Home-Ec and it won the blue ribbon.
Modeled it in front of Assembly.
Brought half the crowd to their feet at least.
I'll bet.
Beat the heck out of my apron.
Well, she's a flaunter, all right.
And she's got a big mess over there with that divorce and all them kids.
You ever want you some young'uns?
No, it's not gonna happen for me.
It is never too late.
My own mamaw was an old maid, too.
Almost 43 when she had my daddy.
She had a baby one week, then done went into the change the next.
Anything can happen.
What are y'all whispering about?
Ooh, I got to scoot.
Eula Belcher's all seized up and in dire need of her muscle relaxers.
Oh...
See her out, Son.
All right.
Thank you very much and that's all right, I'll see myself out.
No, no.
Best not to argue with Mama.
Here, let me help you.
Here you go.
Easy.
You have very soft hands for a coal miner.
No, I got calluses.
That's how I follow the seams in the rock to the coal.
Hey, hold on!
Come here, I want to show you something.
Like my new truck?
1978 Ford pickup.
Four-wheeler, fully loaded.
Right fancy.
Nobody ever accused me of being fancy.
It's a pickup, not a Caddy.
Hey.
You going to the party on opening night?
Of course I am.
Theodore's taking me.
Are you ever gonna marry him?
You been talking to Fleeta?
Just one of the girls, ain't you?
I always took you for the strong, silent type.
You ain't scared of them strays, are ya?
No.
Who are you afraid of?
Howdy, Mama!
Did you eat?
Oh, not a bite all day.
Oh, I pack up a dinner for you.
Who has got time to eat?
The whole town is a-flutter with our final dress rehearsal.
Oh, you know, I cast everybody from here to Keokee whether they have talent or are lacking.
You choose them, they have talent.
I know this.
Oh, so, the box office.
You sell the tickets?
No idea.
Whole town's in the dang thing.
There's nobody left to set for it.
Johnny Wood, he made the announcement on the radio,
WCYB.
Well, I have to say that the poster in the pharmacy window is gorgeous and we did manage to paper Scott, Dickenson and Lee Counties.
That'll bring 'em in some.
I know this.
You're gonna get a good crowd.
I work you too hard.
You're exhausted.
You need to sleep.
Don't worry about me, carissima.
Dr. Daugherty said the new pills, they work.
I'm sewing the last seam on the last costume.
Ave, let's go!
And do not forget my costume!
Oh, Aspetta.
Theodore's costume.
Thank you.
"And I shall rise on the third day."
Come...
Ave, where are you?
Let's go!
You are the director!
You cannot be late!
Oh, aspetta!
Tayloe!
Tayloe's costume!
Say "break a leg," just like a professional.
Break a leg.
I'm coming, I'm coming!
Costume looks great, Mrs. Mulligan!
This is The Trail of the Lonesome Pine, and my name is June Tolliver.
I left here a poor mountain girl, and have returned...
I have returned...
A lady?
A lady.
I don't fit in.
All right, just stop.
My teeth hurt.
Tayloe, learn your lines!
All right.
Yes.
Everybody, thank you so very much!
Will you please leave your costumes on the rack?
Hey y'all!
We're officially sold out for opening night!
Where's Spec?
Right here.
This is bigger than a four alarm fire!
I need you real bad, Spec.
We're full up!
Order another keg.
Consider it done, Iva Lou.
Long as I get the first dance.
You're the sexiest librarian in four counties, Iva Lou!
Okay, Sweet Sue, you're on.
Come down the aisle.
Up.
Up.
Up.
Lam going over to Carmine's for a burger.
You want to come?
Uh, not right now.
I have to run lines with the star.
Uh, I know my lines.
Good job on the timing of that cue.
Thank you.
And I do suspect that little Penny Coomer has a crush on you.
You're it!
Appears she's already over me, ma'am.
Jack, honey!
I swear, sometimes we make music like we belong in the Grand Ole Opry.
Hardly puts me in the mind of Minnie Pearl, you displaying that leotard.
Why, thank you.
Okay, Pearl.
I don't care if everybody goes home naked...
Ave.
I need you to come here.
You need to come with me.
You gotta get Duke McMillan.
I'm staying late.
He knows CPR.
Darling, it's not a Rescue Squad run.
It's your mama.
Come on.
No one worries about you like your mother.
And when she's gone, the world seems unsafe.
You can't turn to her anymore and it changes your life forever.
Hey, Miss Ave.
You probably don't remember me, but my name's Bobby Dinsmore from over on Skeens Ridge.
Well, sure I do.
I used to play the sax in the band.
Mmm-hmm.
Your mama made me this here uniform, 'cause they didn't have one big enough to fit me at the factory.
I bet you nobody knew it was homemade.
Well, it still looks right nice on you, Mr. Bobby.
All of you look right pretty, as a matter of fact.
Since our almighty God has called our sister, Fiammetta Onicelli Mulligan from this life, to himself, we commit her body to the earth from which it came.
Give her eternal rest, O Lord, and may your light shine on her forever.
Don't cry, Fleets.
When are you gonna cry?
I can't.
Why would you put a rose on your daddy's grave after he treated you like such dirt?
Maybe he'll do something kind and look out for Mama when she gets there.
I do not like that sign.
The N fell off.
My brother kept this building pristine.
You've let the place go to hell!
Why Aunt Alice, I can't believe you haven't heard.
In honor of Mommy's memory,
Mutual's has officially gone Italian.
From now on, everything around here is gonna end in a vowel.
My brother Fred'd be ashamed!
Sail on, Alice.
Alice, sail on.
Thank you for the pineapple upside down cake.
It was delicious.
I did not send it.
It was not mine.
Mine was a Texas sheet cake, which I hope you froze.
I did, right next to my emotions.
Well, you know, Alice Lambert wouldn't have a reason to mess with you if you had a husband.
You know, I know Theodore's a Yankee, but, hell, at this point, you just gotta take whatever you can get.
I like being the town spinster.
It has cachet, Fleeta.
Yeah, well, you can't hug cachet.
Well, thanks for stopping by, Doug Kilgore.
You tell that peanut farmer that I say, "Hi."
Thank you, Spec.
You take care, now.
Mr. Broadwater will see you now, Ave.
Tell your mama and them I said, "Hi." I will.
Come on in, darling.
Take a seat.
Yeah.
Ave, how long I been a lawyer?
Long time.
And what I learned is this.
When people die, that's when all the secrets come out.
Earl, shut the damn door!
I swear that boy hasn't got the sense that God gave a screwdriver.
Anyway-
A while back, your mama came in to see me about doing her will, which I did.
And when I was gonna notarize it, she added the letter.
I don't understand.
You will when you read it, darling.
You best take a deep breath.
I'll send the rest of the files to you, Miss Ave.
"...too ashamed and never told them about my angel girl.
Mama."
How did this happen?
She was already pregnant when she left Italy.
And she was too ashamed to tell her family.
Came and found work as a seamstress, so...
Fred Mulligan felt sorry for her and married her.
Which explains why he never liked me.
'Cause I'm not even his.
This is my father.
Well, this sure explains your nose.
Ave, he's pretty suave.
Yeah.
Very.
You gonna go find him?
Why would he want me?
No man ever did.
I do.
Hey!
Ave!
Pull over!
Pull over!
Wise County Bookmobile.
Next stop, Shawnee Avenue.
Wait!
Don't go!
I got two check-outs for you.
Don't go.
Okay.
This is my favorite book on Chinese face reading.
No, no.
I've read the face of every man I've ever known.
It's never been wrong.
You really think face reading's true?
It never fails.
I gotta say.
I'm not one bit surprised you're out here crying, all tore up and all alone.
You got a perfect little cupid's bow on your lip, which means you are proud and private and romantic.
See?
Yeah, but all that information is useless if you don't love.
Now, that's where old Charlotte Bronte comes in with her Jane Eyre.
Miss Bronté can write her a love scene.
"Yearning and longing."
"Longing and yearning."
Nothing will take your mind off your tragedy than a good romance.
I haven't seen this since I was a girl.
Yeah, well, it's time for a revisit.
And take notes, honey.
Please, take notes.
Call you later!
My book report, but I hate Moby Dick.
My gosh, I love those shoes.
May I borrow them for my barbecue tonight?
Why, thank you.
Bobby's gonna be there.
So I'm gonna pick up some lipstick for that, too.
Totally.
Hey, Miss Ave?
Got my prescription ready?
Not yet.
She's so slow.
I don't understand what takes her so long, right?
Hey, ladies!
Put that lipstick down.
And do not touch any more magazines, because our patrons like them untouched.
Virginal.
If prescriptions didn't take so long, we wouldn't read 'em, Fleeta.
Don't make me call your mother.
It's Pearl Grimes.
Look at her!
She is the ugliest thing I have ever seen.
So sad.
Well, you know she's a mess.
I mean, that clothing.
You know it's from Goodwill.
Think about all the people that have worn that before, and she's putting it on her daughter...
Tayloe Slagle.
Your birth control pills are ready over at the counter.
Your birth control pills are ready.
Thank you so much for trading at Mutual's.
Hope to see you soon.
I can't believe...
Can you believe she just...
Let's go!
Come on, girls.
From now on
I'm getting my pills in Appalachia.
They're not very bright.
I'd rather be pretty and stupid like them than what I am.
Mmm, no, you wouldn't.
Pretty fades, honey.
Stupid, it's annoying.
They got talent, too.
They baton twirl.
It's not a talent one calls upon later in life.
Well, I ain't got no talent.
And I ain't good at nothing.
Mmm...
You know, it's just Fleeta and me around here.
We could use a hand.
Me?
You want to give me a job?
What do you say?
We ain't got no car.
I mean, how am I gonna get here?
I run all over these hills, hon.
Wouldn't be nothing for me to pick you up.
You could start by tackling that big pile of junk sitting there, and take some of that out back for me?
That'd be a big help.
Okay.
Thanks.
So, this is your idea of the new employee?
You know, she don't keep herself very nice.
You just don't like Melungeons.
No, I don't.
But she'll do.
This is the box office speaking.
We are sold out!
If you don't have a ticket, then you do not have a seat.
I repeat, if you don't have a ticket, then you do not have a seat.
I've asked you a dozen times, it is the penultimate moment in the play.
I mean, have you ever seen West Side Story?
It's like, if Chino died of an epileptic seizure.
What is supposed to happen is very simple.
Point the gun at me.
Thank you, Virgil.
No.
Wait a minute.
Is that a prop?
You know what?
Point it away.
It's supposed to be a shot and then blood.
But what we have here is a shot, no blood!
Okay, Mr. Tipton, let me tell you.
I'm gonna take this here tube and I'm gonna rig it right up your pants...
I can't act with a tube in my pants!
Oh, for crying out loud!
I am so sorry, honey.
Just go make sure that Sweet Sue has her underpants on.
Now, you listen to me!
These temper tantrums may have gotten you results at the Bucks County Playhouse, but around here we do peaceable on opening night.
We do peaceable on opening night because you cannot train amateurs to be professionals.
And let me tell you something.
At the Bucks County Playhouse, we had a prop master.
I had a prop master.
And then they added a night shift to the Quik Mart and he had to resign.
Naturally.
I am doing the best I can.
You could put a broom up my ass and I would sweep the floor at the same time.
Now, we will use two squibs.
If one doesn't go off, then the other one will.
Okay.
Sounds reasonable.
Excellent.
Michelangelo said, "Genius is eternal patience."
Another know-it-all Italian.
Five minutes to curtain!
Final touches and places, everybody.
Places, all right, let's go.
Final touches!
Wait.
Someone's locked me out of my dressing room!
Okay.
Places, everyone!
Good job.
Music.
Mr. MacChesney just winked at you.
No, he didn't.
He's got something in his eye.
Yes, he did.
I saw him.
Well, look.
I believe I need a seat.
I believe you're drunk, sir.
That's my Jade East cologne.
Do you like it?
Even if I did, we're sold out.
I didn't catch your name.
Lyle Makin.
How did you hear about our outdoor extravaganza?
Well, I came to see Jack Mac.
We grew up together.
Well, now I live up in Crackers Neck Holler.
Well, I should visit Crackers Neck often.
And Holler.
On...
And on the third day
I shall rise from the ashes of regret
like a phoenix!
Oh, no!
Howard, shoot him again!
Shoot!
Shoot him again!
Like a phoenix!
Have a heart attack!
Have a heart attack!
Get struck by lightning!
Good job.
Everybody dance!
Ow!
Watch it, Sue!
You're too late!
The opening night party is for cast and crew only.
Everyone else is welcome to use their two-for-one coupons at Carmine's.
Leave in an orderly fashion.
Oh, my God.
You are a wildcat.
You know it.
Come to Ding Daddy!
Happy to!
Oh!
Ladies, meet Lyle Makin.
Hello, Lyle.
He got the last seat in the theater.
Really?
Mmm-hmm.
Then where was you setting?
On his lap.
Mmm-hmm.
Where can I get something to drink?
That way.
Ladies.
Iva Lou, I'll see you at the keg.
There's something to this one.
I think he wants more than a rendezvous at the High Knob with a fifth of Night Train and a sack of Cab's donuts.
And you got all that from setting on his lap?
No, ma'am.
Chinese face reading.
He's got the chin of an emperor.
Iva Lou?
Hmm?
You don't need a book to learn what to do with a man.
Now, me and Krifflum, we are still having intimate relations.
Even though I'm in the middle of the change.
And I'll tell you something else.
This is an old toaster.
But when he plugs it in...
What a magnificent opening night!
Give yourselves a hand!
I have wonderful news.
In a few short weeks, Mr. John Warner, candidate for senator of Virginia, will be making a campaign stop in Big Stone Gap, with his movie star wife,
Elizabeth Taylor!
My God!
We have to feed 'em and entertain 'em.
And if you'd like to help there are sign-up sheets for committees in the Tolliver House.
Theodore Tipton, you're in charge of the show!
Now I'm gonna turn the stage over to Sweet Sue Tinsley, the president-elect of The Foxes, our volunteer ushers.
Probably gonna do a cartwheel.
Thank you, Nellie.
Ava?
Ava Marie?
As president of The Foxes, we would like to thank you for being such a good director.
Well, thank you.
Nobody hands out programs like The Foxes do.
Hey, Ave.
It ain't good to drink alone!
Who you gonna share that bottle with?
Ave Maria needs a man.
Hey, hey!
Excuse me!
She has her own man.
What just happened?
You just kissed me.
No, you kissed me.
Let's eat.
Something to eat?
Uh, no.
I'm not hungry.
I've got band practice.
And, um...
And with Elizabeth Taylor coming to town,
I'm gonna have to put on a doozy of a show, so...
I'll call you later?
Yeah.
Okay.
That oak leaf is a particularly good one.
There.
You do realize that every time you smash it like that, you rub all the glitter off, don't you?
And why would you order something that looks like...
I could've picked these up off the ground.
I like the idea of adding these going vertical like, 'cause I think for the close passerby, they're very interesting.
This is more of a sophisticated look.
Whatever you want.
I'm just gonna say,
"I'm so sorry I didn't know I was doing such a bad job."
I've been doing this windows for,
I don't know, since you was little.
Hey, Fleeta...
That's the Wence Mine.
Carmine, over here!
Hey, get in there!
We need to get him oxygen!
It's okay, pal.
We're right here.
There you go.
That's a good one.
Everyone's accounted for.
Lucky day.
Could've been a lot worse.
Spec, show me that.
Don't wait on me, honey.
Leola's here checking on her cousin.
Okay.
I'll catch a ride with her.
Jack?
You worried about little old me?
You thought I bought the farm, didn't you?
All right.
I like this.
Can I give you a lift?
Uh...
Don't be proud.
It's just a 1973 un-American 3-speed transmission.
Oh.
Thank you, ma'am.
Mind if we stop at Mutual's first?
I need a box of Clairo I so I can rinse these ma'am's out of my hair.
Well, I don't see any grays.
You haven't changed a bit since high school.
Is that a good thing?
I think so.
Take it from one who's changed.
You haven't changed at all.
Shoot.
Girls still after you.
Good at sports.
Kind to your mother.
Gary Cooper of Big Stone Gap.
Hey, you had your share of suitors.
Wayne Rutledge had a crush on you for years.
Wayne Junior's not one to be real proud of.
He's doing 7 to 10 for robbing his podiatrist 'cause his feet hurt.
Yeah, Wayne.
I heard he's still got all his hair.
After 30 you've got to put that in the plus column.
There you are!
Jack!
Hey, hey!
Honey.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine.
Lordy.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
She's such a fawner.
Are you all right?
Yeah.
Son, I heard everything on the police radio.
You done good.
You saved a man.
Your daddy would be so proud of you.
You're a hero!
No, no.
Hi, Ava.
Sue!
It's Ave, okay?
Ave.
Not Ava, like Ava Gardner.
But Ave Maria, like the prayer.
You know, we went through school for 12 years together and you never once got my name right.
Well, law me.
Sorry.
Let's go.
Peewee football team right here, junior baton twirlers here, and Liz Taylor lookalikes here.
Coca-Cola cake, 7-Up cake, or Betty Cline's blackberry cobbler?
Cobbler.
I think I have put together a show that's gonna top her entrance into Rome in Cleopatra.
I'm gonna use the outside of Fraley's Coach House...
And turn it into downtown Rome.
We're going to have a choir and festoonery and Cleopatra, the majorette.
I think I forgot to get coffee.
How could you be out?
People always dropping off their grief pies.
Oh, here's some.
It may be old, but we'll do what we can.
Oh, my lord.
Iva Lou, these are in Italian.
I think these may be letters from my father to my mother.
It's bad luck to read other people's private correspondence.
Especially when that person just passed away.
Oh, read 'em.
What does it all mean?
Not that it matters.
Everything sounds better in Italian.
Keep going.
Bliss.
Pure bliss.
Oh, If Lyle Makin could speak Italian,
I'd never let him out of my trailer.
Would you two please pay attention?
I'm under a lot of pressure here.
I've gotta be the Bob Fosse of Big Stone Gap in a parking lot.
Ave's life is important, too.
Elizabeth Taylor will come and go, but we're here forever.
All right, girls.
I'm going.
I cannot work in an environment of frivolity, when I have to dazzle the world's biggest movie star.
Oh, but the cobbler's not even thawed yet.
I'm sure there's plenty more where that came from.
Bye.
Bye.
I don't know what his problem is.
He's wound tighter than a tick.
Well, he's an artist.
He pours himself into his work.
He loves music and the theater and marching bands.
Sometimes I think he like them little soldiers more than he likes you.
How is it going in the romance department?
He wants more time.
Lordy mercy!
I never heard of a man who wanted to wait.
Go out on that truck, you pick a book.
Any book.
Read between the lines.
What does Chinese face reading say about Theodore?
His forehead says he's stubborn.
That book of yours have a follow-up, 'cause that I already know.
Tell me something new.
Honey-O.
People are talking.
You've been best friends with a man for years without getting married in this town.
That makes you a lot like Mount Vesuvius.
People are just standing around waiting for you to blow.
But there's more.
No, there's not.
I didn't want to pile on, but my Lyle's clerk in the court in Pennington Gap, and he told me Alice Lambert filed papers against you in Lee County.
But I want you know I didn't just sleep with him to get that information on your behalf.
That is so big of you, Iva Lou.
I like his mind.
I'm sure you do.
Now, get.
Love you.
Oh!
Are you okay?
Yeah!
I don't care what you say, Ave.
If there is the slightest chance that Elizabeth Taylor is gonna be riding right down here on Main Street, she might have to stop and get herself a diuretic.
She'll come in here and see all the signage.
That's what I want.
Where's that Cleopatra wig you called me about?
It's in the box right there.
Ah!
Yes!
Fleeta!
Yes.
Where's the black hair dye?
In my pocket.
You getting the last box.
Oh!
But, I just want to warn you, when you wake up tomorrow morning, you still gonna look like you, except with really dark hair.
All my life I wanted to look like Elizabeth Taylor.
And now I will.
Charge it.
You gonna be in for a shocker when you see what you look like.
Okay.
I'll have to deal with this rat's nest later.
I am late for rehearsal.
Rome has to be built in a day.
Why would you feed into this lunacy?
We should make Liz Taylor makeup kits.
These women been watching Liz Taylor up on the silver screen all their lives.
Now they believe Liz Taylor's come here 'cause she wants to watch them.
Hey, Fleeta?
Get ready, babe, you're next.
For what?
I don't see any Diahann Carroll color up in here.
History tells us,
Cleopatra was a black woman.
Afternoon, Miss Fleeta.
It's Sweet Sue Tinsley's boys!
Look, Jack, a clown!
Jared, that's not nice.
You apologize.
Sorry.
I need a tissue.
They're in the back, Miss Ave.
Can I have some candy?
Now, you know candy's very bad for your teeth.
But it is very good for your stomach, so you go on and take as much as you want.
What do you say?
Thank you.
You're very welcome.
Come on, Jared.
That's compliments of me and the clown.
Jack Mac likes Ave Maria.
Girl, you know less about men than you do about cosmetics.
If Ave would just give him a chance, she could have him.
Little girl,
Ave Maria don't stand a chance next to Sweet Sue.
Sweet Sue is a saber-toothed divorcee in need of cash.
And Jack Mac's got him a steady job.
He got no dependents.
And when his mama passes, he gonna get that house across the bridge.
And don't forget, since he was 18, he got that pension from the miners.
Now, when you look at a situation like this...
Mmm-hmm.
You realize that money in the bank means love in the heart.
You sure been seeing a lot of that Sweet Sue lately.
Seems things are getting serious.
Son, have I been a good mother?
Yes, ma'am.
Good answer.
Why do you ask?
Something wrong?
This is one of them moments when I wish your daddy was alive.
Just say it, Ma.
I don't want you to marry Sweet Sue Tinsley.
I haven't taught you the difference between love and lust.
See, true love energizes you.
Lust and all them other kinds of love just exhausts you.
All right.
No, now listen to me.
I mean, clearly, I failed you.
Of course, anything and everything that goes wrong with children is always the mother's fault.
But let me embrace my failure.
Why don't you marry some nice girl instead of that hotsy-totsy flaunter?
I'll marry whomever I please, Mama.
Well, then explain this to me.
Explain what you're doing with your life.
Mama, look at me.
Everything's passed me by.
That's not true.
You're a good man.
I want what you and Daddy had.
When I was young, I had a handle on things.
I knew who I was and what I wanted.
But I work in the dark.
And I have for 22 years.
When I come out of that mine,
I don't want complications.
I just want simple.
Well, that is the word I'd use to describe Sweet Sue.
I know you don't like her, Mama.
But I love her boys, and she's nice to me.
Well, you told me.
So, if that's your choice,
Sweet Sue will never know my true feelings.
Can I fix you some supper?
No, ma'am, I already have plans.
Okay.
I found the tissues.
You're too late.
I see that.
How about some apple butter?
Mama just put this up, wanted you to have some.
Oh, that's very kind.
Thank you.
Would you like to come in?
Yes, ma'am.
Well, how about I make you a deal?
Okay.
If you quit calling me "ma'am,"
I'll get you a beer.
Deal.
I remember the first time I was in this house.
Daddy fixed the electric here, one summer.
I don't remember you being here.
Your mama made us red pepper sandwiches.
Yeah.
Um...
This talking about food's made me hungry.
You want something to eat?
Sure.
Don't believe I got that kind of time.
What made you want to go into the mines?
Well, I couldn't wait.
When I was a boy, my daddy used to tell me stories.
He used to describe the mine, and what it was like, how quiet it could be, how dark it was,
how if you left it set long enough, that black coal would become diamonds.
That seemed almost magical to me.
Do you get scared?
Sure do.
But you do it anyway.
I'd never do much of anything if I didn't do the thing I'm afraid of.
Well, look who's at Carmine's.
Evening, Earl.
There's a special on banana pudding tonight.
Ooh.
I highly recommend it.
Y'all have a good meal.
Well, reckon you better give Sweet Sue a call before Earl does.
You think I'm a two-timer?
I broke up with Sue.
I guess I felt alone when I was with her.
What is this?
It's a bowl of soup with a coal miner.
Oh, that's a milk glass moon.
You want to see it up close?
I would dearly love to.
You got us a rocket ship?
Oh, I got a better way.
Take this.
Your mama sewed a new lining in it for me a couple of years back.
She always used satin inside coats.
It was a signature.
These are the best two seats in this whole theater, seats 5 and 7, row G,
to see the moon.
You know your numbers and your letters?
Almost all.
Thanks, Miss Callahan.
She did a right good job with you.
She tried, but I was distracted.
See, I was sitting next to this pretty Italian girl.
I always appreciated that you said my name right.
Well, that's because you matter to me.
Ave, I've got a good job.
I'm in pretty good shape.
I mean, I eat too much sometimes and I drink beer, but my heart's good, and I'm strong.
I've got some money saved.
And I got a new truck.
And I think we should get married.
Are you serious?
You don't have to answer right away.
I don't want to just get married.
I'd like to have some fun.
I mean, heck, I thought I was fixing to.
We got here, I was like, "I'd like to make love to that man."
Well, that's good.
Well, then you had to go and ruin it by asking me to marry you.
I mean, my hopes were high an hour ago.
Well, let's get 'em back up there then.
Come on.
Jack.
Well, you've been kind enough to tell me a little about yourself.
I'll tell you something about me.
Is that all right?
Yeah.
Well, I'd like to be kissed.
I'd like to be kissed like Rhett Butler, in fact, kissed Scarlett O'Hara while Atlanta was burning.
I'd like to be held the way Heathcliff embraces Catherine on the Moors.
I'd like a passion so explosive it could burn Thornfield Hall down.
I'd like a man to look at me with the whole world in his eyes,
and know exactly what to do with the rest of him to please me.
Not just an old house and a pack of stray dogs and a good pension and a new, old truck.
So, you can take your moon and your bowl of soup and your marriage proposal and shop 'em around to some other girl, 'cause it ain't me.
Good Lord.
Oh, come on.
Get in the front.
Ave, come on!
I'm not gonna ride through town with you in the back.
Please.
Fine.
Be that way.
Oh!
Hey.
Are you all right?
Ah!
Look who's here!
Finally.
You're late!
Again!
That's enough from you.
On the road.
I want you to hit your marks and do not screw this up for me.
Now, get over there!
It's here.
That bus!
Everybody, come on, storm the Bastille!
Come on.
Everyone, get in place.
Cleopatra!
Cleopatra!
You need to bring it down just a touch, Earl.
Oh, dear.
I'm sorry.
Damn it, John.
This was supposed to be fried chicken, in and out.
Yes.
Let me have this.
Is everyone in place for the show?
Tayloe?
Maggie the Cat!
Maggie the Cat!
Here she comes.
Here she comes.
Oh!
Sorry, sorry.
Miss Taylor!
I want to be your next husband!
No, don't!
Miss Taylor, Miss Taylor, Johnny Wood, WCYB-TV.
You've been married 9, 12, 10 times.
Why so many husbands?
You should always take a chance on love.
Fried chicken, Miss Taylor?
Spit it out!
Where's Doc Miranda at?
Elizabeth Taylor's choking on a chicken!
Oh, my God!
Elizabeth Taylor's visit to Big Stone Gap, Virginia, ends not with a bang, but a choking.
While sampling the local fried chicken,
Liz Taylor swallowed bone and is being taken to Lonesome Pine Hospital.
This is Johnny Wood, live for WCYB-TV in Big Stone Gap, Virginia.
Good luck.
Talk less.
At least you're not the biggest disaster of the night.
What do you say we go home, and I'll let you beat me at rummy.
That's the last thing in the world I want to do.
Have you seen Theodore?
He's despondent.
Honey-O, I got some news.
Marty Gilley from the jewelry store told me Jack Mac bought a ring.
One karat, two baguettes for Sweet Sue.
You look awful nice.
You gave Sweet Sue Tinsley a ring?
I know it seems sort of sudden.
Sudden?
I'd call that lickety-split.
What'd you do, get some out of a gumball machine that's adjustable, try it on every finger in town till somebody said yes?
Now you're just being unkind.
Unkind.
Man of few words, it doesn't take many to find the right one.
I tried with you!
Tried?
Like tried, like what?
On a job?
I'm a coal miner.
That's a lot easier work than you.
Can I ask you something?
Mmm-hmm.
Are you happy?
Darlin', happiness is a myth.
I got married when I was 15-years-old.
I got me five kids.
One a bigger disappointment than the next.
My grand kids ain't much better, neither.
'Course when you plant corn, you get corn.
If you could live your life over, what would you do different?
I'd marry me Twyla Johnson instead of the wife I got.
Twyla was the one that got away.
We all got one, you know.
You know.
That person that we ought to be with, we know we ought to be with, but circumstances have a way of
working out where you get sidetracked and end up settling.
Do you ever see Twyla?
We do have lunch every Tuesday.
My Tuesdays are content.
One out of seven days,
I live the dream.
What you gonna do with yourself, girl?
Come here.
Come on here with Spec.
Give him a big hug.
Mmm!
We don't want no trouble, Ava.
What are you doing here?
This is my family home.
I want you to leave.
The truth has come out.
Now I know your mama done come clean with you.
You ain't our kin.
You never been blood.
I know what you are.
And that's a bastard.
When I think what your mother done to my family, it almost killed my mama when Fred came home with a wop.
He married her out of pity, 'cause she was knocked up.
My brother done educated you, clothed you and fed you like you was his.
You lived like a princess here in my family home, with trips to Monticello and so forth, while I never done got as far as Roanoke.
I'll see you in court.
You give me my key.
Come on, Wayne.
We just want what's coming to us.
Can I have a grilled cheese sandwich, tapioca pudding and a coconut cake?
Black coffee for me.
Thanks.
I'm sorry I left you stranded last night, Ave, but we need to talk.
Okay.
About what?
Well, I was gonna wait to tell you this, but, um...
I just got offered the band director job at the University of Tennessee.
Chattanooga, so don't get too excited.
That's amazing.
Well, what's gonna happen to us?
We can't do this anymore.
No, we can't, can we?
We can't go around pretending we're just...
We're like other people.
Yeah, exactly.
Oh, my God, it's exhausting.
It sure is.
Oh, Ave.
You don't want me.
I'm a bad bet.
I have quirks.
You know, I'm persnickety and I'm churlish.
I'm moody, cranky, impossible, I'm...
And you know I have a terrible background.
Half my family drinks, and the other half hit the people who drink.
Theodore, do you like men?
And there's that, too.
Hope y'all are hungry!
Don't forget the coconut cake.
Coming right up!
Did you see that Liz Taylor sent a check to the hospital to thank 'em for saving her life?
I did and I felt so bad for her.
But I tell you what, I voted for her husband.
First time I ever voted Republican.
And he won.
Which just goes to show you, every vote counts.
Hey, Miss Ave.
Do you need help with any of those...
She ain't in her right mind.
I'm worried about Ave Maria.
Iva Lou says she ain't been sleeping, and I can see she ain't been eating.
She just don't look good.
Jack?
Bring down that last tree.
You have to put it in the front hall.
Now, Mary Beth, grab them balls.
This is the best Christmas show ever, Mrs. MacChesney.
Ma'am?
This show'll be spectacular.
Feeling all right?
Ave Maria, I almost gave up on you.
Hey, ladies.
Start stringing these extra lights.
Listen.
You gotta do something.
Sweet Sue is planning a New Year's Eve wedding to my son.
They're gonna get married right in front of that fireplace while the tree is still up.
Now, he is the marrying kind, and he will never leave her once that ring is on his finger.
He's just like his fool daddy.
You can love him or beat him.
But either way he'd stay.
Now, please help me give her the big heave-ho.
Do you hear me, Ave Maria?
You're gonna miss your chance with my son.
Ave?
Ave, are you okay?
Doc, what's happened to her?
This is what we call an old-fashioned nervous breakdown.
What, do we take her up to Lonesome Pine?
No, her vitals are normal.
There's no reason to take her to the hospital.
Then why's she laying there like a bag of rocks?
That's for her to figure out.
I'll come and check her in the morning.
Just let her sleep.
Might be a good idea if you don't smoke around her.
Okay.
There comes a time in every woman's life when she's gotta face her fear.
I know.
I know.
All right, whose time is it now?
It's mine.
It's my time.
Good.
Now.
A woman with a purpose is worth 10 men with the same, okay?
Now, I'm not gonna tell you exactly what to say to him, but I am gonna tell you how to say it, all right?
You're gonna march up to Jack MacChesney, and you're gonna say,
"I need to talk to you, sir."
And he's gonna hem and haw and "yep" and "nope" and look right past you, like the shower after the shift is more important than the information you need to relay.
But you are to ignore all of that.
All right?
All right.
Men are bad at communicating, but they actually have ears.
So you just need to state your piece, you know, get into that little brain of his, 'cause he's actually a pretty smart guy.
I happen to know that, 'cause he checked out Quo Vadis, from the Bookmobile and that there's a door stopper.
You just think of Ave Maria, and all she done for you.
And that'll fuel your ambition to tell him what's what.
Okay?
Okay,
All right now, scoot!
Get your books on the way back.
Mr. MacChesney.
Mr. MacChesney?
See you later, Mr. MacChesney.
We're gonna save you some water, Mr. MacChesney.
Please do.
Please do.
What is it, Pearl?
It's about Ave Maria.
She's still asleep.
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.
She loves you.
She say something to you?
No, sir.
And she don't know it yet.
But according to the ancient art of Chinese face reading...
Oh, come on.
According to the ancient art of Chinese face reading, the bridge of her nose and yours match which makes you besotted, true lovers.
You handled her all wrong.
Pearl, I appreciate your interest, but you're wrong.
She don't want me.
She done told me herself.
And if there's one thing I know about women, it's when they tell you something, they mean it.
Thank you.
No!
Not Ave Maria.
She buries her feelings.
Doc thinks that's why she had that nervous breakdown.
Well, what do you want me to do about it, Pearl?
Well, I don't know.
I was hoping you could think of something.
Go on, get on.
So?
I don't know, Miss Iva Lou.
He seemed awful angry.
Passion in the pit.
That's the good news!
Let's go.
Ave Maria.
Ave Maria.
Carissima, Ave Maria.
By the time you read this, I will be gone.
Please know that of all the things I ever had to do, leaving you here without me is the most difficult.
High in the Italian Alps, you have a family.
Your father is there, and my sister.
I was too ashamed and never told them about you.
But you deserve every good thing in this life.
All the things I could not give you, for my own reasons.
Papa!
She's up!
Good God almighty.
She's up!
Come here!
Ave?
She's awake!
What happened?
Fleeta, she's awake!
Ave!
It is so cold here.
Honey.
Here, bundle up.
You're back.
You done come out of your deep sleep.
Oh, Spec.
Spec, I'm leaving.
I'm going to Italy.
I'm going to Schilpario, way up in the Italian Alps.
I've been telling you for years to go on vacation.
No.
I saw my father in a dream.
And I have to go find him.
You know, you need to calm down a little bit.
Take a deep breath.
I don't know what pills Doc Daugherty been giving her, but it's making that girl crazy.
Listen up, Ave.
Before you leave for Italy, we've gotta get everything out of your name.
Even that old Cadillac.
All right, hand me the pen.
Howdy, Miss Grimes, you remember me?
Sure do, Miss Ave.
How's your soap coming?
Good, good.
I'll have my Pearl bring you some.
Well, if you'd let me, I'd love to sell some at Mutual's.
I think people'd like that.
That'd be right nice.
She home?
She out back.
Coming, Mama!
She been trying any of that miraculous face cream on you?
Yes, ma'am.
I used to be pretty, 'fore I lost my teeth.
They say little things don't matter, but they matter if they your teeth.
You could get you some new teeth in town.
Someday, right, Mama?
Sure.
Can I have a word, Pearl?
Mama, can I go?
Yes, ma'am.
Do you happen to have a dollar?
Um, yeah, you just paid me.
I got 46.
Here, you need anymore?
Just the one'll do.
Okay.
Congratulations, dear.
You just bought yourself a drugstore.
Miss Ave, I don't understand.
Spec said I had to sell Mutual's or it'd be took from me.
So, I looked around and I thought,
"Who deserves a good turn?"
"Who knows not just what a customer needs"
"but what she secretly wants?"
"Who has just the right touch with that insecure lady,"
"who's worn red lipstick all her life and could be pushed to try the hot pink?"
"Who treats her mommy like the treasure she is?"
"Who knows everybody on those ridges and is willing to walk"
"to take them their medicine when I can't get there?"
You're the best person I know, Pearl.
And I hope you'll keep using that head of yours the way you have been because
that store will be enough to get you through college and make you a good life.
But, Miss Ave, what about you?
I'll tell you a secret.
An elegant guest knows when to leave the party.
Mama!
Who is it?
Fleeta.
Well, I just want to make sure it was you, 'cause it is time to negotiate.
'Cause if I'm gonna have to work for this little girl, and a Melungeon at that,
I feel I should be, well, compensated for my duress.
You sure about this number?
Yes, ma'am.
Then they are gonna have to carry me outta here.
Thank you.
I want you to look after Pearl.
You know this business better than anybody.
Just teach her proper.
I will.
Happy?
I'm very happy-
I'm gonna buy Krifflum a horse.
Come on in.
Wise County Bookmobile.
Next stop, Mutual's Pharmacy.
I have news!
Iva Lou!
Lyle Makin asked me to marry him and I said, "Yes!"
Oh, tra-la.
Tra-la, tra-la.
Will you be my maid of honor?
No.
Oh...
Not you.
Ave Maria.
Honey, I would love to stand with you.
Honey.
So, you're pregnant?
Lyle, keep it together.
You wouldn't know about me and Iva Lou, now?
Yep-
Come on, you, it's time!
Oh, you look beautiful.
I hate wearing white.
Do I look washed out?
You don't.
You don't.
You're not exactly blushing, but you're, uh, ruddy.
I can't do this, Ave.
Hey-
Shoot.
Iva Lou, you been drinking?
Is he drunk?
Groom's drunk.
Ave!
Hold him up, Jack.
Then the two shall be one.
Amen.
Hang on!
Don't make me go in there.
Hi, Miss Nellie.
Think pink!
Oh, how could we not?
Not yet, not yet!
I'm not ready!
No!
You okay, Lyle?
All right, darling.
Let's get you married.
Lord have mercy.
Is anybody at this wedding sober?
Doesn't look like it.
Where is he?
Where is he?
He's right here.
No.
Preacher, I think we're ready.
Let's do this, we got them.
Hurry!
I now pronounce you man and wife.
You know, this was the dumbest wedding I've ever seen.
I mean, every...
People that old just ought to elope.
I heard it was touching.
Sure, it was touching, if you like wrestling.
Hey, Mama.
Hi, Miss Fleeta.
How you doing?
Mama, show Miss Fleeta.
What?
Let me see.
Oh, those look good, girl!
Those look good!
Well, now I'm seeing that being pretty has its benefits.
That's right. 'Cause you know, every woman's beautiful.
Now, some is prettier than others.
But all women are beautiful.
Hey.
Would you care to dance?
Um...
Well, I think I bruised my hip in the fall and in these shoes my feet are a couple of bloody stumps.
So, no thank you.
You want a bag of ice?
Where is she?
Where is she?
Where is she?
I'm right here, Aunt Alice.
You may think you won, but you ain't, Ava Marie.
You are not gonna ruin this wedding reception, Aunt Alice.
It ain't like anybody's gonna remember it anyway.
You gave my brother's pharmacy to Pearl Grimes.
I sure did.
That belongs to me and my family.
Not anymore.
Well, that may be gone.
But I want this house back, and I'm gonna get it.
Oh, Aunt Alice.
You're just awful.
You're about to ruin my surprise.
Pearl!
Get in here, hon.
It would not be right for you to own a business in town and have to tote yourself all the way back and forth from Insko.
And I don't want you to be away from your mommy that much.
This house is yours.
Oh, my God!
Miss Ave?
You giving us the house?
Oh, I hope you live here in joy and peace.
You sweet little thing.
You done give my house to that Melungeon?
My mama's Melungeon.
That's right.
Mine is too.
I married a Melungeon.
I'm a Melungeon.
I'm a Melungeon, too.
I think it's time for you two to turn tail and leave.
You've done about insulted everybody here.
Including the Melungeons.
The newly married.
The newly married.
The black folks.
Blacks.
The educated.
Mmm-hmm.
The bachelors.
Them, too.
Come on, now.
Scoot before the Cherokees get a vote.
Come on.
You're a gall-damned Italian thief!
Oh, Aunt Alice!
For once and for all, it is not.
I-talian!
It's Italian.
That's right.
You tell her, honey.
Come on, now, scoot.
Scoot.
Go on!
Bye-bye.
Bye, Alice.
Go on, get out!
I never worried about Alice Lambert.
Her face reading?
Tilt of her nose says she'd never win.
You did the right thing.
Come on, everybody, let's dance.
Hi, Ava.
Sweet Sue.
It's Ave.
I love this cake.
I gotta find out who the baker is because I want to have it for the renewal of my vows.
I got back together with Mike.
I didn't know that.
It happened around the time of your mental collapse.
He loves me.
And he's crazy about the boys, and well, I hate being alone.
I need to work off all this cake.
Mike, let's do the hustle!
What happened to your pink dress?
Um...
It was cutting off my circulation.
You gonna stay mad at me forever?
I'm not mad at you.
No?
If I were mad at you, it'd suggest I was angry.
And if I were angry, it would mean I had feelings for you, and you're a reasonably nice person, but see?
No feelings.
For somebody who don't have any feelings, you sure talk about it a lot.
Aren't you the expert?
All I'm saying is I don't believe you.
It's your choice.
It means that much to you, to hang on to your judgment of me?
I must scare you.
Uh...
Oh, no, sir.
Then you'll come with me?
Where?
I've got something for you in my truck.
I bet you do.
Put your cake down.
Well, that's not gonna happen.
Put your cake down.
I'm busy.
Put your cake down.
Come on.
Come on.
Where in the world did you find this?
It was an ordeal.
Had to figure out how to spell it first.
Schilpario, A Life in the Mountains.
This is my father's hometown.
I special ordered it from Richmond.
I figured it'd be of some use to you when you go to Italy.
Thank you.
You're entirely welcome.
I owe you an apology-
For what?
I haven't been very nice to you.
Well, why is that?
I don't know.
I have an idea why.
Well, why do you think?
You don't want anybody or anything to keep you here.
That's partly right.
I'm also just being honest with myself.
I've given everything I have to this place, and it hasn't made me happy.
You think happiness is out there somewhere?
If I didn't believe that, I wouldn't be going.
Do you think you'll ever come back?
You know 'm the Outdoor Drama when Jack Hale, the mining engineer, sends June Tolliver, the poor girl from the mountains, off to be educated?
She goes to the Bluegrass of Kentucky and she learns how to talk, and culture, manners, how to dress.
And then when she comes home, she doesn't fit in anymore.
I'm hoping that's what'll happen to me.
I want to see and do so much that it changes me.
Mmm-hmm.
And then I won't want to come back.
At least that's what I'm hoping.
Well, what if I told you that I wanted you to stay?
Long time ago you asked me if I was scared of anything and I didn't answer.
I knew even then what I was afraid of.
I'm afraid I'm gonna spend my whole life without you.
I better go back inside.
Thank you so much for the book.
Howdy.
Hey.
Looks different, doesn't it?
Mmm-hmm.
I hate goodbyes.
I'm gonna miss you, Spec.
I'm gonna miss you, too.
I've never been friends with a woman.
I didn't think it was possible.
But you changed that.
I could tell you whatever I was thinking.
And I just want you to know that I will treasure that.
And you.
Aw...
Have I arrived in time to see Spec Broadwater weep melancholy tears of sadness and regret?
You have not, fancy pants.
I've come to pick up a chair.
All right, well, I guess I will help.
Where does the rest of this stuff go?
Furniture's all going to Sacred Heart Church, and anything left in the kitchen to Reverend Mother's Food Pantry.
I'm taking this with me.
It suits you.
Ah, and then I'm gonna take you out for hot dogs at the Hob Knob, and if you're a really good girl, for some donuts at Cab's.
Can I have it frosted?
Yes, you may have it frosted.
And then you have to get a good night's sleep, because we have a very big day planned for your last day here in Big Stone Gap.
We don't have time for this.
No, no, come on.
Come on, your flight doesn't leave until tonight.
Just one more stop.
Besides, you just can't leave without saying goodbye to the Outdoor Drama.
Come on.
Come on.
Let's go.
Everybody, settle down now.
We've got an announcement to make.
Honey-O.
There's somebody we want you to meet.
Papa.
There's more, darling.
Uh-uh, I can't take more.
I know you can't, but we got it for you.
We found your mama's sister.
This is your Zia Maria Luisa.
Ave Maria!
Thank God I'm wearing my waterproof Great Lash.
How did you find me?
I was just fixing to come look for you.
I received a letter.
From, uh...
Jack MacChesney.
He told me about your mama and the kind of lady she became.
He told me about you, the kind of girl you were, and the kind of lady you became.
And he said that the one thing that could bring you peace
was to know your father.
He sent the tickets.
He made all the arrangements.
How did you do that, Jack MacChesney?
You're a coal miner, not a king.
I sold my truck.
You love that truck.
Yeah, but I've loved you since the sixth grade.
So Ave Maria and I got married.
We made a home and built a life.
We had two beautiful children.
I worked in the mines till they closed, and Ave Maria delivered medicine until the Jeep wore out.
We held on when times got bad, and didn't let go when they got worse.
Life was good in Big Stone Gap.
But it wasn't perfect.
Well, you know how that goes.
Life's only perfect in the movies.
Did your sister come to see you, Amber?
Amber, answer the fucking question!
She's not gonna tell us anything.
Well, maybe it's because you're not asking the questions right.
What's the matter, sugar, do those chains hurt?
"Sugar"?
He's right.
- I ain't telling y'all shit.
- Hmm.
Maybe you're both asking the question wrong.
- May I?
- Go ahead.
Hello, Amber.
My name's Mr. Gus.
Mr. Northman and Ms. De Beaufort tell me your sister was paying you to remain in hiding.
Is that correct?
So then would you say money is a primary motivator for you?
Because, Amber, if we are correct in assuming that your sister's in possession of an antidote for this virus it could mean a lot of money for all of us.
Did Sarah come to see you?
Her name is not Sarah.
It's Noomi and she is a good person.
Yeah, a good person who created a virus that's killing off every single vampire on the planet.
Except now she's the cure.
Did you just say Sarah is the cure?
Now, your sister may have healed you but she is killing me.
She killed Jeremy.
You loved Jeremy.
- May I?
- She's all yours.
And Jeremy loved you.
You were happy together.
But then your sister Sarah or Noomi or whatever you want to call her she set fire to that happiness.
She killed him.
Stop it.
Time's wasting, Amber.
Tell us where she is.
I can't.
She saved me.
Well, stop trying to save her.
Fuck you.
She's my sister.
Huh.
Oh, no.
Fuck!
Eric.
No one's here.
You recognize this truck?
- Yes, it's Brian's.
- Brian?
Who's Brian?
Wade and Rocky's father, my ex-husband.
Well, they should be here, then.
Adilyn!
Wade, honey, if you're here, come on out.
With your hands up where I can see them.
You don't have to be so dramatic.
- They didn't break any law.
- Like hell, they didn't.
They're perverts and they're out here in violation of a parish-wide curfew.
Wade?
What--?
What are you doing?
Calling her.
Even if they don't wanna answer teenagers can have a Pavlovian response to a ringing cell phone.
Why is it happening so fast?
I don't know.
Is it because I'm fae?
I don't know.
It's mine.
Are you gonna get it?
I ain't even sure I can stand up.
- In that case, I'll get it.
- No, I'll get it.
Sookie, please.
I'm not dead yet.
- Hello?
- Vampire Bill, it's Andy.
Is Jessica around?
- Is that Andy?
- Passing you over.
Andy, shit, I am so sorry.
I completely forgot about y'all.
Don't worry about it, Jessica.
We ain't even at home.
Well, where are you?
Adilyn's had your blood, right?
Yeah.
But I-- Andy, I only did it because I--
So you'd feel her, right?
If she were in danger...
-...if anything bad happened to her?
- Uh...
Uh, yeah.
Well, have you felt her?
No, why?
You haven't?
Oh.
- Well, that's great.
That's great.
- Wait, Andy, what's happened?
Adilyn and Wade ran off together.
- Oh, my God.
Do you need my help?
- No, we're already out here looking for them.
Just do me a favor.
Promise me if you do feel her give me a call, or even if you hear from her.
- Yeah, of course.
But, Andy?
- Yeah?
If you find them, will you call me?
You got it, Red.
Well, the good news is they're alive.
But where the fuck do we look now?
Brian has a lake house.
Shit, that's it.
Let's go.
Where is this lake house, anyhow?
Half hour north of Oklahoma City.
- Oklahoma?
- I know.
When we get there, I'm gonna hug them, but then I'm gonna kill them.
Here we are.
Home, sweet home.
Oh, my God.
Wow.
- You like?
- This is amazing.
- Yeah, it's-
- It's cool.
- Wow.
Just breaks my heart that your parents don't support the love that you feel for each other.
Oh, and for what it's worth when I was your age, I used to fuck my brother too.
A lot.
Tsk.
This way.
Okay.
So there's a fully-stocked fridge with snacks.
Sling is over there, nipple clamps on the bedside table with some erotic oils and handcuffs.
Dildos and toys are on the wall.
Oh, I got that strap-on in Zanzibar in the 19th century.
It was one of the first of its kind.
- What's it--?
- What's it for?
You sweet, sweet boy.
Your imagination's a muscle.
Use it or lose it.
Now, I'm gonna go get some shut-eye.
You'll be safe here, and you can stay as long as you like.
- Are we cool?
- Totally.
Yeah.
- And, Violet?
- Hm?
Thank you for everything.
Yeah, thanks.
You don't have to thank me.
I love love, and watching love flourish is all the thanks I need.
Have fun fucking.
Bill.
This isn't happening.
Yeah, Sookie, it is.
In your book you mentioned an experimental treatment in India?
- It's years away.
- Gotta be something to slow this thing down.
Sookie, there's no cure.
I refuse to accept that.
Ah!
Oh, my God.
- I didn't mean to frighten you.
- Well, you did.
Matter of fact, you scared the bejesus out of me.
My apologies.
I know you've been through a great deal of suffering...
-...
I should've known better than to sneak up.
- Why did you, then?
Because, Arlene, it's still not safe for you to be out alone at night.
I came to see you home.
To offer you my protection.
Well, just so long as you don't get the wrong idea because, to be honest, Keith, this is silly.
I mean, what are you, 25?
I'm 515 years old.
Look, you're very attractive, but I am not a fangbanger, okay?
I know who I am.
And a human with a vampire is just wrong.
You know?
Did that feel wrong?
Yes.
What about that?
That feel wrong?
Huh?
Mm.
What are you doing?
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God, don't stop.
Oh, God.
Oh, my--
Oh, fuck.
You shouldn't have killed her.
She wasn't gonna cooperate anyway.
She was cooperating.
What do you want me to say, Pam?
I saw Sarah on that couch and I fucking lost it.
- Do you wanna die?
- I wanna kill Sarah Newlin.
- That's why we came back, remember?
- No.
- No?
- She's the antidote, Eric.
She can heal you.
This isn't about capture and kill anymore.
- This is about capture and--
- Capture and exploit.
You're a capitalist, yes?
I have a business proposition for you.
All right, we're listenin.
Together we track down Ms. Newlin we capture her and we synthesize her blood and we bottle it and distribute it worldwide as a product:
New Blood.
Catchy.
Yakonomo Corporation will retain controlling interest, of course but you will own 49 percent of the company.
I only see one problem.
How the hell are we supposed to find her?
In Japan, business and government work together.
Now, when Tokyo hears about Ms. Newlin's potential we will have immediate access to all of her intelligence assets.
We will find her.
You don't need a partner.
I'm sorry, was that a question?
My word is oak.
Why do you need us?
New Blood will eradicate Hepatitis V from the planet.
Now, the only problem is the public has lost its trust in Yakonomo Corp.
They'll want proof that New Blood works which means we'll need a vampire's testimonial for the advertising.
You want Eric to be your fucking spokesperson for your vampire Jenny Craig commercials?
Now, I ain't a homo but you have to admit he is a handsome devil.
No.
Do you know what 49 percent of a 3-and-a-half-billion- dollar-a-year company is?
I thought so.
Now, like I said, my word is oak.
What is your word worth?
- You have my word.
- Really?
I thought I had your word earlier...
-...and then you hauled off and killed the sister.
- You need me, right?
Well, then you're just gonna have to trust me.
I think I'm gonna stay up watch him sleep.
I have a better idea.
Why don't you climb in with him?
- You don't think that would be weird?
- No, honey, I really don't.
And you need your rest, so come on.
See?
It's not weird.
Sookie?
Yeah?
You said that you refuse to accept this.
But what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
But I meet people every day who say that they don't believe in miracles.
Sometimes they don't say it.
Sometimes they're just thinking it but when I hear that I just wanna shake them because how can you not believe in miracles and magic when they're happening all around us every single day?
There's a miracle out there just waiting for Bill.
I just have to go out there and find it.
I really hope you do.
- All right.
- It's okay.
Good night.
It's morning.
Of course it is.
When I marry, Father, it will be for love.
I'm sorry, son, but you're a man now.
It's time for you to take a wife.
You will marry Carolin Shelby, the neighbor's daughter.
They've just moved here.
I haven't met her.
- William--
- I was gonna go to California.
- I wanted to see the world.
- The Shelbys are a good family, it's important.
- Father, please--
- I'm dying, William.
You will marry Carolin Shelby not for me, but for your mother.
This way, you see, our lands will combine so she won't have to worry how to get by when I'm gone.
Very well, sir.
I will meet her.
She's just back from finishing school.
I'm sure you'll find her to your liking.
I have met her, William.
She's quite comely.
This is about the only place in town you can get a decent breakfast.
- I thought you said it was called Merlotte's.
- It is.
No, it's not.
Look.
Well, I'll be.
Huh.
- We got customers, Big John.
- And I'm ready for them.
Shit.
Welcome to Bellefleur's.
Thank you.
Hoyt?
Arlene.
Oh, my--
Oh, sugar, I am so sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
And I'm, uh--
I'm so sorry about Terry.
- Yeah, life is precious.
- Yes, it is.
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah.
Oh, Arlene this is my girlfriend, Brigette.
Nice to meet you, Ms. Bardot.
Oh, you are too sweet.
I'm really not.
Well, it's nice to meet you too.
I didn't know you took the place over.
Yeah, like five months ago, I think it was.
Yeah, business was booming until the H-vamps came.
Did y'all have any problems with them up in Alaska?
- Not yet.
- We've only been spared because it just about never gets dark where we live this time of year.
I never thought of that.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Brigette's super smart.
We met on the job.
She's a microbiologist.
- Hoyt, stop.
- But she don't like attention, though.
- Ooh.
- Listen, I am starving.
Oh, of course.
Let me get you some menus.
Sit wherever you want.
Can I get y'all something to drink while you decide?
Coffee for me.
Uh-
- Hot tea for Brigette.
And we're in a little bit of a hurry.
I gotta get to the police station to talk to Officer...
Stackhouse.
You mean Jason.
I didn't get a first name.
Just Stackhouse.
Yeah, Stackhouse.
Hoyt's here, Jason.
- What?
Hoyt?
He's where?
- At the BBG.
- He's acting like he doesn't even know you.
- Yeah, that's because he doesn't.
Listen, Arlene, do not say anything to him, all right?
- I'm on my way.
- Okay.
So...
-...should I use this on you?
- Uh...
How much does it say to use?
Um...
It doesn't.
All it says is that its chief ingredient is horny goat weed.
It "Invigorates the sensory nerves while restoring the adrenals and alleviating fatigue for a stress-reducing effect."
You wanna try something else, then?
Okay, just keep cool.
Be a man.
If she's into this stuff, you gotta do whatever it takes to please your woman, even if you ain't into this at all.
- Oh, thank God.
- What?
You're not into this.
- Are you?
- No.
Oh, my God.
Thank you.
No, thank you.
You have no idea how happy you just made me.
I thought you wanted to experiment.
No, and I thought that you wanted to on account of you being...
-...so much more experienced than me.
- Wait, what?
- What?
- Listen, I'm--
I'm not more experienced.
I mean our first time was my first time.
Mine too.
I really do love you, Wade Cleary.
I love you too.
That is Hoyt's girlfriend.
- Mr. Fortenberry?
- Ahem.
- Officer Stackhouse?
- Yes, sir.
I'm Hoyt Fortenberry.
This is my girlfriend.
Brigette.
It's nice to meet you too.
Though I'm sorry about the circumstances.
Well, uh to be honest, ahem, you know I try not to think about it.
It just all seems so unreal.
- Hmm.
- It'll probably feel more real once you go and see her.
Hmm?
Yeah, I don't know if I'm ready for all that yet, but...
You wanna join us for breakfast?
- Hmm?
- You wanna join us for breakfast?
Oh, you guys finish up.
I'll just...
-...be waiting over at the bar.
- No, don't be ridiculous.
No, please.
We insist.
It's okay.
Sorry about that.
Dr. Ludwig, thank you for coming on such short notice.
- Where's the patient?
- At his house.
I would've had you meet me there with him being a vampire, I thought this was safer.
Next time, save yourself some money and have me meet you where the patient is.
I fear nothing and no one, and I have no natural enemies.
Well, where is he?
Across the cemetery.
Ooh.
How very spooky.
A cemetery.
Shall we?
There she is.
- Where?
- Right over there with the Shelbys.
William.
- Stewart.
- Claire.
Margaret.
And you must be Caroline.
I have to admit you're not what I was expecting.
What were you expecting?
Well, your daddy.
Only younger...
-...and just as--
- Rotund?
No, I take after my mother.
The truth be told, Caroline, you're not quite what I was expecting either.
Oh?
And what were you expecting?
My father described you as "comely."
- Well, comely is a good thing.
- I know it is but that word is just so anachronistic...
-...that I suppose I thought you'd be--
- Old and dowdy?
Formerly pretty, yes.
You feel their eyes on us as aggressively as I do?
Now that you mention it, I can feel all eight of their eyes searing a hole into the back of my head.
Would you care to take a walk with me?
I would.
Mr. Compton.
Mr. Compton.
- Mr. Compton.
- Careful, he doesn't like to be woken.
Like I said, I fear nothing and no one.
Mr. Compton!
Remember me?
- Doctor?
- Ludwig.
Put your fangs away, son, and meet me in the parlor.
Mm-mm.
Nasty, nasty, nasty.
Congratulations, Mr. Compton.
They said it could not be done, but you have thoroughly grossed me out.
Can you help him?
How many days ago do you believe you were infected?
Don't look to her.
I'm the one that asked you the question.
I gotta say, Dr. Ludwig, I'm a little curious about your bedside manner.
Newsflash.
Sometimes monogamy means one thing to hopelessly romantic blond girls and something altogether different to their vampire lovers.
We are no longer lovers.
- Are you sure she knows that?
- He contracted the virus from me.
I was exposed through a cut in my arm.
He drank my blood and got sick pretty much right away.
I'm sorry, but that's not how this virus works.
Would it make any difference if Sookie was a halfling?
Half what?
- Half fae?
- Mm-hm.
A few weeks ago, I was called to the home of a sick vampire in Monroe.
He had a not dissimilarly accelerated rate of infection.
Went from stage one to stage three in 10 days.
I was perplexed until he revealed to me that his boyfriend was a Hep-V positive fairy.
He was no halfling, mind you.
He was the real deal.
And even so, he didn't look anywhere near as bad as Mr. Compton does.
Do you happen to know the name of your line?
- My line?
- Come on, missy.
Your fairy line.
- Your lineage.
- I don't know.
I don't know the name.
I guess I could ask Niall.
Niall Brigant?
Yeah, do you know him?
Are you related to Niall Brigant?
Yeah, he's my great-great-great- times-a-thousand-grandfather.
Why?
I'm so fucking out of here.
- Dr. Ludwig?
- I'll show myself out.
Goddamn it, Stackhouse.
Get your fucking eyes off her.
I should've been here.
Maybe I could've saved her.
At least just--
Just been here for her when it happened or something.
Hey.
You can't blame yourself.
And I'm sure if she were here right now, your mama would tell you the same thing.
No, she wouldn't.
If she were here right now, she'd lay it on thick.
God, what I wouldn't give for one more guilt trip.
- Hey.
- Huh?
Can you come in here, please?
Shit.
Hi.
Did you know Maxine?
Um-
- Yeah, yeah, a little.
Good.
I think he needs to talk to somebody who knew her.
Do you think you could just go and talk to him, maybe?
Yeah.
Thank you.
Uh...
I know it's hard, Mr. Fortenberry.
How'd it happen?
- Huh?
- How'd she die?
Um...
Well, you remember Vince McNeil?
- He's the orthodontist?
- Yeah.
Yeah, that's him.
Um...
Well, when the shit hit the fan at the BBG last week Mr. McNeil he got a bunch of the townsfolk all riled up and together they took the law into their own hands.
Was my mama one of them?
No, that--
No.
No, she was not.
She was one of the good folks.
Did you get the son of a bitch that did it to her?
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Yeah, I sure did.
Thank you, man.
Grandpa Niall?
You know I've been in a lot of situations lately.
I had plenty of good reasons to call on a fairy godfather but I didn't.
Until now because I like to think of myself as strong.
But I ain't this strong.
If you're listening, Grandpa Niall I need you to materialize right here right now.
Oh.
You know what?
Fuck this.
Jesus Christ.
- Niall.
- Hi.
How do you make that wonderful spaghetti?
This is so good.
- Can we go now?
- No.
Food first.
- One mustn't forget to nourish oneself.
- Please.
- I don't know how much time he has left.
- I understand but if this munchkin doctor doesn't know how to heal him what can I do?
You were watching?
I'm always watching you.
Do you know why she was so afraid of you, then?
We are royalty.
Dwarves have an innate fear of us.
Maybe because we killed so many of them in the past.
I just realized that if you're always watching did you know I was infecting Bill when he was feeding off of me?
I did.
Why would you let me do that?
- I don't like him.
- You don't have to like him.
You're doing something for me.
What I meant was I don't like him for you.
Grandpa Niall you say we're royalty but other than the vampire-killing light ball that I can only use once, by the way I can't think of a single fucking advantage in being what we are.
If you say that we're so fucking special I am asking you I'm begging you prove it.
Use some of your magic for me.
Fine, Sookie.
I'll try.
Watch him.
That's how you catch it.
There it is.
Hoo.
Hoo.
Hoo-hoo-hoo.
Jason?
Jason?
Over here.
- Oh.
Hey, Noomi.
- Oh, God, I'm so glad you're here.
I feel so alone.
Oh.
Well, we all die alone.
What?
You're gonna die tonight.
See, Eric's coming for you, and there ain't no escaping it.
But I don't wanna die.
Ha-ha-ha.
Well, that's just too fucking bad.
See, death comes for all of us and your number's up.
No.
You're not real.
Maybe not, but death is.
- Fuck off.
- Yeah, I'll be sure to do that, then.
I'll see you in hell when I get there.
There is no hell.
You just try to convince yourself of that.
You don't even know--
Hold it together, Noomi.
You are one with the universe.
Keep it together.
We've got her.
You can find another vampire.
You know how on the news you see these...
These places get wiped out by tornados but the people who live there are always vowing to rebuild on the exact same spot where tragedy took away everything they had?
I do.
Am I as crazy as they are?
I mean, is Nicole right?
Is this whole town crazy?
Because I love her and I wanna be a father to my baby girl but this ultimatum's got me.
Why can't I wrap my head around leaving this place?
I mean, at what point does the guy whose house keeps getting hit by a tornado call it a day, take his family, move someplace else?
I can't answer that for you, Sam.
Let me ask you a question.
Better pour me another one first.
I know you, Sam.
I know you better than I think you think I do.
And so I know that you've spent your whole life running away from things.
Bon Temps is the only place you actually stopped and stuck it out.
I ain't heard a question yet.
If you left do you think it would feel more like you were running from something or to somethin?
Let me put it another way.
If you stayed could you be happy here without them?
When you can answer the question, you'll know what to do.
Are you happy here, Arlene?
I mean, with everything that's going on and--
I fake it.
See, my hope is the more I fake it, the more I'll believe it until the happiness becomes real.
But, no, Sam, I ain't happy.
But there ain't a chance in hell I'm gonna stop trying to be.
Bon Temps is where my life is.
Everyone I know and love is here.
Adilyn, it's Daddy.
- Wade?
- Okay, here.
I think I got keys in here somewhere.
- What, he never changed the locks?
- I'm guessing no.
See, even though he hates me, he's as lazy as shit.
What'd I tell you?
Hey, kids, if y'all aren't wearing any clothes you better put some on because we're coming in.
Wade, honey?
Wade?
Adilyn?
Shit.
Where are they?
I mean, there's only so many places they could've gone.
Does Adilyn have any friends or family on her mama's side that she could've gone to?
I don't know, some kind of fairy hangout or something?
Andy?
Baby, you crying, baby?
Something about how peaceful this lake looks, I guess...
Oh.
Okay.
Hey, just take a breath.
Just breathe.
Oh, baby.
First you and then it's my baby girl, and I--
I'm trying to run around, keep y'all safe all the time.
- I can't do it no more, Holly.
I'm sorry.
- I know.
Oh, honey of course you can't.
You're just a person.
It was bad enough that I wasn't there that night they took you, but now this-
- Now this is all on me.
- No.
- Yeah, Adilyn ran away.
- And that's all because of me.
- Hey, hey, that is not true, okay?
And we're gonna get her back.
- I know it.
- How?
Listen, Andy, I know you love me for a lot of reasons and I know that my being a Wiccan ain't high up there on that list but do you believe I'm an intuitive person?
Yeah.
Then you listen to me, sheriff.
This story's gonna have a happy ending for us, okay?
I know it.
I promise it.
Are you kidding me?
Grandpa!
What's wrong?
We need to channel nature's memory here.
May I ask to what end?
Bill is inside the house.
How is channeling nature's memory gonna help?
History teaches us great lessons.
We need to look to it, find some answers.
Give me your hands.
Now, she will pull through, William.
Mr. Compton, please come in.
Congratulations, Mr. Compton.
Hi, sweetheart.
Hi, sweetie.
She's perfect.
Wow.
"Wow," what?
Didn't you thin that was amazing?
I guess?
Bill's wife gave birth.
So what?
"So what?"
Was I not clear before?
Because I thought I made myself perfectly clear when I said I was looking for a miracle.
- That was a miracle.
- Babies are born all the time.
That doesn't make it less miraculous.
There's magic in the ordinary, Sook.
There's magic in the things we can see.
Birth is a miracle.
Love is a miracle.
Death is a miracle.
Forgiveness is a miracle.
Especially if you can learn to forgive yourself.
Did you bring me here to Bill's house just to trick me?
No, sweet orphan.
I brought you here because I wanted to give you some advice.
There are some things that can be fixed with magic.
But your vampire friend is not one of them.
I'm sorry.
Thank you for the life lesson.
Can you go now, please?
Mama?
Arlene?
- Am I dreaming?
- No.
- Then how did you--?
- I felt your pain.
I came as soon as the sun went down.
The way Sookie always made it sound I thought vampires could only feel you when you were in danger.
Arlene, the pain that you're feeling that is dangerous.
Are you really 515 years old?
Yeah, I am.
Keith.
No.
You need to know.
I'm Hep-V positive.
And I know that you vampires are all super sexual and everything but we can't have sex.
Then let's just dance.
Oh.
- Oh, Violet.
- Hello, lovebirds.
- How'd you sleep?
- Oh, I slept like a baby.
Oh, I hope you don't mind, but we didn't wind up using any of your toys.
That's all right because we're gonna use them now.
- Uhn!
- Aah!
Fuck.
Jessica?
Pam?
Pam.
We overslept.
Goddamn it.
He fucking didn't.
Shall we go make some money?
I'm not gonna leave you.
I'm gonna stay with you till the very end, okay?
Okay.
I don't judge.
I don't judge lest--
Judge not, you lest judge.
I'm not alone.
I don't-- You have to make me be alone.
I'm here.
I felt my heart in this path and this light, the light of love, the light of God.
Please, I've led a good life.
Y'all are the only two men I've slept with so can you...
-...just go away?
- Ha.
Only two?
Oh, come on, Sarah.
Don't play me for a fool.
We both know that you fornicated with Jason Stackhouse in the balcony of the church that you and I built.
I'm no fool either, Sarah.
You lied to me.
You misled me.
I lost my head because of you.
Ha.
That's funny.
So did he.
Oh, my God.
Come on, Sarah.
You fornicated with him too, didn't you?
That makes four.
Why are you here?
I'm here because you're gonna die tonight, Sarah.
- Oh, God.
- I'm here to give you a choice between heaven and hell.
Because there's still time to save your soul.
There is no heaven, Noomi.
There is only the now and nothingness.
Nothingness?
What is nothingness?
I don't know what nothingness is.
- Which is why Christianity is a way better deal.
- No.
If you choose Jesus your meeting with the heavenly father which takes place in the risen Christ through the communion of the Holy Spirit awaits!
Follow the path, Noomi.
Die a Buddhist.
- Fuck the path, Sarah.
Die a Christian.
- Buddhist!
- Christian!
- Buddhist!
I choose neither.
I choose me.
I am the cure.
I am the messiah.
I choose myself.
Ha-ha-ha.
That's a bad fucking call right there, Sarah.
You never could stand on your own two feet.
What was that?
What, you need me to spell it out for you?
That's death coming for you.
Did your sister come to see you, Amber?
Amber, answer the fuckin' question!
She's not gonna tell us anything.
Well, maybe it's 'cause you're not asking the questions right.
What's the matter, sugar, do those chains hurt?
"Sugar"?
He's right.
I ain't telling' y'all shit.
Maybe you're both asking the question wrong.
- May I?
- Go ahead.
Hello, Amber.
My name's Mr. Gus.
Now, Mr. Northman and Ms. De Beaufort tell me that your sister was paying you to remain in hiding.
Is that correct?
So then would you say money is a primary motivator for you?
Because, Amber, if we are correct in assuming that your sister's in possession of an antidote for this virus, it could mean a lot of money for all of us.
Did Sarah come to see you?
Her name is not Sarah.
It's Noomi, and she is a good person.
Yeah, a good person who created a virus that's killing off every single vampire on the planet.
Except now she's the cure.
Did you just say Sarah is the cure?
Now, your sister may have healed you, but she is killing me.
She killed Jeremy.
You loved Jeremy.
- May I?
- She's all yours.
And Jeremy loved you.
You were happy together.
But then your sister--
Sarah or Noomi or whatever you want to call her-- she set fire to that happiness.
She killed him.
Stop it.
Time's wasting, Amber.
Tell us where she is.
I can't.
She saved me.
Well, stop trying to save her.
Fuck you!
She's my sister.
No.
Eric.

No one's here.
You recognize this truck?
Yes, it's Brian's.
Brian?
Who's Brian?
Wade and Rocky's father, my ex-husband.
Well, they should be here, then.
Adilyn!
Wade, honey, if you're here, come on out.
With your hands up where I can see them.
You don't have to be so dramatic.
- They didn't break any law.
- Like hell they didn't.
They're perverts and they're out here in violation of a parish-wide curfew.
Wade?
- What-- what are you doing?
- Calling her.
Even if they don't wanna answer, teenagers can have a Pavlovian response to a ringing cell phone.
Why is it happening so fast?
I don't know.
Is it because I'm fae?
I don't know.
It's mine.
-
- Are you gonna get it?
I ain't even sure I can stand up.
In that case, I'll get it.
No, I'll get it.
Sookie, please.
I'm not dead yet.
Hello?
Vampire Bill, it's Andy.
Is Jessica around?
Is that Andy?
Passing you over.
Andy, shit, I am so sorry.
I-
- I completely forgot about y'all.
Don't worry about it, Jessica.
We ain't even home.
Well, where are you?
Uh, Adilyn's had your blood, right?
Uh, yeah.
But I-
- Andy, I only did it because I--
So you'd feel her, right?
If-- if she were in danger, if anything bad happened to her?
Uh, yeah.
Well, have you felt her?
No, why?
You haven't?
Oh, well, that's great.
- Thank God.
- That's great.
Wait, Andy, what's happened?
Adilyn and Wade ran off together.
Oh, my God.
Do you need my help?
No, we're already out here looking for them.
Just, uh, do me a favor.
Promise me if you do feel her, give me a call, or even if you hear from her.
- Yeah, of course.
But, Andy?
- Yeah?
If you find them, will you call me?
You got it, Red.
Well, the good news is they're alive.
But where the fuck do we look now?
Brian has a lake house.
Shit, that's it.
Let's go.
Where is this lake house, anyhow?
Half hour north of Oklahoma City.
- Oklahoma?
- I know.
When we get there, I'm gonna hug them, but then I'm gonna kill them.
Here we are.
Home, sweet home.
Oh, my God.
- Wow.
- You like?
This is amazing.
Yeah, it's-- it's cool.
Wow.
Just breaks my heart that your parents don't support the love that you feel for each other.
Oh, and for what it's worth, when I was your age,
I used to fuck my brother, too.
A lot.
This way.
Okay.
So, there's a fully stocked fridge with snacks.
Sling is over there, nipple clamps on the bedside table with some erotic oils and handcuffs.
Dildos and toys are on the wall.
Oh, I got that strap-on in Zanzibar in the 19th century.
It was one of the first of its kind.
- What's--
- What's it for?
You sweet, sweet boy.
Your imagination's a muscle.
Use it or lose it.
Now I'm gonna go get some shut-eye.
You'll be safe here, and you can stay as long as you like.
- Are we cool?
- Totally.
Yeah.
- And, Violet?
- Hmm?
Thank you for everything.
Yeah, thanks.
Aw, you don't have to thank me.
I love love, and watching love flourish is all the thanks I need.
Have fun fucking.
Bill.
This isn't happening.
Yeah, Sookie, it is.
In your book you mentioned an experimental treatment in, um-- in India?
It's years away.
Gotta be something to slow this thing down.
Sookie, there's no cure.
I refuse to accept that.
Oh, my God!
I didn't mean to frighten you.
Well, you did.
Matter of fact, you scared the bejeezus outta me.
My apologies.
I know you've been through a great deal of suffering as of late and I should have known better than to sneak up on you.
Why did you, then?
Because, Arlene, it's still not safe for you to be out alone at night.
I came to see you home... to offer you my protection.
Well, just so long as you don't get the wrong idea, 'cause, to be honest, Keith, this is silly.
I mean, what are you, 25?
I'm 515 years old.
Look, you're very attractive, but I am not a fangbanger, okay?
I know who I am.
And a human with a vampire is just wrong.
You know?
Did that feel wrong?
Yes.
What about that?
That feel wrong?
Huh?
What are you doing?
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God, Oh, fu-uck.
You shouldn't have killed her.
She wasn't gonna cooperate anyway.
She was cooperating.
What do you want me to say, Pam?
I saw Sarah on that couch and I fucking lost it.
- Do you wanna die?
- I wanna kill Sarah Newlin.
That's why we came back, remember?
- No.
- No?
She's the antidote, Eric.
She can heal you.
This isn't about capture and kill anymore.
This is about capture and--
Capture and exploit.
You're a capitalist, yes?
I have a business proposition for you.
All right, we're listening.
Together we track down Miss Newlin, we capture her, and we synthesize her blood and we bottle it and distribute it worldwide as a product-
- New Blood.
Catchy.
Now, Yokonomo Corporation will retain controlling interest, of course, but you will own 49% of the company.
I only see one problem.
How the hell are we supposed to find her?
In Japan, business and government work together.
Now, when Tokyo hears about Miss Newlin's potential, we will have immediate access to all of her intelligence assets.
We will find her.
You don't need a partner.
I'm sorry, was that a question?
My word is oak.
Why do you need us?
New Blood will eradicate Hepatitis V from the planet.
Now, the only problem is the public has lost its trust in Yokonomo Corp.
They'll want proof that New Blood works, which means we'll need a vampire's testimonial for the advertising.
You want Eric to be your fuckin' spokesperson for your vampire Jenny Craig commercials?
Now, I ain't a homo, but you have to admit he is a handsome devil.
No.
Do you know what 49% of a three-and-a-half-billion- dollar-a-year company is?
I thought so.
Now, like I said, my word is oak.
What is your word worth?
- You have my word.
- Really?
'Cause I thought I had your word earlier tonight and then you hauled off and killed the sister.
You need me, right?
Well, then you're just gonna have to trust me.
I think I'm gonna stay up, watch him sleep.
I have a better idea.
Why don't you climb in with him?
You don't think that would be weird?
No, honey, I really don't.
And you need your rest, so, come on.
See?
It's not weird.
Sookie?
Yeah?
You said that you refuse to accept this.
But what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
But I meet people every day who say that they don't believe in miracles.
Sometimes they don't say it.
Sometimes they're just thinking it, but when I hear that, I just wanna shake them 'cause how can you not believe in miracles and magic when they're happening all around us every single day?
There's a miracle out there just waiting for Bill.
I just have to go out there and find it.
I really hope you do.
- All right.
- It's okay.
Good night.
It's morning.
'Course it is.
When I marry, Father, it will be for love.
I'm sorry, son, but you're a man now.
It's time for you to take a wife.
You will marry Caroline Shelby, the neighbor's daughter.
But they've only just moved here.
I haven't even met her yet.
- William--
- I was gonna go to California.
I wanted to see the world.
The Shelbys are a good family and it's important.
- Father, please--
- I'm dying, William.
You will marry Caroline Shelby, not for me, but for your mother.
This way, you see, our lands will combine so she won't have to worry how to get by when I'm gone.
Very well, sir.
I will meet her.
She's just back from finishing school.
I'm sure you'll find her to your liking.
I have met her, William.
She's quite comely.
This is about the only place in town you can get a decent breakfast.
I thought you said it was called Merlotte's.
It is.
No, it's not.
Look.
Well, I'll be.
Huh.
We got customers, Big John!
And I'm ready for them.
Shi-it.
Welcome to Bellefleur's.
Thank you.
Hoyt?
Arlene.
Oh, my-- oh, sugar, I am so sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
And I'm-- I'm so sorry about Terry.
- Yeah, life is precious.
- Yes, it is.
- Mm.
- Yeah.
Oh, Arlene, this is my girlfriend Brigette.
Nice to meet you, Miss Bardot.
Oh, you are too sweet.
I'm really not.
Well, it's nice to meet you, too.
I didn't know you took the place over.
Yeah, like five months ago, I think it was.
Yeah, business was booming until the H-vamps came.
Did y'all have any problems with them up in Alaska?
Not yet.
We've only been spared because it just about never gets dark where we live this time of year.
I never thought of that.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Brigette's super smart.
We met on the job.
She's a microbiologist.
- Hoyt, stop.
- But she don't like attention, though.
- Ooh.
- Listen, I am starving.
Oh, of course.
Let me get you some menus.
Sit wherever you want.
Can I get y'all something to drink while you decide?
Coffee for me, hot tea for Brigette, and we're in a little bit of a hurry.
I gotta get to the police station to talk to Officer...
Stackhouse.
You mean Jason.
I didn't get a first name.
Just Stackhouse.
Yeah, Stackhouse.
Hoyt's here, Jason.
- What?
Hoyt?
He's where?
- At the BBG.
And he's acting like he doesn't even know you.
Yeah, that's 'cause he doesn't.
Listen, Arlene-
- Arlene, do not say anything to him, all right?
- I'm on my way.
- Okay.
So... should I use this on you?
Uh, how much does it say to use?
Um... it doesn't.
All it says is that its chief ingredient is horny goat weed and that it "invigorates and alleviating fatigue for a stress-reducing effect."
You wanna try something else, then?
Okay, just keep cool.
Be a man.
If she's into this stuff, then you gotta do whatever it takes to please your woman, even if you ain't into this at all.
- Oh, thank God!
- What?
You're not into this.
- Are-- are you?
- No.
Oh, my God.
Thank you.
No, Wade, thank you.
You have no idea how happy you just made me.
I just thought you wanted to experiment or something.
No, and I thought that you wanted to on account of you being so much more experienced than me.
Wait, what?
- I--
- What?
Listen, I'm not-- I'm not more experienced.
I mean, our first time was my first time.
Mine, too.
I really do love you, Wade Cleary.
I love you, too.

Mr. Fortenberry?
Ahem, Officer Stackhouse?
Yes, sir.
I'm Hoyt Fortenberry.
This is my girlfriend.
Brigette.
It's nice to meet you, too.
Though I'm sorry about the circumstances.
Well, uh... to be honest, you know, I try not to think about it.
- It just all seems so unreal.
- Hmm.
It'll probably feel more real once you go and see her.
- Hmm?
- Yeah, I don't know if I'm--
I'm ready for all that yet, but... uh, you wanna join us for breakfast?
Hmm?
You wanna join us for breakfast?
Oh, uh, you guys finish up.
I'll just be waiting over at the bar.
Oh, no, don't be ridiculous.
No, please.
We insist.
-
- Oh...
- It's okay.
- Sorry about that.

Dr. Ludwig, thank you for coming on such short notice.
- Where's the patient?
- At his house.
I would've had you meet me there, except with him being a vampire and all,
I thought this was safer.
Next time, save yourself some money and have me meet you where the patient is.
I fear nothing and no one and I have no natural enemies.
Well, where is he?
Um, across the cemetery.
Ooh, how very spooky.
A cemetery.
Shall we?
There she is.
- Where?
- Right over there with the Shelbys.
- William.
- Stewart.
- Claire.
- Margaret.
And you must be Caroline.
I have to admit, you're not what I was expecting.
What were you expecting?
Well, your daddy, only younger and just as--
Rotund?
No, I take after my mother.
The truth be told, Caroline, you're not quite what I was expecting either.
Oh?
And what were you expecting?
My father described you as "comely."
Well, comely is a good thing.
I know it is, but that word is just so anachronistic that I suppose I thought you'd be--
Old and dowdy?
Formerly pretty, yes.
You feel their eyes on us as aggressively as I do?
Now that you mention it, I can feel all eight of their eyes searing a hole into the back of my head.
Would you care to take a walk with me?
I would.
Mr. Compton.
Mr. Compton!
- Mr. Compton!
- Careful, he doesn't like to be woken.
Like I said, I fear nothing and no one.
Mr. Compton!
Remember me?
- Doctor?
- Ludwig.
Put your fangs away, son, and meet me in the parlor.
Mm-mm.
Nasty, nasty, nasty.
Whew.
Congratulations, Mr. Compton.
They said it could not be done, but you have thoroughly grossed me out.
Can you help him?
How many days ago do you believe you were infected?
Don't look to her.
I'm the one that asked you the question.
I gotta say, Dr. Ludwig,
I'm a little curious about your bedside manner.
Newsflash-- sometimes monogamy means one thing to hopelessly romantic blonde girls and something altogether different to their vampire lovers.
We are no longer lovers.
Are you sure she knows that?
He contracted the virus from me.
I was exposed through a cut in my arm.
He drank my blood, and he got sick pretty much right away.
I'm sorry, but that's not how this virus works.
Would it make any difference if we told you that Sookie was a halfling?
- Half what?
Half fae?
- Mm-hmm.
A few weeks ago, I was called to the home of a sick vampire in Monroe.
He had a not dissimilarly accelerated rate of infection.
Went from stage one to stage three in 10 days.
I was perplexed until he revealed to me that his boyfriend is a Hep-V positive fairy.
He was no halfling, mind you.
He was the real deal.
And even so, he didn't look anywhere near as bad as Mr. Compton does.
Do you happen to know the name of your line?
- My line?
- Come on, missy.
Your fairy line, your lineage.
I don't know.
I don't know the name.
I guess I could ask Niall.
Niall Brigant?
Yeah, do you know him?
Are you related to Niall Brigant?
Yeah, he's my great-great- great-times-a-thousand-grandfather.
Why?
I'm so fuckin' outta here.
- Dr. Ludwig?
- I'll show myself out.
God damn it, Stackhouse.
Get your fuckin' eyes off her.
I should've been here.
Maybe I could've saved her or at least just-- just been here for her when it happened or something.
Hey, babe.
You can't blame yourself.
And I'm sure if she were here right now, your mama would tell you the same thing.
No, she wouldn't.
If she were here right now, she'd lay it on thick.
God, what I wouldn't give for one more guilt trip.
Huh?
Shit.
Hi.
Did you know Maxine?
Um, yeah-- yeah, a little.
Good.
I think he needs to talk to somebody who knew her.
Do you think you could just go and talk to him, maybe?
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
Uh...
I know it's hard, Mr. Fortenberry.
- How'd it happen?
- Huh?
How'd she die?
Um, well, you remember Vince McNeil?
- The orthodontist?
- Yeah.
Yeah, that's him.
Um... well, when the shit hit the fan at the BBG last week,
Mr. McNeil, he... got a bunch of the townsfolk all riled up, and together they took the law into their own hands.
Was my mama one of them?
No, that-- no.
No, she was not.
She-- she was one of the good folks.
Did you get the son of a bitch that did it to her?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Yeah, I sure did.
Thank you, man.
Grandpa Niall?
You know I've been in a lot of situations lately.
I had plenty of good reasons to call on a fairy godfather, but I didn't... until now... 'cause I like to think of myself as strong.
But I ain't this strong.
If you're listening, Grandpa Niall,
I need you to materialize right here, right now.
You know what?
Fuck this.
Jesus Christ.
Niall.
Hi.
How do you make that wonderful spaghetti?
This is so good.
- Can we go now?
- No.
Food first.
One mustn't forget to nourish oneself.
Please, I don't know how much time he has left.
I understand, but if this munchkin doctor doesn't know how to heal him, what can I do?
You were watching?
I'm always watching you.
Do you know why she was so afraid of you, then?
We are royalty.
Dwarves have an innate fear of us.
Maybe because we killed so many of them in the past.
I just realized that if you're always watching... did you know I was infecting Bill when he was feeding off of me?
I did.
Why would you let me do that?
I don't like him.
You don't have to like him.
You're doing something for me.
What I meant was I don't like him for you.
Grandpa Niall, you say we're royalty, but other than the vampire-killing light ball that I can only use once, by the way,
I can't think of a single fuckin' = advantage in being what we are.
If you say that we're so fuckin' special,
I am asking you...
I'm begging you... prove it.
Use some of your magic for me.
Fine, Sookie.
I'll try.

Oh, hey, Noomi.
Oh, God, I'm so glad you're here.
I feel so alone.
Huh.
Well, we all die alone.
What?
You're gonna die tonight.
See, Eric's coming for ya and there ain't no escaping it.
But I don't wanna die.
Well, that's just too fuckin' bad.
See, death comes for all of us, and your number's up.
No.
You're not real.
Maybe not, but death is.
Fuck off!
Yeah, I'll be sure to do that, then.
I'll see you in hell when I get there!
There is no hell.
You just try to convince yourself of that.
You don't even know--
Hold it together, Noomi.
You are one with the universe.
Keep it together.
Okay?
You know how on the news you see these-- these places get wiped out by tornados, but the people who live there are always vowing to rebuild on the exact same spot where tragedy took away everything they had?
I do.
Am I as crazy as they are?
I mean, is Nicole right?
Is this whole town crazy?
'Cause I love her and I wanna be a father to my baby girl, but... this ultimatum's got me.
Why can't I wrap my head around leaving this place?
I mean, at what point does the guy whose house keeps getting hit by a tornado call it a day, take his family, move someplace else?
I can't answer that for you, Sam.
Let me ask you a question.
Better pour me another one first.
I know you, Sam.
I know you better than I think you think I do, and so I know that you've spent your whole life running away from things.
Bon Temps's the only place you actually stopped and stuck it out.
I ain't heard a question yet.
If you left... do you think it would feel more like you were running from something or to something?
Let me put it another way.
If you stayed... could you be happy here without them?
When you can answer the question, you'll know what to do.
Are you happy here, Arlene?
I mean, with everything that's going on and--
I fake it.
See, my hope is the more I fake it, the more I'll believe it until the happiness becomes real.
But, no, Sam, I ain't happy.
But there ain't a chance in hell I'm gonna stop trying to be.
Bon Temps's where my life is.
Everyone I know and love is here.
Adilyn, it's Daddy.
- Wade?
- Okay, here.
I think I got keys in here somewhere.
What, he never changed the locks?
I'm guessing no.
See, even though he hates me, he's as lazy as shit.
What'd I tell you?
Hey, kids, if y'all aren't wearing any clothes, you better put some on 'cause we're coming in.
Wade, honey?
Wade?
Adilyn?
Shit.
Where are they?
I mean, there's only so many places they could've gone.
Does Adilyn have any friends or family on her mama's side that she could've gone to?
I don't know, some kind of fairy hangout or something?
Andy?
Baby, you crying, baby?
Something about how peaceful this lake looks, I guess, compared to this fucked-up reality we live in.
- I don't know.
- Oh, okay.
Hey, just take a breath.
Just breathe.
Oh, baby.
First you and then it's my baby girl, and I--
I'm trying to run around, keep y'all safe all the time.
I can't do it no more, Holly.
I'm sorry.
I know.
Oh, honey... of course you can't.
You're just a person.
It was bad enough that I wasn't there that night they took you, but now this-- now this is all on me.
- No.
- Yeah, Adilyn ran away, and that's all 'cause of me.
Hey, hey, that is not true, okay?
And we're gonna get her back.
I know it.
How?
Listen, Andy, I know you love me for a lot of reasons, and I know that my being a Wiccan ain't high up there on that list, but do you believe I'm an intuitive person?
Yeah.
Then you listen to me, Sheriff.
This story's gonna have a happy ending for us, okay?
I know it.
I promise it.
Are you kidding me?
Grandpa!
What's wrong?
We need to channel nature's memory here.
May I ask to what end?
Bill is inside the house.
How is channeling nature's memory gonna help?
History teaches us great lessons.
We need to look to it, find some answers.
Give me your hands.
Now, she will pull through, William.
-
- Mr. Compton, please come in.
Congratulations, Mr. Compton.
Hi, sweetheart.
She's perfect.
Wow.
Wow, what?
Didn't you think that was amazing?
I... guess?
Bill's wife gave birth.
So what?
"So what"?
Was I not clear before?
'Cause I thought I made myself perfectly clear when I said I was looking for a miracle.
- That was a miracle.
- Babies are born all the time.
That doesn't make it less miraculous.
There's magic in the ordinary, Sook.
There's magic in the things we can see.
Birth is a miracle.
Love is a miracle.
Death is a miracle.
Forgiveness is a miracle, especially if you can learn to forgive yourself.
Did you bring me here to Bill's house... just to trick me?
No, sweet orphan.
I brought you here because I wanted to give you some advice.
There are some things that can be fixed with magic.
But your vampire friend is not one of them.
I'm sorry.
Thank you for the life lesson.
Can you go now, please?

Oh, come on, Sarah.
Don't play me for a fool.
We both know that you fornicated with Jason Stackhouse in the balcony of the church that you and I built.
I'm no fool either, Sarah.
You lied to me.
You misled me.
I lost my head because of you.
That's funny.
So did he.
Oh, my God.
Come on, Sarah.
You fornicated with him, too, didn't ya?
That makes four.
Why are you here?
I'm here because you're gonna die tonight, Sarah.
I'm here to give you a choice between heaven and hell because there's still time to save your soul.
There is no heaven, Noomi.
There is only the now and nothingness.
Nothingness?
What is nothingness?
I don't know what nothingness is!
Which is why Christianity is a way better deal!
No.
If you choose Jesus, your meeting with the Heavenly Father which takes place in the Risen Christ through the communion of the Holy Spirit awaits!
Follow the path, Noomi.
Die a Buddhist.
Fuck the path, Sarah.
Die a Christian.
Buddhist!
- Christian!
- Buddhist!
I choose neither!
I choose me!
I am the cure!
I am the messiah!
I choose myself.
That's a bad fuckin' call right there, Sarah.
You never could stand on your own two feet.
What was that?
What, you need me to spell it out for ya?
That's death coming for ya.

Did your sister come to see you, Amber?
Amber, answer the fuckin' question!
She's not gonna tell us anything.
Well, maybe it's 'cause you're not asking the questions right.
What's the matter, sugar, do those chains hurt?
"Sugar"?
He's right.
I ain't telling' y'all shit.
( grunts )
Maybe you're both asking the question wrong.
- May I?
- Go ahead.
Hello, Amber.
My name's Mr. Gus.
Now, Mr. Northman and Ms. De Beaufort tell me that your sister was paying you to remain in hiding.
Is that correct?
So then would you say money is a primary motivator for you?
Because, Amber, if we are correct in assuming that your sister's in possession of an antidote for this virus, it could mean a lot of money for all of us.
Did Sarah come to see you?
Her name is not Sarah.
It's Noomi, and she is a good person.
Yeah, a good person who created a virus that's killing off every single vampire on the planet.
Except now she's the cure.
Did you just say Sarah is the cure?
Now, your sister may have healed you, but she is killing me.
She killed Jeremy.
You loved Jeremy.
- May I?
- She's all yours.
And Jeremy loved you.
You were happy together.
But then your sister--
Sarah or Noomi or whatever you want to call her-- she set fire to that happiness.
( clicks )
She killed him.
Stop it.
Pam:
Time's wasting, Amber.
Tell us where she is.
I can't.
She saved me.
Well, stop trying to save her.
Fuck you!
( distorted voice ) She's my sister.
( growls )
- ( screams ) - ( gasps )
- No.

You recognize this truck?

Brian?
Who's Brian?
Wade and Rocky's father, my ex-husband.
Well, they should be here, then.
Adilyn!
Wade, honey, if you're here, come on out.
With your hands up where I can see them.
You don't have to be so dramatic.
- They didn't break any law.
- Like hell they didn't.
They're perverts and they're out here in violation of a parish-wide curfew.
( sighs ) Wade?
- What-- what are you doing?
- Calling her.
Even if they don't wanna answer, teenagers can have a Pavlovian response to a ringing cell phone.
( ringtone playing )
Sookie:
Why is it happening so fast?
I don't know.
Is it because I'm fae?
I don't know.
( phone ringing )
It's mine.
- ( ringing continues )
- Are you gonna get it?
I ain't even sure I can stand up.
In that case, I'll get it.
No, I'll get it.
Sookie, please.
I'm not dead yet.
( ringing continues )
Hello?
Vampire Bill, it's Andy.
Is Jessica around?
Is that Andy?
Passing you over.
Andy, shit, I am so sorry.
I-
- I completely forgot about y'all.
Andy:
Don't worry about it, Jessica.
We ain't even home.
Well, where are you?
Uh, Adilyn's had your blood, right?
Uh, yeah.
But I-
- Andy, I only did it because I--
So you'd feel her, right?
If-- if she were in danger, if anything bad happened to her?
Uh, yeah.
Well, have you felt her?
No, why?
You haven't?
Oh, well, that's great.
- Holly:
Thank God.
- Andy:
That's great.
Wait, Andy, what's happened?
Adilyn and Wade ran off together.
Oh, my God.
Do you need my help?
No, we're already out here looking for them.
Just, uh, do me a favor.
Promise me if you do feel her, give me a call, or even if you hear from her.
- Yeah, of course.
But, Andy?
- Yeah?
If you find them, will you call me?
( chuckles ) You got it, Red.
( sighs )
Well, the good news is they're alive.
But where the fuck do we look now?
Brian has a lake house.
Shit, that's it.
Let's go.
Where is this lake house, anyhow?
Half hour north of Oklahoma City.
- Oklahoma?
- I know.
When we get there, I'm gonna hug them, but then I'm gonna kill them.
Here we are.
Home, sweet home.
( laughs ) Oh, my God.
- Wow.
- You like?
This is amazing.
Yeah, it's-- it's cool.
Wow.
Just breaks my heart that your parents don't support the love that you feel for each other.
Oh, and for what it's worth, when I was your age,
I used to fuck my brother, too.
A lot.
( clicks tongue )
This way.
Okay.
So, there's a fully stocked fridge with snacks.
Sling is over there, nipple clamps on the bedside table with some erotic oils and handcuffs.
Dildos and toys are on the wall.
Oh, I got that strap-on in Zanzibar in the 19th century.
It was one of the first of its kind.
- What's--
- What's it for?
( laughs ) You sweet, sweet boy.
Your imagination's a muscle.
Use it or lose it.
( laughs )
Now I'm gonna go get some shut-eye.
You'll be safe here, and you can stay as long as you like.
- Are we cool?
- Totally.
Yeah.
- And, Violet?
- Hmm?
Thank you for everything.
Yeah, thanks.
Aw, you don't have to thank me.
I love love, and watching love flourish is all the thanks I need.
( both laugh )
Have fun fucking.
- ( laughs ) - ( door closes )
( clock ticking )
Bill.
This isn't happening.
Bill:
Yeah, Sookie, it is.
In your book you mentioned an experimental treatment in, um-- in India?
It's years away.
Gotta be something to slow this thing down.
Sookie, there's no cure.
I refuse to accept that.
( gasps ) Oh, my God!
I didn't mean to frighten you.
Well, you did.
Matter of fact, you scared the bejeezus outta me.
My apologies.
I know you've been through a great deal of suffering as of late and I should have known better than to sneak up on you.
Why did you, then?
Because, Arlene, it's still not safe for you to be out alone at night.
I came to see you home... to offer you my protection.
Well, just so long as you don't get the wrong idea, 'cause, to be honest, Keith, this is silly.
I mean, what are you, 25?
I'm 515 years old.
Look, you're very attractive, but I am not a fangbanger, okay?
I know who I am.
And a human with a vampire is just wrong.
You know?
( gasps )
Did that feel wrong?
Yes.
What about that?
That feel wrong?
Huh?
( whimpers )
( gasps ) What are you doing?
( moaning )
( gasps )
( moaning continues )
Oh, God.
( moaning continues )
- ( wincing )
- Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God, Oh, fu-uck.
( speaking Japanese )
You shouldn't have killed her.
She wasn't gonna cooperate anyway.
She was cooperating.
What do you want me to say, Pam?
I saw Sarah on that couch and I fucking lost it.
- Do you wanna die?
- I wanna kill Sarah Newlin.
That's why we came back, remember?
- No.
- No?
She's the antidote, Eric.
She can heal you.
This isn't about capture and kill anymore.
This is about capture and--
Capture and exploit.
You're a capitalist, yes?
I have a business proposition for you.
All right, we're listening.
Together we track down Miss Newlin, we capture her, and we synthesize her blood and we bottle it and distribute it worldwide as a product-
- New Blood.
Catchy.
Now, Yokonomo Corporation will retain controlling interest, of course, but you will own 49% of the company.
I only see one problem.
How the hell are we supposed to find her?
In Japan, business and government work together.
Now, when Tokyo hears about Miss Newlin's potential, we will have immediate access to all of her intelligence assets.
We will find her.
You don't need a partner.
I'm sorry, was that a question?
My word is oak.
Why do you need us?
New Blood will eradicate Hepatitis V from the planet.
Now, the only problem is the public has lost its trust in Yokonomo Corp.
They'll want proof that New Blood works, which means we'll need a vampire's testimonial for the advertising.
You want Eric to be your fuckin' spokesperson for your vampire Jenny Craig commercials?
Now, I ain't a homo, but you have to admit he is a handsome devil.
No.
Do you know what 49% of a three-and-a-half-billion- dollar-a-year company is?
I thought so.
Now, like I said, my word is oak.
What is your word worth?
- You have my word.
- Mr. Gus:
Really?
'Cause I thought I had your word earlier tonight and then you hauled off and killed the sister.
You need me, right?
Well, then you're just gonna have to trust me.
I think I'm gonna stay up, watch him sleep.
I have a better idea.
Why don't you climb in with him?
You don't think that would be weird?
No, honey, I really don't.
And you need your rest, so, come on.
See?
It's not weird.
Sookie?
Yeah?
You said that you refuse to accept this.
But what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
But I meet people every day who say that they don't believe in miracles.
Sometimes they don't say it.
Sometimes they're just thinking it, but when I hear that, I just wanna shake them 'cause how can you not believe in miracles and magic when they're happening all around us every single day?
There's a miracle out there just waiting for Bill.
I just have to go out there and find it.
( sniffles ) I really hope you do.
- All right.
- It's okay.
Good night.
It's morning.
'Course it is.
When I marry, Father, it will be for love.
I'm sorry, son, but you're a man now.
It's time for you to take a wife.
You will marry Caroline Shelby, the neighbor's daughter.
But they've only just moved here.
I haven't even met her yet.
- William--
- I was gonna go to California.
I wanted to see the world.
The Shelbys are a good family and it's important.
- Father, please--
- I'm dying, William.
You will marry Caroline Shelby, not for me, but for your mother.
This way, you see, our lands will combine so she won't have to worry how to get by when I'm gone.
Very well, sir.
I will meet her.
She's just back from finishing school.
I'm sure you'll find her to your liking.
I have met her, William.
She's quite comely.
Hoyt:
This is about the only place in town you can get a decent breakfast.
I thought you said it was called Merlotte's.
It is.
No, it's not.
Look.
Well, I'll be.
Huh.
( music playing )
We got customers, Big John!
And I'm ready for them.
Shi-it.
Welcome to Bellefleur's.
Thank you.
Hoyt?
Arlene.
Oh, my-- oh, sugar, I am so sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
And I'm-- I'm so sorry about Terry.
- Yeah, life is precious.
- Yes, it is.
- Mm.
- Yeah.
Oh, Arlene, this is my girlfriend Brigette.
Nice to meet you, Miss Bardot.
Oh, you are too sweet.
I'm really not.
Well, it's nice to meet you, too.
I didn't know you took the place over.
Yeah, like five months ago, I think it was.
Yeah, business was booming until the H-vamps came.
Did y'all have any problems with them up in Alaska?
Not yet.
We've only been spared because it just about never gets dark where we live this time of year.
I never thought of that.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Brigette's super smart.
We met on the job.
She's a microbiologist.
- Hoyt, stop.
- But she don't like attention, though.
- Ooh.
- Listen, I am starving.
Oh, of course.
Let me get you some menus.
Sit wherever you want.
Can I get y'all something to drink while you decide?
Coffee for me, hot tea for Brigette, and we're in a little bit of a hurry.
I gotta get to the police station to talk to Officer...
Stackhouse.
You mean Jason.
I didn't get a first name.
Just Stackhouse.
- ( cell phone ringing ) - ( music blaring in headphones )
- ( ringing continues ) - ( music and vacuum stop )
Yeah, Stackhouse.
Hoyt's here, Jason.
- What?
Hoyt?
He's where?
- At the BBG.
And he's acting like he doesn't even know you.
Yeah, that's 'cause he doesn't.
Listen, Arlene-
- Arlene, do not say anything to him, all right?
- I'm on my way.
- Okay.
So... should I use this on you?
Uh, how much does it say to use?
Um... it doesn't.
All it says is that its chief ingredient is horny goat weed and that it "invigorates and alleviating fatigue for a stress-reducing effect."
You wanna try something else, then?
Wade thinking:
Okay, just keep cool.
Be a man.
If she's into this stuff, then you gotta do whatever it takes to please your woman, even if you ain't into this at all.
- Oh, thank God!
- What?
You're not into this.
- Are-- are you?
- No.
Oh, my God.
Thank you.
No, Wade, thank you.
You have no idea how happy you just made me.
I just thought you wanted to experiment or something.
No, and I thought that you wanted to on account of you being so much more experienced than me.
Wait, what?
- I--
- What?
Listen, I'm not-- I'm not more experienced.
I mean, our first time was my first time.
Mine, too.
I really do love you, Wade Cleary.
I love you, too.

Mr. Fortenberry?
Ahem, Officer Stackhouse?
Yes, sir.
I'm Hoyt Fortenberry.
This is my girlfriend.
Brigette.
It's nice to meet you, too.
Though I'm sorry about the circumstances.
Well, uh... to be honest, you know, I try not to think about it.
- It just all seems so unreal.
- Hmm.
It'll probably feel more real once you go and see her.
- Hmm?
- Hoyt:
Yeah, I don't know if I'm--
I'm ready for all that yet, but... uh, you wanna join us for breakfast?
Hmm?
You wanna join us for breakfast?
Oh, uh, you guys finish up.
I'll just be waiting over at the bar.
Oh, no, don't be ridiculous.
No, please.
We insist.

- Oh... ( Hoyt chuckles )
- It's okay.

Dr. Ludwig, thank you for coming on such short notice.
- Where's the patient?
- At his house.
I would've had you meet me there, except with him being a vampire and all,
I thought this was safer.
Next time, save yourself some money and have me meet you where the patient is.
I fear nothing and no one and I have no natural enemies.
Well, where is he?
Um, across the cemetery.
( sarcastically ) Ooh, how very spooky.
A cemetery.
Shall we?
- ( music playing ) - ( chatter )
There she is.
- Where?
- Right over there with the Shelbys.
- William.
- Stewart.
- Claire.
- Margaret.
And you must be Caroline.
( chatter, laughter )
I have to admit, you're not what I was expecting.
What were you expecting?
Well, your daddy, only younger and just as--
Rotund?
( both laugh )
No, I take after my mother.
The truth be told, Caroline, you're not quite what I was expecting either.
Oh?
And what were you expecting?
My father described you as "comely."
Well, comely is a good thing.
I know it is, but that word is just so anachronistic that I suppose I thought you'd be--
Old and dowdy?
Formerly pretty, yes.
( laughs )
You feel their eyes on us as aggressively as I do?
Now that you mention it, I can feel all eight of their eyes searing a hole into the back of my head.
Would you care to take a walk with me?
I would.
Dr. Ludwig:
Mr. Compton.
Mr. Compton!
- Mr. Compton!
- Careful, he doesn't like to be woken.
Like I said, I fear nothing and no one.
- Mr. Compton!
- ( growls )
Remember me?
- Doctor?
- Ludwig.
Put your fangs away, son, and meet me in the parlor.
Mm-mm.
Nasty, nasty, nasty.
Whew.
Congratulations, Mr. Compton.
They said it could not be done, but you have thoroughly grossed me out.
Can you help him?
How many days ago do you believe you were infected?
Don't look to her.
I'm the one that asked you the question.
I gotta say, Dr. Ludwig,
I'm a little curious about your bedside manner.
Newsflash-- sometimes monogamy means one thing to hopelessly romantic blonde girls and something altogether different to their vampire lovers.
We are no longer lovers.
Are you sure she knows that?
He contracted the virus from me.
I was exposed through a cut in my arm.
He drank my blood, and he got sick pretty much right away.
I'm sorry, but that's not how this virus works.
Would it make any difference if we told you that Sookie was a halfling?
- Half what?
Half fae?
- Mm-hmm.
A few weeks ago, I was called to the home of a sick vampire in Monroe.
He had a not dissimilarly accelerated rate of infection.
Went from stage one to stage three in 10 days.
I was perplexed until he revealed to me that his boyfriend is a Hep-V positive fairy.
He was no halfling, mind you.
He was the real deal.
And even so, he didn't look anywhere near as bad as Mr. Compton does.
Do you happen to know the name of your line?
- My line?
- Come on, missy.
Your fairy line, your lineage.
I don't know.
I don't know the name.
I guess I could ask Niall.
Niall Brigant?
Yeah, do you know him?
Are you related to Niall Brigant?
Yeah, he's my great-great- great-times-a-thousand-grandfather.
- Why?
- ( panting )
I'm so fuckin' outta here.
- Dr. Ludwig?
- I'll show myself out.
God damn it, Stackhouse.
Get your fuckin' eyes off her.
I should've been here.
Maybe I could've saved her or at least just-- just been here for her when it happened or something.
Hey, babe.
You can't blame yourself.
And I'm sure if she were here right now, your mama would tell you the same thing.
Hoyt:
No, she wouldn't.
If she were here right now, she'd lay it on thick.
God, what I wouldn't give for one more guilt trip.
( crying )
- ( mouths words )
- Huh?
( mouthing words )
( quietly ) Shit.
Hi.
Did you know Maxine?
Um, yeah-- yeah, a little.
Good.
I think he needs to talk to somebody who knew her.
Do you think you could just go and talk to him, maybe?
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
( sniffles )
Uh...
I know it's hard, Mr. Fortenberry.
- How'd it happen?
- Huh?
How'd she die?
Um, well, you remember Vince McNeil?
- The orthodontist?
- Yeah.
Yeah, that's him.
Um... well, when the shit hit the fan at the BBG last week,
Mr. McNeil, he... got a bunch of the townsfolk all riled up, and together they took the law into their own hands.
Was my mama one of them?
No, that-- no.
No, she was not.
She-- she was one of the good folks.
Did you get the son of a bitch that did it to her?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Yeah, I sure did.
Thank you, man.
Grandpa Niall?
( wind blowing )
You know I've been in a lot of situations lately.
I had plenty of good reasons to call on a fairy godfather, but I didn't... until now... 'cause I like to think of myself as strong.
But I ain't this strong.
If you're listening, Grandpa Niall,
I need you to materialize right here, right now.
( wind gusting )
You know what?
Fuck this.
( clatters )
Jesus Christ.
Niall.
Hi.
How do you make that wonderful spaghetti?
This is so good.
- Can we go now?
- No.
Food first.
One mustn't forget to nourish oneself.
Please, I don't know how much time he has left.
I understand, but if this munchkin doctor doesn't know how to heal him, what can I do?
You were watching?
I'm always watching you.
Do you know why she was so afraid of you, then?
We are royalty.
Dwarves have an innate fear of us.
Maybe because we killed so many of them in the past.
I just realized that if you're always watching... did you know I was infecting Bill when he was feeding off of me?
I did.
Why would you let me do that?
I don't like him.
You don't have to like him.
You're doing something for me.
What I meant was I don't like him for you.
Grandpa Niall, you say we're royalty, but other than the vampire-killing light ball that I can only use once, by the way,
I can't think of a single fuckin' = advantage in being what we are.
If you say that we're so fuckin' special,
I am asking you...
I'm begging you... prove it.
Use some of your magic for me.
Fine, Sookie.
I'll try.

Huh.
Well, we all die alone.
What?
You're gonna die tonight.
See, Eric's coming for ya and there ain't no escaping it.
But I don't wanna die.
( laughs ) Well, that's just too fuckin' bad.
See, death comes for all of us, and your number's up.
No.
You're not real.
Maybe not, but death is.
Fuck off!
Yeah, I'll be sure to do that, then.
I'll see you in hell when I get there!
There is no hell.
( chuckles ) You just try to convince yourself of that.
You don't even know--
Hold it together, Noomi.
You are one with the universe.
Keep it together.
Okay?
( beeping )
( speaks Japanese )
( speaks Japanese )
You know how on the news you see these-- these places get wiped out by tornados, but the people who live there are always vowing to rebuild on the exact same spot where tragedy took away everything they had?
I do.
Am I as crazy as they are?
I mean, is Nicole right?
Is this whole town crazy?
'Cause I love her and I wanna be a father to my baby girl, but... this ultimatum's got me.
Why can't I wrap my head around leaving this place?
I mean, at what point does the guy whose house keeps getting hit by a tornado call it a day, take his family, move someplace else?
I can't answer that for you, Sam.
Let me ask you a question.
Better pour me another one first.
I know you, Sam.
I know you better than I think you think I do, and so I know that you've spent your whole life running away from things.
Bon Temps's the only place you actually stopped and stuck it out.
I ain't heard a question yet.
If you left... do you think it would feel more like you were running from something or to something?
Let me put it another way.
If you stayed... could you be happy here without them?
When you can answer the question, you'll know what to do.
Are you happy here, Arlene?
I mean, with everything that's going on and--
I fake it.
See, my hope is the more I fake it, the more I'll believe it until the happiness becomes real.
But, no, Sam, I ain't happy.
But there ain't a chance in hell I'm gonna stop trying to be.
Bon Temps's where my life is.
Everyone I know and love is here.
( knocks ) Adilyn, it's Daddy.
- Wade?
- Okay, here.
I think I got keys in here somewhere.
What, he never changed the locks?
I'm guessing no.
See, even though he hates me, he's as lazy as shit.
What'd I tell you?
Hey, kids, if y'all aren't wearing any clothes, you better put some on 'cause we're coming in.
Wade, honey?
Wade?
Adilyn?
( sighs )
Shit.
Holly:
Where are they?
I mean, there's only so many places they could've gone.
Does Adilyn have any friends or family on her mama's side that she could've gone to?
I don't know, some kind of fairy hangout or something?
Andy?
Baby, you crying, baby?
Something about how peaceful this lake looks, I guess, compared to this fucked-up reality we live in.
- I don't know.
- Oh, okay.
Hey, just take a breath.
- Just breathe.
Oh, baby.
- ( crying )
First you and then it's my baby girl, and I--
( mouths words )
I'm trying to run around, keep y'all safe all the time.
I can't do it no more, Holly.
I'm sorry.
I know.
Oh, honey... of course you can't.
You're just a person.
It was bad enough that I wasn't there that night they took you, but now this-- now this is all on me.
- No.
- Yeah, Adilyn ran away, and that's all 'cause of me.
Hey, hey, that is not true, okay?
And we're gonna get her back.
I know it.
How?
Listen, Andy, I know you love me for a lot of reasons, and I know that my being a Wiccan ain't high up there on that list, but do you believe I'm an intuitive person?
Yeah.
Then you listen to me, Sheriff.
This story's gonna have a happy ending for us, okay?
I know it.
I promise it.
( wind howling )
Are you kidding me?
Grandpa!
What's wrong?
We need to channel nature's memory here.
May I ask to what end?
Bill is inside the house.
How is channeling nature's memory gonna help?
History teaches us great lessons.
We need to look to it, find some answers.
Give me your hands.
( woman wailing )
( wailing continues )
Now, she will pull through, William.
( groaning, yelling )
- ( baby crying )
- Nurse:
Mr. Compton, please come in.
Nurse:
Congratulations, Mr. Compton.
Hi, sweetheart.
She's perfect.
( crying continues )
Wow.
Wow, what?
Didn't you think that was amazing?
I... guess?
Bill's wife gave birth.
So what?
"So what"?
Was I not clear before?
'Cause I thought I made myself perfectly clear when I said I was looking for a miracle.
- That was a miracle.
- Babies are born all the time.
That doesn't make it less miraculous.
There's magic in the ordinary, Sook.
There's magic in the things we can see.
Birth is a miracle.
Love is a miracle.
Death is a miracle.
Forgiveness is a miracle, especially if you can learn to forgive yourself.
Did you bring me here to Bill's house... just to trick me?
No, sweet orphan.
I brought you here because I wanted to give you some advice.
There are some things that can be fixed with magic.
But your vampire friend is not one of them.
I'm sorry.
Thank you for the life lesson.
Can you go now, please?

You fornicated with him, too, didn't ya?

I'm here because you're gonna die tonight, Sarah.
I'm here to give you a choice between heaven and hell because there's still time to save your soul.
There is no heaven, Noomi.
There is only the now and nothingness.
Nothingness?
What is nothingness?
I don't know what nothingness is!
Which is why Christianity is a way better deal!
Sarah:
No.
If you choose Jesus, your meeting with the Heavenly Father which takes place in the Risen Christ through the communion of the Holy Spirit awaits!
Follow the path, Noomi.
Die a Buddhist.
Fuck the path, Sarah.
Die a Christian.
Buddhist!
- Christian!
- Buddhist!
I choose neither!
I choose me!
I am the cure!
I am the messiah!
- I choose myself.

Did your sister come to see you, Amber?
Amber, answer the fuckin' question!
She's not gonna tell us anything.
Well, maybe it's 'cause you're not asking the questions right.
What's the matter, sugar, do those chains hurt?
"Sugar"?
He's right.
I ain't telling' y'all shit.
( grunts )
Maybe you're both asking the question wrong.
- May I?
- Go ahead.
Hello, Amber.
My name's Mr. Gus.
Now, Mr. Northman and Ms. De Beaufort tell me that your sister was paying you to remain in hiding.
Is that correct?
So then would you say money is a primary motivator for you?
Because, Amber, if we are correct in assuming that your sister's in possession of an antidote for this virus, it could mean a lot of money for all of us.
Did Sarah come to see you?
Her name is not Sarah.
It's Noomi, and she is a good person.
Yeah, a good person who created a virus that's killing off every single vampire on the planet.
Except now she's the cure.
Did you just say Sarah is the cure?
Now, your sister may have healed you, but she is killing me.
She killed Jeremy.
You loved Jeremy.
- May I?
- She's all yours.
And Jeremy loved you.
You were happy together.
But then your sister--
Sarah or Noomi or whatever you want to call her-- she set fire to that happiness.
( clicks )
She killed him.
Stop it.
Pam:
Time's wasting, Amber.

I can't.

Who's Brian?
Wade and Rocky's father, my ex-husband.
Well, they should be here, then.
Adilyn!
Wade, honey, if you're here, come on out.
With your hands up where I can see them.
You don't have to be so dramatic.
- They didn't break any law.
- Like hell they didn't.
They're perverts and they're out here in violation of a parish-wide curfew.
( sighs ) Wade?
- What-- what are you doing?
- Calling her.
Even if they don't wanna answer, teenagers can have a Pavlovian response to a ringing cell phone.

Why is it happening so fast?
I don't know.
Is it because I'm fae?
I don't know.

Hello?
Vampire Bill, it's Andy.
Is Jessica around?
Is that Andy?
Passing you over.
Andy, shit, I am so sorry.
I-
- I completely forgot about y'all.
Andy:
Don't worry about it, Jessica.
We ain't even home.
Well, where are you?
Uh, Adilyn's had your blood, right?
Uh, yeah.
But I-
- Andy, I only did it because I--
So you'd feel her, right?
If-- if she were in danger, if anything bad happened to her?
Uh, yeah.
Well, have you felt her?
No, why?
You haven't?
Oh, well, that's great.
- Holly:
Thank God.
- Andy:
That's great.
Wait, Andy, what's happened?
Adilyn and Wade ran off together.
Oh, my God.
Do you need my help?
No, we're already out here looking for them.
Just, uh, do me a favor.
Promise me if you do feel her, give me a call, or even if you hear from her.
- Yeah, of course.
But, Andy?
- Yeah?
If you find them, will you call me?
( chuckles ) You got it, Red.
( sighs )
Well, the good news is they're alive.
But where the fuck do we look now?
Brian has a lake house.
Shit, that's it.
Let's go.
Where is this lake house, anyhow?
Half hour north of Oklahoma City.
- Oklahoma?
- I know.
When we get there, I'm gonna hug them, but then I'm gonna kill them.
Here we are.
Home, sweet home.
( laughs ) Oh, my God.
- Wow.
- You like?
This is amazing.
Yeah, it's-- it's cool.
Wow.
Just breaks my heart that your parents don't support the love that you feel for each other.
Oh, and for what it's worth, when I was your age,
I used to fuck my brother, too.
A lot.
( clicks tongue )
This way.
Okay.
So, there's a fully stocked fridge with snacks.
Sling is over there, nipple clamps on the bedside table with some erotic oils and handcuffs.
Dildos and toys are on the wall.
Oh, I got that strap-on in Zanzibar in the 19th century.
It was one of the first of its kind.
- What's--
- What's it for?
( laughs ) You sweet, sweet boy.
Your imagination's a muscle.
Use it or lose it.
( laughs )
Now I'm gonna go get some shut-eye.
You'll be safe here, and you can stay as long as you like.
- Are we cool?
- Totally.
Yeah.
- And, Violet?
- Hmm?
Thank you for everything.
Yeah, thanks.
Aw, you don't have to thank me.
I love love, and watching love flourish is all the thanks I need.
( both laugh )
Have fun fucking.
- ( laughs ) - ( door closes )
( clock ticking )
Bill.
This isn't happening.
Bill:
Yeah, Sookie, it is.
In your book you mentioned an experimental treatment in, um-- in India?
It's years away.
Gotta be something to slow this thing down.
Sookie, there's no cure.
I refuse to accept that.
( gasps ) Oh, my God!
I didn't mean to frighten you.
Well, you did.
Matter of fact, you scared the bejeezus outta me.
My apologies.
I know you've been through a great deal of suffering as of late and I should have known better than to sneak up on you.
Why did you, then?
Because, Arlene, it's still not safe for you to be out alone at night.
I came to see you home... to offer you my protection.
Well, just so long as you don't get the wrong idea, 'cause, to be honest, Keith, this is silly.
I mean, what are you, 25?
I'm 515 years old.
Look, you're very attractive, but I am not a fangbanger, okay?
I know who I am.
And a human with a vampire is just wrong.
You know?
( gasps )
Did that feel wrong?
Yes.
What about that?
That feel wrong?
Huh?
( whimpers )
( gasps ) What are you doing?
( moaning )
( gasps )
( moaning continues )
Oh, God.
( moaning continues )
- ( wincing )
- Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God, Oh, fu-uck.
( speaking Japanese )
You shouldn't have killed her.
She wasn't gonna cooperate anyway.
She was cooperating.
What do you want me to say, Pam?
I saw Sarah on that couch and I fucking lost it.
- Do you wanna die?
- I wanna kill Sarah Newlin.
That's why we came back, remember?
- No.
- No?
She's the antidote, Eric.
She can heal you.
This isn't about capture and kill anymore.
This is about capture and--
Capture and exploit.
You're a capitalist, yes?
I have a business proposition for you.
All right, we're listening.
Together we track down Miss Newlin, we capture her, and we synthesize her blood and we bottle it and distribute it worldwide as a product-
- New Blood.
Catchy.
Now, Yokonomo Corporation will retain controlling interest, of course, but you will own 49% of the company.
I only see one problem.
How the hell are we supposed to find her?
In Japan, business and government work together.
Now, when Tokyo hears about Miss Newlin's potential, we will have immediate access to all of her intelligence assets.
We will find her.
You don't need a partner.
I'm sorry, was that a question?
My word is oak.
Why do you need us?
New Blood will eradicate Hepatitis V from the planet.
Now, the only problem is the public has lost its trust in Yokonomo Corp.
They'll want proof that New Blood works, which means we'll need a vampire's testimonial for the advertising.
You want Eric to be your fuckin' spokesperson for your vampire Jenny Craig commercials?
Now, I ain't a homo, but you have to admit he is a handsome devil.
No.
Do you know what 49% of a three-and-a-half-billion- dollar-a-year company is?
I thought so.
Now, like I said, my word is oak.
What is your word worth?
- You have my word.
- Mr. Gus:
Really?
'Cause I thought I had your word earlier tonight and then you hauled off and killed the sister.
You need me, right?
Well, then you're just gonna have to trust me.
I think I'm gonna stay up, watch him sleep.
I have a better idea.
Why don't you climb in with him?
You don't think that would be weird?
No, honey, I really don't.
And you need your rest, so, come on.
See?
It's not weird.
Sookie?
Yeah?
You said that you refuse to accept this.
But what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
But I meet people every day who say that they don't believe in miracles.
Sometimes they don't say it.
Sometimes they're just thinking it, but when I hear that, I just wanna shake them 'cause how can you not believe in miracles and magic when they're happening all around us every single day?
There's a miracle out there just waiting for Bill.
I just have to go out there and find it.
( sniffles ) I really hope you do.
- All right.
- It's okay.
Good night.
It's morning.
'Course it is.
When I marry, Father, it will be for love.
I'm sorry, son, but you're a man now.
It's time for you to take a wife.
You will marry Caroline Shelby, the neighbor's daughter.
But they've only just moved here.
I haven't even met her yet.
- William--
- I was gonna go to California.
I wanted to see the world.
The Shelbys are a good family and it's important.
- Father, please--
- I'm dying, William.
You will marry Caroline Shelby, not for me, but for your mother.
This way, you see, our lands will combine so she won't have to worry how to get by when I'm gone.
Very well, sir.
I will meet her.
She's just back from finishing school.
I'm sure you'll find her to your liking.
I have met her, William.
She's quite comely.
Hoyt:
This is about the only place in town you can get a decent breakfast.
I thought you said it was called Merlotte's.
It is.
No, it's not.
Look.
Well, I'll be.
Huh.
( music playing )
We got customers, Big John!
And I'm ready for them.
Shi-it.
Welcome to Bellefleur's.
Thank you.
Hoyt?
Arlene.
Oh, my-- oh, sugar, I am so sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
And I'm-- I'm so sorry about Terry.
- Yeah, life is precious.
- Yes, it is.
- Mm.
- Yeah.
Oh, Arlene, this is my girlfriend Brigette.
Nice to meet you, Miss Bardot.
Oh, you are too sweet.
I'm really not.
Well, it's nice to meet you, too.
I didn't know you took the place over.
Yeah, like five months ago, I think it was.
Yeah, business was booming until the H-vamps came.
Did y'all have any problems with them up in Alaska?
Not yet.
We've only been spared because it just about never gets dark where we live this time of year.
I never thought of that.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Brigette's super smart.
We met on the job.
She's a microbiologist.
- Hoyt, stop.
- But she don't like attention, though.
- Ooh.
- Listen, I am starving.
Oh, of course.
Let me get you some menus.
Sit wherever you want.
Can I get y'all something to drink while you decide?
Coffee for me, hot tea for Brigette, and we're in a little bit of a hurry.
I gotta get to the police station to talk to Officer...
Stackhouse.
You mean Jason.
I didn't get a first name.
Just Stackhouse.
- ( cell phone ringing ) - ( music blaring in headphones )
- ( ringing continues ) - ( music and vacuum stop )
Yeah, Stackhouse.
Hoyt's here, Jason.
- What?
Hoyt?
He's where?
- At the BBG.
And he's acting like he doesn't even know you.
Yeah, that's 'cause he doesn't.
Listen, Arlene-
- Arlene, do not say anything to him, all right?
- I'm on my way.
- Okay.
So... should I use this on you?
Uh, how much does it say to use?
Um... it doesn't.
All it says is that its chief ingredient is horny goat weed and that it "invigorates and alleviating fatigue for a stress-reducing effect."
You wanna try something else, then?
Wade thinking:
Okay, just keep cool.
Be a man.
If she's into this stuff, then you gotta do whatever it takes to please your woman, even if you ain't into this at all.
- Oh, thank God!
- What?
You're not into this.
- Are-- are you?
- No.
Oh, my God.
Thank you.
No, Wade, thank you.
You have no idea how happy you just made me.
I just thought you wanted to experiment or something.
No, and I thought that you wanted to on account of you being so much more experienced than me.
Wait, what?
- I--
- What?
Listen, I'm not-- I'm not more experienced.
I mean, our first time was my first time.
Mine, too.
I really do love you, Wade Cleary.
I love you, too.

It's nice to meet you, too.
Though I'm sorry about the circumstances.
Well, uh... to be honest, you know, I try not to think about it.
- It just all seems so unreal.
- Hmm.
It'll probably feel more real once you go and see her.
- Hmm?
- Hoyt:
Yeah, I don't know if I'm--
I'm ready for all that yet, but... uh, you wanna join us for breakfast?

You wanna join us for breakfast?
Oh, uh, you guys finish up.
I'll just be waiting over at the bar.

Dr. Ludwig, thank you for coming on such short notice.
- Where's the patient?
- At his house.
I would've had you meet me there, except with him being a vampire and all,
I thought this was safer.
Next time, save yourself some money and have me meet you where the patient is.
I fear nothing and no one and I have no natural enemies.
Well, where is he?
Um, across the cemetery.
( sarcastically ) Ooh, how very spooky.
A cemetery.
Shall we?
- ( music playing ) - ( chatter )
There she is.
- Where?
- Right over there with the Shelbys.
- William.
- Stewart.
- Claire.
- Margaret.
And you must be Caroline.
( chatter, laughter )
I have to admit, you're not what I was expecting.
What were you expecting?
Well, your daddy, only younger and just as--
Rotund?
( both laugh )
No, I take after my mother.
The truth be told, Caroline, you're not quite what I was expecting either.
Oh?
And what were you expecting?
My father described you as "comely."
Well, comely is a good thing.
I know it is, but that word is just so anachronistic that I suppose I thought you'd be--
Old and dowdy?
Formerly pretty, yes.
( laughs )
You feel their eyes on us as aggressively as I do?
Now that you mention it, I can feel all eight of their eyes searing a hole into the back of my head.
Would you care to take a walk with me?
I would.
Dr. Ludwig:
Mr. Compton.
Mr. Compton!
- Mr. Compton!
- Careful, he doesn't like to be woken.
Like I said, I fear nothing and no one.
- Mr. Compton!
- ( growls )
Remember me?
- Doctor?
- Ludwig.
Put your fangs away, son, and meet me in the parlor.
Mm-mm.
Nasty, nasty, nasty.
Whew.
Congratulations, Mr. Compton.
They said it could not be done, but you have thoroughly grossed me out.
Can you help him?
How many days ago do you believe you were infected?
Don't look to her.
I'm the one that asked you the question.
I gotta say, Dr. Ludwig,
I'm a little curious about your bedside manner.
Newsflash-- sometimes monogamy means one thing to hopelessly romantic blonde girls and something altogether different to their vampire lovers.
We are no longer lovers.
Are you sure she knows that?
He contracted the virus from me.
I was exposed through a cut in my arm.
He drank my blood, and he got sick pretty much right away.
I'm sorry, but that's not how this virus works.
Would it make any difference if we told you that Sookie was a halfling?
- Half what?
Half fae?
- Mm-hmm.
A few weeks ago, I was called to the home of a sick vampire in Monroe.
He had a not dissimilarly accelerated rate of infection.
Went from stage one to stage three in 10 days.
I was perplexed until he revealed to me that his boyfriend is a Hep-V positive fairy.
He was no halfling, mind you.
He was the real deal.
And even so, he didn't look anywhere near as bad as Mr. Compton does.
Do you happen to know the name of your line?
- My line?
- Come on, missy.
Your fairy line, your lineage.
I don't know.
I don't know the name.
I guess I could ask Niall.
Niall Brigant?
Yeah, do you know him?
Are you related to Niall Brigant?
Yeah, he's my great-great- great-times-a-thousand-grandfather.
- Why?
- ( panting )
I'm so fuckin' outta here.
- Dr. Ludwig?
- I'll show myself out.
God damn it, Stackhouse.
Get your fuckin' eyes off her.
I should've been here.
Maybe I could've saved her or at least just-- just been here for her when it happened or something.
Hey, babe.
You can't blame yourself.
And I'm sure if she were here right now, your mama would tell you the same thing.
Hoyt:
No, she wouldn't.
If she were here right now, she'd lay it on thick.
God, what I wouldn't give for one more guilt trip.
( crying )
- ( mouths words )
- Huh?
( mouthing words )
( quietly ) Shit.
Hi.
Did you know Maxine?
Um, yeah-- yeah, a little.
Good.
I think he needs to talk to somebody who knew her.
Do you think you could just go and talk to him, maybe?
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
( sniffles )
Uh...
I know it's hard, Mr. Fortenberry.
- How'd it happen?
- Huh?
How'd she die?
Um, well, you remember Vince McNeil?
- The orthodontist?
- Yeah.
Yeah, that's him.
Um... well, when the shit hit the fan at the BBG last week,
Mr. McNeil, he... got a bunch of the townsfolk all riled up, and together they took the law into their own hands.
Was my mama one of them?
No, that-- no.
No, she was not.
She-- she was one of the good folks.
Did you get the son of a bitch that did it to her?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Yeah, I sure did.
Thank you, man.
Grandpa Niall?
( wind blowing )
You know I've been in a lot of situations lately.
I had plenty of good reasons to call on a fairy godfather, but I didn't... until now... 'cause I like to think of myself as strong.
But I ain't this strong.
If you're listening, Grandpa Niall,
I need you to materialize right here, right now.
( wind gusting )
You know what?
Fuck this.
( clatters )
Jesus Christ.
Niall.
Hi.
How do you make that wonderful spaghetti?
This is so good.
- Can we go now?
- No.
Food first.
One mustn't forget to nourish oneself.
Please, I don't know how much time he has left.
I understand, but if this munchkin doctor doesn't know how to heal him, what can I do?
You were watching?
I'm always watching you.
Do you know why she was so afraid of you, then?
We are royalty.
Dwarves have an innate fear of us.
Maybe because we killed so many of them in the past.
I just realized that if you're always watching... did you know I was infecting Bill when he was feeding off of me?
I did.
Why would you let me do that?
I don't like him.
You don't have to like him.
You're doing something for me.
What I meant was I don't like him for you.
Grandpa Niall, you say we're royalty, but other than the vampire-killing light ball that I can only use once, by the way,
I can't think of a single fuckin' = advantage in being what we are.
If you say that we're so fuckin' special,
I am asking you...
I'm begging you... prove it.
Use some of your magic for me.
Fine, Sookie.
I'll try.

Well, we all die alone.
What?
You're gonna die tonight.
See, Eric's coming for ya and there ain't no escaping it.
But I don't wanna die.
( laughs ) Well, that's just too fuckin' bad.
See, death comes for all of us, and your number's up.
No.
You're not real.
Maybe not, but death is.
Fuck off!
Yeah, I'll be sure to do that, then.

There is no hell.

Keep it together.
Okay?
( beeping )
( speaks Japanese )
( speaks Japanese )
You know how on the news you see these-- these places get wiped out by tornados, but the people who live there are always vowing to rebuild on the exact same spot where tragedy took away everything they had?
I do.
Am I as crazy as they are?
I mean, is Nicole right?
Is this whole town crazy?
'Cause I love her and I wanna be a father to my baby girl, but... this ultimatum's got me.
Why can't I wrap my head around leaving this place?
I mean, at what point does the guy whose house keeps getting hit by a tornado call it a day, take his family, move someplace else?
I can't answer that for you, Sam.
Let me ask you a question.
Better pour me another one first.
I know you, Sam.
I know you better than I think you think I do, and so I know that you've spent your whole life running away from things.
Bon Temps's the only place you actually stopped and stuck it out.
I ain't heard a question yet.
If you left... do you think it would feel more like you were running from something or to something?
Let me put it another way.
If you stayed... could you be happy here without them?
When you can answer the question, you'll know what to do.
Are you happy here, Arlene?
I mean, with everything that's going on and--
I fake it.
See, my hope is the more I fake it, the more I'll believe it until the happiness becomes real.
But, no, Sam, I ain't happy.
But there ain't a chance in hell I'm gonna stop trying to be.
Bon Temps's where my life is.
Everyone I know and love is here.
( knocks ) Adilyn, it's Daddy.
- Wade?
- Okay, here.
I think I got keys in here somewhere.
What, he never changed the locks?
I'm guessing no.
See, even though he hates me, he's as lazy as shit.
What'd I tell you?
Hey, kids, if y'all aren't wearing any clothes, you better put some on 'cause we're coming in.
Wade, honey?
Wade?
Adilyn?
( sighs )
Shit.
Holly:
Where are they?
I mean, there's only so many places they could've gone.
Does Adilyn have any friends or family on her mama's side that she could've gone to?
I don't know, some kind of fairy hangout or something?
Andy?
Baby, you crying, baby?
Something about how peaceful this lake looks, I guess, compared to this fucked-up reality we live in.
- I don't know.
- Oh, okay.
Hey, just take a breath.
- Just breathe.
Oh, baby.
- ( crying )
First you and then it's my baby girl, and I--
( mouths words )
I'm trying to run around, keep y'all safe all the time.
I can't do it no more, Holly.
I'm sorry.
I know.
Oh, honey... of course you can't.
You're just a person.
It was bad enough that I wasn't there that night they took you, but now this-- now this is all on me.
- No.
- Yeah, Adilyn ran away, and that's all 'cause of me.
Hey, hey, that is not true, okay?
And we're gonna get her back.
I know it.
How?
Listen, Andy, I know you love me for a lot of reasons, and I know that my being a Wiccan ain't high up there on that list, but do you believe I'm an intuitive person?
Yeah.
Then you listen to me, Sheriff.
This story's gonna have a happy ending for us, okay?
I know it.
I promise it.
( wind howling )
Are you kidding me?
Grandpa!
What's wrong?
We need to channel nature's memory here.
May I ask to what end?
Bill is inside the house.
How is channeling nature's memory gonna help?
History teaches us great lessons.
We need to look to it, find some answers.
Give me your hands.
( woman wailing )

Now, she will pull through, William.
( groaning, yelling )
- ( baby crying )
- Nurse:
Mr. Compton, please come in.
Nurse:
Congratulations, Mr. Compton.
Hi, sweetheart.
She's perfect.
( crying continues )
Wow.
Wow, what?
Didn't you think that was amazing?
I... guess?
Bill's wife gave birth.
So what?
"So what"?
Was I not clear before?
'Cause I thought I made myself perfectly clear when I said I was looking for a miracle.
- That was a miracle.
- Babies are born all the time.
That doesn't make it less miraculous.
There's magic in the ordinary, Sook.
There's magic in the things we can see.
Birth is a miracle.
Love is a miracle.
Death is a miracle.
Forgiveness is a miracle, especially if you can learn to forgive yourself.
Did you bring me here to Bill's house... just to trick me?
No, sweet orphan.
I brought you here because I wanted to give you some advice.
There are some things that can be fixed with magic.
But your vampire friend is not one of them.
I'm sorry.
Thank you for the life lesson.
Can you go now, please?

Did your sister come to see you, Amber?
Amber, answer the fuckin' question!
She's not gonna tell us anything.
Well, maybe it's 'cause you're not asking the questions right.
What's the matter, sugar, do those chains hurt?
"Sugar"?
He's right.
I ain't telling' y'all shit.
( grunts )
Maybe you're both asking the question wrong.
- May I?
- Go ahead.
Hello, Amber.
My name's Mr. Gus.
Now, Mr. Northman and Ms. De Beaufort tell me that your sister was paying you to remain in hiding.
Is that correct?
So then would you say money is a primary motivator for you?
Because, Amber, if we are correct in assuming that your sister's in possession of an antidote for this virus, it could mean a lot of money for all of us.
Did Sarah come to see you?
Her name is not Sarah.
It's Noomi, and she is a good person.
Yeah, a good person who created a virus that's killing off every single vampire on the planet.
Except now she's the cure.
Did you just say Sarah is the cure?
Now, your sister may have healed you, but she is killing me.
She killed Jeremy.
You loved Jeremy.
- May I?
- She's all yours.
And Jeremy loved you.
You were happy together.
But then your sister--
Sarah or Noomi or whatever you want to call her-- she set fire to that happiness.
( clicks )
She killed him.
Stop it.
Pam:
Time's wasting, Amber.
Tell us where she is.
I can't.
She saved me.
Well, stop trying to save her.
Fuck you!
( distorted voice ) She's my sister.
( growls )
- ( screams ) - ( gasps )
- No.
- ( speaks Japanese )
Eric.

No one's here.
You recognize this truck?
Yes, it's Brian's.
Brian?
Who's Brian?
Wade and Rocky's father, my ex-husband.
Well, they should be here, then.
Adilyn!
Wade, honey, if you're here, come on out.
With your hands up where I can see them.
You don't have to be so dramatic.
- They didn't break any law.
- Like hell they didn't.
They're perverts and they're out here in violation of a parish-wide curfew.
( sighs ) Wade?
- What-- what are you doing?
- Calling her.
Even if they don't wanna answer, teenagers can have a Pavlovian response to a ringing cell phone.
( ringtone playing )
Sookie:
Why is it happening so fast?
I don't know.
Is it because I'm fae?
I don't know.
( phone ringing )
It's mine.
- ( ringing continues )
- Are you gonna get it?
I ain't even sure I can stand up.
In that case, I'll get it.
No, I'll get it.
Sookie, please.
I'm not dead yet.
( ringing continues )
Hello?
Vampire Bill, it's Andy.
Is Jessica around?
Is that Andy?
Passing you over.
Andy, shit, I am so sorry.
I-
- I completely forgot about y'all.
Andy:
Don't worry about it, Jessica.
We ain't even home.
Well, where are you?
Uh, Adilyn's had your blood, right?
Uh, yeah.
But I-
- Andy, I only did it because I--
So you'd feel her, right?
If-- if she were in danger, if anything bad happened to her?
Uh, yeah.
Well, have you felt her?
No, why?
You haven't?
Oh, well, that's great.
- Holly:
Thank God.
- Andy:
That's great.
Wait, Andy, what's happened?
Adilyn and Wade ran off together.
Oh, my God.
Do you need my help?
No, we're already out here looking for them.
Just, uh, do me a favor.
Promise me if you do feel her, give me a call, or even if you hear from her.
- Yeah, of course.
But, Andy?
- Yeah?
If you find them, will you call me?
( chuckles ) You got it, Red.
( sighs )
Well, the good news is they're alive.
But where the fuck do we look now?
Brian has a lake house.
Shit, that's it.
Let's go.
Where is this lake house, anyhow?
Half hour north of Oklahoma City.
- Oklahoma?
- I know.
When we get there, I'm gonna hug them, but then I'm gonna kill them.
Here we are.
Home, sweet home.
( laughs ) Oh, my God.
- Wow.
- You like?
This is amazing.
Yeah, it's-- it's cool.
Wow.
Just breaks my heart that your parents don't support the love that you feel for each other.
Oh, and for what it's worth, when I was your age,
I used to fuck my brother, too.
A lot.
( clicks tongue )
This way.
Okay.
So, there's a fully stocked fridge with snacks.
Sling is over there, nipple clamps on the bedside table with some erotic oils and handcuffs.
Dildos and toys are on the wall.
Oh, I got that strap-on in Zanzibar in the 19th century.
It was one of the first of its kind.
- What's--
- What's it for?
( laughs ) You sweet, sweet boy.
Your imagination's a muscle.
Use it or lose it.
( laughs )
Now I'm gonna go get some shut-eye.
You'll be safe here, and you can stay as long as you like.
- Are we cool?
- Totally.
Yeah.
- And, Violet?
- Hmm?
Thank you for everything.
Yeah, thanks.
Aw, you don't have to thank me.
I love love, and watching love flourish is all the thanks I need.
( both laugh )
Have fun fucking.
- ( laughs ) - ( door closes )
( clock ticking )
Bill.
This isn't happening.
Bill:
Yeah, Sookie, it is.
In your book you mentioned an experimental treatment in, um-- in India?
It's years away.
Gotta be something to slow this thing down.
Sookie, there's no cure.
I refuse to accept that.
( gasps ) Oh, my God!
I didn't mean to frighten you.
Well, you did.
Matter of fact, you scared the bejeezus outta me.
My apologies.
I know you've been through a great deal of suffering as of late and I should have known better than to sneak up on you.
Why did you, then?
Because, Arlene, it's still not safe for you to be out alone at night.
I came to see you home... to offer you my protection.
Well, just so long as you don't get the wrong idea, 'cause, to be honest, Keith, this is silly.
I mean, what are you, 25?
I'm 515 years old.
Look, you're very attractive, but I am not a fangbanger, okay?
I know who I am.
And a human with a vampire is just wrong.
You know?
( gasps )
Did that feel wrong?
Yes.
What about that?
That feel wrong?
Huh?
( whimpers )
( gasps ) What are you doing?
( moaning )
( gasps )
( moaning continues )
Oh, God.
( moaning continues )
- ( wincing )
- Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God, Oh, fu-uck.
( speaking Japanese )
You shouldn't have killed her.
She wasn't gonna cooperate anyway.
She was cooperating.
What do you want me to say, Pam?
I saw Sarah on that couch and I fucking lost it.
- Do you wanna die?
- I wanna kill Sarah Newlin.
That's why we came back, remember?
- No.
- No?
She's the antidote, Eric.
She can heal you.
This isn't about capture and kill anymore.
This is about capture and--
Capture and exploit.
You're a capitalist, yes?
I have a business proposition for you.
All right, we're listening.
Together we track down Miss Newlin, we capture her, and we synthesize her blood and we bottle it and distribute it worldwide as a product-
- New Blood.
Catchy.
Now, Yokonomo Corporation will retain controlling interest, of course, but you will own 49% of the company.
I only see one problem.
How the hell are we supposed to find her?
In Japan, business and government work together.
Now, when Tokyo hears about Miss Newlin's potential, we will have immediate access to all of her intelligence assets.
We will find her.
You don't need a partner.
I'm sorry, was that a question?
My word is oak.
Why do you need us?
New Blood will eradicate Hepatitis V from the planet.
Now, the only problem is the public has lost its trust in Yokonomo Corp.
They'll want proof that New Blood works, which means we'll need a vampire's testimonial for the advertising.
You want Eric to be your fuckin' spokesperson for your vampire Jenny Craig commercials?
Now, I ain't a homo, but you have to admit he is a handsome devil.
No.
Do you know what 49% of a three-and-a-half-billion- dollar-a-year company is?
I thought so.
Now, like I said, my word is oak.
What is your word worth?
- You have my word.
- Mr. Gus:
Really?
'Cause I thought I had your word earlier tonight and then you hauled off and killed the sister.
You need me, right?
Well, then you're just gonna have to trust me.
I think I'm gonna stay up, watch him sleep.
I have a better idea.
Why don't you climb in with him?
You don't think that would be weird?
No, honey, I really don't.
And you need your rest, so, come on.
See?
It's not weird.
Sookie?
Yeah?
You said that you refuse to accept this.
But what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
But I meet people every day who say that they don't believe in miracles.
Sometimes they don't say it.
Sometimes they're just thinking it, but when I hear that, I just wanna shake them 'cause how can you not believe in miracles and magic when they're happening all around us every single day?
There's a miracle out there just waiting for Bill.
I just have to go out there and find it.
( sniffles ) I really hope you do.
- All right.
- It's okay.
Good night.
It's morning.
'Course it is.
When I marry, Father, it will be for love.
I'm sorry, son, but you're a man now.
It's time for you to take a wife.
You will marry Caroline Shelby, the neighbor's daughter.
But they've only just moved here.
I haven't even met her yet.
- William--
- I was gonna go to California.
I wanted to see the world.
The Shelbys are a good family and it's important.
- Father, please--
- I'm dying, William.
You will marry Caroline Shelby, not for me, but for your mother.
This way, you see, our lands will combine so she won't have to worry how to get by when I'm gone.
Very well, sir.
I will meet her.
She's just back from finishing school.
I'm sure you'll find her to your liking.
I have met her, William.
She's quite comely.
Hoyt:
This is about the only place in town you can get a decent breakfast.
I thought you said it was called Merlotte's.
It is.
No, it's not.
Look.
Well, I'll be.
Huh.
( music playing )
We got customers, Big John!
And I'm ready for them.
Shi-it.
Welcome to Bellefleur's.
Thank you.
Hoyt?
Arlene.
Oh, my-- oh, sugar, I am so sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
And I'm-- I'm so sorry about Terry.
- Yeah, life is precious.
- Yes, it is.
- Mm.
- Yeah.
Oh, Arlene, this is my girlfriend Brigette.
Nice to meet you, Miss Bardot.
Oh, you are too sweet.
I'm really not.
Well, it's nice to meet you, too.
I didn't know you took the place over.
Yeah, like five months ago, I think it was.
Yeah, business was booming until the H-vamps came.
Did y'all have any problems with them up in Alaska?
Not yet.
We've only been spared because it just about never gets dark where we live this time of year.
I never thought of that.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Brigette's super smart.
We met on the job.
She's a microbiologist.
- Hoyt, stop.
- But she don't like attention, though.
- Ooh.
- Listen, I am starving.
Oh, of course.
Let me get you some menus.
Sit wherever you want.
Can I get y'all something to drink while you decide?
Coffee for me, hot tea for Brigette, and we're in a little bit of a hurry.
I gotta get to the police station to talk to Officer...
Stackhouse.
You mean Jason.
I didn't get a first name.
Just Stackhouse.
- ( cell phone ringing ) - ( music blaring in headphones )
- ( ringing continues ) - ( music and vacuum stop )
Yeah, Stackhouse.
Hoyt's here, Jason.
- What?
Hoyt?
He's where?
- At the BBG.
And he's acting like he doesn't even know you.
Yeah, that's 'cause he doesn't.
Listen, Arlene-
- Arlene, do not say anything to him, all right?
- I'm on my way.
- Okay.
So... should I use this on you?
Uh, how much does it say to use?
Um... it doesn't.
All it says is that its chief ingredient is horny goat weed and that it "invigorates and alleviating fatigue for a stress-reducing effect."
You wanna try something else, then?
Wade thinking:
Okay, just keep cool.
Be a man.
If she's into this stuff, then you gotta do whatever it takes to please your woman, even if you ain't into this at all.
- Oh, thank God!
- What?
You're not into this.
- Are-- are you?
- No.
Oh, my God.
Thank you.
No, Wade, thank you.
You have no idea how happy you just made me.
I just thought you wanted to experiment or something.
No, and I thought that you wanted to on account of you being so much more experienced than me.
Wait, what?
- I--
- What?
Listen, I'm not-- I'm not more experienced.
I mean, our first time was my first time.
Mine, too.
I really do love you, Wade Cleary.
I love you, too.

Mr. Fortenberry?

Yes, sir.
I'm Hoyt Fortenberry.
This is my girlfriend.
Brigette.
It's nice to meet you, too.
Though I'm sorry about the circumstances.
Well, uh... to be honest, you know, I try not to think about it.
- It just all seems so unreal.
- Hmm.
It'll probably feel more real once you go and see her.
- Hmm?
- Hoyt:
Yeah, I don't know if I'm--
I'm ready for all that yet, but... uh, you wanna join us for breakfast?
Hmm?
You wanna join us for breakfast?
Oh, uh, you guys finish up.
I'll just be waiting over at the bar.
Oh, no, don't be ridiculous.
No, please.

Dr. Ludwig, thank you for coming on such short notice.
- Where's the patient?
- At his house.
I would've had you meet me there, except with him being a vampire and all,
I thought this was safer.
Next time, save yourself some money and have me meet you where the patient is.
I fear nothing and no one and I have no natural enemies.
Well, where is he?
Um, across the cemetery.
( sarcastically ) Ooh, how very spooky.
A cemetery.
Shall we?
- ( music playing ) - ( chatter )
There she is.
- Where?
- Right over there with the Shelbys.
- William.
- Stewart.
- Claire.
- Margaret.
And you must be Caroline.
( chatter, laughter )
I have to admit, you're not what I was expecting.
What were you expecting?
Well, your daddy, only younger and just as--
Rotund?
( both laugh )
No, I take after my mother.
The truth be told, Caroline, you're not quite what I was expecting either.
Oh?
And what were you expecting?
My father described you as "comely."
Well, comely is a good thing.
I know it is, but that word is just so anachronistic that I suppose I thought you'd be--
Old and dowdy?
Formerly pretty, yes.
( laughs )
You feel their eyes on us as aggressively as I do?
Now that you mention it, I can feel all eight of their eyes searing a hole into the back of my head.
Would you care to take a walk with me?
I would.
Dr. Ludwig:
Mr. Compton.
Mr. Compton!
- Mr. Compton!
- Careful, he doesn't like to be woken.
Like I said, I fear nothing and no one.
- Mr. Compton!
- ( growls )
Remember me?
- Doctor?
- Ludwig.
Put your fangs away, son, and meet me in the parlor.
Mm-mm.
Nasty, nasty, nasty.
Whew.
Congratulations, Mr. Compton.
They said it could not be done, but you have thoroughly grossed me out.
Can you help him?
How many days ago do you believe you were infected?
Don't look to her.
I'm the one that asked you the question.
I gotta say, Dr. Ludwig,
I'm a little curious about your bedside manner.
Newsflash-- sometimes monogamy means one thing to hopelessly romantic blonde girls and something altogether different to their vampire lovers.
We are no longer lovers.
Are you sure she knows that?
He contracted the virus from me.
I was exposed through a cut in my arm.
He drank my blood, and he got sick pretty much right away.
I'm sorry, but that's not how this virus works.
Would it make any difference if we told you that Sookie was a halfling?
- Half what?
Half fae?
- Mm-hmm.
A few weeks ago, I was called to the home of a sick vampire in Monroe.
He had a not dissimilarly accelerated rate of infection.
Went from stage one to stage three in 10 days.
I was perplexed until he revealed to me that his boyfriend is a Hep-V positive fairy.
He was no halfling, mind you.
He was the real deal.
And even so, he didn't look anywhere near as bad as Mr. Compton does.
Do you happen to know the name of your line?
- My line?
- Come on, missy.
Your fairy line, your lineage.
I don't know.
I don't know the name.
I guess I could ask Niall.
Niall Brigant?
Yeah, do you know him?
Are you related to Niall Brigant?
Yeah, he's my great-great- great-times-a-thousand-grandfather.
- Why?
- ( panting )
I'm so fuckin' outta here.
- Dr. Ludwig?
- I'll show myself out.
God damn it, Stackhouse.
Get your fuckin' eyes off her.
I should've been here.
Maybe I could've saved her or at least just-- just been here for her when it happened or something.
Hey, babe.
You can't blame yourself.
And I'm sure if she were here right now, your mama would tell you the same thing.
Hoyt:
No, she wouldn't.
If she were here right now, she'd lay it on thick.
God, what I wouldn't give for one more guilt trip.
( crying )
- ( mouths words )
- Huh?
( mouthing words )
( quietly ) Shit.
Hi.
Did you know Maxine?
Um, yeah-- yeah, a little.
Good.
I think he needs to talk to somebody who knew her.
Do you think you could just go and talk to him, maybe?
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
( sniffles )
Uh...
I know it's hard, Mr. Fortenberry.
- How'd it happen?
- Huh?
How'd she die?
Um, well, you remember Vince McNeil?
- The orthodontist?
- Yeah.
Yeah, that's him.
Um... well, when the shit hit the fan at the BBG last week,
Mr. McNeil, he... got a bunch of the townsfolk all riled up, and together they took the law into their own hands.
Was my mama one of them?
No, that-- no.
No, she was not.
She-- she was one of the good folks.
Did you get the son of a bitch that did it to her?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Yeah, I sure did.
Thank you, man.
Grandpa Niall?
( wind blowing )
You know I've been in a lot of situations lately.
I had plenty of good reasons to call on a fairy godfather, but I didn't... until now... 'cause I like to think of myself as strong.
But I ain't this strong.
If you're listening, Grandpa Niall,
I need you to materialize right here, right now.
( wind gusting )
You know what?
Fuck this.
( clatters )
Jesus Christ.
Niall.
Hi.
How do you make that wonderful spaghetti?
This is so good.
- Can we go now?
- No.
Food first.
One mustn't forget to nourish oneself.
Please, I don't know how much time he has left.
I understand, but if this munchkin doctor doesn't know how to heal him, what can I do?
You were watching?
I'm always watching you.
Do you know why she was so afraid of you, then?
We are royalty.
Dwarves have an innate fear of us.
Maybe because we killed so many of them in the past.
I just realized that if you're always watching... did you know I was infecting Bill when he was feeding off of me?
I did.
Why would you let me do that?
I don't like him.
You don't have to like him.
You're doing something for me.
What I meant was I don't like him for you.
Grandpa Niall, you say we're royalty, but other than the vampire-killing light ball that I can only use once, by the way,
I can't think of a single fuckin' = advantage in being what we are.
If you say that we're so fuckin' special,
I am asking you...
I'm begging you... prove it.
Use some of your magic for me.
Fine, Sookie.
I'll try.

No.
You're not real.

( beeping )
( speaks Japanese )
( speaks Japanese )
You know how on the news you see these-- these places get wiped out by tornados, but the people who live there are always vowing to rebuild on the exact same spot where tragedy took away everything they had?
I do.
Am I as crazy as they are?
I mean, is Nicole right?
Is this whole town crazy?
'Cause I love her and I wanna be a father to my baby girl, but... this ultimatum's got me.
Why can't I wrap my head around leaving this place?
I mean, at what point does the guy whose house keeps getting hit by a tornado call it a day, take his family, move someplace else?
I can't answer that for you, Sam.
Let me ask you a question.
Better pour me another one first.
I know you, Sam.
I know you better than I think you think I do, and so I know that you've spent your whole life running away from things.
Bon Temps's the only place you actually stopped and stuck it out.
I ain't heard a question yet.
If you left... do you think it would feel more like you were running from something or to something?
Let me put it another way.
If you stayed... could you be happy here without them?
When you can answer the question, you'll know what to do.
Are you happy here, Arlene?
I mean, with everything that's going on and--
I fake it.
See, my hope is the more I fake it, the more I'll believe it until the happiness becomes real.
But, no, Sam, I ain't happy.
But there ain't a chance in hell I'm gonna stop trying to be.
Bon Temps's where my life is.
Everyone I know and love is here.
( knocks ) Adilyn, it's Daddy.
- Wade?
- Okay, here.
I think I got keys in here somewhere.
What, he never changed the locks?
I'm guessing no.
See, even though he hates me, he's as lazy as shit.
What'd I tell you?
Hey, kids, if y'all aren't wearing any clothes, you better put some on 'cause we're coming in.
Wade, honey?
Wade?
Adilyn?
( sighs )
Shit.
Holly:
Where are they?
I mean, there's only so many places they could've gone.
Does Adilyn have any friends or family on her mama's side that she could've gone to?
I don't know, some kind of fairy hangout or something?
Andy?
Baby, you crying, baby?
Something about how peaceful this lake looks, I guess, compared to this fucked-up reality we live in.
- I don't know.
- Oh, okay.
Hey, just take a breath.
- Just breathe.
Oh, baby.
- ( crying )
First you and then it's my baby girl, and I--
( mouths words )
I'm trying to run around, keep y'all safe all the time.
I can't do it no more, Holly.
I'm sorry.
I know.
Oh, honey... of course you can't.
You're just a person.
It was bad enough that I wasn't there that night they took you, but now this-- now this is all on me.
- No.
- Yeah, Adilyn ran away, and that's all 'cause of me.
Hey, hey, that is not true, okay?
And we're gonna get her back.
I know it.
How?
Listen, Andy, I know you love me for a lot of reasons, and I know that my being a Wiccan ain't high up there on that list, but do you believe I'm an intuitive person?
Yeah.
Then you listen to me, Sheriff.
This story's gonna have a happy ending for us, okay?
I know it.
I promise it.

Bill is inside the house.
How is channeling nature's memory gonna help?
History teaches us great lessons.
We need to look to it, find some answers.
Give me your hands.
( woman wailing )
( wailing continues )
Now, she will pull through, William.
( groaning, yelling )
- ( baby crying )
- Nurse:
Mr. Compton, please come in.
Nurse:
Congratulations, Mr. Compton.
Hi, sweetheart.
She's perfect.
( crying continues )
Wow.
Wow, what?
Didn't you think that was amazing?
I... guess?
Bill's wife gave birth.
So what?
"So what"?
Was I not clear before?
'Cause I thought I made myself perfectly clear when I said I was looking for a miracle.
- That was a miracle.
- Babies are born all the time.
That doesn't make it less miraculous.
There's magic in the ordinary, Sook.
There's magic in the things we can see.
Birth is a miracle.
Love is a miracle.
Death is a miracle.
Forgiveness is a miracle, especially if you can learn to forgive yourself.
Did you bring me here to Bill's house... just to trick me?
No, sweet orphan.
I brought you here because I wanted to give you some advice.
There are some things that can be fixed with magic.
But your vampire friend is not one of them.
I'm sorry.
Thank you for the life lesson.
Can you go now, please?

I mean, y'all are the only two men I've ever slept with,
- so can you please just go away?
!
- Ha!
Only two?
Oh, come on, Sarah.
Don't play me for a fool.
We both know that you fornicated with Jason Stackhouse in the balcony of the church that you and I built.
I'm no fool either, Sarah.
You lied to me.
You misled me.
I lost my head because of you.
( chuckles ) That's funny.
So did he.
( Sarah cries out )
Oh, my God.
Come on, Sarah.
You fornicated with him, too, didn't ya?
That makes four.
Why are you here?
I'm here because you're gonna die tonight, Sarah.
I'm here to give you a choice between heaven and hell because there's still time to save your soul.
There is no heaven, Noomi.
There is only the now and nothingness.
Nothingness?
What is nothingness?
I don't know what nothingness is!
Which is why Christianity is a way better deal!
Sarah:
No.
If you choose Jesus, your meeting with the Heavenly Father which takes place in the Risen Christ through the communion of the Holy Spirit awaits!
Follow the path, Noomi.
Die a Buddhist.
Fuck the path, Sarah.
Die a Christian.
Buddhist!
- Christian!
- Buddhist!
I choose neither!
I choose me!
I am the cure!
I am the messiah!
- I choose myself.
- ( laughs )
That's a bad fuckin' call right there, Sarah.
You never could stand on your own two feet.
( cars approaching )
( gasps ) What was that?
What, you need me to spell it out for ya?
That's death coming for ya.

Did your sister come to see you, Amber?
Amber, answer the fuckin' question!
She's not gonna tell us anything.
Well, maybe it's 'cause you're not asking the questions right.
What's the matter, sugar, do those chains hurt?
"Sugar"?
He's right.
I ain't telling' y'all shit.
Maybe you're both asking the question wrong.
- May I?
- Go ahead.
Hello, Amber.
My name's Mr. Gus.
Now, Mr. Northman and Ms. De Beaufort tell me that your sister was paying you to remain in hiding.
Is that correct?
So then would you say money is a primary motivator for you?
Because, Amber, if we are correct in assuming that your sister's in possession of an antidote for this virus, it could mean a lot of money for all of us.
Did Sarah come to see you?
Her name is not Sarah.
It's Noomi, and she is a good person.
Yeah, a good person who created a virus that's killing off every single vampire on the planet.
Except now she's the cure.
Did you just say Sarah is the cure?
Now, your sister may have healed you, but she is killing me.
She killed Jeremy.
You loved Jeremy.
- May I?
- She's all yours.
And Jeremy loved you.
You were happy together.
But then your sister--
Sarah or Noomi or whatever you want to call her-- she set fire to that happiness.
She killed him.
Stop it.
Time's wasting, Amber.
Tell us where she is.
I can't.
She saved me.
Well, stop trying to save her.
Fuck you!
She's my sister.
No.
Eric.

No one's here.
You recognize this truck?
Yes, it's Brian's.
Brian?
Who's Brian?
Wade and Rocky's father, my ex-husband.
Well, they should be here, then.
Adilyn!
Wade, honey, if you're here, come on out.
With your hands up where I can see them.
You don't have to be so dramatic.
- They didn't break any law.
- Like hell they didn't.
They're perverts and they're out here in violation of a parish-wide curfew.
Wade?
- What-- what are you doing?
- Calling her.
Even if they don't wanna answer, teenagers can have a Pavlovian response to a ringing cell phone.
Why is it happening so fast?
I don't know.
Is it because I'm fae?
I don't know.
It's mine.
-
- Are you gonna get it?
I ain't even sure I can stand up.
In that case, I'll get it.
No, I'll get it.
Sookie, please.
I'm not dead yet.
Hello?
Vampire Bill, it's Andy.
Is Jessica around?
Is that Andy?
Passing you over.
Andy, shit, I am so sorry.
I-
- I completely forgot about y'all.
Don't worry about it, Jessica.
We ain't even home.
Well, where are you?
Uh, Adilyn's had your blood, right?
Uh, yeah.
But I-
- Andy, I only did it because I--
So you'd feel her, right?
If-- if she were in danger, if anything bad happened to her?
Uh, yeah.
Well, have you felt her?
No, why?
You haven't?
Oh, well, that's great.
- Thank God.
- That's great.
Wait, Andy, what's happened?
Adilyn and Wade ran off together.
Oh, my God.
Do you need my help?
No, we're already out here looking for them.
Just, uh, do me a favor.
Promise me if you do feel her, give me a call, or even if you hear from her.
- Yeah, of course.
But, Andy?
- Yeah?
If you find them, will you call me?
You got it, Red.
Well, the good news is they're alive.
But where the fuck do we look now?
Brian has a lake house.
Shit, that's it.
Let's go.
Where is this lake house, anyhow?
Half hour north of Oklahoma City.
- Oklahoma?
- I know.
When we get there, I'm gonna hug them, but then I'm gonna kill them.
Here we are.
Home, sweet home.
Oh, my God.
- Wow.
- You like?
This is amazing.
Yeah, it's-- it's cool.
Wow.
Just breaks my heart that your parents don't support the love that you feel for each other.
Oh, and for what it's worth, when I was your age,
I used to fuck my brother, too.
A lot.
This way.
Okay.
So, there's a fully stocked fridge with snacks.
Sling is over there, nipple clamps on the bedside table with some erotic oils and handcuffs.
Dildos and toys are on the wall.
Oh, I got that strap-on in Zanzibar in the 19th century.
It was one of the first of its kind.
- What's--
- What's it for?
You sweet, sweet boy.
Your imagination's a muscle.
Use it or lose it.
Now I'm gonna go get some shut-eye.
You'll be safe here, and you can stay as long as you like.
- Are we cool?
- Totally.
Yeah.
- And, Violet?
- Hmm?
Thank you for everything.
Yeah, thanks.
Aw, you don't have to thank me.
I love love, and watching love flourish is all the thanks I need.
Have fun fucking.
Bill.
This isn't happening.
Yeah, Sookie, it is.
In your book you mentioned an experimental treatment in, um-- in India?
It's years away.
Gotta be something to slow this thing down.
Sookie, there's no cure.
I refuse to accept that.
Oh, my God!
I didn't mean to frighten you.
Well, you did.
Matter of fact, you scared the bejeezus outta me.
My apologies.
I know you've been through a great deal of suffering as of late and I should have known better than to sneak up on you.
Why did you, then?
Because, Arlene, it's still not safe for you to be out alone at night.
I came to see you home... to offer you my protection.
Well, just so long as you don't get the wrong idea, 'cause, to be honest, Keith, this is silly.
I mean, what are you, 25?
I'm 515 years old.
Look, you're very attractive, but I am not a fangbanger, okay?
I know who I am.
And a human with a vampire is just wrong.
You know?
Did that feel wrong?
Yes.
What about that?
That feel wrong?
Huh?
What are you doing?
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God, Oh, fu-uck.
You shouldn't have killed her.
She wasn't gonna cooperate anyway.
She was cooperating.
What do you want me to say, Pam?
I saw Sarah on that couch and I fucking lost it.
- Do you wanna die?
- I wanna kill Sarah Newlin.
That's why we came back, remember?
- No.
- No?
She's the antidote, Eric.
She can heal you.
This isn't about capture and kill anymore.
This is about capture and--
Capture and exploit.
You're a capitalist, yes?
I have a business proposition for you.
All right, we're listening.
Together we track down Miss Newlin, we capture her, and we synthesize her blood and we bottle it and distribute it worldwide as a product-
- New Blood.
Catchy.
Now, Yokonomo Corporation will retain controlling interest, of course, but you will own 49% of the company.
I only see one problem.
How the hell are we supposed to find her?
In Japan, business and government work together.
Now, when Tokyo hears about Miss Newlin's potential, we will have immediate access to all of her intelligence assets.
We will find her.
You don't need a partner.
I'm sorry, was that a question?
My word is oak.
Why do you need us?
New Blood will eradicate Hepatitis V from the planet.
Now, the only problem is the public has lost its trust in Yokonomo Corp.
They'll want proof that New Blood works, which means we'll need a vampire's testimonial for the advertising.
You want Eric to be your fuckin' spokesperson for your vampire Jenny Craig commercials?
Now, I ain't a homo, but you have to admit he is a handsome devil.
No.
Do you know what 49% of a three-and-a-half-billion- dollar-a-year company is?
I thought so.
Now, like I said, my word is oak.
What is your word worth?
- You have my word.
- Really?
'Cause I thought I had your word earlier tonight and then you hauled off and killed the sister.
You need me, right?
Well, then you're just gonna have to trust me.
I think I'm gonna stay up, watch him sleep.
I have a better idea.
Why don't you climb in with him?
You don't think that would be weird?
No, honey, I really don't.
And you need your rest, so, come on.
See?
It's not weird.
Sookie?
Yeah?
You said that you refuse to accept this.
But what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
But I meet people every day who say that they don't believe in miracles.
Sometimes they don't say it.
Sometimes they're just thinking it, but when I hear that, I just wanna shake them 'cause how can you not believe in miracles and magic when they're happening all around us every single day?
There's a miracle out there just waiting for Bill.
I just have to go out there and find it.
I really hope you do.
- All right.
- It's okay.
Good night.
It's morning.
'Course it is.
When I marry, Father, it will be for love.
I'm sorry, son, but you're a man now.
It's time for you to take a wife.
You will marry Caroline Shelby, the neighbor's daughter.
But they've only just moved here.
I haven't even met her yet.
- William--
- I was gonna go to California.
I wanted to see the world.
The Shelbys are a good family and it's important.
- Father, please--
- I'm dying, William.
You will marry Caroline Shelby, not for me, but for your mother.
This way, you see, our lands will combine so she won't have to worry how to get by when I'm gone.
Very well, sir.
I will meet her.
She's just back from finishing school.
I'm sure you'll find her to your liking.
I have met her, William.
She's quite comely.
This is about the only place in town you can get a decent breakfast.
I thought you said it was called Merlotte's.
It is.
No, it's not.
Look.
Well, I'll be.
Huh.
We got customers, Big John!
And I'm ready for them.
Shi-it.
Welcome to Bellefleur's.
Thank you.
Hoyt?
Arlene.
Oh, my-- oh, sugar, I am so sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
And I'm-- I'm so sorry about Terry.
- Yeah, life is precious.
- Yes, it is.
- Mm.
- Yeah.
Oh, Arlene, this is my girlfriend Brigette.
Nice to meet you, Miss Bardot.
Oh, you are too sweet.
I'm really not.
Well, it's nice to meet you, too.
I didn't know you took the place over.
Yeah, like five months ago, I think it was.
Yeah, business was booming until the H-vamps came.
Did y'all have any problems with them up in Alaska?
Not yet.
We've only been spared because it just about never gets dark where we live this time of year.
I never thought of that.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Brigette's super smart.
We met on the job.
She's a microbiologist.
- Hoyt, stop.
- But she don't like attention, though.
- Ooh.
- Listen, I am starving.
Oh, of course.
Let me get you some menus.
Sit wherever you want.
Can I get y'all something to drink while you decide?
Coffee for me, hot tea for Brigette, and we're in a little bit of a hurry.
I gotta get to the police station to talk to Officer...
Stackhouse.
You mean Jason.
I didn't get a first name.
Just Stackhouse.
Yeah, Stackhouse.
Hoyt's here, Jason.
- What?
Hoyt?
He's where?
- At the BBG.
And he's acting like he doesn't even know you.
Yeah, that's 'cause he doesn't.
Listen, Arlene-
- Arlene, do not say anything to him, all right?
- I'm on my way.
- Okay.
So... should I use this on you?
Uh, how much does it say to use?
Um... it doesn't.
All it says is that its chief ingredient is horny goat weed and that it "invigorates and alleviating fatigue for a stress-reducing effect."
You wanna try something else, then?
Okay, just keep cool.
Be a man.
If she's into this stuff, then you gotta do whatever it takes to please your woman, even if you ain't into this at all.
- Oh, thank God!
- What?
You're not into this.
- Are-- are you?
- No.
Oh, my God.
Thank you.
No, Wade, thank you.
You have no idea how happy you just made me.
I just thought you wanted to experiment or something.
No, and I thought that you wanted to on account of you being so much more experienced than me.
Wait, what?
- I--
- What?
Listen, I'm not-- I'm not more experienced.
I mean, our first time was my first time.
Mine, too.
I really do love you, Wade Cleary.
I love you, too.

Brigette.
It's nice to meet you, too.
Though I'm sorry about the circumstances.
Well, uh... to be honest, you know, I try not to think about it.
- It just all seems so unreal.
- Hmm.
It'll probably feel more real once you go and see her.
- Hmm?
- Yeah, I don't know if I'm--
I'm ready for all that yet, but... uh, you wanna join us for breakfast?
Hmm?
You wanna join us for breakfast?
Oh, uh, you guys finish up.

Dr. Ludwig, thank you for coming on such short notice.
- Where's the patient?
- At his house.
I would've had you meet me there, except with him being a vampire and all,
I thought this was safer.
Next time, save yourself some money and have me meet you where the patient is.
I fear nothing and no one and I have no natural enemies.
Well, where is he?
Um, across the cemetery.
Ooh, how very spooky.
A cemetery.
Shall we?
There she is.
- Where?
- Right over there with the Shelbys.
- William.
- Stewart.
- Claire.
- Margaret.
And you must be Caroline.
I have to admit, you're not what I was expecting.
What were you expecting?
Well, your daddy, only younger and just as--
Rotund?
No, I take after my mother.
The truth be told, Caroline, you're not quite what I was expecting either.
Oh?
And what were you expecting?
My father described you as "comely."
Well, comely is a good thing.
I know it is, but that word is just so anachronistic that I suppose I thought you'd be--
Old and dowdy?
Formerly pretty, yes.
You feel their eyes on us as aggressively as I do?
Now that you mention it, I can feel all eight of their eyes searing a hole into the back of my head.
Would you care to take a walk with me?
I would.
Mr. Compton.
Mr. Compton!
- Mr. Compton!
- Careful, he doesn't like to be woken.
Like I said, I fear nothing and no one.
Mr. Compton!
Remember me?
- Doctor?
- Ludwig.
Put your fangs away, son, and meet me in the parlor.
Mm-mm.
Nasty, nasty, nasty.
Whew.
Congratulations, Mr. Compton.
They said it could not be done, but you have thoroughly grossed me out.
Can you help him?
How many days ago do you believe you were infected?
Don't look to her.
I'm the one that asked you the question.
I gotta say, Dr. Ludwig,
I'm a little curious about your bedside manner.
Newsflash-- sometimes monogamy means one thing to hopelessly romantic blonde girls and something altogether different to their vampire lovers.
We are no longer lovers.
Are you sure she knows that?
He contracted the virus from me.
I was exposed through a cut in my arm.
He drank my blood, and he got sick pretty much right away.
I'm sorry, but that's not how this virus works.
Would it make any difference if we told you that Sookie was a halfling?
- Half what?
Half fae?
- Mm-hmm.
A few weeks ago, I was called to the home of a sick vampire in Monroe.
He had a not dissimilarly accelerated rate of infection.
Went from stage one to stage three in 10 days.
I was perplexed until he revealed to me that his boyfriend is a Hep-V positive fairy.
He was no halfling, mind you.
He was the real deal.
And even so, he didn't look anywhere near as bad as Mr. Compton does.
Do you happen to know the name of your line?
- My line?
- Come on, missy.
Your fairy line, your lineage.
I don't know.
I don't know the name.
I guess I could ask Niall.
Niall Brigant?
Yeah, do you know him?
Are you related to Niall Brigant?
Yeah, he's my great-great- great-times-a-thousand-grandfather.
Why?
I'm so fuckin' outta here.
- Dr. Ludwig?
- I'll show myself out.
God damn it, Stackhouse.
Get your fuckin' eyes off her.
I should've been here.
Maybe I could've saved her or at least just-- just been here for her when it happened or something.
Hey, babe.
You can't blame yourself.
And I'm sure if she were here right now, your mama would tell you the same thing.
No, she wouldn't.
If she were here right now, she'd lay it on thick.
God, what I wouldn't give for one more guilt trip.
Huh?
Shit.
Hi.
Did you know Maxine?
Um, yeah-- yeah, a little.
Good.
I think he needs to talk to somebody who knew her.
Do you think you could just go and talk to him, maybe?
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
Uh...
I know it's hard, Mr. Fortenberry.
- How'd it happen?
- Huh?
How'd she die?
Um, well, you remember Vince McNeil?
- The orthodontist?
- Yeah.
Yeah, that's him.
Um... well, when the shit hit the fan at the BBG last week,
Mr. McNeil, he... got a bunch of the townsfolk all riled up, and together they took the law into their own hands.
Was my mama one of them?
No, that-- no.
No, she was not.
She-- she was one of the good folks.
Did you get the son of a bitch that did it to her?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Yeah, I sure did.
Thank you, man.
Grandpa Niall?
You know I've been in a lot of situations lately.
I had plenty of good reasons to call on a fairy godfather, but I didn't... until now... 'cause I like to think of myself as strong.
But I ain't this strong.
If you're listening, Grandpa Niall,
I need you to materialize right here, right now.
You know what?
Fuck this.
Jesus Christ.
Niall.
Hi.
How do you make that wonderful spaghetti?
This is so good.
- Can we go now?
- No.
Food first.
One mustn't forget to nourish oneself.
Please, I don't know how much time he has left.
I understand, but if this munchkin doctor doesn't know how to heal him, what can I do?
You were watching?
I'm always watching you.
Do you know why she was so afraid of you, then?
We are royalty.
Dwarves have an innate fear of us.
Maybe because we killed so many of them in the past.
I just realized that if you're always watching... did you know I was infecting Bill when he was feeding off of me?
I did.
Why would you let me do that?
I don't like him.
You don't have to like him.
You're doing something for me.
What I meant was I don't like him for you.
Grandpa Niall, you say we're royalty, but other than the vampire-killing light ball that I can only use once, by the way,
I can't think of a single fuckin' = advantage in being what we are.
If you say that we're so fuckin' special,
I am asking you...
I'm begging you... prove it.
Use some of your magic for me.
Fine, Sookie.

See, death comes for all of us, and your number's up.
No.
You're not real.
Maybe not, but death is.
Fuck off!
Yeah, I'll be sure to do that, then.
I'll see you in hell when I get there!
There is no hell.
You just try to convince yourself of that.
You don't even know--
Hold it together, Noomi.
You are one with the universe.
Keep it together.
Okay?
You know how on the news you see these-- these places get wiped out by tornados, but the people who live there are always vowing to rebuild on the exact same spot where tragedy took away everything they had?
I do.
Am I as crazy as they are?
I mean, is Nicole right?
Is this whole town crazy?
'Cause I love her and I wanna be a father to my baby girl, but... this ultimatum's got me.
Why can't I wrap my head around leaving this place?
I mean, at what point does the guy whose house keeps getting hit by a tornado call it a day, take his family, move someplace else?
I can't answer that for you, Sam.
Let me ask you a question.
Better pour me another one first.
I know you, Sam.
I know you better than I think you think I do, and so I know that you've spent your whole life running away from things.
Bon Temps's the only place you actually stopped and stuck it out.
I ain't heard a question yet.
If you left... do you think it would feel more like you were running from something or to something?
Let me put it another way.
If you stayed... could you be happy here without them?
When you can answer the question, you'll know what to do.
Are you happy here, Arlene?
I mean, with everything that's going on and--
I fake it.
See, my hope is the more I fake it, the more I'll believe it until the happiness becomes real.
But, no, Sam, I ain't happy.
But there ain't a chance in hell I'm gonna stop trying to be.
Bon Temps's where my life is.
Everyone I know and love is here.
Adilyn, it's Daddy.
- Wade?
- Okay, here.
I think I got keys in here somewhere.
What, he never changed the locks?
I'm guessing no.
See, even though he hates me, he's as lazy as shit.
What'd I tell you?
Hey, kids, if y'all aren't wearing any clothes, you better put some on 'cause we're coming in.
Wade, honey?
Wade?
Adilyn?
Shit.
Where are they?
I mean, there's only so many places they could've gone.
Does Adilyn have any friends or family on her mama's side that she could've gone to?
I don't know, some kind of fairy hangout or something?
Andy?
Baby, you crying, baby?
Something about how peaceful this lake looks, I guess, compared to this fucked-up reality we live in.
- I don't know.
- Oh, okay.
Hey, just take a breath.
Just breathe.
Oh, baby.
First you and then it's my baby girl, and I--
I'm trying to run around, keep y'all safe all the time.
I can't do it no more, Holly.
I'm sorry.
I know.
Oh, honey... of course you can't.
You're just a person.
It was bad enough that I wasn't there that night they took you, but now this-- now this is all on me.
- No.
- Yeah, Adilyn ran away, and that's all 'cause of me.
Hey, hey, that is not true, okay?
And we're gonna get her back.
I know it.
How?
Listen, Andy, I know you love me for a lot of reasons, and I know that my being a Wiccan ain't high up there on that list, but do you believe I'm an intuitive person?
Yeah.
Then you listen to me, Sheriff.
This story's gonna have a happy ending for us, okay?
I know it.
I promise it.
Are you kidding me?
Grandpa!
What's wrong?
We need to channel nature's memory here.
May I ask to what end?
Bill is inside the house.
How is channeling nature's memory gonna help?
History teaches us great lessons.
We need to look to it, find some answers.
Give me your hands.
Now, she will pull through, William.
-
- Mr. Compton, please come in.
Congratulations, Mr. Compton.
Hi, sweetheart.
She's perfect.
Wow.
Wow, what?
Didn't you think that was amazing?
I... guess?
Bill's wife gave birth.
So what?
"So what"?
Was I not clear before?
'Cause I thought I made myself perfectly clear when I said I was looking for a miracle.
- That was a miracle.
- Babies are born all the time.
That doesn't make it less miraculous.
There's magic in the ordinary, Sook.
There's magic in the things we can see.
Birth is a miracle.
Love is a miracle.
Death is a miracle.
Forgiveness is a miracle, especially if you can learn to forgive yourself.
Did you bring me here to Bill's house... just to trick me?
No, sweet orphan.
I brought you here because I wanted to give you some advice.
There are some things that can be fixed with magic.
But your vampire friend is not one of them.
I'm sorry.
Thank you for the life lesson.
Can you go now, please?

Oh, come on, Sarah.
Don't play me for a fool.
We both know that you fornicated with Jason Stackhouse in the balcony of the church that you and I built.
I'm no fool either, Sarah.
You lied to me.
You misled me.
I lost my head because of you.
That's funny.
So did he.
Oh, my God.
Come on, Sarah.
You fornicated with him, too, didn't ya?
That makes four.
Why are you here?
I'm here because you're gonna die tonight, Sarah.
I'm here to give you a choice between heaven and hell because there's still time to save your soul.
There is no heaven, Noomi.
There is only the now and nothingness.
Nothingness?
What is nothingness?
I don't know what nothingness is!
Which is why Christianity is a way better deal!
No.
If you choose Jesus, your meeting with the Heavenly Father which takes place in the Risen Christ through the communion of the Holy Spirit awaits!
Follow the path, Noomi.
Die a Buddhist.
Fuck the path, Sarah.
Die a Christian.
Buddhist!
- Christian!
- Buddhist!
I choose neither!
I choose me!
I am the cure!
I am the messiah!
I choose myself.
That's a bad fuckin' call right there, Sarah.
You never could stand on your own two feet.
What was that?
What, you need me to spell it out for ya?
That's death coming for ya.

Did your sister come to see you, Amber?
Amber, answer the fucking question!
She's not gonna tell us anything.
Well, maybe it's because you're not asking the questions right.
What's the matter, sugar, do those chains hurt?
"Sugar"?
He's right.
- I ain't telling y'all shit.
- Hmm.
Maybe you're both asking the question wrong.
- May I?
ERIC:
Go ahead.
Hello, Amber.
My name's Mr. Gus.
Mr. Northman and Ms. De Beaufort tell me your sister was paying you to remain in hiding.
Is that correct?
So then would you say money is a primary motivator for you?
Because, Amber, if we are correct in assuming that your sister's in possession of an antidote for this virus it could mean a lot of money for all of us.
Did Sarah come to see you?
Her name is not Sarah.
It's Noomi and she is a good person.
ERIC:
Yeah, a good person who created a virus that's killing off every single vampire on the planet.
Except now she's the cure.
Did you just say Sarah is the cure?
ERIC:
Now, your sister may have healed you but she is killing me.
She killed Jeremy.
You loved Jeremy.
- May I?
GUS:
She's all yours.
And Jeremy loved you.
You were happy together.
But then your sister Sarah or Noomi or whatever you want to call her she set fire to that happiness.
She killed him.
Stop it.
PAM:
Time's wasting, Amber.
Tell us where she is.
AMBER:
I can't.
She saved me.
ERIC:
Well, stop trying to save her.
Fuck you.
[IN DISTORTED VOICE] She's my sister.
[ERIC GROWLS THEN AMBER SCREAMS]
Huh.
Oh, no.
[IN JAPANESE]
Fuck!
[GROWLING]
Eric.
No one's here.
You recognize this truck?
- Yes, it's Brian's.
- Brian?
Who's Brian?
Wade and Rocky's father, my ex-husband.
Well, they should be here, then.
Adilyn!
Wade, honey, if you're here, come on out.
With your hands up where I can see them.
You don't have to be so dramatic.
- They didn't break any law.
- Like hell, they didn't.
They're perverts and they're out here in violation of a parish-wide curfew.
Wade?
What--?
What are you doing?
Calling her.
Even if they don't wanna answer teenagers can have a Pavlovian response to a ringing cell phone.
[POP MUSIC RINGTONE PLAYING]
SOOKIE:
Why is it happening so fast?
I don't know.
Is it because I'm fae?
I don't know.
[PHONE RINGING]
It's mine.
Are you gonna get it?
I ain't even sure I can stand up.
- In that case, I'll get it.
- No, I'll get it.
Sookie, please.
I'm not dead yet.
[RINGING CONTINUES]
- Hello?
- Vampire Bill, it's Andy.
Is Jessica around?
- Is that Andy?
- Passing you over.
Andy, shit, I am so sorry.
I completely forgot about y'all.
Don't worry about it, Jessica.
We ain't even at home.
Well, where are you?
Adilyn's had your blood, right?
Yeah.
But I-- Andy, I only did it because I--
So you'd feel her, right?
If she were in danger...
-...if anything bad happened to her?
- Uh...
Uh, yeah.
Well, have you felt her?
No, why?
You haven't?
Oh.
- Well, that's great.
That's great.
- Wait, Andy, what's happened?
Adilyn and Wade ran off together.
- Oh, my God.
Do you need my help?
- No, we're already out here looking for them.
Just do me a favor.
Promise me if you do feel her give me a call, or even if you hear from her.
- Yeah, of course.
But, Andy?
- Yeah?
If you find them, will you call me?
You got it, Red.
Well, the good news is they're alive.
But where the fuck do we look now?
Brian has a lake house.
Shit, that's it.
Let's go.
Where is this lake house, anyhow?
Half hour north of Oklahoma City.
- Oklahoma?
- I know.
When we get there, I'm gonna hug them, but then I'm gonna kill them.
VIOLET:
Here we are.
Home, sweet home.
Oh, my God.
Wow.
- You like?
- This is amazing.
- Yeah, it's-
- It's cool.
- Wow.
VIOLET:
Just breaks my heart that your parents don't support the love that you feel for each other.
Oh, and for what it's worth when I was your age, I used to fuck my brother too.
A lot.
Tsk.
This way.
Okay.
So there's a fully-stocked fridge with snacks.
Sling is over there, nipple clamps on the bedside table with some erotic oils and handcuffs.
Dildos and toys are on the wall.
Oh, I got that strap-on in Zanzibar in the 19th century.
It was one of the first of its kind.
- What's it--?
- What's it for?
[CHUCKLES]
You sweet, sweet boy.
Your imagination's a muscle.
Use it or lose it.
[CHUCKLES]
Now, I'm gonna go get some shut-eye.
You'll be safe here, and you can stay as long as you like.
- Are we cool?
- Totally.
Yeah.
- And, Violet?
- Hm?
Thank you for everything.
Yeah, thanks.
You don't have to thank me.
I love love, and watching love flourish is all the thanks I need.
[BOTH LAUGH]
VIOLET:
Have fun fucking.
Bill.
This isn't happening.
BILL:
Yeah, Sookie, it is.
In your book you mentioned an experimental treatment in India?
- It's years away.
- Gotta be something to slow this thing down.
Sookie, there's no cure.
I refuse to accept that.
Ah!
Oh, my God.
- I didn't mean to frighten you.
- Well, you did.
Matter of fact, you scared the bejesus out of me.
My apologies.
I know you've been through a great deal of suffering...
-...
I should've known better than to sneak up.
- Why did you, then?
Because, Arlene, it's still not safe for you to be out alone at night.
I came to see you home.
To offer you my protection.
Well, just so long as you don't get the wrong idea because, to be honest, Keith, this is silly.
I mean, what are you, 25?
I'm 515 years old.
Look, you're very attractive, but I am not a fangbanger, okay?
I know who I am.
And a human with a vampire is just wrong.
You know?
Did that feel wrong?
Yes.
What about that?
That feel wrong?
Huh?
Mm.

[TALKING INDISTINCTLY]
You shouldn't have killed her.
She wasn't gonna cooperate anyway.
She was cooperating.
What do you want me to say, Pam?
I saw Sarah on that couch and I fucking lost it.
- Do you wanna die?
- I wanna kill Sarah Newlin.
- That's why we came back, remember?
- No.
- No?
- She's the antidote, Eric.
She can heal you.
This isn't about capture and kill anymore.
- This is about capture and-- -[IN ENGLISH] Capture and exploit.
You're a capitalist, yes?
I have a business proposition for you.
All right, we're listenin.
Together we track down Ms. Newlin we capture her and we synthesize her blood and we bottle it and distribute it worldwide as a product:
New Blood.
Catchy.
Yakonomo Corporation will retain controlling interest, of course but you will own 49 percent of the company.
I only see one problem.
How the hell are we supposed to find her?
In Japan, business and government work together.
Now, when Tokyo hears about Ms. Newlin's potential we will have immediate access to all of her intelligence assets.
We will find her.
You don't need a partner.
I'm sorry, was that a question?
My word is oak.
Why do you need us?
New Blood will eradicate Hepatitis V from the planet.
Now, the only problem is the public has lost its trust in Yakonomo Corp.
They'll want proof that New Blood works which means we'll need a vampire's testimonial for the advertising.
You want Eric to be your fucking spokesperson for your vampire Jenny Craig commercials?
Now, I ain't a homo but you have to admit he is a handsome devil.
No.
Do you know what 49 percent of a 3-and-a-half-billion- dollar-a-year company is?
I thought so.
Now, like I said, my word is oak.
What is your word worth?
- You have my word.
- Really?
I thought I had your word earlier...
-...and then you hauled off and killed the sister.
- You need me, right?
Well, then you're just gonna have to trust me.
JESSICA:
I think I'm gonna stay up watch him sleep.
I have a better idea.
Why don't you climb in with him?
- You don't think that would be weird?
- No, honey, I really don't.
And you need your rest, so come on.
See?
It's not weird.
JESSICA:
Sookie?
SOOKIE:
Yeah?
You said that you refuse to accept this.
But what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
But I meet people every day who say that they don't believe in miracles.
Sometimes they don't say it.
Sometimes they're just thinking it but when I hear that I just wanna shake them because how can you not believe in miracles and magic when they're happening all around us every single day?
There's a miracle out there just waiting for Bill.
I just have to go out there and find it.
I really hope you do.
- All right.
- It's okay.
Good night.
JESSICA:
It's morning.
SOOKIE:
Of course it is.
[DOOR CLOSES]
When I marry, Father, it will be for love.
I'm sorry, son, but you're a man now.
It's time for you to take a wife.
You will marry Carolin Shelby, the neighbor's daughter.
They've just moved here.
I haven't met her.
- William--
- I was gonna go to California.
- I wanted to see the world.
- The Shelbys are a good family, it's important.
- Father, please--
- I'm dying, William.
You will marry Carolin Shelby not for me, but for your mother.
This way, you see, our lands will combine so she won't have to worry how to get by when I'm gone.
Very well, sir.
I will meet her.
She's just back from finishing school.
I'm sure you'll find her to your liking.
I have met her, William.
She's quite comely.
MAN:
This is about the only place in town you can get a decent breakfast.
- I thought you said it was called Merlotte's.
- It is.
No, it's not.
Look.
Well, I'll be.
Huh.
- We got customers, Big John.
- And I'm ready for them.
Shit.
Welcome to Bellefleur's.
Thank you.
Hoyt?
Arlene.
Oh, my--
Oh, sugar, I am so sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
And I'm, uh--
I'm so sorry about Terry.
- Yeah, life is precious.
- Yes, it is.
- Mm-hm.
- Yeah.
Oh, Arlene this is my girlfriend, Brigette.
Nice to meet you, Ms. Bardot.
Oh, you are too sweet.
I'm really not.
Well, it's nice to meet you too.
I didn't know you took the place over.
Yeah, like five months ago, I think it was.
Yeah, business was booming until the H-vamps came.
Did y'all have any problems with them up in Alaska?
- Not yet.
- We've only been spared because it just about never gets dark where we live this time of year.
I never thought of that.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Brigette's super smart.
We met on the job.
She's a microbiologist.
- Hoyt, stop.
- But she don't like attention, though.
- Ooh.
- Listen, I am starving.
Oh, of course.
Let me get you some menus.
Sit wherever you want.
Can I get y'all something to drink while you decide?
Coffee for me.
Uh-
- Hot tea for Brigette.
And we're in a little bit of a hurry.
I gotta get to the police station to talk to Officer...
Stackhouse.
You mean Jason.
I didn't get a first name.
Just Stackhouse.
[CHUCKLES]
[VACUUM WHIRRING AND UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING OVER EARPHONES]
[PHONE RINGING]
[WHIRRING STOPS]
Yeah, Stackhouse.
Hoyt's here, Jason.
- What?
Hoyt?
He's where?
- At the BBG.
- He's acting like he doesn't even know you.
- Yeah, that's because he doesn't.
Listen, Arlene, do not say anything to him, all right?
- I'm on my way.
- Okay.
So...
-...should I use this on you?
- Uh...
How much does it say to use?
Um...
It doesn't.
All it says is that its chief ingredient is horny goat weed.
It "Invigorates the sensory nerves while restoring the adrenals and alleviating fatigue for a stress-reducing effect."
You wanna try something else, then?
WADE:
Okay, just keep cool.
Be a man.
If she's into this stuff, you gotta do whatever it takes to please your woman, even if you ain't into this at all.
- Oh, thank God.
- What?
You're not into this.
- Are you?
- No.
Oh, my God.
Thank you.
No, thank you.
You have no idea how happy you just made me.
I thought you wanted to experiment.
No, and I thought that you wanted to on account of you being...
-...so much more experienced than me.
- Wait, what?
- What?
- Listen, I'm--
I'm not more experienced.
I mean our first time was my first time.
Mine too.
I really do love you, Wade Cleary.
I love you too.

It's nice to meet you too.
Though I'm sorry about the circumstances.
Well, uh to be honest, ahem, you know I try not to think about it.
It just all seems so unreal.
- Hmm.
- It'll probably feel more real once you go and see her.
Hmm?
HOYT:
Yeah, I don't know if I'm ready for all that yet, but...
You wanna join us for breakfast?
- Hmm?
- You wanna join us for breakfast?
Oh, you guys finish up.
I'll just...

- No, don't be ridiculous.
No, please.

Dr. Ludwig, thank you for coming on such short notice.
- Where's the patient?
- At his house.
I would've had you meet me there with him being a vampire, I thought this was safer.
Next time, save yourself some money and have me meet you where the patient is.
I fear nothing and no one, and I have no natural enemies.
Well, where is he?
Across the cemetery.
Ooh.
How very spooky.
A cemetery.
Shall we?
[CHATTERING]
There she is.
- Where?
WILLIAM:
Right over there with the Shelbys.
William.
- Stewart.
- Claire.
Margaret.
And you must be Caroline.
CAROLINE:
I have to admit you're not what I was expecting.
What were you expecting?
Well, your daddy.
Only younger...
-...and just as--
- Rotund?
[BOTH LAUGH]
No, I take after my mother.
The truth be told, Caroline, you're not quite what I was expecting either.
Oh?
And what were you expecting?
My father described you as "comely."
- Well, comely is a good thing.
- I know it is but that word is just so anachronistic...
-...that I suppose I thought you'd be--
- Old and dowdy?
Formerly pretty, yes.
[LAUGHS]
You feel their eyes on us as aggressively as I do?
Now that you mention it, I can feel all eight of their eyes searing a hole into the back of my head.
[BILL CHUCKLES]

Would you care to take a walk with me?
I would.
LUDWIG:
Mr. Compton.
Mr. Compton.
- Mr. Compton.
- Careful, he doesn't like to be woken.
Like I said, I fear nothing and no one.
Mr. Compton!
[HISSES]
Remember me?
- Doctor?
- Ludwig.
Put your fangs away, son, and meet me in the parlor.
Mm-mm.
Nasty, nasty, nasty.
Congratulations, Mr. Compton.
They said it could not be done, but you have thoroughly grossed me out.
Can you help him?
How many days ago do you believe you were infected?
Don't look to her.
I'm the one that asked you the question.
I gotta say, Dr. Ludwig, I'm a little curious about your bedside manner.
LUDWIG:
Newsflash.
Sometimes monogamy means one thing to hopelessly romantic blond girls and something altogether different to their vampire lovers.
We are no longer lovers.
- Are you sure she knows that?
- He contracted the virus from me.
I was exposed through a cut in my arm.
He drank my blood and got sick pretty much right away.
I'm sorry, but that's not how this virus works.
Would it make any difference if Sookie was a halfling?
Half what?
- Half fae?
SOOKIE:
Mm-hm.
A few weeks ago, I was called to the home of a sick vampire in Monroe.
He had a not dissimilarly accelerated rate of infection.
Went from stage one to stage three in 10 days.
I was perplexed until he revealed to me that his boyfriend was a Hep-V positive fairy.
He was no halfling, mind you.
He was the real deal.
And even so, he didn't look anywhere near as bad as Mr. Compton does.
Do you happen to know the name of your line?
- My line?
- Come on, missy.
Your fairy line.
- Your lineage.
- I don't know.
I don't know the name.
I guess I could ask Niall.
Niall Brigant?
Yeah, do you know him?
Are you related to Niall Brigant?
Yeah, he's my great-great-great- times-a-thousand-grandfather.
Why?
I'm so fucking out of here.
- Dr. Ludwig?
- I'll show myself out.
Goddamn it, Stackhouse.
Get your fucking eyes off her.
I should've been here.
Maybe I could've saved her.
At least just--
Just been here for her when it happened or something.
BRIGETTE:
Hey.
You can't blame yourself.
And I'm sure if she were here right now, your mama would tell you the same thing.
No, she wouldn't.
If she were here right now, she'd lay it on thick.
God, what I wouldn't give for one more guilt trip.
[HOYT CRYING]
-[MOUTHING] Hey.
- Huh?
Can you come in here, please?
[SOFTLY] Shit.
[WHISPERS] Hi.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] Did you know Maxine?
Um-
- Yeah, yeah, a little.
Good.
I think he needs to talk to somebody who knew her.
Do you think you could just go and talk to him, maybe?
Yeah.
Thank you.
[SNIFFLING]
Uh...
I know it's hard, Mr. Fortenberry.
How'd it happen?
- Huh?
- How'd she die?
Um...
Well, you remember Vince McNeil?
- He's the orthodontist?
- Yeah.
Yeah, that's him.
Um...
Well, when the shit hit the fan at the BBG last week Mr. McNeil he got a bunch of the townsfolk all riled up and together they took the law into their own hands.
Was my mama one of them?
No, that--
No.
No, she was not.
She was one of the good folks.
Did you get the son of a bitch that did it to her?
Mm-hm.
Yeah.
Yeah, I sure did.
Thank you, man.
Grandpa Niall?
You know I've been in a lot of situations lately.
I had plenty of good reasons to call on a fairy godfather but I didn't.
Until now because I like to think of myself as strong.
But I ain't this strong.
If you're listening, Grandpa Niall I need you to materialize right here right now.
[WIND WHISTLING]
Oh.
You know what?
Fuck this.
[DOOR HANDLE RATTLING]
[OBJECTS CLATTERING]
Jesus Christ.
- Niall.
- Hi.
How do you make that wonderful spaghetti?
This is so good.
- Can we go now?
- No.
Food first.
- One mustn't forget to nourish oneself.
- Please.
- I don't know how much time he has left.
- I understand but if this munchkin doctor doesn't know how to heal him what can I do?
You were watching?
I'm always watching you.
Do you know why she was so afraid of you, then?
We are royalty.
Dwarves have an innate fear of us.
Maybe because we killed so many of them in the past.
I just realized that if you're always watching did you know I was infecting Bill when he was feeding off of me?
I did.
Why would you let me do that?
- I don't like him.
- You don't have to like him.
You're doing something for me.
What I meant was I don't like him for you.
[SNIFFLES]
Grandpa Niall you say we're royalty but other than the vampire-killing light ball that I can only use once, by the way I can't think of a single fucking advantage in being what we are.
If you say that we're so fucking special I am asking you I'm begging you prove it.
Use some of your magic for me.
Fine, Sookie.
I'll try.

Over here.
- Oh.
Hey, Noomi.
- Oh, God, I'm so glad you're here.
I feel so alone.
Oh.
Well, we all die alone.
What?
You're gonna die tonight.
See, Eric's coming for you, and there ain't no escaping it.
But I don't wanna die.
Ha-ha-ha.
Well, that's just too fucking bad.
See, death comes for all of us and your number's up.
No.
You're not real.
Maybe not, but death is.
- Fuck off.
- Yeah, I'll be sure to do that, then.
I'll see you in hell when I get there.
There is no hell.
[CHUCKLES]
You just try to convince yourself of that.
You don't even know--
Hold it together, Noomi.
You are one with the universe.
Keep it together.
MAN [IN JAPANESE]:
We've got her.
You can find another vampire.
You know how on the news you see these...
These places get wiped out by tornados but the people who live there are always vowing to rebuild on the exact same spot where tragedy took away everything they had?
I do.
Am I as crazy as they are?
I mean, is Nicole right?
Is this whole town crazy?
Because I love her and I wanna be a father to my baby girl but this ultimatum's got me.
Why can't I wrap my head around leaving this place?
I mean, at what point does the guy whose house keeps getting hit by a tornado call it a day, take his family, move someplace else?
I can't answer that for you, Sam.
Let me ask you a question.
Better pour me another one first.
I know you, Sam.
I know you better than I think you think I do.
And so I know that you've spent your whole life running away from things.
Bon Temps is the only place you actually stopped and stuck it out.
I ain't heard a question yet.
If you left do you think it would feel more like you were running from something or to somethin?
Let me put it another way.
If you stayed could you be happy here without them?
When you can answer the question, you'll know what to do.
Are you happy here, Arlene?
I mean, with everything that's going on and--
I fake it.
See, my hope is the more I fake it, the more I'll believe it until the happiness becomes real.
But, no, Sam, I ain't happy.
But there ain't a chance in hell I'm gonna stop trying to be.
Bon Temps is where my life is.
Everyone I know and love is here.
Adilyn, it's Daddy.
- Wade?
- Okay, here.
I think I got keys in here somewhere.
- What, he never changed the locks?
- I'm guessing no.
See, even though he hates me, he's as lazy as shit.
What'd I tell you?
Hey, kids, if y'all aren't wearing any clothes you better put some on because we're coming in.
Wade, honey?
Wade?
Adilyn?
[SIGHS]
Shit.
HOLLY:
Where are they?
I mean, there's only so many places they could've gone.
Does Adilyn have any friends or family on her mama's side that she could've gone to?
I don't know, some kind of fairy hangout or something?
Andy?
Baby, you crying, baby?
Something about how peaceful this lake looks, I guess...
Oh.
Okay.
Hey, just take a breath.
Just breathe.
Oh, baby.
First you and then it's my baby girl, and I--
I'm trying to run around, keep y'all safe all the time.
- I can't do it no more, Holly.
I'm sorry.
- I know.
Oh, honey of course you can't.
You're just a person.
It was bad enough that I wasn't there that night they took you, but now this-
- Now this is all on me.
- No.
- Yeah, Adilyn ran away.
- And that's all because of me.
- Hey, hey, that is not true, okay?
And we're gonna get her back.
- I know it.
- How?
Listen, Andy, I know you love me for a lot of reasons and I know that my being a Wiccan ain't high up there on that list but do you believe I'm an intuitive person?
Yeah.
Then you listen to me, sheriff.
This story's gonna have a happy ending for us, okay?
I know it.
I promise it.
Are you kidding me?
Grandpa!
What's wrong?
We need to channel nature's memory here.
May I ask to what end?
Bill is inside the house.
How is channeling nature's memory gonna help?
History teaches us great lessons.
We need to look to it, find some answers.
Give me your hands.

Hi, sweetheart.
Hi, sweetie.
She's perfect.
[BABY CRYING]
Wow.
"Wow," what?
Didn't you thin that was amazing?
I guess?
Bill's wife gave birth.
So what?
"So what?"
Was I not clear before?
Because I thought I made myself perfectly clear when I said I was looking for a miracle.
- That was a miracle.
- Babies are born all the time.
That doesn't make it less miraculous.
There's magic in the ordinary, Sook.
There's magic in the things we can see.
Birth is a miracle.
Love is a miracle.
Death is a miracle.
Forgiveness is a miracle.
Especially if you can learn to forgive yourself.
Did you bring me here to Bill's house just to trick me?
No, sweet orphan.
I brought you here because I wanted to give you some advice.
There are some things that can be fixed with magic.
But your vampire friend is not one of them.
I'm sorry.
Thank you for the life lesson.
Can you go now, please?
[SHOVELS SCRAPING]
Mama?
[ROMANTIC MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
Arlene?
- Am I dreaming?
- No.
- Then how did you--?
- I felt your pain.
I came as soon as the sun went down.
The way Sookie always made it sound I thought vampires could only feel you when you were in danger.
Arlene, the pain that you're feeling that is dangerous.
Are you really 515 years old?
Yeah, I am.
Keith.
No.
You need to know.
I'm Hep-V positive.
And I know that you vampires are all super sexual and everything but we can't have sex.
Then let's just dance.

- How'd you sleep?
- Oh, I slept like a baby.
Oh, I hope you don't mind, but we didn't wind up using any of your toys.
That's all right because we're gonna use them now.
[ADILYN SCREAMS THEN WADE GRUNTS]
- Uhn!
- Aah!
Fuck.

We overslept.
Goddamn it.
He fucking didn't.
Shall we go make some money?
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
I'm not gonna leave you.
I'm gonna stay with you till the very end, okay?
Okay.
I don't judge.
I don't judge lest--
Judge not, you lest judge.
I'm not alone.
I don't-- You have to make me be alone.
I'm here.
I felt my heart in this path and this light, the light of love, the light of God.
Please, I've led a good life.
Y'all are the only two men I've slept with so can you...
-...just go away?
- Ha.
Only two?
Oh, come on, Sarah.
Don't play me for a fool.
We both know that you fornicated with Jason Stackhouse in the balcony of the church that you and I built.
I'm no fool either, Sarah.
You lied to me.
You misled me.
I lost my head because of you.
Ha.
That's funny.
So did he.
[SARAH GASPS]
Oh, my God.
Come on, Sarah.
You fornicated with him too, didn't you?
That makes four.
Why are you here?
I'm here because you're gonna die tonight, Sarah.
SARAH:
Oh, God.
- I'm here to give you a choice between heaven and hell.
Because there's still time to save your soul.
There is no heaven, Noomi.
There is only the now and nothingness.
Nothingness?
What is nothingness?
I don't know what nothingness is.
- Which is why Christianity is a way better deal.
SARAH:
No.
If you choose Jesus your meeting with the heavenly father which takes place in the risen Christ through the communion of the Holy Spirit awaits!
Follow the path, Noomi.
Die a Buddhist.
- Fuck the path, Sarah.
Die a Christian.
- Buddhist!
- Christian!
- Buddhist!
I choose neither.
I choose me.
I am the cure.
I am the messiah.
I choose myself.
Ha-ha-ha.
That's a bad fucking call right there, Sarah.
You never could stand on your own two feet.
[CARS APPROACHING THEN SARAH GASPS]
What was that?
What, you need me to spell it out for you?
That's death coming for you.

Did your sister come to see you, Amber?
Amber, answer the fuckin' question!
She's not gonna tell us anything.
Well, maybe it's 'cause you're not asking the questions right.
What's the matter, sugar, do those chains hurt?
"Sugar"?
He's right.
I ain't telling' y'all shit.
- ( grunts )
- Maybe you're both asking the question wrong.
- May I?
- Go ahead.
Hello, Amber.
My name's Mr. Gus.
Now, Mr. Northman and Ms. De Beaufort tell me that your sister was paying you to remain in hiding.
Is that correct?
So then would you say money is a primary motivator for you?
Because, Amber, if we are correct in assuming that your sister's in possession of an antidote for this virus, it could mean a lot of money for all of us.
Did Sarah come to see you?
Her name is not Sarah.
It's Noomi, and she is a good person.
Yeah, a good person who created a virus that's killing off every single vampire on the planet.
Except now she's the cure.
Did you just say Sarah¶is¶the cure?
Now, your sister may have healed you, but she is killing me.
She killed Jeremy.
You loved Jeremy.
- May I?
- She's all yours.
And Jeremy loved you.
You were happy together.
But then your sister-- Sarah or Noomi or whatever you want to call her-- she set fire to that happiness.
( clicks )
She killed him.
Stop it.
Pam:
¶Time's wasting, Amber.
¶Tell us where she is.
I can't.
She saved me.
Well, stop trying to save her.
Fuck you!
( distorted voice ) She's my sister.
( growls )
- ( screams ) - ( gasps )
- No.
- ( speaks Japanese )

?
When you came in the air went out ?
?
And every shadow filled up with doubt ?
?
I don't know who you think you are ?
?
But before the night is through ?
?
I want to do bad things with you ?
?
I'm the kind to sit up in his room ?
?
Heart sick and eyes filled up with blue ?
?
I don't know what you've done to me ?
?
But I know this much is true ?
?
I want to do bad things with you ?
?
Ow, ooh ?
?
I want to do real bad things with you. ?
No one's here.
You recognize this truck?
Yes, it's Brian's.
Brian?
Who's Brian?
Wade and Rocky's father, my ex-husband.
Well, they should be here, then.
Adilyn!
Wade, honey, if you're here, come on out.
With your hands up where I can see them.
You don't have to be so dramatic.
- They didn't break any law.
- Like hell they didn't.
They're perverts and they're out here in violation of a parish-wide curfew.
( sighs ) Wade?
- What-- what are you doing?
- Calling her.
Even if they don't wanna answer, teenagers can have a Pavlovian response to a ringing cell phone.
( ringtone playing )
Sookie:
¶Why is it happening so fast?
I don't know.
Is it because I'm fae?
I don't know.

It's mine.
-¶( ringing continues )
- Are you gonna get it?
I ain't even sure I can stand up.
In that case, I'll get it.
No, I'll get it.
Sookie, please.
I'm not dead yet.

Hello?
Vampire Bill, it's Andy.
Is Jessica around?
Is that Andy?
Passing you over.
Andy, shit, I am so sorry.
I-
- I completely forgot about y'all.
Andy:
¶Don't worry about it, Jessica.
¶We ain't even home.
Well, where are you?
Uh, Adilyn's had your blood, right?
Uh, yeah.
But I-
- Andy, I only did it because I--
So you'd feel her, right?
If-- if she were in danger, if anything bad happened to her?
Uh, yeah.
Well, have you felt her?
No, why?
You haven't?
Oh, well, that's great.
- Holly:¶Thank God.
- Andy:¶That's great.
Wait, Andy, what's happened?
Adilyn and Wade ran off together.
Oh, my God.
Do you need my help?
No, we're already out here looking for them.
Just, uh, do me a favor.
Promise me if you do feel her, give me a call, or even if you hear from her.
- Yeah, of course.
But, Andy?
- Yeah?
If you find them, will you call me?
( chuckles ) You got it, Red.
( sighs )
Well, the good news is they're alive.
But where the fuck do we look now?
Brian has a lake house.
Shit, that's it.
Let's go.
Where is this lake house, anyhow?
Half hour north of Oklahoma City.
- Oklahoma?
- I know.
When we get there, I'm gonna hug them, but then I'm gonna kill them.
Here we are.
Home, sweet home.
( laughs ) Oh, my God.
- Wow.
- You like?
This is amazing.
Yeah, it's-- it's cool.
Wow.
Just breaks my heart that your parents don't support the love that you feel for each other.
Oh, and for what it's worth, when I was your age,
I used to fuck my brother, too.
A lot.
( clicks tongue )
This way.
Okay.
So, there's a fully stocked fridge with snacks.
Sling is over there, nipple clamps on the bedside table with some erotic oils and handcuffs.
Dildos and toys are on the wall.
Oh, I got that strap-on in Zanzibar in the 19th century.
It was one of the first of its kind.
- What's--
- What's it for?
( laughs ) You sweet, sweet boy.
Your imagination's a muscle.
Use it or lose it.
( laughs )
Now I'm gonna go get some shut-eye.
You'll be safe here, and you can stay as long as you like.
- Are we cool?
- Totally.
Yeah.
- And, Violet?
- Hmm?
Thank you for everything.
Yeah, thanks.
Aw, you don't have to thank me.
I love love, and watching love flourish is all the thanks I need.
( both laugh )
Have fun fucking.
- ( laughs ) -¶( door closes )
( clock ticking )
Bill.
This isn't happening.
Bill:
¶Yeah, Sookie, it is.
In your book you mentioned an experimental treatment in, um-- in India?
- It's years away.
- Gotta be something to slow this thing down.
Sookie, there's no cure.
I refuse to accept that.
( gasps ) Oh, my God!
I didn't mean to frighten you.
Well, you did.
Matter of fact, you scared the bejeezus outta me.
My apologies.
I know you've been through a great deal of suffering as of late and I should have known better than to sneak up on you.
Why did you, then?
Because, Arlene, it's still not safe for you to be out alone at night.
I came to see you home... to offer you my protection.
Well, just so long as you don't get the wrong idea, 'cause, to be honest, Keith, this is silly.
I mean, what are you, 25?
I'm 515 years old.
Look, you're very attractive, but I am not a fangbanger, okay?
I know who I am.
And a human with a vampire is just wrong.
You know?
( gasps )
Did that feel wrong?
Yes.
What about that?
That feel wrong?
Huh?
( whimpers )
( gasps ) What are you doing?
( moaning )
( gasps )
( moaning continues )
Oh, God.
( moaning continues )
- ( wincing )
- Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God, don't stop.
Oh, God.
Oh-- oh, my--
( gasps )
Oh, fu-uck.
( speaking Japanese )
You shouldn't have killed her.
She wasn't gonna cooperate anyway.
She was cooperating.
What do you want me to say, Pam?
I saw Sarah on that couch and I fucking lost it.
- Do you wanna die?
- I wanna kill Sarah Newlin.
That's why we came back, remember?
- No.
- No?
She's the antidote, Eric.
She can heal you.
This isn't about capture and kill anymore.
This is about capture and--
Capture and exploit.
You're a capitalist, yes?
I have a business proposition for you.
All right, we're listening.
Together we track down Miss Newlin, we capture her, and we synthesize her blood and we bottle it and distribute it worldwide as a product-
- New Blood.
Catchy.
Now, Yokonomo Corporation will retain controlling interest, of course, but you will own 49% of the company.
I only see one problem.
How the hell are we supposed to find her?
In Japan, business and government work together.
Now, when Tokyo hears about Miss Newlin's potential, we will have immediate access to all of her intelligence assets.
We will find her.
You don't need a partner.
I'm sorry, was that a question?
My word is oak.
Why do you need us?
New Blood will eradicate Hepatitis V from the planet.
Now, the only problem is the public has lost its trust in Yokonomo Corp.
They'll want proof that New Blood works, which means we'll need a vampire's testimonial for the advertising.
You want Eric to be your fuckin' spokesperson for your vampire Jenny Craig commercials?
Now, I ain't a homo, but you have to admit he is a handsome devil.
No.
Do you know what 49% of a three-and-a-half-billion- dollar-a-year company is?
I thought so.
Now, like I said, my word is oak.
What is your word worth?
- You have my word.
- Mr. Gus:¶Really?
'Cause I thought I had your word earlier tonight and then you hauled off and killed the sister.
You need me, right?
Well, then you're just gonna have to trust me.
I think I'm gonna stay up, watch him sleep.
I have a better idea.
Why don't you climb in with him?
You don't think that would be weird?
No, honey, I really don't.
And you need your rest, so, come on.
See?
It's not weird.
Sookie?
Yeah?
You said that you refuse to accept this.
But what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
But I meet people every day who say that they don't believe in miracles.
Sometimes they don't say it.
Sometimes they're just thinking it, but when I hear that, I just wanna shake them 'cause how can you not believe in miracles and magic when they're happening all around us every single day?
There's a miracle out there just waiting for Bill.
I just have to go out there and find it.
( sniffles ) I really hope you do.
- All right.
- It's okay.
Good night.
It's morning.
'Course it is.
When I marry, Father, it will be for love.
I'm sorry, son, but you're a man now.
It's time for you to take a wife.
You will marry Caroline Shelby, the neighbor's daughter.
But they've only just moved here.
I haven't even met her yet.
- William--
- I was gonna go to California.
I wanted to see the world.
The Shelbys are a good family and it's important.
- Father, please--
- I'm dying, William.
You will marry Caroline Shelby, not for me, but for your mother.
This way, you see, our lands will combine so she won't have to worry how to get by when I'm gone.
Very well, sir.
I will meet her.
She's just back from finishing school.
I'm sure you'll find her to your liking.
I have met her, William.
She's quite comely.
Hoyt:
This is about the only place in town you can get a decent breakfast.
I thought you said it was called Merlotte's.
It is.
No, it's not.
Look.
Well, I'll be.
Huh.
( music playing )
We got customers, Big John!
And I'm ready for them.
Shi-it.
Welcome to Bellefleur's.
Thank you.
Hoyt?
Arlene.
Oh, my-- oh, sugar, I am so sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
And I'm-- I'm so sorry about Terry.
- Yeah, life is precious.
- Yes, it is.
- Mm.
- Yeah.
Oh, Arlene, this is my girlfriend Brigette.
Nice to meet you, Miss Bardot.
Oh, you are too sweet.
I'm really not.
Well, it's nice to meet you, too.
I didn't know you took the place over.
Yeah, like five months ago, I think it was.
Yeah, business was booming until the H-vamps came.
Did y'all have any problems with them up in Alaska?
Not yet.
We've only been spared because it just about never gets dark where we live this time of year.
I never thought of that.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Brigette's super smart.
We met on the job.
She's a microbiologist.
- Hoyt, stop.
- But she don't like attention, though.
- Ooh.
- Listen, I am starving.
Oh, of course.
Let me get you some menus.
Sit wherever you want.
Can I get y'all something to drink while you decide?
Coffee for me, hot tea for Brigette, and we're in a little bit of a hurry.
I gotta get to the police station to talk to Officer...
Stackhouse.
You mean Jason.
I didn't get a first name.
Just Stackhouse.
-¶( cell phone ringing ) -¶( music blaring ¶in headphones )
- ( ringing continues ) -¶( music and vacuum stop )
Yeah, Stackhouse.
Hoyt's here, Jason.
- What?
Hoyt?
He's where?
-¶At the BBG.
And he's acting like he doesn't even know you.
Yeah, that's 'cause he doesn't.
Listen, Arlene-
- Arlene, do not say anything to him, all right?
- I'm on my way.
- Okay.
So... should I use this on you?
Uh, how much does it say to use?
Um... it doesn't.
All it says is that its chief ingredient is horny goat weed and that it "invigorates the sensory nerves while restoring the adrenals and alleviating fatigue for a stress-reducing effect."
You wanna try something else, then?
Wade thinking:
¶Okay, just keep cool.
¶Be a man.
If she's into this stuff, then you gotta do whatever it takes to please your woman, even if you ain't into this at all.
- Oh, thank God!
- What?
You're not into this.
- Are-- are you?
- No.
Oh, my God.
Thank you.
No, Wade, thank you.
You have no idea how happy you just made me.
I just thought you wanted to experiment or something.
No, and I thought that you wanted to on account of you being so much more experienced than me.
Wait, what?
- I--
- What?
Listen, I'm not-- I'm not more experienced.
I mean, our first time was my first time.
Mine, too.
I really do love you, Wade Cleary.
I love you, too.
?
Everything is fine ?
?
I don't ask anymore... ?
( whispers ) That is Hoyt's girlfriend.
?
Only can remind me ?
?
You don't want me ?
?
Anymore... ?
Mr. Fortenberry?
Ahem, Officer Stackhouse?
- Yes, sir.
- I'm Hoyt Fortenberry.
This is my girlfriend.
Brigette.
It's nice to meet you, too.
Though I'm sorry about the circumstances.
Well, uh... to be honest, you know, I try not to think about it.
- It just all seems so unreal.
- Hmm.
It'll probably feel more real once you go and see her.
- Hmm?
- Hoyt:¶Yeah, ¶I don't know if I'm--
I'm ready for all that yet, but... uh, you wanna join us for breakfast?
Hmm?
You wanna join us for breakfast?
Oh, uh, you guys finish up.
I'll just be waiting over at the bar.
Oh, no, don't be ridiculous.
No, please.
We insist.
-¶( flatware clatters )
- Oh... ( Hoyt chuckles )
- It's okay.
- Sorry about that.
?
I remember this place before ?
?
It's some kind of hell ?
?
A phobia strikes the ground as I fall down... ?
( radio turns off )
Dr. Ludwig, thank you for coming on such short notice.
- Where's the patient?
- At his house.
I would've had you meet me there, except with him being a vampire and all,
I thought this was safer.
Next time, save yourself some money and have me meet you where the patient is.
I fear nothing and no one and I have no natural enemies.
Well, where is he?
Um, across the cemetery.
( sarcastically ) Ooh, how very spooky.
A cemetery.
Shall we?
-¶( music playing ) -¶( chatter )
There she is.
- Where?
- Right over there with the Shelbys.
- William.
- Stewart.
- Claire.
- Margaret.
And you must be Caroline.
( chatter, laughter )
I have to admit, you're not what I was expecting.
What were you expecting?
Well, your daddy, only younger and just as--
Rotund?
( both laugh )
No, I take after my mother.
The truth be told, Caroline, you're not quite what I was expecting either.
Oh?
And what were you expecting?
My father described you as "comely."
Well, comely is a good thing.
I know it is, but that word is just so anachronistic that I suppose I thought you'd be--
Old and dowdy?
Formerly pretty, yes.
( laughs )
You feel their eyes on us as aggressively as I do?
Now that you mention it, I can feel all eight of their eyes searing a hole into the back of my head.
Would you care to take a walk with me?
I would.
Dr. Ludwig:
¶Mr. Compton.
Mr. Compton!
- Mr. Compton!
- Careful, he doesn't like to be woken.
Like I said, I fear nothing and no one.
- Mr. Compton!
- ( growls )
Remember me?
- Doctor?
- Ludwig.
Put your fangs away, son, and meet me in the parlor.
Mm-mm.
Nasty, nasty, nasty.
Whew.
Congratulations, Mr. Compton.
They said it could not be done, but you have thoroughly grossed me out.
Can you help him?
How many days ago do you believe you were infected?
Don't look to her.
I'm the one that asked you the question.
I gotta say, Dr. Ludwig,
I'm a little curious about your bedside manner.
Newsflash-- sometimes monogamy means one thing to hopelessly romantic blonde girls and something altogether different to their vampire lovers.
We are no longer lovers.
Are you sure she knows that?
He contracted the virus from me.
I was exposed through a cut in my arm.
He drank my blood, and he got sick pretty much right away.
I'm sorry, but that's not how this virus works.
Would it make any difference if we told you that Sookie was a halfling?
- Half what?
Half fae?
- Mm-hmm.
A few weeks ago, I was called to the home of a sick vampire in Monroe.
He had a not dissimilarly accelerated rate of infection.
Went from stage one to stage three in 10 days.
I was perplexed until he revealed to me that his boyfriend is a Hep-V positive fairy.
He was no halfling, mind you.
He was the real deal.
And even so, he didn't look anywhere near as bad as Mr. Compton does.
Do you happen to know the name of your line?
- My line?
- Come on, missy.
Your fairy line, your lineage.
I don't know.
I don't know the name.
I guess I could ask Niall.
Niall Brigant?
Yeah, do you know him?
Are you related to Niall Brigant?
Yeah, he's my great-great- great-times-a-thousand- grandfather.
- Why?
- ( panting )
I'm so fuckin' outta here.
- Dr. Ludwig?
- I'll show myself out.
God damn it, Stackhouse.
Get your fuckin' eyes off her.
I should've been here.
Maybe I could've saved her or at least just-- just been here for her when it happened or something.
Hey, babe.
You can't blame yourself.
And I'm sure if she were here right now, your mama would tell you the same thing.
Hoyt:
¶No, she wouldn't.
If she were here right now, she'd lay it on thick.
God, what I wouldn't give for one more guilt trip.
( crying )
- ( mouths words )
- Huh?
( mouthing words )
( quietly ) Shit.
Hi.
Did you know Maxine?
Um, yeah-- yeah, a little.
Good.
I think he needs to talk to somebody who knew her.
Do you think you could just go and talk to him, maybe?
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
( sniffles )
Uh...
I know it's hard, Mr. Fortenberry.
-¶How'd it happen?
- Huh?
How'd she die?
Um, well, you remember Vince McNeil?
- The orthodontist?
- Yeah.
Yeah, that's him.
Um... well, when the shit hit the fan at the BBG last week,
Mr. McNeil, he... got a bunch of the townsfolk all riled up, and together they took the law into their own hands.
Was my mama one of them?
No, that-- no.
No, she was not.
She-- she was one of the good folks.
Did you get the son of a bitch that did it to her?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Yeah, I sure did.
Thank you, man.
Grandpa Niall?
( wind blowing )
You know I've been in a lot of situations lately.
I had plenty of good reasons to call on a fairy godfather, but I didn't... until now... 'cause I like to think of myself as strong.
But I ain't this strong.
If you're listening, Grandpa Niall,
I need you to materialize right here, right now.
( wind gusting )
You know what?
Fuck this.
( clatters )
Jesus Christ.
Niall.
Hi.
How do you make that wonderful spaghetti?
This is so good.
- Can we go now?
- No.
Food first.
One mustn't forget to nourish oneself.
Please, I don't know how much time he has left.
I understand, but if this munchkin doctor doesn't know how to heal him, what can I do?
You were watching?
I'm always watching you.
Do you know why she was so afraid of you, then?
We are royalty.
Dwarves have an innate fear of us.
Maybe because we killed so many of them in the past.
I just realized that if you're always watching... did you know I was infecting Bill when he was feeding off of me?
I did.
Why would you let me do that?
I don't like him.
You don't have to like him.
You're doing something for me.
What I meant was I don't like him for you.
Grandpa Niall, you say we're royalty, but other than the vampire-killing light ball that I can only use once, by the way,
I can't think of a single fuckin' advantage in being what we are.
If you say that we're so fuckin' special,
I am asking you...
I'm begging you... prove it.
Use some of your magic for me.
Fine, Sookie.
I'll try.

Jason?
Jason?
Over here.
Oh, hey, Noomi.
Oh, God, I'm so glad you're here.
I feel so alone.
Huh.
Well, we all die alone.
What?
You're gonna die tonight.
See, Eric's coming for ya and there ain't no escaping it.
But I don't wanna die.
( laughs ) Well, that's just too fuckin' bad.
See, death comes for all of us, and your number's up.
No.
You're not real.
Maybe not, but death is.
Fuck off!
Yeah, I'll be sure to do that, then.
I'll see you in hell when I get there!
There is no hell.
( chuckles ) You just try to convince yourself of that.
You don't even know--
Hold it together, Noomi.
You are one with the universe.
Keep it together.
Okay?
( beeping )
( speaks Japanese )
( speaks Japanese )
You know how on the news you see these-- these places get wiped out by tornados, but the people who live there are always vowing to rebuild on the exact same spot where tragedy took away everything they had?
I do.
Am I as crazy as they are?
I mean, is Nicole right?
Is this whole town crazy?
'Cause I love her and I wanna be a father to my baby girl, but... this ultimatum's got me.
Why can't I wrap my head around leaving this place?
I mean, at what point does the guy whose house keeps getting hit by a tornado call it a day, take his family, move someplace else?
I can't answer that for you, Sam.
Let me ask you a question.
Better pour me another one first.
I know you, Sam.
I know you better than I think you think I do, and so I know that you've spent your whole life running away from things.
Bon Temps's the only place you actually stopped and stuck it out.
I ain't heard a question yet.
If you left... do you think it would feel more like you were running from something or to something?
Let me put it another way.
If you stayed... could you be happy here without them?
When you can answer the question, you'll know what to do.
Are you happy here, Arlene?
I mean, with everything that's going on and--
I fake it.
See, my hope is the more I fake it, the more I'll believe it until the happiness becomes real.
But, no, Sam, I ain't happy.
But there ain't a chance in hell I'm gonna stop trying to be.
Bon Temps's where my life is.
Everyone I know and love is here.
( knocks ) Adilyn, it's Daddy.
- Wade?
- Okay, here.
I think I got keys in here somewhere.
What, he never changed the locks?
I'm guessing no.
See, even though he hates me, he's as lazy as shit.
What'd I tell you?
Hey, kids, if y'all aren't wearing any clothes, you better put some on 'cause we're coming in.
Wade, honey?
Wade?
Adilyn?
( sighs )
Shit.
Holly:
¶Where are they?
I mean, there's only so many places they could've gone.
Does Adilyn have any friends or family on her mama's side that she could've gone to?
I don't know, some kind of fairy hangout or something?
Andy?
Baby, you crying, baby?
Something about how peaceful this lake looks, I guess, compared to this fucked-up reality we live in.
- I don't know.
- Oh, okay.
Hey, just take a breath.
- Just breathe.
Oh, baby.
- ( crying )
First you and then it's my baby girl, and I--
( mouths words )
I'm trying to run around, keep y'all safe all the time.
I can't do it no more, Holly.
I'm sorry.
I know.
Oh, honey... of course you can't.
You're just a person.
It was bad enough that I wasn't there that night they took you, but now this-- now this is all on me.
- No.
- Yeah, Adilyn ran away, and that's all 'cause of me.
Hey, hey, that is not true, okay?
And we're gonna get her back.
I know it.
How?
Listen, Andy, I know you love me for a lot of reasons, and I know that my being a Wiccan ain't high up there on that list, but do you believe I'm an intuitive person?
Yeah.
Then you listen to me, Sheriff.
This story's gonna have a happy ending for us, okay?
I know it.
I promise it.
( wind howling )
Are you kidding me?
Grandpa!
What's wrong?
We need to channel nature's memory here.
May I ask to what end?
Bill is inside the house.
How is channeling nature's memory gonna help?
History teaches us great lessons.
We need to look to it, find some answers.
Give me your hands.
( woman wailing )
( wailing continues )
Now, she will pull through, William.
( groaning, yelling )
-¶( baby crying )
- Nurse:¶Mr. Compton, ¶please come in.
Nurse:
Congratulations, Mr. Compton.
Hi, sweetheart.
She's perfect.
( crying continues )
Wow.
Wow, what?
Didn't you think that was amazing?
I... guess?
Bill's wife gave birth.
So what?
"So what"?
Was I not clear before?
'Cause I thought I made myself perfectly clear when I said I was looking for a miracle.
- That was a miracle.
- Babies are born all the time.
That doesn't make it less miraculous.
There's magic in the ordinary, Sook.
There's magic in the things we can see.
Birth is a miracle.
Love is a miracle.
Death is a miracle.
Forgiveness is a miracle, especially if you can learn to forgive yourself.
Did you bring me here to Bill's house... just to trick me?
No, sweet orphan.
I brought you here because I wanted to give you some advice.
There are some things that can be fixed with magic.
But your vampire friend is not one of them.
I'm sorry.
Thank you for the life lesson.
Can you go now, please?
( shovels scraping )
Mama?
?
Every night ?
?
Just to sprinkle stardust and to whisper ?
?
Go to sleep, everything is all right ?
-¶?
I close my eyes... ?
- Arlene?
?
Then I drift away ?
?
Into the magic night, I softly say... ?
- Am I dreaming?
- No.
- Then how did you--
- I felt your pain.
?
A silent prayer ?
?
Like dreamers do ?
?
Then I fall asleep to dream ?
?
My dreams of you ?
?
In dreams... ?
I came as soon as the sun went down.
The way Sookie always made it sound,
I thought vampires could only feel you when you were in danger.
Arlene, the pain that you're feeling... that is dangerous.
Are you really 515 years old?
Yeah, I am.
?
In dreams ?
?
But just before the dawn... ?
Keith...
No.
You need to know.
I'm Hep-V positive, and I know that you vampires are all super sexual and everything, but we can't have sex.
Then let's just dance.
?
...that you said good-bye... ?
( crying )
?
It only happens in my dreams... ?
( Adilyn and Wade giggling )
- Adilyn:
Oh, Violet.
- Hello, lovebirds.
- How'd you sleep?
- Oh, I slept like a baby.
( chuckles )
Oh, I hope you don't mind, but we didn't wind up using any of your toys.
That's all right... because we're gonna use them now.
- ( gasps )
- Whoa!
- ( screams ) - ( gasps )
Fuck!
( door opens, closes )
Jessica?
Pam?
Pam.
We overslept.
God damn it.
He fucking didn't.
Shall we go make some money?
( knock on door )
I'm not gonna leave you.
I'm gonna stay with you till the very end, okay?
Okay.
( muttering )
I don't judge.
I don't judge lest--
Judge not, you lest judge.
I'm not alone.
I don't-- you have to make me be alone.
I'm here.
I felt my heart in this path and this light, the light of love, the light of God.
Please, I've led a good life.
I mean, y'all are the only two men I've ever slept with,
- so can you please just go away?
!
- Ha!
Only two?
Oh, come on, Sarah.
Don't play me for a fool.
We both know that you fornicated with Jason Stackhouse in the balcony of the church that you and I built.
I'm no fool either,¶Sarah.
You lied to me.
You misled me.
I lost my head because of you.
( chuckles ) That's funny.
So did he.
( Sarah cries out )
Oh, my God.
Come on, Sarah.
You fornicated with him, too, didn't ya?
That makes four.
Why are you here?
I'm here because you're gonna die tonight, Sarah.
I'm here to give you a choice between heaven and hell because there's still time to save your soul.
There is no heaven, Noomi.
There is only the now and nothingness.
Nothingness?
What is nothingness?
I don't know what nothingness is!
- Which is why Christianity is a way better deal!
- Sarah:¶No.
If you choose Jesus, your meeting with the Heavenly Father which takes place in the Risen Christ through the communion of the Holy Spirit awaits!
Follow the path, Noomi.
Die a Buddhist.
Fuck the path, Sarah.
Die a Christian.
Buddhist!
- Christian!
- Buddhist!
I choose neither!
I choose me!
I am the cure!
I am the messiah!
- I choose myself.
- ( laughs )
That's a bad fuckin' call right there, Sarah.
You never could stand on your own two feet.
( cars approaching )
( gasps ) What was that?
What, you need me to spell it out for ya?
That's death coming for ya.

Did your sister come to see you, Amber?
Amber, answer the fuckin' question!
She's not gonna tell us anything.
Well, maybe it's 'cause you're not asking the questions right.
What's the matter, sugar, do those chains hurt?
"Sugar"?
He's right.
I ain't telling' y'all shit.
Maybe you're both asking the question wrong.
- May I?
- Go ahead.
Hello, Amber.
My name's Mr. Gus.
Now, Mr. Northman and Ms. De Beaufort tell me that your sister was paying you to remain in hiding.
Is that correct?
So then would you say money is a primary motivator for you?
Because, Amber, if we are correct in assuming that your sister's in possession of an antidote for this virus, it could mean a lot of money for all of us.
Did Sarah come to see you?
Her name is not Sarah.
It's Noomi, and she is a good person.
Yeah, a good person who created a virus that's killing off every single vampire on the planet.
Except now she's the cure.
Did you just say Sarah is the cure?
Now, your sister may have healed you, but she is killing me.
She killed Jeremy.
You loved Jeremy.
- May I?
- She's all yours.
And Jeremy loved you.
You were happy together.
But then your sister--
Sarah or Noomi or whatever you want to call her-- she set fire to that happiness.
She killed him.
Stop it.
Time's wasting, Amber.
Tell us where she is.
I can't.
She saved me.
Well, stop trying to save her.
Fuck you!
She's my sister.
No.
Eric.

No one's here.
You recognize this truck?
Yes, it's Brian's.
Brian?
Who's Brian?
Wade and Rocky's father, my ex-husband.
Well, they should be here, then.
Adilyn!
Wade, honey, if you're here, come on out.
With your hands up where I can see them.
You don't have to be so dramatic.
- They didn't break any law.
- Like hell they didn't.
They're perverts and they're out here in violation of a parish-wide curfew.
Wade?
- What-- what are you doing?
- Calling her.
Even if they don't wanna answer, teenagers can have a Pavlovian response to a ringing cell phone.
Why is it happening so fast?
I don't know.
Is it because I'm fae?
I don't know.
It's mine.
-
- Are you gonna get it?
I ain't even sure I can stand up.
In that case, I'll get it.
No, I'll get it.
Sookie, please.
I'm not dead yet.
Hello?
Vampire Bill, it's Andy.
Is Jessica around?
Is that Andy?
Passing you over.
Andy, shit, I am so sorry.
I-
- I completely forgot about y'all.
Don't worry about it, Jessica.
We ain't even home.
Well, where are you?
Uh, Adilyn's had your blood, right?
Uh, yeah.
But I-
- Andy, I only did it because I--
So you'd feel her, right?
If-- if she were in danger, if anything bad happened to her?
Uh, yeah.
Well, have you felt her?
No, why?
You haven't?
Oh, well, that's great.
- Thank God.
- That's great.
Wait, Andy, what's happened?
Adilyn and Wade ran off together.
Oh, my God.
Do you need my help?
No, we're already out here looking for them.
Just, uh, do me a favor.
Promise me if you do feel her, give me a call, or even if you hear from her.
- Yeah, of course.
But, Andy?
- Yeah?
If you find them, will you call me?
You got it, Red.
Well, the good news is they're alive.
But where the fuck do we look now?
Brian has a lake house.
Shit, that's it.
Let's go.
Where is this lake house, anyhow?
Half hour north of Oklahoma City.
- Oklahoma?
- I know.
When we get there, I'm gonna hug them, but then I'm gonna kill them.
Here we are.
Home, sweet home.
Oh, my God.
- Wow.
- You like?
This is amazing.
Yeah, it's-- it's cool.
Wow.
Just breaks my heart that your parents don't support the love that you feel for each other.
Oh, and for what it's worth, when I was your age,
I used to fuck my brother, too.
A lot.
This way.
Okay.
So, there's a fully stocked fridge with snacks.
Sling is over there, nipple clamps on the bedside table with some erotic oils and handcuffs.
Dildos and toys are on the wall.
Oh, I got that strap-on in Zanzibar in the 19th century.
It was one of the first of its kind.
- What's--
- What's it for?
You sweet, sweet boy.
Your imagination's a muscle.
Use it or lose it.
Now I'm gonna go get some shut-eye.
You'll be safe here, and you can stay as long as you like.
- Are we cool?
- Totally.
Yeah.
- And, Violet?
- Hmm?
Thank you for everything.
Yeah, thanks.
Aw, you don't have to thank me.
I love love, and watching love flourish is all the thanks I need.
Have fun fucking.
Bill.
This isn't happening.
Yeah, Sookie, it is.
In your book you mentioned an experimental treatment in, um-- in India?
It's years away.
Gotta be something to slow this thing down.
Sookie, there's no cure.
I refuse to accept that.
Oh, my God!
I didn't mean to frighten you.
Well, you did.
Matter of fact, you scared the bejeezus outta me.
My apologies.
I know you've been through a great deal of suffering as of late and I should have known better than to sneak up on you.
Why did you, then?
Because, Arlene, it's still not safe for you to be out alone at night.
I came to see you home... to offer you my protection.
Well, just so long as you don't get the wrong idea, 'cause, to be honest, Keith, this is silly.
I mean, what are you, 25?
I'm 515 years old.
Look, you're very attractive, but I am not a fangbanger, okay?
I know who I am.
And a human with a vampire is just wrong.
You know?
Did that feel wrong?
Yes.
What about that?
That feel wrong?
Huh?
What are you doing?
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God.
Oh, God, Oh, fu-uck.
You shouldn't have killed her.
She wasn't gonna cooperate anyway.
She was cooperating.
What do you want me to say, Pam?
I saw Sarah on that couch and I fucking lost it.
- Do you wanna die?
- I wanna kill Sarah Newlin.
That's why we came back, remember?
- No.
- No?
She's the antidote, Eric.
She can heal you.
This isn't about capture and kill anymore.
This is about capture and--
Capture and exploit.
You're a capitalist, yes?
I have a business proposition for you.
All right, we're listening.
Together we track down Miss Newlin, we capture her, and we synthesize her blood and we bottle it and distribute it worldwide as a product-
- New Blood.
Catchy.
Now, Yokonomo Corporation will retain controlling interest, of course, but you will own 49% of the company.
I only see one problem.
How the hell are we supposed to find her?
In Japan, business and government work together.
Now, when Tokyo hears about Miss Newlin's potential, we will have immediate access to all of her intelligence assets.
We will find her.
You don't need a partner.
I'm sorry, was that a question?
My word is oak.
Why do you need us?
New Blood will eradicate Hepatitis V from the planet.
Now, the only problem is the public has lost its trust in Yokonomo Corp.
They'll want proof that New Blood works, which means we'll need a vampire's testimonial for the advertising.
You want Eric to be your fuckin' spokesperson for your vampire Jenny Craig commercials?
Now, I ain't a homo, but you have to admit he is a handsome devil.
No.
Do you know what 49% of a three-and-a-half-billion- dollar-a-year company is?
I thought so.
Now, like I said, my word is oak.
What is your word worth?
- You have my word.
- Really?
'Cause I thought I had your word earlier tonight and then you hauled off and killed the sister.
You need me, right?
Well, then you're just gonna have to trust me.
I think I'm gonna stay up, watch him sleep.
I have a better idea.
Why don't you climb in with him?
You don't think that would be weird?
No, honey, I really don't.
And you need your rest, so, come on.
See?
It's not weird.
Sookie?
Yeah?
You said that you refuse to accept this.
But what are you gonna do?
I don't know.
But I meet people every day who say that they don't believe in miracles.
Sometimes they don't say it.
Sometimes they're just thinking it, but when I hear that, I just wanna shake them 'cause how can you not believe in miracles and magic when they're happening all around us every single day?
There's a miracle out there just waiting for Bill.
I just have to go out there and find it.
I really hope you do.
- All right.
- It's okay.
Good night.
It's morning.
'Course it is.
When I marry, Father, it will be for love.
I'm sorry, son, but you're a man now.
It's time for you to take a wife.
You will marry Caroline Shelby, the neighbor's daughter.
But they've only just moved here.
I haven't even met her yet.
- William--
- I was gonna go to California.
I wanted to see the world.
The Shelbys are a good family and it's important.
- Father, please--
- I'm dying, William.
You will marry Caroline Shelby, not for me, but for your mother.
This way, you see, our lands will combine so she won't have to worry how to get by when I'm gone.
Very well, sir.
I will meet her.
She's just back from finishing school.
I'm sure you'll find her to your liking.
I have met her, William.
She's quite comely.
This is about the only place in town you can get a decent breakfast.
I thought you said it was called Merlotte's.
It is.
No, it's not.
Look.
Well, I'll be.
Huh.
We got customers, Big John!
And I'm ready for them.
Shi-it.
Welcome to Bellefleur's.
Thank you.
Hoyt?
Arlene.
Oh, my-- oh, sugar, I am so sorry for your loss.
Thank you.
And I'm-- I'm so sorry about Terry.
- Yeah, life is precious.
- Yes, it is.
- Mm.
- Yeah.
Oh, Arlene, this is my girlfriend Brigette.
Nice to meet you, Miss Bardot.
Oh, you are too sweet.
I'm really not.
Well, it's nice to meet you, too.
I didn't know you took the place over.
Yeah, like five months ago, I think it was.
Yeah, business was booming until the H-vamps came.
Did y'all have any problems with them up in Alaska?
Not yet.
We've only been spared because it just about never gets dark where we live this time of year.
I never thought of that.
- Yeah.
- Yeah, Brigette's super smart.
We met on the job.
She's a microbiologist.
- Hoyt, stop.
- But she don't like attention, though.
- Ooh.
- Listen, I am starving.
Oh, of course.
Let me get you some menus.
Sit wherever you want.
Can I get y'all something to drink while you decide?
Coffee for me, hot tea for Brigette, and we're in a little bit of a hurry.
I gotta get to the police station to talk to Officer...
Stackhouse.
You mean Jason.
I didn't get a first name.
Just Stackhouse.
Yeah, Stackhouse.
Hoyt's here, Jason.
- What?
Hoyt?
He's where?
- At the BBG.
And he's acting like he doesn't even know you.
Yeah, that's 'cause he doesn't.
Listen, Arlene-
- Arlene, do not say anything to him, all right?
- I'm on my way.
- Okay.
So... should I use this on you?
Uh, how much does it say to use?
Um... it doesn't.
All it says is that its chief ingredient is horny goat weed and that it "invigorates and alleviating fatigue for a stress-reducing effect."
You wanna try something else, then?
Okay, just keep cool.
Be a man.
If she's into this stuff, then you gotta do whatever it takes to please your woman, even if you ain't into this at all.
- Oh, thank God!
- What?
You're not into this.
- Are-- are you?
- No.
Oh, my God.
Thank you.
No, Wade, thank you.
You have no idea how happy you just made me.
I just thought you wanted to experiment or something.
No, and I thought that you wanted to on account of you being so much more experienced than me.
Wait, what?
- I--
- What?
Listen, I'm not-- I'm not more experienced.
I mean, our first time was my first time.
Mine, too.
I really do love you, Wade Cleary.
I love you, too.

Yes, sir.
I'm Hoyt Fortenberry.
This is my girlfriend.
Brigette.
It's nice to meet you, too.
Though I'm sorry about the circumstances.
Well, uh... to be honest, you know, I try not to think about it.
- It just all seems so unreal.
- Hmm.
It'll probably feel more real once you go and see her.
- Hmm?
- Yeah, I don't know if I'm--
I'm ready for all that yet, but... uh, you wanna join us for breakfast?
Hmm?
You wanna join us for breakfast?
Oh, uh, you guys finish up.
I'll just be waiting over at the bar.
Oh, no, don't be ridiculous.
No, please.
We insist.

Dr. Ludwig, thank you for coming on such short notice.
- Where's the patient?
- At his house.
I would've had you meet me there, except with him being a vampire and all,
I thought this was safer.
Next time, save yourself some money and have me meet you where the patient is.
I fear nothing and no one and I have no natural enemies.
Well, where is he?
Um, across the cemetery.
Ooh, how very spooky.
A cemetery.
Shall we?
There she is.
- Where?
- Right over there with the Shelbys.
- William.
- Stewart.
- Claire.
- Margaret.
And you must be Caroline.
I have to admit, you're not what I was expecting.
What were you expecting?
Well, your daddy, only younger and just as--
Rotund?
No, I take after my mother.
The truth be told, Caroline, you're not quite what I was expecting either.
Oh?
And what were you expecting?
My father described you as "comely."
Well, comely is a good thing.
I know it is, but that word is just so anachronistic that I suppose I thought you'd be--
Old and dowdy?
Formerly pretty, yes.
You feel their eyes on us as aggressively as I do?
Now that you mention it, I can feel all eight of their eyes searing a hole into the back of my head.
Would you care to take a walk with me?
I would.
Mr. Compton.
Mr. Compton!
- Mr. Compton!
- Careful, he doesn't like to be woken.
Like I said, I fear nothing and no one.
Mr. Compton!
Remember me?
- Doctor?
- Ludwig.
Put your fangs away, son, and meet me in the parlor.
Mm-mm.
Nasty, nasty, nasty.
Whew.
Congratulations, Mr. Compton.
They said it could not be done, but you have thoroughly grossed me out.
Can you help him?
How many days ago do you believe you were infected?
Don't look to her.
I'm the one that asked you the question.
I gotta say, Dr. Ludwig,
I'm a little curious about your bedside manner.
Newsflash-- sometimes monogamy means one thing to hopelessly romantic blonde girls and something altogether different to their vampire lovers.
We are no longer lovers.
Are you sure she knows that?
He contracted the virus from me.
I was exposed through a cut in my arm.
He drank my blood, and he got sick pretty much right away.
I'm sorry, but that's not how this virus works.
Would it make any difference if we told you that Sookie was a halfling?
- Half what?
Half fae?
- Mm-hmm.
A few weeks ago, I was called to the home of a sick vampire in Monroe.
He had a not dissimilarly accelerated rate of infection.
Went from stage one to stage three in 10 days.
I was perplexed until he revealed to me that his boyfriend is a Hep-V positive fairy.
He was no halfling, mind you.
He was the real deal.
And even so, he didn't look anywhere near as bad as Mr. Compton does.
Do you happen to know the name of your line?
- My line?
- Come on, missy.
Your fairy line, your lineage.
I don't know.
I don't know the name.
I guess I could ask Niall.
Niall Brigant?
Yeah, do you know him?
Are you related to Niall Brigant?
Yeah, he's my great-great- great-times-a-thousand-grandfather.
Why?
I'm so fuckin' outta here.
- Dr. Ludwig?
- I'll show myself out.
God damn it, Stackhouse.
Get your fuckin' eyes off her.
I should've been here.
Maybe I could've saved her or at least just-- just been here for her when it happened or something.
Hey, babe.
You can't blame yourself.
And I'm sure if she were here right now, your mama would tell you the same thing.
No, she wouldn't.
If she were here right now, she'd lay it on thick.
God, what I wouldn't give for one more guilt trip.
Huh?
Shit.
Hi.
Did you know Maxine?
Um, yeah-- yeah, a little.
Good.
I think he needs to talk to somebody who knew her.
Do you think you could just go and talk to him, maybe?
- Yeah.
- Thank you.
Uh...
I know it's hard, Mr. Fortenberry.
- How'd it happen?
- Huh?
How'd she die?
Um, well, you remember Vince McNeil?
- The orthodontist?
- Yeah.
Yeah, that's him.
Um... well, when the shit hit the fan at the BBG last week,
Mr. McNeil, he... got a bunch of the townsfolk all riled up, and together they took the law into their own hands.
Was my mama one of them?
No, that-- no.
No, she was not.
She-- she was one of the good folks.
Did you get the son of a bitch that did it to her?
Mm-hmm.
Yeah.
Yeah, I sure did.
Thank you, man.
Grandpa Niall?
You know I've been in a lot of situations lately.
I had plenty of good reasons to call on a fairy godfather, but I didn't... until now... 'cause I like to think of myself as strong.
But I ain't this strong.
If you're listening, Grandpa Niall,
I need you to materialize right here, right now.
You know what?
Fuck this.
Jesus Christ.
Niall.
Hi.
How do you make that wonderful spaghetti?
This is so good.
- Can we go now?
- No.
Food first.
One mustn't forget to nourish oneself.
Please, I don't know how much time he has left.
I understand, but if this munchkin doctor doesn't know how to heal him, what can I do?
You were watching?
I'm always watching you.
Do you know why she was so afraid of you, then?
We are royalty.
Dwarves have an innate fear of us.
Maybe because we killed so many of them in the past.
I just realized that if you're always watching... did you know I was infecting Bill when he was feeding off of me?
I did.
Why would you let me do that?
I don't like him.
You don't have to like him.
You're doing something for me.
What I meant was I don't like him for you.
Grandpa Niall, you say we're royalty, but other than the vampire-killing light ball that I can only use once, by the way,
I can't think of a single fuckin' = advantage in being what we are.
If you say that we're so fuckin' special,
I am asking you...
I'm begging you... prove it.
Use some of your magic for me.
Fine, Sookie.
I'll try.

Over here.
Oh, hey, Noomi.
Oh, God, I'm so glad you're here.
I feel so alone.
Huh.
Well, we all die alone.
What?
You're gonna die tonight.
See, Eric's coming for ya and there ain't no escaping it.
But I don't wanna die.
Well, that's just too fuckin' bad.
See, death comes for all of us, and your number's up.
No.
You're not real.
Maybe not, but death is.
Fuck off!
Yeah, I'll be sure to do that, then.
I'll see you in hell when I get there!
There is no hell.
You just try to convince yourself of that.
You don't even know--
Hold it together, Noomi.
You are one with the universe.
Keep it together.
Okay?
You know how on the news you see these-- these places get wiped out by tornados, but the people who live there are always vowing to rebuild on the exact same spot where tragedy took away everything they had?
I do.
Am I as crazy as they are?
I mean, is Nicole right?
Is this whole town crazy?
'Cause I love her and I wanna be a father to my baby girl, but... this ultimatum's got me.
Why can't I wrap my head around leaving this place?
I mean, at what point does the guy whose house keeps getting hit by a tornado call it a day, take his family, move someplace else?
I can't answer that for you, Sam.
Let me ask you a question.
Better pour me another one first.
I know you, Sam.
I know you better than I think you think I do, and so I know that you've spent your whole life running away from things.
Bon Temps's the only place you actually stopped and stuck it out.
I ain't heard a question yet.
If you left... do you think it would feel more like you were running from something or to something?
Let me put it another way.
If you stayed... could you be happy here without them?
When you can answer the question, you'll know what to do.
Are you happy here, Arlene?
I mean, with everything that's going on and--
I fake it.
See, my hope is the more I fake it, the more I'll believe it until the happiness becomes real.
But, no, Sam, I ain't happy.
But there ain't a chance in hell I'm gonna stop trying to be.
Bon Temps's where my life is.
Everyone I know and love is here.
Adilyn, it's Daddy.
- Wade?
- Okay, here.
I think I got keys in here somewhere.
What, he never changed the locks?
I'm guessing no.
See, even though he hates me, he's as lazy as shit.
What'd I tell you?
Hey, kids, if y'all aren't wearing any clothes, you better put some on 'cause we're coming in.
Wade, honey?
Wade?
Adilyn?
Shit.
Where are they?
I mean, there's only so many places they could've gone.
Does Adilyn have any friends or family on her mama's side that she could've gone to?
I don't know, some kind of fairy hangout or something?
Andy?
Baby, you crying, baby?
Something about how peaceful this lake looks, I guess, compared to this fucked-up reality we live in.
- I don't know.
- Oh, okay.
Hey, just take a breath.
Just breathe.
Oh, baby.
First you and then it's my baby girl, and I--
I'm trying to run around, keep y'all safe all the time.
I can't do it no more, Holly.
I'm sorry.
I know.
Oh, honey... of course you can't.
You're just a person.
It was bad enough that I wasn't there that night they took you, but now this-- now this is all on me.
- No.
- Yeah, Adilyn ran away, and that's all 'cause of me.
Hey, hey, that is not true, okay?
And we're gonna get her back.
I know it.
How?
Listen, Andy, I know you love me for a lot of reasons, and I know that my being a Wiccan ain't high up there on that list, but do you believe I'm an intuitive person?
Yeah.
Then you listen to me, Sheriff.
This story's gonna have a happy ending for us, okay?
I know it.
I promise it.
Are you kidding me?
Grandpa!
What's wrong?
We need to channel nature's memory here.
May I ask to what end?
Bill is inside the house.
How is channeling nature's memory gonna help?
History teaches us great lessons.
We need to look to it, find some answers.
Give me your hands.
Now, she will pull through, William.
-
- Mr. Compton, please come in.
Congratulations, Mr. Compton.
Hi, sweetheart.
She's perfect.
Wow.
Wow, what?
Didn't you think that was amazing?
I... guess?
Bill's wife gave birth.
So what?
"So what"?
Was I not clear before?
'Cause I thought I made myself perfectly clear when I said I was looking for a miracle.
- That was a miracle.
- Babies are born all the time.
That doesn't make it less miraculous.
There's magic in the ordinary, Sook.
There's magic in the things we can see.
Birth is a miracle.
Love is a miracle.
Death is a miracle.
Forgiveness is a miracle, especially if you can learn to forgive yourself.
Did you bring me here to Bill's house... just to trick me?
No, sweet orphan.
I brought you here because I wanted to give you some advice.
There are some things that can be fixed with magic.
But your vampire friend is not one of them.
I'm sorry.
Thank you for the life lesson.
Can you go now, please?

I'm no fool either, Sarah.
You lied to me.
You misled me.

Oh, my God.
Come on, Sarah.
You fornicated with him, too, didn't ya?
That makes four.
Why are you here?
I'm here because you're gonna die tonight, Sarah.
I'm here to give you a choice between heaven and hell because there's still time to save your soul.
There is no heaven, Noomi.
There is only the now and nothingness.
Nothingness?
What is nothingness?
I don't know what nothingness is!
Which is why Christianity is a way better deal!
No.
If you choose Jesus, your meeting with the Heavenly Father which takes place in the Risen Christ through the communion of the Holy Spirit awaits!
Follow the path, Noomi.
Die a Buddhist.
Fuck the path, Sarah.
Die a Christian.
Buddhist!
- Christian!
- Buddhist!
I choose neither!
I choose me!
I am the cure!
I am the messiah!
I choose myself.
That's a bad fuckin' call right there, Sarah.
You never could stand on your own two feet.
What was that?
What, you need me to spell it out for ya?
That's death coming for ya.

Okay.
I said "together." You are one stubborn chick.
I've got ya.
Okay, ready?
One, two, three.
There you go.
Yeah.
Got it?
Come on, Speed Racer.
Sorry.
Just keep the juice down, okay?
What's this?
What's what?
Okay, let's not get all dramatic about Dad, hmm?
He may have been our father, but he was never our dad.
He wasn't that bad.
Where was he when Mom got sick?
I don't know;
You don't know either.
He surely wasn't by her bedside.
Well, he had to work a lot.
I'm just saying, he was never around when shit got tough.
Yeah, well, it's not so easy, believe me.
I didn't mean it like that.
Just, sometimes we don't know why people do what they do, and we just have to keep moving.
Valerie.
Hey.
It might have been hard for him, but it's not for me.
I do this because I love you to death.
You could not get rid of me even if you tried.
You're not going anywhere either.
Hear me?
Miracles happen every day.
So we are going to remember that it is not over until it is over, and we are going to go get us some good news.
Simple as that.
Hmm?
Let's go.
Buck up, champ.
Hey, Valerie, Melissa, how are we doin'?
Hanging in there, hoping for the best.
All right, come on in.
The results aren't good.
The cancer has spread aggressively, no longer contained to the left breast.
It's everywhere... bone, organs, brain.
So when do we start chemo?
I'm sorry, Valerie.
We can do another round of chemo, though, right?
Quality of life should take precedence.
What are you talking about, "quality of life"?
I am sorry.
I can recommend a social worker to aid in hospice.
- She's not going to hospice.
- I can take care of her.
They have all kinds of things now.
They have tissue treatments in Germany, stem-cell replacement.
I just saw something about that last week.
Are a lot of options we can still look at.
Hmm?
I'm done.
What?
I'm done, Mel.
I just...
I feel like...
I've been running this marathon, and... there's no finish line.
I'm just ready to lay down and watch it all go by.
What?
Just, you don't have to stay until the end.
Don't even say that.
Look, you were always there to pick up the pieces for me.
And you might be able to chase Carter off, but you're not getting rid of me.
It's me and you, Val.
Till the end?
And beyond.
I got ya.
What's going on?
Okay?
What are you doing?
I'm not doing anything.
Okay.
Come on.
No.
Not now.
Oh, no.
Melissa?
Please?
Please?
In our next show, we'll talk with Dr. Xavier Reed to discuss his book Lost Time.
This is George Noory from Coast to Coast A...
Hello?
Valerie, this is Dr. Terry.
The test results are remarkable.
Valerie, are you there?
Yeah, I'm here.
Your rapid hair growth... it's all still a mystery.
The cancer, it's completely gone.
Yeah, and so is my sister.
If you could just come in for a few more tests...
I'm so sorry.
Carter, just tell me you have something new.
You feeling okay?
Yeah, I'm feeling okay.
Look, I've got something I want to give you.
I was thinking maybe tomorrow downtown.
Maybe have a coffee.
That'll work.
Okay, good.
Hey, listen, you try and get some rest, okay?
I'll see you tomorrow, baby.
See you tomorrow.
Steve, have you seen her?
Yeah, if you hear anything...
Okay.
Ryan, this is Valerie.
No.
Nothing.
The police don't have anything.
Not a single trace of her.
This is Valerie Dreyfuss.
I'm looking for my sister, Melissa.
No, I know.
Of course it doesn't make any sense.
That's why I'm trying everything here.
God!
Valerie.
Watch your sister.
Mr. Coffey?
What the hell are you doing in my apartment?
I was just taking out the trash, heard all kinds of noises.
I mean, I heard banging, groans coming from inside your unit.
Does it look like I need help?
Uh...
No.
Yeah, no.
Smoking in my apartment, Coffey?
Please.
Wait.
That's it?
Close the door on your way out.
What's up, girl?
You lose your kitty cat or something?
Huh?
Find some fucking scripts.
Huh?
What you got in this little bag?
Huh?
No!
No!
Relax.
Hurry up.
Find some scripts.
Shh!
Why don't you calm down, sweetheart?
Were just gonna take a little look through your bag.
No!
Candy out of that, huh?
Shut your fucking mouth, and we might just leave you alone.
Hey.
I like when you come in my neighborhood.
Leave her alone.
Oh!
You wanna go?
Yeah.
Huh?
You wanna fuck with me?
You're a big fucking man, huh?
I'm the wrong fucking man.
Yeah.
Huh?
Hey, hey.
You're okay.
It's okay.
What are you doing down here?
Hey, it's okay.
Come on.
Why?
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Downtown passing out flyers.
Alone?
At least I'm doing something.
You could have got yourself killed.
I'm gonna do whatever it takes.
No, that doesn't work for me.
Not anymore.
I care about you, Val, very much.
Stop it.
I can't.
Not until I find her.
Okay.
Why are you giving this to me?
It's all the notes we had on the case.
I thought it might...
help you.
You're kidding me.
I don't have a choice.
They want me off this case Val.
Melissa's gone.
I know.
There's got to be more.
Look, there's 12 hours of unaccounted time.
There's your statement and a missing person.
That's it.
They know how close we are.
It's the only reason you're not a suspect here.
Oh, come on, Carter, she's my sister.
Have you ever lost somebody before?
Sometimes you got to move on, Val.
Easier said than done.
She's out there.
I hope you're right.
I am right.
I know.
Come here.
We'll find her, baby.
We'll find her.
Go home.
Get some rest, okay?
You're going to make yourself sick again, Val, if you keep pushing yourself like this.
I got to go.
It's work.
I'm sorry.
Straight home, okay?
Okay.
You got my number.
If you need me...
Straight home.
Hey.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Come on.
You want to talk, baby?
I don't even know what to say.
Okay.
I just need you.
And I don't want to talk.
Be ready.
I just can't.
Baby, please don't do this again.
It's not fair.
Baby, don't, don't.
Hey, hey.
Don't do this again, okay?
Stay here.
Stay here.
I've just got to go.
Stay here.
Please?
I...
I just can't.
Lost Time.
I'm Dr. Xavier Reed.
I want you all to know, no matter how dark things seem, you are not alone.
Now, many of you may have had a close encounter.
You just don't remember when or where.
If you've experienced this trauma, like myself, you are desperate for answers.
The answers you seek and more will be revealed in my new book, Lost Time.
What is lost time?
So let me ask you, have you ever been watching TV, a film, or driving in your car, and you drifted off for what seemed like hours, only to snap out of it and realize it all happened in a blink of an eye?
Have you ever asked yourself,
"Where did the time go"?
St. Augustine said that time was a threefold present:
The present as we experience it, the past as a present memory, and the future as a present expectation.
Now, can any of you give me an example of how time may be shaped in the present?
Déjà vu.
Mm-hmm.
Anyone else?
Daydreams.
Daydreams.
That's correct.
Yes.
Nightmares.
Nightmares.
Déjà vu, daydreams, nightmares.
Are they figments of our imagination or memories too frightening to remember?
What would Valerie say?
You see, I was once like she was.
I didn't believe in anything
I couldn't touch, see, feel or smell... until that one moment
when I lost time.
I was driving in my car on the way to a ball game
when my life came to a grinding halt.
There was a...
a blinding light.
Then it was gone, and so was my wife, Lily.
Half a day passed in an instant.
Where did the time go?
Actually, the time didn't go anywhere.
You did.
You were raped of time, security, innocence.
Something so unique, so sacred, can never be returned.
Banished from paradise.
It's food for thought.
With that, I'd like to thank you all for coming,
and I invite you to get my book, which I hope provides some of the answers you seek.
Thank you.
Dr. Reed, you're great.
I'm your biggest fan.
Thank you.
What's your name?
Greg.
Here you go.
Thank you for coming.
Come here.
Take a look at the balcony up above.
Right there.
Keep your eye on him.
What are you doing here?
Waiting for an autograph.
You're following me.
No.
I love all this weird stuff.
Hey.
So, what, you're buying into this?
I need answers.
I know.
So this guy's gonna help you with that?
I don't know.
Maybe he might.
I worry about you.
Don't worry about me.
I'm just fine.
No, you're not.
Detective Carter.
Did you enjoy the presentation?
Yeah, that name thing...
That's cool.
I saw a guy do that once in Vegas.
Well, so did I, but that was a trick.
Dr. Reed...
Val.
It's okay.
Look, I'll be in touch tomorrow.
Okay.
Dr. Reed, wait.
I want answers.
I need to find my sister.
Your not ready for answers yet, Valerie.
Come to my sanctuary.
This is his sanctuary?
Good morning, Valerie.
You know who I am?
Dr. Reed told me to expect you.
You can call me Nurse Mary.
After you.
Uh, I need to talk to him.
That's not possible at the moment.
But I have questions.
If you insist upon staying and seeing the doctor, then it's at his time, not yours.
But can I see him soon?
All in good time, Miss Dreyfuss.
His sanctuary is completely cut off from the outside world.
No cell phones allowed.
It'll be returned when you leave.
I'm not staying overnight.
You can leave anytime you wish, Miss Dreyfuss.
The door is right behind me.
But our program does have its rules.
Thank you, Miss Dreyfuss.
Follow me.
Each guest has their own private room, and we encourage journaling to log your experiences.
It's all very safe.
Doesn't sound safe to me.
The doctor suggests that you each deal with your trauma in your own way.
What the fuck's your problem?
No problem.
Voices in my head...
too loud.
The doctor encourages this?
The doctor encourages self-expression and introspection.
Whatever helps you find your path towards your own truth.
Come along.
Your room is down the end of the hall.
I don't need a room.
Oh, just give it a night.
I'm not staying.
It is the only way you'll see Dr. Reed.
Mr. Elliot will come get you for group session.
Can I help you?
What are you doing here?
She's not here.
Mr. Coffey, have you seen her?
Yeah, she was here earlier, but she beat it early.
- I keep an eye on things.
- Yeah, of course you do.
This legal?
Jesus.
Yeah, I know.
She's not doing good, man.
You dropped something.
Yeah, this is Detective Bill Lance.
Hey, Bill, it's Carter.
Hey, Carter, how you doing?
Yeah, all good, man.
Look, I need a favor.
I need a location.
You are supposed to be in your room.
I'm s...
I'm sorry.
Do not worry.
Each has their own unique reaction to it all.
I'm Mr. Elliot.
Dr. Reed has asked for you.
This place been here a while?
Long time.
Easy to get lost.
You have no idea.
Thank you, Mr. Elliot.
Having visions with your sister again, Valerie?
Oh, what, now that Blondie's here, we can start?
Please, sit down.
You're all suffering from a type of post-traumatic stress.
You're part of a select group that I call "lost timers."
Pretty cool name.
I can dig it.
Right, girl?
I'm not your girl.
Next time you touch me will be your last.
Keep your hands to yourself, Rico.
This is not a self-help group or a 12-step program.
No touchy-feely here.
Now, you all have questions that you'd like answered.
I can do that for you.
Now, the work here will be difficult.
It will be direct and sometimes very painful, but it will lead to the answers you seek.
Oh, fuck!
Mary.
Thank you, Mary.
As you can see, you're all suffering from different symptoms.
Gillian...
Well, Gillian, she lives in the numina.
She operates on a higher frequency that causes her to tap into vibrational energy and hear voices.
And, of course, her nose bleeds.
Gale has synesthesia.
It's a type of M.S.
Her nerve endings are hypersensitive.
Everyone has their breaking point, which we're all here to avoid...
even you, Rico.
I will be helping each one of you with your symptoms.
Dr. Reed, it's time.
Well, we've made some progress today.
Please get some rest, and I'll see everyone in the morning.
I'm looking forward to working with all of you.
And remember, the door is always open.
You can leave anytime you want.
But if you leave, you can never come back again.
What the hell?
My shit's getting more fucked up by the day.
I need something.
You guys can circle-jerk.
I don't do this group thing.
Gale, what happened to you?
My partner...
We were on patrol.
Next thing you know, he's already dead.
His chest was all cut up.
They branded him with symbols.
I was suspended, pending an investigation.
Guess the LAPD don't believe in UFO's neither.
UFO's?
What do you think I'm dressed like this for?
'Cause you're vice?
Fuck you.
Because they messed with us.
The faintest light hurts my eyes.
The-The slightest smell turns my stomach.
I can hear a goddamn pin drop.
And I should...
What, they didn't fuck with you somehow?
Shit, my UTP is the best thing that has ever happened to me.
Before that, life was fucking boring.
It was all Leave It to Beaver shit.
Safe is no good.
Safe kills us inside.
They don't like safe.
Safe doesn't exist.
Who's "they"?
Safe fucking sucks.
You wouldn't believe the crazy shit I've done the last couple of months.
I just don't care no more.
Wife and kids up and left the moment the nightmares started.
Thought it was from Iraq, you know?
Hey, fuck it.
I'm single now, right?
That's it!
All right!
All right!
I'm sorry.
Release him, Gale.
To your room now.
Whatever.
Try that again, I'll break your fingers.
How's that?
Turns me on, actually.
And I suggest the two of you do the same.
You're in for a very long night.
Told you.
Shit gets more fucked up every day.
Whoa.
I mean, I've been really on edge.
Inoperable tumor, courtesy of them.
Aneurism could pop anytime.
How's that for "on edge"?
I'm sorry.
Yeah, well, whatever.
Fucking cancer, right?
See you in the morning unless we lose it before then.
Welcome to rock bottom.
I've been expecting you, Valerie.
Dr. Reed, I came here for answers, answers you said you could help me with.
And I will.
But the answers you seek are inside you.
I can only assist in helping you access them.
Then help me.
Why am I still alive?
Why was my sister...
Go on, say it, Valerie.
Why was she taken?
Abducted?
Is that what you want to say?
There's no evidence.
Where is the evidence?
No one has any answers...
not the police, not Carter...
And there won't be.
That's what makes this so delicate.
There are no forensics, no fingerprints.
Just flashes of an experience buried inside you.
It's why I suggested that you come here to a safe environment.
Away from those who want to keep you in the dark, in fear.
You have to let go of your fear to remember what happened.
How can I do that?
Surrender.
Let go of the illusions you're holding on to.
A new reality is created when you have full acceptance of this one.
Let me help you, and I promise the truth will come.
Yeah, hey, Bill, it's Carter.
Any luck with that address?
Still looking, Carter.
- I need it right away.
- This is for Valerie, okay?
But I like her.
She's nice.
She doesn't know yet.
Doesn't know about you.
Who's there?
I don't wanna go.
Let's start with her.
Valerie, Valerie, Valerie...
He's watching.
Who are you?
Be ready.
What the fuck?
Mel.
What's happening?
This is Carter.
Hey, what did you get?
You did?
Yeah, I got it.
Thanks for that.
Well, look, just don't tell him.
I don't care what the captain told you.
Just don't tell him.
Right.
Yeah.
Well, you know, look, if you don't hear from me you know it didn't go to plan.
No, she's a little more than that.
you know that.
Okay.
Thanks.
I'll be in touch.
Yeah, later.
No!
No!
No!
Aah!
No!
No.
Don't touch me.
No, not the... the kids.
Not my babies.
Want what's inside me.
Wants what's ours, but it's not to give.
It's not theirs.
No.
Oh, fuck!
It stopped!
Fucking batteries!
Fuck!
Oh, God!
No!
Stop it!
No!
No!
Oh, God!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
No, you can't.
No, you can't.
You can't, you can't, you can't, you can't do this!
You can't!
It's too much!
It's too much...
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
They killed her.
They did this to her.
We're getting out of here.
Are you lost?
I'm fine.
Valerie Dreyfuss...
where is she?
She wants to be here, Detective.
No one is leaving.
I don't think you understand.
She's leaving with me.
Now.
Where is she?
Here.
I'm not going to ask you again.
You came just for her.
How human.
Get out.
Get out of my head.
I said, go away.
Go away!
You go!
Go!
Go!
Get out of my head.
Go!
Fuck off!
We need to retrieve and harvest the Nubot.
Now.
Rico.
Rico.
Open the door.
Rico?
Nightmares.
This isn't happening!
It is happening.
He knew.
He knew we would do this.
My God.
Gillian!
What are you doing?
Eva?
No, Eva!
Boo-hoo.
I miss my sister.
It's all happening to me.
Me, me, me.
You're all so weak.
Eva is ours.
No.
Fight back, Eva.
Fight back!
She cannot.
You belong to him now.
You have a visitor.
Shh.
Why are you doing this?
Shh.
Daddy's coming.
What?
Where are we?
He needs you.
Did you miss me, sister?
You're not my sister.
You're ready now.
Why?
You are the strong one.
Unlike your sister.
Where is she?
Where is she?
Wake up!
Look who's here.
He came to save you, so we let him in.
Your hero.
It's the moment of reckoning, Valerie.
The answer to your question.
You've been prepped and readied.
You have one of these... they're called Nubots... inside you.
All your memories, your DNA, your entire essence, attaches on it.
You see, we're looking for what was removed from Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden before you took that bite out of the apple, and we're getting closer.
And since humans have the ability to elevate, to evolve, it must be developed, cultivated, and grown inside of you
to then be harvested and used by us.
The God gene.
It's the new Genesis.
Mr. Elliot.
Our race is dying.
There is no moral question here.
The Nubot inside you will carry your DNA through a portal to our world.
You will save our kind.
You'll feel the creature detach itself from your cervical spine.
It will be excruciating.
But then it'll be over,
and you will rest... forever.
Shh.
Baby...
What have they done to you, baby?
What have they done to you?
Baby, just breathe.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Stay with me, baby.
I love you, baby.
It's okay.
It's all right.
Baby, baby...
Baby, it's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay it's okay, it's okay.
Come on, baby.
Baby, we've got to get you dressed.
Okay?
We got to get you out of here.
Come on.
Get you out of here.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, baby.
We gotta go.
We gotta go, okay?
I got to get you out of here.
Okay?
Get out out of here.
Come on, baby.
Come on.
I got you.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Carter, I got this.
Are you sure?
I'm good.
Let's go.
Okay.
Let's go.
I got you.
Come on.
It's okay.
Come on!
Okay.
Stay with me, baby.
Stay with me.
Stay with me.
Stay with me.
Come on.
Stay close to me, baby.
Come on, baby!
Wait!
Eva!
Eva!
Wait, Carter.
We have to go get Eva.
Who the fuck is Eva?
She's just a girl.
We have to go back.
I got to get you out.
Come on.
No, wait!
Wait, please!
We've got to go get her.
Please.
I can't leave her here.
Where is she?
She's in her room.
Please.
Okay, come on.
Come on.
Come on.
My name is Eva Serling.
I won't let them beat me.
I'll fight back.
Illuminati.
Evil...
Illuminati.
Illuminati.
Evil...
Illuminati.
Eva?
Hi, honey.
Hi.
Come on.
Valerie?
He's gonna help us get out.
Come on.
We've got to go.
We're gonna go home.
We're gonna get you home.
Remember your home?
Baby, baby, we're not gonna hurt you.
We're gonna get you out of here, okay?
Gonna get you out.
You stay with Valerie, okay?
No!
No!
No, no, no!
No!
You lose everyone you love.
No!
Run.
Forgive me.
Fuck!
No!
You disappoint me.
What happened to us?
My gift to you.
Someone help...
Val!
Val!
What's happening?
Mel, Mel, they-they...
they're doing...
What?
They c...
They cut me open.
Where?
Where?
Where?
Show me!
Hurts.
Oh, it hurts.
Whoa.
It's them.
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
My beautiful sister.
I'm already dead.
Listen to me.
You have to live for both of us.
Yes.
No.
What are you talking about?
I'm here with you till the end.
And beyond?
Always.
Always.
No!
You were supposed to take me,
OT my sister.
Why did you send me back?
Because your genetic code is more advanced.
Why don't we finish what we began?
Hello, Reed.
Miss me?
Still playing doctor?
Still searching for paradise?
Still trying to elevate, to change?
Shouldn't we all be?
Don't trust anyone, Valerie.
She's under our protection now.
Protection or captivity?
What protection?
What...
It's over.
How...
How is this possible?
It feels so real.
That's because it is real.
You two are something special.
We know because we watch all of you.
Valerie, are you ready to let her go?
We had some beautiful moments, didn't we?
Better than most.
And then it ends.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Goodbye, Melissa.
No one is ever gone.
Can he come back?
Probably.
And your kind?
We're just here, watching... and waiting.
For what?
For you to open the door and walk through it.
Where are we?
You changed the outcome.
Now you need to go back.
The outcome?
Reed.
We need to stop their kind.
Valerie, there are multiple outcomes you can experience.
Every possible experience will happen in other dimensions.
All these parallel universes occupy the same space, but in different dimensions.
A very small difference in a choice or thought
can change the whole world.
Will change the outcome.
Your outcome.
Just like the tiny butterfly that flaps its wings..
And makes the hurricane.
We all play our part.
I'm playing my part by sending you back to another dimension.
You understand.
Are you ready?
Go.
Eva!
Valerie?
We're not gonna hurt you.
No!
No!
What did you do?
What did you do?
She was going to kill you.
What do you mean?
Her body's mine.
Run.
Go.
Go.
Now!
Move!
Come on!
Move.
Come on, this way.
Come on, baby!
Move!
Baby,
I don't know if we're gonna make it out of here.
We're gonna keep running.
You understand me?
Go!
Go!
Carter!
Hello, Lieutenant.
Hey.
Have you been waiting a long time?
A while.
Mm.
You look beautiful.
Thank you.
You ready?
No.
Come on, let's go do this thing.
Okay.
You feel okay?
Yeah.
Oh, come on.
You invited Coffey to this thing?
Come on, be nice.
Oh, come on.
Hey.
Hi.
Thank you so much for being here.
Oh, for sure.
I mean, wow, what a party.
And you, congratulations on your promotion.
Thank you, Mr. Coffey.
Thanks for coming.
- Carter.
- John, how are you?
Good.
Good to see you.
Congratulations on the promotion.
Thank you for everything you did on the case, okay?
Really appreciate it.
No problem.
That's what I do.
I'll be back in a minute.
Okay.
See you soon.
Let me introduce you to my wife.
Hi.
Pleasure.
Nice to meet you.
I miss her being around.
Is she doing okay?
Yeah, she's getting there.
Thanks for everything you did.
Thanks for sticking around and keeping an eye on things.
I really appreciate it.
Did you find the answers you were looking for?
Hello, Valerie.
Saved your hero?
You have what I need;
I have what you want:
Your sister.
It's time.
Hey, hey, just breathe, okay?
Shit, shit.
I got you.
Come on, Val, just relax.
Come on, Val, just breathe.
Just relax.
I'm right here, okay?
You're going to be okay.
Your sis is right here.
Got ya.
Thank you.
Sweet Jesus.
Okay.
Just don't say something silly like, I don't know,
"Morning, sunshine" or something.
I wasn't, I wasn't.
Hey, we should get going.
Beat traffic.
We're going to do this together, okay?
Let me see here.
Okay.
I said "together." You are one stubborn chick.
I've got ya.
Okay, ready?
One, two, three.
There you go.
Yeah.
Got it?
Come on, Speed Racer.
Sorry.
Just keep the juice down, okay?
What's this?
What's what?
Okay, let's not get all dramatic about Dad, hmm?
He may have been our father, but he was never our dad.
He wasn't that bad.
Where was he when Mom got sick?
I don't know;
you don't know either.
He surely wasn't by her bedside.
Well, he had to work a lot.
I'm just saying, he was never around when shit got tough.
Yeah, well, it's not so easy, believe me.
I didn't mean it like that.
Just, sometimes we don't know why people do what they do, and we just have to keep moving.
Valerie.
Hey.
It might have been hard for him, but it's not for me.
I do this because I love you to death.
You could not get rid of me even if you tried.
You're not going anywhere either.
Hear me?
Miracles happen every day.
So we are going to remember that it is not over until it is over, and we are going to go get us some good news.
Simple as that.
Hmm?
Let's go.
Buck up, champ.
Hey, Valerie, Melissa, how are we doin'?
Hanging in there, hoping for the best.
All right, come on in.
The results aren't good.
The cancer has spread aggressively, o longer contained to the left breast.
It's everywhere-- bone, organs, brain.
So when do we start chemo?
I'm sorry, Valerie.
We can do another round of chemo, though, right?
Quality of life should take precedence.
What are you talking about, "quality of life"?
I am sorry.
I can recommend a social worker to aid in hospice.
- She's not going to hospice.
- I can take care of her.
They have all kinds of things now.
They have tissue treatments in Germany, stem-cell replacement.
I just saw something about that last week.
Are a lot of options we can still look at.
Hmm?
I'm done.
What?
I'm done, Mel.
I just...
I feel like...
I've been running this marathon, and... there's no finish line.
I'm just ready to lay down and watch it all go by.
What?
Just, you don't have to stay until the end.
Don't even say that.
Look, you were always there to pick up the pieces for me.
And you might be able to chase Carter off, but you're not getting rid of me.
It's me and you, Val.
Till the end?
And beyond.
I got ya.
What's going on?
Okay?
What are you doing?
I'm not doing anything.
Okay.
Come on.
No.
Not now.
Oh, no.
Melissa?
Please?
Please?
In our next show, we'll talk with Dr. Xavier Reed to discuss his book LostTime.
This is George Noory from Coast to Coast A--
Hello?
Valerie, this is Dr. Terry.
The test results are remarkable.
Valerie, are you there?
Yeah, I'm here.
Your rapid hair growth-- it's all still a mystery.
The cancer, it's completely gone.
Yeah, and so is my sister.
If you could just come in for a few more tests...
I'm so sorry.
Carter, just tell me you have something new.
You feeling okay?
Yeah, I'm feeling okay.
Look, I've got something I want to give you.
I was thinking maybe tomorrow downtown.
Maybe have a coffee.
That'll work.
Okay, good.
Hey, listen, you try and get some rest, okay?
I'll see you tomorrow, baby.
See you tomorrow.
Steve, have you seen her?
Yeah, if you hear anything...
Okay.
Ryan, this is Valerie.
No.
Nothing.
The police don't have anything.
Not a single trace of her.
This is Valerie Dreyfuss.
I'm looking for my sister, Melissa.
No, I know.
Of course it doesn't make any sense.
That's why I'm trying everything here.
God!
Valerie.
Watch your sister.
Mr. Coffey?
What the hell are you doing in my apartment?
I was just taking out the trash, heard all kinds of noises.
I mean, I heard banging, groans coming from inside your unit.
Does it look like I need help?
Uh...
No.
Yeah, no.
Smoking in my apartment, Coffey?
Please.
Wait.
That's it?
Close the door on your way out.
What's up, girl?
You lose your kitty cat or something?
Huh?
Find some fucking scripts.
Huh?
What you got in this little bag?
Huh?
No!
No!
Relax.
Hurry up.
Find some scripts.
Shh!
Why don't you calm down, sweetheart?
Were just gonna take a little look through your bag.
No!
Candy out of that, huh?
Shut your fucking mouth, and we might just leave you alone.
Hey.
I like when you come in my neighborhood.
Leave her alone.
Oh!
You wanna go?
Yeah.
Huh?
You wanna fuck with me?
You're a big fucking man, huh?
I'm the wrong fucking man.
Yeah.
Huh?
Hey, hey.
You're okay.
It's okay.
What are you doing down here?
Hey, it's okay.
Come on.
Why?
Why are you doing this to yourself?
Downtown passing out flyers.
Alone?
At least I'm doing something.
You could have got yourself killed.
I'm gonna do whatever it takes.
No, that doesn't work for me.
Not anymore.
I care about you, Val, very much.
Stop it.
I can't.
Not until I find her.
Okay.
Why are you giving this to me?
It's all the notes we had on the case.
I thought it might...
help you.
You're kidding me.
I don't have a choice.
They want me off this case Val.
Melissa's gone.
I know.
There's got to be more.
Look, there's 12 hours of unaccounted time.
There's your statement and a missing person.
That's it.
They know how close we are.
It's the only reason you're not a suspect here.
Oh, come on, Carter, she's my sister.
Have you ever lost somebody before?
Sometimes you got to move on, Val.
Easier said than done.
She's out there.
I hope you're right.
I am right.
I know.
Come here.
We'll find her, baby.
We'll find her.
Go home.
Get some rest, okay?
You're going to make yourself sick again, Val, if you keep pushing yourself like this.
I got to go.
It's work.
I'm sorry.
Straight home, okay?
Okay.
You got my number.
If you need me...
Straight home.
Hey.
It's okay.
It's okay.
Come on.
You want to talk, baby?
I don't even know what to say.
Okay.
I just need you.
And I don't want to talk.
Be ready.
I just can't.
Baby, please don't do this again.
It's not fair.
Baby, don't, don't.
Hey, hey.
Don't do this again, okay?
Stay here.
Stay here.
I've just got to go.
Stay here.
Please?
I-
- I just can't.
Lost Time.
I'm Dr. Xavier Reed.
I want you all to knownno matter how dark things seem, you are not alone.
Now, many of you may have had a close encounter.
You just don't remember when or where.
If you've experienced this trauma, like myself, you are desperate for answers.
The answers you seek and more will be revealed in my new book, Lost Time.
What is lost time?
So let me ask you, have you ever been watching TV, a film, or driving in your car, and you drifted off for what seemed like hours, only to snap out of it and realize it all happened in a blink of an eye?
Have you ever asked yourself,
"Where did the time go"?
St. Augustine said that time was a threefold present:
the present as we experience it, the past as a present memory, and the future as a present expectation.
Now, can any of you give me an example of how time may be shaped in the present?
Déjà vu.
Mm-hmm.
Anyone else?
Daydreams.
Daydreams.
That's correct.
Yes.
Nightmares.
Nightmares.
Déjà vu, daydreams, nightmares.
Are they figments of our imagination or memories too frightening to remember?
What would Valerie say?
You see, I was once like she was.
I didn't believe in anything
I couldn't touch, see, feel or smell... until that one moment
when I lost time.
I was driving in my car on the way to a ball game
when my life came to a grinding halt.
There was a...
a blinding light.
Then it was gone, and so was my wife, Lily.
Half a day passed in an instant.
Where did the time go?
Actually, the time didn't go anywhere.
You did.
You were raped of time, security, innocence.
Something so unique, so sacred, can never be returned.
Banished from paradise.
It's food for thought.
With that, I'd like to thank you all for coming,
and I invite you to get my book, which I hope provides some of the answers you seek.
Thank you.
Dr. Reed, you're great.
I'm your biggest fan.
Thank you.
What's your name?
Greg.
Here you go.
Thank you for coming.
Come here.
Take a look at the balcony up above.
Right there.
Keep your eye on him.
What are you doing here?
Waiting for an autograph.
You're following me.
No.
I love all this weird stuff.
Hey.
So, what, you're buying into this?
I need answers.
I know.
So this guy's gonna help you with that?
I don't know.
Maybe he might.
I worry about you.
Don't worry about me.
I'm just fine.
No, you're not.
Detective Carter.
Did you enjoy the presentation?
Yeah, that name thing--
That's cool.
I saw a guy do that once in Vegas.
Well, so did I, but that was a trick.
Dr. Reed...
Val.
It's okay.
Look, I'll be in touch tomorrow.
Okay.
Dr. Reed, wait.
I want answers.
I need to find my sister.
Your not ready for answers yet, Valerie.

This is his sanctuary?
Good morning, Valerie.
You know who I am?
Dr. Reed told me to expect you.
You can call me Nurse Mary.
After you.
Uh, I need to talk to him.
That's not possible at the moment.
But I have questions.
If you insist upon staying and seeing the doctor, then it's at his time, not yours.
But can I see him soon?
All in good time, Miss Dreyfuss.
His sanctuary is completely cut off from the outside world.
No cell phones allowed.
It'll be returned when you leave.
I'm not staying overnight.
You can leave anytime you wish, Miss Dreyfuss.
The door is right behind me.
But our program does have its rules.
Thank you, Miss Dreyfuss.
Follow me.
Each guest has their own private room, and we encourage journaling to log your experiences.
It's all very safe.
Doesn't sound safe to me.
The doctor suggests that you each deal with your trauma in your own way.
What the fuck's your problem?
No problem.
Voices in my head...
too loud.
The doctor encourages this?
The doctor encourages self-expression and introspection.
Whatever helps you find your path towards your own truth.
Come along.
Your room is down the end of the hall.
I don't need a room.
Oh, just give it a night.
I'm not staying.
It is the only way you'll see Dr. Reed.
Mr. Elliot will come get you for group session.
Can I help you?
What are you doing here?
She's not here.
Mr. Coffey, have you seen her?
Yeah, she was here earlier, but she beat it early.
- I keep an eye on things.
- Yeah, of course you do.
This legal?
Jesus.
Yeah, I know.
She's not doing good, man.
You dropped something.
Yeah, this is Detective Bill Lance.
Hey, Bill, it's Carter.
Hey, Carter, how you doing?
Yeah, all good, man.
Look, I need a favor.
I need a location.
You are supposed to be in your room.
I'm s...
I'm sorry.
Do not worry.
Each has their own unique reaction to it all.
I'm Mr. Elliot.
Dr. Reed has asked for you.
This place been here a while?
Long time.
Easy to get lost.
You have no idea.
Thank you, Mr. Elliot.
Having visions with your sister again, Valerie?
Oh, what, now that Blondie's here, we can start?
Please, sit down.
You're all suffering from a type of post-traumatic stress.
You're part of a select group that I call "lost timers."
Pretty cool name.
I can dig it.
Right, girl?
I'm not your girl.
Next time you touch me will be your last.
Keep your hands to yourself, Rico.
This is not a self-help group or a 12-step program.
No touchy-feely here.
Now, you all have questions that you'd like answered.
I can do that for you.
Now, the work here will be difficult.
It will be direct and sometimes very painful, but it will lead to the answers you seek.
Oh, fuck!
Mary.
Thank you, Mary.
As you can see, you're all suffering from different symptoms.
Gillian...
Well, Gillian, she lives in the numina.
She operates on a higher frequency that causes her to tap into vibrational energy and hear voices.
And, of course, her nose bleeds.
Gale has synesthesia.
It's a type of M.S.
Her nerve endings are hypersensitive.
Everyone has their breaking point, which we're all here to avoid-- even you, Rico.
I will be helping each one of you with your symptoms.
Dr. Reed, it's time.
Well, we've made some progress today.
Please get some rest, and I'll see everyone in the morning.
I'm looking forward to working with all of you.
And remember, the door is always open.
You can leave anytime you want.
But if you leave, you can never come back again.
What the hell?
My shit's getting more fucked up by the day.
I need something.
You guys can circle-jerk.
I don't do this group thing.
Gale, what happened to you?
My partner...
We were on patrol.
Next thing you know, he's already dead.
His chest was all cut up.
They branded him with symbols.
I was suspended, pending an investigation.
Guess the LAPD don't believe in UFO's neither.
UFO's?
What do you think I'm dressed like this for?
'Cause you're vice?
Fuck you.
Because they messed with us.
The faintest light hurts my eyes.
The-The slightest smell turns my stomach.
I can hear a goddamn pin drop.
And I should...
What, they didn't fuck with you somehow?
Shit, my UTP is the best thing that has ever happened to me.
Before that, life was fucking boring.
It was all Leave It to Beaver shit.
Safe is no good.
Safe kills us inside.
They don't like safe.
Safe doesn't exist.
Who's "they"?
Safe fucking sucks.
You wouldn't believe the crazy shit I've done the last couple of months.
I just don't care no more.
Wife and kids up and left the moment the nightmares started.
Thought it was from Iraq, you know?
Hey, fuck it.
I'm single now, right?
That's it!
All right!
All right!
I'm sorry.
Release him, Gale.
To your room now.
Whatever.
Try that again, I'll break your fingers.
How's that?
Turns me on, actually.
And I suggest the two of you do the same.
You're in for a very long night.
Told you.
Shit gets more fucked up every day.
Whoa.
I mean, I've been really on edge.
Inoperable tumor, courtesy of them.
Aneurism could pop anytime.
How's that for "on edge"?
I'm sorry.
Yeah, well, whatever.
Fucking cancer, right?
See you in the morning unless we lose it before then.
Welcome to rock bottom.
I've been expecting you, Valerie.
Dr. Reed, I came here for answers, answers you said you could help me with.
And I will.
But the answers you seek are inside you.
I can only assist in helping you access them.
Then help me.
Why am I still alive?
Why was my sister...
Go on, say it, Valerie.
Why was she taken?
Abducted?
Is that what you want to say?
There's no evidence.
Where is the evidence?
No one has any answers-- not the police, not Carter--
And there won't be.
That's what makes this so delicate.
There are no forensics, no fingerprints.
Just flashes of an experience buried inside you.
It's why I suggested that you come here to a safe environment.
Away from those who want to keep you in the dark, in fear.
You have to let go of your fear to remember what happened.
How can I do that?
Surrender.
Let go of the illusions you're holding on to.
A new reality is created when you have full acceptance of this one.
Let me help you, and I promise the truth will come.
Yeah, hey, Bill, it's Carter.
Any luck with that address?
Still looking, Carter.
- I need it right away.
- This is for Valerie, okay?
But I like her.
She's nice.
She doesn't know yet.
Doesn't know about you.
Who's there?
I don't wanna go.
Let's start with her.
Valerie, Valerie, Valerie...
He's watching.
Who are you?
Be ready.
What the fuck?
Mel.
What's happening?
This is Carter.
Hey, what did you get?
You did?
Yeah, I got it.
Thanks for that.
Well, look, just don't tell him.
I don't care what the captain told you.
Just don't tell him.
Right.
Yeah.
Well, you know, look, if you don't hear from me you know it didn't go to plan.
No, she's a little more than that.
you know that.
Okay.
Thanks.
I'll be in touch.
Yeah, later.
No!
No!
No!
Aah!
No!
No.
Don't touch me.
No, not the... the kids.
Not my babies.
Want what's inside me.
Wants what's ours, but it's not to give.
It's not theirs.
No.
Oh, fuck!
It stopped!
Fucking batteries!
Fuck!
Oh, God!
No!
Stop it!
No!
No!
Oh, God!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Go!
No, you can't.
No, you can't.
You can't, you can't, you can't, you can't do this!
You can't!
It's too much!
It's too much-- Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
Shut up!
They killed her.
They did this to her.
We're getting out of here.
Are you lost?
I'm fine.
Valerie Dreyfuss-- where is she?
She wants to be here, Detective.
No one is leaving.
I don't think you understand.
She's leaving with me.
Now.
Where is she?
Here.
I'm not going to ask you again.
You came just for her.
How human.
Get out.
Get out of my head.
I said, go away.
Go away!
You go!
Go!
Go!
Get out of my head.
Go!
Fuck off!
We need to retrieve and harvest the Nubot.
Now.
Rico.
Rico.
Open the door.
Rico?
Nightmares.
This isn't happening!
It is happening.
He knew.
He knew we would do this.
My God.
Gillian!
What are you doing?
Eva?
No, Eva!
Boo-hoo.
I miss my sister.
It's all happening to me.
Me, me, me.
You're all so weak.
Eva is ours.
No.
Fight back, Eva.
Fight back!
She cannot.
You belong to him now.
You have a visitor.
Shh.
Why are you doing this?
Shh.
Daddy's coming.
What?
Where are we?
He needs you.
Did you miss me, sister?
You're not my sister.
You're ready now.
Why?
You are the strong one.
Unlike your sister.
Where is she?
Where is she?
Wake up!
Look who's here.
He came to save you, so we let him in.
Your hero.
It's the moment of reckoning, Valerie.
The answer to your question.
You've been prepped and readied.
You have one of these-- they're called Nubots-- inside you.
All your memories, your DNA, your entire essence, attaches on it.
You see, we're looking for what was removed from Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden before you took that bite out of the apple, and we're getting closer.
And since humans have the ability to elevate, to evolve, it must be developed, cultivated, and grown inside of you
to then be harvested and used by us.
The God gene.
It's the new Genesis.
Mr. Elliot.
Our race is dying.
There is no moral question here.
The Nubot inside you will carry your DNA through a portal to our world.
You will save our kind.
You'll feel the creature detach itself from your cervical spine.
It will be excruciating.
But then it'll be over,
and you will rest... forever.
Shh.
Baby...
What have they done to you, baby?
What have they done to you?
Baby, just breathe.
Everything's gonna be okay.
Stay with me, baby.
I love you, baby.
It's okay.
It's all right.
Baby, baby...
Baby, it's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay.
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay it's okay, it's okay.
Come on, baby.
Baby, we've got to get you dressed.
Okay?
We got to get you out of here.
Come on.
Get you out of here.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on, baby.
We gotta go.
We gotta go, okay?
I got to get you out of here.
Okay?
Get out out of here.
Come on, baby.
Come on.
I got you.
Come on.
Come on.
Come on.
Carter, I got this.
Are you sure?
I'm good.
Let's go.
Okay.
Let's go.
I got you.
Come on.
It's okay.
Come on!
Okay.
Stay with me, baby.
Stay with me.
Stay with me.
Stay with me.
Come on.
Stay close to me, baby.
Come on, baby!
Wait!
Eva!
Eva!
Wait, Carter.
We have to go get Eva.
Who the fuck is Eva?
She's just a girl.
We have to go back.
I got to get you out.
Come on.
No, wait!
Wait, please!
We've got to go get her.
Please.
I can't leave her here.
Where is she?
She's in her room.
Please.
Okay, come on.
Come on.
Come on.
My name is Eva Serling.
I won't let them beat me.
I'll fight back.
Illuminati.
Evil...
Illuminati.
Illuminati.
Evil...
Illuminati.
Eva?
Hi, honey.
Hi.
Come on.
Valerie?
He's gonna help us get out.
Come on.
We've got to go.
We're gonna go home.
We're gonna get you home.
Remember your home?
Baby, baby, we're not gonna hurt you.
We're gonna get you out of here, okay?
Gonna get you out.
You stay with Valerie, okay?
No!
No!
No, no, no!
No!
You lose everyone you love.
No!
Run.
Forgive me.
Fuck!
No!
You disappoint me.
What happened to us?
My gift to you.
Someone help...
Val!
Val!
What's happening?
Mel, Mel, they-they-- they're doing--
What?
They c-- They cut me open.
Where?
Where?
Where?
Show me!
Hurts.
Oh, it hurts.
Whoa.
It's them.
Listen to me.
Listen to me.
My beautiful sister.
I'm already dead.
Listen to me.
You have to live for both of us.
Yes.
No.
What are you talking about?
I'm here with you till the end.
And beyond?
Always.
Always.
No!
You were supposed to take me, ot my sister.
Why did you send me back?
Because your genetic code is more advanced.
Why don't we finish what we began?
Hello, Reed.
Miss me?
Still playing doctor?
Still searching for paradise?
Still trying to elevate, to change?
Shouldn't we all be?
Don't trust anyone, Valerie.
She's under our protection now.
Protection or captivity?
What protection?
What...
It's over.
How...
How is this possible?
It feels so real.
That's because it is real.
You two are something special.
We know because we watch all of you.
Valerie, are you ready to let her go?
We had some beautiful moments, didn't we?
Better than most.
And then it ends.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Goodbye, Melissa.
No one is ever gone.
Can he come back?
Probably.
And your kind?
We're just here, watching... and waiting.
For what?
For you to open the door and walk through it.
Where are we?
You changed the outcome.
Now you need to go back.
The outcome?
Reed.
We need to stop their kind.
Valerie, there are multiple outcomes you can experience.
Every possible experience will happen in other dimensions.
All these parallel universes occupy the same space, but in different dimensions.
A very small difference in a choice or thought
can change the whole world.
Will change the outcome.
Your outcome.
Just like the tiny butterfly that flaps its wings..
and makes the hurricane.
We all play our part.
I'm playing my part by sending you back to another dimension.
You understand.
Are you ready?
Go.
Eva!
Valerie?
We're not gonna hurt you.
No!
No!
What did you do?
What did you do?
She was going to kill you.
What do you mean?
Her body's mine.
Run.
Go.
Go.
Now!
Move!
Come on!
Move.
Come on, this way.
Come on, baby!
Move!
Baby,
I don't know if we're gonna make it out of here.
We're gonna keep running.
You understand me?
Go!
Go!
Carter!

I don't give a shit!
I am not going with you.
I would rather die than get in that coffin!
You will do what your maker tells you to do.
He may be my maker, but he sure as fuck didn't raise me.
Tara did.
She was the one who taught me how to feed, how to control my impulses.
He left, and then you left her when we needed you most.
We have bigger fucking problems than your mommy and your daddy--
- She died because of you!
- I am sorry--
Enough!
You're right.
I've been a terrible maker to you.
And for that I am truly sorry.
But I do not regret turning you, and I'm proud to call you my progeny.
Why did you come back for me?
Pam and I are gonna kill Sarah Newlin before I meet the true death.
You can count me out.
She was practically your stepmother, Willa.
If you have any idea where she might be,
I need to know it.
- I'm not going with you.
- Like fuck you aren't.
But I will tell you what I know if you release me.
Willa Burrell,
I renounce the ties of our blood and my dominion over you as my progeny.
As your maker...
I release you.
Like being kicked in the cooch by a wallaby, isn't it?
Sarah has a sister.
Oh, no shit, Willa.
The whole world knows that.
- You'd better know more.
- Her name is Amber.
Amber Mills.
And she's a vampire.
Oh.
How the fuck could Sarah Newlin have a vampire sister and the world not know about it?
I don't know, but I overheard her one night on the phone at the governor's mansion.
Sarah was warning her never to call there again or my father would send her to camp.
Any idea where this Amber lives?
The call came from a Dallas area code.
Good girl.
Ginger?
Tell the driver we're heading for Dallas.
And we'll only be needing two travel coffins.
What?
No!
You just got back.
And if you walk out that door,
I ain't never gonna see you again, am I?
Take me with you.
Put me in the third coffin.
- Sorry.
- What-- you're sorry?
I have been your sex slave for 15 years, Eric Northman, and we ain't never had sex.
Blow job, hand job, nothing.
Do you know what a sex slave is without the sex?
A slave?
Now, you are taking me with you to Dallas.
And if you can't fucking take me, then you had better fuckin' fuck me before you go.
Ginger, I'm diseased.
So the fuck am I!
No!

Sook?
Hey.
Hey.
I came as soon as I heard.
Ab-- about Alcide?
About everything.
How is you holding up?
The house is so empty.
Well, that big man of yours did take up a lot of space.
- Sorry.
- No, I'm sorry, Sook.
I gotta clean up.
- Jackson will be here in the morning.
- No, don't worry about that.
- We'll take care of this.
- No, what you need is some sleep.
When's the last time you got some serious shut-eye?
Come on, let me put you to bed.
Lafayette?
Yes, ma'am?
Don't leave.
Sook, I will be here when you wake up.
So don't fret, 'kay?
Night-night.
What the hell?
Look who's up.
- Where's all his--
- In the truck.
When Alcide's mama died, the hardest part was going through all her things.
You just say when you wanna go through it all, when you feel you're ready, and Jenny and me will have you out to the place and we'll figure it all out.
Yeah, we'll figure it out.
Hey!
The undead has arisen.
- Hey, there, Sookie.
- How'd you sleep?
Lafayette, you wanna tell me why there's enough food to choke a horse on my dining room table?
Child, me and Jenny was bustin' our humps cooking' all the livelong day.
Well, that's-- that's real sweet, but I can't eat all this.
There's enough food here to feed the whole town off of.
Well... the whole town will be here.
- What?
- Uh-huh.
Wait, are-- are y'all throwing a party?
- Yeah!
- Sookie, come on.
In my house?
The day after--
I know what you're probably thinking, honey.
But death doesn't have to be such a sad thing.
Actually, it does.
Death is inherently sad.
I'm sad.
I'm not in the mood for a party.
Sook.
Sook!
Sook, what did you say last night when you came home?
About how this house was feeling so empty?
That's why we're gonna fill it up, so we can say "fuck you," to death and "hello," to life.
- Yeah.
- And that's what we're doing.
We are motherfucking celebrating life.
I'm going back to sleep.
What would Tara want?
What would Alcide want?
Alcide would want people to be around you tonight, Sookie.
Yes, ma'am, so take that pretty little ass of yours upstairs and get presentable.
'Cause folk gonna be here soon with some top-shelf alcohol, and I got one restriction-- not a nan person come up to you and say, "Oh, I'm sorry for your loss."
Mm-mm, none of that bullshit.
- Hear, hear, I say.
- That's right.
Come on, hooker.
Let's bring out the rest of the vittles and bits.
And that chicken Jenny made.
It ain't as good as mine.
Sookie?
Ugh, this is not happening.
- Am I early?
- Why, do I not look ready?
You know what, actually, best not answer that.
I only just now found out about the party I'm hosting tonight.
I see.
Um...
I didn't have any alcohol on hand, as requested.
My mother always taught me it was ungentlemanly to turn up to a gathering empty-handed, so, uh, I brought you these.
Well, I guess I'd better go upstairs and put my face on, but in the meantime, I invite you in.
Amber Mills?
Who are you?
I was always the black sheep of the family.
Started fangbanging right outta high school while Little Miss Perfect's marrying Steven Newlin.
She's not here.
Just like I told you she wasn't.
We had to be sure.
Your boyfriend?
Jeremy.
He was the one that turned me.
He helped me get my shit together.
But the second I turn, Sarah freaks.
She's married into the Fellowship of the Sun, after all.
But she knows I'm broke, so she starts paying me off, a monthly cash delivery to stay in the coffin.
Then she goes out and she tells the world that her sister was taken from her by those evil vampires, that I disappeared into thin air.
But I was here the whole time.
Jeremy and me sittin' around watching "House Hunters" marathons and drinkin' Tru Blood.
What happened to Jeremy?
Same thing that's happening to us.
One day, he gets the veins.
A few months later, he's dying in my arms.
Sometimes I beat myself up over it.
I mean, if I hadn't taken her money, if I had come out instead of hiding--
She would've had you killed and kept on walking.
None of this is your fault.
It's your sister's, which is why Pam and I are going after her.
And will you help us find her?
Are you gonna kill her?
There's a real good chance that's the way it's gonna go down.
Then you can count me in.
Mm.
I like her.
I like you.
Is it all right if I haven't made up my mind about you yet?
Yeah, I really like her.
When's the last time you saw Sarah?
Oh, it's been years now.
But she did call here this morning.
She said she just got to Dallas and she needed a place to hide.
I told her to fuck off.
She's in Dallas.
Any idea where else she might've gone?
Where she always goes, to Mommy and Daddy.
Even though she disgraced the family, they always fall for her BS.
And where do Mommy and Daddy live?
Why, Preston Hollow, of course.
But they won't be home tonight.
Probably already left for this.
The second I told her that's where Mommy and Daddy were going, she hung up.
She'll be there.
Looks like we're going to a gala.
Do you have a picture of your parents I can borrow?
You'll never get in.
You're vampires.
Security's gonna be tight and they only invited assholes.
You don't know us, sweetheart.
We can be assholes.
I want to go.
I want to say good-bye to my girl.
But there's gonna be alcohol and vampires at Sookie's.
Know how you're always saying that eyes are the windows to the soul?
Lettie Mae, please.
Look into mine.
I ain't going to that party looking for no vamper blood.
I just want to say good-bye 'cause there won't be no grave in no cemetery where I can visit my Tara.
Ain't nothing left of her to bury.
I'm so sorry, sweetheart, but no.
No, no, I have to do what's best for you whether you like it or not.
Now, look, let me take care of you tonight.
Please.
All right?
All right.
Now, come on, give me a taste, 'cause I wanna make this just how you like it.
Come on.
Needs cumin.
Okay, all right, I'll...

Well, ladies, we dodged a bullet!
- Yeah, we did.
- Whoo!
Amazing what a little shut-eye can do to calm the nerves.
- You know what, girls?
- Hmm?
After what we all went through,
I'm gonna make some major changes in my life,
- clean up my act.
- That is great, Jane.
I'm gonna finally get my shit together.
- Good for you, girl.
- Amen.
Yeah.
Starting tomorrow.
I'm starting tomorrow, too, okay?
- To not dyin'.
- Amen.
If anyone knows how to live it up, it's you, Jane Bodehouse.
Minus.
Mr. Compton.
I ain't seen you since your daddy died.
It's good to see you, Minus.
What's going on?
Why's everyone goin'--
What's going on, William Compton... is that Lincoln has called his soldiers.
Called his soldiers?
Charles, are you saying--
That's right, William, war.
Everyone's going to enlist.
Based on our education and you and me being from prominent families, we're all but guaranteed to be made commissioned officers.
Isn't that thrilling'?
It is our God-given right to live our lives as we see fit,
- without interference.
- Yeah!
And I, for one, am willing to do whatever it takes to lay down my life if necessary to preserve that God-given right.
Are we gonna let a bunch of Yankee cowards come on down here and take our freedoms?
- Huh?
- No!
Then it is the sovereign right of the state of Louisiana to secede from the union.
Mr. DuPont's right.
Fort Sumter was just the beginning.
Yeah!
You see, we cannot, we must not let them destroy our way of life.
We have no choice but to fight.
Yeah!
With what?
This is a lost cause.
The Yankees have better artillery.
More sophisticated weaponry than we do.
What they will destroy is our town, scorch our land, our livelihoods.
Get outta my bar, William Compton.
We got no room here for Yankee sympathizers.
I'm sorry if you find the truth offensive, Mr. Bodehouse.
Get out!
Go ahead!
To not dyin'.
Hey, Sook.
You look real pretty.
Thanks, so do you.
Yeah, yeah, I have to admit finally getting a chance to shower up makes all the difference.
I was talking to Violet.
Oh.
Tsk.
Oh, Sookie, my sister.
Oh, I know we're not supposed to say we're sorry for your loss, but I am so very sorry.
I've had about a hundred boyfriends die on me over the years, but I remember how painful those first ones were.
There you are, Sookie.
You look like you could do with something eat.
I hear there are two kinds of chicken to try.
Excuse us.
What?
"I've had about a hundred boyfriends die on me, but I--"
Shut up and come dance with me.
♪ Don't be afraid, I'll show you tonight... ♪
Alcide could be an arrogant little shit, even when he was a kid.
You'd tell him to go left and he'd go right just to piss you off.
He'd question everything.
Now, fightin', it's a way of life where we come from, but Alcide, he wouldn't fight just for the sake of fighting'.
In fact, he told me once, "I'll fight when I'm good and ready.
I'll fight when I have something worth fighting for."
You were worth it, Sookie.
Otherwise he wouldn't have fought for you.
My boy died a hero.
But you can't die a hero without having a righteous cause.
Thank you.
To Alcide.
To Alcide.
- To Alcide.
- Alcide.
'Scuse me.
Uh-uh, no, Lettie Mae.
You can't come up in here causing no scene.
- Mm-mm.
- I am so sorry for your loss.
Lettie Mae.
You wanna say a few words about Tara?
First off, I'd like to say my heart goes out to you, Mr. Herveaux.
I'm sad for you, but I'm also glad for you because your son died a hero.
My Tara was a hero, too.
Most of you know I made some big mistakes raising her.
Most of you know I didn't raise her, that's 'cause you did-- her friends.
Still, though, she sacrificed herself trying to save me, even after all the pain I caused her.
And that's just beyond heroic in my book.
So I want to ask you to join me in raising a glass to her.
You got anything non-alcoholic?
Yeah.
Here you go.
Thank you, Deputy.
To my baby girl.
- To Tara.
- To Tara.
Thank you.
How's the party?
You should come inside.
I'm fine.
- Jessica--
- Andy.
I can't.
Did it ever occur to you that you torturing yourself over my girls keeps that pain alive for me, too?
You ever think about that?
This has been a hell of a week we're having, but during it you have been there.
You have been good to Adilyn.
You helped bring Holly back to me and her boys.
I don't know if I'm supposed to be taking some kind of message from all this bullshit that's been going on, but I'm taking one anyhow.
Life's too short.
Jessica, it's too fucking precious to always be looking backwards.
I'm moving forwards.
But I'm gonna need your help to do that.
How can I help?
You got a ring I can borrow?
A ring, but-- oh, my God.
Are you gonna propose to Holly tonight?
Please don't make this a bigger deal than it already is.
But it is a big deal.
I know that!
Jesus Christ, I'm freakin' out inside.
Just give me a ring before I change my mind.
Andy, you can't propose to Holly with any of these.
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
I ain't exactly had time to go to the mall.
Come on.
Wait up!
Are you sure you don't mind me borrowing it, Sookie?
Not at all.
Gran would've loved Holly.
Although she did leave it to Jason to give to the woman he was gonna marry.
That's right, she did.
You're already mine, Jason.
I don't need a ring to tell me that.
Well, here it is.
Oh, my God.
It's beautiful.
That's it?
Holy crap, I'm really gonna do this, huh?
Andy, you got yourself a real good woman, man.
It's all yours.
You seen your mother?
Uh, pretty sure she's in the living room.
Y'all are gonna wanna see this.
Oh, come here.
A little word to the wise.
I don't know if the two of you are fuckin' or not, but if you are, it's gonna have to stop right now.
You got it?
What's up?
Oh, you're bad.
Andy?
Andy, what's wrong?
Could we kill the music, please?
On it.
Andy, oh, my God.
What are you doing?
Holly, I-
- I'm-- I don't know--
I-
- I can't--
I don't know what I'm about to say, but I have been waiting for the perfect moment to do this, but something keeps getting in the way.
It wasn't until you went missing that I realized that something this whole time, was me.
See, I got this voice in my head that says I don't deserve a woman as beautiful as you are.
I don't deserve a woman as kind as you are.
And I probably don't, but...
I know the timing's weird and you got all kinds of healing to do.
- Oh.
- But, please... wear this ring for me?
I'll go through all of it with ya every step of the way.
Yes!
Aw!
I didn't ask you yet.
You gotta let me ask you.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Jumped the gun.
Uh, Holly Cleary, I love you with everything I got.
Will you marry me?
That's lovely, man.
I love you, Andy!
Let's go congratulate 'em.
Yeah.
- Hey.
- What?
What?
- You just seem happy is all.
- Well, I am.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Seriously?
Now?
Yeah, it's been a while since...
I know, but we're at-- we're at a party.
Okay?
Don't be such a wet blanket.
Just try to have fun and we'll leave later, okay?
Oh, man, what a surprise.
You doing okay?
Yeah.
You fixing' to cry?
I think I might be.
Come on, let's sneak upstairs.
Don't get me wrong, I am so happy for Andy and Holly.
It's just a little bit more of a celebration of life than I was ready for.
You miss him?
How can I miss someone I can't even believe is dead?
Alcide dying's a bit of a shock, sweetie.
That's the thing.
It never occurred to me that Alcide could die.
He's just... so-- so big and strong and he just--
It don't matter how big or strong someone is if someone else has a gun.
It was the same way with Terry.
It happened so fast, came out of nowhere.
The thing is, though, when it comes to loving a man and then losing him, it doesn't matter how it happens 'cause he's still gone.
You still have that hole inside you and it hurts just the same no matter how prepared you are for it or not.
When Terry died,
I thought I was gonna die right along with him.
How did you get through it?
At night, when no one was lookin'... sometimes I'd put his jacket on just so I could feel his arms around me again.
You never get over the loss of someone you love.
You just learn to live with it.
And nothing's gonna help heal this pain you're feeling but time.
And tequila.
How about a little tequila?
There's not enough tequila in the world to get me through tonight.
"Wet blanket"?
Do she even know who you is?
She gives me just enough love.
Mm.
And just enough affection to keep me hooked.
That's just like paying the minimum on your credit card bill each month just to keep that fucker from getting cancelled.
That's exactly what it's like.
Mm.
Jesus Christ, am I that fucking simple?
No, sir.
There's nothing simple about you at all.
The night we met, remember that story you told me about how you was turned?
Mm-hmm.
Can I ask a follow-up question?
Of course.
Danny Monoghan.
What about him?
Was y'all...
Yeah.
I told the sales woman my wife and I were going to an exclusive high society event and that only the very best would do.
Voilà.
Oh, my God.
I'm a republi-cunt.
- You think that's funny, huh?
- Mm-hmm.
Wait till you see what that nice man at Neiman's and I picked out for you.
Strip.
Oh, fuck, Eric.
You're stage two.
Just cover the ones that will be visible.
Okay.
I'm gonna die, Pam.
You have to accept that.
Whoo!
- My God, there he is.
- There who is?
That vampire who gave me his blood.
He's been making eyes at me ever since he got here.
- Evening, Arlene.
- Hey, Keith.
Um, Arlene here is super grateful on account of you, you know, saving her life last night and all, but she's been through a lot, so you might wanna,
I don't know, dial down your sexy a notch.
I understand.
And I can wait.
Sookie, would you please tell your friend Arlene here that I think she's the most beautiful woman I've seen in over 300 years?
And I'll see her in her dreams.
Um...
I have to go make tinkle because, you know, I am a human.
Arlene, have you seen James?
Huh?
James-- have you seen him?
I've been looking everywhere.
I think I saw him step outside with Lafayette a little while ago.
Thanks.
You incredible asshole!
- Get out of here.
- I am so sorry.
Really, James?
That's what you have to say?
That you are sorry?
Because need I remind you that I just found you fucking a man in our car.
- Jessica, please.
- Get the fuck out of my way.
Jess, will you please come outside and talk to me?
- Jason?
- Yeah, what's going on?
- Jessica, can we please talk about this?
- There is nothing to say.
Would you please rescind his invitation to this house?
What did he do?
What did you do?
I found him fucking Lafayette in the car that he and I bought together.
Get the fuck outta here, James.
- I should probably--
- Yeah, okay.
Go.
You all right?
Look, I just want to be alone right now.
Okay.
In case you need a place to crash, you know where I live.
You mean, with all that-- that sensitive musician shit, it never occurred to you that he might be gay?
I don't think that he is gay.
I think that he-- he's confused.
Jess, I gotta be honest with you.
Based on what you're telling me you saw him doing outside, it all sounds pretty gay to me.
Oh, my God.
- Who is it?
- It's me.
Go away!
Look, Red, I know this shit got to hurt--
Don't you dare presume to know me.
You do not know the first thing about me.
And you don't know the first thing about him.
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you.
You know what?
When was he turned?
How was he turned?
Who turned him?
And where's he from back before he got turned?
Miss ma'am, you don't know any of this shit, do you?
I do because I cared enough to ask him and he cared enough to tell me.
Now, listen, I--
I know the way this shit went down is real embarrassing.
But if you keep it 100 with yourself and honest, then you know this is not the man for you.
Because he's the man for you?
If he is, what's so fucking unimaginable about that, Red?
Huh?
Everybody else in this fucking town is falling in love and getting engaged and having babies.
Has it ever fucking occurred to you that Lafayette, that queen that make all you white heterosexuals laugh and feel good about yourselves, has it fucking ever occurred to you that maybe I want a piece of happiness, too?
No.
James is a good man.
He's a vampire, Lafayette.
Whatever he is.
If you don't love him, let him go.
And I will take over from here.
I was wrong about that Sookie Stackhouse.
It wasn't her fault all this happened.
Hep-vamps were taking out town after town.
I feel so bad about all the things I said about her.
Her guy gave his life for her.
Lost the man she loved trying to save our town.
So pretty.
I wonder if I'd have the courage to do the same for the woman I love.
She's lost more people than anyone.
Here she is being hostess.
She's got a heart bigger than all of Louisiana.
- Hey, Sookie.
- Hey.
You okay?
I'm drunk.
Oh, okay.
Well, you deserve to be.
Have you seen Arlene?
No, have-- have you seen Bill?
There's a safe house just on the other side of the bridge.
That's good people.
They'll give us food, shelter for the night... get our strength up... so we can keep going north come mornin'.
Shh, get down.
Everybody down.
- Keep going!
- All right, come on.
Shh, shh, shh.
Okay, they're gone.
We're safe.
You scared?
Yeah, I suppose I am.
All right, folks, it's gonna be all right.
We gots to keep moving, though.
- Let's go.
- We've come this far and we're almost--
Well, well, look who we have here.
You had no right to kill that man.
He was a good man.
- You had no goddamn right.
- Oh, actually, I do.
Now, if you would kindly hand over that map.
Do it!
Hey.
Hey!
No!
- No!
No!
- Get out of the way, Caroline!
Please, Charles, I beg of you!
Please think of the children!
You let that man serve as a warning of what we do to any and all deserters, no matter what their color.
Hyah!
Bill?
I'm coming out.
Is it safe?
Yeah, it's safe, Sookie.
You don't look quite right.
Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
I'm just thinkin' is all.
- Well, then, stop.
The whole point of this celebration is so that we don't sit around here with long faces.
You haven't socialized at all tonight.
I know everyone's pleased to see you here.
No, they're pleased to see you, Sookie.
You've done well.
You've done more these last several days than I've managed to achieve in decades.
Mainstream.
- I didn't do this.
- Yeah, you did.
Well...
I've had a lovely evening.
You can't leave yet.
No, I should be on my way.
But I had a wonderful time.
But I must admit this concept of men and women being friends was a little bit foreign in my day.
- Bill?
- Yeah?
Thank you.
For what?
For seeing me the way I can't see myself sometimes.
Come on.
Good night, Bill.
Good night, Sookie.
Look at her smilin' like that, how she lights up the room.
Heard Willa was here.
Can't figure out what my Tara's trying to tell me unless I get me some of Willa's blood.
Don't care if I have to stab her to get it.
Where's Willa?
Hey, where's Willa?
Who the fuck's Willa?
Dance with me.
No.
Willa!
Sugar, I've had a little too much to drink so you're gonna just have to get to the point.
Okay, since Eric released me,
I need a job, so I was wondering if maybe I could be a waitress--
Lettie Mae, stop!
What the fuck?
!
Get back!
Get the fuck back!
- I'm okay, I'm okay.
- She's okay.
She's okay, y'all.
Put your fangs away.
What the hell's goings on here?
Lettie Mae stabbed Willa.
Of course she did.
What the fuck, Auntie?
Tara has been trying to contact me from the other side.
She's stuck, and the only way I can find out what she needs is with Willa's blood.
Come on before you get killed.
Come on, come on.
You're all looking at me like I'm crazy, but it's only because I used to have a drinking problem that people don't believe me!
You stabbed somebody, Auntie!
That's why people think you crazy.
Come on.
You're all fucking crazy, if you ask me.
What the fuck are we doing here, huh?
When just three days ago a group of rabid vampires came and attacked the town and killed a bunch of people and kidnapped us, right?
Arlene, Jane, Holly, and I, we were fucking chained in a dungeon and we--
Let's go to another room and talk about this.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
- Yes.
No, no, Sam.
No!
I know you don't want to hear this, but it needs to be said 'cause it's real.
Damn it, people are dead, people are traumatized, and the reaction you all have to this is to throw a party?
You fucking kidding me?
Now, I ain't for stabbing people, but at least Lettie Mae gets it.
Shit, I mean, you all are going on like this shit's normal and it's not.
This shit doesn't happen in other towns.
- Take me home.
I wanna go home.
- Okay.
- I wanna go home.
- Okay, okay.
- Here's your knife.
- Thanks.
Hey, I'm gonna make sure they get home safe.
Thanks, Violet.
I don't know.
Maybe Lafayette is right.
- What about?
- James and I.
Maybe we don't belong together.
You did meet in a prison camp, Jess.
Careful, Jason.
You know, people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
I see your point.
Yeah, Violet.
She's pretty weird, ain't she?
I mean, she's-- she's ancient and sexy as hell, but she's a little...
- Off?
- Yeah.
She's way the fuck off sometimes.
You think maybe that's why...
No, why what?
We're supposed to be talking about you, Jess.
Yeah, I don't really feel like thinking about me anymore.
Go on, what?
Well, okay, then.
It was like earlier tonight when we were digging in trying to find Gran's ring to give it to Andy,
Violet was like, "I don't need a ring to prove to the world that you are mine."
All I kept thinking was, "Jesus, please.
Sweet baby Jesus, put that ring on Holly's finger before it winds up on Violet's."
I mean, that was my Gran's ring, Jess.
It meant a lot that she wanted to give that to me.
Hell, man, I would love to have put it on someone one day.
But if that someone had to be Violet...
I don't know.
- Oh, Jason.
- What?
I think you might just be the sweetest man in the world.
Of all the horrible things I've seen in the last 100 years, this could be the most disturbing.
Yeah.
Oh, come on.
It's fun because we're together.
No, it isn't.
What do Mommy and Daddy look like again?
Ah.
Someone's having a good time.
You think Daddy'd be enjoying himself this much if Sarah got to him first?
I'll get him alone.
You mingle, find the mother.
How?
All these bitches look the same.
Mommy?
Oh, my God.
Hi, Mommy.
Sarah, what in he--
The whole world is looking for you.
What are you doing here?
Have you lost your ever-lovin' mind?
Oh, my God.
I missed you so much.
You look so pretty in that suit.
I forgot how beautiful you were.
What do you want?
And what have you done to your hair?
I'm in trouble.
Well, no shit, baby girl.
No, I mean real trouble.
And I need help from someone high up.
Someone powerful, right here, right now.
Is Laura Bush out there?
No, she is not.
Well, can you call her?
Sarah, Laura stopped taking my calls just about the time that that book came out claiming that my daughter is the monster who created the monsters who are scaring the shit out of half the country.
Now, is that true?
Yes.
But I'm not a monster.
I'm a Buddhist.
What?
Look, you have got to get out of here.
If the liberal media finds out that you are at this event, they are never gonna let you be--
No, Mommy, stop.
Listen very closely.
The Yakuza are after me.
Oh, darlin'.
Paul?
I need to ask you some questions about your daughter.
Has she come to see you?
- The Yakuza?
- Uh-huh.
Go, move!
Get out!
- Where is your daughter?
- I don't know!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
- Come on!
- Go on, baby!
What are you doing out here, my love?
Someday soon you'll be buried here, too.
I don't want to fight.
But I don't see a way out.
- Do you?
- No.
I have loved you since the very first time I ever saw you.
Long back as I can remember.
You are my first and only true love.
And you are mine.
I will survive this war, Caroline.
And when it's all over, I will come back to you... and to the children.
I promise you.

( Ginger gasping )
I don't give a shit!
I am not going with you.
I would rather die than get in that coffin!
You will do what your maker tells you to do.
He may be my maker, but he sure as fuck didn't raise me.
Tara did.
She was the one who taught me how to feed, how to control my impulses.
He left, and then you left her when we needed you most.
We have bigger fucking problems than your mommy and your daddy--
- She died because of you!
- I am sorry--
Enough!
( sighs )
You're right.
I've been a terrible maker to you.
And for that I am truly sorry.
But I do not regret turning you, and I'm proud to call you my progeny.
Why did you come back for me?
Pam and I are gonna kill Sarah Newlin before I meet the true death.
You can count me out.
She was practically your stepmother, Willa.
If you have any idea where she might be,
I need to know it.
- I'm not going with you.
- Like fuck you aren't.
But I will tell you what I know if you release me.
Willa Burrell,
I renounce the ties of our blood and my dominion over you as my progeny.
As your maker...
- I release you.
- ( gasps )
Like being kicked in the cooch by a wallaby, isn't it?
Sarah has a sister.
Oh, no shit, Willa.
The whole world knows that.
- You'd better know more.
- Her name is Amber.
Amber Mills.
And she's a vampire.
Oh.
How the fuck could Sarah Newlin have a vampire sister and the world not know about it?
I don't know, but I overheard her one night on the phone at the governor's mansion.
Sarah was warning her never to call there again or my father would send her to camp.
Any idea where this Amber lives?
The call came from a Dallas area code.
Good girl.
- Ginger?
- ( gasps )
Tell the driver we're heading for Dallas.
And we'll only be needing two travel coffins.
What?
No!
You just got back.
And if you walk out that door,
I ain't never gonna see you again, am I?
Take me with you.
Put me in the third coffin.
- Sorry.
- What-- you're sorry?
I have been your sex slave for 15 years, Eric Northman, and we ain't never had sex.
Blow job, hand job, nothing.
Do you know what a sex slave is without the sex?
A slave?
Now, you are taking me with you to Dallas.
And if you can't fucking take me, then you had better fuckin' fuck me before you go.
Ginger, I'm diseased.
So the fuck am I!

No!

Sook?
Hey.
Hey.
I came as soon as I heard.
Ab-- about Alcide?
About everything.
How is you holding up?
( voice breaking ) The house is so empty.
Well, that big man of yours did take up a lot of space.
- Sorry.
- No, I'm sorry, Sook.
I gotta clean up.
- Jackson will be here in the morning.
- No, don't worry about that.
- We'll take care of this.
- No, what you need is some sleep.
When's the last time you got some serious shut-eye?
Come on, let me put you to bed.
Lafayette?
Yes, ma'am?
Don't leave.
Sook, I will be here when you wake up.
So don't fret, 'kay?
Night-night.
( distant clanking )
( thuds )
( objects clattering )
What the hell?
( door opens, closes )
Look who's up.
- Where's all his--
- In the truck.
When Alcide's mama died, the hardest part was going through all her things.
You just say when you wanna go through it all, when you feel you're ready, and Jenny and me will have you out to the place and we'll figure it all out.
Yeah, we'll figure it out.
- ( laughter )
- Hey!
The undead has arisen.
- Hey, there, Sookie.
- How'd you sleep?
Lafayette, you wanna tell me why there's enough food to choke a horse on my dining room table?
Child, me and Jenny was bustin' our humps cooking' all the livelong day.
Well, that's-- that's real sweet, but I can't eat all this.
There's enough food here to feed the whole town off of.
Well... the whole town will be here.
( laughs )
- What?
- Uh-huh.
Wait, are-- are y'all throwing a party?
- All:
Yeah!
- Sookie, come on.
In my house?
The day after--
I know what you're probably thinking, honey.
But death doesn't have to be such a sad thing.
Actually, it does.
Death is inherently sad.
I'm sad.
I'm not in the mood for a party.
Sook.
Sook!
Sook, what did you say last night when you came home?
About how this house was feeling so empty?
That's why we're gonna fill it up, so we can say "fuck you," to death and "hello," to life.
- Jenny:
Yeah.
- And that's what we're doing.
We are motherfucking celebrating life.
I'm going back to sleep.
What would Tara want?
What would Alcide want?
Alcide would want people to be around you tonight, Sookie.
Yes, ma'am, so take that pretty little ass of yours upstairs and get presentable.
'Cause folk gonna be here soon with some top-shelf alcohol, and I got one restriction-- not a nan person come up to you and say, "Oh, I'm sorry for your loss."
Mm-mm, none of that bullshit.
- Hear, hear, I say.
- James:
That's right.
Come on, hooker.
Let's bring out the rest of the vittles and bits.
James:
And that chicken Jenny made.
- Lafayette:
It ain't as good as mine.
- ( knock on door )
Bill:
Sookie?
Ugh, this is not happening.
- Am I early?
- Why, do I not look ready?
You know what, actually, best not answer that.
I only just now found out about the party I'm hosting tonight.
I see.
Um...
I didn't have any alcohol on hand, as requested.
My mother always taught me it was ungentlemanly to turn up to a gathering empty-handed, so, uh, I brought you these.
Well, I guess I'd better go upstairs and put my face on, but in the meantime, I invite you in.
( rings doorbell )
Amber Mills?
Who are you?
I was always the black sheep of the family.
Started fangbanging right outta high school while Little Miss Perfect's marrying Steven Newlin.
- ( doors closing )
- She's not here.
Just like I told you she wasn't.
We had to be sure.
Your boyfriend?
Jeremy.
He was the one that turned me.
He helped me get my shit together.
But the second I turn, Sarah freaks.
She's married into the Fellowship of the Sun, after all.
But she knows I'm broke, so she starts paying me off, a monthly cash delivery to stay in the coffin.
Then she goes out and she tells the world that her sister was taken from her by those evil vampires, that I disappeared into thin air.
But I was here the whole time.
Jeremy and me sittin' around watching "House Hunters" marathons and drinkin' Tru Blood.
What happened to Jeremy?
Same thing that's happening to us.
One day, he gets the veins.
A few months later, he's dying in my arms.
Sometimes I beat myself up over it.
I mean, if I hadn't taken her money, if I had come out instead of hiding--
She would've had you killed and kept on walking.
None of this is your fault.
It's your sister's, which is why Pam and I are going after her.
And will you help us find her?
Are you gonna kill her?
There's a real good chance that's the way it's gonna go down.
Then you can count me in.
Mm.
I like her.
I like you.
Is it all right if I haven't made up my mind about you yet?
Yeah, I really like her.
When's the last time you saw Sarah?
Oh, it's been years now.
But she did call here this morning.
She said she just got to Dallas and she needed a place to hide.
I told her to fuck off.
She's in Dallas.
Any idea where else she might've gone?
Where she always goes, to Mommy and Daddy.
Even though she disgraced the family, they always fall for her BS.
And where do Mommy and Daddy live?
Why, Preston Hollow, of course.
But they won't be home tonight.
Probably already left for this.
The second I told her that's where Mommy and Daddy were going, she hung up.
She'll be there.
Looks like we're going to a gala.
Do you have a picture of your parents I can borrow?
You'll never get in.
You're vampires.
Security's gonna be tight and they only invited assholes.
You don't know us, sweetheart.
We can be assholes.
I want to go.
I want to say good-bye to my girl.
But there's gonna be alcohol and vampires at Sookie's.
Know how you're always saying that eyes are the windows to the soul?
Lettie Mae, please.
Look into mine.
I ain't going to that party looking for no vamper blood.
I just want to say good-bye 'cause there won't be no grave in no cemetery where I can visit my Tara.
Ain't nothing left of her to bury.
I'm so sorry, sweetheart, but no.
No, no, I have to do what's best for you whether you like it or not.
Now, look, let me take care of you tonight.
Please.
All right?
All right.
Now, come on, give me a taste, 'cause I wanna make this just how you like it.
- Come on.
- ( blows )
Needs cumin.

Amazing what a little shut-eye can do to calm the nerves.
- Jane:
You know what, girls?
- Hmm?
After what we all went through,
I'm gonna make some major changes in my life,
- clean up my act.
- That is great, Jane.
I'm gonna finally get my shit together.
- Good for you, girl.
- Holly:
Amen.
Yeah.
- Starting tomorrow.
- ( all laughing )
I'm starting tomorrow, too, okay?
( laughing )
- To not dyin'.
- Amen.
Arlene:
If anyone knows how to live it up, it's you, Jane Bodehouse.
( horse neighs )
Minus.
Mr. Compton.
I ain't seen you since your daddy died.
It's good to see you, Minus.
What's going on?
Why's everyone goin'--
What's going on, William Compton... ( snaps ) is that Lincoln has called his soldiers.
Called his soldiers?
Charles, are you saying--
That's right, William, war.
Everyone's going to enlist.
Based on our education and you and me being from prominent families, we're all but guaranteed to be made commissioned officers.
Isn't that thrilling'?
( laughs )
( men shouting )
It is our God-given right to live our lives as we see fit,
- without interference.
- Crowd:
Yeah!
Charles:
And I, for one, am willing to do whatever it takes to lay down my life if necessary to preserve that God-given right.
Are we gonna let a bunch of Yankee cowards come on down here and take our freedoms?
- Huh?
- Crowd:
No!
Then it is the sovereign right of the state of Louisiana to secede from the union.
( crowd cheers )
Mr. DuPont's right.
Fort Sumter was just the beginning.
Crowd:
Yeah!
You see, we cannot, we must not let them destroy our way of life.
We have no choice but to fight.
Crowd:
Yeah!
With what?
( crowd murmuring )
This is a lost cause.
The Yankees have better artillery.
More sophisticated weaponry than we do.
What they will destroy is our town, scorch our land, our livelihoods.
Get outta my bar, William Compton.
We got no room here for Yankee sympathizers.
I'm sorry if you find the truth offensive, Mr. Bodehouse.
- Man:
Get out!
Go ahead!
- ( men shouting )
- ( music playing ) - ( partygoers laughing )
Holly:
To not dyin'.
Hey, Sook.
You look real pretty.
Thanks, so do you.
Yeah, yeah, I have to admit finally getting a chance to shower up makes all the difference.
I was talking to Violet.
Oh.
Tsk.
Oh, Sookie, my sister.
Oh, I know we're not supposed to say we're sorry for your loss, but I am so very sorry.
I've had about a hundred boyfriends die on me over the years, but I remember how painful those first ones were.
There you are, Sookie.
You look like you could do with something eat.
I hear there are two kinds of chicken to try.
Excuse us.
What?
"I've had about a hundred boyfriends die on me, but I--"
Shut up and come dance with me.
♪ Don't be afraid, I'll show you tonight... ♪
( TV playing in background )
( snoring softly )
Alcide could be an arrogant little shit, even when he was a kid.
You'd tell him to go left and he'd go right just to piss you off.
He'd question everything.
Now, fightin', it's a way of life where we come from, but Alcide, he wouldn't fight just for the sake of fighting'.
In fact, he told me once, "I'll fight when I'm good and ready.
I'll fight when I have something worth fighting for."
You were worth it, Sookie.
Otherwise he wouldn't have fought for you.
My boy died a hero.
But you can't die a hero without having a righteous cause.
Thank you.
To Alcide.
Others:
To Alcide.
- To Alcide.
- Alcide.
Lettie Mae:
'Scuse me.
Uh-uh, no, Lettie Mae.
You can't come up in here causing no scene.
- Mm-mm.
- I am so sorry for your loss.
Lettie Mae.
You wanna say a few words about Tara?
( heavy sigh )
First off, I'd like to say my heart goes out to you, Mr. Herveaux.
I'm sad for you, but I'm also glad for you because your son died a hero.
My Tara was a hero, too.
Most of you know I made some big mistakes raising her.
Most of you know I didn't raise her, that's 'cause you did-- her friends.
Still, though, she sacrificed herself trying to save me, even after all the pain I caused her.
And that's just beyond heroic in my book.
So I want to ask you to join me in raising a glass to her.
You got anything non-alcoholic?
Yeah.
Here you go.
Thank you, Deputy.
To my baby girl.
- To Tara.
- Others:
To Tara.
( mouths ) Thank you.
How's the party?
You should come inside.
I'm fine.
- Jessica--
- Andy.
I can't.
Did it ever occur to you that you torturing yourself over my girls keeps that pain alive for me, too?
You ever think about that?
This has been a hell of a week we're having, but during it you have been there.
You have been good to Adilyn.
You helped bring Holly back to me and her boys.
I don't know if I'm supposed to be taking some kind of message from all this bullshit that's been going on, but I'm taking one anyhow.
Life's too short.
Jessica, it's too fucking precious to always be looking backwards.
I'm moving forwards.
But I'm gonna need your help to do that.
How can I help?
( takes deep breath )
You got a ring I can borrow?
A ring, but-- oh, my God.
Are you gonna propose to Holly tonight?
Please don't make this a bigger deal than it already is.
But it is a big deal.
I know that!
Jesus Christ, I'm freakin' out inside.
Just give me a ring before I change my mind.
Andy, you can't propose to Holly with any of these.
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
I ain't exactly had time to go to the mall.
Come on.
Wait up!
Are you sure you don't mind me borrowing it, Sookie?
Not at all.
Gran would've loved Holly.
Although she did leave it to Jason to give to the woman he was gonna marry.
That's right, she did.
You're already mine, Jason.
I don't need a ring to tell me that.
Well, here it is.
Jessica:
Oh, my God.
It's beautiful.
That's it?
Holy crap, I'm really gonna do this, huh?
( Jessica laughs )
Andy, you got yourself a real good woman, man.
It's all yours.
( music playing )
You seen your mother?
Uh, pretty sure she's in the living room.
Y'all are gonna wanna see this.
Oh, come here.
A little word to the wise.
I don't know if the two of you are fuckin' or not, but if you are, it's gonna have to stop right now.
You got it?
What's up?
( laughing )
( Holly laughing )
Oh, you're bad.
Andy?
Andy, what's wrong?
Could we kill the music, please?
- On it.
- ( music stops )
Andy, oh, my God.
What are you doing?
Holly, I-
- I'm-- I don't know--
I-
- I can't-- ( sighs )
I don't know what I'm about to say, but I have been waiting for the perfect moment to do this, but something keeps getting in the way.
It wasn't until you went missing that I realized that something this whole time, was me.
See, I got this voice in my head that says I don't deserve a woman as beautiful as you are.
I don't deserve a woman as kind as you are.
And I probably don't, but...
I know the timing's weird and you got all kinds of healing to do.
- Oh.
- But, please... wear this ring for me?
I'll go through all of it with ya every step of the way.
Yes!
Crowd:
Aw!
I didn't ask you yet.
You gotta let me ask you.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- Sorry.
- ( laughter )
Jumped the gun.
Uh, Holly Cleary, I love you with everything I got.
Will you marry me?
( applause, cheering )
- ( ululating ) - ( cheering )
Jason:
That's lovely, man.
I love you, Andy!
Let's go congratulate 'em.
Yeah.
- Hey.
- What?
What?
- You just seem happy is all.
- Well, I am.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Seriously?
Now?
Yeah, it's been a while since...
I know, but we're at-- we're at a party.
Okay?
Don't be such a wet blanket.
Just try to have fun and we'll leave later, okay?
Oh, man, what a surprise.
You doing okay?
Yeah.
You fixing' to cry?
I think I might be.
Come on, let's sneak upstairs.
Don't get me wrong, I am so happy for Andy and Holly.
It's just a little bit more of a celebration of life than I was ready for.
You miss him?
How can I miss someone I can't even believe is dead?
Arlene:
Alcide dying's a bit of a shock, sweetie.
Sookie:
That's the thing.
It never occurred to me that Alcide could die.
He's just... so-- so big and strong and he just--
It don't matter how big or strong someone is if someone else has a gun.
It was the same way with Terry.
It happened so fast, came out of nowhere.
The thing is, though, when it comes to loving a man and then losing him, it doesn't matter how it happens 'cause he's still gone.
You still have that hole inside you and it hurts just the same no matter how prepared you are for it or not.
( sighs ) When Terry died,
I thought I was gonna die right along with him.
How did you get through it?
At night, when no one was lookin'... sometimes I'd put his jacket on just so I could feel his arms around me again.
( laughs )
You never get over the loss of someone you love.
You just learn to live with it.
And nothing's gonna help heal this pain you're feeling but time.
And tequila.
( both laughing )
How about a little tequila?
Sookie:
There's not enough tequila in the world to get me through tonight.
"Wet blanket"?
Do she even know who you is?
She gives me just enough love.
Mm.
And just enough affection to keep me hooked.
That's just like paying the minimum on your credit card bill each month just to keep that fucker from getting cancelled.
That's exactly what it's like.
Mm.
Jesus Christ, am I that fucking simple?
No, sir.
There's nothing simple about you at all.
The night we met, remember that story you told me about how you was turned?
Mm-hmm.
Can I ask a follow-up question?
Of course.
Danny Monoghan.
What about him?
Was y'all...
Yeah.
I told the sales woman my wife and I were going to an exclusive high society event and that only the very best would do.
Voilà.
Pam:
Oh, my God.
I'm a republi-cunt.
( laughs )
- You think that's funny, huh?
- Mm-hmm.
Wait till you see what that nice man at Neiman's and I picked out for you.
Strip.
Oh, fuck, Eric.
You're stage two.
Just cover the ones that will be visible.
Okay.
I'm gonna die, Pam.
You have to accept that.
( sniffles )
- ( music playing ) - ( whooping )
Whoo!
( gasps )
- My God, there he is.
- There who is?
That vampire who gave me his blood.
He's been making eyes at me ever since he got here.
- Evening, Arlene.
- ( Sookie laughs ) Hey, Keith.
Um, Arlene here is super grateful on account of you, you know, saving her life last night and all, but she's been through a lot, so you might wanna,
I don't know, dial down your sexy a notch.
( laughs )
I understand.
And I can wait.
Sookie, would you please tell your friend Arlene here that I think she's the most beautiful woman I've seen in over 300 years?
( whispers ) And I'll see her in her dreams.
Um...
I have to go make tinkle because, you know, I am a human.
Arlene, have you seen James?
Huh?
James-- have you seen him?
I've been looking everywhere.
I think I saw him step outside with Lafayette a little while ago.
Thanks.
( moaning, panting )
You incredible asshole!
- Get out of here.
- I am so sorry.
Really, James?
That's what you have to say?
That you are sorry?
Because need I remind you that I just found you fucking a man in our car.
- Jessica, please.
- Get the fuck out of my way.
Jess, will you please come outside and talk to me?
- Jason?
- Yeah, what's going on?
- Jessica, can we please talk about this?
- There is nothing to say.
Would you please rescind his invitation to this house?
What did he do?
What did you do?
I found him fucking Lafayette in the car that he and I bought together.
Get the fuck outta here, James.
( door slams )
- I should probably--
- Yeah, okay.
Go.
You all right?
Look, I just want to be alone right now.
Okay.
In case you need a place to crash, you know where I live.
( sighs )
You mean, with all that-- that sensitive musician shit, it never occurred to you that he might be gay?
I don't think that he is gay.
I think that he-- he's confused.
Jess, I gotta be honest with you.
Based on what you're telling me you saw him doing outside, it all sounds pretty gay to me.
- Oh, my God.
- ( knock on door )
- Who is it?
- Lafayette:
It's me.
Go away!
Look, Red, I know this shit got to hurt--
Don't you dare presume to know me.
You do not know the first thing about me.
And you don't know the first thing about him.
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you.
You know what?
When was he turned?
How was he turned?
Who turned him?
And where's he from back before he got turned?
Miss ma'am, you don't know any of this shit, do you?
I do because I cared enough to ask him and he cared enough to tell me.
Now, listen, I--
I know the way this shit went down is real embarrassing.
But if you keep it 100 with yourself and honest, then you know this is not the man for you.
Because he's the man for you?
If he is, what's so fucking unimaginable about that, Red?
Huh?
Everybody else in this fucking town is falling in love and getting engaged and having babies.
Has it ever fucking occurred to you that Lafayette, that queen that make all you white heterosexuals laugh and feel good about yourselves, has it fucking ever occurred to you that maybe I want a piece of happiness, too?
No.
( sighs )
James is a good man.
He's a vampire, Lafayette.
Whatever he is.
If you don't love him, let him go.
And I will take over from here.
- ( overlapping thoughts )
- I was wrong about that Sookie Stackhouse.
It wasn't her fault all this happened.
Hep-vamps were taking out town after town.
I feel so bad about all the things I said about her.
Her guy gave his life for her.
Lost the man she loved trying to save our town.
So pretty.
I wonder if I'd have the courage to do the same for the woman I love.
She's lost more people than anyone.
Here she is being hostess.
She's got a heart bigger than all of Louisiana.
- Willa:
Hey, Sookie.
- Hey.
You okay?
I'm drunk.
Oh, okay.
Well, you deserve to be.
Have you seen Arlene?
No, have-- have you seen Bill?
There's a safe house just on the other side of the bridge.
That's good people.
They'll give us food, shelter for the night... get our strength up... so we can keep going north come mornin'.
( horse neighs )
Shh, get down.
Everybody down.
- Man:
Keep going!
- Man #2:
All right, come on.
( baby crying )
- Shh, shh, shh.
- ( crying continues )
Okay, they're gone.
We're safe.
You scared?
Yeah, I suppose I am.
All right, folks, it's gonna be all right.
We gots to keep moving, though.
- Man:
Let's go.
- We've come this far and we're almost- ( gunshot ) - ( horses neigh )
( baby crying )
Well, well, look who we have here.
You had no right to kill that man.
He was a good man.
- You had no goddamn right.
- Oh, actually, I do.
Now, if you would kindly hand over that map.
Do it!
( baby continues crying )
Hey.
Hey!
- ( hammer clicks )
- No!
- No!
No!
- Get out of the way, Caroline!
Please, Charles, I beg of you!
Please think of the children!
( groans )
- ( yells ) - ( rifle fires )
You let that man serve as a warning of what we do to any and all deserters, no matter what their color.
Hyah!
( continues crying )
Bill?
I'm coming out.
Is it safe?
Yeah, it's safe, Sookie.
You don't look quite right.
Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
I'm just thinkin' is all.
- Well, then, stop.
The whole point of this celebration is so that we don't sit around here with long faces.
( chuckles )
You haven't socialized at all tonight.
I know everyone's pleased to see you here.
No, they're pleased to see you, Sookie.
You've done well.
You've done more these last several days than I've managed to achieve in decades.
Mainstream.
- ( music playing ) - ( chatter )
- I didn't do this.
- Yeah, you did.
Well...
I've had a lovely evening.
You can't leave yet.
No, I should be on my way.
But I had a wonderful time.
But I must admit this concept of men and women being friends was a little bit foreign in my day.
- Bill?
- Yeah?
Thank you.
For what?
For seeing me the way I can't see myself sometimes.
Come on.
Good night, Bill.
Good night, Sookie.
Woman thinking:
Look at her smilin' like that, how she lights up the room.
Lettie Mae thinking:
Heard Willa was here.
Can't figure out what my Tara's trying to tell me unless I get me some of Willa's blood.
Don't care if I have to stab her to get it.
Where's Willa?
Hey, where's Willa?
Who the fuck's Willa?
Dance with me.
No.
Willa!
( slurred ) Sugar, I've had a little too much to drink so you're gonna just have to get to the point.
Willa:
Okay, since Eric released me,
I need a job, so I was wondering if maybe I could be a waitress--
Lettie Mae, stop!
- ( screams )
- What the fuck?
!
( grunts )
- ( vampires hiss ) - ( screams )
Get back!
Get the fuck back!
- I'm okay, I'm okay.
- Sam:
She's okay.
She's okay, y'all.
Put your fangs away.
Lafayette:
What the hell's goings on here?
Lettie Mae stabbed Willa.
Of course she did.
What the fuck, Auntie?
Tara has been trying to contact me from the other side.
She's stuck, and the only way I can find out what she needs is with Willa's blood.
Come on before you get killed.
Come on, come on.
You're all looking at me like I'm crazy, but it's only because I used to have a drinking problem that people don't believe me!
You stabbed somebody, Auntie!
That's why people think you crazy.
Come on.
You're all fucking crazy, if you ask me.
What the fuck are we doing here, huh?
When just three days ago a group of rabid vampires came and attacked the town and killed a bunch of people and kidnapped us, right?
Arlene, Jane, Holly, and I, we were fucking chained in a dungeon and we--
( quietly ) Let's go to another room and talk about this.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
- Yes.
No, no, Sam.
No!
I know you don't want to hear this, but it needs to be said 'cause it's real.
Damn it, people are dead, people are traumatized, and the reaction you all have to this is to throw a party?
You fucking kidding me?
Now, I ain't for stabbing people, but at least Lettie Mae gets it.
Shit, I mean, you all are going on like this shit's normal and it's not.
This shit doesn't happen in other towns.
- Take me home.
I wanna go home.
- Okay.
- I wanna go home.
- Okay, okay.
- Here's your knife.
- Thanks.
Hey, I'm gonna make sure they get home safe.
Thanks, Violet.
I don't know.
Maybe Lafayette is right.
- What about?
- James and I.
Maybe we don't belong together.
You did meet in a prison camp, Jess.
Careful, Jason.
You know, people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
I see your point.
Yeah, Violet.
She's pretty weird, ain't she?
I mean, she's-- she's ancient and sexy as hell, but she's a little...
- Off?
- Yeah. ( chuckles )
She's way the fuck off sometimes.
You think maybe that's why...
No, why what?
We're supposed to be talking about you, Jess.
Yeah, I don't really feel like thinking about me anymore.
Go on, what?
Well, okay, then.
It was like earlier tonight when we were digging in trying to find Gran's ring to give it to Andy,
Violet was like, "I don't need a ring to prove to the world that you are mine."
( chuckles )
All I kept thinking was, "Jesus, please.
Sweet baby Jesus, put that ring on Holly's finger before it winds up on Violet's."
I mean, that was my Gran's ring, Jess.
It meant a lot that she wanted to give that to me.
Hell, man, I would love to have put it on someone one day.
But if that someone had to be Violet...
I don't know.
- Oh, Jason.
- What?
I think you might just be the sweetest man in the world.
( gasps )
( music playing )
Pam:
Of all the horrible things I've seen in the last 100 years, this could be the most disturbing.
Yeah.
Oh, come on.
It's fun because we're together.
No, it isn't.
What do Mommy and Daddy look like again?
Ah.
( laughs )
Pam:
Someone's having a good time.
You think Daddy'd be enjoying himself this much if Sarah got to him first?
I'll get him alone.
You mingle, find the mother.
How?
All these bitches look the same.
( chuckles )
- Mommy?
- ( gasps )
Oh, my God.
Hi, Mommy.
Sarah, what in he--
The whole world is looking for you.
What are you doing here?
Have you lost your ever-lovin' mind?
Oh, my God.
I missed you so much.
You look so pretty in that suit.
I forgot how beautiful you were.
What do you want?
And what have you done to your hair?
I'm in trouble.
Well, no shit, baby girl.
No, I mean real trouble.
And I need help from someone high up.
Someone powerful, right here, right now.
Is Laura Bush out there?
No, she is not.
Well, can you call her?
Sarah, Laura stopped taking my calls just about the time that that book came out claiming that my daughter is the monster who created the monsters who are scaring the shit out of half the country.
Now, is that true?
Yes.
But I'm not a monster.
I'm a Buddhist.
What?
Look, you have got to get out of here.
If the liberal media finds out that you are at this event, they are never gonna let you be--
No, Mommy, stop.
Listen very closely.
The Yakuza are after me.
Oh, darlin'.
( panting )
( moaning )
( panting, moaning continue )
( chatter )
Paul?
I need to ask you some questions about your daughter.
Has she come to see you?
( screams )
( crowd screaming )
( gunshots )
( both scream )
- The Yakuza?
- Uh-huh.
- Go, move!
Get out!
- ( screaming, shouting )
- Where is your daughter?
- I don't know!
- ( panting ) - ( automatic gunfire )
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
( panting )
- Come on!
- Go on, baby!
( screams )
( gasps )
( choking )
( grunting )
( inhales )
What are you doing out here, my love?
Someday soon you'll be buried here, too.
I don't want to fight.
But I don't see a way out.
- Do you?
- No.
I have loved you since the very first time I ever saw you.
( chuckles )
Long back as I can remember.
You are my first and only true love.
And you are mine.
I will survive this war, Caroline.
And when it's all over, I will come back to you... and to the children.
I promise you.

I don't give a shit!
I am not going with you.
I would rather die than get in that coffin!
You will do what your maker tells you to do.
He may be my maker, but he sure as fuck didn't raise me.
Tara did.
She was the one who taught me how to feed, how to control my impulses.
He left, and then you left her when we needed you most.
We have bigger fucking problems than your mommy and your daddy--
- She died because of you!
- I am sorry--
Enough!
You're right.
I've been a terrible maker to you.
And for that I am truly sorry.
But I do not regret turning you, and I'm proud to call you my progeny.
Why did you come back for me?
Pam and I are gonna kill Sarah Newlin before I meet the true death.
You can count me out.
She was practically your stepmother, Willa.
If you have any idea where she might be,
I need to know it.
- I'm not going with you.
- Like fuck you aren't.
But I will tell you what I know if you release me.
Willa Burrell,
I renounce the ties of our blood and my dominion over you as my progeny.
As your maker...
I release you.
Like being kicked in the cooch by a wallaby, isn't it?
Sarah has a sister.
Oh, no shit, Willa.
The whole world knows that.
- You'd better know more.
- Her name is Amber.
Amber Mills.
And she's a vampire.
Oh.
How the fuck could Sarah Newlin have a vampire sister and the world not know about it?
I don't know, but I overheard her one night on the phone at the governor's mansion.
Sarah was warning her never to call there again or my father would send her to camp.
Any idea where this Amber lives?
The call came from a Dallas area code.
Good girl.
Ginger?
Tell the driver we're heading for Dallas.
And we'll only be needing two travel coffins.
What?
No!
You just got back.
And if you walk out that door,
I ain't never gonna see you again, am I?
Take me with you.
Put me in the third coffin.
- Sorry.
- What-- you're sorry?
I have been your sex slave for 15 years, Eric Northman, and we ain't never had sex.
Blow job, hand job, nothing.
Do you know what a sex slave is without the sex?
A slave?
Now, you are taking me with you to Dallas.
And if you can't fucking take me, then you had better fuckin' fuck me before you go.
Ginger, I'm diseased.
So the fuck am I!
No!

Sook?
Hey.
Hey.
I came as soon as I heard.
Ab-- about Alcide?
About everything.
How is you holding up?
The house is so empty.
Well, that big man of yours did take up a lot of space.
- Sorry.
- No, I'm sorry, Sook.
I gotta clean up.
- Jackson will be here in the morning.
- No, don't worry about that.
- We'll take care of this.
- No, what you need is some sleep.
When's the last time you got some serious shut-eye?
Come on, let me put you to bed.
Lafayette?
Yes, ma'am?
Don't leave.
Sook, I will be here when you wake up.
So don't fret, 'kay?
Night-night.
What the hell?
Look who's up.
- Where's all his--
- In the truck.
When Alcide's mama died, the hardest part was going through all her things.
You just say when you wanna go through it all, when you feel you're ready, and Jenny and me will have you out to the place and we'll figure it all out.
Yeah, we'll figure it out.
Hey!
The undead has arisen.
- Hey, there, Sookie.
- How'd you sleep?
Lafayette, you wanna tell me why there's enough food to choke a horse on my dining room table?
Child, me and Jenny was bustin' our humps cooking' all the livelong day.
Well, that's-- that's real sweet, but I can't eat all this.
There's enough food here to feed the whole town off of.
Well... the whole town will be here.
- What?
- Uh-huh.
Wait, are-- are y'all throwing a party?
- Yeah!
- Sookie, come on.
In my house?
The day after--
I know what you're probably thinking, honey.
But death doesn't have to be such a sad thing.
Actually, it does.
Death is inherently sad.
I'm sad.
I'm not in the mood for a party.
Sook.
Sook!
Sook, what did you say last night when you came home?
About how this house was feeling so empty?
That's why we're gonna fill it up, so we can say "fuck you," to death and "hello," to life.
- Yeah.
- And that's what we're doing.
We are motherfucking celebrating life.
I'm going back to sleep.
What would Tara want?
What would Alcide want?
Alcide would want people to be around you tonight, Sookie.
Yes, ma'am, so take that pretty little ass of yours upstairs and get presentable.
'Cause folk gonna be here soon with some top-shelf alcohol, and I got one restriction-- not a nan person come up to you and say, "Oh, I'm sorry for your loss."
Mm-mm, none of that bullshit.
- Hear, hear, I say.
- That's right.
Come on, hooker.
Let's bring out the rest of the vittles and bits.
And that chicken Jenny made.
It ain't as good as mine.
Sookie?
Ugh, this is not happening.
- Am I early?
- Why, do I not look ready?
You know what, actually, best not answer that.
I only just now found out about the party I'm hosting tonight.
I see.
Um...
I didn't have any alcohol on hand, as requested.
My mother always taught me it was ungentlemanly to turn up to a gathering empty-handed, so, uh, I brought you these.
Well, I guess I'd better go upstairs and put my face on, but in the meantime, I invite you in.
Amber Mills?
Who are you?
I was always the black sheep of the family.
Started fangbanging right outta high school while Little Miss Perfect's marrying Steven Newlin.
She's not here.
Just like I told you she wasn't.
We had to be sure.
Your boyfriend?
Jeremy.
He was the one that turned me.
He helped me get my shit together.
But the second I turn, Sarah freaks.
She's married into the Fellowship of the Sun, after all.
But she knows I'm broke, so she starts paying me off, a monthly cash delivery to stay in the coffin.
Then she goes out and she tells the world that her sister was taken from her by those evil vampires, that I disappeared into thin air.
But I was here the whole time.
Jeremy and me sittin' around watching "House Hunters" marathons and drinkin' Tru Blood.
What happened to Jeremy?
Same thing that's happening to us.
One day, he gets the veins.
A few months later, he's dying in my arms.
Sometimes I beat myself up over it.
I mean, if I hadn't taken her money, if I had come out instead of hiding--
She would've had you killed and kept on walking.
None of this is your fault.
It's your sister's, which is why Pam and I are going after her.
And will you help us find her?
Are you gonna kill her?
There's a real good chance that's the way it's gonna go down.
Then you can count me in.
Mm.
I like her.
I like you.
Is it all right if I haven't made up my mind about you yet?
Yeah, I really like her.
When's the last time you saw Sarah?
Oh, it's been years now.
But she did call here this morning.
She said she just got to Dallas and she needed a place to hide.
I told her to fuck off.
She's in Dallas.
Any idea where else she might've gone?
Where she always goes, to Mommy and Daddy.
Even though she disgraced the family, they always fall for her BS.
And where do Mommy and Daddy live?
Why, Preston Hollow, of course.
But they won't be home tonight.
Probably already left for this.
The second I told her that's where Mommy and Daddy were going, she hung up.
She'll be there.
Looks like we're going to a gala.
Do you have a picture of your parents I can borrow?
You'll never get in.
You're vampires.
Security's gonna be tight and they only invited assholes.
You don't know us, sweetheart.
We can be assholes.
I want to go.
I want to say good-bye to my girl.
But there's gonna be alcohol and vampires at Sookie's.
Know how you're always saying that eyes are the windows to the soul?
Lettie Mae, please.
Look into mine.
I ain't going to that party looking for no vamper blood.
I just want to say good-bye 'cause there won't be no grave in no cemetery where I can visit my Tara.
Ain't nothing left of her to bury.
I'm so sorry, sweetheart, but no.
No, no, I have to do what's best for you whether you like it or not.
Now, look, let me take care of you tonight.
Please.
All right?
All right.
Now, come on, give me a taste, 'cause I wanna make this just how you like it.
Come on.
Needs cumin.

After what we all went through,
I'm gonna make some major changes in my life,

- That is great, Jane.
I'm gonna finally get my shit together.

- Amen.
Yeah.
Starting tomorrow.
I'm starting tomorrow, too, okay?
- To not dyin'.

If anyone knows how to live it up, it's you, Jane Bodehouse.
Minus.
Mr. Compton.
I ain't seen you since your daddy died.
It's good to see you, Minus.
What's going on?
Why's everyone goin'--
What's going on, William Compton... is that Lincoln has called his soldiers.
Called his soldiers?
Charles, are you saying--
That's right, William, war.
Everyone's going to enlist.
Based on our education and you and me being from prominent families, we're all but guaranteed to be made commissioned officers.
Isn't that thrilling'?
It is our God-given right to live our lives as we see fit,
- without interference.
- Yeah!
And I, for one, am willing to do whatever it takes to lay down my life if necessary to preserve that God-given right.
Are we gonna let a bunch of Yankee cowards come on down here and take our freedoms?
- Huh?
- No!
Then it is the sovereign right of the state of Louisiana to secede from the union.
Mr. DuPont's right.
Fort Sumter was just the beginning.
Yeah!
You see, we cannot, we must not let them destroy our way of life.
We have no choice but to fight.
Yeah!
With what?
This is a lost cause.
The Yankees have better artillery.
More sophisticated weaponry than we do.
What they will destroy is our town, scorch our land, our livelihoods.
Get outta my bar, William Compton.
We got no room here for Yankee sympathizers.
I'm sorry if you find the truth offensive, Mr. Bodehouse.
Get out!
Go ahead!
To not dyin'.
Hey, Sook.
You look real pretty.
Thanks, so do you.
Yeah, yeah, I have to admit finally getting a chance to shower up makes all the difference.
I was talking to Violet.
Oh.
Tsk.
Oh, Sookie, my sister.
Oh, I know we're not supposed to say we're sorry for your loss, but I am so very sorry.
I've had about a hundred boyfriends die on me over the years, but I remember how painful those first ones were.
There you are, Sookie.
You look like you could do with something eat.
I hear there are two kinds of chicken to try.
Excuse us.
What?
"I've had about a hundred boyfriends die on me, but I--"
Shut up and come dance with me.
♪ Don't be afraid, I'll show you tonight... ♪
Alcide could be an arrogant little shit, even when he was a kid.
You'd tell him to go left and he'd go right just to piss you off.
He'd question everything.
Now, fightin', it's a way of life where we come from, but Alcide, he wouldn't fight just for the sake of fighting'.
In fact, he told me once, "I'll fight when I'm good and ready.
I'll fight when I have something worth fighting for."
You were worth it, Sookie.
Otherwise he wouldn't have fought for you.
My boy died a hero.
But you can't die a hero without having a righteous cause.
Thank you.
To Alcide.
To Alcide.
- To Alcide.
- Alcide.
'Scuse me.
Uh-uh, no, Lettie Mae.
You can't come up in here causing no scene.
- Mm-mm.
- I am so sorry for your loss.
Lettie Mae.
You wanna say a few words about Tara?
First off, I'd like to say my heart goes out to you, Mr. Herveaux.
I'm sad for you, but I'm also glad for you because your son died a hero.
My Tara was a hero, too.
Most of you know I made some big mistakes raising her.
Most of you know I didn't raise her, that's 'cause you did-- her friends.
Still, though, she sacrificed herself trying to save me, even after all the pain I caused her.
And that's just beyond heroic in my book.
So I want to ask you to join me in raising a glass to her.
You got anything non-alcoholic?
Yeah.
Here you go.
Thank you, Deputy.
To my baby girl.
- To Tara.
- To Tara.
Thank you.
How's the party?
You should come inside.
I'm fine.
- Jessica--
- Andy.
I can't.
Did it ever occur to you that you torturing yourself over my girls keeps that pain alive for me, too?
You ever think about that?
This has been a hell of a week we're having, but during it you have been there.
You have been good to Adilyn.
You helped bring Holly back to me and her boys.
I don't know if I'm supposed to be taking some kind of message from all this bullshit that's been going on, but I'm taking one anyhow.
Life's too short.
Jessica, it's too fucking precious to always be looking backwards.
I'm moving forwards.
But I'm gonna need your help to do that.
How can I help?
You got a ring I can borrow?
A ring, but-- oh, my God.
Are you gonna propose to Holly tonight?
Please don't make this a bigger deal than it already is.
But it is a big deal.
I know that!
Jesus Christ, I'm freakin' out inside.
Just give me a ring before I change my mind.
Andy, you can't propose to Holly with any of these.
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
I ain't exactly had time to go to the mall.
Come on.
Wait up!
Are you sure you don't mind me borrowing it, Sookie?
Not at all.
Gran would've loved Holly.
Although she did leave it to Jason to give to the woman he was gonna marry.
That's right, she did.
You're already mine, Jason.
I don't need a ring to tell me that.
Well, here it is.
Oh, my God.
It's beautiful.
That's it?
Holy crap, I'm really gonna do this, huh?
Andy, you got yourself a real good woman, man.
It's all yours.
You seen your mother?
Uh, pretty sure she's in the living room.
Y'all are gonna wanna see this.
Oh, come here.
A little word to the wise.
I don't know if the two of you are fuckin' or not, but if you are, it's gonna have to stop right now.
You got it?
What's up?
Oh, you're bad.
Andy?
Andy, what's wrong?
Could we kill the music, please?
On it.
Andy, oh, my God.
What are you doing?
Holly, I-
- I'm-- I don't know--
I-
- I can't--
I don't know what I'm about to say, but I have been waiting for the perfect moment to do this, but something keeps getting in the way.
It wasn't until you went missing that I realized that something this whole time, was me.
See, I got this voice in my head that says I don't deserve a woman as beautiful as you are.
I don't deserve a woman as kind as you are.
And I probably don't, but...
I know the timing's weird and you got all kinds of healing to do.
- Oh.
- But, please... wear this ring for me?
I'll go through all of it with ya every step of the way.
Yes!
Aw!
I didn't ask you yet.
You gotta let me ask you.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Jumped the gun.
Uh, Holly Cleary, I love you with everything I got.
Will you marry me?
That's lovely, man.
I love you, Andy!
Let's go congratulate 'em.
Yeah.
- Hey.
- What?
What?
- You just seem happy is all.
- Well, I am.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Seriously?
Now?
Yeah, it's been a while since...
I know, but we're at-- we're at a party.
Okay?
Don't be such a wet blanket.
Just try to have fun and we'll leave later, okay?
Oh, man, what a surprise.
You doing okay?
Yeah.
You fixing' to cry?
I think I might be.
Come on, let's sneak upstairs.
Don't get me wrong, I am so happy for Andy and Holly.
It's just a little bit more of a celebration of life than I was ready for.
You miss him?
How can I miss someone I can't even believe is dead?
Alcide dying's a bit of a shock, sweetie.
That's the thing.
It never occurred to me that Alcide could die.
He's just... so-- so big and strong and he just--
It don't matter how big or strong someone is if someone else has a gun.
It was the same way with Terry.
It happened so fast, came out of nowhere.
The thing is, though, when it comes to loving a man and then losing him, it doesn't matter how it happens 'cause he's still gone.
You still have that hole inside you and it hurts just the same no matter how prepared you are for it or not.
When Terry died,
I thought I was gonna die right along with him.
How did you get through it?
At night, when no one was lookin'... sometimes I'd put his jacket on just so I could feel his arms around me again.
You never get over the loss of someone you love.
You just learn to live with it.
And nothing's gonna help heal this pain you're feeling but time.
And tequila.
How about a little tequila?
There's not enough tequila in the world to get me through tonight.
"Wet blanket"?
Do she even know who you is?
She gives me just enough love.
Mm.
And just enough affection to keep me hooked.
That's just like paying the minimum on your credit card bill each month just to keep that fucker from getting cancelled.
That's exactly what it's like.
Mm.
Jesus Christ, am I that fucking simple?
No, sir.
There's nothing simple about you at all.
The night we met, remember that story you told me about how you was turned?
Mm-hmm.
Can I ask a follow-up question?
Of course.
Danny Monoghan.
What about him?
Was y'all...
Yeah.
I told the sales woman my wife and I were going to an exclusive high society event and that only the very best would do.
Voilà.
Oh, my God.
I'm a republi-cunt.
- You think that's funny, huh?
- Mm-hmm.
Wait till you see what that nice man at Neiman's and I picked out for you.
Strip.
Oh, fuck, Eric.
You're stage two.
Just cover the ones that will be visible.
Okay.
I'm gonna die, Pam.
You have to accept that.
Whoo!
- My God, there he is.
- There who is?
That vampire who gave me his blood.
He's been making eyes at me ever since he got here.
- Evening, Arlene.
- Hey, Keith.
Um, Arlene here is super grateful on account of you, you know, saving her life last night and all, but she's been through a lot, so you might wanna,
I don't know, dial down your sexy a notch.
I understand.
And I can wait.
Sookie, would you please tell your friend Arlene here that I think she's the most beautiful woman I've seen in over 300 years?
And I'll see her in her dreams.
Um...
I have to go make tinkle because, you know, I am a human.
Arlene, have you seen James?
Huh?
James-- have you seen him?
I've been looking everywhere.
I think I saw him step outside with Lafayette a little while ago.
Thanks.
You incredible asshole!
- Get out of here.
- I am so sorry.
Really, James?
That's what you have to say?
That you are sorry?
Because need I remind you that I just found you fucking a man in our car.
- Jessica, please.
- Get the fuck out of my way.
Jess, will you please come outside and talk to me?
- Jason?
- Yeah, what's going on?
- Jessica, can we please talk about this?
- There is nothing to say.
Would you please rescind his invitation to this house?
What did he do?
What did you do?
I found him fucking Lafayette in the car that he and I bought together.
Get the fuck outta here, James.
- I should probably--
- Yeah, okay.
Go.
You all right?
Look, I just want to be alone right now.
Okay.
In case you need a place to crash, you know where I live.
You mean, with all that-- that sensitive musician shit, it never occurred to you that he might be gay?
I don't think that he is gay.
I think that he-- he's confused.
Jess, I gotta be honest with you.
Based on what you're telling me you saw him doing outside, it all sounds pretty gay to me.
Oh, my God.
- Who is it?
- It's me.
Go away!
Look, Red, I know this shit got to hurt--
Don't you dare presume to know me.
You do not know the first thing about me.
And you don't know the first thing about him.
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you.
You know what?
When was he turned?
How was he turned?
Who turned him?
And where's he from back before he got turned?
Miss ma'am, you don't know any of this shit, do you?
I do because I cared enough to ask him and he cared enough to tell me.
Now, listen, I--
I know the way this shit went down is real embarrassing.
But if you keep it 100 with yourself and honest, then you know this is not the man for you.
Because he's the man for you?
If he is, what's so fucking unimaginable about that, Red?
Huh?
Everybody else in this fucking town is falling in love and getting engaged and having babies.
Has it ever fucking occurred to you that Lafayette, that queen that make all you white heterosexuals laugh and feel good about yourselves, has it fucking ever occurred to you that maybe I want a piece of happiness, too?
No.
James is a good man.
He's a vampire, Lafayette.
Whatever he is.
If you don't love him, let him go.
And I will take over from here.
I was wrong about that Sookie Stackhouse.
It wasn't her fault all this happened.
Hep-vamps were taking out town after town.
I feel so bad about all the things I said about her.
Her guy gave his life for her.
Lost the man she loved trying to save our town.
So pretty.
I wonder if I'd have the courage to do the same for the woman I love.
She's lost more people than anyone.
Here she is being hostess.
She's got a heart bigger than all of Louisiana.
- Hey, Sookie.
- Hey.
You okay?
I'm drunk.
Oh, okay.
Well, you deserve to be.
Have you seen Arlene?
No, have-- have you seen Bill?
There's a safe house just on the other side of the bridge.
That's good people.
They'll give us food, shelter for the night... get our strength up... so we can keep going north come mornin'.
Shh, get down.
Everybody down.
- Keep going!
- All right, come on.
Shh, shh, shh.
Okay, they're gone.
We're safe.
You scared?
Yeah, I suppose I am.
All right, folks, it's gonna be all right.
We gots to keep moving, though.
- Let's go.
- We've come this far and we're almost--
Well, well, look who we have here.
You had no right to kill that man.
He was a good man.
- You had no goddamn right.
- Oh, actually, I do.
Now, if you would kindly hand over that map.
Do it!
Hey.
Hey!
No!
- No!
No!
- Get out of the way, Caroline!
Please, Charles, I beg of you!
Please think of the children!
You let that man serve as a warning of what we do to any and all deserters, no matter what their color.
Hyah!
Bill?
I'm coming out.
Is it safe?
Yeah, it's safe, Sookie.
You don't look quite right.
Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
I'm just thinkin' is all.
- Well, then, stop.
The whole point of this celebration is so that we don't sit around here with long faces.
You haven't socialized at all tonight.
I know everyone's pleased to see you here.
No, they're pleased to see you, Sookie.
You've done well.
You've done more these last several days than I've managed to achieve in decades.
Mainstream.
- I didn't do this.
- Yeah, you did.
Well...
I've had a lovely evening.
You can't leave yet.
No, I should be on my way.
But I had a wonderful time.
But I must admit this concept of men and women being friends was a little bit foreign in my day.
- Bill?
- Yeah?
Thank you.
For what?
For seeing me the way I can't see myself sometimes.
Come on.
Good night, Bill.
Good night, Sookie.
Look at her smilin' like that, how she lights up the room.
Heard Willa was here.
Can't figure out what my Tara's trying to tell me unless I get me some of Willa's blood.
Don't care if I have to stab her to get it.
Where's Willa?
Hey, where's Willa?
Who the fuck's Willa?
Dance with me.
No.
Willa!
Sugar, I've had a little too much to drink so you're gonna just have to get to the point.
Okay, since Eric released me,
I need a job, so I was wondering if maybe I could be a waitress--
Lettie Mae, stop!
What the fuck?
!
Get back!
Get the fuck back!
- I'm okay, I'm okay.
- She's okay.
She's okay, y'all.
Put your fangs away.
What the hell's goings on here?
Lettie Mae stabbed Willa.
Of course she did.
What the fuck, Auntie?
Tara has been trying to contact me from the other side.
She's stuck, and the only way I can find out what she needs is with Willa's blood.
Come on before you get killed.
Come on, come on.
You're all looking at me like I'm crazy, but it's only because I used to have a drinking problem that people don't believe me!
You stabbed somebody, Auntie!
That's why people think you crazy.
Come on.
You're all fucking crazy, if you ask me.
What the fuck are we doing here, huh?
When just three days ago a group of rabid vampires came and attacked the town and killed a bunch of people and kidnapped us, right?
Arlene, Jane, Holly, and I, we were fucking chained in a dungeon and we--
Let's go to another room and talk about this.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
- Yes.
No, no, Sam.
No!
I know you don't want to hear this, but it needs to be said 'cause it's real.
Damn it, people are dead, people are traumatized, and the reaction you all have to this is to throw a party?
You fucking kidding me?
Now, I ain't for stabbing people, but at least Lettie Mae gets it.
Shit, I mean, you all are going on like this shit's normal and it's not.
This shit doesn't happen in other towns.
- Take me home.
I wanna go home.
- Okay.
- I wanna go home.
- Okay, okay.
- Here's your knife.
- Thanks.
Hey, I'm gonna make sure they get home safe.
Thanks, Violet.
I don't know.
Maybe Lafayette is right.
- What about?
- James and I.
Maybe we don't belong together.
You did meet in a prison camp, Jess.
Careful, Jason.
You know, people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
I see your point.
Yeah, Violet.
She's pretty weird, ain't she?
I mean, she's-- she's ancient and sexy as hell, but she's a little...
- Off?
- Yeah.
She's way the fuck off sometimes.
You think maybe that's why...
No, why what?
We're supposed to be talking about you, Jess.
Yeah, I don't really feel like thinking about me anymore.
Go on, what?
Well, okay, then.
It was like earlier tonight when we were digging in trying to find Gran's ring to give it to Andy,
Violet was like, "I don't need a ring to prove to the world that you are mine."
All I kept thinking was, "Jesus, please.
Sweet baby Jesus, put that ring on Holly's finger before it winds up on Violet's."
I mean, that was my Gran's ring, Jess.
It meant a lot that she wanted to give that to me.
Hell, man, I would love to have put it on someone one day.
But if that someone had to be Violet...
I don't know.
- Oh, Jason.
- What?
I think you might just be the sweetest man in the world.
Of all the horrible things I've seen in the last 100 years, this could be the most disturbing.
Yeah.
Oh, come on.
It's fun because we're together.
No, it isn't.
What do Mommy and Daddy look like again?
Ah.
Someone's having a good time.
You think Daddy'd be enjoying himself this much if Sarah got to him first?
I'll get him alone.
You mingle, find the mother.
How?
All these bitches look the same.
Mommy?
Oh, my God.
Hi, Mommy.
Sarah, what in he--
The whole world is looking for you.
What are you doing here?
Have you lost your ever-lovin' mind?
Oh, my God.
I missed you so much.
You look so pretty in that suit.
I forgot how beautiful you were.
What do you want?
And what have you done to your hair?
I'm in trouble.
Well, no shit, baby girl.
No, I mean real trouble.
And I need help from someone high up.
Someone powerful, right here, right now.
Is Laura Bush out there?
No, she is not.
Well, can you call her?
Sarah, Laura stopped taking my calls just about the time that that book came out claiming that my daughter is the monster who created the monsters who are scaring the shit out of half the country.
Now, is that true?
Yes.
But I'm not a monster.
I'm a Buddhist.
What?
Look, you have got to get out of here.
If the liberal media finds out that you are at this event, they are never gonna let you be--
No, Mommy, stop.
Listen very closely.
The Yakuza are after me.
Oh, darlin'.
Paul?
I need to ask you some questions about your daughter.
Has she come to see you?
- The Yakuza?
- Uh-huh.
Go, move!
Get out!
- Where is your daughter?
- I don't know!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
- Come on!
- Go on, baby!
What are you doing out here, my love?
Someday soon you'll be buried here, too.
I don't want to fight.
But I don't see a way out.
- Do you?
- No.
I have loved you since the very first time I ever saw you.
Long back as I can remember.
You are my first and only true love.
And you are mine.
I will survive this war, Caroline.
And when it's all over, I will come back to you... and to the children.
I promise you.

I don't give a shit!
I am not going with you.
I would rather die than get in that coffin!
You will do what your maker tells you to do.
He may be my maker, but he sure as fuck didn't raise me.
Tara did.
She was the one who taught me how to feed, how to control my impulses.
He left, and then you left her when we needed you most.
We have bigger fucking problems than your mommy and your daddy--
- She died because of you!
- I am sorry--
Enough!
You're right.
I've been a terrible maker to you.
And for that I am truly sorry.
But I do not regret turning you, and I'm proud to call you my progeny.
Why did you come back for me?
Pam and I are gonna kill Sarah Newlin before I meet the true death.
You can count me out.
She was practically your stepmother, Willa.
If you have any idea where she might be,
I need to know it.
- I'm not going with you.
- Like fuck you aren't.
But I will tell you what I know if you release me.
Willa Burrell,
I renounce the ties of our blood and my dominion over you as my progeny.
As your maker...
I release you.
Like being kicked in the cooch by a wallaby, isn't it?
Sarah has a sister.
Oh, no shit, Willa.
The whole world knows that.
- You'd better know more.
- Her name is Amber.
Amber Mills.
And she's a vampire.
Oh.
How the fuck could Sarah Newlin have a vampire sister and the world not know about it?
I don't know, but I overheard her one night on the phone at the governor's mansion.
Sarah was warning her never to call there again or my father would send her to camp.
Any idea where this Amber lives?
The call came from a Dallas area code.
Good girl.
Ginger?
Tell the driver we're heading for Dallas.
And we'll only be needing two travel coffins.
What?
No!
You just got back.
And if you walk out that door,
I ain't never gonna see you again, am I?
Take me with you.
Put me in the third coffin.
- Sorry.
- What-- you're sorry?
I have been your sex slave for 15 years, Eric Northman, and we ain't never had sex.
Blow job, hand job, nothing.
Do you know what a sex slave is without the sex?
A slave?
Now, you are taking me with you to Dallas.
And if you can't fucking take me, then you had better fuckin' fuck me before you go.
Ginger, I'm diseased.
So the fuck am I!
No!

Sook?
Hey.
Hey.
I came as soon as I heard.
Ab-- about Alcide?
About everything.
How is you holding up?
The house is so empty.
Well, that big man of yours did take up a lot of space.
- Sorry.
- No, I'm sorry, Sook.
I gotta clean up.
- Jackson will be here in the morning.
- No, don't worry about that.
- We'll take care of this.
- No, what you need is some sleep.
When's the last time you got some serious shut-eye?
Come on, let me put you to bed.
Lafayette?
Yes, ma'am?
Don't leave.
Sook, I will be here when you wake up.
So don't fret, 'kay?
Night-night.
What the hell?
Look who's up.
- Where's all his--
- In the truck.
When Alcide's mama died, the hardest part was going through all her things.
You just say when you wanna go through it all, when you feel you're ready, and Jenny and me will have you out to the place and we'll figure it all out.
Yeah, we'll figure it out.
Hey!
The undead has arisen.
- Hey, there, Sookie.
- How'd you sleep?
Lafayette, you wanna tell me why there's enough food to choke a horse on my dining room table?
Child, me and Jenny was bustin' our humps cooking' all the livelong day.
Well, that's-- that's real sweet, but I can't eat all this.
There's enough food here to feed the whole town off of.
Well... the whole town will be here.
- What?
- Uh-huh.
Wait, are-- are y'all throwing a party?
- Yeah!
- Sookie, come on.
In my house?
The day after--
I know what you're probably thinking, honey.
But death doesn't have to be such a sad thing.
Actually, it does.
Death is inherently sad.
I'm sad.
I'm not in the mood for a party.
Sook.
Sook!
Sook, what did you say last night when you came home?
About how this house was feeling so empty?
That's why we're gonna fill it up, so we can say "fuck you," to death and "hello," to life.
- Yeah.
- And that's what we're doing.
We are motherfucking celebrating life.
I'm going back to sleep.
What would Tara want?
What would Alcide want?
Alcide would want people to be around you tonight, Sookie.
Yes, ma'am, so take that pretty little ass of yours upstairs and get presentable.
'Cause folk gonna be here soon with some top-shelf alcohol, and I got one restriction-- not a nan person come up to you and say, "Oh, I'm sorry for your loss."
Mm-mm, none of that bullshit.
- Hear, hear, I say.
- That's right.
Come on, hooker.
Let's bring out the rest of the vittles and bits.
And that chicken Jenny made.
It ain't as good as mine.
Sookie?
Ugh, this is not happening.
- Am I early?
- Why, do I not look ready?
You know what, actually, best not answer that.
I only just now found out about the party I'm hosting tonight.
I see.
Um...
I didn't have any alcohol on hand, as requested.
My mother always taught me it was ungentlemanly to turn up to a gathering empty-handed, so, uh, I brought you these.
Well, I guess I'd better go upstairs and put my face on, but in the meantime, I invite you in.
Amber Mills?
Who are you?
I was always the black sheep of the family.
Started fangbanging right outta high school while Little Miss Perfect's marrying Steven Newlin.
She's not here.
Just like I told you she wasn't.
We had to be sure.
Your boyfriend?
Jeremy.
He was the one that turned me.
He helped me get my shit together.
But the second I turn, Sarah freaks.
She's married into the Fellowship of the Sun, after all.
But she knows I'm broke, so she starts paying me off, a monthly cash delivery to stay in the coffin.
Then she goes out and she tells the world that her sister was taken from her by those evil vampires, that I disappeared into thin air.
But I was here the whole time.
Jeremy and me sittin' around watching "House Hunters" marathons and drinkin' Tru Blood.
What happened to Jeremy?
Same thing that's happening to us.
One day, he gets the veins.
A few months later, he's dying in my arms.
Sometimes I beat myself up over it.
I mean, if I hadn't taken her money, if I had come out instead of hiding--
She would've had you killed and kept on walking.
None of this is your fault.
It's your sister's, which is why Pam and I are going after her.
And will you help us find her?
Are you gonna kill her?
There's a real good chance that's the way it's gonna go down.
Then you can count me in.
Mm.
I like her.
I like you.
Is it all right if I haven't made up my mind about you yet?
Yeah, I really like her.
When's the last time you saw Sarah?
Oh, it's been years now.
But she did call here this morning.
She said she just got to Dallas and she needed a place to hide.
I told her to fuck off.
She's in Dallas.
Any idea where else she might've gone?
Where she always goes, to Mommy and Daddy.
Even though she disgraced the family, they always fall for her BS.
And where do Mommy and Daddy live?
Why, Preston Hollow, of course.
But they won't be home tonight.
Probably already left for this.
The second I told her that's where Mommy and Daddy were going, she hung up.
She'll be there.
Looks like we're going to a gala.
Do you have a picture of your parents I can borrow?
You'll never get in.
You're vampires.
Security's gonna be tight and they only invited assholes.
You don't know us, sweetheart.
We can be assholes.
I want to go.
I want to say good-bye to my girl.
But there's gonna be alcohol and vampires at Sookie's.
Know how you're always saying that eyes are the windows to the soul?
Lettie Mae, please.
Look into mine.
I ain't going to that party looking for no vamper blood.
I just want to say good-bye 'cause there won't be no grave in no cemetery where I can visit my Tara.
Ain't nothing left of her to bury.
I'm so sorry, sweetheart, but no.
No, no, I have to do what's best for you whether you like it or not.
Now, look, let me take care of you tonight.
Please.
All right?
All right.
Now, come on, give me a taste, 'cause I wanna make this just how you like it.
Come on.
Needs cumin.
Okay, all right, I'll...

I'm gonna make some major changes in my life,

If anyone knows how to live it up, it's you, Jane Bodehouse.
Minus.
Mr. Compton.
I ain't seen you since your daddy died.
It's good to see you, Minus.
What's going on?
Why's everyone goin'--
What's going on, William Compton... is that Lincoln has called his soldiers.
Called his soldiers?
Charles, are you saying--
That's right, William, war.
Everyone's going to enlist.
Based on our education and you and me being from prominent families, we're all but guaranteed to be made commissioned officers.
Isn't that thrilling'?
It is our God-given right to live our lives as we see fit,
- without interference.
- Yeah!
And I, for one, am willing to do whatever it takes to lay down my life if necessary to preserve that God-given right.
Are we gonna let a bunch of Yankee cowards come on down here and take our freedoms?
- Huh?
- No!
Then it is the sovereign right of the state of Louisiana to secede from the union.
Mr. DuPont's right.
Fort Sumter was just the beginning.
Yeah!
You see, we cannot, we must not let them destroy our way of life.
We have no choice but to fight.
Yeah!
With what?
This is a lost cause.
The Yankees have better artillery.
More sophisticated weaponry than we do.
What they will destroy is our town, scorch our land, our livelihoods.
Get outta my bar, William Compton.
We got no room here for Yankee sympathizers.
I'm sorry if you find the truth offensive, Mr. Bodehouse.
Get out!
Go ahead!
To not dyin'.
Hey, Sook.
You look real pretty.
Thanks, so do you.
Yeah, yeah, I have to admit finally getting a chance to shower up makes all the difference.
I was talking to Violet.
Oh.
Tsk.
Oh, Sookie, my sister.
Oh, I know we're not supposed to say we're sorry for your loss, but I am so very sorry.
I've had about a hundred boyfriends die on me over the years, but I remember how painful those first ones were.
There you are, Sookie.
You look like you could do with something eat.
I hear there are two kinds of chicken to try.
Excuse us.
What?
"I've had about a hundred boyfriends die on me, but I--"
Shut up and come dance with me.
♪ Don't be afraid, I'll show you tonight... ♪
Alcide could be an arrogant little shit, even when he was a kid.
You'd tell him to go left and he'd go right just to piss you off.
He'd question everything.
Now, fightin', it's a way of life where we come from, but Alcide, he wouldn't fight just for the sake of fighting'.
In fact, he told me once, "I'll fight when I'm good and ready.
I'll fight when I have something worth fighting for."
You were worth it, Sookie.
Otherwise he wouldn't have fought for you.
My boy died a hero.
But you can't die a hero without having a righteous cause.
Thank you.
To Alcide.
To Alcide.
- To Alcide.
- Alcide.
'Scuse me.
Uh-uh, no, Lettie Mae.
You can't come up in here causing no scene.
- Mm-mm.
- I am so sorry for your loss.
Lettie Mae.
You wanna say a few words about Tara?
First off, I'd like to say my heart goes out to you, Mr. Herveaux.
I'm sad for you, but I'm also glad for you because your son died a hero.
My Tara was a hero, too.
Most of you know I made some big mistakes raising her.
Most of you know I didn't raise her, that's 'cause you did-- her friends.
Still, though, she sacrificed herself trying to save me, even after all the pain I caused her.
And that's just beyond heroic in my book.
So I want to ask you to join me in raising a glass to her.
You got anything non-alcoholic?
Yeah.
Here you go.
Thank you, Deputy.
To my baby girl.
- To Tara.
- To Tara.
Thank you.
How's the party?
You should come inside.
I'm fine.
- Jessica--
- Andy.
I can't.
Did it ever occur to you that you torturing yourself over my girls keeps that pain alive for me, too?
You ever think about that?
This has been a hell of a week we're having, but during it you have been there.
You have been good to Adilyn.
You helped bring Holly back to me and her boys.
I don't know if I'm supposed to be taking some kind of message from all this bullshit that's been going on, but I'm taking one anyhow.
Life's too short.
Jessica, it's too fucking precious to always be looking backwards.
I'm moving forwards.
But I'm gonna need your help to do that.
How can I help?
You got a ring I can borrow?
A ring, but-- oh, my God.
Are you gonna propose to Holly tonight?
Please don't make this a bigger deal than it already is.
But it is a big deal.
I know that!
Jesus Christ, I'm freakin' out inside.
Just give me a ring before I change my mind.
Andy, you can't propose to Holly with any of these.
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
I ain't exactly had time to go to the mall.
Come on.
Wait up!
Are you sure you don't mind me borrowing it, Sookie?
Not at all.
Gran would've loved Holly.
Although she did leave it to Jason to give to the woman he was gonna marry.
That's right, she did.
You're already mine, Jason.
I don't need a ring to tell me that.
Well, here it is.
Oh, my God.
It's beautiful.
That's it?
Holy crap, I'm really gonna do this, huh?
Andy, you got yourself a real good woman, man.
It's all yours.
You seen your mother?
Uh, pretty sure she's in the living room.
Y'all are gonna wanna see this.
Oh, come here.
A little word to the wise.
I don't know if the two of you are fuckin' or not, but if you are, it's gonna have to stop right now.
You got it?
What's up?
Oh, you're bad.
Andy?
Andy, what's wrong?
Could we kill the music, please?
On it.
Andy, oh, my God.
What are you doing?
Holly, I-
- I'm-- I don't know--
I-
- I can't--
I don't know what I'm about to say, but I have been waiting for the perfect moment to do this, but something keeps getting in the way.
It wasn't until you went missing that I realized that something this whole time, was me.
See, I got this voice in my head that says I don't deserve a woman as beautiful as you are.
I don't deserve a woman as kind as you are.
And I probably don't, but...
I know the timing's weird and you got all kinds of healing to do.
- Oh.
- But, please... wear this ring for me?
I'll go through all of it with ya every step of the way.
Yes!
Aw!
I didn't ask you yet.
You gotta let me ask you.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Jumped the gun.
Uh, Holly Cleary, I love you with everything I got.
Will you marry me?
That's lovely, man.
I love you, Andy!
Let's go congratulate 'em.
Yeah.
- Hey.
- What?
What?
- You just seem happy is all.
- Well, I am.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Seriously?
Now?
Yeah, it's been a while since...
I know, but we're at-- we're at a party.
Okay?
Don't be such a wet blanket.
Just try to have fun and we'll leave later, okay?
Oh, man, what a surprise.
You doing okay?
Yeah.
You fixing' to cry?
I think I might be.
Come on, let's sneak upstairs.
Don't get me wrong, I am so happy for Andy and Holly.
It's just a little bit more of a celebration of life than I was ready for.
You miss him?
How can I miss someone I can't even believe is dead?
Alcide dying's a bit of a shock, sweetie.
That's the thing.
It never occurred to me that Alcide could die.
He's just... so-- so big and strong and he just--
It don't matter how big or strong someone is if someone else has a gun.
It was the same way with Terry.
It happened so fast, came out of nowhere.
The thing is, though, when it comes to loving a man and then losing him, it doesn't matter how it happens 'cause he's still gone.
You still have that hole inside you and it hurts just the same no matter how prepared you are for it or not.
When Terry died,
I thought I was gonna die right along with him.
How did you get through it?
At night, when no one was lookin'... sometimes I'd put his jacket on just so I could feel his arms around me again.
You never get over the loss of someone you love.
You just learn to live with it.
And nothing's gonna help heal this pain you're feeling but time.
And tequila.
How about a little tequila?
There's not enough tequila in the world to get me through tonight.
"Wet blanket"?
Do she even know who you is?
She gives me just enough love.
Mm.
And just enough affection to keep me hooked.
That's just like paying the minimum on your credit card bill each month just to keep that fucker from getting cancelled.
That's exactly what it's like.
Mm.
Jesus Christ, am I that fucking simple?
No, sir.
There's nothing simple about you at all.
The night we met, remember that story you told me about how you was turned?
Mm-hmm.
Can I ask a follow-up question?
Of course.
Danny Monoghan.
What about him?
Was y'all...
Yeah.
I told the sales woman my wife and I were going to an exclusive high society event and that only the very best would do.
Voilà.
Oh, my God.
I'm a republi-cunt.
- You think that's funny, huh?
- Mm-hmm.
Wait till you see what that nice man at Neiman's and I picked out for you.
Strip.
Oh, fuck, Eric.
You're stage two.
Just cover the ones that will be visible.
Okay.
I'm gonna die, Pam.
You have to accept that.
Whoo!
- My God, there he is.
- There who is?
That vampire who gave me his blood.
He's been making eyes at me ever since he got here.
- Evening, Arlene.
- Hey, Keith.
Um, Arlene here is super grateful on account of you, you know, saving her life last night and all, but she's been through a lot, so you might wanna,
I don't know, dial down your sexy a notch.
I understand.
And I can wait.
Sookie, would you please tell your friend Arlene here that I think she's the most beautiful woman I've seen in over 300 years?
And I'll see her in her dreams.
Um...
I have to go make tinkle because, you know, I am a human.
Arlene, have you seen James?
Huh?
James-- have you seen him?
I've been looking everywhere.
I think I saw him step outside with Lafayette a little while ago.
Thanks.
You incredible asshole!
- Get out of here.
- I am so sorry.
Really, James?
That's what you have to say?
That you are sorry?
Because need I remind you that I just found you fucking a man in our car.
- Jessica, please.
- Get the fuck out of my way.
Jess, will you please come outside and talk to me?
- Jason?
- Yeah, what's going on?
- Jessica, can we please talk about this?
- There is nothing to say.
Would you please rescind his invitation to this house?
What did he do?
What did you do?
I found him fucking Lafayette in the car that he and I bought together.
Get the fuck outta here, James.
- I should probably--
- Yeah, okay.
Go.
You all right?
Look, I just want to be alone right now.
Okay.
In case you need a place to crash, you know where I live.
You mean, with all that-- that sensitive musician shit, it never occurred to you that he might be gay?
I don't think that he is gay.
I think that he-- he's confused.
Jess, I gotta be honest with you.
Based on what you're telling me you saw him doing outside, it all sounds pretty gay to me.
Oh, my God.
- Who is it?
- It's me.
Go away!
Look, Red, I know this shit got to hurt--
Don't you dare presume to know me.
You do not know the first thing about me.
And you don't know the first thing about him.
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you.
You know what?
When was he turned?
How was he turned?
Who turned him?
And where's he from back before he got turned?
Miss ma'am, you don't know any of this shit, do you?
I do because I cared enough to ask him and he cared enough to tell me.
Now, listen, I--
I know the way this shit went down is real embarrassing.
But if you keep it 100 with yourself and honest, then you know this is not the man for you.
Because he's the man for you?
If he is, what's so fucking unimaginable about that, Red?
Huh?
Everybody else in this fucking town is falling in love and getting engaged and having babies.
Has it ever fucking occurred to you that Lafayette, that queen that make all you white heterosexuals laugh and feel good about yourselves, has it fucking ever occurred to you that maybe I want a piece of happiness, too?
No.
James is a good man.
He's a vampire, Lafayette.
Whatever he is.
If you don't love him, let him go.
And I will take over from here.
I was wrong about that Sookie Stackhouse.
It wasn't her fault all this happened.
Hep-vamps were taking out town after town.
I feel so bad about all the things I said about her.
Her guy gave his life for her.
Lost the man she loved trying to save our town.
So pretty.
I wonder if I'd have the courage to do the same for the woman I love.
She's lost more people than anyone.
Here she is being hostess.
She's got a heart bigger than all of Louisiana.
- Hey, Sookie.
- Hey.
You okay?
I'm drunk.
Oh, okay.
Well, you deserve to be.
Have you seen Arlene?
No, have-- have you seen Bill?
There's a safe house just on the other side of the bridge.
That's good people.
They'll give us food, shelter for the night... get our strength up... so we can keep going north come mornin'.
Shh, get down.
Everybody down.
- Keep going!
- All right, come on.
Shh, shh, shh.
Okay, they're gone.
We're safe.
You scared?
Yeah, I suppose I am.
All right, folks, it's gonna be all right.
We gots to keep moving, though.
- Let's go.
- We've come this far and we're almost--
Well, well, look who we have here.
You had no right to kill that man.
He was a good man.
- You had no goddamn right.
- Oh, actually, I do.
Now, if you would kindly hand over that map.
Do it!
Hey.
Hey!
No!
- No!
No!
- Get out of the way, Caroline!
Please, Charles, I beg of you!
Please think of the children!
You let that man serve as a warning of what we do to any and all deserters, no matter what their color.
Hyah!
Bill?
I'm coming out.
Is it safe?
Yeah, it's safe, Sookie.
You don't look quite right.
Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
I'm just thinkin' is all.
- Well, then, stop.
The whole point of this celebration is so that we don't sit around here with long faces.
You haven't socialized at all tonight.
I know everyone's pleased to see you here.
No, they're pleased to see you, Sookie.
You've done well.
You've done more these last several days than I've managed to achieve in decades.
Mainstream.
- I didn't do this.
- Yeah, you did.
Well...
I've had a lovely evening.
You can't leave yet.
No, I should be on my way.
But I had a wonderful time.
But I must admit this concept of men and women being friends was a little bit foreign in my day.
- Bill?
- Yeah?
Thank you.
For what?
For seeing me the way I can't see myself sometimes.
Come on.
Good night, Bill.
Good night, Sookie.
Look at her smilin' like that, how she lights up the room.
Heard Willa was here.
Can't figure out what my Tara's trying to tell me unless I get me some of Willa's blood.
Don't care if I have to stab her to get it.
Where's Willa?
Hey, where's Willa?
Who the fuck's Willa?
Dance with me.
No.
Willa!
Sugar, I've had a little too much to drink so you're gonna just have to get to the point.
Okay, since Eric released me,
I need a job, so I was wondering if maybe I could be a waitress--
Lettie Mae, stop!
What the fuck?
!
Get back!
Get the fuck back!
- I'm okay, I'm okay.
- She's okay.
She's okay, y'all.
Put your fangs away.
What the hell's goings on here?
Lettie Mae stabbed Willa.
Of course she did.
What the fuck, Auntie?
Tara has been trying to contact me from the other side.
She's stuck, and the only way I can find out what she needs is with Willa's blood.
Come on before you get killed.
Come on, come on.
You're all looking at me like I'm crazy, but it's only because I used to have a drinking problem that people don't believe me!
You stabbed somebody, Auntie!
That's why people think you crazy.
Come on.
You're all fucking crazy, if you ask me.
What the fuck are we doing here, huh?
When just three days ago a group of rabid vampires came and attacked the town and killed a bunch of people and kidnapped us, right?
Arlene, Jane, Holly, and I, we were fucking chained in a dungeon and we--
Let's go to another room and talk about this.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
- Yes.
No, no, Sam.
No!
I know you don't want to hear this, but it needs to be said 'cause it's real.
Damn it, people are dead, people are traumatized, and the reaction you all have to this is to throw a party?
You fucking kidding me?
Now, I ain't for stabbing people, but at least Lettie Mae gets it.
Shit, I mean, you all are going on like this shit's normal and it's not.
This shit doesn't happen in other towns.
- Take me home.
I wanna go home.
- Okay.
- I wanna go home.
- Okay, okay.
- Here's your knife.
- Thanks.
Hey, I'm gonna make sure they get home safe.
Thanks, Violet.
I don't know.
Maybe Lafayette is right.
- What about?
- James and I.
Maybe we don't belong together.
You did meet in a prison camp, Jess.
Careful, Jason.
You know, people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
I see your point.
Yeah, Violet.
She's pretty weird, ain't she?
I mean, she's-- she's ancient and sexy as hell, but she's a little...
- Off?
- Yeah.
She's way the fuck off sometimes.
You think maybe that's why...
No, why what?
We're supposed to be talking about you, Jess.
Yeah, I don't really feel like thinking about me anymore.
Go on, what?
Well, okay, then.
It was like earlier tonight when we were digging in trying to find Gran's ring to give it to Andy,
Violet was like, "I don't need a ring to prove to the world that you are mine."
All I kept thinking was, "Jesus, please.
Sweet baby Jesus, put that ring on Holly's finger before it winds up on Violet's."
I mean, that was my Gran's ring, Jess.
It meant a lot that she wanted to give that to me.
Hell, man, I would love to have put it on someone one day.
But if that someone had to be Violet...
I don't know.
- Oh, Jason.
- What?
I think you might just be the sweetest man in the world.
Of all the horrible things I've seen in the last 100 years, this could be the most disturbing.
Yeah.
Oh, come on.
It's fun because we're together.
No, it isn't.
What do Mommy and Daddy look like again?
Ah.
Someone's having a good time.
You think Daddy'd be enjoying himself this much if Sarah got to him first?
I'll get him alone.
You mingle, find the mother.
How?
All these bitches look the same.
Mommy?
Oh, my God.
Hi, Mommy.
Sarah, what in he--
The whole world is looking for you.
What are you doing here?
Have you lost your ever-lovin' mind?
Oh, my God.
I missed you so much.
You look so pretty in that suit.
I forgot how beautiful you were.
What do you want?
And what have you done to your hair?
I'm in trouble.
Well, no shit, baby girl.
No, I mean real trouble.
And I need help from someone high up.
Someone powerful, right here, right now.
Is Laura Bush out there?
No, she is not.
Well, can you call her?
Sarah, Laura stopped taking my calls just about the time that that book came out claiming that my daughter is the monster who created the monsters who are scaring the shit out of half the country.
Now, is that true?
Yes.
But I'm not a monster.
I'm a Buddhist.
What?
Look, you have got to get out of here.
If the liberal media finds out that you are at this event, they are never gonna let you be--
No, Mommy, stop.
Listen very closely.
The Yakuza are after me.
Oh, darlin'.
Paul?
I need to ask you some questions about your daughter.
Has she come to see you?
- The Yakuza?
- Uh-huh.
Go, move!
Get out!
- Where is your daughter?
- I don't know!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
- Come on!
- Go on, baby!
What are you doing out here, my love?
Someday soon you'll be buried here, too.
I don't want to fight.
But I don't see a way out.
- Do you?
- No.
I have loved you since the very first time I ever saw you.
Long back as I can remember.
You are my first and only true love.
And you are mine.
I will survive this war, Caroline.
And when it's all over, I will come back to you... and to the children.
I promise you.

[GINGER GASPING AND WHIMPERING]
I don't give a shit.
I am not going with you.
- I would rather die than get in that coffin.
-You will do what your maker tells you.
He may be my maker, but he sure as fuck didn't raise me.
Tara did.
She was the one who taught me how to feed how to control my impulses.
He left, and then you left her when we needed you most.
We have bigger problems than your mommy--
- She died because of you!
ERIC:
Enough!
[SIGHS]
You're right.
I've been a terrible maker to you.
And for that I am truly sorry.
But I do not regret turning you and I am proud to call you my progeny.
Why did you come back for me?
Pam and I are gonna kill Sarah Newlin before I meet the true death.
You can count me out.
She was practically your stepmother, Willa.
If you have any idea where she might be I need to know it.
- I'm not going with you.
- Like fuck you aren't.
WILLA:
But I will tell you what I know if you release me.
Willa Burrell I renounce the ties of our blood and my dominion over you as my progeny.
As your maker I release you.
[PANTING THEN SIGHS]
Like being kicked in the coach by a wallaby, isn't it?
Sarah has a sister.
Oh, no shit, Willa.
The whole world knows that.
- You'd better know more.
-Her name is Amber.
- Amber Mills.
-Mm.
And she's a vampire.
Oh...
Heh.
How the fuck could Sarah Newlin have a vampire sister and the world not know it?
I don't know, but I overheard her one night on the phone at the governor's mansion.
Sarah was warning her never to call there again or my father would send her to camp.
Any idea where this Amber lives?
The call came from a Dallas area code.
Good girl.
Ginger?
Tell the driver we're heading for Dallas.
And we'll only be needing two travel coffins.
What?
No.
You just got back.
And if you walk out that door, I ain't never gonna see you again, am I?
Take me with you.
Put me in the third coffin.
- Sorry.
-Wha--?
You're sorry?
I have been your sex slave for 15 years, Eric Northman and we ain't never had sex.
Blow job, hand job, nothing.
Do you know what a sex slave is without the sex?
A slave?
Now, you are taking me with you to Dallas.
And if you can't fucking take me then you had better fucking fuck me before you go.
Ginger, I'm diseased.
So the fuck am I.
[SCREAMING]
No!
[CONTINUES SCREAMING]
LAFAYETTE:
Sook?
Hey.
SOOKIE:
Hey.
I came as soon as I heard.
About Alcide?
About everything.
How is you holding up?
[VOICE BREAKING] The house is so empty.
Well, that big man of yours did take up a lot of space.
- Sorry.
-No, I'm sorry, Sook.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] I gotta clean up.
Jackson will be here in the morning--
- No, don't worry about that.
-No, what you need is some sleep.
When's the last time you got some shut-eye?
Let me put you to bed.
- Lafayette?
-Yes, ma'am?
Don't leave.
Sook, I will be here when you wake up.
So don't fret, okay?
Night-night.
[CLATTERING]
[THUDDING]
SOOKIE:
What the hell?
[DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES]
Look who's up.
- Where's all his--?
-In the truck.
Uh...
When Alcide's mama died, the hardest part was going through all her things.
You just say when you wanna go through it all when you feel you're ready and Jenny and me will have you out to the place and we'll figure it all out.
Yeah, we'll figure it out.
[JAMES JENNY LAUGHING]
Hey.
The undead has arisen.
- Hey, Sookie.
-How'd you sleep?
You wanna tell me why there's enough food to choke a horse on my dining room table?
Child, me and Jenny was busting our humps cooking all the livelong day.
Well, that's-
- That's real sweet but I can't eat all this.
There's enough food here to feed the whole town off of.
Well the whole town will be here.
[LAFAYETTE JENNY CHUCKLE]
- What?
-Uh-huh.
Wait, are--?
Are y'all throwing a party?
- Yeah.
Sookie, come on.
-In my house?
The day after--
I know what you're probably thinking, honey.
But death doesn't have to be such a sad thing.
Actually, it does.
Death is inherently sad.
I'm sad.
I'm not in the mood for a party.
Sook.
Sook.
Sook, what did you say last night when you came home?
About how this house was feeling so empty?
That's why we gonna fill it up.
So we can say "fuck you" to death and "hello" to life.
JENNY:
Yeah.
-And that's what we doing.
We are motherfucking celebrating life.
I'm going back to sleep.
What would Tara want?
What would Alcide want?
Alcide would want people to be around you tonight.
Yes, ma'am, so take that pretty little ass of yours upstairs and get presentable.
Because folk gonna be here soon with some top-shelf alcohol and I got one restriction.
Not a nan person come up to you and say:
"Oh, I'm sorry for your loss." Mm-mm.
None of that bullshit.
- Hear, hear, I say.
JAMES:
That's right.
LAFAYETTE:
Come on, hooker.
Let's bring out the vittles and bits.
JAMES:
And that chicken Jenny made.
LAFAYETTE:
It ain't as good as mine.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
BILL:
Sookie?
Oh.
This is not happening.
- Am I early?
-Why?
Do I not look ready?
Actually, best not answer that.
I only just now found out about the party I'm hosting tonight.
I see.
Um...
I didn't have any alcohol on hand, as requested.
My mother always taught me it was ungentlemanly to turn up to a gathering empty-handed so I brought you these.
Well, I guess I'd better go upstairs and put my face on but in the meantime, I invite you in.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
Amber Mills?
Who are you?
AMBER:
I was always the black sheep of the family.
Started fangbanging right out of high school while Little Miss Perfect's marrying Steven Newlin.
[WHOOSHING]
- She's not here.
-Just like I told you she wasn't.
We had to be sure.
Your boyfriend?
Jeremy.
He was the one that turned me.
He helped me get my shit together.
But the second I turn, Sarah freaks.
She's married into the Fellowship of the Sun, after all.
But she knows I'm broke so she starts paying me off, a monthly cash delivery to stay in the coffin.
Then she goes out and she tells the world that her sister was taken by those evil vampires that I disappeared into thin air.
But I was here the whole time.
Jeremy and me sitting around watching House Hunters marathons and drinking Tru Blood.
What happened to Jeremy?
Same thing that's happening to us.
One day, he gets the veins.
A few months later, he's dying in my arms.
Sometimes I beat myself up over it.
If I hadn't taken her money, if I had come out--
She would have had you killed and kept on walking.
None of this is your fault.
It's your sister's which is why Pam and I are going after her.
And will you help us find her?
Are you gonna kill her?
There's a real good chance that's the way it's gonna go down.
Then you can count me in.
ERIC:
Mm.
-I like her.
I like you.
Is it all right if I haven't made up my mind about you yet?
Yeah, I really like her.
When's the last time you saw Sarah?
Oh, it's been years now.
But she did call here this morning.
She said she just got to Dallas and she needed a place to hide.
I told her to fuck off.
She's in Dallas.
Any idea where else she might've gone?
Where she always goes, to Mommy and Daddy.
Even though she disgraced the family, they always fall for her BS.
And where do Mommy and Daddy live?
Why, Preston Hollow, of course.
But they won't be home tonight.
Probably already left for this.
The second I told her that's where Mommy and Daddy were going, she hung up.
- She'll be there.
-Looks like we're going to a gala.
You have a picture of your parents I can borrow?
You'll never get in.
You're vampires.
Security's gonna be tight and they only invited assholes.
You don't know us, sweetheart.
We can be assholes.
I wanna go.
I wanna say goodbye to my girl.
There's gonna be alcohol and vampires at Sookie's.
Know how you're always saying that eyes are the windows to the soul?
Lettie Mae, please.
Look into mine.
I ain't going to that party looking for no vamper blood.
I just wanna say goodbye because there won't be no grave in no cemetery where I can visit my Tara.
Ain't nothing left of her to bury.
I'm so sorry, sweetheart, but no.
No, no, I have to do what's best for you whether you like it or not.
Now, look, let me take care of you tonight.
Please.
All right?
All right.
Now, come on, give me a taste because I wanna make this just how you like it.
Come on.
Needs cumin.
Okay, all right, I'll...

-Hey.
[GRUNTING]
Well, ladies, we dodged a bullet.
- Yeah, we did.
-Whoo!
Amazing what a little shut-eye can do to calm the nerves.
You know what, girls?
After what we all went through I'm gonna make some major changes in my life clean up my act.
-That is great, Jane.
I'm gonna finally get my shit together.
HOLLY:
Amen.
-Good for you, girl.
Starting tomorrow.
[ALL LAUGHING]
HOLLY:
I'm starting tomorrow too, okay?

-Amen.
ARLENE:
If anyone knows how to live it up, it's you, Jane Bodehouse.
[HORSE NEIGHS]
Minus.
Mr. Compton.
I ain't seen you since your daddy died.
It's good to see you, Minus.
- What's going on?
Why's everyone going--?
-What's going on, William Compton is that Lincoln has called his soldiers.
Called his soldiers?
- Charles, are you saying-J?
-That's right, William, war.
Everyone's gonna enlist.
Based on our education and you and me being from prominent families we're guaranteed to be made commissioned officers.
Isn't that thrilling?
[CHUCKLES]
[CROWD CHEERS]
It is our God-given right to live our lives as we see fit without interference.
And I, for one, am willing to do whatever it takes to lay down my life, if necessary to preserve that God-given right.
Are we gonna let a bunch of Yankee cowards...
- Huh?
CROWD:
No!
Then it is the sovereign right of the state of Louisiana to secede from the union!
[CROWD CHEERS]
Mr. Dupont's right.
Fort Sumter was just the beginning.
[CROWD CHEERS]
You see, we cannot, we must not let them destroy our way of life.
We have no choice but to fight.
[CROWD CHEERS]
With what?
[CROWD MURMURING]
This is a lost cause.
The Yankees have better artillery and more sophisticated weaponry than we do.
What they will destroy is our town.
Scorch our land and our livelihoods.
BODEHOUSE:
Get out of my bar, William Compton.
We got no room here for Yankee sympathizers.
I'm sorry if you find the truth offensive, Mr. Bodehouse.

Coward.
Get out.

Hey, Sook.
- You look real pretty.
-Thanks, so do you.
Yeah.
Yeah, I have to admit finally getting a chance to shower up makes all the difference.
I was talking to Violet.
- Oh.
-Tsk.
Oh, Sookie, my sister.
Oh, I know we're not supposed to say we're sorry for your loss but I am so very sorry.
I've had about a hundred boyfriends die on me over the years but I remember how painful those first ones were.
There you are, Sookie.
You look like you could do with something to eat.
I hear there are two kinds of chicken to try.
Excuse us.
What?
"I've had about a hundred boyfriends die on me, but I--"
Shut up and come dance with me.

[SNORING SOFTLY]
Alcide could be an arrogant little shit even when he was a kid.
You'd tell him to go left, and he'd go right just to piss you off.
He'd question everything.
Now, fighting it's a way of life where we come from.
But Alcide, he wouldn't fight just for the sake of fighting.
In fact, he told me once, "I'll fight when I'm good and ready.
I'll fight when I have something worth fighting for."
You were worth it, Sookie.
Otherwise he wouldn't have fought for you.
My boy died a hero.
But you can't die a hero without having a righteous cause.
Thank you.
To Alcide.
- To Alcide.
ALL:
Alcide.
LETTIE MAE:
Excuse me.
Uh-uh.
No, Lettie Mae.
You can't come up in here causing no scene.
- Mm-mm.
-I am so sorry for your loss.
Lettie Mae.
You wanna say a few words about Tara?
[LAFAYETTE SIGHS]
LETTIE MAE:
First off, I'd like to say my heart goes out to you, Mr. Herveaux.
I'm sad for you but I'm also glad for you, because your son died a hero.
My Tara was a hero too.
Most of you know I made some big mistakes raising her.
Most of you know I didn't raise her.
That's because you did.
Her friends.
Still, though she sacrificed herself trying to save me even after all the pain I caused her.
And that's just beyond heroic in my book.
So I wanna ask you to join me in raising a glass to her.
You got anything non-alcoholic?
JASON:
Yeah.
Here you go.
Thank you, deputy.
To my baby girl.
To Tara.
ALL:
To Tara.
[MOUTHS] Thank you.
How's the party?
You should come inside.
JESSICA:
I'm fine.
- Jessica--
-Andy.
I can't.
Did it ever occur to you that you torturing yourself over my girls keeps that pain alive for me too?
You ever think about that?
This has been a hell of a week we're having, but during it you have been there.
You have been good to Adilyn.
You helped bring Holly back to me and her boys.
I don't know if I'm supposed to be taking some message from all this bullshit that's been going on, but I'm taking one anyhow.
Life's too shun.
Jessica, it's too fucking precious to always be looking backwards.
I'm moving forwards.
But I'm gonna need your help to do that.
How can I help?
You got a ring I can borrow?
A ring, but--?
Oh, my God.
- Are you gonna propose to Holly tonight?
-Please don't make this a bigger deal than it already is.
-Oh.
But it is a big deal.
I know that.
Jesus Christ, I'm freaking out inside.
Just give me a ring before I change my mind.
Andy, you can't propose to Holly with any of these.
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
I ain't exactly had time to go to the mall.
Come on.
Wait up.
Are you sure you don't mind me borrowing it, Sookie?
SOOKIE:
Not at all.
Gran would've loved Holly.
Although she did leave it to Jason to give to the woman he was gonna marry.
JASON:
That's right, she did.
You're already mine, Jason.
I don't need a ring to tell me that.
Well, here it is.
JESSICA:
Oh, my God.
It's beautiful.
That's it?
Holy crap, I'm really gonna do this, huh?
[JESSICA CHUCKLES]
Andy you got yourself a real good woman, man.
It's all yours.
[BOTH LAUGH]
- You seen your mother?
-Uh, pretty sure she's in the living room.

Andy, oh, my God.
What are you doing?
Holly, I-
- I'm--
I don't know-
- I-
- I can't--
I don't know what I'm about to say but I have been waiting for the perfect moment to do this but something keeps getting in the way.
It wasn't until you went missing that I realized that something this whole time was me.
See, I got this voice in my head that says I don't deserve a woman as beautiful as you are.
I don't deserve a woman as kind as you are.
And I probably don't, but...
I know the timing's weird, and you got all kinds of healing to do...
- Oh.
-...but, please wear this ring for me?
I'll go through all of it with you every step of the way.
-Yes.
[PEOPLE MURMURING]

-Yeah.
- Hey.
-What?
What?
- You just seem happy is all.
-Well, I am.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Seriously?
Now?
Yeah, it's been a while since...
I know, but we're at a party.
Okay?
Don't be such a wet blanket.
Just try to have fun, and we'll leave later, okay?
SAM:
Oh, man.
What a surprise.
You doing okay?
- Yeah.
-You fixing to cry?
I think I might be.
Come on, let's sneak upstairs.
Don't get me wrong, I am so happy for Andy and Holly.
It's just a little bit more of a celebration of life than I was ready for.
You miss him?
How can I miss someone I can't even believe is dead?
ARLENE:
Alcide dying's a bit of a shock, sweetie.
SOOKIE:
That's the thing.
It never occurred to me that Alcide could die.
He's just so big and strong, and he just--
It don't matter how big or strong someone is if someone else has a gun.
It was the same way with Terry.
It happened so fast, came out of nowhere.
The thing is, though when it comes to loving a man and then losing him it doesn't matter how it happens, because he's still gone.
You still have that hole inside you, and it hurts just the same no matter how prepared you are for it or not.
Oh.
When Terry died, I thought I was gonna die right along with him.
How did you get through it?
[SIGHS]
At night, when no one was looking sometimes I'd put his jacket on just so I could feel his arms around me again.
[CHUCKLES]
You never get over the loss of someone you love.
You just learn to live with it.
And nothing's gonna help heal this pain you're feeling but time.
And tequila.
[BOTH LAUGHING]
How about a little tequila?
SOOKIE:
There's not enough tequila in the world to get me through tonight.
"Wet blanket"?
Do she even know who you is?
- She gives me just enough love.
-Mm.
And just enough affection to keep me hooked.
That's just like paying the minimum on your credit card bill each month just to keep that fucker from getting canceled.
That's exactly what it's like.
- Mm.
-Jesus Christ, am I that fucking simple?
No, sir.
There's nothing simple about you at all.
The night we met remember that story you told me about how you was turned?
- Mm-hm.
-Can I ask a follow-up question?
Of course.
Danny Monoghan.
What about him?
Was y'all...?
Yeah.
I told the saleswoman my wife and I were going to an exclusive high-society event and that only the very best would do.
Voila'.
Oh, my God.
I'm a Republi-cunt.
[CHUCKLES]
- You think that's funny, huh?
-Mm-hm.
Wait till you see what that nice man at Neiman's and I picked out for you.
Strip.
Oh, fuck, Eric.
You're stage two.
Just cover the ones that will be visible.
Okay.
[PAM SIGHS]
I'm gonna die, Pam.
You have to accept that.

[UPBEAT POP MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
Whoo!
[GASPS]
- My God, there he is.
SOOKIE:
There who is?
That vampire who gave me his blood.
He's been making eyes at me ever since he got here.
Evening, Arlene.
SOOKIE:
Heh.
Hey, Keith.
Um, Arlene here is super grateful on account of you, you know saving her life last night and all, but she's been through a lot, so you might wanna I don't know, dial down your sexy a notch.
KEITH:
Heh.
[CHUCKLING]
I understand.
And I can wait.
Sookie, would you please tell your friend that I think she's the most beautiful woman I've seen in over 300 years?
[WHISPERING] And I'll see her in her dreams.
Um...
I have to go make tinkle because, you know, I am a human.
Arlene, have you seen James?
- Huh?
-James.
Have you seen him?
I've been looking everywhere.
I think I saw him step outside with Lafayette a little while ago.
Thanks.
[GRUNTING AND PANTING]
You incredible asshole!
- Get out of here.
-I am so sorry.
Really, James?
That's what you have to say?
That you are sorry?
Need I remind you that I just found you fucking a man in our car?
Jessica, please--
Get the fuck out of my way.
JAMES:
Will you come outside and talk to me?
- Jason?
-Yeah, what's going on?
- Can we please talk?
-There is nothing to say.
Would you rescind his invitation to this house?
- What'd he do?
What did you do?
-I found him fucking Lafayette in the car that he and I bought together.
Get the fuck out of here, James.
[DOOR CLOSES]
- I should probably--
-Yeah, okay.
Go.
You all right?
Look.
I just wanna be alone right now.
Okay.
In case you need a place to crash, you know where I live.
[SIGHS]
You mean with all that--
That sensitive musician shit, it never occurred to you that he might be gay?
I don't think that he is gay.
I think that he-
- He's just--
- He's confused.
-Jess, I gotta be honest with you.
Based on what you saw him doing outside it all sounds pretty gay to me.
-Oh, my God.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
- Who is it?
LAFAYETTE:
It's me.
Go away.
JASON:
Whoa.
-Look, Red, I know this shit got to hurt--
Don't you dare presume to know me.
You do not know the first thing about me.
And you don't know the first thing about him.
- Fuck you!
-Fuck you.
You know what?
When was he turned?
How was he turned?
Who turned him?
And where's he from back before he got turned?
Ms. Ma'am, you don't know any of this shit, do you?
I do because I cared enough to ask him, and he cared enough to tell me.
Now, listen, I know the way this shit went down is real embarrassing.
But if you keep it 100 with yourself and honest you know this is not the man for you.
- He's the man for you?
-If he is what's so fucking unimaginable about that, Red?
Huh?
Everybody else in this town is falling in love and getting engaged and having babies.
Has it ever occurred to you that Lafayette, that queen that make all you white heterosexuals laugh and feel good about yourselves...
Has it fucking ever occurred to you that maybe I want a piece of happiness too?
No.
[SIGHS]
James is a good man.
He's a vampire, Lafayette.
Whatever he is.
If you don't love him, let him go.
And I will take over from here.
WOMAN 1:
I was wrong about that Sookie Stackhouse.
It wasn't her fault.
Hep-vamps were taking out town after town.
WOMAN 2:
I feel bad about the things I said.
MAN:
Her guy gave his life for her.
WOMAN3:
Lost the man she loved trying to save our town.
So pretty.
MAN:
I wonder if I'd have the courage to do the same.
WOMAN 4:
She's lost more people than anyone.
Here she is being hostess.
WOMAN 5:

Hey, Sookie.
- Hey.
-You okay?
- I'm drunk.
-Oh, okay.
Well, you deserve to be.
Have you seen Arlene?
No, have--?
Have you seen Bill?
[MAN 1 SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
There's a safe house just on the other side of the bridge.
That's good people.
They'll give us food, shelter for the night.
Get our strength up so we can keep going north come morning.

-We've come this far and we almost--
[GUNSHOT]

Well, well, look who we have here.
You had no right to kill that man.
He was a good man.

I'm coming out.
Is it safe?
Yeah, it's safe, Sookie.
You don't look quite right.
Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
I'm just thinking is all.
-Well, then, stop.
The whole point of this celebration is so that we don't sit around here with long faces.
You haven't socialized at all tonight.
I know everyone's pleased to see you here.
No, they're pleased to see you, Sookie.
You've done well.
You've done more these last several days than I've managed to achieve in decades.
Mainstreaming.
- I didn't do this.
-Yeah, you did.
Well I've had a lovely evening.
SOOKIE:
You can't leave yet.
BILL:
No, I should be on my way.
But I had a wonderful time.
But I must admit, this concept of men and women being friends was a little bit foreign in my day.
- Bill?
-Yeah?
Thank you.
For what?
For seeing me the way I can't see myself sometimes.
Come on.
Good night, Bill.
Good night, Sookie.
WOMAN:
Look at her smiling like that, how she fights up the room.
LETTIE MAE:
Heard Willa was here.
Can't figure out what my Tara 's trying to tell me unless I get me some of Willa's blood.
Don't care if I have to stab her to get it.
Where's Willa?
- Hey.
Where's Willa?
-Who the fuck's Willa?
- Dance with me.
-No.
Willa?
Sugar, I've had a little too much to drink, so you're gonna just have to get to the point.
Okay, since Eric released me, I need a job, so I was wondering if maybe I could be a waitress--
-Lettie Mae, stop.
- Aah!
-What the fuck?
[GRUNTING]
- Get back!
Get the fuck back!
WILLA:
I'm okay.
- I'm okay.
SAM:
She's okay.
She's okay, y'all.
Put your fangs away.
LAFAYETTE:
What the hell's goings on here?
Lettie Mae stabbed Willa.
Of course she did.
What the fuck, Auntie?
Tara has been trying to contact me from the other side.
She's stuck.
And the only way I can find out what she needs is with Willa's blood.
- Come on, before you get killed.
Come on.
-You're all looking at me like I'm crazy.
Because I used to have a drinking problem, people don't believe me.
You stabbed somebody, Auntie.
That's why people think you crazy.
Come on.
You're all fucking crazy, if you ask me.
What the fuck are we doing here?
Huh?
When just three days ago a group of rabid vampires came and attacked the town and killed a bunch of people and kidnapped us, right?
Arlene, Jane, Holly and I, we were fucking chained in a dungeon and we--
Let's go to another room and talk about this.
- Oh, no, no, no.
No, Sam.
-Okay?
No.
I know you don't wanna hear this, but it needs to be said. lt's real.
Damn it, people are dead.
people are traumatized and the reaction you all have to this is to throw a party?
You fucking kidding me?
Now, I ain't for stabbing people, but at least Lettie Mae gets it.
Shit, I mean, you all are going on like this shit's normal, and it's not.
This shit doesn't happen in other towns.
- Take me home.
I wanna go home.
-Hey.
- I wanna go home.
-Hey, hey.
Here's your knife.
Thanks.
- Hey, I'm gonna make sure they get home safe.
-Thanks, Violet.
I don't know.
Maybe Lafayette is right.
- What about?
James and I.
Maybe we don't belong together.
You did meet in a prison camp, Jess.
Careful, Jason.
You know, people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
I see your point.
Yeah, Violet.
She's pretty weird, ain't she?
I mean, she's--
She's ancient and sexy as hell, but she's a little...
- Off?
-Yeah.
Ha, ha.
She's way the fuck off sometimes.
You think maybe that's why...?
No, why what?
We're supposed to be talking about you, Jess.
Yeah, I don't really feel like thinking about me anymore.
Go on.
- What?
-Well, okay, then.
It was like earlier tonight, when we were digging in trying to find Gran's ring to give it to Andy Violet was like, "I don't need a ring to prove to the world that you are mine."
All I kept thinking was, "Jesus, please.
Sweet baby Jesus put that ring on Holly's finger before it winds up on Violet's."
I mean, that was my Gran's ring, Jess.
It meant a lot that she wanted to give that to me.
Hell, man, I would've loved to have put it on someone one day.
But if that someone had to be Violet...
I don't know.
- Oh, Jason.
-What?
I think you might just be the sweetest man in the world.

What do Mommy and Daddy look like again?
Ah.

You think Daddy'd be enjoying himself this much if Sarah got to him first?

Mommy?

The whole world is looking for you.
What are you doing here?
Have you lost your ever-loving mind?
Oh, my God.
I missed you so much.
You look so pretty in that suit.
I forgot how beautiful you were.
What do you want?
And what have you done to your hair?
I'm in trouble.
Well, no shit, baby girl.
No, I mean real trouble.
And I need help from someone high up.
Someone powerful, right here, right now.
Is Laura Bush out there?
No, she is not.
Well, can you call her?
Sarah, Laura stopped taking my calls just about the time that that book came out claiming that my daughter is the monster who created the monsters who are scaring the shit out of half the country.
Now, is that true?
Yes.
But I'm not a monster.
I'm a Buddhist.
What?
Look, you have gotta get out of here.
If the liberal media finds out you are at this event, they are never gonna--
No, Mommy, stop.

What are you doing out here, my love?
Someday soon you'll be buried here too.
I don't want to fight.
But I don't see a way out.
Do you?
No.
I have loved you since the very first time I ever saw you.
Long back as I can remember.
You are my first and only true love.
And you are mine.
I will survive this war, Caroline.
And when it's all over I will come back to you and to the children.
I promise you.
I don't give a shit.
I am not going with you.
- I would rather die than get in that coffin.
- You will do what your maker tells you.
He may be my maker, but he sure as fuck didn't raise me.
Tara did.
She was the one who taught me how to feed how to control my impulses.
He left, and then you left her when we needed you most.
We have bigger problems than your mommy--
- She died because of you!
- Enough!
You're right.
I've been a terrible maker to you.
And for that I am truly sorry.
But I do not regret turning you and I am proud to call you my progeny.
Why did you come back for me?
Pam and I are gonna kill Sarah Newlin before I meet the true death.
You can count me out.
She was practically your stepmother, Willa.
If you have any idea where she might be I need to know it.
- I'm not going with you.
- Like fuck you aren't.
But I will tell you what I know if you release me.
Willa Burrell I renounce the ties of our blood and my dominion over you as my progeny.
As your maker I release you.
Like being kicked in the coach by a wallaby, isn't it?
Sarah has a sister.
Oh, no shit, Willa.
The whole world knows that.
- You'd better know more.
- Her name is Amber.
- Amber Mills.
- Mm.
And she's a vampire.
Oh...
Heh.
How the fuck could Sarah Newlin have a vampire sister and the world not know it?
I don't know, but I overheard her one night on the phone at the governor's mansion.
Sarah was warning her never to call there again or my father would send her to camp.
Any idea where this Amber lives?
The call came from a Dallas area code.
Good girl.
Ginger?
Tell the driver we're heading for Dallas.
And we'll only be needing two travel coffins.
What?
No.
You just got back.
And if you walk out that door, I ain't never gonna see you again, am I?
Take me with you.
Put me in the third coffin.
- Sorry.
- Wha--?
You're sorry?
I have been your sex slave for 15 years, Eric Northman and we ain't never had sex.
Blow job, hand job, nothing.
Do you know what a sex slave is without the sex?
A slave?
Now, you are taking me with you to Dallas.
And if you can't fucking take me then you had better fucking fuck me before you go.
Ginger, I'm diseased.
So the fuck am I.
No!
Sook?
Hey.
Hey.
I came as soon as I heard.
About Alcide?
About everything.
How is you holding up?
The house is so empty.
Well, that big man of yours did take up a lot of space.
- Sorry.
- No, I'm sorry, Sook.
I gotta clean up.
Jackson will be here in the morning--
- No, don't worry about that.
- No, what you need is some sleep.
When's the last time you got some shut-eye?
Let me put you to bed.
- Lafayette?
- Yes, ma'am?
Don't leave.
Sook, I will be here when you wake up.
So don't fret, okay?
Night-night.
What the hell?
Look who's up.
- Where's all his--?
- In the truck.
Uh...
When Alcide's mama died, the hardest part was going through all her things.
You just say when you wanna go through it all when you feel you're ready and Jenny and me will have you out to the place and we'll figure it all out.
Yeah, we'll figure it out.
Hey.
The undead has arisen.
- Hey, Sookie.
- How'd you sleep?
You wanna tell me why there's enough food to choke a horse on my dining room table?
Child, me and Jenny was busting our humps cooking all the livelong day.
Well, that's-
- That's real sweet but I can't eat all this.
There's enough food here to feed the whole town off of.
Well the whole town will be here.
- What?
- Uh-huh.
Wait, are--?
Are y'all throwing a party?
- Yeah.
Sookie, come on.
- In my house?
The day after--
I know what you're probably thinking, honey.
But death doesn't have to be such a sad thing.
Actually, it does.
Death is inherently sad.
I'm sad.
I'm not in the mood for a party.
Sook.
Sook.
Sook, what did you say last night when you came home?
About how this house was feeling so empty?
That's why we gonna fill it up.
So we can say "fuck you" to death and "hello" to life.
- Yeah.
- And that's what we doing.
We are motherfucking celebrating life.
I'm going back to sleep.
What would Tara want?
What would Alcide want?
Alcide would want people to be around you tonight.
Yes, ma'am, so take that pretty little ass of yours upstairs and get presentable.
Because folk gonna be here soon with some top-shelf alcohol and I got one restriction.
Not a nan person come up to you and say:
"Oh, I'm sorry for your loss." Mm-mm.
None of that bullshit.
- Hear, hear, I say.
- That's right.
Come on, hooker.
Let's bring out the vittles and bits.
- And that chicken Jenny made.
- It ain't as good as mine.
Sookie?
Oh.
This is not happening.
- Am I early?
- Why?
Do I not look ready?
Actually, best not answer that.
I only just now found out about the party I'm hosting tonight.
I see.
Um...
I didn't have any alcohol on hand, as requested.
My mother always taught me it was ungentlemanly to turn up to a gathering empty-handed so I brought you these.
Well, I guess I'd better go upstairs and put my face on but in the meantime, I invite you in.
Amber Mills?
Who are you?
I was always the black sheep of the family.
Started fangbanging right out of high school while Little Miss Perfect's marrying Steven Newlin.
- She's not here.
- Just like I told you she wasn't.
We had to be sure.
Your boyfriend?
Jeremy.
He was the one that turned me.
He helped me get my shit together.
But the second I turn, Sarah freaks.
She's married into the Fellowship of the Sun, after all.
But she knows I'm broke so she starts paying me off, a monthly cash delivery to stay in the coffin.
Then she goes out and she tells the world that her sister was taken by those evil vampires that I disappeared into thin air.
But I was here the whole time.
Jeremy and me sitting around watching House Hunters marathons and drinking Tru Blood.
What happened to Jeremy?
Same thing that's happening to us.
One day, he gets the veins.
A few months later, he's dying in my arms.
Sometimes I beat myself up over it.
If I hadn't taken her money, if I had come out--
She would have had you killed and kept on walking.
None of this is your fault.
It's your sister's which is why Pam and I are going after her.
And will you help us find her?
Are you gonna kill her?
There's a real good chance that's the way it's gonna go down.
Then you can count me in.
- Mm.
- I like her.
I like you.
Is it all right if I haven't made up my mind about you yet?
Yeah, I really like her.
When's the last time you saw Sarah?
Oh, it's been years now.
But she did call here this morning.
She said she just got to Dallas and she needed a place to hide.
I told her to fuck off.
She's in Dallas.
Any idea where else she might've gone?
Where she always goes, to Mommy and Daddy.
Even though she disgraced the family, they always fall for her BS.
And where do Mommy and Daddy live?
Why, Preston Hollow, of course.
But they won't be home tonight.
Probably already left for this.
The second I told her that's where Mommy and Daddy were going, she hung up.
- She'll be there.
- Looks like we're going to a gala.
You have a picture of your parents I can borrow?
You'll never get in.
You're vampires.
Security's gonna be tight and they only invited assholes.
You don't know us, sweetheart.
We can be assholes.
I wanna go.
I wanna say goodbye to my girl.
There's gonna be alcohol and vampires at Sookie's.
Know how you're always saying that eyes are the windows to the soul?
Lettie Mae, please.
Look into mine.
I ain't going to that party looking for no vamper blood.
I just wanna say goodbye because there won't be no grave in no cemetery where I can visit my Tara.
Ain't nothing left of her to bury.
I'm so sorry, sweetheart, but no.
No, no, I have to do what's best for you whether you like it or not.
Now, look, let me take care of you tonight.
Please.
All right?
All right.
Now, come on, give me a taste because I wanna make this just how you like it.
Come on.
Needs cumin.
Okay, all right, I'll...
- Hi.
- Hi, girl.
- Bring it in, honky.
- Hey.
Well, ladies, we dodged a bullet.
- Yeah, we did.
- Whoo!
Amazing what a little shut-eye can do to calm the nerves.
You know what, girls?
After what we all went through I'm gonna make some major changes in my life...
- ...clean up my act.
- That is great, Jane.
I'm gonna finally get my shit together.
- Amen.
- Good for you, girl.
Starting tomorrow.
I'm starting tomorrow too, okay?
- To not dying.
- Amen.
If anyone knows how to live it up, it's you, Jane Bodehouse.
Minus.
Mr. Compton.
I ain't seen you since your daddy died.
It's good to see you, Minus.
- What's going on?
Why's everyone going--?
- What's going on, William Compton is that Lincoln has called his soldiers.
Called his soldiers?
- Charles, are you saying-J?
- That's right, William, war.
Everyone's gonna enlist.
Based on our education and you and me being from prominent families we're guaranteed to be made commissioned officers.
Isn't that thrilling?
It is our God-given right to live our lives as we see fit without interference.
And I, for one, am willing to do whatever it takes to lay down my life, if necessary to preserve that God-given right.
Are we gonna let a bunch of Yankee cowards...
- Huh?
- No!
Then it is the sovereign right of the state of Louisiana to secede from the union!
Mr. Dupont's right.
Fort Sumter was just the beginning.
You see, we cannot, we must not let them destroy our way of life.
We have no choice but to fight.
With what?
This is a lost cause.
The Yankees have better artillery and more sophisticated weaponry than we do.
What they will destroy is our town.
Scorch our land and our livelihoods.
Get out of my bar, William Compton.
We got no room here for Yankee sympathizers.
I'm sorry if you find the truth offensive, Mr. Bodehouse.
Coward.
Get out.
To not dying.
Hey, Sook.
- You look real pretty.
- Thanks, so do you.
Yeah.
Yeah, I have to admit finally getting a chance to shower up makes all the difference.
I was talking to Violet.
- Oh.
- Tsk.
Oh, Sookie, my sister.
Oh, I know we're not supposed to say we're sorry for your loss but I am so very sorry.
I've had about a hundred boyfriends die on me over the years but I remember how painful those first ones were.
There you are, Sookie.
You look like you could do with something to eat.
I hear there are two kinds of chicken to try.
Excuse us.
What?
"I've had about a hundred boyfriends die on me, but I--"
Shut up and come dance with me.
Alcide could be an arrogant little shit even when he was a kid.
You'd tell him to go left, and he'd go right just to piss you off.
He'd question everything.
Now, fighting it's a way of life where we come from.
But Alcide, he wouldn't fight just for the sake of fighting.
In fact, he told me once, "I'll fight when I'm good and ready.
I'll fight when I have something worth fighting for."
You were worth it, Sookie.
Otherwise he wouldn't have fought for you.
My boy died a hero.
But you can't die a hero without having a righteous cause.
Thank you.
To Alcide.
- To Alcide.
- Alcide.
Excuse me.
Uh-uh.
No, Lettie Mae.
You can't come up in here causing no scene.
- Mm-mm.
- I am so sorry for your loss.
Lettie Mae.
You wanna say a few words about Tara?
First off, I'd like to say my heart goes out to you, Mr. Herveaux.
I'm sad for you but I'm also glad for you, because your son died a hero.
My Tara was a hero too.
Most of you know I made some big mistakes raising her.
Most of you know I didn't raise her.
That's because you did.
Her friends.
Still, though she sacrificed herself trying to save me even after all the pain I caused her.
And that's just beyond heroic in my book.
So I wanna ask you to join me in raising a glass to her.
You got anything non-alcoholic?
Yeah.
Here you go.
Thank you, deputy.
To my baby girl.
To Tara.
To Tara.
Thank you.
How's the party?
You should come inside.
I'm fine.
- Jessica--
- Andy.
I can't.
Did it ever occur to you that you torturing yourself over my girls keeps that pain alive for me too?
You ever think about that?
This has been a hell of a week we're having, but during it you have been there.
You have been good to Adilyn.
You helped bring Holly back to me and her boys.
I don't know if I'm supposed to be taking some message from all this bullshit that's been going on, but I'm taking one anyhow.
Life's too shun.
Jessica, it's too fucking precious to always be looking backwards.
I'm moving forwards.
But I'm gonna need your help to do that.
How can I help?
You got a ring I can borrow?
A ring, but--?
Oh, my God.
- Are you gonna propose to Holly tonight?
- Please don't make this...
- ...a bigger deal than it already is.
- Oh.
But it is a big deal.
I know that.
Jesus Christ, I'm freaking out inside.
Just give me a ring before I change my mind.
Andy, you can't propose to Holly with any of these.
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
I ain't exactly had time to go to the mall.
Come on.
Wait up.
Are you sure you don't mind me borrowing it, Sookie?
Not at all.
Gran would've loved Holly.
Although she did leave it to Jason to give to the woman he was gonna marry.
That's right, she did.
You're already mine, Jason.
I don't need a ring to tell me that.
Well, here it is.
Oh, my God.
It's beautiful.
That's it?
Holy crap, I'm really gonna do this, huh?
Andy you got yourself a real good woman, man.
It's all yours.
- You seen your mother?
- Uh, pretty sure she's in the living room.
Y'all are gonna wanna see this.
Oh, come here.
A little word to the wise.
I don't know if the two of you are fucking.
If you are it's gonna have to stop right now.
You got it?
What's up?
Andy?
Andy, what's wrong?
Could we kill the music, please?
On it.
Andy, oh, my God.
What are you doing?
Holly, I-
- I'm--
I don't know-
- I-
- I can't--
I don't know what I'm about to say but I have been waiting for the perfect moment to do this but something keeps getting in the way.
It wasn't until you went missing that I realized that something this whole time was me.
See, I got this voice in my head that says I don't deserve a woman as beautiful as you are.
I don't deserve a woman as kind as you are.
And I probably don't, but...
I know the timing's weird, and you got all kinds of healing to do...
- Oh.
- ...but, please wear this ring for me?
I'll go through all of it with you...
- ...every step of the way.
- Yes.
I didn't ask you yet.
You gotta let me ask you.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Jumped the gun.
Uh, Holly Cleary, I love you with everything I got.
Will you marry me?
That's lovely, man.
- I love you, Andy.
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Let's go congratulate them.
- Yeah.
- Hey.
- What?
What?
- You just seem happy is all.
- Well, I am.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Seriously?
Now?
Yeah, it's been a while since...
I know, but we're at a party.
Okay?
Don't be such a wet blanket.
Just try to have fun, and we'll leave later, okay?
Oh, man.
What a surprise.
You doing okay?
- Yeah.
- You fixing to cry?
I think I might be.
Come on, let's sneak upstairs.
Don't get me wrong, I am so happy for Andy and Holly.
It's just a little bit more of a celebration of life than I was ready for.
You miss him?
How can I miss someone I can't even believe is dead?
Alcide dying's a bit of a shock, sweetie.
That's the thing.
It never occurred to me that Alcide could die.
He's just so big and strong, and he just--
It don't matter how big or strong someone is if someone else has a gun.
It was the same way with Terry.
It happened so fast, came out of nowhere.
The thing is, though when it comes to loving a man and then losing him it doesn't matter how it happens, because he's still gone.
You still have that hole inside you, and it hurts just the same no matter how prepared you are for it or not.
Oh.
When Terry died, I thought I was gonna die right along with him.
How did you get through it?
At night, when no one was looking sometimes I'd put his jacket on just so I could feel his arms around me again.
You never get over the loss of someone you love.
You just learn to live with it.
And nothing's gonna help heal this pain you're feeling but time.
And tequila.
How about a little tequila?
There's not enough tequila in the world to get me through tonight.
"Wet blanket"?
Do she even know who you is?
- She gives me just enough love.
- Mm.
And just enough affection to keep me hooked.
That's just like paying the minimum on your credit card bill each month just to keep that fucker from getting canceled.
That's exactly what it's like.
- Mm.
- Jesus Christ, am I that fucking simple?
No, sir.
There's nothing simple about you at all.
The night we met remember that story you told me about how you was turned?
- Mm-hm.
- Can I ask a follow-up question?
Of course.
Danny Monoghan.
What about him?
Was y'all...?
Yeah.
I told the saleswoman my wife and I were going to an exclusive high-society event and that only the very best would do.
Voila'.
Oh, my God.
I'm a Republi-cunt.
- You think that's funny, huh?
- Mm-hm.
Wait till you see what that nice man at Neiman's and I picked out for you.
Strip.
Oh, fuck, Eric.
You're stage two.
Just cover the ones that will be visible.
Okay.
I'm gonna die, Pam.
You have to accept that.
Whoo!
- My God, there he is.
- There who is?
That vampire who gave me his blood.
He's been making eyes at me ever since he got here.
Evening, Arlene.
Heh.
Hey, Keith.
Um, Arlene here is super grateful on account of you, you know saving her life last night and all, but she's been through a lot, so you might wanna...
- ...
I don't know, dial down your sexy a notch.
- Heh.
I understand.
And I can wait.
Sookie, would you please tell your friend that I think she's the most beautiful woman I've seen in over 300 years?
And I'll see her in her dreams.
Um...
I have to go make tinkle because, you know, I am a human.
Arlene, have you seen James?
- Huh?
- James.
Have you seen him?
I've been looking everywhere.
I think I saw him step outside with Lafayette a little while ago.
Thanks.
You incredible asshole!
- Get out of here.
- I am so sorry.
Really, James?
That's what you have to say?
That you are sorry?
Need I remind you that I just found you fucking a man in our car?
Jessica, please--
Get the fuck out of my way.
Will you come outside and talk to me?
- Jason?
- Yeah, what's going on?
- Can we please talk?
- There is nothing to say.
Would you rescind his invitation to this house?
- What'd he do?
What did you do?
- I found him fucking Lafayette in the car that he and I bought together.
Get the fuck out of here, James.
- I should probably--
- Yeah, okay.
Go.
You all right?
Look.
I just wanna be alone right now.
Okay.
In case you need a place to crash, you know where I live.
You mean with all that--
That sensitive musician shit, it never occurred to you that he might be gay?
I don't think that he is gay.
I think that he-
- He's just--
- He's confused.
- Jess, I gotta be honest with you.
Based on what you saw him doing outside...
- ...it all sounds pretty gay to me.
- Oh, my God.
- Who is it?
- It's me.
Go away.
- Whoa.
- Look, Red, I know this shit got to hurt--
Don't you dare presume to know me.
You do not know the first thing about me.
And you don't know the first thing about him.
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you.
You know what?
When was he turned?
How was he turned?
Who turned him?
And where's he from back before he got turned?
Ms. Ma'am, you don't know any of this shit, do you?
I do because I cared enough to ask him, and he cared enough to tell me.
Now, listen, I know the way this shit went down is real embarrassing.
But if you keep it 100 with yourself and honest you know this is not the man for you.
- He's the man for you?
- If he is what's so fucking unimaginable about that, Red?
Huh?
Everybody else in this town is falling in love and getting engaged and having babies.
Has it ever occurred to you that Lafayette, that queen that make all you white heterosexuals laugh and feel good about yourselves...
Has it fucking ever occurred to you that maybe I want a piece of happiness too?
No.
James is a good man.
He's a vampire, Lafayette.
Whatever he is.
If you don't love him, let him go.
And I will take over from here.
I was wrong about that Sookie Stackhouse.
It wasn't her fault.
Hep-vamps were taking out town after town.
- I feel bad about the things I said.
- Her guy gave his life for her.
Lost the man she loved trying to save our town.
So pretty.
I wonder if I'd have the courage to do the same.
She's lost more people than anyone.
Here she is being hostess.
Seh's got a heart bigger than all of Louisiana.
Hey, Sookie.
- Hey.
- You okay?
- I'm drunk.
- Oh, okay.
Well, you deserve to be.
Have you seen Arlene?
No, have--?
Have you seen Bill?
There's a safe house just on the other side of the bridge.
That's good people.
They'll give us food, shelter for the night.
Get our strength up so we can keep going north come morning.
Shh.
Get down.
Everybody down.
- Keep going!
- All right, come on.
Okay, they're gone.
We're safe.
- You scared?
- Yeah, I suppose I am.
All right, folks, it's gonna be all right.
We gots to keep moving, though.
- Let's go.
- We've come this far and we almost--
Well, well, look who we have here.
You had no right to kill that man.
He was a good man.
- You had no goddamn right.
- Oh, actually, I do.
Now, if you would kindly hand over that map.
Do it!
Hey.
Hey!
- No!
No!
No!
- Get out of the way, Caroline!
Please, Charles, I beg of you.
Please think of the children.
You let that man serve as a warning of what we do to any and all deserters no matter what their color.
Hyah!
Bill?
I'm coming out.
Is it safe?
Yeah, it's safe, Sookie.
You don't look quite right.
Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
I'm just thinking is all.
- Well, then, stop.
The whole point of this celebration is so that we don't sit around here with long faces.
You haven't socialized at all tonight.
I know everyone's pleased to see you here.
No, they're pleased to see you, Sookie.
You've done well.
You've done more these last several days than I've managed to achieve in decades.
Mainstreaming.
- I didn't do this.
- Yeah, you did.
Well I've had a lovely evening.
You can't leave yet.
No, I should be on my way.
But I had a wonderful time.
But I must admit, this concept of men and women being friends was a little bit foreign in my day.
- Bill?
- Yeah?
Thank you.
For what?
For seeing me the way I can't see myself sometimes.
Come on.
Good night, Bill.
Good night, Sookie.
Look at her smiling like that, how she fights up the room.
Heard Willa was here.
Can't figure out what my Tara 's trying to tell me unless I get me some of Willa's blood.
Don't care if I have to stab her to get it.
Where's Willa?
- Hey.
Where's Willa?
- Who the fuck's Willa?
- Dance with me.
- No.
Willa?
Sugar, I've had a little too much to drink, so you're gonna just have to get to the point.
Okay, since Eric released me, I need a job, so I was wondering if maybe...
- ...
I could be a waitress--
- Lettie Mae, stop.
- Aah!
- What the fuck?
- Get back!
Get the fuck back!
- I'm okay.
- I'm okay.
- She's okay.
She's okay, y'all.
Put your fangs away.
What the hell's goings on here?
Lettie Mae stabbed Willa.
Of course she did.
What the fuck, Auntie?
Tara has been trying to contact me from the other side.
She's stuck.
And the only way I can find out what she needs is with Willa's blood.
- Come on, before you get killed.
Come on.
- You're all looking at me like I'm crazy.
Because I used to have a drinking problem, people don't believe me.
You stabbed somebody, Auntie.
That's why people think you crazy.
Come on.
You're all fucking crazy, if you ask me.
What the fuck are we doing here?
Huh?
When just three days ago a group of rabid vampires came and attacked the town and killed a bunch of people and kidnapped us, right?
Arlene, Jane, Holly and I, we were fucking chained in a dungeon and we--
Let's go to another room and talk about this.
- Oh, no, no, no.
No, Sam.
- Okay?
No.
I know you don't wanna hear this, but it needs to be said. lt's real.
Damn it, people are dead.
people are traumatized and the reaction you all have to this is to throw a party?
You fucking kidding me?
Now, I ain't for stabbing people, but at least Lettie Mae gets it.
Shit, I mean, you all are going on like this shit's normal, and it's not.
This shit doesn't happen in other towns.
- Take me home.
I wanna go home.
- Hey.
- I wanna go home.
- Hey, hey.
Here's your knife.
Thanks.
- Hey, I'm gonna make sure they get home safe.
- Thanks, Violet.
I don't know.
Maybe Lafayette is right.
- What about?
James and I.
Maybe we don't belong together.
You did meet in a prison camp, Jess.
Careful, Jason.
You know, people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
I see your point.
Yeah, Violet.
She's pretty weird, ain't she?
I mean, she's--
She's ancient and sexy as hell, but she's a little...
- Off?
- Yeah.
Ha, ha.
She's way the fuck off sometimes.
You think maybe that's why...?
No, why what?
We're supposed to be talking about you, Jess.
Yeah, I don't really feel like thinking about me anymore.
Go on.
- What?
- Well, okay, then.
It was like earlier tonight, when we were digging in trying to find Gran's ring to give it to Andy Violet was like, "I don't need a ring to prove to the world that you are mine."
All I kept thinking was, "Jesus, please.
Sweet baby Jesus put that ring on Holly's finger before it winds up on Violet's."
I mean, that was my Gran's ring, Jess.
It meant a lot that she wanted to give that to me.
Hell, man, I would've loved to have put it on someone one day.
But if that someone had to be Violet...
I don't know.
- Oh, Jason.
- What?
I think you might just be the sweetest man in the world.
Of all the horrible things I've seen in the last 100 years...
- ...this could be the most disturbing.
- Yeah.
Oh, come on.
It's fun because we're together.
No, it isn't.
What do Mommy and Daddy look like again?
Ah.
Someone's having a good time.
You think Daddy'd be enjoying himself this much if Sarah got to him first?
I'll get him alone.
You mingle, find the mother.
How?
All these bitches look the same.
Mommy?
- Oh, my God.
- Hi, Mommy.
Sarah, what in he--?
The whole world is looking for you.
What are you doing here?
Have you lost your ever-loving mind?
Oh, my God.
I missed you so much.
You look so pretty in that suit.
I forgot how beautiful you were.
What do you want?
And what have you done to your hair?
I'm in trouble.
Well, no shit, baby girl.
No, I mean real trouble.
And I need help from someone high up.
Someone powerful, right here, right now.
Is Laura Bush out there?
No, she is not.
Well, can you call her?
Sarah, Laura stopped taking my calls just about the time that that book came out claiming that my daughter is the monster who created the monsters who are scaring the shit out of half the country.
Now, is that true?
Yes.
But I'm not a monster.
I'm a Buddhist.
What?
Look, you have gotta get out of here.
If the liberal media finds out you are at this event, they are never gonna--
No, Mommy, stop.
Listen very closely.
The yakuza are after me.
Oh, darling.
Paul?
I need to ask you some questions about your daughter.
Has she come to see you?
The yakuza?
Go, move!
Get out!
- Where is your daughter?
- I don't know.
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
- Come on!
- Go on, baby!
What are you doing out here, my love?
Someday soon you'll be buried here too.
I don't want to fight.
But I don't see a way out.
Do you?
No.
I have loved you since the very first time I ever saw you.
Long back as I can remember.
You are my first and only true love.
And you are mine.
I will survive this war, Caroline.
And when it's all over I will come back to you and to the children.
I promise you.
( Ginger gasping )
I don't give a shit!
I am not going with you.
I would rather die than get in that coffin!
You will do what your maker tells you to do.
He may be my maker, but he sure as fuck didn't raise me.
Tara did.
She was the one who taught me how to feed, how to control my impulses.
He left, and then you left her when we needed you most.
We have bigger fucking problems than your mommy and your daddy--
- She died because of you!
- I am sorry--
Enough!
( sighs )
You're right.
I've been a terrible maker to you.
And for that I am truly sorry.
But I do not regret turning you, and I'm proud to call you my progeny.
Why did you come back for me?
Pam and I are gonna kill Sarah Newlin before I meet the true death.
You can count me out.
She was practically your stepmother, Willa.
If you have any idea where she might be,
I need to know it.
- I'm not going with you.
- Like fuck you aren't.
But I will tell you what I know if you release me.
Willa Burrell,
I renounce the ties of our blood and my dominion over you as my progeny.
As your maker...
- I release you.
- ( gasps )
Like being kicked in the cooch by a wallaby, isn't it?
Sarah has a sister.
Oh, no shit, Willa.
The whole world knows that.
- You'd better know more.
- Her name is Amber.
Amber Mills.
And she's a vampire.
Oh.
How the fuck could Sarah Newlin have a vampire sister and the world not know about it?
I don't know, but I overheard her one night on the phone at the governor's mansion.
Sarah was warning her never to call there again or my father would send her to camp.
Any idea where this Amber lives?
The call came from a Dallas area code.
Good girl.
- Ginger?
- ( gasps )
Tell the driver we're heading for Dallas.
And we'll only be needing two travel coffins.
What?
No!
You just got back.
And if you walk out that door,
I ain't never gonna see you again, am I?
Take me with you.
Put me in the third coffin.
- Sorry.
- What-- you're sorry?
I have been your sex slave for 15 years, Eric Northman, and we ain't never had sex.
Blow job, hand job, nothing.
Do you know what a sex slave is without the sex?
A slave?
Now, you are taking me with you to Dallas.
And if you can't fucking take me, then you had better fuckin' fuck me before you go.
Ginger, I'm diseased.
So the fuck am I!
( wailing )
No!

Sook?
Hey.
Hey.
I came as soon as I heard.
Ab-- about Alcide?
About everything.
How is you holding up?
( voice breaking ) The house is so empty.
Well, that big man of yours did take up a lot of space.
- Sorry.
- No, I'm sorry, Sook.
I gotta clean up.
- Jackson will be here in the morning.
- No, don't worry about that.
- We'll take care of this.
- No, what you need is some sleep.
When's the last time you got some serious shut-eye?
Come on, let me put you to bed.
Lafayette?
Yes, ma'am?
Don't leave.
Sook, I will be here when you wake up.
So don't fret, 'kay?
Night-night.
( distant clanking )
( thuds )
( objects clattering )
What the hell?
( door opens, closes )
Look who's up.
- Where's all his--
- In the truck.
When Alcide's mama died, the hardest part was going through all her things.
You just say when you wanna go through it all, when you feel you're ready, and Jenny and me will have you out to the place and we'll figure it all out.
Yeah, we'll figure it out.
- ( laughter )
- Hey!
The undead has arisen.
- Hey, there, Sookie.
- How'd you sleep?
Lafayette, you wanna tell me why there's enough food to choke a horse on my dining room table?
Child, me and Jenny was bustin' our humps cooking' all the livelong day.
Well, that's-- that's real sweet, but I can't eat all this.
There's enough food here to feed the whole town off of.
Well... the whole town will be here.
( laughs )
- What?
- Uh-huh.
Wait, are-- are y'all throwing a party?
- All:
Yeah!
- Sookie, come on.
In my house?
The day after--
I know what you're probably thinking, honey.
But death doesn't have to be such a sad thing.
Actually, it does.
Death is inherently sad.
I'm sad.
I'm not in the mood for a party.
Sook.
Sook!
Sook, what did you say last night when you came home?
About how this house was feeling so empty?
That's why we're gonna fill it up, so we can say "fuck you," to death and "hello," to life.
- Jenny:
Yeah.
- And that's what we're doing.
We are motherfucking celebrating life.
I'm going back to sleep.
What would Tara want?
What would Alcide want?
Alcide would want people to be around you tonight, Sookie.
Yes, ma'am, so take that pretty little ass of yours upstairs and get presentable.
'Cause folk gonna be here soon with some top-shelf alcohol, and I got one restriction-- not a nan person come up to you and say, "Oh, I'm sorry for your loss."
Mm-mm, none of that bullshit.
- Hear, hear, I say.
- James:
That's right.
Come on, hooker.
Let's bring out the rest of the vittles and bits.
James:
And that chicken Jenny made.
- Lafayette:
It ain't as good as mine.
- ( knock on door )
Bill:
Sookie?
Ugh, this is not happening.
- Am I early?
- Why, do I not look ready?
You know what, actually, best not answer that.
I only just now found out about the party I'm hosting tonight.
I see.
Um...
I didn't have any alcohol on hand, as requested.
My mother always taught me it was ungentlemanly to turn up to a gathering empty-handed, so, uh, I brought you these.
Well, I guess I'd better go upstairs and put my face on, but in the meantime, I invite you in.
( rings doorbell )
Amber Mills?
Who are you?
I was always the black sheep of the family.
Started fangbanging right outta high school while Little Miss Perfect's marrying Steven Newlin.
- ( doors closing )
- She's not here.
Just like I told you she wasn't.
We had to be sure.
Your boyfriend?
Jeremy.
He was the one that turned me.
He helped me get my shit together.
But the second I turn, Sarah freaks.
She's married into the Fellowship of the Sun, after all.
But she knows I'm broke, so she starts paying me off, a monthly cash delivery to stay in the coffin.
Then she goes out and she tells the world that her sister was taken from her by those evil vampires, that I disappeared into thin air.
But I was here the whole time.
Jeremy and me sittin' around watching "House Hunters" marathons and drinkin' Tru Blood.
What happened to Jeremy?
Same thing that's happening to us.
One day, he gets the veins.
A few months later, he's dying in my arms.
Sometimes I beat myself up over it.
I mean, if I hadn't taken her money, if I had come out instead of hiding--
She would've had you killed and kept on walking.
None of this is your fault.
It's your sister's, which is why Pam and I are going after her.
And will you help us find her?
Are you gonna kill her?
There's a real good chance that's the way it's gonna go down.
Then you can count me in.
Mm.
I like her.
I like you.
Is it all right if I haven't made up my mind about you yet?
Yeah, I really like her.
When's the last time you saw Sarah?
Oh, it's been years now.
But she did call here this morning.
She said she just got to Dallas and she needed a place to hide.
I told her to fuck off.
She's in Dallas.
Any idea where else she might've gone?
Where she always goes, to Mommy and Daddy.
Even though she disgraced the family, they always fall for her BS.
And where do Mommy and Daddy live?
Why, Preston Hollow, of course.
But they won't be home tonight.
Probably already left for this.
The second I told her that's where Mommy and Daddy were going, she hung up.
She'll be there.
Looks like we're going to a gala.
Do you have a picture of your parents I can borrow?
You'll never get in.
You're vampires.
Security's gonna be tight and they only invited assholes.
You don't know us, sweetheart.
We can be assholes.
I want to go.
I want to say good-bye to my girl.
But there's gonna be alcohol and vampires at Sookie's.
Know how you're always saying that eyes are the windows to the soul?
Lettie Mae, please.
Look into mine.
I ain't going to that party looking for no vamper blood.
I just want to say good-bye 'cause there won't be no grave in no cemetery where I can visit my Tara.
Ain't nothing left of her to bury.
I'm so sorry, sweetheart, but no.
No, no, I have to do what's best for you whether you like it or not.
Now, look, let me take care of you tonight.
Please.
All right?
All right.
Now, come on, give me a taste, 'cause I wanna make this just how you like it.
- Come on.
- ( blows )
Needs cumin.
Okay, all right, I'll...

Well, ladies, we dodged a bullet!
- Yeah, we did.
- Whoo!
Amazing what a little shut-eye can do to calm the nerves.
- Jane:
You know what, girls?
- Hmm?
After what we all went through,
I'm gonna make some major changes in my life,
- clean up my act.
- That is great, Jane.
I'm gonna finally get my shit together.
- Good for you, girl.
- Holly:
Amen.
Yeah.
- Starting tomorrow.
- ( all laughing )
I'm starting tomorrow, too, okay?
( laughing )
- To not dyin'.
- Amen.
Arlene:
If anyone knows how to live it up, it's you, Jane Bodehouse.
( horse neighs )
Minus.
Mr. Compton.
I ain't seen you since your daddy died.
It's good to see you, Minus.
What's going on?
Why's everyone goin'--
What's going on, William Compton... ( snaps ) is that Lincoln has called his soldiers.
Called his soldiers?
Charles, are you saying--
That's right, William, war.
Everyone's going to enlist.
Based on our education and you and me being from prominent families, we're all but guaranteed to be made commissioned officers.
Isn't that thrilling'?
( laughs )
( men shouting )
It is our God-given right to live our lives as we see fit,
- without interference.
- Crowd:
Yeah!
Charles:
And I, for one, am willing to do whatever it takes to lay down my life if necessary to preserve that God-given right.
Are we gonna let a bunch of Yankee cowards come on down here and take our freedoms?
- Huh?
- Crowd:
No!
Then it is the sovereign right of the state of Louisiana to secede from the union.
( crowd cheers )
Mr. DuPont's right.
Fort Sumter was just the beginning.
Crowd:
Yeah!
You see, we cannot, we must not let them destroy our way of life.
We have no choice but to fight.
Crowd:
Yeah!
With what?
( crowd murmuring )
This is a lost cause.
The Yankees have better artillery.
More sophisticated weaponry than we do.
What they will destroy is our town, scorch our land, our livelihoods.
Get outta my bar, William Compton.
We got no room here for Yankee sympathizers.
I'm sorry if you find the truth offensive, Mr. Bodehouse.
- Man:
Get out!
Go ahead!
- ( men shouting )
- ( music playing ) - ( partygoers laughing )
Holly:
To not dyin'.
Hey, Sook.
You look real pretty.
Thanks, so do you.
Yeah, yeah, I have to admit finally getting a chance to shower up makes all the difference.
I was talking to Violet.
Oh.
Tsk.
Oh, Sookie, my sister.
Oh, I know we're not supposed to say we're sorry for your loss, but I am so very sorry.
I've had about a hundred boyfriends die on me over the years, but I remember how painful those first ones were.
There you are, Sookie.
You look like you could do with something eat.
I hear there are two kinds of chicken to try.
Excuse us.
What?
"I've had about a hundred boyfriends die on me, but I--"
Shut up and come dance with me.
♪ Don't be afraid, I'll show you tonight... ♪
( TV playing in background )
( snoring softly )
Alcide could be an arrogant little shit, even when he was a kid.
You'd tell him to go left and he'd go right just to piss you off.
He'd question everything.
Now, fightin', it's a way of life where we come from, but Alcide, he wouldn't fight just for the sake of fighting'.
In fact, he told me once, "I'll fight when I'm good and ready.
I'll fight when I have something worth fighting for."
You were worth it, Sookie.
Otherwise he wouldn't have fought for you.
My boy died a hero.
But you can't die a hero without having a righteous cause.
Thank you.
To Alcide.
Others:
To Alcide.
- To Alcide.
- Alcide.
Lettie Mae:
'Scuse me.
Uh-uh, no, Lettie Mae.
You can't come up in here causing no scene.
- Mm-mm.
- I am so sorry for your loss.
Lettie Mae.
You wanna say a few words about Tara?
( heavy sigh )
First off, I'd like to say my heart goes out to you, Mr. Herveaux.
I'm sad for you, but I'm also glad for you because your son died a hero.
My Tara was a hero, too.
Most of you know I made some big mistakes raising her.
Most of you know I didn't raise her, that's 'cause you did-- her friends.
Still, though, she sacrificed herself trying to save me, even after all the pain I caused her.
And that's just beyond heroic in my book.
So I want to ask you to join me in raising a glass to her.
You got anything non-alcoholic?
Yeah.
Here you go.
Thank you, Deputy.
To my baby girl.
- To Tara.
- Others:
To Tara.
( mouths ) Thank you.
How's the party?
You should come inside.
I'm fine.
- Jessica--
- Andy.
I can't.
Did it ever occur to you that you torturing yourself over my girls keeps that pain alive for me, too?
You ever think about that?
This has been a hell of a week we're having, but during it you have been there.
You have been good to Adilyn.
You helped bring Holly back to me and her boys.
I don't know if I'm supposed to be taking some kind of message from all this bullshit that's been going on, but I'm taking one anyhow.
Life's too short.
Jessica, it's too fucking precious to always be looking backwards.
I'm moving forwards.
But I'm gonna need your help to do that.
How can I help?
( takes deep breath )
You got a ring I can borrow?
A ring, but-- oh, my God.
Are you gonna propose to Holly tonight?
Please don't make this a bigger deal than it already is.
But it is a big deal.
I know that!
Jesus Christ, I'm freakin' out inside.
Just give me a ring before I change my mind.
Andy, you can't propose to Holly with any of these.
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
I ain't exactly had time to go to the mall.
Come on.
Wait up!
Are you sure you don't mind me borrowing it, Sookie?
Not at all.
Gran would've loved Holly.
Although she did leave it to Jason to give to the woman he was gonna marry.
That's right, she did.
You're already mine, Jason.
I don't need a ring to tell me that.
Well, here it is.
Jessica:
Oh, my God.
It's beautiful.
That's it?
Holy crap, I'm really gonna do this, huh?
( Jessica laughs )
Andy, you got yourself a real good woman, man.
It's all yours.
( music playing )
You seen your mother?
Uh, pretty sure she's in the living room.
Y'all are gonna wanna see this.
Oh, come here.
A little word to the wise.
I don't know if the two of you are fuckin' or not, but if you are, it's gonna have to stop right now.
You got it?
What's up?
( laughing )
( Holly laughing )
Oh, you're bad.
Andy?
Andy, what's wrong?
Could we kill the music, please?
- On it.
- ( music stops )
Andy, oh, my God.
What are you doing?
Holly, I-
- I'm-- I don't know--
I-
- I can't-- ( sighs )
I don't know what I'm about to say, but I have been waiting for the perfect moment to do this, but something keeps getting in the way.
It wasn't until you went missing that I realized that something this whole time, was me.
See, I got this voice in my head that says I don't deserve a woman as beautiful as you are.
I don't deserve a woman as kind as you are.
And I probably don't, but...
I know the timing's weird and you got all kinds of healing to do.
- Oh.
- But, please... wear this ring for me?
I'll go through all of it with ya every step of the way.
Yes!
Crowd:
Aw!
I didn't ask you yet.
You gotta let me ask you.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- Sorry.
- ( laughter )
Jumped the gun.
Uh, Holly Cleary, I love you with everything I got.
Will you marry me?
( applause, cheering )
- ( ululating ) - ( cheering )
Jason:
That's lovely, man.
I love you, Andy!
Let's go congratulate 'em.
Yeah.
- Hey.
- What?
What?
- You just seem happy is all.
- Well, I am.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Seriously?
Now?
Yeah, it's been a while since...
I know, but we're at-- we're at a party.
Okay?
Don't be such a wet blanket.
Just try to have fun and we'll leave later, okay?
Oh, man, what a surprise.
You doing okay?
Yeah.
You fixing' to cry?
I think I might be.
Come on, let's sneak upstairs.
Don't get me wrong, I am so happy for Andy and Holly.
It's just a little bit more of a celebration of life than I was ready for.
You miss him?
How can I miss someone I can't even believe is dead?
Arlene:
Alcide dying's a bit of a shock, sweetie.
Sookie:
That's the thing.
It never occurred to me that Alcide could die.
He's just... so-- so big and strong and he just--
It don't matter how big or strong someone is if someone else has a gun.
It was the same way with Terry.
It happened so fast, came out of nowhere.
The thing is, though, when it comes to loving a man and then losing him, it doesn't matter how it happens 'cause he's still gone.
You still have that hole inside you and it hurts just the same no matter how prepared you are for it or not.
( sighs ) When Terry died,
I thought I was gonna die right along with him.
How did you get through it?
At night, when no one was lookin'... sometimes I'd put his jacket on just so I could feel his arms around me again.
( laughs )
You never get over the loss of someone you love.
You just learn to live with it.
And nothing's gonna help heal this pain you're feeling but time.
And tequila.
( both laughing )
How about a little tequila?
Sookie:
There's not enough tequila in the world to get me through tonight.
"Wet blanket"?
Do she even know who you is?
She gives me just enough love.
Mm.
And just enough affection to keep me hooked.
That's just like paying the minimum on your credit card bill each month just to keep that fucker from getting cancelled.
That's exactly what it's like.
Mm.
Jesus Christ, am I that fucking simple?
No, sir.
There's nothing simple about you at all.
The night we met, remember that story you told me about how you was turned?
Mm-hmm.
Can I ask a follow-up question?
Of course.
Danny Monoghan.
What about him?
Was y'all...
Yeah.
I told the sales woman my wife and I were going to an exclusive high society event and that only the very best would do.
Voilà.
Pam:
Oh, my God.
I'm a republi-cunt.
( laughs )
- You think that's funny, huh?
- Mm-hmm.
Wait till you see what that nice man at Neiman's and I picked out for you.
Strip.
Oh, fuck, Eric.
You're stage two.
Just cover the ones that will be visible.
Okay.
I'm gonna die, Pam.
You have to accept that.
( sniffles )
- ( music playing ) - ( whooping )
Whoo!
( gasps )
- My God, there he is.
- There who is?
That vampire who gave me his blood.
He's been making eyes at me ever since he got here.
- Evening, Arlene.
- ( Sookie laughs ) Hey, Keith.
Um, Arlene here is super grateful on account of you, you know, saving her life last night and all, but she's been through a lot, so you might wanna,
I don't know, dial down your sexy a notch.
( laughs )
I understand.
And I can wait.
Sookie, would you please tell your friend Arlene here that I think she's the most beautiful woman I've seen in over 300 years?
( whispers ) And I'll see her in her dreams.
Um...
I have to go make tinkle because, you know, I am a human.
Arlene, have you seen James?
Huh?
James-- have you seen him?
I've been looking everywhere.
I think I saw him step outside with Lafayette a little while ago.
Thanks.
( moaning, panting )
You incredible asshole!
- Get out of here.
- I am so sorry.
Really, James?
That's what you have to say?
That you are sorry?
Because need I remind you that I just found you fucking a man in our car.
- Jessica, please.
- Get the fuck out of my way.
Jess, will you please come outside and talk to me?
- Jason?
- Yeah, what's going on?
- Jessica, can we please talk about this?
- There is nothing to say.
Would you please rescind his invitation to this house?
What did he do?
What did you do?
I found him fucking Lafayette in the car that he and I bought together.
Get the fuck outta here, James.
( door slams )
- I should probably--
- Yeah, okay.
Go.
You all right?
Look, I just want to be alone right now.
Okay.
In case you need a place to crash, you know where I live.
( sighs )
You mean, with all that-- that sensitive musician shit, it never occurred to you that he might be gay?
I don't think that he is gay.
I think that he-- he's confused.
Jess, I gotta be honest with you.
Based on what you're telling me you saw him doing outside, it all sounds pretty gay to me.
- Oh, my God.
- ( knock on door )
- Who is it?
- Lafayette:
It's me.
Go away!
Look, Red, I know this shit got to hurt--
Don't you dare presume to know me.
You do not know the first thing about me.
And you don't know the first thing about him.
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you.
You know what?
When was he turned?
How was he turned?
Who turned him?
And where's he from back before he got turned?
Miss ma'am, you don't know any of this shit, do you?
I do because I cared enough to ask him and he cared enough to tell me.
Now, listen, I--
I know the way this shit went down is real embarrassing.
But if you keep it 100 with yourself and honest, then you know this is not the man for you.
Because he's the man for you?
If he is, what's so fucking unimaginable about that, Red?
Huh?
Everybody else in this fucking town is falling in love and getting engaged and having babies.
Has it ever fucking occurred to you that Lafayette, that queen that make all you white heterosexuals laugh and feel good about yourselves, has it fucking ever occurred to you that maybe I want a piece of happiness, too?
No.
( sighs )
James is a good man.
He's a vampire, Lafayette.
Whatever he is.
If you don't love him, let him go.
And I will take over from here.
- ( overlapping thoughts )
- I was wrong about that Sookie Stackhouse.
It wasn't her fault all this happened.
Hep-vamps were taking out town after town.
I feel so bad about all the things I said about her.
Her guy gave his life for her.
Lost the man she loved trying to save our town.
So pretty.
I wonder if I'd have the courage to do the same for the woman I love.
She's lost more people than anyone.
Here she is being hostess.
She's got a heart bigger than all of Louisiana.
- Willa:
Hey, Sookie.
- Hey.
You okay?
I'm drunk.
Oh, okay.
Well, you deserve to be.
Have you seen Arlene?
No, have-- have you seen Bill?
There's a safe house just on the other side of the bridge.
That's good people.
They'll give us food, shelter for the night... get our strength up... so we can keep going north come mornin'.
( horse neighs )
Shh, get down.
Everybody down.
- Man:
Keep going!
- Man #2:
All right, come on.
( baby crying )
- Shh, shh, shh.
- ( crying continues )
Okay, they're gone.
We're safe.
You scared?
Yeah, I suppose I am.
All right, folks, it's gonna be all right.
We gots to keep moving, though.
- Man:
Let's go.
- We've come this far and we're almost- ( gunshot ) - ( horses neigh )
( baby crying )
Well, well, look who we have here.
You had no right to kill that man.
He was a good man.
- You had no goddamn right.
- Oh, actually, I do.
Now, if you would kindly hand over that map.
Do it!
( baby continues crying )
Hey.
Hey!
- ( hammer clicks )
- No!
- No!
No!
- Get out of the way, Caroline!
Please, Charles, I beg of you!
Please think of the children!
( groans )
- ( yells ) - ( rifle fires )
You let that man serve as a warning of what we do to any and all deserters, no matter what their color.
Hyah!
( continues crying )
Bill?
I'm coming out.
Is it safe?
Yeah, it's safe, Sookie.
You don't look quite right.
Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
I'm just thinkin' is all.
- Well, then, stop.
The whole point of this celebration is so that we don't sit around here with long faces.
( chuckles )
You haven't socialized at all tonight.
I know everyone's pleased to see you here.
No, they're pleased to see you, Sookie.
You've done well.
You've done more these last several days than I've managed to achieve in decades.
Mainstream.
- ( music playing ) - ( chatter )
- I didn't do this.
- Yeah, you did.
Well...
I've had a lovely evening.
You can't leave yet.
No, I should be on my way.
But I had a wonderful time.
But I must admit this concept of men and women being friends was a little bit foreign in my day.
- Bill?
- Yeah?
Thank you.
For what?
For seeing me the way I can't see myself sometimes.
Come on.
Good night, Bill.
Good night, Sookie.
Woman thinking:
Look at her smilin' like that, how she lights up the room.
Lettie Mae thinking:
Heard Willa was here.
Can't figure out what my Tara's trying to tell me unless I get me some of Willa's blood.
Don't care if I have to stab her to get it.
Where's Willa?
Hey, where's Willa?
Who the fuck's Willa?
Dance with me.
No.
Willa!
( slurred ) Sugar, I've had a little too much to drink so you're gonna just have to get to the point.
Willa:
Okay, since Eric released me,
I need a job, so I was wondering if maybe I could be a waitress--
Lettie Mae, stop!
- ( screams )
- What the fuck?
!
( grunts )
- ( vampires hiss ) - ( screams )
Get back!
Get the fuck back!
- I'm okay, I'm okay.
- Sam:
She's okay.
She's okay, y'all.
Put your fangs away.
Lafayette:
What the hell's goings on here?
Lettie Mae stabbed Willa.
Of course she did.
What the fuck, Auntie?
Tara has been trying to contact me from the other side.
She's stuck, and the only way I can find out what she needs is with Willa's blood.
Come on before you get killed.
Come on, come on.
You're all looking at me like I'm crazy, but it's only because I used to have a drinking problem that people don't believe me!
You stabbed somebody, Auntie!
That's why people think you crazy.
Come on.
You're all fucking crazy, if you ask me.
What the fuck are we doing here, huh?
When just three days ago a group of rabid vampires came and attacked the town and killed a bunch of people and kidnapped us, right?
Arlene, Jane, Holly, and I, we were fucking chained in a dungeon and we--
( quietly ) Let's go to another room and talk about this.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
- Yes.
No, no, Sam.
No!
I know you don't want to hear this, but it needs to be said 'cause it's real.
Damn it, people are dead, people are traumatized, and the reaction you all have to this is to throw a party?
You fucking kidding me?
Now, I ain't for stabbing people, but at least Lettie Mae gets it.
Shit, I mean, you all are going on like this shit's normal and it's not.
This shit doesn't happen in other towns.
- Take me home.
I wanna go home.
- Okay.
- I wanna go home.
- Okay, okay.
- Here's your knife.
- Thanks.
Hey, I'm gonna make sure they get home safe.
Thanks, Violet.
I don't know.
Maybe Lafayette is right.
- What about?
- James and I.
Maybe we don't belong together.
You did meet in a prison camp, Jess.
Careful, Jason.
You know, people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
I see your point.
Yeah, Violet.
She's pretty weird, ain't she?
I mean, she's-- she's ancient and sexy as hell, but she's a little...
- Off?
- Yeah. ( chuckles )
She's way the fuck off sometimes.
You think maybe that's why...
No, why what?
We're supposed to be talking about you, Jess.
Yeah, I don't really feel like thinking about me anymore.
Go on, what?
Well, okay, then.
It was like earlier tonight when we were digging in trying to find Gran's ring to give it to Andy,
Violet was like, "I don't need a ring to prove to the world that you are mine."
( chuckles )
All I kept thinking was, "Jesus, please.
Sweet baby Jesus, put that ring on Holly's finger before it winds up on Violet's."
I mean, that was my Gran's ring, Jess.
It meant a lot that she wanted to give that to me.
Hell, man, I would love to have put it on someone one day.
But if that someone had to be Violet...
I don't know.
- Oh, Jason.
- What?
I think you might just be the sweetest man in the world.
( gasps )
( music playing )
Pam:
Of all the horrible things I've seen in the last 100 years, this could be the most disturbing.
Yeah.
Oh, come on.
It's fun because we're together.
No, it isn't.
What do Mommy and Daddy look like again?
Ah.
( laughs )
Pam:
Someone's having a good time.
You think Daddy'd be enjoying himself this much if Sarah got to him first?
I'll get him alone.
You mingle, find the mother.
How?
All these bitches look the same.
( chuckles )
- Mommy?
- ( gasps )
Oh, my God.
Hi, Mommy.
Sarah, what in he--
The whole world is looking for you.
What are you doing here?
Have you lost your ever-lovin' mind?
Oh, my God.
I missed you so much.
You look so pretty in that suit.
I forgot how beautiful you were.
What do you want?
And what have you done to your hair?
I'm in trouble.
Well, no shit, baby girl.
No, I mean real trouble.
And I need help from someone high up.
Someone powerful, right here, right now.
Is Laura Bush out there?
No, she is not.
Well, can you call her?
Sarah, Laura stopped taking my calls just about the time that that book came out claiming that my daughter is the monster who created the monsters who are scaring the shit out of half the country.
Now, is that true?
Yes.
But I'm not a monster.
I'm a Buddhist.
What?
Look, you have got to get out of here.
If the liberal media finds out that you are at this event, they are never gonna let you be--
No, Mommy, stop.
Listen very closely.
The Yakuza are after me.
Oh, darlin'.
( panting )
( moaning )
( panting, moaning continue )
( chatter )
Paul?
I need to ask you some questions about your daughter.
Has she come to see you?
( screams )
( crowd screaming )
( gunshots )
( both scream )
- The Yakuza?
- Uh-huh.
- Go, move!
Get out!
- ( screaming, shouting )
- Where is your daughter?
- I don't know!
- ( panting ) - ( automatic gunfire )
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
( panting )
- Come on!
- Go on, baby!
( screams )
( gasps )
( choking )
( grunting )
( inhales )
What are you doing out here, my love?
Someday soon you'll be buried here, too.
I don't want to fight.
But I don't see a way out.
- Do you?
- No.
I have loved you since the very first time I ever saw you.
( chuckles )
Long back as I can remember.
You are my first and only true love.
And you are mine.
I will survive this war, Caroline.
And when it's all over, I will come back to you... and to the children.
I promise you.

[GINGER GASPING AND WHIMPERING]
I don't give a shit.
I am not going with you.
- I would rather die than get in that coffin.
- You will do what your maker tells you.
He may be my maker, but he sure as fuck didn't raise me.
Tara did.
She was the one who taught me how to feed how to control my impulses.
He left, and then you left her when we needed you most.
We have bigger problems than your mommy--
- She died because of you!
ERIC:
Enough!
[SIGHS]
You're right.
I've been a terrible maker to you.
And for that I am truly sorry.
But I do not regret turning you and I am proud to call you my progeny.
Why did you come back for me?
Pam and I are gonna kill Sarah Newlin before I meet the true death.
You can count me out.
She was practically your stepmother, Willa.
If you have any idea where she might be I need to know it.
- I'm not goin with you.
- Like fuck you aren't.
WILLA:
But I will tell you what I know if you release me.
Willa Burrell I renounce the ties of our blood and my dominion over you as my progeny.
As your maker I release you.
[PANTING THEN SIGHS]
Like being kicked in the cooch by a wallaby, isn't it?
Sarah has a sister.
Oh, no shit, Willa.
The whole world knows that.
- You'd better know more.
- Her name is Amber.
- Amber Mills.
- Mm.
And she's a vampire.
Oh...
Heh.
How the fuck could Sarah Newlin have a vampire sister and the world not know it?
I don't know, but I overheard her one night on the phone at the governor's mansion.
Sarah was warning her never to call there again or my father would send her to camp.
Any idea where this Amber lives?
The call came from a Dallas area code.
Good girl.
Ginger?
Tell the driver we're heading for Dallas.
And we'll only be needing two travel coffins.
What?
No.
You just got back.
And if you walk out that door, I ain't never gonna see you again, am I?
Take me with you.
Put me in the third coffin.
- Sorry.
- Wha--?
You're sorry?
I have been your sex slave for 15 years, Eric Northman and we ain't never had sex.
blow job, hand job, nothing.
Do you know what a sex slave is without the sex?
A slave?
Now, you are taking me with you to Dallas.
And if you can't fucking take me then you had better fucking fuck me before you go.
Ginger, I'm diseased.
So the fuck am I.
[SCREAMING]
No!
[CONTINUES SCREAMING]
LAFAYETTE:
Sook?
Hey.
SOOKIE:
Hey.
I came as soon as I heard.
About Alcide?
About everything.
How is you holding up?
[VOICE BREAKING] The house is so empty.
Well, that big man of yours did take up a lot of space.
- Sorry.
- No, I'm sorry, Sook.
[IN NORMAL VOICE] I gotta clean up.
Jackson will be here in the morning--
- No, don't worry about that.
- No, what you need is some sleep.
When's the last time you got some shut-eye?
Let me put you to bed.
- Lafayette?
- Yes, ma'am?
Don't leave.
Sook, I will be here when you wake up.
So don't fret, okay?
Night-night.
[CLATTERING]
[THUDDING]
SOOKIE:
What the hell?
[DOOR OPENS THEN CLOSES]
Look who's up.
- Where's all his--?
- In the truck.
Uh...
When Alcide's mama died, the hardest part was going through all her things.
You just say when you wanna go through it all when you feel you're ready and Jenny and me will have you out to the place and we'll figure it all out.
Yeah, we'll figure it out.
[JAMES JENNY LAUGHING]
Hey.
The undead has arisen.
- Hey, Sookie.
- How'd you sleep?
You wanna tell me why there's enough food to choke a horse on my dining room table?
Child, me and Jenny was busting our humps cooking all the livelong day.
Well, that's-
- That's real sweet but I can't eat all this.
There's enough food here to feed the whole town off of.
Well the whole town will be here.
[LAFAYETTE JENNY CHUCKLE]
- What?
- Uh-huh.
Wait, are--?
Are y'all throwing a party?
- Yeah.
Sookie, come on.
- In my house?
The day after--
I know what you're probably thinking, honey.
But death doesn't have to be such a sad thing.
Actually, it does.
Death is inherently sad.
I'm sad.
I'm not in the mood for a party.
Sook.
Sook.
Sook, what did you say last night when you came home?
About how this house was feeling so empty?
That's why we gonna fill it up.
So we can say "fuck you" to death and "hello" to life.
JENNY:
Yeah.
- And that's what we doing.
We are motherfucking celebrating life.
I'm going back to sleep.
What would Tara want?
What would Alcide want?
Alcide would want people to be around you tonight.
Yes, ma'am, so take that pretty little ass of yours upstairs and get presentable.
Because folk gonna be here soon with some top-shelf alcohol and I got one restriction.
Not a nan person come up to you and say:
"Oh, I'm sorry for your loss." Mm-mm.
None of that bullshit.
- Hear, hear, I say.
JAMES:
That's right.
LAFAYETTE:
Come on, hooker.
Let's bring out the vittles and bits.
JAMES:
And that chicken Jenny made.
LAFAYETTE:
It ain't as good as mine.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
BILL:
Sookie?
Oh.
This is not happening.
- Am I early?
- Why?
Do I not look ready?
Actually, best not answer that.
I only just now found out about the party I'm hosting tonight.
I see.
Um...
I didn't have any alcohol on hand, as requested.
My mother always taught me it was ungentlemanly to turn up to a gathering empty-handed so I brought you these.
Well, I guess I'd better go upstairs and put my face on but in the meantime, I invite you in.
[DOORBELL RINGS]
Amber Mills?
Who are you?
AMBER:
I was always the black sheep of the family.
Started fangbanging right out of high school while Little Miss Perfect's marrying Steven Newlin.
[WHOOSHING]
- She's not here.
- Just like I told you she wasn't.
We had to be sure.
Your boyfriend?
Jeremy.
He was the one that turned me.
He helped me get my shit together.
But the second I turn, Sarah freaks.
She's married into the Fellowship of the Sun, after all.
But she knows I'm broke so she starts paying me off, a monthly cash delivery to stay in the coffin.
Then she goes out and she tells the world that her sister was taken by those evil vampires that I disappeared into thin air.
But I was here the whole time.
Jeremy and me sitting around watching House Hunters marathons and drinking Tru Blood.
What happened to Jeremy?
Same thing that's happening to us.
One day, he gets the veins.
A few months later, he's dying in my arms.
Sometimes I beat myself up over it.
If I hadn't taken her money, if I had come out--
She would have had you killed and kept on walking.
None of this is your fault.
It's your sister's which is why Pam and I are going after her.
And will you help us fin her?
Are you gonna kill her?
There's a real good chance that's the way it's gonna go down.
Then you can count me in.
ERIC:
Mm.
- I like her.
I like you.
Is it all right if I haven't made up my mind about you yet?
Yeah, I really like her.
When's the last time you saw Sarah?
Oh, it's been years now.
But she did call here this morning.
She said she just got to Dallas and she needed a place to hide.
I told her to fuck off.
She's in Dallas.
Any idea where else she might've gone?
Where she always goes, to Mommy and Daddy.
Even though she disgraced the family, they always fall for her BS.
And where do Mommy and Daddy live?
Why, Preston Hollow, of course.
But they won't be home tonight.
Probably already left for this.
The second I told her that's where Mommy and Daddy were going, she hung up.
- She'll be there.
- Looks like we're going to a gala.
You have a picture of your parents I can borrow?
You'll never get in.
You're vampires.
Security's gonna be tight and they only invited assholes.
You don't know us, sweetheart.
We can be assholes.
I wanna go.
I wanna say goodbye to my girl.
There's gonna be alcohol and vampires at Sookie's.
Know how you're always saying that eyes are the windows to the soul?
Lettie Mae, please.
Look into mine.
I ain't going to that party looking for no vamper blood.
I just wanna say goodbye because there won't be no grave in no cemetery where I can visit my Tara.
Ain't nothing left of her to bury.
I'm so sorry, sweetheart, but no.
No, no, I have to do what's best for you whether you like it or not.
Now, look, let me take care of you tonight.
Please.
All right?
All right.
Now, come on, give me a taste because I wanna make this just how you like it.
Come on.
Needs cumin.
Okay, all right, I'll...

Well, ladies, we dodged a bullet.
- Yeah, we did.

Amazing what a little shut-eye can do to calm the nerves.

After what we all went through I'm gonna make some major changes in my life...
-...clean up my act.

I'm gonna finally get my shit together.

[HORSE NEIGHS]
Minus.
Mr. Compton.
I ain't seen you since your daddy died.
It's good to see you, Minus.
- What's going on?
Why's everyone going--?
- What's going on, William Compton is that Lincoln has called his soldiers.
Called his soldiers?
- Charles, are you saying--?
- That's right, William, war.
Everyone's gonna enlist.
Based on our education and you and me being from prominent families we're guaranteed to be made commissioned officers.
Isn't that thrilling?
[CHUCKLES]
[CROWD CHEERS]
It is our God-given right to live our lives as we see fit without interference.
And I, for one, am willing to do whatever it takes to lay down my life, if necessary to preserve that God-given right.
Are we gonna let a bunch of Yankee cowards...
- Huh?
CROWD:
No!
Then it is the sovereign right of the state of Louisiana to secede from the union!
[CROWD CHEERS]
Mr. Dupont's right.
Fort Sumter was just the beginning.
[CROWD CHEERS]
You see, we cannot, we must not let them destroy our way of life.
We have no choice but to fight.
[CROWD CHEERS]
With what?
[CROWD MURMURING]
This is a lost cause.
The Yankees have better artillery and more sophisticated weaponry than we do.
What they will destroy is our town.
Scorch our land and our livelihoods.

Get out of my bar, William Compton.
We got no room here for Yankee sympathizers.
I'm sorry if you find the truth offensive, Mr. Bodehouse.

- Thanks, so do you.

Yeah, I have to admit finally getting a chance to shower up makes all the difference.
I was talking to Violet.
- Oh.
- Tsk.
Oh, Sookie, my sister.
Oh, I know we're not supposed to say we're sorry for your loss but I am so very sorry.
I've had about a hundred boyfriends die on me over the years but I remember how painful those first ones were.
There you are, Sookie.
You look like you could do with something to eat.
I hear there are two kinds of chicken to try.
Excuse us.
What?
"I've had about a hundred boyfriends die on me, but I--"
Shut up and come dance with me.

Alcide could be an arrogant little shit even when he was a kid.
You'd tell him to go left, and he'd go right just to piss you off.
He'd question everything.
Now, fighting it's a way of life where we come from.
But Alcide, he wouldn't fight just for the sake of fighting.
In fact, he told me once, "I'll fight when I'm good and ready.
I'll fight when I have something worth fighting for."
You were worth it, Sookie.
Otherwise he wouldn't have fought for you.
My boy died a hero.
But you can't die a hero without having a righteous cause.
Thank you.

- To Alcide.

Excuse me.
Uh-uh.
No, Lettie Mae.
You can't come up in here causing no scene.
- Mm-mm.
- I am so sorry for your loss.
Lettie Mae.
You wanna say a few words about Tara?
[LAFAYETTE SIGHS]
LETTIE MAE:
First off, I'd like to say my heart goes out to you, Mr. Herveaux.
I'm sad for you but I'm also glad for you, because your son died a hero.
My Tara was a hero too.
Most of you know I made some big mistakes raising her.
Most of you know I didn't raise her.
That's because you did.
Her friends.
Still, though she sacrificed herself trying to save me even after all the pain I caused her.
And that's just beyond heroic in my book.
So I wanna ask you to join me in raising a glass to her.
You got anything non-alcoholic?
JASON:
Yeah.
Here you go.
Thank you, deputy.
To my baby girl.
To Tara.
ALL:
To Tara.
[MOUTHS] Thank you.
How's the party?
You should come inside.
JESSICA:
I'm fine.
- Jessica--
- Andy.
I can't.
Did it ever occur to you that you torturing yourself over my girls keeps that pain alive for me too?
You ever think about that?
This has been a hell of a week we're having, but during it you have been there.
You have been good to Adilyn.
You helped bring Holly back to me and her boys.
I don't know if I'm supposed to be taking some message from all this bullshit that's been going on, but I'm taking one anyhow.
Life's too short.
Jessica, it's too fucking precious to always be looking backwards.
I'm moving forwards.
But I'm gonna need your help to do that.
How can I help?
You got a ring I can borrow?
A ring, but--?
Oh, my God.
- Are you gonna propose to Holly tonight?
- Please don't make this...
-...a bigger deal than it already is.
- Oh.
But it is a big deal.
I know that.
Jesus Christ, I'm freaking out inside.
Just give me a ring before I change my mind.
Andy, you can't propose to Holly with any of these.
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
I ain't exactly had time to go to the mall.
Come on.
Wait up.
Are you sure you don't mind me borrowing it, Sookie?
SOOKIE:
Not at all.
Gran would've loved Holly.
Although she did leave it to Jason to give to the woman he was gonna marry.
JASON:
That's right, she did.
You're already mine, Jason.
I don't need a ring to tell me that.
Well, here it is.

Oh, my God.
It's beautiful.
That's it?

What's up?
[HOLLY LAUGHING]
[HOLLY CONTINUES LAUGHING THEN SPEAKS INDISTINCTLY]
Andy?
Andy, what's wrong?
Could we kill the music, please?
On it.
[MUSIC STOPS]
Andy, oh, my God.
What are you doing?
Holly, I-
- I'm--
I don't know-
- I-
- I can't--
I don't know what I'm about to say but I have been waiting for the perfect moment to do this but something keeps getting in the way.
It wasn't until you went missing that I realized that something this whole time was me.
See, I got this voice in my head that says I don't deserve a woman as beautiful as you are.
I don't deserve a woman as kind as you are.
And I probably don't, but...
I know the timing's weird, and you got all kinds of healing to do...
- Oh.
-...but, please wear this ring for me?
I'll go through all of it with you...
-...every step of the way.
- Yes.
[PEOPLE MURMURING]
I didn't ask you yet.
You gotta let me ask you.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Sorry.
[PEOPLE CHUCKLING]
Jumped the gun.
Uh, Holly Cleary, I love you with everything I got.
Will you marry me?
[PEOPLE CHEERING AND APPLAUDING]
[JASON HOWLING]
[MUSIC RESUMES]
JASON:
That's lovely, man.
- I love you, Andy.
SAM:
Ha-ha-ha.
- Let's go congratulate them.
- Yeah.
- Hey.
- What?
What?
- You just seem happy is all.
- Well, I am.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Seriously?
Now?
Yeah, it's been a while since...
I know, but we're at a party.
Okay?
Don't be such a wet blanket.
Just try to have fun, and we'll leave later, okay?
SAM:
Oh, man.
What a surprise.
You doing okay?
- Yeah.
- You fixing to cry?
I think I might be.
Come on, let's sneak upstairs.
Don't get me wrong, I am so happy for Andy and Holly.
It's just a little bit more of a celebration of life than I was ready for.
You miss him?
How can I miss someone I can't even believe is dead?
ARLENE:
Alcide dying's a bit of a shock, sweetie.
SOOKIE:
That's the thing.
It never occurred to me that Alcide could die.
He's just so big and strong, and he just--
It don't matter how big or strong someone is if someone else has a gun.
It was the same way with Terry.
It happened so fast, came out of nowhere.
The thing is, though when it comes to loving a man and then losing him it doesn't matter how it happens, because he's still gone.
You still have that hole inside you, and it hurts just the same no matter how prepared you are for it or not.
Oh.
When Terry died, I thought I was gonna die right along with him.
How did you get through it?
[SIGHS]
At night, when no one was looking sometimes I'd put his jacket on just so I could feel his arms around me again.
[CHUCKLES]
You never get over the loss of someone you love.
You just learn to live with it.
And nothing's gonna help heal this pain you're feeling but time.
And tequila.
[BOTH LAUGHING]
How about a little tequila?
SOOKIE:
There's not enough tequila in the world to get me through tonight.
"Wet blanket"?
Do she even know who you is?
- She gives me just enough love.
- Mm.
And just enough affection to keep me hooked.
That's just like paying the minimum on your credit card bill each month just to keep that fucker from getting canceled.
That's exactly what it's like.
- Mm.
- Jesus Christ, am I that fucking simple?
No, sir.
There's nothing simple about you at all.
The night we met remember that story you told me about how you was turned?
- Mm-hm.
- Can I ask a follow-up question?
Of course.
Danny Monoghan.
What about him?
Was y'all...?
Yeah.
I told the saleswoman my wife and I were going to an exclusive high-society event and that only the very best would do.
Voilà.
Oh, my God.
I'm a Republi-cunt.
[CHUCKLES]
- You think that's funny, huh?
- Mm-hm.
Wait till you see what that nice man at Neiman's and I picked out for you.
Strip.
Oh, fuck, Eric.
You're stage two.
Just cover the ones that will be visible.
Okay.
[PAM SIGHS]
I'm gonna die, Pam.
You have to accept that.
[SNIFFLES]
[UPBEAT POP MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
Whoo!
[GASPS]
- My God, there he is.
SOOKIE:
There who is?
That vampire who gave me his blood.
He's been making eyes at me ever since he got here.
Evening, Arlene.
SOOKIE:
Heh.
Hey, Keith.
Um, Arlene here is super grateful on account of you, you know saving her life last night and all, but she's been through a lot, so you might wanna I don't know, dial down your sexy a notch.
KEITH:
Heh.
[CHUCKLING]
I understand.
And I can wait.
Sookie, would you please tell your friend that I think she's the most beautiful woman I've seen in over 300 years?
[WHISPERING] And I'll see her in her dreams.
Um...
I have to go make tinkle because, you know, I am a human.
Arlene, have you seen James?
- Huh?
- James.
Have you seen him?
I've been looking everywhere.
I think I saw him step outside with Lafayette a little while ago.
Thanks.
[GRUNTING AND PANTING]
You incredible asshole!
- Get out of here.
- I am so sorry.
Really, James?
That's what you have to say?
That you are sorry?
Need I remind you that I just found you...
-...fucking a man in our car?
- Jessica, please--
Get the fuck out of my way.
JAMES:
Will you come outside and talk to me?
- Jason?
- Yeah, what's going on?
- Can we please talk?
- There is nothing to say.
Would you rescind his invitation to this house?
- What'd he do?
What did you do?
- I found him fucking Lafayette in the car that he and I bought together.
Get the fuck out of here, James.
[DOOR CLOSES]
- I should probably--
- Yeah, okay.
Go.
You all right?
Look.
I just wanna be alone right now.
Okay.
In case you need a place to crash, you know where I live.
[SIGHS]
You mean with all that--
That sensitive musician shit, it never occurred to you that he might be gay?
I don't think that he is gay.
I think that he-
- He's just--
- He's confused.
- Jess, I gotta be honest with you.
Based on what you saw him doing outside...
-...it all sounds pretty gay to me.
- Oh, my God.
[KNOCK ON DOOR]
- Who is it?
LAFAYETTE:
It's me.
Go away.
JASON:
Whoa.
- Look, Red, I know this shit got to hurt--
Don't you dare presume to know me.
You do not know the first thing about me.
And you don't know the first thing about him.
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you.
You know what?
When was he turned?
How was he turned?
Who turned him?
And where's he from back before he got turned?
Ms. Ma'am, you don't know any of this shit, do you?
I do because I cared enough to ask him, and he cared enough to tell me.
Now, listen, I know the way this shit went down is real embarrassing.
But if you keep it 100 with yourself and honest you know this is not the man for you.
- He's the man for you?
- If he is what's so fucking unimaginable about that, Red?
Huh?
Everybody else in this town is falling in love and getting engaged and having babies.
Has it ever occurred to you that Lafayette, that queen that make all you white heterosexuals laugh and feel good about yourselves...
Has it fucking ever occurred to you that maybe I want a piece of happiness too?
No.
[SIGHS]
James is a good man.
He's a vampire, Lafayette.
Whatever he is.
If you don't love him, let him go.
And I will take over from here.
WOMAN 1:
I was wrong about that Sookie Stackhouse.
It wasn't her fault.
Hep-vamps were taking out town after town.
WOMAN 2:
I feel bad about the things I said.
MAN:
Her guy gave his life for her.
WOMAN 3:
Lost the man she loved trying to save our town.
MAN:
I wonder if I'd have the courage to do the same.
WOMAN 4:
She's lost more people than anyone.
Here she is being hostess.
WOMAN 5:
She's got a heart bigger than all of Louisiana.
WILLA:
Hey, Sookie.
- Hey.
- You okay?
- I'm drunk.
- Oh, okay.
Well, you deserve to be.
Have you seen Arlene?
No, have--?
Have you seen Bill?
[MAN 1 SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY]
There's a safe house just on the other side of the bridge.
That's good people.
They'll give us food, shelter for the night.
Get our strength up so we can keep going north come morning.
[HORSE NEIGHS]
Shh.
Get down.
Everybody down.
MAN 2:
Keep going!
MAN 3:
All right, come on.
[BABY CRYING]
[SHUSHING]
[CRYING CONTINUES]
Okay, they're gone.
We're safe.
- You scared?
- Yeah, I suppose I am.
All right, folks, it's gonna be all right.
We gots to keep moving, though.
MAN 4:
Let's go.
- We've come this far and we almost--
[GUNSHOT]
[BABY CRYING]
Well, well, look who we have here.
You had no right to kill that man.
He was a good man.
- You had no goddamn right.
- Oh, actually, I do.
Now, if you would kindly hand over that map.
[BABY CONTINUES CRYING]
Do it!
Hey.
Hey!
- No!
No!
No!
- Get out of the way, Caroline!
Please, Charles, I beg of you.
Please think of the children.
[GRUNTS]
[YELLS THEN GUNSHOT]
You let that man serve as a warning of what we do to any and all deserters no matter what their color.
Hyah!
[DANCE MUSIC PLAYING INSIDE]
Bill?
I'm coming out.
Is it safe?
Yeah, it's safe, Sookie.
You don't look quite right.
Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
I'm just thinking is all.
- Well, then, stop.
The whole point of this celebration is so that we don't sit around here with long faces.
You haven't socialized at all tonight.
I know everyone's pleased to see you here.
No, they're pleased to see you, Sookie.
You've done well.
You've done more these last several days than I've managed to achieve in decades.
Mainstreaming.
- I didn't do this.
- Yeah, you did.
Well I've had a lovely evening.
SOOKIE:
You can't leave yet.
BILL:
No, I should be on my way.
But I had a wonderful time.
But I must admit, this concept of men and women being friends was a little bit foreign in my day.
- Bill?
- Yeah?
Thank you.
For what?
For seeing me the way I can't see myself sometimes.
Come on.
Good night, Bill.
Good night, Sookie.
WOMAN:
Look at her smiling like that, how she lights up the room.
LETTIE MAE:
Heard Willa was here.
Can't figure out what my Tara's trying to tell me unless I get me some of Willa's blood.
Don't care if I have to stab her to get it.
Where's Willa?
- Hey.
Where's Willa?
- Who the fuck's Willa?
- Dance with me.
- No.
Willa?
Sugar, I've had a little too much to drink, so you're gonna just have to get to the point.
Okay, since Eric released me, I need a job, so I was wondering if maybe...
-...
I could be a waitress--
- Lettie Mae, stop.
- Aah!
- What the fuck?
[GRUNTING]
- Get back!
Get the fuck back!
WILLA:
I'm okay.
- I'm okay.
SAM:
She's okay.
She's okay, y'all.
Put your fangs away.
LAFAYETTE:
What the hell's goings on here?
Lettie Mae stabbed Willa.
Of course she did.
What the fuck, Auntie?
Tara has been trying to contact me from the other side.
She's stuck.
And the only way I can find out what she needs is with Willa's blood.
- Come on, before you get killed.
Come on.
- You're all looking at me like I'm crazy.
Because I used to have a drinking problem, people don't believe me.
You stabbed somebody, Auntie.
That's why people think you crazy.
Come on.
You're all fucking crazy, if you ask me.
What the fuck are we doing here?
Huh?
When just three days ago a group of rabid vampires came and attacked the town and killed a bunch of people and kidnapped us, right?
Arlene, Jane, Holly and I, we were fucking chained in a dungeon and we--
Let's go to another room and talk about this.
- Oh, no, no, no.
No, Sam.
- Okay?
No.
I know you don't wanna hear this, but it needs to be said.
It's real.
Damn it, people are dead, people are traumatized and the reaction you all have to this is to throw a party?
You fucking kidding me?
Now, I ain't for stabbing people, but at least Lettie Mae gets it.
Shit, I mean, you all are going on like this shit's normal, and it's not.
This shit doesn't happen in other towns.
- Take me home.
I wanna go home.
- Hey.
- I wanna go home.
- Hey, hey.
Here's your knife.
Thanks.
- Hey, I'm gonna make sure they get home safe.
- Thanks, Violet.
I don't know.
Maybe Lafayette is right.
- What about?
- James and I.
Maybe we don't belong together.
You did meet in a prison camp, Jess.
Careful, Jason.
You know, people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
I see your point.
Yeah, Violet.
She's pretty weird, ain't she?
I mean, she's--
She's ancient and sexy as hell, but she's a little...
- Off?
- Yeah.
Ha, ha.
She's way the fuck off sometimes.
You think maybe that's why...?
No, why what?
We're supposed to be talking about you, Jess.
Yeah, I don't really feel like thinking about me anymore.
Go on.
- What?
- Well, okay, then.
It was like earlier tonight, when we were digging in trying to find Gran's ring to give it to Andy Violet was like, "I don't need a ring to prove to the world that you are mine."
All I kept thinking was, "Jesus, please.
Sweet baby Jesus put that ring on Holly's finger before it winds up on Violet's."
I mean, that was my Gran's ring, Jess.
It meant a lot that she wanted to give that to me.
Hell, man, I would've loved to have put it on someone one day.
But if that someone had to be Violet...
I don't know.
- Oh, Jason.
- What?
I think you might just be the sweetest man in the world.
[PEOPLE CHATTERING AND COUNTRY MUSIC PLAYING OVER SPEAKERS]
PAM:
Of all the horrible things I've seen in the last 100 years this could be the most disturbing.
ERIC:
Yeah.
Oh, come on.
It's fun because we're together.
No, it isn't.
What do Mommy and Daddy look like again?
Ah.
[LAUGHING]
Someone's having a good time.
You think Daddy'd be enjoying himself this much if Sarah got to him first?
ERIC:
I'll get him alone.
You mingle, find the mother.
How?
all these bitches look the same.
Mommy?
[GASPS]
- Oh, my God.
- Hi, Mommy.
Sarah, what in he--?
[LOCK CLICKS]
The whole world is looking for you.
What are you doing here?
Have you lost your ever-loving mind?
Oh, my God.
I missed you so much.
You look so pretty in that suit.
I forgot how beautiful you were.
What do you want?
And what have you done to your hair?
I'm in trouble.
Well, no shit, baby girl.
No, I mean real trouble.
And I need help from someone high up.
Someone powerful, right here, right now.
Is Laura Bush out there?
No, she is not.
Well, can you call her?
Sarah, Laura stopped taking my calls just about the time that that book came out claiming that my daughter is the monster who created the monsters who are scaring the shit out of half the country.
Now, is that true?
Yes.
But I'm not a monster.
I'm a Buddhist.
What?
Look, you have gotta get out of here.
If the liberal media finds out you are at this event, they are never gonna--
No, Mommy, stop.
Listen very closely.
The yakuza are after me.
Oh, darling.
[MOANING AND PANTING]

What are you doing out here, my love?
Someday soon you'll be buried here too.
I don't want to fight.
But I don't see a way out.
Do you?
No.
I have loved you since the very first time I ever saw you.
Long back as I can remember.
You are my first and only true love.
And you are mine.
I will survive this war, Caroline.
And when it's all over I will come back to you and to the children.
I promise you.
( Ginger gasping )
I don't give a shit!
I am not going with you.
I would rather die than get in that coffin!
You will do what your maker tells you to do.
He may be my maker, but he sure as fuck didn't raise me.
Tara did.
She was the one who taught me how to feed, how to control my impulses.
He left, and then you left her when we needed you most.
We have bigger fucking problems than your mommy and your daddy--
- She died because of you!
- I am sorry--
Enough!
( sighs )
You're right.
I've been a terrible maker to you.
And for that I am truly sorry.
But I do not regret turning you, and I'm proud to call you my progeny.
Why did you come back for me?
Pam and I are gonna kill Sarah Newlin before I meet the true death.
You can count me out.
She was practically your stepmother, Willa.
If you have any idea where she might be,
I need to know it.
- I'm not going with you.
- Like fuck you aren't.
But I will tell you what I know if you release me.
Willa Burrell,
I renounce the ties of our blood and my dominion over you as my progeny.
As your maker...
- I release you.
- ( gasps )
Like being kicked in the cooch by a wallaby, isn't it?
Sarah has a sister.
Oh, no shit, Willa.
The whole world knows that.
- You'd better know more.
- Her name is Amber.
Amber Mills.
And she's a vampire.
Oh.
How the fuck could Sarah Newlin have a vampire sister and the world not know about it?
I don't know, but I overheard her one night on the phone at the governor's mansion.
Sarah was warning her never to call there again or my father would send her to camp.
Any idea where this Amber lives?
The call came from a Dallas area code.
Good girl.
- Ginger?
- ( gasps )
Tell the driver we're heading for Dallas.
And we'll only be needing two travel coffins.
What?
No!
You just got back.
And if you walk out that door,
I ain't never gonna see you again, am I?
Take me with you.
Put me in the third coffin.
- Sorry.
- What-- you're sorry?
I have been your sex slave for 15 years, Eric Northman, and we ain't never had sex.
Blow job, hand job, nothing.
Do you know what a sex slave is without the sex?
A slave?
Now, you are taking me with you to Dallas.
And if you can't fucking take me, then you had better fuckin' fuck me before you go.
Ginger, I'm diseased.
So the fuck am I!

No!

Sook?
Hey.
Hey.
I came as soon as I heard.
Ab-- about Alcide?
About everything.
How is you holding up?
( voice breaking ) The house is so empty.
Well, that big man of yours did take up a lot of space.
- Sorry.
- No, I'm sorry, Sook.
I gotta clean up.
- Jackson will be here in the morning.
- No, don't worry about that.
- We'll take care of this.
- No, what you need is some sleep.
When's the last time you got some serious shut-eye?
Come on, let me put you to bed.
Lafayette?
Yes, ma'am?
Don't leave.
Sook, I will be here when you wake up.
So don't fret, 'kay?
Night-night.
( distant clanking )
( thuds )
( objects clattering )
What the hell?
( door opens, closes )
Look who's up.
- Where's all his--
- In the truck.
When Alcide's mama died, the hardest part was going through all her things.
You just say when you wanna go through it all, when you feel you're ready, and Jenny and me will have you out to the place and we'll figure it all out.
Yeah, we'll figure it out.
- ( laughter )
- Hey!
The undead has arisen.
- Hey, there, Sookie.
- How'd you sleep?
Lafayette, you wanna tell me why there's enough food to choke a horse on my dining room table?
Child, me and Jenny was bustin' our humps cooking' all the livelong day.
Well, that's-- that's real sweet, but I can't eat all this.
There's enough food here to feed the whole town off of.
Well... the whole town will be here.
( laughs )
- What?
- Uh-huh.
Wait, are-- are y'all throwing a party?
- All:
Yeah!
- Sookie, come on.
In my house?
The day after--
I know what you're probably thinking, honey.
But death doesn't have to be such a sad thing.
Actually, it does.
Death is inherently sad.
I'm sad.
I'm not in the mood for a party.
Sook.
Sook!
Sook, what did you say last night when you came home?
About how this house was feeling so empty?
That's why we're gonna fill it up, so we can say "fuck you," to death and "hello," to life.
- Jenny:
Yeah.
- And that's what we're doing.
We are motherfucking celebrating life.
I'm going back to sleep.
What would Tara want?
What would Alcide want?
Alcide would want people to be around you tonight, Sookie.
Yes, ma'am, so take that pretty little ass of yours upstairs and get presentable.
'Cause folk gonna be here soon with some top-shelf alcohol, and I got one restriction-- not a nan person come up to you and say, "Oh, I'm sorry for your loss."
Mm-mm, none of that bullshit.
- Hear, hear, I say.
- James:
That's right.
Come on, hooker.
Let's bring out the rest of the vittles and bits.
James:
And that chicken Jenny made.
- Lafayette:
It ain't as good as mine.
- ( knock on door )
Bill:
Sookie?
Ugh, this is not happening.
- Am I early?
- Why, do I not look ready?
You know what, actually, best not answer that.
I only just now found out about the party I'm hosting tonight.
I see.
Um...
I didn't have any alcohol on hand, as requested.
My mother always taught me it was ungentlemanly to turn up to a gathering empty-handed, so, uh, I brought you these.
Well, I guess I'd better go upstairs and put my face on, but in the meantime, I invite you in.
( rings doorbell )
Amber Mills?
Who are you?
I was always the black sheep of the family.
Started fangbanging right outta high school while Little Miss Perfect's marrying Steven Newlin.
- ( doors closing )
- She's not here.
Just like I told you she wasn't.
We had to be sure.
Your boyfriend?
Jeremy.
He was the one that turned me.
He helped me get my shit together.
But the second I turn, Sarah freaks.
She's married into the Fellowship of the Sun, after all.
But she knows I'm broke, so she starts paying me off, a monthly cash delivery to stay in the coffin.
Then she goes out and she tells the world that her sister was taken from her by those evil vampires, that I disappeared into thin air.
But I was here the whole time.
Jeremy and me sittin' around watching "House Hunters" marathons and drinkin' Tru Blood.
What happened to Jeremy?
Same thing that's happening to us.
One day, he gets the veins.
A few months later, he's dying in my arms.
Sometimes I beat myself up over it.
I mean, if I hadn't taken her money, if I had come out instead of hiding--
She would've had you killed and kept on walking.
None of this is your fault.
It's your sister's, which is why Pam and I are going after her.
And will you help us find her?
Are you gonna kill her?
There's a real good chance that's the way it's gonna go down.
Then you can count me in.
Mm.
I like her.
I like you.
Is it all right if I haven't made up my mind about you yet?
Yeah, I really like her.
When's the last time you saw Sarah?
Oh, it's been years now.
But she did call here this morning.
She said she just got to Dallas and she needed a place to hide.
I told her to fuck off.
She's in Dallas.
Any idea where else she might've gone?
Where she always goes, to Mommy and Daddy.
Even though she disgraced the family, they always fall for her BS.
And where do Mommy and Daddy live?
Why, Preston Hollow, of course.
But they won't be home tonight.
Probably already left for this.
The second I told her that's where Mommy and Daddy were going, she hung up.
She'll be there.
Looks like we're going to a gala.
Do you have a picture of your parents I can borrow?
You'll never get in.
You're vampires.
Security's gonna be tight and they only invited assholes.
You don't know us, sweetheart.
We can be assholes.
I want to go.
I want to say good-bye to my girl.
But there's gonna be alcohol and vampires at Sookie's.
Know how you're always saying that eyes are the windows to the soul?
Lettie Mae, please.
Look into mine.
I ain't going to that party looking for no vamper blood.
I just want to say good-bye 'cause there won't be no grave in no cemetery where I can visit my Tara.
Ain't nothing left of her to bury.
I'm so sorry, sweetheart, but no.
No, no, I have to do what's best for you whether you like it or not.
Now, look, let me take care of you tonight.
Please.
All right?
All right.
Now, come on, give me a taste, 'cause I wanna make this just how you like it.
- Come on.
- ( blows )
Needs cumin.
Okay, all right, I'll...

Well, ladies, we dodged a bullet!
- Yeah, we did.
- Whoo!
Amazing what a little shut-eye can do to calm the nerves.
- Jane:
You know what, girls?
- Hmm?
After what we all went through,
I'm gonna make some major changes in my life,
- clean up my act.
- That is great, Jane.
I'm gonna finally get my shit together.
- Good for you, girl.
- Holly:
Amen.
Yeah.
- Starting tomorrow.
- ( all laughing )
I'm starting tomorrow, too, okay?
( laughing )
- To not dyin'.
- Amen.
Arlene:
If anyone knows how to live it up, it's you, Jane Bodehouse.
( horse neighs )
Minus.
Mr. Compton.
I ain't seen you since your daddy died.
It's good to see you, Minus.
What's going on?
Why's everyone goin'--
What's going on, William Compton... ( snaps ) is that Lincoln has called his soldiers.
Called his soldiers?
Charles, are you saying--
That's right, William, war.
Everyone's going to enlist.
Based on our education and you and me being from prominent families, we're all but guaranteed to be made commissioned officers.
Isn't that thrilling'?
( laughs )
( men shouting )
It is our God-given right to live our lives as we see fit,
- without interference.
- Crowd:
Yeah!
Charles:
And I, for one, am willing to do whatever it takes to lay down my life if necessary to preserve that God-given right.
Are we gonna let a bunch of Yankee cowards come on down here and take our freedoms?
- Huh?
- Crowd:
No!
Then it is the sovereign right of the state of Louisiana to secede from the union.
( crowd cheers )
Mr. DuPont's right.
Fort Sumter was just the beginning.
Crowd:
Yeah!
You see, we cannot, we must not let them destroy our way of life.
We have no choice but to fight.
Crowd:
Yeah!
With what?
( crowd murmuring )
This is a lost cause.
The Yankees have better artillery.
More sophisticated weaponry than we do.
What they will destroy is our town, scorch our land, our livelihoods.
Get outta my bar, William Compton.
We got no room here for Yankee sympathizers.
I'm sorry if you find the truth offensive, Mr. Bodehouse.
- Man:
Get out!
Go ahead!
- ( men shouting )
- ( music playing ) - ( partygoers laughing )
Holly:
To not dyin'.
Hey, Sook.
You look real pretty.
Thanks, so do you.
Yeah, yeah, I have to admit finally getting a chance to shower up makes all the difference.
I was talking to Violet.
Oh.
Tsk.
Oh, Sookie, my sister.
Oh, I know we're not supposed to say we're sorry for your loss, but I am so very sorry.
I've had about a hundred boyfriends die on me over the years, but I remember how painful those first ones were.
There you are, Sookie.
You look like you could do with something eat.
I hear there are two kinds of chicken to try.
Excuse us.
What?
"I've had about a hundred boyfriends die on me, but I--"
Shut up and come dance with me.
♪ Don't be afraid, I'll show you tonight... ♪
( TV playing in background )
( snoring softly )
Alcide could be an arrogant little shit, even when he was a kid.
You'd tell him to go left and he'd go right just to piss you off.
He'd question everything.
Now, fightin', it's a way of life where we come from, but Alcide, he wouldn't fight just for the sake of fighting'.
In fact, he told me once, "I'll fight when I'm good and ready.
I'll fight when I have something worth fighting for."
You were worth it, Sookie.
Otherwise he wouldn't have fought for you.
My boy died a hero.
But you can't die a hero without having a righteous cause.
Thank you.
To Alcide.
Others:
To Alcide.
- To Alcide.
- Alcide.
Lettie Mae:
'Scuse me.
Uh-uh, no, Lettie Mae.
You can't come up in here causing no scene.
- Mm-mm.
- I am so sorry for your loss.
Lettie Mae.
You wanna say a few words about Tara?
( heavy sigh )
First off, I'd like to say my heart goes out to you, Mr. Herveaux.
I'm sad for you, but I'm also glad for you because your son died a hero.
My Tara was a hero, too.
Most of you know I made some big mistakes raising her.
Most of you know I didn't raise her, that's 'cause you did-- her friends.
Still, though, she sacrificed herself trying to save me, even after all the pain I caused her.
And that's just beyond heroic in my book.
So I want to ask you to join me in raising a glass to her.
You got anything non-alcoholic?
Yeah.
Here you go.
Thank you, Deputy.
To my baby girl.
- To Tara.
- Others:
To Tara.
( mouths ) Thank you.
How's the party?
You should come inside.
I'm fine.
- Jessica--
- Andy.
I can't.
Did it ever occur to you that you torturing yourself over my girls keeps that pain alive for me, too?
You ever think about that?
This has been a hell of a week we're having, but during it you have been there.
You have been good to Adilyn.
You helped bring Holly back to me and her boys.
I don't know if I'm supposed to be taking some kind of message from all this bullshit that's been going on, but I'm taking one anyhow.
Life's too short.
Jessica, it's too fucking precious to always be looking backwards.
I'm moving forwards.
But I'm gonna need your help to do that.
How can I help?
( takes deep breath )
You got a ring I can borrow?
A ring, but-- oh, my God.
Are you gonna propose to Holly tonight?
Please don't make this a bigger deal than it already is.
But it is a big deal.
I know that!
Jesus Christ, I'm freakin' out inside.
Just give me a ring before I change my mind.
Andy, you can't propose to Holly with any of these.
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
I ain't exactly had time to go to the mall.
Come on.
Wait up!
Are you sure you don't mind me borrowing it, Sookie?
Not at all.
Gran would've loved Holly.
Although she did leave it to Jason to give to the woman he was gonna marry.
That's right, she did.
You're already mine, Jason.
I don't need a ring to tell me that.
Well, here it is.
Jessica:
Oh, my God.
It's beautiful.
That's it?
Holy crap, I'm really gonna do this, huh?
( Jessica laughs )
Andy, you got yourself a real good woman, man.
It's all yours.
( music playing )
You seen your mother?
Uh, pretty sure she's in the living room.
Y'all are gonna wanna see this.
Oh, come here.
A little word to the wise.
I don't know if the two of you are fuckin' or not, but if you are, it's gonna have to stop right now.
You got it?
What's up?
( laughing )
( Holly laughing )
Oh, you're bad.
Andy?
Andy, what's wrong?
Could we kill the music, please?
- On it.
- ( music stops )
Andy, oh, my God.
What are you doing?
Holly, I-
- I'm-- I don't know--
I-
- I can't-- ( sighs )
I don't know what I'm about to say, but I have been waiting for the perfect moment to do this, but something keeps getting in the way.
It wasn't until you went missing that I realized that something this whole time, was me.
See, I got this voice in my head that says I don't deserve a woman as beautiful as you are.
I don't deserve a woman as kind as you are.
And I probably don't, but...
I know the timing's weird and you got all kinds of healing to do.
- Oh.
- But, please... wear this ring for me?
I'll go through all of it with ya every step of the way.
Yes!
Crowd:
Aw!
I didn't ask you yet.
You gotta let me ask you.
Oh, I'm sorry.
- Sorry.
- ( laughter )
Jumped the gun.
Uh, Holly Cleary, I love you with everything I got.
Will you marry me?
( applause, cheering )
- ( ululating ) - ( cheering )
Jason:
That's lovely, man.
I love you, Andy!
Let's go congratulate 'em.
Yeah.
- Hey.
- What?
What?
- You just seem happy is all.
- Well, I am.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Seriously?
Now?
Yeah, it's been a while since...
I know, but we're at-- we're at a party.
Okay?
Don't be such a wet blanket.
Just try to have fun and we'll leave later, okay?
Oh, man, what a surprise.
You doing okay?
Yeah.
You fixing' to cry?
I think I might be.
Come on, let's sneak upstairs.
Don't get me wrong, I am so happy for Andy and Holly.
It's just a little bit more of a celebration of life than I was ready for.
You miss him?
How can I miss someone I can't even believe is dead?
Arlene:
Alcide dying's a bit of a shock, sweetie.
Sookie:
That's the thing.
It never occurred to me that Alcide could die.
He's just... so-- so big and strong and he just--
It don't matter how big or strong someone is if someone else has a gun.
It was the same way with Terry.
It happened so fast, came out of nowhere.
The thing is, though, when it comes to loving a man and then losing him, it doesn't matter how it happens 'cause he's still gone.
You still have that hole inside you and it hurts just the same no matter how prepared you are for it or not.
( sighs ) When Terry died,
I thought I was gonna die right along with him.
How did you get through it?
At night, when no one was lookin'... sometimes I'd put his jacket on just so I could feel his arms around me again.
( laughs )
You never get over the loss of someone you love.
You just learn to live with it.
And nothing's gonna help heal this pain you're feeling but time.
And tequila.
( both laughing )
How about a little tequila?
Sookie:
There's not enough tequila in the world to get me through tonight.
"Wet blanket"?
Do she even know who you is?
She gives me just enough love.
Mm.
And just enough affection to keep me hooked.
That's just like paying the minimum on your credit card bill each month just to keep that fucker from getting cancelled.
That's exactly what it's like.
Mm.
Jesus Christ, am I that fucking simple?
No, sir.
There's nothing simple about you at all.
The night we met, remember that story you told me about how you was turned?
Mm-hmm.
Can I ask a follow-up question?
Of course.
Danny Monoghan.
What about him?
Was y'all...
Yeah.
I told the sales woman my wife and I were going to an exclusive high society event and that only the very best would do.
Voilà.
Pam:
Oh, my God.
I'm a republi-cunt.
( laughs )
- You think that's funny, huh?
- Mm-hmm.
Wait till you see what that nice man at Neiman's and I picked out for you.
Strip.
Oh, fuck, Eric.
You're stage two.
Just cover the ones that will be visible.
Okay.
I'm gonna die, Pam.
You have to accept that.
( sniffles )
- ( music playing ) - ( whooping )
Whoo!
( gasps )
- My God, there he is.
- There who is?
That vampire who gave me his blood.
He's been making eyes at me ever since he got here.
- Evening, Arlene.
- ( Sookie laughs ) Hey, Keith.
Um, Arlene here is super grateful on account of you, you know, saving her life last night and all, but she's been through a lot, so you might wanna,
I don't know, dial down your sexy a notch.
( laughs )
I understand.
And I can wait.
Sookie, would you please tell your friend Arlene here that I think she's the most beautiful woman I've seen in over 300 years?
( whispers ) And I'll see her in her dreams.
Um...
I have to go make tinkle because, you know, I am a human.
Arlene, have you seen James?
Huh?
James-- have you seen him?
I've been looking everywhere.
I think I saw him step outside with Lafayette a little while ago.
Thanks.
( moaning, panting )
You incredible asshole!
- Get out of here.
- I am so sorry.
Really, James?
That's what you have to say?
That you are sorry?
Because need I remind you that I just found you fucking a man in our car.
- Jessica, please.
- Get the fuck out of my way.
Jess, will you please come outside and talk to me?
- Jason?
- Yeah, what's going on?
- Jessica, can we please talk about this?
- There is nothing to say.
Would you please rescind his invitation to this house?
What did he do?
What did you do?
I found him fucking Lafayette in the car that he and I bought together.
Get the fuck outta here, James.
( door slams )
- I should probably--
- Yeah, okay.
Go.
You all right?
Look, I just want to be alone right now.
Okay.
In case you need a place to crash, you know where I live.
( sighs )
You mean, with all that-- that sensitive musician shit, it never occurred to you that he might be gay?
I don't think that he is gay.
I think that he-- he's confused.
Jess, I gotta be honest with you.
Based on what you're telling me you saw him doing outside, it all sounds pretty gay to me.
- Oh, my God.
- ( knock on door )
- Who is it?
- Lafayette:
It's me.
Go away!
Look, Red, I know this shit got to hurt--
Don't you dare presume to know me.
You do not know the first thing about me.
And you don't know the first thing about him.
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you.
You know what?
When was he turned?
How was he turned?
Who turned him?
And where's he from back before he got turned?
Miss ma'am, you don't know any of this shit, do you?
I do because I cared enough to ask him and he cared enough to tell me.
Now, listen, I--
I know the way this shit went down is real embarrassing.
But if you keep it 100 with yourself and honest, then you know this is not the man for you.
Because he's the man for you?
If he is, what's so fucking unimaginable about that, Red?
Huh?
Everybody else in this fucking town is falling in love and getting engaged and having babies.
Has it ever fucking occurred to you that Lafayette, that queen that make all you white heterosexuals laugh and feel good about yourselves, has it fucking ever occurred to you that maybe I want a piece of happiness, too?
No.
( sighs )
James is a good man.
He's a vampire, Lafayette.
Whatever he is.
If you don't love him, let him go.
And I will take over from here.
- ( overlapping thoughts )
- I was wrong about that Sookie Stackhouse.
It wasn't her fault all this happened.
Hep-vamps were taking out town after town.
I feel so bad about all the things I said about her.
Her guy gave his life for her.
Lost the man she loved trying to save our town.
So pretty.
I wonder if I'd have the courage to do the same for the woman I love.
She's lost more people than anyone.
Here she is being hostess.
She's got a heart bigger than all of Louisiana.
- Willa:
Hey, Sookie.
- Hey.
You okay?
I'm drunk.
Oh, okay.
Well, you deserve to be.
Have you seen Arlene?
No, have-- have you seen Bill?
There's a safe house just on the other side of the bridge.
That's good people.
They'll give us food, shelter for the night... get our strength up... so we can keep going north come mornin'.
( horse neighs )
Shh, get down.
Everybody down.
- Man:
Keep going!
- Man #2:
All right, come on.
( baby crying )
- Shh, shh, shh.
- ( crying continues )
Okay, they're gone.
We're safe.
You scared?
Yeah, I suppose I am.
All right, folks, it's gonna be all right.
We gots to keep moving, though.
- Man:
Let's go.
- We've come this far and we're almost- ( gunshot ) - ( horses neigh )
( baby crying )
Well, well, look who we have here.
You had no right to kill that man.
He was a good man.
- You had no goddamn right.
- Oh, actually, I do.
Now, if you would kindly hand over that map.
Do it!
( baby continues crying )
Hey.
Hey!
- ( hammer clicks )
- No!
- No!
No!
- Get out of the way, Caroline!
Please, Charles, I beg of you!
Please think of the children!
( groans )
- ( yells ) - ( rifle fires )
You let that man serve as a warning of what we do to any and all deserters, no matter what their color.
Hyah!
( continues crying )
Bill?
I'm coming out.
Is it safe?
Yeah, it's safe, Sookie.
You don't look quite right.
Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
I'm just thinkin' is all.
- Well, then, stop.
The whole point of this celebration is so that we don't sit around here with long faces.
( chuckles )
You haven't socialized at all tonight.
I know everyone's pleased to see you here.
No, they're pleased to see you, Sookie.
You've done well.
You've done more these last several days than I've managed to achieve in decades.
Mainstream.
- ( music playing ) - ( chatter )
- I didn't do this.
- Yeah, you did.
Well...
I've had a lovely evening.
You can't leave yet.
No, I should be on my way.
But I had a wonderful time.
But I must admit this concept of men and women being friends was a little bit foreign in my day.
- Bill?
- Yeah?
Thank you.
For what?
For seeing me the way I can't see myself sometimes.
Come on.
Good night, Bill.
Good night, Sookie.
Woman thinking:
Look at her smilin' like that, how she lights up the room.
Lettie Mae thinking:
Heard Willa was here.
Can't figure out what my Tara's trying to tell me unless I get me some of Willa's blood.
Don't care if I have to stab her to get it.
Where's Willa?
Hey, where's Willa?
Who the fuck's Willa?
Dance with me.
No.
Willa!
( slurred ) Sugar, I've had a little too much to drink so you're gonna just have to get to the point.
Willa:
Okay, since Eric released me,
I need a job, so I was wondering if maybe I could be a waitress--
Lettie Mae, stop!
- ( screams )
- What the fuck?
!
( grunts )
- ( vampires hiss ) - ( screams )
Get back!
Get the fuck back!
- I'm okay, I'm okay.
- Sam:
She's okay.
She's okay, y'all.
Put your fangs away.
Lafayette:
What the hell's goings on here?
Lettie Mae stabbed Willa.
Of course she did.
What the fuck, Auntie?
Tara has been trying to contact me from the other side.
She's stuck, and the only way I can find out what she needs is with Willa's blood.
Come on before you get killed.
Come on, come on.
You're all looking at me like I'm crazy, but it's only because I used to have a drinking problem that people don't believe me!
You stabbed somebody, Auntie!
That's why people think you crazy.
Come on.
You're all fucking crazy, if you ask me.
What the fuck are we doing here, huh?
When just three days ago a group of rabid vampires came and attacked the town and killed a bunch of people and kidnapped us, right?
Arlene, Jane, Holly, and I, we were fucking chained in a dungeon and we--
( quietly ) Let's go to another room and talk about this.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
- Yes.
No, no, Sam.
No!
I know you don't want to hear this, but it needs to be said 'cause it's real.
Damn it, people are dead, people are traumatized, and the reaction you all have to this is to throw a party?
You fucking kidding me?
Now, I ain't for stabbing people, but at least Lettie Mae gets it.
Shit, I mean, you all are going on like this shit's normal and it's not.
This shit doesn't happen in other towns.
- Take me home.
I wanna go home.
- Okay.
- I wanna go home.
- Okay, okay.
- Here's your knife.
- Thanks.
Hey, I'm gonna make sure they get home safe.
Thanks, Violet.
I don't know.
Maybe Lafayette is right.
- What about?
- James and I.
Maybe we don't belong together.
You did meet in a prison camp, Jess.
Careful, Jason.
You know, people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
I see your point.
Yeah, Violet.
She's pretty weird, ain't she?
I mean, she's-- she's ancient and sexy as hell, but she's a little...
- Off?
- Yeah. ( chuckles )
She's way the fuck off sometimes.
You think maybe that's why...
No, why what?
We're supposed to be talking about you, Jess.
Yeah, I don't really feel like thinking about me anymore.
Go on, what?
Well, okay, then.
It was like earlier tonight when we were digging in trying to find Gran's ring to give it to Andy,
Violet was like, "I don't need a ring to prove to the world that you are mine."
( chuckles )
All I kept thinking was, "Jesus, please.
Sweet baby Jesus, put that ring on Holly's finger before it winds up on Violet's."
I mean, that was my Gran's ring, Jess.
It meant a lot that she wanted to give that to me.
Hell, man, I would love to have put it on someone one day.
But if that someone had to be Violet...
I don't know.
- Oh, Jason.
- What?
I think you might just be the sweetest man in the world.
( gasps )
( music playing )
Pam:
Of all the horrible things I've seen in the last 100 years, this could be the most disturbing.
Yeah.
Oh, come on.
It's fun because we're together.
No, it isn't.
What do Mommy and Daddy look like again?
Ah.
( laughs )
Pam:
Someone's having a good time.
You think Daddy'd be enjoying himself this much if Sarah got to him first?
I'll get him alone.
You mingle, find the mother.
How?
All these bitches look the same.
( chuckles )
- Mommy?
- ( gasps )
Oh, my God.
Hi, Mommy.
Sarah, what in he--
The whole world is looking for you.
What are you doing here?
Have you lost your ever-lovin' mind?
Oh, my God.
I missed you so much.
You look so pretty in that suit.
I forgot how beautiful you were.
What do you want?
And what have you done to your hair?
I'm in trouble.
Well, no shit, baby girl.
No, I mean real trouble.
And I need help from someone high up.
Someone powerful, right here, right now.
Is Laura Bush out there?
No, she is not.
Well, can you call her?
Sarah, Laura stopped taking my calls just about the time that that book came out claiming that my daughter is the monster who created the monsters who are scaring the shit out of half the country.
Now, is that true?
Yes.
But I'm not a monster.
I'm a Buddhist.
What?
Look, you have got to get out of here.
If the liberal media finds out that you are at this event, they are never gonna let you be--
No, Mommy, stop.
Listen very closely.
The Yakuza are after me.
Oh, darlin'.
( panting )
( moaning )
( panting, moaning continue )
( chatter )
Paul?
I need to ask you some questions about your daughter.
Has she come to see you?
( screams )
( crowd screaming )
( gunshots )
( both scream )
- The Yakuza?
- Uh-huh.
- Go, move!
Get out!
- ( screaming, shouting )
- Where is your daughter?
- I don't know!
- ( panting ) - ( automatic gunfire )
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
( panting )
- Come on!
- Go on, baby!
( screams )
( gasps )
( choking )
( grunting )
( inhales )
What are you doing out here, my love?
Someday soon you'll be buried here, too.
I don't want to fight.
But I don't see a way out.
- Do you?
- No.
I have loved you since the very first time I ever saw you.
( chuckles )
Long back as I can remember.
You are my first and only true love.
And you are mine.
I will survive this war, Caroline.
And when it's all over, I will come back to you... and to the children.
I promise you.

I don't give a shit!
I am not going with you.
I would rather die than get in that coffin!
You will do what your maker tells you to do.
He may be my maker, but he sure as fuck didn't raise me.
Tara did.
She was the one who taught me how to feed, how to control my impulses.
He left, and then you left her when we needed you most.
We have bigger fucking problems than your mommy and your daddy...
- She died because of you!
- I am sorry...
Enough!
You're right.
I've been a terrible maker to you.
And for that I am truly sorry.
But I do not regret turning you, and I'm proud to call you my progeny.
Why did you come back for me?
Pam and I are gonna kill Sarah Newlin before I meet the true death.
You can count me out.
She was practically your stepmother, Willa.
If you have any idea where she might be,
I need to know it.
- I'm not going with you.
- Like fuck you aren't.
But I will tell you what I know if you release me.
Willa Burrell,
I renounce the ties of our blood and my dominion over you as my progeny.
As your maker...
I release you.
Like being kicked in the cooch by a wallaby, isn't it?
Sarah has a sister.
Oh, no shit, Willa.
The whole world knows that.
- You'd better know more.
- Her name is Amber.
Amber Mills.
And she's a vampire.
Oh.
How the fuck could Sarah Newlin have a vampire sister and the world not know about it?
I don't know, but I overheard her one night on the phone at the governor's mansion.
Sarah was warning her never to call there again or my father would send her to camp.
Any idea where this Amber lives?
The call came from a Dallas area code.
Good girl.
Ginger?
Tell the driver we're heading for Dallas.
And we'll only be needing two travel coffins.
What?
No!
You just got back.
And if you walk out that door,
I ain't never gonna see you again, am I?
Take me with you.
Put me in the third coffin.
- Sorry.
- What... you're sorry?
I have been your sex slave for 15 years, Eric Northman, and we ain't never had sex.
Blow job, hand job, nothing.
Do you know what a sex slave is without the sex?
A slave?
Now, you are taking me with you to Dallas.
And if you can't fucking take me, then you had better fuckin' fuck me before you go.
Ginger, I'm diseased.
So the fuck am I!
No!
Sook?
Hey.
Hey.
I came as soon as I heard.
Ab... about Alcide?
About everything.
How is you holding up?
The house is so empty.
Well, that big man of yours did take up a lot of space.
- Sorry.
- No, I'm sorry, Sook.
I gotta clean up.
- Jackson will be here in the morning.
- No, don't worry about that.
- We'll take care of this.
- No, what you need is some sleep.
When's the last time you got some serious shut-eye?
Come on, let me put you to bed.
Lafayette?
Yes, ma'am?
Don't leave.
Sook, I will be here when you wake up.
So don't fret, 'kay?
Night-night.
What the hell?
Look who's up.
- Where's all his...
- In the truck.
When Alcide's mama died, the hardest part was going through all her things.
You just say when you wanna go through it all, when you feel you're ready, and Jenny and me will have you out to the place and we'll figure it all out.
Yeah, we'll figure it out.
Hey!
The undead has arisen.
- Hey, there, Sookie.
- How'd you sleep?
Lafayette, you wanna tell me why there's enough food to choke a horse on my dining room table?
Child, me and Jenny was bustin' our humps cooking' all the livelong day.
Well, that's...
that's real sweet, but I can't eat all this.
There's enough food here to feed the whole town off of.
Well... the whole town will be here.
- What?
- Uh-huh.
Wait, are... are y'all throwing a party?
- Yeah!
- Sookie, come on.
In my house?
The day after...
I know what you're probably thinking, honey.
But death doesn't have to be such a sad thing.
Actually, it does.
Death is inherently sad.
I'm sad.
I'm not in the mood for a party.
Sook.
Sook!
Sook, what did you say last night when you came home?
About how this house was feeling so empty?
That's why we're gonna fill it up, so we can say "fuck you," to death and "hello," to life.
- Yeah.
- And that's what we're doing.
We are motherfucking celebrating life.
I'm going back to sleep.
What would Tara want?
What would Alcide want?
Alcide would want people to be around you tonight, Sookie.
Yes, ma'am, so take that pretty little ass of yours upstairs and get presentable.
'Cause folk gonna be here soon with some top-shelf alcohol, and I got one restriction... not a nan person come up to you and say, "Oh, I'm sorry for your loss."
Mm-mm, none of that bullshit.
- Hear, hear, I say.
- That's right.
Come on, hooker.
Let's bring out the rest of the vittles and bits.
And that chicken Jenny made.
- It ain't as good as mine.
Sookie?
Ugh, this is not happening.
- Am I early?
- Why, do I not look ready?
You know what, actually, best not answer that.
I only just now found out about the party I'm hosting tonight.
I see.
Um...
I didn't have any alcohol on hand, as requested.
My mother always taught me it was ungentlemanly to turn up to a gathering empty-handed, so, uh, I brought you these.
Well, I guess I'd better go upstairs and put my face on, but in the meantime, I invite you in.
Amber Mills?
Who are you?
I was always the black sheep of the family.
Started fangbanging right outta high school while Little Miss Perfect's marrying Steven Newlin.
She's not here.
Just like I told you she wasn't.
We had to be sure.
Your boyfriend?
Jeremy.
He was the one that turned me.
He helped me get my shit together.
But the second I turn, Sarah freaks.
She's married into the Fellowship of the Sun, after all.
But she knows I'm broke, so she starts paying me off, a monthly cash delivery to stay in the coffin.
Then she goes out and she tells the world that her sister was taken from her by those evil vampires, that I disappeared into thin air.
But I was here the whole time.
Jeremy and me sittin' around watching "House Hunters" marathons and drinkin' Tru Blood.
What happened to Jeremy?
Same thing that's happening to us.
One day, he gets the veins.
A few months later, he's dying in my arms.
Sometimes I beat myself up over it.
I mean, if I hadn't taken her money, if I had come out instead of hiding...
She would've had you killed and kept on walking.
None of this is your fault.
It's your sister's, which is why Pam and I are going after her.
And will you help us find her?
Are you gonna kill her?
There's a real good chance that's the way it's gonna go down.
Then you can count me in.
Mm.
I like her.
I like you.
Is it all right if I haven't made up my mind about you yet?
Yeah, I really like her.
When's the last time you saw Sarah?
Oh, it's been years now.
But she did call here this morning.
She said she just got to Dallas and she needed a place to hide.
I told her to fuck off.
She's in Dallas.
Any idea where else she might've gone?
Where she always goes, to Mommy and Daddy.
Even though she disgraced the family, they always fall for her BS.
And where do Mommy and Daddy live?
Why, Preston Hollow, of course.
But they won't be home tonight.
Probably already left for this.
The second I told her that's where Mommy and Daddy were going, she hung up.
She'll be there.
Looks like we're going to a gala.
Do you have a picture of your parents I can borrow?
You'll never get in.
You're vampires.
Security's gonna be tight and they only invited assholes.
You don't know us, sweetheart.
We can be assholes.
I want to go.
I want to say good-bye to my girl.
But there's gonna be alcohol and vampires at Sookie's.
Know how you're always saying that eyes are the windows to the soul?
Lettie Mae, please.
Look into mine.
I ain't going to that party looking for no vamper blood.
I just want to say good-bye 'cause there won't be no grave in no cemetery where I can visit my Tara.
Ain't nothing left of her to bury.
I'm so sorry, sweetheart, but no.
No, no, I have to do what's best for you whether you like it or not.
Now, look, let me take care of you tonight.
Please.
All right?
All right.
Now, come on, give me a taste, 'cause I wanna make this just how you like it.
Come on.
Needs cumin.
Okay, all right, I'll...
- Hi!
- Hi, girls!
- Bring it in, honky.
- Hey.
Well, ladies, we dodged a bullet!
- Yeah, we did.
- Whoo!
Amazing what a little shut-eye can do to calm the nerves.
- You know what, girls?
- Hmm?
After what we all went through,
I'm gonna make some major changes in my life,
- clean up my act.
- That is great, Jane.
I'm gonna finally get my shit together.
- Good for you, girl.
- Amen.
Yeah.
Starting tomorrow.
I'm starting tomorrow, too, okay?
- To not dyin'.
- Amen.
If anyone knows how to live it up, it's you, Jane Bodehouse.
Minus.
Mr. Compton.
I ain't seen you since your daddy died.
It's good to see you, Minus.
What's going on?
Why's everyone goin'...
What's going on, William Compton... is that Lincoln has called his soldiers.
Called his soldiers?
Charles, are you saying...
That's right, William, war.
Everyone's going to enlist.
Based on our education and you and me being from prominent families, we're all but guaranteed to be made commissioned officers.
Isn't that thrilling'?
It is our God-given right to live our lives as we see fit,
- without interference.
- Yeah!
And I, for one, am willing to do whatever it takes to lay down my life if necessary to preserve that God-given right.
Are we gonna let a bunch of Yankee cowards come on down here and take our freedoms?
- Huh?
- No!
Then it is the sovereign right of the state of Louisiana to secede from the union.
Mr. DuPont's right.
Fort Sumter was just the beginning.
Yeah!
You see, we cannot, we must not let them destroy our way of life.
We have no choice but to fight.
Yeah!
With what?
This is a lost cause.
The Yankees have better artillery.
More sophisticated weaponry than we do.
What they will destroy is our town, scorch our land, our livelihoods.
Get outta my bar, William Compton.
We got no room here for Yankee sympathizers.
I'm sorry if you find the truth offensive, Mr. Bodehouse.
- Get out!
Go ahead!
To not dyin'.
Hey, Sook.
You look real pretty.
Thanks, so do you.
Yeah, yeah, I have to admit finally getting a chance to shower up makes all the difference.
I was talking to Violet.
Oh.
Tsk.
Oh, Sookie, my sister.
Oh, I know we're not supposed to say we're sorry for your loss, but I am so very sorry.
I've had about a hundred boyfriends die on me over the years, but I remember how painful those first ones were.
There you are, Sookie.
You look like you could do with something eat.
I hear there are two kinds of chicken to try.
Excuse us.
What?
"I've had about a hundred boyfriends die on me, but I..."
Shut up and come dance with me.
Alcide could be an arrogant little shit, even when he was a kid.
You'd tell him to go left and he'd go right just to piss you off.
He'd question everything.
Now, fightin', it's a way of life where we come from, but Alcide, he wouldn't fight just for the sake of fighting'.
In fact, he told me once, "I'll fight when I'm good and ready.
I'll fight when I have something worth fighting for."
You were worth it, Sookie.
Otherwise he wouldn't have fought for you.
My boy died a hero.
But you can't die a hero without having a righteous cause.
Thank you.
To Alcide.
To Alcide.
- To Alcide.
- Alcide.
'Scuse me.
Uh-uh, no, Lettie Mae.
You can't come up in here causing no scene.
- Mm-mm.
- I am so sorry for your loss.
Lettie Mae.
You wanna say a few words about Tara?
First off, I'd like to say my heart goes out to you, Mr. Herveaux.
I'm sad for you, but I'm also glad for you because your son died a hero.
My Tara was a hero, too.
Most of you know I made some big mistakes raising her.
Most of you know I didn't raise her, that's 'cause you did...
her friends.
Still, though, she sacrificed herself trying to save me, even after all the pain I caused her.
And that's just beyond heroic in my book.
So I want to ask you to join me in raising a glass to her.
You got anything non-alcoholic?
Yeah.
Here you go.
Thank you, Deputy.
To my baby girl.
- To Tara.
- To Tara.
Thank you.
How's the party?
You should come inside.
I'm fine.
- Jessica...
- Andy.
I can't.
Did it ever occur to you that you torturing yourself over my girls keeps that pain alive for me, too?
You ever think about that?
This has been a hell of a week we're having, but during it you have been there.
You have been good to Adilyn.
You helped bring Holly back to me and her boys.
I don't know if I'm supposed to be taking some kind of message from all this bullshit that's been going on, but I'm taking one anyhow.
Life's too short.
Jessica, it's too fucking precious to always be looking backwards.
I'm moving forwards.
But I'm gonna need your help to do that.
How can I help?
You got a ring I can borrow?
A ring, but... oh, my God.
Are you gonna propose to Holly tonight?
Please don't make this a bigger deal than it already is.
But it is a big deal.
I know that!
Jesus Christ, I'm freakin' out inside.
Just give me a ring before I change my mind.
Andy, you can't propose to Holly with any of these.
Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?
I ain't exactly had time to go to the mall.
Come on.
Wait up!
Are you sure you don't mind me borrowing it, Sookie?
Not at all.
Gran would've loved Holly.
Although she did leave it to Jason to give to the woman he was gonna marry.
That's right, she did.
You're already mine, Jason.
I don't need a ring to tell me that.
Well, here it is.
Oh, my God.
It's beautiful.
That's it?
Holy crap, I'm really gonna do this, huh?
Andy, you got yourself a real good woman, man.
It's all yours.
You seen your mother?
Uh, pretty sure she's in the living room.
Y'all are gonna wanna see this.
Oh, come here.
A little word to the wise.
I don't know if the two of you are fuckin' or not, but if you are, it's gonna have to stop right now.
You got it?
What's up?
Oh, you're bad.
Andy?
Andy, what's wrong?
Could we kill the music, please?
On it.
Andy, oh, my God.
What are you doing?
Holly, I...
I'm...
I don't know...
I...
I can't...
I don't know what I'm about to say, but I have been waiting for the perfect moment to do this, but something keeps getting in the way.
It wasn't until you went missing that I realized that something this whole time, was me.
See, I got this voice in my head that says I don't deserve a woman as beautiful as you are.
I don't deserve a woman as kind as you are.
And I probably don't, but...
I know the timing's weird and you got all kinds of healing to do.
- Oh.
- But, please... wear this ring for me?
I'll go through all of it with ya every step of the way.
Yes!
Aw!
I didn't ask you yet.
You gotta let me ask you.
Oh, I'm sorry.
Sorry.
Jumped the gun.
Uh, Holly Cleary, I love you with everything I got.
Will you marry me?
That's lovely, man.
I love you, Andy!
Let's go congratulate 'em.
Yeah.
- Hey.
- What?
What?
- You just seem happy is all.
- Well, I am.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Seriously?
Now?
Yeah, it's been a while since...
I know, but we're at...
we're at a party.
Okay?
Don't be such a wet blanket.
Just try to have fun and we'll leave later, okay?
Oh, man, what a surprise.
You doing okay?
Yeah.
You fixing' to cry?
I think I might be.
Come on, let's sneak upstairs.
Don't get me wrong, I am so happy for Andy and Holly.
It's just a little bit more of a celebration of life than I was ready for.
You miss him?
How can I miss someone I can't even believe is dead?
Alcide dying's a bit of a shock, sweetie.
That's the thing.
It never occurred to me that Alcide could die.
He's just... so... so big and strong and he just...
It don't matter how big or strong someone is if someone else has a gun.
It was the same way with Terry.
It happened so fast, came out of nowhere.
The thing is, though, when it comes to loving a man and then losing him, it doesn't matter how it happens 'cause he's still gone.
You still have that hole inside you and it hurts just the same no matter how prepared you are for it or not.
When Terry died,
I thought I was gonna die right along with him.
How did you get through it?
At night, when no one was lookin'... sometimes I'd put his jacket on just so I could feel his arms around me again.
You never get over the loss of someone you love.
You just learn to live with it.
And nothing's gonna help heal this pain you're feeling but time.
And tequila.
How about a little tequila?
There's not enough tequila in the world to get me through tonight.
"Wet blanket"?
Do she even know who you is?
She gives me just enough love.
Mm.
And just enough affection to keep me hooked.
That's just like paying the minimum on your credit card bill each month just to keep that fucker from getting cancelled.
That's exactly what it's like.
Mm.
Jesus Christ, am I that fucking simple?
No, sir.
There's nothing simple about you at all.
The night we met, remember that story you told me about how you was turned?
Mm-hmm.
Can I ask a follow-up question?
Of course.
Danny Monoghan.
What about him?
Was y'all...
Yeah.
I told the sales woman my wife and I were going to an exclusive high society event and that only the very best would do.
Voilà.
Oh, my God.
I'm a republi-cunt.
- You think that's funny, huh?
- Mm-hmm.
Wait till you see what that nice man at Neiman's and I picked out for you.
Strip.
Oh, fuck, Eric.
You're stage two.
Just cover the ones that will be visible.
Okay.
I'm gonna die, Pam.
You have to accept that.
Whoo!
- My God, there he is.
- There who is?
That vampire who gave me his blood.
He's been making eyes at me ever since he got here.
- Evening, Arlene.
- Hey, Keith.
Um, Arlene here is super grateful on account of you, you know, saving her life last night and all, but she's been through a lot, so you might wanna,
I don't know, dial down your sexy a notch.
I understand.
And I can wait.
Sookie, would you please tell your friend Arlene here that I think she's the most beautiful woman I've seen in over 300 years?
And I'll see her in her dreams.
Um...
I have to go make tinkle because, you know, I am a human.
Arlene, have you seen James?
Huh?
James...
have you seen him?
I've been looking everywhere.
I think I saw him step outside with Lafayette a little while ago.
Thanks.
You incredible asshole!
- Get out of here.
- I am so sorry.
Really, James?
That's what you have to say?
That you are sorry?
Because need I remind you that I just found you fucking a man in our car.
- Jessica, please.
- Get the fuck out of my way.
Jess, will you please come outside and talk to me?
- Jason?
- Yeah, what's going on?
- Jessica, can we please talk about this?
- There is nothing to say.
Would you please rescind his invitation to this house?
What did he do?
What did you do?
I found him fucking Lafayette in the car that he and I bought together.
Get the fuck outta here, James.
- I should probably...
- Yeah, okay.
Go.
You all right?
Look, I just want to be alone right now.
Okay.
In case you need a place to crash, you know where I live.
You mean, with all that... that sensitive musician shit, it never occurred to you that he might be gay?
I don't think that he is gay.
I think that he...
he's confused.
Jess, I gotta be honest with you.
Based on what you're telling me you saw him doing outside, it all sounds pretty gay to me.
Oh, my God.
- Who is it?
- It's me.
Go away!
Look, Red, I know this shit got to hurt...
Don't you dare presume to know me.
You do not know the first thing about me.
And you don't know the first thing about him.
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you.
You know what?
When was he turned?
How was he turned?
Who turned him?
And where's he from back before he got turned?
Miss ma'am, you don't know any of this shit, do you?
I do because I cared enough to ask him and he cared enough to tell me.
Now, listen, I...
I know the way this shit went down is real embarrassing.
But if you keep it 100 with yourself and honest, then you know this is not the man for you.
Because he's the man for you?
If he is, what's so fucking unimaginable about that, Red?
Huh?
Everybody else in this fucking town is falling in love and getting engaged and having babies.
Has it ever fucking occurred to you that Lafayette, that queen that make all you white heterosexuals laugh and feel good about yourselves, has it fucking ever occurred to you that maybe I want a piece of happiness, too?
No.
James is a good man.
He's a vampire, Lafayette.
Whatever he is.
If you don't love him, let him go.
And I will take over from here.
I was wrong about that Sookie Stackhouse.
It wasn't her fault all this happened.
Hep-vamps were taking out town after town.
I feel so bad about all the things I said about her.
Her guy gave his life for her.
Lost the man she loved trying to save our town.
So pretty.
I wonder if I'd have the courage to do the same for the woman I love.
She's lost more people than anyone.
Here she is being hostess.
She's got a heart bigger than all of Louisiana.
- Hey, Sookie.
- Hey.
You okay?
I'm drunk.
Oh, okay.
Well, you deserve to be.
Have you seen Arlene?
No, have...
have you seen Bill?
There's a safe house just on the other side of the bridge.
That's good people.
They'll give us food, shelter for the night... get our strength up... so we can keep going north come mornin'.
Shh, get down.
Everybody down.
- Keep going!
- All right, come on.
Shh, shh, shh.
Okay, they're gone.
We're safe.
You scared?
Yeah, I suppose I am.
All right, folks, it's gonna be all right.
We gots to keep moving, though.
- Let's go.
- We've come this far and we're almost...
Well, well, look who we have here.
You had no right to kill that man.
He was a good man.
- You had no goddamn right.
- Oh, actually, I do.
Now, if you would kindly hand over that map.
Do it!
Hey.
Hey!
No!
- No!
No!
- Get out of the way, Caroline!
Please, Charles, I beg of you!
Please think of the children!
You let that man serve as a warning of what we do to any and all deserters, no matter what their color.
Hyah!
Bill?
I'm coming out.
Is it safe?
Yeah, it's safe, Sookie.
You don't look quite right.
Are you okay?
- I'm fine.
I'm just thinkin' is all.
- Well, then, stop.
The whole point of this celebration is so that we don't sit around here with long faces.
You haven't socialized at all tonight.
I know everyone's pleased to see you here.
No, they're pleased to see you, Sookie.
You've done well.
You've done more these last several days than I've managed to achieve in decades.
Mainstream.
- I didn't do this.
- Yeah, you did.
Well...
I've had a lovely evening.
You can't leave yet.
No, I should be on my way.
But I had a wonderful time.
But I must admit this concept of men and women being friends was a little bit foreign in my day.
- Bill?
- Yeah?
Thank you.
For what?
For seeing me the way I can't see myself sometimes.
Come on.
Good night, Bill.
Good night, Sookie.
Look at her smilin' like that, how she lights up the room.
Heard Willa was here.
Can't figure out what my Tara's trying to tell me unless I get me some of Willa's blood.
Don't care if I have to stab her to get it.
Where's Willa?
Hey, where's Willa?
Who the fuck's Willa?
Dance with me.
No.
Willa!
Sugar, I've had a little too much to drink so you're gonna just have to get to the point.
Okay, since Eric released me,
I need a job, so I was wondering if maybe I could be a waitress...
Lettie Mae, stop!
What the fuck?
!
Get back!
Get the fuck back!
- I'm okay, I'm okay.
- She's okay.
She's okay, y'all.
Put your fangs away.
What the hell's goings on here?
Lettie Mae stabbed Willa.
Of course she did.
What the fuck, Auntie?
Tara has been trying to contact me from the other side.
She's stuck, and the only way I can find out what she needs is with Willa's blood.
Come on before you get killed.
Come on, come on.
You're all looking at me like I'm crazy, but it's only because I used to have a drinking problem that people don't believe me!
You stabbed somebody, Auntie!
That's why people think you crazy.
Come on.
You're all fucking crazy, if you ask me.
What the fuck are we doing here, huh?
When just three days ago a group of rabid vampires came and attacked the town and killed a bunch of people and kidnapped us, right?
Arlene, Jane, Holly, and I, we were fucking chained in a dungeon and we...
Let's go to another room and talk about this.
- Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
- Yes.
No, no, Sam.
No!
I know you don't want to hear this, but it needs to be said 'cause it's real.
Damn it, people are dead, people are traumatized, and the reaction you all have to this is to throw a party?
You fucking kidding me?
Now, I ain't for stabbing people, but at least Lettie Mae gets it.
Shit, I mean, you all are going on like this shit's normal and it's not.
This shit doesn't happen in other towns.
- Take me home.
I wanna go home.
- Okay.
- I wanna go home.
- Okay, okay.
- Here's your knife.
- Thanks.
Hey, I'm gonna make sure they get home safe.
Thanks, Violet.
I don't know.
Maybe Lafayette is right.
- What about?
- James and I.
Maybe we don't belong together.
You did meet in a prison camp, Jess.
Careful, Jason.
You know, people in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.
I see your point.
Yeah, Violet.
She's pretty weird, ain't she?
I mean, she's... she's ancient and sexy as hell, but she's a little...
- Off?
- Yeah.
She's way the fuck off sometimes.
You think maybe that's why...
No, why what?
We're supposed to be talking about you, Jess.
Yeah, I don't really feel like thinking about me anymore.
Go on, what?
Well, okay, then.
It was like earlier tonight when we were digging in trying to find Gran's ring to give it to Andy,
Violet was like, "I don't need a ring to prove to the world that you are mine."
All I kept thinking was, "Jesus, please.
Sweet baby Jesus, put that ring on Holly's finger before it winds up on Violet's."
I mean, that was my Gran's ring, Jess.
It meant a lot that she wanted to give that to me.
Hell, man, I would love to have put it on someone one day.
But if that someone had to be Violet...
I don't know.
- Oh, Jason.
- What?
I think you might just be the sweetest man in the world.
Of all the horrible things I've seen in the last 100 years, this could be the most disturbing.
Yeah.
Oh, come on.
It's fun because we're together.
No, it isn't.
What do Mommy and Daddy look like again?
Ah.
Someone's having a good time.
You think Daddy'd be enjoying himself this much if Sarah got to him first?
I'll get him alone.
You mingle, find the mother.
How?
All these bitches look the same.
Mommy?
Oh, my God.
Hi, Mommy.
Sarah, what in he...
The whole world is looking for you.
What are you doing here?
Have you lost your ever-lovin' mind?
Oh, my God.
I missed you so much.
You look so pretty in that suit.
I forgot how beautiful you were.
What do you want?
And what have you done to your hair?
I'm in trouble.
Well, no shit, baby girl.
No, I mean real trouble.
And I need help from someone high up.
Someone powerful, right here, right now.
Is Laura Bush out there?
No, she is not.
Well, can you call her?
Sarah, Laura stopped taking my calls just about the time that that book came out claiming that my daughter is the monster who created the monsters who are scaring the shit out of half the country.
Now, is that true?
Yes.
But I'm not a monster.
I'm a Buddhist.
What?
Look, you have got to get out of here.
If the liberal media finds out that you are at this event, they are never gonna let you be...
No, Mommy, stop.
Listen very closely.
The Yakuza are after me.
Oh, darlin'.
Paul?
I need to ask you some questions about your daughter.
Has she come to see you?
- The Yakuza?
- Uh-huh.
Go, move!
Get out!
- Where is your daughter?
- I don't know!
Come on!
Come on!
Come on!
- Come on!
- Go on, baby!
What are you doing out here, my love?
Someday soon you'll be buried here, too.
I don't want to fight.
But I don't see a way out.
- Do you?
- No.
I have loved you since the very first time I ever saw you.
Long back as I can remember.
You are my first and only true love.
And you are mine.
I will survive this war, Caroline.
And when it's all over, I will come back to you... and to the children.
I promise you.
Really?
Eric!
Eric!
Time until dawn.
Our first sunrise together.

Madeline Kapneck's office.
Yes, I-
- I need to make an appointment, please.
October?
I'm sorry, but that's-- that's not acceptable.
I don't know how much time I have.
Well, I've just-- I'm Hep-V positive, and it's very important to me that I get my affairs in order, my estate, my will.
Yes.
I see.
I see.
No.
So you're saying that my only recourse is to come in and wait?
Yes.
All right.
I'm on my way.
Thank you for your help.
Bill?
Jess, hi.
Hi.
You have a good time at the party?
Uh, yeah, I guess I had--
I had an okay time.
James come back with you?
Um, uh, no.
Why not?
He and I-- we had kind of a fight.
Well, sorry to hear that, but I'm sure you two will work it out.
I don't know.
It was kind of a big fight.
Oh.
Well, I'm sorry, but I have to go out for a while.
I don't know what time I'll be back, so don't wait up for me, okay?
Bill?
Are you okay?
I'm fine.
See you later.
Okay.
I gotta be gettin' home.
- The reverend will be waiting up for me.
- That's bullshit, Auntie.
With all that Benadryl you doped him with, he gonna be out for days.
I'm not letting you out of my sight.
- Hey.
- Hey.
Is it all right if I stay here tonight?
Sure thing.
Thank you.
Lettie Mae, this is James.
James, this is Lettie Mae.
- Hi.
- Now, James is a vampire.
Don't be gettin' no bright ideas of taking a cleaver to him in the middle of the day.
I know you think it's my disease talkin', but I swear Tara's got something she wants to say to me and I need vampire blood to be able to hear her.
I got enough of your crazy for tonight, Auntie.
I'll give you my blood.
What?
I know you got a good heart, boyfriend, but don't let this woman snow you.
She's an addict.
Look, we both know that substances can elevate your consciousness.
What if Tara is trying to talk to her?
That vampire's making sense, Lafayette.
Fine.
But I'll do it with you this one last time, and then we're gonna have to pu some closure on this bitch.
Because after tonight, I'm closing this shit down.
You get me?
There's a storm cellar.
Light tight.
Enjoy the ride.
Violet?
Hey, baby.
Hey.
You just-- you just left.
You didn't wait for me.
I wanted to surprise you.
Oh.
Well...
I'm surprised.
Yeah.
You feeling okay?
I just wanted to show you how much I appreciate you.
I know I can be a little... aggressive sometimes.
Oh.
But that's because I come from a different time where that approach to life was necessary.
But now I live in this time.
And I want to make sure that you feel appreciated.
Mm.
And that you feel... like you're in control.
Yeah, well, uh...
I do feel appreciated, and-- and, you know, uh, in... control?
When I tell you that you're mine...
I realized I forgot to tell you... that I'm yours.
Mmm.
- Here you go, ma'am.
Watch your step.
- Okay.
I'm here to see Ms. Kapneck.
Take a number, please.
Do you have any kind of estimated wait time?
Five to seven hours.
Well, that'll take us into daylight.
Anubis is running taxis.
But I drove here.
They'll drive your car home for an additional fee.
196.
This is bullshit.
I imagined my death many times, but I never thought I'd meet the sun in someplace with wall-to-wall carpet.
Howdy, Mr. Northman, Ms. De Beauford.
My name is Katsurou Ryouichi, but my friends call me Mr. Gus, Jr.
Now, I'm the North American president of Yokonomo Corporation, an honor bestowed on me by my father Mr. Gus, Sr., president of Yokonomo Corporation.
Now, our signature product, as I'm sure you're aware, is Tru Blood.
But now Yokonomo Corporation is bankrupt and I am North American president of, well, shit-- shit blood.
Now this is a deep fumeiyo.
A dishonor.
Now, I require your assistance to take a small step to rectify this situation.
Do you know this woman, Sarah Newlin?
Uh, yeah, I know of her.
You know where she is?
No.
Do you have any information that could lead us to Sarah Newlin?
No.
That is unfortunate because the sun is gonna rise in the east in three minutes and you'll be frying like eggs on Texas asphalt.
So I will ask again.
Where is Sarah Newlin?
I have no idea.
- Eric.
- Shut up, Pam.
Ms. De Beauford, do you have any information that could lead us to the whereabouts of Sarah Newlin?
Pam.
Why don't you take these chains off and we'll talk?
Don't you think the machete is overkill?
Two minutes.
Don't do it.
He's gonna take the information and then kill us anyway.
Give us your word.
If your fuckin' honor's so important to you, give us your word on your honor that you won't kill us if we tell you what you wanna know.
You have my word.
One more condition.
I will be the one to kill Sarah Newlin.
No.
Non-negotiable.
Oh, who gives a shit who deals the death blow?
Dead is dead.
Sarah Newlin destroyed my company, my product.
She will reap my retribution.
Sarah Newlin killed my sister.
And when I find her, I'm gonna wrap my hands around her neck and snap her little blond bobblehead right off.
Eric, stand the fuck down.
And you, shut the fuck up about your stupid corporation.
Sarah Newlin's gonna be having the last fuckin' laugh, shopping at Barney's and having a manicure if you two can't stop measuring your dicks and make a fuckin' deal.
I kill her.
You can have the body.
Deal.
Sarah Newlin has a vampire sister who lives here in Dallas.
With their mommy and daddy dead,
Sarah will have no place else to run.
The address?
When night falls, we'll go together.
Unchain them.
- Amber, it's me!
It's Sarah!
- Oh, I know it's you.
You're still wearing that fucking Chanel No. 5.
Please, please don't kill me!
Oh, my God.
Oh, Jesus, you're sick.
Fuck you.
You did this to me.
No.
No.
- Yeah?
- Jason?
Hey, you okay?
Um, no, I'm not really that okay.
Hold on.
What's wrong?
If it's-- if it's about last night--
No, uh, no, no.
It's not about that.
Um...
I need you to go get Sookie.
I need you to bring her over here right now.
W-why?
I can't really say over the phone.
I think it's got to be in person.
- You can't say what?
- Please, just go and get her?
Can you just do that for me, please?
- It's really important.
- Okay.
Be there as soon as I can.
Shit, shit, shit.
Fuck!
- Adilyn, honey, you all-- whoa!
- Daddy!
- Oh, shit!
Oh, shit!
- You fuckin' little pissant cocksucker!
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- Daddy, no!
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- No, no, no, no!
I'm gonna wring your neck, you little chickenshit!
Daddy, no!
- Come back here, you fucking dipshit!
- Andy...
- Goddamn fuckin' turd!
- What the hell?
Get back here!
- Shit!
- Oh, no!
- Andy, what the fuck?
- Daddy, no!
You stay away from Adilyn
- if you know what's good for you!
- I love her!
Andy Bellefleur, don't you dare talk to my son that way.
Are you okay, baby?
Are you hurt?
What in the Sam Hill is goin' on?
- You're gonna wake the baby.
- Did you hit my son?
Oh, you better have not hit my son, Andy, so help me, God.
I didn't hit him, but I should have.
I love you, too!
You, get upstairs.
I'll deal with you later, young lady.
- Daddy.
- Now, Adilyn!
I'm taking Wade home, and then I will deal with you later!
Come on, baby.
Sookie?
Fuck.
Sook!
Are you decent?
Hey, Sook.
Wake up.
Wake up.
Hey, I've been calling you.
You're not answering your phone?
Your mailbox is full.
- Go away.
- Come on, let's get up.
Come on, we gotta go.
Why are you talking so loud?
Listen, Jessica called me.
She said I gotta bring you over to the Compton place.
She needs to tell you something.
There's this thing called a phone.
I know, but she needs to tell you it in person.
Now, let's go.
Come on.
- What's wrong?
- I don't know.
There are some woodpeckers moving into my frontal lobe.
It's like bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.
Put those on.
I'll make you some coffee.
- Sookie!
- Fuck.
- This way!
- I'm with you, Auntie.
What have they done to you, my baby?
How can I help you?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I know.
All right, look, I gotta go, Mom.
Yeah, I love you, too.
- Sam...
- Hey.
I'm going home.
Oh.
Okay.
Yeah, maybe that is a good idea.
Get out of town for a few days, see your folks.
No, it's not for a few days.
I am leaving for good.
- I don't belong here, Sam.
- Sure, you do, Nic.
Listen...
I can't begin to understand what you've been through, but I do know that you belong here.
- We belong here.
- No, no.
I do not belong here.
We do not belong here, Sam.
It wasn't until last night that I realized this town is fucking crazy, and you-- you're the mayor of crazy.
Now, I will not raise our daughter in this.
I won't.
So I'm leaving, and I am asking you to please come with me.
This is my home, Nicole.
I mean, I-- I looked around a lot of places.
Bon Temps is the only place I ever felt safe.
I know, baby.
And that's the craziest thing of all.
My mother is coming to get me tomorrow.
You think about it.
- Jess?
- Yeah, uh, come in.
Just close the door behind you, please.
Door's closed.
Hi.
Thank you for coming.
Okay.
What's going on?
It's, um-- it's Bill.
What about Bill?
I overheard him tell someone that he was Hep-V positive.
- What?
- No, that can't be.
We saw him last night.
He was fine.
I know, but that's what he said.
- What did you hear, exactly?
- He was on the phone.
He was talking to a lawyer's office or something and he was saying that he needed to come in and make arrangements for his estate and his will because he was Hep-V positive and he didn't know how much time he had.
Maybe he just wanted to get his will and stuff done because of all the crazy shit going on in the world.
Yeah, but he said that he was sick.
He said that he was Hep-V positive.
Okay, okay.
Let's just-- let's say for a minute that he is sick.
Bill Compton is one tough motherfucker.
He's gonna beat this thing.
I mean, hell, he was a bona fide vampire god about six months ago.
Okay.
Hey, we ain't giving up hope yet.
We don't even know if he's got it for sure.
- Jason.
- Yeah?
I need you to take me to the clinic.
- What?
- I've been exposed.
It ain't you, Sook.
You were negative just last week.
Even still...
I need to get tested again.
Can you just take me now, please?
Um, will you be okay for a while?
Yeah.
Come on, Sook.
Will you call me with the results?
Yeah.
Andy's calling again.
Oh, don't keep him in the dog house.
You two got yourselves a sticky situation.
You better deal with it quick before your grandkids are your step-grandkids, too.
- Bite your tongue.
- It's the birds and the bees, Holly.
It's the facts of fuckin' life.
Jesus.
Well, shit happens, Holly.
You clean it up.
I'm hungry.
We'll get you some blood when we get home.
These bands of H-vamps attacked another town.
The savages.
I'm sick, you don't see me doing this.
You say that now.
You're in the early stages still.
You don't know what you're gonna do when it gets bad.
261.
Dude, what the fuck?
I've never seen Hep-V do that before.
What stage are you in?
I only began to notice the symptoms last night.
Please extend your forefinger.
Here you go.
We will call you later on today with the results.
Nothing left to do but wait.
All right.
Well, let me take you home.
I don't wanna go home.
Well, where do you wanna go, then?
Don't know.
Just not home.
Tara!
This was our old house where we used to stay when Tara was a baby.
- What is she doing?
- I have no idea.
Baby, what's all this mean?
Lettie Mae!
Lettie Mae Thornton!
You've gone too far this time.
- Wake up!
Wake up!
- Hey, now, Rev!
- Hold up!
- Come on, baby.
Why'd you do that?
Why'd you take me away from her?
Tara was taking me home!
She was taking you straight to hell, woman.
- I don't think so.
- Oh, you stay out of this.
Listen, I thought Lettie Mae was full of shit, too.
That's why I went on that V trip with her, to prove her wrong.
But Tara-- Tara, she-- she brought us to their old house, the one at the South Ward.
We gotta go there.
That's where she wants us to go.
Shit, you're right.
She wanted us to see something there.
You're out of your mind, the both of you.
- You should see yourselves right now.
- No, we ain't.
- You gotta come with us.
- Why?
What does she want you to see?
I don't know yet, but that don't make it any less real.
- I'm sorry, honey, but it does.
- How many times you seen God?
- God doesn't show Himself.
You know that.
- Tara did.
The way I see it, there's more evidence of this Tara shit being real than God is.
Should I stop goin' to church, good preacher?
Son, you can do whatever the fuck you wanna do.
Now, move.
I love you, Lettie Mae.
I love you more than life itself.
But I cannot sit here and watch you do this to yourself.
So you're gonna have to choose-- it's the V or me.
I told you, it's not about the V.
It is to me.
Baby... my baby girl is trying to tell me something.
I ain't going to ignore it.
This is something I have to do.
Where's Holly?
Uh, she's in the back.
Now, Andy-- uh-uh.
I'm gonna need you to face this tiny hiccup with a cool head.
Holly's son was sticking it to my Adilyn underneath my roof.
Andy Bellefleur, you best change your tone if you know what's good for you.
Okay, listen up, you two.
Y'all are almost hitched.
Tying the big ol' knot.
And that's gonna mean for richer or poorer, in good times and bad times.
I don't think screwing your sibling's what they meant by "bad times."
Oh, okay, and why is it Wade's fault, huh?
I don't know what you're implying.
What are you implying there, lady?
I ain't implying anything, mister.
Everyone knows about fairies.
Are you calling my Adilyn a slut?
If the fairy shoe fits.
You take that back, Holly Cleary!
Okay, listen up, everybody.
Just shut up.
You hear me?
Shut your pie holes.
There is no use in pointing fingers and placing blame.
These two kids are teenagers.
They got hormones poppin' out everywhere hijacking' their brains.
It is a miracle they didn't sleep together sooner.
- That's not helping.
- Jesus.
I'm just saying these are good kids and they think they're in love, and you two bickering amongst each other ain't gonna solve your problem.
You gotta talk to 'em.
Y'all are fixin' to be a family now.
Well...
I am sorry I called Adilyn a slut.
I don't even believe in that word "slut," okay?
It shames female sexuality, and I'm against that 100%.
Okay, Holly?
Holly?
I'm sorry I yelled at Wade.
And chased him out of the house?
Hell, yes, and chased him out of the house.
I don't know what you expect me to do.
What self-respecting father in his right--
Andy, hush.
Hush.
Okay?
Now, y'all get on outta here and talk some sense into them kids.
Thank you.
- Love each other.
Mm-hmm.
You know what's weird?
I can still sense Bill.
His smell, maybe.
Or his presence when he's nearby.
Or if he's standing behind me,
I'll know he's there before I actually lay eyes on him.
Mm.
Even when I hate him, he's in my blood.
I loved Alcide.
I suppose I loved Eric, too, in my own way.
But there's something about the first, you know?
Yeah, I ain't never felt anything like that.
I mean, maybe with Jessica a little bit.
But that was-- it was all muddled up with Hoyt and everything.
You don't feel like that with Violet?
I don't feel a single one of those things with her.
And I'm-- well, I'm scared all the time.
Love shouldn't make you scared.
Not scared like that.
We don't know how much time we got left.
It doesn't seem worth it to spend it with someone you don't love.
I'm gonna tell Violet how I feel.
I gotta break it off.
Hello?
Uh-huh.
Okay.
No, no, thank you for telling me.
We-- we told Jess we'd call her as soon as--
Yeah, I'm gonna need a minute.
Or two.
Number 282. going once, going twice...
That's me.
Hello, mister...
- Uh, Compton.
- Compton, hi.
You wrote that book about the Hep-V crisis.
- Yes.
- Big fan.
Madeline Kapneck.
What can I do for you today?
I'd like to amend my will and pass my estate over my progeny.
Unfortunately, the state doesn't recognize progeny as a legal distinction.
They're not considered children and/or relatives under the law.
That shouldn't be a problem.
We can just transfer the estate to her name.
- And this will was drafted in...?
- 1894.
- And you were made vampire in...?
- 1865.
So you were impersonating a human when this document was first created?
No, I wasn't impersonating a human.
You were quote-unquote "in the coffin"?
Well, yes, but--
I'm just trying to establish a timeline, Mr. Compton.
No need to get defensive.
Sorry.
As you may or may not know, the Vampire Rights Amendment did not pass in Congress.
As the law stands now, thanks to the late great Governor Burrell, a citizen cannot posthumously execute a last will and testament.
Since when?
Since Burrell slipped it into an appropriations bill before his untimely death.
- I-I don't understand.
- You're technically dead.
- I realize that.
- And when this document was drafted, the assumption was you were quote-unquote "alive."
So you're saying that I can't pass my property over to my progeny.
It's unclear.
Some vampires are suing the state.
The case is winding its way through the courts.
Law is a moving target, and with this worldwide pandemic thing, the government's looking into ways to take advantage.
Lots of dead vampires.
They're seizing assets.
So what are my options?
Well, there are a few workarounds, mainly adoption.
So I could adopt Jessica.
I'll need you to fill out the requisite paperwork, and I'll go ahead and file a petition for adoption.
After that, we get a court date and then I make a motion before family court and then a social worker conducts a home study to make sure you're... fit to be a parent.
How long will that process take?
About five months to a year.
But I don't have that kind of time.
- I'm dying.
- Have you looked outside?
Everybody's dying.
Yes, but-- I mean, the virus is accelerating faster than usual, for some reason.
I'm sorry, it is what it is.
Is there some way to expedite the process?
Well, there is one way, but it's expensive.
- Well, how much?
- It's $10 million.
$10 million?
For what?
Moving you to the front of the line.
Are you trying to extort me?
It's a seller's market, Mr. Compton.
Why not just dig into some of those book proceeds?
You will move me to the front of the line, and you will do so free of charge.
You think you're the first vampire to come in here and try to glamor me, Mr. Compton?
They sell anti-glamoring contacts at the Walgreens now.
$10 million.
That's the price.
Thank you.
I will be taking my business elsewhere.
It's the same all over.
From the looks of those veins moving down your arm, you don't got much time.
You are a vulture like those men that I watched picking' the pockets of dead soldiers and prying' fillings from their mouths.
Don't lecture me on greed, Mr. Compton.
I sit here night after night in a room with no windows listening to you vampires whine about what a bum hand you've been dealt.
But you've had, what, 100, 200, or 500 more years to amass your fortune?
To spend eternity feasting off of the whole human race?
Sorry, but cry me a river.
Excuse me for using what little time
I have on the planet to make some cash--
Thank you for your time.
Hey, Adilyn?
Wade, darling?
We need to talk to y'all.
Listen, uh, I know I came down a little bit hard on you earlier, but we gotta talk, and I promise to keep my emotions in check for the good of a more productive discussion.
Adilyn Braelyn Charlaine Danika Bellefleur, get your little fairy butt down here!
They ain't here.
Where'd they go?
They said they were in love and they wanted to be alone.
It's pretty gross, if you ask me.
Did they say where they were going?
Look, I'm sorry.
They swore me to secrecy.
They swore you to secrecy, huh?
Honey, I'm starting to feel like my emotions are not so in check.
Now, do you want me to do it or do you want to do it?
'Cause it needs to get done.
Rocky, honey, you know that I love you.
I do.
But I'll gut you if I have to.
- Now, where the fuck did they go?
- Fort Bellefleur.
They went to Fort Bellefleur.
Don't.
Hey, there.
You're alive.
I was dead to you long before this.
Here's the thing, sis.
Um, some people are trying to kill me.
The Yakuza and some really just awful vampires, so I was really hoping I could hide here for just a few days.
- No.
- Please.
Amber, just till the heat's off.
You need to get the fuck outta my house.
I know you're sore at me, but you're all I got left.
Mom and Dad are dead.
They were killed last night.
Good.
How can you say that?
Look at me.
You all turned your back on me, and now you're in trouble and you have the fuckin' nerve to come crawling back here.
You make me sick.
You made me sick.
Not just me.
No, that wasn't enough for you.
You made everybody sick, the whole fuckin' world.
That wasn't me.
Are u denying that you and those disgusting scientists working for you created Hep-V?
I'm just saying that was a different me.
That was Sarah Newlin.
But I've changed.
I'm literally a different person now.
Your capacity for self-denial never ceases to amaze me.
My name is Noomi now, Amber, and I ally am a new me.
- Oh, my God.
- Just hear me out.
I was on the run.
The entire country looking for me, and I had nowhere to go and no one to turn to, so I needed to find a place where nobody knew who I was, which is hard when you're a celebrity.
But then one day, I read about this ashram nestled in the hills above Los Angeles.
- You at an ashram?
- It was perfect.
Amber, I needed to find a place where Sarah Newlin didn't exist.
And it was there that I realized
Sarah Newlin doesn't exist.
A beautiful, enlightened man named Guru Sanbir Dutta took me in and taught me that I am the Bodhisattva of the Earth.
What the fuck are you talking about?
It means that I was put on this planet to help people.
My whole life, I thought Christ was the answer, but now I know I was just parroting back a truly limiting notion of spirituality.
What I was lookin' for I found within.
I am a Buddha.
You are a Buddha.
We are, all of us, Buddhas.
Oh, fuck off.
You can hear it in my voice if you would listen.
Jesus Christ, sis.
You can't just dye your hair and blow a guru and absolve yourself of all the horrific shit that you have done in your life.
See, that's where you're wrong, because he showed me that all of this happened for a reason.
Don't you see?
All of this was meant to be.
If I hadn't created Hep-V, then you wouldn't be sick, and I wouldn't be here right now with the ability to heal you.
What are you talkin' about?
There was an antidote, Amber, and I drank it.
When the vampires revolted from the facility the scientists had created an antidote to Hep-V and I drank it down.
Every drop.
Everything has all come full circle.
The past doesn't matter anymore.
The future doesn't matter.
This is our now.
I am the antidote, sweetie.
Let me heal you.
Jessica?
You can come in.
It was positive?
I did this to him.
Jessica, I am so sorry.
I didn't know.
I didn't mean to.
Of course you didn't.
It's okay.
Violet... baby...
I know that you said
I was yours and you were mine, but I think we both know it ain't workin'.
It ain't workin'.
Violet?
Violet?
Vi--
"Dear Jason, relationship not working for me.
Over it.
Violet."
Oh, fuck.
Good-bye.
Good riddance.
Adilyn!
- Hello?
- Hey, don't freak out.
It's me-
- Violet.
Jason's girlfriend.
Um, I just wanted to talk to you, if that's okay.
Um... sure.
All right, comin' up.
Hiya.
- Hi.
- What you guys doin'?
- Nothin'.
- Uh-huh.
It doesn't look like nothin'.
Well, uh, we just wanted to be alone is all.
You know, without grownups all up in our business.
Uh-huh, I get that.
But Adilyn is fae, and I could smell her a mile away.
And if I could, you bet those H-vamps will find you.
We can't go home.
I have a place you can go.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Sure.
Oh, you guys, if you don't want to be tracked, you should ditch those phones.
Yeah, yeah.
- Thank you so much for doing this.
- Of course.
Who am I to stand in the way of true love?
What the fuck?
How come you're healed?

I swear to God, I had nothing to do with this.
HUGGINS:
We would love to believe you, Mr. Stevens.
But you have to admit, your version of events does sound pretty bizarre.
Don't you think?
Look, it was a setup, okay?
The whole thing was staged.
COHAGAN:
So you were framed, that's your claim, you were the victim?
Well, I mean, you know, not...
- Not like...
- HUGGINS:
Not like who?
Not like her?
Please, just talk to the other guys.
Have you talked to the others yet?
HUGGINS:
We're doing our jobs.
COHAGAN:
So, why don't you just do yourself a favor and confess.
You'll save some time, save some legal fees.
Come on.
HUGGINS:
Why don't you take us through the events of this morning?
Again?
Again, Mr. Stevens.

COHAGAN:
Where were you this morning, Mr. Stevens?
I was at home.
Alone.
My wife's taken the kids skiing.
Actually, your wife's on her way back, as we speak.
And apparently, she has quite a few questions of her own.
HUGGINS:
So the phone woke you around what time this morning?
I don't know.
9:00, 9:30?
It was Luke, in a panic.
He said I had to come.
COHAGAN:
Where were you supposed to go?
To the loft.
He told me to come to the loft.
Did he say why he was panicking?
No.
But did you know why he was panicking?
No.
Not yet.
Luke?
Luke?
(SNIFFLES)
Oh, my God!
Oh, fuck!
What the hell happened?
I don't know.
What do you mean?
You just...
I walked in, she was lying there and...
Oh, fuck.
(BREATHING SHAKILY)
Have you called the others?
Chris and Marty are on their way.
I still haven't reached Philip.
Okay.
Well, keep calling.
We need everybody here.
LUKE:
Do you know who she is?
Vincent.
Do you know who's lying there?
What?
No.
Of course not.
Well, how the fuck did they get in?
What, was it a window, a door?
Windows are sealed, the door was locked, and the alarm was turned off.
That's impossible.
I'm telling you.
The door was locked and the alarm was turned off.
But, that'd mean that...
Someone got in with one of our keys.
HUGGINS:
Do you know the loft building at the corner of 2nd and South Hope, Mr. Seacord?
No.
You know, the new residential one, down by the sports arena, designed, I believe, by your good friend Vincent Stevens?
Vincent runs a very large firm.
He's done a lot of buildings.
There's a loft on the ninth floor, Mr. Seacord.
Have you ever been there?
No.
Strange.
Because according to our information, you and four friends are sharing this loft.
Secretly, without your wives' knowledge.
(SCOFFS) That is ridiculous.
Don't the five of you bring women up there?
Girlfriends, mistresses, one-night-stands?
Catch of the day?
Five pals just looking for privacy and fun without the hassle of Visa statements and hotel bills the missus might find.
That is preposterous.
COHAGAN:
Maybe, Mr. Seacord.
But one of your friends already made a full confession.
You wanna know who?
Listen.
I don't do things like that, you know, fool around with other women.
I...
HUGGINS:
You love your wife.
I love my wife, yes.
HUGGINS:
What happened to your face, Mr. Seacord?
I walked into a door.
Or were you in a fight?
I said, I walked into a door.
Where were you this morning?
Out with Chris, having breakfast.
There will be a lot of people in the restaurant to verify that.
By Chris, you mean Dr. Chris Vanowen, the psychiatrist?
That's right.
- One of your loft buddies.
- LUKE:
Chris is married.
He's got two kids and, no, he's not a guy who cheats on his wife, either.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
We've got a serious fuckin' problem, Chris.
(SIGHS)
Oh, shit...
Philip.
Philip?
What?
You think your brother has something to do with this?
No.
We gotta call the cops.
You realize what'll happen if we call the cops?
Think about our wives.
There's a dead woman here, Vincent.
Why do we think Philip is involved?
Look, Chris.
You know what he's capable of.
Yeah, I know.
Maybe we can help him, okay?
If we can just figure out what the fuck happened and...
And then what?
We're gonna dump the body somewhere?
Look, I don't fucking know, but I'm not taking the fall for this!
(DOOR UNLOCKING)
(GASPS)
Marty.
Son of a bitch...
Have you seen Phil?
Do you know where he is?
Was he here last night?
This can't be real.
No.
Wait, what are you doing?
I want to see her.
Put her back.
Oh, God damn it.
Who is she?
I don't know.
Look, none of us has anything to do with this, right?
Right?
We're gonna find out what happened here and we will figure a way out.
We're in this together, we'll get out of it together.
Okay?
'Cause we're friends.
Agreed?
Agreed?
Well, it looks like they'll let anybody in, right?
- Congratulations, Vin.
- Thanks.
This one's really spectacular.
Very special.
I appreciate that.
Ally, it's been too long.
You look terrific.
Thank you.
So, uh, what do you think?
Well, it's bold and focused.
As always.
I like it.
Great!
You made it.
Hi.
Hi.
Hi, Barbara.
How are you?
Want to buy yourselves a little condo?
I think Vincent's little condos are a little out of our league.
Right, you and your puny psychiatrist's salary.
You guys grab a drink.
And we'll catch up with you later.
All right?
All right.
Congrats, bud.
Thanks, man.
One hour tops, and then we're out of here.
Oh, come on, hon.
We just got here.
Check out all these babes.
So hot!
It's like they're in violation of the fuckin' fire code!
Marty, calm down.
I see them.
I can also see Mimi, your wife.
Okay, save me, help me, protect me.
What's up, Tubs?
Having too much fun?
No.
Just checkin' out the hipster crowd with my pal Luke.
Mmm-hmm.
Yeah, if you embarrass me, I'll leave you here all by yourself.
Oh, don't raise my hopes only to dash them. (GIGGLES)
Hi, Luke.
Where's Ellie?
Oh, she was just feeling dizzy.
Ducked out to check her blood sugar.
MIMI:
Hi, Elle.
Do you feel okay?
Oh, I, um, started to feel not-so-great before, but I'm better now.
We can always go home, sweetie.
(CHUCKLES) Did you hear that?
"Sweetie!"
After she just checked her blood sugar.
That's funny.
That's really good.
I would love to see you deal with something like that if that was me.
Oh, you know, baby, I'd love to stick you in the ass every day.
- How many times have I asked?
- MIMI:
Honey?
Lots.
Not now.
You're the shrink, aren't you?
Uh, yeah, that's right.
Chris Vanowen.
Ah, Dr. Vanowen, that's right.
Yes, I remember.
Do we know each other?
Uh, no.
You knew my sister.
She was a patient of yours actually.
Sophie?
Sophie Morris?
Oh.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
(SCOFFS) Some people are just born unhappy.
I'm sorry.
Are you buying an apartment?
What?
Um, no, no.
I'm friends with the architect.
Ah.
Are you?
No, I'm here with Joel Kotkin.
The city councilman.
I work for him as sort of a personal assistant.
Oh.
I'm Anne.
Anne Morris. (GIGGLES)
Very nice to meet you, Anne.
And listen, about your sister...
It's okay.
You couldn't have saved her.
Her mood disorder kind of runs in the family.
Unfortunately, so...
Well, you're not thinking of doing something stupid, are you, Anne?
Me?
Oh, you mean like falling for the wrong man?
Well...
I do that all the time.
(GLASS SHATTERING)
Everything's all right!
Come on, keep partying!
What are you doing?
Phil, I should've guessed.
Hey, Vince, what's up?
Hey.
How are ya?
Thanks for comin'.
I'm sorry about this.
She slipped, man.
No worries.
As long as you're okay.
You all right?
I'm fine.
She's fine.
Come on.
Let me introduce you to a colleague who works with me at the office.
And this one works with me down at the office.
(ALL CHUCKLING)
Or is it the other way around?
CHRIS:
Philip?
Oh, my big brother.
How ya doin', man?
Friends of Vicky's?
Bridesmaids?
Oh...
Come on, man.
I'm still single, you know?
What are you doing?
What?
It's not like I don't love my little Vicky.
I love her madly, you know that.
All right?
It's not like I hate all the other women in the world.
All right.
All right.
Relax.
There's something I want to show you.
Let's go get Marty and Luke.
Chris?
Gentlemen, welcome to the loft.
MARTY:
Wow!
This is impressive, Vince.
Check out the view.
Then imagine that this is our own private oasis right in the heart of downtown.
What do you mean?
A place where no one hassles you.
A place you can escape to any time you want.
So this is your loft?
No.
It's ours.
- If you want it.
- CHRIS:
What?
Ours?
Think about it.
No messy hotel bills.
No questionable credit card activity.
This would be our secret place to steal away, discreetly and economically in these challenging times.
A five-way split.
What do you think?
(CHUCKLES)
I don't know.
I'm not like that.
Come on, Chris.
We're men.
We're all a little like that.
Yeah.
Tell me about it.
Give me your key right now.
Bring your twins up here, give 'em a little private tour.
You know what they cost, Marty?
How much?
I might have it on me right now.
Seriously.
Think about it.
It's a great investment.
A once-in-a-lifetime golden opportunity.
I can't stay here.
- CHRIS:
Where you going?
Luke?
- MARTY:
Hey, hey!
You cannot freak out right now.
We have to stay together like we said!
All right.
Really, Luke, you just need to calm the fuck down.
No!
No!
It's over, Vincent!
It's all gonna come out!
It's not over.
Listen, we're gonna find out what happened here and we're gonna fix it!
Okay?
Try Phil again.
(LINE RINGING)
This is Philip.
Please leave a message after the tone.
VINCENT:
What if he doesn't show?
He could be out of the country by now.
He'll show.
We can't cover for him, Chris.
Not this time.
MARTY:
Guys!
Look at this.
What's it mean?
What does it mean?
COHAGAN:
You know Latin, Doctor?
Excuse me?
Latin.
Do you know Latin?
I took it, pre-Med, yeah.
What's it say on the wall there?
"Fatum nos iungebit."
Yeah, I know.
"Fatum nos iungebit."
I can read that.
What's it mean?
I'm guessing you already know what it means.
No.
We would like to hear you say it.
You'd like to hear me say it.
Okay.
"Fatum nos iungebit."
"Fate will unite us."
Now, all I can possibly think is that somebody who knows Latin like you, reached over with this young lady's hand and wrote, "Fatum nos iungebit" on the wall.
(SCOFFS)
"Fatum nos iungebit" is wrong.
How so, Doctor?
The future imperfect tense of the verb unite, iungere, is not iungebit.
It's iunget.
It should say, "Fatum nos iunget."
So the person you're looking for made a classic Latin error.
But I'm guessing you knew that already, too, didn't you?
You know the phrase "fuck you"?
Germanic origin.
Where's your brother?
I'm sorry, I can't help you with that one.
Right.
Well, actually, he's your half-brother, isn't he?
Same mother, different fathers.
He spent some time in various institutions with your half-sister, Zoe?
Yeah.
That's right.
After our mother died, uh,
Philip wasn't as lucky with his father.
Apparently not.
Alcoholic child beater.
Mmm-hmm.
You didn't spend much time with Philip back then, did you?
No.
But now you're best friends.
Well, we've had a lot of catching up to do.
You really don't know where we can find him?
"Fate will unite us"?
Where the hell's your brother, Chris?
I don't know.
What the hell is this?
Where the fuck is Philip?
I'm right here.
Now, what the hell's going on?
You did this.
You did this!
- VINCENT:
Luke!
- CHRIS:
Hey!
Luke!
- LUKE:
What?
- VINCENT:
Luke, come here!
Hey!
- Hey!
- PHILIP:
Hands off!
Come on!
Bring it on!
What is this?
Cool it, Philip.
Luke!
Holy shit.
Did you have anything to do with this?
What the fuck are you talkin' about?
Just answer the fucking question!
Did you do this?
- Of course not!
- VINCENT:
Jesus!
Were you here last night?
No, man.
I wasn't here last night.
I slept at my in-laws'.
If you don't believe me, call Vicky.
What about this morning?
Were you here this morning?
I was at a project site, all right?
With my father-in-law.
Oh, my God...
Where were you last night?
Where have you been?
- Philip!
Take it easy.
- PHILIP:
Wait a minute.
Before accusing everyone else, where have you been?
'Cause I never got a text to say the loft was taken.
Never.
Last night I was at home.
Can you prove it?
No.
I can't prove it.
Because Barbara's taken the kids skiing.
You'll have to take my word for it.
Relax!
Come on!
Your word?
There's a dead woman in our loft that only us have access to.
Now, if anybody has anything to do with this, now's the time to say it.
Right now.
Thank you very much.
MARTY: (CHUCKLES) Well, Philip's got a ball and chain now.
Who would've thunk it?
Who's the father-in-law again?
His name's Hiram Fry.
He's a huge property developer.
His friends call him the Man of Steel.
Worth millions.
Vicky's his only daughter.
So what's not to love?
I just hope Philip will be happy.
(INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)
Well, that's cozy.
Come on.
VINCENT:
Ever since Councilman Kotkin got elected, the Man of Steel's been busy rebuilding downtown.
LUKE:
Kotkin came to your opening, right?
VINCENT:
Yeah, he turned up for a photo op.
When it comes to handing out permits and contracts though, the game's rigged.
Wait a minute.
Tell me what we're talking about again, 'cause I just saw some mini cheesecakes.
(ALL CHUCKLING)
Gorgeous, huh?
I mean, this whole setup.
Whoever said money can't buy happiness sure hasn't lived this life.
(ALL SINGING WEDDING MARCH)
Sorry, boys, you've lost your bachelor mascot.
He's all mine now.
Good luck with breaking this bronco, Vicky.
God knows others have tried.
But I'm not others, am I, Philip?
She told you.
VICKY:
And it's not just me.
Philip's married into the Fry family now.
MARTY:
Oh.
Soon as we're back from Fiji...
Yeah.
Well, gonna sell some properties with Vicky's dad.
You know, see how it grabs me.
Wow.
Grabs you!
(ALL CHUCKLING)
Well, guys, thanks for coming.
VINCENT:
Congratulations.
I'll be with you in a second, baby.
Oh, man, I need a break from all the ass-kissing.
Shit.
Where is Fiji?
PHILIP:
I don't know.
(ALL SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
You look beautiful.
Phil.
Your wedding present.
Are you for real?
Absolutely.
Don't lose it.
There's only five of these in existence.
Accepting a key to the loft means you accept the rules to the loft.
Marty.
Oh.
Are you crazy?
Our wives are here.
Don't you think that's a bit cynical, handing those things out here?
Cynical?
It's just a key to a room.
You should check it out.
Oh, no, you're not like that.
Not now.
Maybe later.
What about you, Luke?
Now or later?
Come on!
Atta boy.
(ALL CHUCKLING) Wow!
You just make sure this doesn't blow up in your faces.
How's it gonna blow up in our face?
It's just a room, like Vince said.
Our room.
(CHUCKLES)
Now we keep it to ourselves.
All right?
We tell nobody.
It just stays within our circle.
Marty?
Yeah?
Yeah!
Now you just need to find someone willing to go with you, Marty.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I think there's plenty of choices right here.
Some of these guys bring some premium grade, high test pussy.
Like that dewy-eyed vixen right there.
(SCOFFS) She looks underage.
No, she's 20.
And if one of you guys messes with her,
I'm gonna crack your head wide open.
MARTY:
Oh, what, do you got dibs on Miss Curly Locks?
Listen, man, that's Zoe.
All right?
- Zoe?
- PHILIP:
Yeah.
- Like as in skin-and-bones tomboy Zoe?
- PHILIP:
Yeah.
(EXCLAIMING)
I hate to say it, Phil, but your little sister's seriously hot.
Thanks, man.
MARTY:
She's not little anymore.
That is the finest piece of ass...
- Yo, Marty, that's enough.
- MARTY:
I'm just sayin'.
I'd like to fuck her like an animal.
Come on, Marty.
That's enough!
Feel her from the inside.
(SINGING) I wanna fuck you like an animal... (GROANS)
You don't sing, you don't laugh, you don't talk about my sister.
Got it?
You got it?
(GRUNTING)
(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
Don't fuck with me...
You watch it.
You watch it.
I'll kick your ass at your own fuckin' wedding.
Hi.
Hi.
We met at the, uh, building opening.
That's right.
You're Anne Morris.
I'm glad you remember me, Chris.
Mmm.
I see you work weekends.
What a dedicated personal assistant.
What a lucky city councilman.
(SCOFFS) Screw him.
D0 you?
(SCOFFS)
Must get a bit boring walking around all these parties by yourself.
He wants you close, but not too close.
Not when there's important people around.
(SCOFFS)
I told you, I fall for the wrong men.
Can you keep a secret?
Our city councilman likes to keep my panties with him at these events, in his pocket.
It's a turn-on for him, the thought of me in a crowd, so naked.
Only he knows.
Why do you let him use you like that?
Who says he's using me?
Maybe it turns me on.
Maybe me telling you about it turns me on even more.
I hope you don't catch cold.
Chris!
Chris, I'm sorry.
I don't know, maybe I was testing you.
I don't need to be tested.
Listen, do you want maybe get a cup of coffee?
Some place quiet?
Private?
(APPLAUSE)
(INAUDIBLE)
I'd like to use your key.
Just once.
It's not what you think.
Hey, it doesn't matter what I think.
Have fun.
VINCENT:
Does everyone still have a key?
'Course we do.
VINCENT:
It's crucial we get this right.
Five keys were cut.
To make a sixth, you'd need the code.
Which is in my safe, so we can rule that out.
But there was no break-in.
So does everyone still have a key?
PHILIP:
What?
You think we've been givin' away our keys?
It's against your rules, Vince.
Then show me.
What are we trying to prove here?
Look, I don't know.
Maybe someone's lost a key, okay?
Let's just rule that out.
Okay?
Look, here's mine.
All right?
Chris?
(SIGHS)
You didn't use a key to get in just now.
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)
No.
I didn't bring it.
Where is it?
I don't have it on me, okay.
It's not like I need it every day, like some of you guys.
But you do still have it?
Vincent, whether or not I have my key on me right now is really not important.
It's extremely fucking' important!
Someone got in using a key and yours is missing!
Is that right, Vincent?
Then how do you account for the fact that the alarm was shut off?
So, let's just cut the bullshit, 'cause it definitely had to be one of us five.
Unless...
Unless what?
Unless she let him in.
Oh, yeah.
Then how'd she get in, Vincent?
Any way you look at it, it keeps coming back down to us.
And I for one would like to know who's hiding something.
MIMI:
Where did you learn that?
BARBARA:
I seriously don't believe it.
MIMI:
There's a word for that?
BARBARA:
Yes, polyamory.
It's a philosophy, some sort of belief system about being romantically involved with more than one person at the same time.
Uh-huh.
And your boss gets away with it?
Yes.
He says that he's in love with his wife and his girlfriend,
- so why should he have to choose?
- MIMI:
Uh-huh.
And his wife is amazingly cool with it.
Oh, really?
Ls she special needs?
Maybe oxygen-deprived?
What?
Explain.
I'd like to know.
(CHUCKLES)
That sounds like my kind of philosophy, Barb.
What's it called again?
Polly and Marie?
Please.
Spare us, Tubs.
You can barely handle one woman.
What would you do with two?
Mmm.
Bury one.
(ALL LAUGHING)
MARTY:
I would make up something, some sort of game that involves two ladies and one guy.
Start a trapeze act or somethin'.
Could you at least fake some enthusiasm?
It's your party.
Anyway, I'm cooking.
If you absolutely have to invite your friends over, could you at least try to make it home on time?
Look, they're never here, okay?
Will you just join us?
I just hope the pudgy clown doesn't puke on the rug.
He's been chugging vodka like it's Evian. (SCOFFS)
I mean, doesn't his wife see that?
BARBARA:
Actually, she was just cool with it long enough to catch him in the act.
She hired a detective.
Cell phone records, credit card receipts, audio, video, the works.
And in a heartbeat my poor boss went from polyamory to alimony.
- MIMI:
Oh.
- (MIMI AND MARTY CHUCKLING)
MARTY:
Man, your boss sounds mentally retarded.
So, what happened to him?
Oh.
Uh...
He and his concubine are now cramped in a tiny one-bedroom condo.
But I'm guessing he's happy.
She's blonde, 23, with a brand new pair of fake breasts.
Ugh!
How can men stand fake breasts?
(FAKE GROANS) Why are women always talking about "fake tits" this "fake tits" that?
I mean, listen.
Girls, if it's a decent boob job, who fuckin' cares, you know?
My mom, she's got, uh, false teeth.
Okay?
When she smiles, do people give her shit and say,
"Oh, my God!
Look!
Fake!"
No, they don't!
They say, "Wow!
You look way better now.
"It's an improvement."
You know, you women, you're so catty, so competitive!
Calm down, Tubby dearest.
(STAMMERS) No.
You know what?
It's nothin' to be calm about, Mimi.
I mean, a glorious big set of fuckin' tits and a nice piece of ass, it's thrilling!
It's thrilling!
(LAUGHS AWKWARDLY)
(CLEARS THROAT) This is all a little too highbrow for my teeny, tiny, catty female mind.
Well, you know what?
You should have that enlarged.
Huh?
And while you're under, you should have the comers of your mouth lifted so you can smile every once in a while.
Sorry...
Sorry, Chris.
Marty.
Come on.
What?
No.
No, you're a class act, Marty.
Mimi, would you like to get your husband another drink, or should I do the honors?
You should do it.
And I want it chilled.
And then you go with her and stir.
Honey?
MARTY:
The problem with your boss, Barbara, is he didn't have his shit together.
I mean, apart...
Apart, I mean.
No.
I mean, he didn't compartmentalize.
You guys agree?
BARBARA:
All right, Marty.
How would you compartmentalize?
How?
Okay, well, since you asked.
First thing first is I wouldn't have a place that you could get caught.
Not a hotel, not your girlfriend's crib.
That's key, right?
Am I right, Vinnie-boy?
Am I right?
(SCOFFS) Marty, you've lost us all.
(CHUCKLING)
I doubt that.
I doubt that, Vinnie-boy!
Okay, first of all, sorry, baby.
I would just get a little one-bedroom condo, or something like that.
(EXCLAIMING) (GASPS)
God damn it!
Wow.
You all right?
Mimi, your husband tends to talk out of his ass when he's been drinking.
Yeah?
Come on.
There we go.
(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
Hon, would you give me a hand?
Sure.
(SNIFFS)
Sorry.
Didn't know you were in here.
No problem.
Ate too much too fast, I guess.
Thai food, you know.
Yeah.
It gets all up in your nose and shit.
Yeah.
It's a little spicy.
Yeah.
I'm out of here.
Bye.
(EXHALES SHARPLY)
LUKE:
I need to pick up some more insulin.
Luke?
Ls there something you wanna tell me?
Are you keeping secrets?
(CHUCKLES)
What kind of secrets?
Is there someone else?
I don't know why you start asking me silly questions, but the answer is no.
I'm not cheating on you, Ellie.
That's not what I'm asking, Luke.
I'm asking if there's someone else.
(GASPS)
Listen, sweetie.
Whatever I may be, or may not be and I know I'm not as glamorous as some
but I'll always be there for you.
And the children.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
I want you to know there's a lot I could put up with.
LUKE:
What are you doing?
We need to get her out of here.
How?
She is shackled to the bed!
Can't you guys see what's going on?
Someone is trying to frame us!
Who?
Who wants to frame us?
I don't know.
But think about it.
The body's cuffed to the bed.
It's impossible to move.
The Latin, the knife.
Someone did this for a reason.
Hell, the cops could be here any second.
But none of us know who this girl is.
We don't even know how she got in here.
Who else knew about the arrangement?
Who else knows about our arrangement?
Did anyone blab?
Tell one of the girls that have been up here?
Marty?
What?
Why me?
Some night you were hammered, maybe?
I've always followed the rules, Vincent!
Did you give anyone your code?
Did you key in while someone was watching?
Absolutely not!
I just told you.
All right.
Wait.
What's your point, Vincent?
Where you going with this?
Someone is trying to set us up.
Like who?
I don't know.
A rejected girlfriend, a jealous boyfriend, betrayed husband, someone with a motive.
Look, is one of you guys in some kind of trouble?
(MOANING)
(BOTH BREATHING HEAVILY)
(ANNE GROANING)
(BOTH PANTING)
(BOTH CHUCKLING)
(SIGHS HEAVILY)
I think I may be falling in love with you.
You don't have to say that.
No, but I mean it.
Why would you say that, Chris?
Why would you even feel it?
I've never cheated on my wife before.
And I don't fall in love easily.
Chris, I don't want you to love me.
You don't even know me, apart from these stolen moments.
I mean, they're exciting, yeah, sure.
But they're just moments.
Let's change that.
I wanna see you more often.
Chris, please...
Not just for this.
No, stop it.
(STAMMERS)
I don't want you to love me.
Well, I don't wanna keep sneaking around.
I'm gonna tell Alison about us.
No, you're not.
Yes, I am.
Anne.
(SIGHS)
I'm gonna leave her.
Stop it!
Why are you doing this?
The people you love, they're the only ones who can hurt you.
I would never hurt you, Anne.
Stop.
Stop what?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Would you...
Stop it, okay?
You don't know me.
Okay?
That's the end of it.
Well, would you give me a chance at least to...
I'm a whore.
All right?
What?
I'm a prostitute.
I fuck men for money.
Do you get it now?
Don't worry, Doctor.
I won't bill you for the past few months.
Please, Anne, would you...
(STAMMERS)
Chris...
Would you wait a minute?
Please.
Stop it.
You don't know the half of it.
All right?
Just go home.
Go home to your wife and your kids.
Is your friend Chris Vanowen cheating on his wife, Mr. Landry?
MARTY:
Oh, I doubt that.
Chris is a very devoted husband and a...
And a model dad, just like all the rest of your pals, right?
Except for you.
You're not exactly squeaky clean, are you, Marty?
Um, I don't know what you mean.
Why does your wife want a divorce?
Divorce?
(MUTTERING)
What we're going through, uh, separation.
It's a trial separation.
Why?
Um, because she found out something that she wasn't too happy about.
You fucked around on her.
If you wanna be technical.
How'd she find out?
The woman with whom I...
Fucked around?
Yeah.
Well, apparently expected something a little more and she showed up on our front porch.
The bitch started to...
The woman in question started saying things.
And my only hope is that Mimi will come around eventually because I love her very much.
Did you go with this woman to the loft?
What?
No.
This happened in San Diego.
That's where you met the woman, right?
In San Diego?
Yeah.
Why were you there?
A commercial real estate convention.
Vince had a couple of extra tickets, a VIP thing.
You know, a couple nights in a fancy hotel and a chance to get away for a couple days.
And nights.
Yeah.
Nights, too.
Man, do you see that?
Jesus, Vince.
Those girls are drooling all over you.
Invite 'em over.
You got first dibs.
I'm happy with second best, too.
- He's cute.
- WOMAN:
See him?
I'll take a rain-check on that.
What?
Are you fucking crazy?
Why wouldn't you invite them over?
'Cause, Marty,
I'd rather dive for some rare and exotic sea creature than shoot fish in a barrel.
(SCOFFS)
Does Barbara know about these deep-sea expeditions of yours?
What, are you kidding me?
Yeah.
What's your problem, Seacord?
You got a key to the loft.
What do you do up there, your laundry?
Dishes?
Hey!
Are you guys here on business, or what?
I'm Dana.
My first time here.
It's a little overpriced for what you get, don't you think?
Hi, Dana.
I'm Vincent.
This is Marty, Luke.
Can we, uh, buy you a drink?
Hey, when I said overpriced, I wasn't trolling for free booze.
No...
I mean, I didn't think...
Well, since you asked, what are you drinking?
Ooh, champagne?
A girl can dream.
Champagne?
Please.
All right.
One champagne coming up.
(MESSAGE TONE CHIMING)
What are you doing?
The fat chick's gonna scare off all the hot chicks.
Marty.
Every fat chick has a good-looking friend.
Hers is probably on her way down right now.
Okay, yeah.
Well, what if she is the good-looking friend and the really fat chick's on her way down?
I think that's Philip's father-in-law.
MARTY:
Oh.
Yeah, it is.
I'll be.
That's the Man of Steel, all right.
But that ain't Mrs. Steel.
Think we should give him a key?
(CHUCKLING)
Maybe.
Not mine.
I'd like a bottle of your finest champagne and four glasses, please, for the table in the corner.
You, uh, were at my daughter's wedding.
Philip's friends.
You're the architect.
Vincent Stevens.
We should talk sometime, Mr. Stevens.
Sure.
What do you got in mind, Mr. Fry?
We have a new waterfront project.
It's massive, it's cutting edge.
It might be right up your alley.
Of course, it's all preliminary.
We have to keep it under wraps.
I hope you can be discreet.
Sure.
Discretion, Mr. Stevens.
That's the main thing.
(SPEAKING LATIN)
A word to the wise.
You are wise?
Yeah.
Sure.
Wise, uh...
Wise and discreet, Mr. Fry.
I'm in software.
I can be discreet myself, and wise.
I'll pick up their tab as well.
Well, have a nice evening, gentlemen.
(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Sweetheart?
Sweetheart?
Excuse me.
(CLEARS THROAT)
Hi, this is Anne.
Leave a message.
ALISON:
Who are you calling at this hour?
(GASPS)
(EXHALES SHARPLY)
No one, I was just checking my voicemail.
And what does your voicemail say?
That you're a lousy liar, Chris Vanowen?
What are you talking...
ls something wrong?
You tell me, Chris.
Alison, I...
I'm going to bed.
Alison!
DANA:
Excuse me.
That's not thinking.
It's called following your dick around.
Okay, two kinds of articles in Cosmo month after month.
One, men are pigs.
Two, how do I seduce a pig to chop my wood?
- DANA:
I don't read Cosmo month after month.
- MARTY:
Well, I do.
(CHUCKLES) I don't...
Well, I do.
DANA:
And I find it strangely compelling.
You know what I find strangely compelling?
What?
Your eyebrows.
(DANA CHUCKLING)
MARTY:
Lumberjack contest.
I can't leave you alone for a minute.
Oh, Sarah.
It's been more like an hour.
I mean, thank God I've been subsidized.
Aren't you going to introduce me to your new friends?
HUGGINS:
And that was the first time you met her?
Yeah.
That was, uh...
- That was the first time.
- HUGGINS:
Sarah?
Yeah, her name was Sarah.
COHAGAN:
Mr. Stevens, what else happened in San Diego?
(SIGHS) What do you want to know?
Everything.
(MEN CHUCKLING)
MARTY:
I got another one!
VINCENT:
No!
LUKE:
Shh.
Keep it down.
Keep it down.
VINCENT:
This is insane, Sarah.
You should never dare a crazy woman.
Vincent, we should probably go back.
Luke, lighten up.
It's okay.
Mmm.
Hmm.
So I got you the pool...
Now you have to keep your end of the bargain.
MARTY:
Come over here.
Let's sit.
Yeah.
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Come on.
Don't keep us waiting.
Take it off.
Think I'm gonna be sick.
What?
Vince's body's not that bad.
Not Vince, the shrimp cocktail!
MARTY:
What?
Dana!
Dana!
Come back here!
Your turn.
No. (SCOFFS)
Take it all off.
Not bad.
Whoa!
(GIGGLES)
Is this still too scary for you, Luke?
Are you gonna join us?
I'm...
I'm fine right here.
But I need you, 'cause Vincent's gonna try and make a move on me soon.
And if you're here, maybe he won't dare.
Well, maybe Vincent's not interested.
Maybe Vincent'd rather do laps.
(GIGGLES FLIRTATIOUSLY)
That would explain the last few hours of casual but meaningful glances that each lasted a second too long.
You like to play games, huh?
I do.
And I'll tell you something else.
I'm better at it than you.
Can you feel me?
Most definitely.
Marty?
(MARTY AND DANA MOANING LOUDLY)
Marty, I need my room key.
Dude, I'm kind of busy here!
Don't stop!
Go!
Just do it!
(SARAH SOBBING)
You're scared, is what it is.
You're running away from your feelings.
(SNIFFLES)
I don't want to say goodbye.
Do you have any idea what it's like to really love someone?
I'm sorry.
(SOBBING)
LUKE:
What are you doing?
Throwing it away.
It's empty.
You were here yesterday, weren't you?
CHRIS:
Guys?
We gotta go to the cops.
We're not getting anywhere with this.
First, I think Vincent has something to tell you.
All right, let's hear it.
(INTERCOM BUZZING)
What the hell?
(CONTINUES BUZZING)
Hello?
Who is it?
Who is it?
It's a realtor who wants to come up.
Somebody listed the loft for sale?
What?
Oh, Jesus fucking...
Listed the loft?
She said she has an appointment with a Deakins...
Sarah Deakins.
(STAMMERS) Who's Sarah Deakins?
Wait.
Who the hell is trying to sell our loft?
You know her, Marty.
What?
You know her, and so does Luke.
Sarah Deakins is lying on the bed.
You guys, I promise, I've never seen a Sarah Deakins.
That's not true.
You know her.
Why do you keep Saying that?
You met her in San Diego, the last night, in the bar.
Remember?
Dana's friend.
The last night?
I was wasted out of my mind.
The whole night's a blur.
(INTERCOM BUZZING) Jesus!
Luke, you remember her, don't you?
That's Sarah?
You remember Sarah.
You remember her, right?
(STAMMERING) Yes.
I remember Sarah.
But how was I supposed to know that's Sarah?
Come on, guys!
What the hell's going on?
You guys turned her over and looked at her face.
I did not.
(BUZZING CONTINUES)
Yeah.
I think there's been a mistake.
We don't know anyone named Sarah Deakins.
Marty, come on!
Who is it?
Do we know her?
I don't know.
Fuck!
CHRIS:
So, is that all you wanted to tell us, Vince?
Or is there more?
(BREATHING SHAKILY)
I had a thing with her.
I brought her up here a couple times.
But I swear on my kids,
I had nothing to do with this.
Would you just fuckin' tell me?
Were you here with her last night?
Were you the one who let her in?
I broke up with her last night.
I swear she was alive when I left.
It still doesn't explain why someone listed the loft!
Something special or just browsing?
(SCOFFS)
Why don't you return my phone calls?
(SCOFFS)
If you're dumping me, at least have the decency...
Chris, how can I dump you?
There's nothing between us.
So that's what I mean to you?
Nothing?
Did you forget what I told you already?
Who I am, what I do?
No.
I haven't.
It doesn't change how I feel about you.
How many women have you taken to that fuck-pad you share with your four little buddies?
What?
Please, Chris.
Save it for some girl who'll actually buy your bullshit.
Anne...
No.
Wait!
Wait.
You know I'm not like that.
Here.
I only need this if I'm with you.
So you keep it.
If you wanna see me again, you let me know.
(CAR HONKS)
Chris?
Um, what are you doing here?
Shopping for Alison?
Uh, no...
No, um, I was just here with a colleague.
Does your wife know you've been sharing the loft with your pals?
LUKE:
I already told you, I'm not sharing a loft with any pals.
I was there just once, at a party, when the building first opened.
Then you have been there?
A minute ago, you didn't even know where the building was.
I never took anyone up there.
I thought that's what you meant.
Well, did you know the girl?
We met once in San Diego.
Are you aware that Mr. Stevens began a relationship with her in San Diego?
That would surprise me, frankly.
You didn't know?
Isn't Vincent Stevens your best friend?
It's so obvious what you're trying to do here, trying to turn us against each other.
But guess what?
I'm not about to start trashing my friend.
Is it possible, Mr. Seacord, that you were jealous of your best friend?
When he's nailing all these beautiful women?
I am a married man.
I'm not interested in nailing women.
I'm not jealous of Vincent.
Oh, no.
I didn't mean jealous of him, Mr. Seacord.
I meant jealous of the women.
Where do you get off with an innuendo like that?
Fucking bastards.
Why are you so angry, Mr. Seacord?
Vincent is my closest friend.
And he has been for years.
Yeah.
Fine.
But your best friend is selling you out as we speak, Mr. Seacord.
- You and the rest of your gang.
- No.
Vincent would never sell out his friends.
You're full of shit.
Asshole.
What'd you call me?
You heard me, you lying piece of shit!
I broke up with her and I left!
That's it!
PHILIP:
Yeah?
After you cut her up with this, right?
Put the knife down.
Philip!
I didn't kill her.
- CHRIS:
Back off.
- Why?
Hey, put the knife...
Put the knife down!
Hey, hey!
Back off.
The loft was listed in her name.
That's not a coincidence.
Someone's trying to pin this on us.
On you, you mean.
Jesus!
Get a fuckin' grip!
Fuck!
Guys, we cannot keep doing this.
What do you wanna do, Marty?
Huh?
Just leave me hanging?
MARTY:
Hey, Vince?
Vince?
Are you in there?
If you're in there, hey, man, I need to talk to you for just a second.
Christ, Marty, I've got company.
Didn't you get my text?
Mimi's gone!
She's gone!
Fucking gone!
What do you mean gone?
Gone where?
She left me.
She found out about San Diego.
That dumpy chick, she showed up.
She told her everything.
Fuck!
Wait a minute.
You didn't tell Mimi about the loft?
What?
It's not about the goddamn loft, Vince!
It's about my wife!
(BLUBBERING) I don't know what I'm gonna do without her!
(STAMMERS) Did you confess?
Never confess, Marty.
Never confess.
Would you go to her?
Just tell her that I love her.
You know?
And that Dana's lying?
She'll believe you.
Marty, I will straighten this out for you.
I promise you, I will straighten this out.
Okay.
Hey, come here.
It's okay.
(CONTINUES SOBBING)
Thanks.
CHRIS:
Okay, so what's the plan?
What do we do now?
We get her out of here.
What?
We can't just make a body disappear.
Well, that's too bad.
It's our only hope.
You had a relationship with her.
Now she's some inconvenient piece of evidence?
What kind of man are you?
That's a laugh, coming from you.
And how do you plan to get her off the bed?
Cut off her hand?
Or do you have the key to those cuffs?
You know what?
I thought handcuffs were more your thing than mine, Phil.
Meaning what?
You know exactly what I mean.
(PHILIP SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)
(WOMAN WAILING)
PHILIP:
Shut up!
Shut up!
Just keep your fuckin' mouth shut!
All right?
Please!
Help me!
Please help me!
Keep your fucking mouth shut!
He's crazy!
This fucking whore started to rip me off!
- Please help me!
He raped me!
- Shut up!
Hey...
Easy!
All right!
(STAMMERING) All right!
We mean it.
It's gonna be okay.
He's crazy!
(GASPING)
Shit!
Okay.
Philip, give me the keys.
The bitch is gonna go to the cops, man.
Gimme the keys to the handcuffs.
She's gonna go to the cops!
The keys!
You want the key?
He made me do things that I didn't want to do.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Easy.
What?
You want more money?
That's it, right?
It's all about the money, huh?
It's all about the fucking money!
Here's your fucking money!
It's right there!
Jesus Christ!
What the fuck is the matter with you?
Have you lost your fucking mind?
She's a whore, Chris!
- Do you know what a whore is?
- Shut up!
You can't rape a whore!
You can't rape a whore!
You can't rape...
Shut the fuck...
You don't treat a woman like that!
You got it?
Not any woman!
Don't fuckin' touch me, all right?
Cool it!
What the fuck's the matter with you, man?
You're putting us all at risk!
(SOBBING) I want police.
He hit me.
Shut up.
(WOMAN SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY)
- He rape me!
- Shut up!
Stop screaming!
I'm gonna rip your goddamn throat out!
I've had it with you!
You're no better than your father!
I'm what?
You heard me.
All right, Chris.
That's a nice one.
Chris had a better deal with his daddy, right?
The great guy who wants to save everyone.
Where were you, when Zoe and I were getting beat up?
And Mom in the next room, pretending not to hear.
Where were you?
In your cozy college dorm getting laid and wasted, 'cause you didn't give a fuck!
I didn't know anything about it.
You didn't give a crap!
All those years we didn't exist for you!
I didn't know anything about it!
If you would've told me, if you would've said something!
Then what, you phony?
Then what?
Then I would've gotten you out of there!
God damn it!
Both of you!
(BLUBBERING)
Listen.
I'm really, really sorry, but we can't go to the cops.
Here's what I'm gonna do.
No, listen.
I have a friend, he's a doctor.
No...
Yes.
I'm gonna drive you to him.
He's gonna take care of you.
Okay?
No...
No, here.
Listen.
Take it.
I know it's not enough for what happened tonight.
He's an animal.
He should be locked up!
CHRIS:
Okay.
And we're gonna deal with him, I promise you.
Come on.
Now, get your clothes and I'm gonna take you to the doctor.
- WOMAN:
No!
- CHRIS:
Easy.
Here we go.
No!
(CONTINUES SOBBING)
(DOOR SLAMS)
I'll never forgive you for this.
Never!
What's your problem?
MARTY:
Jesus Christ!
Why don't I know anything about this?
And when did it happen?
A couple of weeks ago.
We decided to keep it to ourselves, 'cause that's the kind of friends we are.
Don't lecture me, all right?
Especially about friendship.
Oh, right.
Sorry.
I meant to give you the cokehead rapist lecture.
Fuck you.
Well, you could see how I think you'd be involved in this.
I need to say something.
(DOOR CLOSES)
Oh, shit.
- PHILIP:
You had that coming!
- CHRIS:
Hey!
Take it easy.
CHRIS:
Relax.
Take it easy.
PHILIP:
Get up!
You son of a bitch.
You recorded everything that went on here.
Every woman...
Not every.
Not always, just sometimes.
At least I don't cheat on my wife.
No, you just watch us and beat off.
You sick fuck.
You're a sick fuck!
Luke, did you record last night?
No.
You didn't say you were coming.
Which is against your rules.
And that wasn't the first time you broke your own rules, by the way.
Now you're scared, aren't you?
Now you know I've documented pretty much everything you've been up to here.
No worries, Vincent.
I'll keep my mouth shut, like I always do.
Did you see anything that can help us out here?
Anything at all?
If all the people who've been hurt and cheated on find out the truth,
what do you think'll happen, Vincent?
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
(PEOPLE CLAPPING)
What's the matter?
I just don't feel like leaving tomorrow.
Serious?
You love skiing.
Yes.
I love to ski.
But just not by myself.
Are you sure you can't come?
Babe, you know I can't come.
I can't just take off right now.
Hey.
I'll call you every day.
I love you.
I know the drill.
One hour, right?
Wrong.
Have a blast, don't mind me.
Why should tonight be any different from the past few months?
Look, Alison, if it's all right with you, I'd rather not spoil tonight.
I'm sure it must be tempting to grab something shiny and new.
But do you ever think about what you might stand to lose, Chris?
You could ruin a lot more than just this evening.
Tell me, are you so happy, Alison?
(PEOPLE CLAPPING)
Well, what do you know?
If it's for charity, my mother-in-law is allowed to join the party for a little while.
You heard anything about the waterfront project?
No.
He's gonna call once he gets his permits.
As far as I know, everything's approved.
Really?
Yeah.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Ladies, you look absolutely ravishing tonight.
Thank you.
This is Vincent Stevens.
He's the architect who designed the new loft building near the sports arena.
Oh, wonderful.
I love that building.
Why, thank you, Mrs. Kotkin.
I really appreciate that.
As I was saying to your husband in San Diego, gentlemen in our business can't afford to be exposed to the negative consequences of bad design.
Speaking of San Diego, how's that waterfront project coming along?
Oh, yes.
We're still working on it.
We've applied for all our permits and now we're waiting.
Standing in line like everyone else.
You don't strike me as the type of man that stands in line, Mr. Fry.
What about you, Mr. Kotkin?
Are you a gambling man?
And you, Mr. Stevens?
You like to take chances?
As a matter of fact, I do.
Especially when I'm holding a handful of hearts.
Anyway, I don't mean to interrupt.
Ladies, if you're as lucky on the tables tonight as you are in love, then I am sure you'll hit your jackpots.
Gentlemen, always a pleasure.
(LAUGHING)
CROUPIER:
Blackjack!
WOMAN #1:
Wow!
Ooh!
Set aside enough for the Ali-money. (CHUCKLES)
Mimi, what are you doin' here?
Just 'cause I booted you out doesn't mean I'm stuck at home.
Pumpkin, I want to come back.
I know I screwed up once.
Once.
I was drunk off my ass.
I swear it didn't mean a damn thing.
Something I don't understand about men.
If it doesn't mean anything, why bother?
I promise I'll change.
Into what, a frog?
Certainly not a prince.
How 'bout the ass you already are?
What if I told you I wanted to fuck around tonight?
Sorry.
(CHUCKLING) It would hurt like hell, wouldn't it?
Hey, maybe I already got even.
Maybe with one of your pals.
Maybe Chris, he's cute.
Or how about Vincent, the night you sent him over for that tragic heart-to-heart?
Aw.
(MIMICKING VINCENT) "Marty's really suffering.
"Mimi, you've gotta talk to him."
CROUPIER:
Blackjack!
Oh!
Well, look at that, Tubs, your first-ever winning streak.
Just remember, dear heart, half of it is mine.
(INDISTINCT CHEERING)
(EXCLAIMING IN EXCITEMENT)
You gave Zoe a ticket for tonight?
Philip, let go.
I keep her away from bullshit like this, and then behind my back...
Christ, Phil, she's almost 20 years old.
What are you, her father?
Did you see her?
She looks like a whore.
(CHUCKLES) I thought you like whores.
Yeah.
Let her have some fun.
If you'll excuse me, I'm about to have some fun, too.
I'm kind of on a roll.
Yeah?
Yeah.
Yeah.
I hope you win big time.
You'll need it with all the shit you've been packin' up your nostrils.
(SCOFFS) So you noticed a tiny fraction of your stash went missing?
Yeah.
If you don't like it, file for divorce.
I haven't ruled that out.
Don't forget about our pre-nup, loser.
(SCOFFS)
While you're at it, go play some blackjack.
Could be your last best chance at paying the rent.
Can I get some dice over here?
(PEOPLE APPLAUDING)
Hands-off.
Excuse me.
(ALL CHEERING)
(CELL PHONE BEEPS)
(DOOR CLOSES)
Anne?
Anne?
We need to talk.
Yeah?
About what?
Your pal, the architect.
He's playing with fire.
(TOILET FLUSHES)
I'd actually rather talk about Anne.
(DOOR OPENS AND CLOSES)
(CLEARS THROAT)
I'll pass along your message to Vincent, but I'd like something, too, Mr. Kotkin.
I'd like for you to stop seeing Anne.
And why would I do that?
Because I love her.
Then we have more in common than we thought.
I'd like you to stop paying her.
I want you to let her go.
That's really not up to me.
Fact is, it's totally her choice.
Except I never paid for her.
Well, that's true.
You never paid.
ANNE:
Stop it, Joel.
I'm going.
What did he mean by that, "You never paid"?
I don't want to love you, Chris.
Is he saying someone's paying you to be with me?
You're the only one who can hurt me.
Anne?
Tell me it's a lie.
(SOBS)
The first time, it was paid for.
Every other time, that was real, that was me.
But who paid?
I can't...
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)
PHILIP:
Excuse me.
Come on, Zoe, let's go.
I'm fine here.
I'm asking you to come with me.
Come on.
And I'm asking you to stop.
Did you not hear the lady?
Mind your business.
Stop!
What, are you deaf or just a dick, huh?
I don't know, man.
What does it say up here?
"Deaf" or "dick"?
Help me out.
(GRUNTS)
ZOE:
Philip!
Stop!
Don't!
Fuck!
- Come on!
- HIRAM:
Excuse me.
Thank you.
ZOE:
You're just like Dad!
Shut up!
ZOE:
You are just like him!
Somebody get this guy an ambulance.
I never want to see you again, not in my home and not near my daughter.
Do you got that?
Get him the hell out of here.
Okay, folks!
Let's get back to the gaming tables, shall we?
(SOBS)
Hey, it's okay.
I'm sorry.
Hey, it's okay.
Let's go.
Let's get out of here.
It's not what you're thinking.
And what am I thinking?
She's my friend's sister, okay?
Are there more?
Besides me, her, and your wife?
What's the grand total?
VINCENT:
Look, I can't have this conversation here.
Barbara's standing right over there.
Do you love me?
Of course I love you.
I'm crazy about you.
But would you choose me?
If you could?
You know it's not that simple.
Come meet me at the loft tomorrow, okay?
We'll talk it through.
You're right.
It's not that simple.
But maybe I can make it simple.
What do you mean?
Maybe I can help you make that choice.
Sarah...
Sarah.
Sarah!
Sarah!
(GRUNTS)
LUKE:
I'm sorry.
Are you all right?
(SOFTLY) Don't do it, Sarah.
You'll regret it.
They found out.
(ECHOING) They set us up.
They set us up.
Our wives, they...
They set us up.
Why, Vincent?
They...
They found out.
They found out about the loft.
Why would you do it, Vincent?
We're your friends.
(GRUNTS)
VINCENT:
No...
Why did you do it?
(VINCENT BREATHING HEAVILY)
No...
It was our wives.
They found out.
No, it's your friends.
We found out.
What's going on?
You still don't get it.
(GROANING)
All right, strip him.
What are you doing?
You are a total fucking psychopath.
I did what you told me.
I didn't tell you to fucking cut her open!
That wasn't a part of the plan.
And the Latin on the bed?
Like the cops are gonna believe that bullshit.
Then you should've done it yourself.
Come on.
Let's do this.
What'd you give me?
PHILIP:
What you deserve.
You killed Sarah?
No.
We just found her.
What?
We were here this morning, Vincent.
Before you arrived.
(SIGHS)
MARTY:
Jesus Christ.
LUKE:
At first I thought she was sleeping.
CHRIS:
Vincent knows her?
She left him this.
"See you in the next life."
Why did she have to do it here?
We gotta call the cops.
They investigate suicides.
This is all gonna come out.
Guys, wait.
Can't we find out where she lives and leave her there?
LUKE:
Jesus!
Philip!
Come on, we have to help out Vince!
Yeah.
Speaking of which, where the fuck is Vince?
Isn't this his problem?
Hmm...
Vincent isn't here because".
- Because I didn't call him.
- CHRIS:
You didn't call him?
Why didn't you call him?
There's something I have to show you.
You've been taping us?
You fucking pervert!
You can beat the crap out of me later.
We don't have much time, and you need to watch this.
(PANTING)
Maybe you'll get a new perspective on what happened upstairs.
Maybe you'll agree, we shouldn't take the hit for Vincent's fuckup!
You see, Vincent...
Vincent hasn't always been a good friend.
(INDISTINCT MOANING OVER RECORDING)
(WOMAN MOANING)
No.
MIMI:
God!
Hey, maybe I already got even.
Or maybe Vincent, the night you sent him over for that tragic heart-to-heart.
It's okay.
(MARTY SOBBING)
They got here late, the night he went to talk to her.
She was drunk, Marty.
He took advantage.
(SNIFFLES)
Wow!
Your little sister's seriously hot.
Hey...
How long has it...
It doesn't matter.
How long?
(MOANING)
He started seeing her right after your wedding.
They met here on a regular basis.
If I'm not mistaken, he was her first.
Fuck!
Gorgeous, huh?
ANNE:
The people you love, they're the only ones who can hurt you.
LUKE:
He paid Anne to let you seduce her, put the hook in, so you'd want a share of the loft.
The first time, it was paid for.
VINCENT:
Have fun.
Chris, please.
You don't know the half of it.
All right?
Just go home.
LUKE:
He used her, Chris.
Just like he used everyone.
Everyone.
PHILIP:
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.
Vincent can't sense anything is up when he walks in.
We have to try and remain calm.
We're gonna get questioned by the cops.
That's why we can never admit we're sharing this loft.
Or they'll try to turn us against each other.
Okay.
I think this can work.
As long as we follow the plan.
Chris?
(SIGHS)
Okay.
I'm in.
But only if we know for sure that Vincent was here last night.
I wanna hear him say it.
And if he does, I'll go through with it.
I'll give a signal...
Break something, a glass.
But nothing happens until we know for sure.
Understood?
LUKE:
We've got just under two hours to set everything up and establish alibis.
I'll take care of it.
You guys get out of here.
Make sure people see you.
You have the suicide note, right?
I've got it.
You knew what that prick was up to and you never said anything.
You're just as sick as Vincent.
(DOOR OPENS)

What happened here?
(PILLS CLATTER)
You're framing me!
Oh, fuck!
(GROANING)
Jesus, swallow it.
(COUGHING)
VINCENT:
My own friends.
(GROANS)
My own friends!
(SIGHS)
Am I gonna die?
No, Vincent, you're not gonna die.
Sarah lured you here and drugged you.
Then she killed herself, with you by her side. "Fate will unite us."
But you're gonna survive.
'Cause we're friends, aren't we?
VINCENT:
So, you see, it was a setup.
Sarah and I were set up.
The whole thing was staged.
HUGGINS:
Still sounds a little unbelievable, don't you think?
Unbelievable.
But it's the truth.
Yeah.
My line of work, you gotta prove the truth.
And you prove it with facts and findings.
Fact is, we only found your prints and those of Sarah Deakins.
Yeah, because they wiped the place clean.
HUGGINS:
And we have the DVDs of all your sexual exploits, with your prints all over them.
Luke made those DVDs.
I never even saw 'em, let alone touched 'em.
Yeah.
But we got no DVDs of your friends.
No DVDs of Marty's wife.
No DVDs of Philip's sister.
No DVDs of Chris' girlfriend.
All right?
Facts and findings, Mr. Stevens.
And we got no evidence that you were being set up.
All right.
Ls there anything we've forgotten?
Yeah.
To follow the fuckin' plan.
Why didn't you just handcuff her?
She was already dead.
That's still no reason to mutilate her.
She killed herself!
I just made it more dramatic.
Yeah.
Well, you better hope your dramatics don't put us in jail.
(SIGHS)
Look.
Just lean on 'em a little bit.
Marty will break.
Maybe Luke, too.
Look.
Don't tell me how to do my work.
All right?
We've questioned them all.
I got no reason to believe they've been lying.
Plus, all your friends have alibis.
Alibis?
Not for this morning, they don't.
COHAGAN:
We got Luke Seacord and Chris Vanowen together at breakfast.
We got Marty Landry at his office.
All right?
VINCENT:
At his office?
Look, for at least an hour this morning, we were all in the loft.
So was Phil.
What about Phil?
Actually, he's downstairs right now with his father-in-law.
Fry?
What the fuck's Fry doing here?
He just gave a statement, saying that he was with his son-in-law all day.
That is bullshit!
That is a false statement!
HUGGINS:
And why would he lie?
Hiram Fry brings a lot of credibility.
"Credibility"?
I saw Fry in San Diego with some bimbo!
Okay?
Phil knew that.
He knew I pressured Fry into giving me a waterfront contract.
So you tried to blackmail Hiram Fry?
COHAGAN:
Mr. Stevens, enough of this crap.
We got your prints all over the DVDs, we got 'em all over the knife.
We got you chained next to the dead girl on the bed.
All right?
Call your lawyer, make a confession and save your ass!
You're free to go.
I want to thank you for your cooperation.
You understand we had to check out your friend's story.
Of course.
It's your job.
There's just...
There's one thing that's bothering me.
Why does Vincent Stevens keep accusing his best friends?
I don't know.
It bothers me, too.
Hmm.
Could it be, I just wonder, do you think he's trying to hide something else?
What would he be hiding?
Sarah Deakins' murder.
Murder?
The detective in the interrogation called it a suicide.
Well, that's what it looked like.
But the autopsy report revealed that sleeping pills didn't kill her.
And her wrist was cut, but not by Sarah.
Hesitation marks, those tentative attempts...
The first ones before a suicide actually slashes through an artery.
The coroner didn't find those on her.
But Vincent, he would never...
His prints are on the knife.
We didn't find a suicide note.
Is there something wrong?
(RAINDROPS PATTERING)
HUGGINS:
We didn't find a suicide note.
LUKE:
You have the suicide note, right?
CHRIS:
I got it.
CHRIS:
Luke.
(CHUCKLES) Chris.
You scared me.
Sure it's smart, meeting here?
I think we have a problem, Luke.
How so?
Where's Sarah's suicide note?
You put it in your pocket.
Yeah, I could've sworn I did, but it's not there anymore.
So when did you steal it from my coat?
When the doorbell rang this morning?
Surprise visit from the realtor?
Chris, it's...
It's unfortunate that you lost Sarah's suicide note, but I had nothing to do with that.
I called the agency to ask who put our loft up for sale.
All they could give me was a number.
(DIALING)
(CELL PHONE RINGING)
I did call them.
I wanted...
I thought maybe that...
(CHUCKLES)
It's over, Chris.
We pulled it off.
We got nothing to worry about now.
But Why'd that note disappear?
The only real proof of her suicide.
(BELL BUZZES)
CHRIS:
Hello?
Says she's got an appointment with someone named Sarah Deakins.
MARTY:
Who's Sarah Deakins?
CHRIS:
ls it because maybe she didn't write it?
Maybe it's your handwriting.
Vincent fucked us all.
You saw...
Yeah, I saw.
All the DVDs that made everybody crazy went right along with your grand plan, didn't it?
But why, Luke?
What did you do to that girl?
Did she get in your way, between you and Vincent?
Actually, it was Vincent standing between us.
Is there someone else?
LUKE:
I'm not cheating on you, Ellie.
Sarah, wait!
Forget Vincent.
He is better at games than you.
Always was, always will be.
(PANTING)
He's hurting you, using you.
Why are you telling me this?
I'm telling you, because I'd never hurt you.
If you'd just give me the chance.
To show I'd never hurt you.
That's right, you'd never hurt me.
Because I feel nothing for you, Luke.
I'm sorry.
(SIGHS)
Maybe in another life.
You were here last night.
Barbara was off skiing.
So I figured I'd find Vincent here, with Sarah.
I'm sorry.
(SOBBING)
LUKE:
I waited till he left.
She said I was right about Vincent.
(SNIFFLES)
Consoling.
I've gotten so good at it.
(GROANS)
I gave her an insulin OD.
It's quick.
Painless.
Leaves no trace.
Jesus, Luke.
LUKE:
I did it out of love.
I swear.
And Vincent taking the fall for this?
That's okay with you?
(YELLING) Vincent used everyone and anyone!
It's about time we turned the tables!
Well, he's being charged with murder.
Yeah.
Sarah wasn't dead when we left her with Philip.
No.
No.
You're lying.
No.
That's not possible.
(BREATHING HEAVILY)
(PHILIP GRUNTS)
What Philip did to her was sick!
You're sick, Luke.
But, if I'm hearing you right, it was your brother who killed Sarah.
Okay, Chris.
Go home.
I'll clean up.
Like always.
No.
No more cleaning up, Luke.
Step outside.
Luke.
Now.
CHRIS:
Jesus.
Let me help you, Luke.
Please!
You're gonna kill me, too?
It's your own fault.
What do you want me to do?
Jump?
Yes.
If you don't mind.
(CHUCKLES)
Luke, you don't need to do this.
Jesus Christ, Luke!
Will you stop it?
I don't want to hurt you, Chris.
I really don't.
So just do it.
Now!
(INDISTINCT SIREN WAILING)
I called the cops before I came.
I told them everything.
Bullshit.

He wants you close, but not too close,
Not when there are important people around him,
I Told you I fell for the wrong, Can you keep a secret?
Ouur City Council man likes to keep my panties with him at these events in his pocket,
It's a turned on for him,
The thought of me in a crowd so naked, only he knows,

Maybe telling you about it it's turns me on even more ,
Hope you get cold,
Chris,
- Chris, Chris i am sorry, I don't know,May be i was just testing you

Listen, Do you want May be get a cup of coffee, some place quiet,private?
I would like to use your key, just once, It's not what you think,
It does not matter what I think, Have fun,
- Does every one still have a key?
- Of cours we do,
It is crucially we get this right, Five keys were cut,
To make a sixth you'd need a code, which is in my safe, Have to rob that out
There was no break-in, so does everyone still have a key?
well you think we have been given away our keys?
It's against your rules, Vince,
Then show me, What are we trying to prove here?
I do not know, maybe someone lost his key, lets just rule that out,ok?
Look Here's mine, Right?
Chris?
You did not use a key to get enter,
- no I bring it,
- Where is it?
I have it on me, I do not need it every day, Like you guys
But do you still have it?
whether if I've my key on me right now or not is not important,

Someone got in using a key, and your's are missing,
Is that right Vincent?

So It is just cut the bullshit coz it's definetly head we one of us five,
Unless ,
- Unless what?
- Unless she let him in,
O yaa?
How'd she get him in vincent?
Anyway you look at it always coming back down to us, and I want to know who is hiding something?
- Is there a word for that?
- Yes, polyamory,
A philosophy believe system about being romantically involved with more than one person at the same time,
And your boss get away with that?
Yes, he says he is in love with his wife and girlfriend, so why should he'd to choose,
- His wife is, amazingly cool of that,

You can barely handle a one woman, what would you do with two?
Bare one,

Something bisexual ,
Could you at least fake with some enthusiasm?

Watching his wife is not it?
Actually she was just cool enough to catch him in the act, She hired a detective, cell Phone records, credit card receipts, audio video in the work,
And abruptly my poor boss went from polyamory to alimony,
Your boss sounds really retarded, So what happened to him?
He and his concubine now sits in a tiny one-bedroom condo -

How can men stand fake breast?

It is not that simple ,

You're right, it's not that simple,
- But maybe I can make it simple,
- What do you mean?
Maybe I can help you to make her choice,
Sarah,
Sarah,
Sarah,
Sarah,
Sorry!
Are you alright?
Do not do it, Sarah, you're regret,
They have figured it out,
The women, they did it,
Why, Vincent?
They found it, They found out about the Loft,
Why did you do that, Vincent?
We are your friends,
Why did you do it?
The women, they found out,
We are your friends, we found out about,
What is going on?
- Okay, let's strip him,
- What are you doing?
You are totaly fucking sick in the head,
- I did what you told me,
- I told you to fucking cut her open
It was not part of the plan, and now let us hope the police will believe it,
- You should have done this themselves,
- Com on just do this,
What have you done?
You kill sarah?
No, we just found her,
We were here this morning before you arrived,
Jesus Christ,
At first I thought she was asleep,
Vincent knows her,
She left this,
See you in the next life,
Why would she have to do it here?
We have to call the Cops,
They Investigate suicide, Thsi is all gonna come out
Wait, Can we find out where she lives and leave her there?
- Com on,We have to help out Vince,
- But the problem is this- where the fuck is vince?
Is not this his problem?
Vincent is not here, because I have not called him,
You have not called him?
Why not you called him?
There is something I have to show you,
You Betraying us?
You fucking pervert
You can turn up me later, We don't have much time, and we need to watch this,
It will give you a new perspective by what happened here on Upstairs, may be you'll agree we should help vincent for this Fuck up,
You see, Vincent has not always been a good friend,
Maybe I've already got the naughty , may be With Vincent you sent him that evening,
She got her later the night , He came to talk to her,
She was drunk when he took advantage
Your little sister is seriously hot
- How long?
- It does not matter,
How long?
He starts seeing her right after your weeding They met here on regular basis,
If I'm not mistaken, he was her first,
Gorgeous huh?
The people you love, they are the only one that can hurt you,
He paid her, to let you seduce her,
For the hook you would share the loft,
It was the first once paid for,
Have fun,
Chris, you have no idea what you're talking about, Take just home,
He used your, Chris, Just like he used everyone, everyone,
I am gonna kill that son of bitch
It just can't sense anything is up when he walks in, we have to try in remain calm,
- We are being questioned by police,
- We can not admit to share in this loft,
They will try to turn us against each other,
Okay, I think this can work, As long we follow the plan,
- Chris - ok I am in,
But only if we are know for sure, Vincent was here last night,I wanna here him say it
And it does loke through then -
- I give a signal, break something, a glass -
- But nothing happens until we know for sure, Understood?
We got than just two hours to set everything that will help us,
I'll take care of it, You guys get out of here Make sure people see you,
- You have the suicide letter, right?
- i got it
You knew what the bring it up to, And you never said anything,
You are just as sick as Vincent,
They met here on reguler basis,
Vincent has never been a good friend,
He started seeing her right after the wedding,
If I'm not mistaken, he was her first,
You are a totally fucking psychopath,
- I did what you told me,
- I didn't tell you not to fucking cut her open,
It was not part of the plan, Only with the handcuffs to the bed,
What happened here?
You are "enemy",
Swallow it,
My old friends,
- Will I gonna die?
- No, Vincent, you are not gonna die
Sarah lured you here?
and drugged you,
And she killed herself, with you by her side,Fate will unite us
But you gonna survive,
Because we're friends, aren't we?
So you can see that it was a setup Sarah and I was setup, the whole things are staged
- It sounds unbelievable, do not you think?
- unbelievable But it's the truth,
My line of work, you gonna prove the truth , And the prove is what the facts we finding
Fact is that we only find is your fingerprints and Sarah Deakins,
They dried the place clean,
And we have the DVDs with your sexual pursuits, with your prints all over them,
Luke made those DVD's, I neither even saw nor touched them,
But we get no DVDs of your friends,
No DVD's of Marty's wife, No DVD's Philips sister,
No DVD's of Chris' girlfriend, Facts and findings, Mr, Stevens,
We get no evidence that you were being up,
Is there something we forgotten?
To follow the fucking plane, Why did not you just handcuffed her?
- She was already dead,
- Still Not reason to mutilate her,
She killed herself, I just made it more dramatic,
You better hope that your drama does not put us in jail,
Just lean over them a little bit, Marty will break, may be, Luke too,
Do not taught me how to interogate alright?
, We questioned them, I get no reason that they have been lying,
- finds all your friends have an alibies,
- Alibies?
how's for this morning,
We have Luke Seacord and Chris Vanowen together at breakfast,
We get Marty Landry at his office, at his office?
look, at least an hour in the morning, we were all in the Loft,
- So was Philip,what about Philip?
- He is downstairs right now with his father-in-law,
Fry?
What is fuck is fry doing here?
He just gave statement, Saying that he was with his son-in-law together all day,
- That is bull shit,that was a false statement
- And why would he lie?
Hiram Fry has a lot of credibility,
I saw Fry, in San Diego, with some bimbo,
Philip knew that , he knew I pressing Fry to give me a water front contract,
So you tried to blackmailed Hiram Fry?
Vincent Stevens, enough for describe,
We get your imprint all over the DVDs, we get them all over the knife, you were chained to the dead girl on the bed,alright?
Called your lawyer make a concession and save your ass,
You free to go, And thanks for your cooperation,
You understand, that we had to check out your friends,
Of course, that's your job,
There is just one thing that's bothering me,
Why does Vincent Stevens keep accusing his best friends?
I do not know, It bothers me too,
Could it be ,?
I just wonder ,
Can he hide something else?
- What would he hiding?
- Sarah Deakins murder,
Murder?
Detective in interrogation called that it a suicide,
How it is a look like, But the autopsy report tells that sleeping pills did not kill her,
Her wrists were cut up, but not by Sarah,
Hesitation work with tentative attemts,A person's first cuts to their arm when slashing their wrist,
- And these we didn't find on her,
- Vincent ,he,would never ,
- His fingerprints are on the knife,
We did not find a suicide note,
Is there anything wrong?
We did not find a suicide note,
- You have the suicide letter, right?
- I got it,
Luke,
You scared me,
You sure it is smart to meeting here?
I think we have a problem, Luke,
How so?
Where is Sarah's suicide note?
- You put it in your pocket?
- Yes, but it's not there anymore,
So when did you steal it from my Coat?
When the doorbell rang this morning -
- Surprise visit from the real estate?
Chris, its unfortunate that you lost Sarah's suicide note -
- But I had nothing to do with them,
I called the agencies to ask who put the Loft up for sale,
All they could give me was this number,
I did called them, I thought ,
What if ,
It's over, Chris, We pulled it off, We have nothing to worry aout now,
Why did that note disappeared?
The only real proof that she committed suicide,
Listen , We must ,
Sarah Deakins ,
Is it because may she did not write it?
Maybe it's your handwriting?
Vincent Fucked us all You saw it
Yes, I saw it, All the DVDs that made everybody crazy,
- But right long with your grand plan Didn't we?
But why, Luke?
What did you do to that girl?
She came in your way?
Between you and Vincent?
actually it was Vincent, stand between us,
Is there someone else?
He is much better than you,
Sarah!
Wait,
Forget Vincent, He is better games than you,
He has always was and always will be,
He is hurting you, Using you,
Why are you telling me?
I am telling you because , I would never hurt you,
Just give me the chance, To show that I will never hurt you,
That's right, You can never hurt me, Because I feel nothing for you, Luke,
I'm sorry,
Maybe in another life,
You were here last night?
Barbara was out and ski, So I I thought that I could find Vincent here,
- And Sarah,
- I'm sorry,
I waited until he left -
- She said I was right about Vincent,
Cpnsoling, I have become so good at it,
CI gave her insulin overdose 929 01:27:05,616 -- 01:27:09,070 Quick, painless, Leaves no trace,
Jesus, Luke,
I did it her for love, I swear
An Vincent taking the fault for this, It's okay with you?
Vincent used everyone and anyone!
It was his turn to what he did
Yes, now he is been charged with murder
Sarah was not dead, when you left her with Philip,
No,no, you're lying,
It is not possible,
What Philip did to her was sick,
You are sick, Luke,
But if what I hear is right -
- So it was your brother , Who killed sarah
Okay, Chris, Go home, I'll clean up,
Like always,
No , -
- No more cleanup, Luke,
Go outside, Now,
Let me help you, Luke,
- Will you kill me too?
- It's your own fault,
- What do you want to me?
jump?
- Yes, if you don't mind!
Luke!
You do not do it, Luke, will you Stop it?
I will not hurt you, Chris, I really not,
- Then just do not,
- Never!
I called the cop before I came, I told them everything,
- A lie!
I know you havn't,
- I thought I knew you,
What about the note?
You want it to go down with me too?
Give it to me, Chris, Give it to me,
It's over, Luke,
You are right, It's over,
Tell Allie and the kids, I'm sorry, would you do that for me, Chris?
- No,
- Come on, Chris, Be a friend,
Luke!
Luke!
Luke!
- They are married,
- Honey, no, hey're having an affair,
- Because she laughs at his jokes?
- No, I'm telling you that they're having an affair,
Since when are you the big expert on affairs?
Really ,for taking me back mimi,
That was my only alternative, Otherwise would you stand and cry at the front door,
Sorry, Do we scare you out?
I have the kids tomorrow, so I gotta go,
If you leave me here alone?
With my wife?
- We can get at leastone more drink,
- There will be plenty more drinks,
- Goodnight you two
- Good night, Chris,
Chris!
- Anne?
- Hi,
Hi,
- You look good,
- Thanks, you too,
Listen, I still have the key, Do you want it back?

I swear to God I had nothing to do with this.
[ Woman ] We would love to believe you, Mr. Stevens, but you have to admit... your version of events does sound pretty bizarre, don't you think?
Look.
It was a setup, okay?
The whole thing was staged.
So you were framed.
That's your claim?
You were the victim.
Well, I mean, you know, not-- not like--
[ Woman ] Not like who?
Not like her?
Please, just talk to the other guys.
Have you talked to the others yet?
[ Woman ] We're doing our jobs.
[ Man ] So why don't you just do yourself a favor and confess?
Save some time, save some legal fees.
Come on.
[ Woman ] Why don't you take us through the events of this morning?
Again?
Again, Mr. Stevens.

[ Man ] Where were you this morning, Mr. Stevens?
I was at home, alone.
My wife's taken the kids skiing.
Actually your wife's on her way back, as we speak.
Apparently, she has, uh, quite a few questions of her own.
[ Woman ] So the phone woke you around what time this morning?
I don't know.
Uh, 9:00, 9:30.
It was Luke in a panic.
He said I had to come.
[ Man ] Where were you supposed to go?
To the loft.
He told me to come to the loft.
Did he say why he was panicking?
- No.
- Did you know why he was panicking?
No, not yet.
Luke.
Luke?
Oh, my God.
Oh, fuck.
- What the hell happened?
- I don't know.
What do you mean?
You just-
- What, you--
I walked in, she was lying there.
Oh, fuck.
- Have you called the others?
- Chris and Marty are on their way.
I-
- I still haven't reached Philip.
Okay, well, uh, keep calling.
We need everybody here.
[ Luke ] Do you know who she is?
Vincent, do you know who's lying there?
What?
No, of course not.
How the fuck did they get in?
Was it a window, a door or--
Windows are sealed, the door was locked, and the alarm was turned off.
That's impossible.
I'm telling you, the door was locked.
And the alarm was turned off.
But that would mean that--
Someone got in with one of our keys.
[ Woman ] Do you know the loft building... at the corner of Second and South Hope, Mr. Seacord?
No.
The new residential one by the Sports Arena?
Designed, I believe, by your good friend Vincent Stevens.
Vincent runs a very large firm.
He's done a lot of buildings.
There's a loft on the ninth floor, Mr. Seacord.
Have you ever been there?
No.
Strange, because according to our information, you and four friends are sharing this loft secretly, without your wives' knowledge.
That is ridiculous.
Don't the five of you bring women up there?
Girlfriends, mistresses, one-night stands, catch of the day.
Five pals just looking for privacy and fun... without the hassle of Visa statements and hotel bills the missus might find.
That is preposterous.
Maybe, Mr. Seacord, but one of your friends already made a full confession.
You want to know who?
Listen, I don't do things like that.
You know?
Fool around with other women.
I--
[ Woman ] You love your wife.
I love my wife, yes.
What happened to your face, Mr. Seacord?
- I walked into a door.
- Or were you in a fight?
- I said I walked into a door.
- Where were you this morning?
Out with Chris, having breakfast.
There will be a lot of people in the restaurant to verify that.
By Chris, you mean Dr. Chris Vanowen, the psychiatrist?
- That's right.
- One of your loft buddies?
Chris is married.
He's got two kids.
And he's not a guy who cheats on his wife either.
[ Knocking ]
We've got a serious fuckin' problem, Chris.
Oh, shit.
Philip.
Philip?
You think your brother has something to do with this?
No.
We gotta call the cops.
You realize what'll happen if we call the cops?
- Think about our wives.
- There's a dead woman here, Vincent.
Why do we think Philip is involved?
- Chris, you know what he's capable of.
- Yeah, I know.
Maybe we can help him, okay?
If we can just figure out what the fuck happened, maybe we could--
What?
We gonna dump the body somewhere?
Look, I don't fucking know, but I'm not taking the fall for this!
Marty.
Son of a bitch.
Have you seen Phil?
Do you know where he is?
Was he here last night?
This can't be real.
No.
Wait, what are you doing?
I want to see her.
Just put her back.
- Goddamn it.
- [ Vincent ] Who is she?
I don't know.
Look, none of us has anything to do with this, right?
Right?
We're gonna find out what happened here, and we will figure a way out.
We're in this together.
We'll get out of it together.
Okay?
'Cause we're friends.
Agreed?
Agreed?
Well, it looks like they'll let anybody in, right?
Congratulations, man.
Thanks.
- This one's really spectacular, very special.
- I appreciate that.
Ally, it's been too long.
You look terrific.
Thank you.
So, uh, what do you think?
Well, it's bold and focused, as always.
- I like it.
- Great.
You made it.
Hi.
Hi.
- Hi, Barbara.
How are you?
- Want to buy yourselves a little condo?
I think Vincent's little condos are a little out of our league.
Right.
You and your puny psychiatrist's salary.
You guys grab a drink and we'll catch up with you later.
All right.
Congrats, bud.
Thanks, man.
One hour tops, and then we're out of here.
Come on, hon.
We just got here.
Man, check out all these babes.
So hot!
It's like they're in violation of the fuckin' fire code.
Marty, calm down.
I see them.
I can also see Mimi, your wife.
Okay, save me, help me, protect me.
What's up, Tubs?
Having too much fun?
Nope.
Just checkin' out the hipster crowd with my pal Luke.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, if you embarrass me, I'll leave you here all by yourself.
Oh, don't raise my hopes only to dash them.
[ Laughing ] Hi, Luke.
Where's Ellie?
She was just feeling dizzy.
Ducked out to check her blood sugar.
[ Mimi ] Hi, Elle.
Do you feel okay?
Oh, I started to feel not so great before, but I'm better now.
We can always go home, sweetie.
Did you hear that? "Sweetie." After she just checked her blood sugar.
That's funny.
That's really good.
I would love to see you deal with something like that if that was me.
Oh, you know, baby.
I'd love to stick you in the ass every day.
How many times have I asked?
Honey?
Lots.
[ Mimi ] Not now.
You're the shrink, aren't you?
Uh, yeah, that's right.
Chris Vanowen.
Dr. Vanowen.
That's right.
Yes, I remember.
Do we know each other?
No.
You knew my sister.
She was a patient of yours actually.
Sophie?
Sophie Morris?
Oh.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
Some people are just born unhappy.
I'm sorry.
Are you buying an apartment?
What?
Um, no.
No, no.
I'm friends with the architect.
Oh.
Are you?
No.
No, I'm here with, uh, Joel Kotkin, the city councilman.
I work for him as sort of a personal assistant.
Oh.
I'm Anne.
Anne Morris.
Very nice to meet you, Anne.
And listen, about your sister--
It's okay.
You couldn't have saved her.
Her mood disorder kind of runs in the family, unfortunately, so--
Well, you're not thinking of doing something stupid, are you, Anne?
Me?
You mean like falling for the wrong man?
Well, I do that all the time.
[ Glass Shattering ]
Everything's all right!
Come on.
Keep partying.
- What are you doing?
- Phil, I should've guessed.
Hey, Vince.
What's up?
Hey.
How are you?
Thanks for comin'.
I'm sorry about this.
She slipped.
No worries.
As long as you're okay.
You all right?
I'm fine.
She's fine.
Let me introduce you to uh, a colleague who works with me at the office.
And this one works with me down at the office.
Or is it the other way around?
Philip.
Oh, my big brother.
How you doin', man?
Friends of Vicky's?
Bridesmaids?
Come on, man.
I'm still single.
What are you doing?
It's not like I don't love my little Vicky.
I love her madly.
You know that.
All right?
It's not like I hate all the other women in the world.
- All right.
Relax.
- There's something I want to show you.
Let's go get Marty and Luke.
Chris.
Gentlemen, welcome to the loft.
Wow.
This is impressive, Vince.
Check out the view.
Then imagine this is our own private oasis right in the heart of downtown.
- What do you mean?
- A place where no one hassles you.
A place you can escape to any time you want.
- So this is your loft?
- No.
It's ours.
If you want it.
What?
Ours?
Think about it.
No messy hotel bills.
No questionable credit card activity.
This would be our secret place... to steal away, discreetly and economically... in these challenging times.
Five-way split.
What do you think?
I don't know.
I'm not like that.
Come on, Chris.
We're men.
We're all a little like that.
Yeah, tell me about it.
Give me your key right now.
Bring your twins up here, give 'em a little private tour.
- You know what they cost?
- How much?
I might have it on me right now.
Seriously.
Think about it.
It's a great investment.
A once-in-a-lifetime golden opportunity.
- I can't stay here.
- Where are you going?
- Luke!
- You cannot freak out right now.
We have to stay together like we said.
All right.
Luke, you need to calm the fuck down.
No!
No!
It's over, Vincent!
It's all gonna come out!
It's not over.
Listen.
We're gonna find out what happened here and fix it.
Okay?
Try Phil again.
[ Beeps, Speed Dialing ]
[ Line Ringing ]
This is Philip.
Please leave a message after the tone.
What if he doesn't show?
He could be out of the country by now.
He'll show.
We can't cover for him, Chris.
Not this time.
Guys?
Look at this.
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
[ Man ] You know Latin, Doctor?
Excuse me?
Latin.
Do you know Latin?
I took it premed, yeah.
What's it say on the wall there?
Fatum nos iungebit.
Yeah, I know.
Fatum nos iungebit.
I can read that.
What's it mean?
I'm guessing you already know what it means.
No.
We would like to hear you say it.
You'd like to hear me say it.
Okay.
Fatum nos iungebit.
Fate will unite us.
Now, all I can possibly think is that somebody who knows Latin like you... reached over with this young lady's hand... and wrote "Fatum nos iungebit" on the wall.
"Fatum nos iungebit" is wrong.
How so, Doctor?
The future imperfect tense of the verb unite, iungere... is not iungebit, it's iunget.
It should say "Fatum nos iunget."
So the person you're looking for made a classic Latin error.
But I'm guessing you knew that already too, didn't you?
You know the phrase "Fuck you"?
Germanic origin.
- Where's your brother?
- I'm sorry.
I can't help you with that one.
Right.
Actually, he's your half-brother, isn't he?
Same mother, different fathers.
He spent some time in various institutions with your half-sister Zoe?
Yeah, that's right.
After our mother died,
Philip wasn't-- wasn't as lucky with his father.
Apparently not.
Alcoholic child beater.
You didn't spend much time with Philip back then, did you?
- No.
- But now you're best friends.
We've had a lot of catching up to do.
You really don't know where we can find him?
[ Vincent ] Fate will unite us?
Where the hell's your brother, Chris?
I don't know.
What the hell is this?
- Where the fuck is Philip?
- I'm right here.
- What the hell's going on?
- You did this.
- You did this!
- Luke!
Luke, Luke!
- Luke!
Come here!
Hey!
Hey!
- Hands off!
Come on.
Bring it on!
- Cool it.
- What is this?
- Luke.
- Shit.
- Did you have anything to do with this?
- What you talkin' about?
- Just answer the fucking question!
Did you do this?
- Of course not!
- Jesus Christ.
Were you here last night?
No, man, I wasn't here last night.
I slept at my in-laws.
You don't believe me, call Vicky.
What about this morning?
Were you here this morning?
I was at a project site, all right?
With my father-in-law.
My God.
Where were you last night?
- Where've you been?
- Philip, take it easy.
Before accusing everyone else, where have you been?
'Cause I never got a text saying the loft was taken.
Never.
- Last night, I was at home.
- Can you prove it?
No, I can't prove it 'cause Barbara's taken the kids skiing.
- You'll have to take my word for it.
- Your word?
There's a dead woman in our loft that only us have access to.
Now, if anybody has anything to do with this, now's the time to say it, right now.
♪♪ [ Classical ]
Thank you for coming.
[ Marty ] Philip's got a ball and chain now.
[ Chuckles ]
Who would have thunk it?
Who's the father-in-law again?
His name's Hiram Fry.
He's a huge property developer.
[ Vincent ] His friends call him "the man of steel."
Worth millions.
Think she's his only daughter.
So what's not to love?
I just hope Philip will be happy.
Hi, you!
- Well, that's cozy.
- What?
Ever since Councilman Kotkin got elected, the man of steel's been busy rebuilding downtown.
[ Luke ] Kotkin came to your opening, right?
Yeah, he turned up for a photo op.
When it comes to handing out permits and contracts though, the game's rigged.
Tell me what we're talking about again 'cause I just saw some mini cheesecakes.
Gorgeous, huh?
I mean, this whole setup.
Whoever said money can't buy happiness sure hasn't lived this life.

Sorry, boys.
You lost your bachelor mascot.
He's all mine now.
Good luck with breaking this bronco, Vicky.
God knows others have tried.
- But I'm not others, am I, Philip?
- She told you!
It's not just me.
Philip's married into the Fry family now.
Soon as we're back from Fiji.
Yeah.
Well, gonna sell some properties with Vicky's dad.
You know, see how it grabs me.
Wow.
Grabs you.

Well, guys, thanks for coming.
[ Vincent ] Congratulations.
Come on.
I'll be with you in a second, baby.
I need a break from all the ass-kissing.
Shit.
[ Marty ] Where is Fiji?
I don't know, man.
[ Laughing ]
[ Laughing ] You look gorgeous!
Phil?
Your wedding present.
- Are you for real?
- Absolutely.
Don't lose it.
There's only five of these in existence.
Accepting a key to the loft means you accept the rules to the loft.
Marty?
Wow.
What, are you crazy?
Our wives are here.
[ Chattering ]
Don't you think that's a bit cynical, handing those things out here?
Cynical?
It's just a key to a room.
You should check it out.
Oh, no, you're not like that.
Not now.
Maybe later.
What about you, Luke?
Now or later?
Come on.
That-a-boy.
Oh, wow.
You just make sure this doesn't blow up in your faces.
How's it gonna blow up in our face?
It's just a room, like Vince said.
Our room.
Now, we keep it to ourselves, all right?
Tell nobody.
It just stays within our circle.
Marty?
Yeah?
Yeah.
You just need to find someone willing to go with you, Marty.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, yeah.
I think there's, uh, plenty choices right here.
Some of these guys bring some premium-grade high-test pussy.
Like that little dewy-eyed vixen right there.
- She looks underage.
- No, she's 20.
One of you guys messes with her, I'm gonna crack your head wide open.
What, do you got dibs on Miss Curly Locks?
Listen, man.
That's Zoe, all right?
Zoe?
Yeah.
Like as in skin-and-bones tomboy Zoe?
- [ Philip ] Yeah.
- Oh!
I hate to say it, Phil, but your little sister's seriously hot.
Thanks, man.
She's not little anymore.
- That is the finest piece of ass--
- Marty, that's enough.
I'm just saying, I'd like to fuck her like an animal.
- Come on, Marty.
That's enough.
- Feel her from the inside.
♪ I want to fuck you like an animal ♪
[ Grunts ]
You don't sing.
You don't laugh.
You don't talk about my sister.
Got it?
- Got it?
- Ow!
Don't fuck with me!
You watch it.
You watch it.
Kick your ass at your own fucking wedding.
- Hi.
- Hi.
We met at the, uh-- the building opening.
That's right.
You're Anne Morris.
I'm glad you remember me, Chris.
Hmm.
I see you work weekends.
What a dedicated personal assistant.
What a lucky city councilman.
[ Laughs ]
Screw him.
Do you?
[ Chuckles ]
Does it get a bit boring walking around all these parties by yourself?
He wants you close, but not too close.
Not when there's important people around.
I told you I fall for the wrong men.
Can you keep a secret?
Our city councilman... likes to keep my panties with him at these events, in his pocket.
It's a turn-on for him-- the thought of me in a crowd so naked.
Only he knows.
Why do you let him use you like that?
Who says he's using me?
Maybe it turns me on.
Maybe me telling you about it turns me on even more.
I hope you don't catch cold.
Chris.
Chris, I'm sorry.
I don't know.
Maybe I was testing you.
I don't need to be tested.
Listen, do you want to maybe get a cup of coffee... someplace quiet... private?
[ Applause ]
I'd like to use your key.
Just once.
It's not what you think.
Hey, it doesn't matter what I think.
Have fun.
- Does everyone still have a key?
- Course we do.
It's crucial we get this right.
Five keys were cut.
To make a sixth, you'd need the code, which is in my safe, so we can rule that out.
But there was no break-in.
So does everyone still have a key?
What, you think we've been givin' away our keys?
It's against your rules, Vince.
Then show me.
What are we trying to prove here?
Look, I don't know.
Maybe someone's lost a key, okay?
Let's just rule that out.
Okay?
Look.
Here's mine.
All right?
[ Keys Jangling ]
[ Vincent ] Chris?
- You didn't use a key to get in just now.
- [ Knocking ]
- No.
I didn't bring it.
- Where is it?
I don't have it on me.
It's not like I need it every day, like some of you guys.
But you do still have it?
Vincent, whether or not I have my key on me right now is really not important.
It's extremely fucking' important.
Someone got in using a key, and yours is missing!
Is that right, Vincent?
Then how do you account for the fact that the alarm was shut off?
So let's just cut the bullshit, 'cause it definitely had to be one of us five.
Unless--
Unless what?
Unless she let him in.
Oh, yeah?
Then how'd she get in, Vincent?
Any way you look at it, it keeps coming back down to us.
And I, for one, would like to know who's hiding something.
[ Mimi ] Where did you learn that?
I seriously don't believe it.
There's a word for that?
Yes.
Polyamory.
It's a philosophy, some sort of belief system... about being romantically involved with more than one person at the same time.
Uh-huh.
And your boss gets away with that?
Yes.
He says that he's in love with his wife and his girlfriend, so why should he have to choose?
- And his wife is amazingly cool with it.
- Oh, really?
Is she special needs?
Maybe oxygen-deprived?
What?
- Explain.
I'd like to know.
- This sounds like my kinda philosophy.
Barbara, what's it called again?
Polly and Marie?
Please.
Spare us, Tubs.
You can barely handle one woman.
What would you do with two?
Mmm.
Bury one.
I would make up something, some sort of game... that involves two ladies and one guy.
Start a trapeze act or somethin'.
[ Laughing ]
Could you at least fake some enthusiasm?
It's your party.
Anyway, I'm cooking.
If you absolutely have to invite your friends over, could you at least try to make it home on time?
Look, they're never here, okay?
Will you just join us?
[ Marty Cackling ]
I just hope the pudgy clown doesn't puke on the rug.
He's been chugging vodka like it's Evian.
I mean, doesn't his wife see that?
Actually, she was just cool with it long enough to catch him in the act.
She hired a detective.
Cell phone records, credit card receipts.
Audio, video, the works.
And in a heartbeat, my poor boss went from polyamory to alimony.
[ Mimi Laughing ] Oh.
[ Marty ] Man, your boss sounds mentally retarded.
So, what-- what happened to him?
Oh.
Uh, he and his concubine are now cramped in a tiny one-bedroom condo.
But I'm guessing he's happy.
She's blonde, 23, with a brand-new pair of fake breasts.
Oh!
How can men stand fake breasts?
Ah!
Why are women always talking about "fake tits" this, "fake tits" that?
I mean, listen.
Girls, if it's a decent boob job, who fuckin' cares.
You know?
My mom-
- My mom, she's got, uh, false teeth.
Okay?
When she smiles, do people give her shit and say,
"Oh, my God!
Look!
Fake!"
No, they don't.
They say, "Wow!
You look way better now.
It's an improvement."
You know, you women, you're so catty, so competitive.
Calm down, Tubby dearest.
You know what?
No, it's nothin' to be calm about, Mimi.
I mean, a glorious, big set of fuckin' tits... and a nice piece of ass, it's-it's thrilling!
It's thrilling!
This is all a little too highbrow for my teeny, tiny, catty female mind.
Oh, well, you know what?
You should have that enlarged.
Huh?
And while you're under, you should have the corners of your mouth lifted... so you can smile every once in a while.
Sorry.
Sorry, Chris.
What?
What?
Marty.
Marty.
- Come on.
- No.
[ Chuckles ]
No, you're a class act, Marty.
Mimi, would you like to get your husband another drink or should I do the honors?
You should do it.
And I want it chilled.
- And then you go with her and stir.
- Honey?
The problem with your boss, Barbara, is he didn't have his shit together.
I mean, apart.
Apart, I mean.
He did-
- No, I mean he didn't compartmentalize.
You guys agree?
All right, Marty.
How would you compartmentalize?
How?
Okay.
Well, since you ask.
First thing first is I wouldn't have a place that you could get caught.
Not a hotel, not your girlfriend's crib.
That's key, right?
Am I right, Vinnie boy?
Am I right?
Marty, you've lost us all.
[ Cackling ] I doubt that!
I doubt that, Vinnie boy.
But it-
- Okay, first of all-- Sorry, baby.
I would just get a little-- you know, a little one-bedroom condo... or something like that.
- Whoa, whoa!
- Goddamn it!
Oh.
You all right?
Mimi, your husband tends to talk out of his ass when he's been drinking.
Yeah?
All right.
There we go.
Hon, would you give me a hand?
Sure.
[ Snorting ]
- Sorry.
Didn't know you were in here.
- Yeah, no problem.
Ate too much too fast, I guess.
Thai food, you know.
Yeah, it gets all up in your nose and shit.
- Yeah.
It's a little spicy.
- Yeah.
I'm outta here.
Bye.
[ Exhales ]
- I need to pick up some more insulin.
- Luke?
Is there something you wanna tell me?
Are you keeping secrets?
What kind of secrets?
Is there someone else?
I don't know why you start asking me silly questions, but the answer is no.
I'm not cheating on you, Ellie.
That's not what I'm asking, Luke.
I'm asking if there's someone else.
[ Gasps ]
Listen, sweetie.
Whatever I may be or may not be-- and I know I'm not as glamorous as some-- but I'll always be there for you and the children.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
I want you to know... there's a lot I could put up with.
[ Luke ] What are you doing?
We need to get her out of here.
How?
She is shackled to the bed!
Can't you guys see what's going on?
Someone is trying to frame us.
Who?
Who wants to frame us?
I don't know.
But think about it.
The body's cuffed to the bed.
It's impossible to move.
The Latin, the knife.
Someone did this for a reason.
The cops could be here any second.
None of us know who this girl is.
We don't even know how she got in here.
Who else knew about the arrangement?
Who else knows about our arrangement?
Did anyone blab, tell one of the girls that have been up here?
Marty?
What?
Why me?
- Some night you were hammered?
- I've always followed the rules, Vincent.
Did you give anyone your code?
Did you key in while someone was watching?
Absolutely not.
I just told you.
Wait.
What's your point, Vincent?
Where are you going with this?
- Someone is trying to set us up.
- Like who?
I don't know.
A rejected girlfriend.
A jealous boyfriend.
Betrayed husband.
Someone with a motive.
Look.
Is one of you guys in some kind of trouble?
[ Moaning ]
[ Gasping ]
[ Laughs ]
I think I may be falling in love with you.
You don't have to say that.
No, but I mean it.
Why would you say that, Chris?
Why would you even feel it?
I've never cheated on my wife before.
And I don't fall in love easily.
Chris, I don't want you to love me.
You don't even know me... apart from these stolen moments.
I mean, they're exciting, yeah, sure, but... they're just moments.
Let's change that.
I wanna see you more often--
Chris, please.
- and not just for this.
- No, stop it.
I don't want you to love me.
Well, I don't wanna keep sneaking around.
I'm gonna tell Alison about us.
No, you're not.
Yes, I am.
Anne.
[ Sighs ]
I'm gonna leave her.
Stop it!
Why are you doing this?
The people you love, they're the only ones who can hurt you.
I would never hurt you, Anne.
Stop.
Stop what?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Would you--
Stop it, okay?
You don't know me.
That's the end of it.
No.
- Would you give me a chance, at least--
- I'm a whore.
All right?
What?
I'm a prostitute.
I fuck men for money.
Do you get it now?
Don't worry, Doctor.
I won't bill you for the past few months.
Please, Anne, would you wait?
Would you wait a minute?
Chris, please stop it.
You don't know the half of it.
Just go home.
Go home to your wife and your kids.
Is your friend Chris Vanowen cheating on his wife, Mr. Landry?
Oh, I doubt that.
Chris is a very devoted husband and, um--
And a model dad, just like all the rest of your pals, right?
Except for you.
You're not exactly squeaky clean, are you, Marty?
Um, I don't know what you mean.
- Why does your wife want a divorce?
- Divorce?
That's not right.
What we're going through is a separation.
It's a trial separation.
Why?
Because she found out something that she, uh, wasn't too happy about.
- You fucked around on her.
- If you wanna be technical.
How'd she find out?
- The woman with whom I--
- Fucked around?
Yeah.
Apparently expected something a little more, and she showed up on our front porch.
The bitch started to--
The woman in question started saying things.
And my only hope is that Mimi will come around eventually, because I love her very much.
Did you go with this woman up to the loft?
What?
No.
This happened in San Diego.
Oh, that's where you met the woman, right?
In San Diego.
- Yeah.
- Why were you there?
A commercial real estate convention.
Vince had a couple extra tickets.
A VIP thing, you know.
It's a couple nights in a fancy hotel and a chance to get away for a couple days.
And nights.
Yeah.
Nights too.
Man, do you see that?
Jesus, Vince.
Those girls are drooling all over you.
Invite 'em over.
You got first dibs.
I'm happy with second best too.
He's cute.
See him?
I'll take a rain check on that.
What?
What, are you fucking crazy?
Why wouldn't you invite them over?
'Cause, Marty, I'd rather dive for some rare and exotic sea creature... than shoot fish in a barrel.
Does Barbara know about these deep-sea expeditions of yours?
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah.
What's your problem, Seacord?
You got a key to the loft.
What do you do up there, your laundry?
Dishes?
Hey, are you guys here on business or what?
I'm Dana.
My first time here.
It's a little overpriced for what you get, don't you think?
Hi, Dana.
I'm Vincent.
This is, uh, Marty, Luke.
Can we, uh, buy you a drink?
Hey, when I said "overpriced," I wasn't trolling for free booze.
- No, I mean, I didn't think--
- Since you asked, what are you drinking?
Oh, champagne?
A girl can dream.
- Champagne?
- Please.
All right.
One champagne coming up.
What are you doing?
The fat chick's gonna scare off all the hot chicks.
Marty.
Every fat chick has a good-looking friend.
Hers is probably on her way down right now.
Okay.
Yeah, well, what if she is the good-looking friend... and the really fat chick's on her way down?
I think that's Philip's father-in-law.
- [ Marty ] Oh.
Yeah, it is.
- I'll be.
That's the man of steel, all right.
But that ain't Mrs. Steel.
Think we should give him a key?
Maybe.
Not mine.
I'd like a bottle of your finest champagne and four glasses, please, at the table in the corner.
You, uh, were at my daughter's wedding.
Philip's friends.
You're the architect.
Vincent Stevens.
We should talk sometime, Mr. Stevens.
Sure.
What do you got in mind, Mr. Fry?
We have a new waterfront project.
It's massive.
It's cutting-edge.
It might be right up your alley.
Of course, it's all preliminary, and we have to keep it under wraps.
I hope you can be discreet.
Sure.
Discretion, Mr. Stevens.
That's the main thing.
Dictum sapienti sat est.

You tell me, Chris.
- Alison, I--
- I'm going to bed.

It's called following your dick around.
Okay, two kinds of articles in Cosmo month after month--
One: men are pigs.
Two:
How do I seduce a pig to chop my wood?
[ Dana Chuckling ] I don't read Cosmo month after month.
[ Marty ] Well, I do.
I don't.
Well, I do.
And I find it strangely compelling.
You know what I find strangely compelling?
What?
[ Marty ] Your eyebrows.
Lumberjack contest.
Oh.
I can't leave you alone for a minute.
Sarah.
It's been more like an hour.
Thank God I've been subsidized.
Aren't you going to introduce me to your new friends?
[ Female Detective ] And that was the first time you met her?
Yeah, that was, uh--
That was the first time.

Yeah.
Her name was Sarah.
[ Male Detective ] Mr. Stevens, what else happened in San Diego?
What do you want to know?
Everything.
[ Marty Laughing ] I got another one!
No!
No!
[ Vincent ] Shh!
[ Vincent ] Keep it down.
Keep it down.
This is insane, Sarah.
You should never dare a crazy woman.
Vincent, we should probably go back.
Luke, lighten up.
It's okay.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Said I'd get you to the pool.
Now you have to keep your end of the bargain.
Come over here.
Let's sit down.
Yeah.
Oh!
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Come on.
Don't keep us waiting.
Take it off.
- Think I'm gonna be sick.
- What?
Vince's body's not that bad.
Not Vince, the shrimp cocktail!
[ Marty ] What?
Dana!
Dana!
Come-
- Come back.
Come back here!
Your turn.
No.
Take it all off.
Not bad.
Is this still too scary for you, Luke?
Are you gonna join us?
I'm-- I'm fine right here.
But I need you, 'cause Vincent's gonna try and make a move on me soon.
And if you're here, maybe he won't dare.
Well, maybe Vincent's not interested.
Maybe Vincent would rather do laps.
[ Chuckles ]
That would explain the last few hours of casual-but-meaningful glances... that each lasted a second too long.
You like to play games, huh?
Tsk.
I do.
And I'll tell you something else:
I'm better at it than you.
Can you feel me?
Most definitely.

Dude!
I'm kinda busy here.
Don't stop!
Go!
[ Marty ] I'm not stopping.
Just do it!
Oh!

You're scared, is what it is.
You're running away from your feelings.
I don't want to say good-bye.
Do you have any idea what it's like to really love someone?
I'm sorry.

What are you doing?
Throwing it away.
It's empty.
You were here yesterday, weren't you?
Guys?
We gotta go to the cops.
We're not getting anywhere with this.
First, I think Vincent has something to tell you.
All right, let's hear it.
- [ Doorbell Buzzing ]
- What the hell?
- [ Chris ] Hello?
- Who is it?
Who is it?
It's a Realtor who wants to come up.
Somebody listed the loft for sale?
- What?
- Oh, Jesus fucking--
Listed the loft?
She said she has an appointment with a Deakins, Sarah Deakins.
Who-
- Who's Sarah Deakins?
Wait.
Who the hell is trying to sell our loft?
You know her, Marty.
- What?
- You know her, and so does Luke.
Sarah Deakins is lying on the bed.
You guys, I promise, I've never seen a Sarah Deakins.
- That's not true.
You know her.
- Why do you keep saying that?
You met her in San Diego the last night in the bar.
Remember?
Dana's friend.
The last night?
I was wasted outta my mind.
The whole night's a blur.
[ Doorbell Buzzes ]
Jesus!
Luke, you remember her, don't you?
That's Sarah?
You remember Sarah.
You remember her, right?
Yes.
I remember Sarah.
But how was I supposed to know that's Sarah?
Come on, guys.
What the hell's going on?
You guys turned her over and looked at her face.
- I did not.
- [ Doorbell Buzzing ]
Yeah.
I think there's been a mistake.
We don't know anyone named Sarah Deakins.
Marty.
Come on!
- Who is it?
Do we know her?
- I don't know.
Fuck.
So is that all you wanted to tell us, Vince?
Or is there more?
I had a thing with her.
I brought her up here a couple of times.
But I swear on my kids, I had nothing to do with this.
Would you just fuckin' tell me?
Were you here with her last night?
Were you the one who let her in?
I broke up with her last night.
I swear she was alive when I left.
It still doesn't explain why someone listed the loft!
Something special or just browsing?
Why don't you return my phone calls?
If you're dumping me, at least have the decency--
Chris, how can I dump you?
There's nothing between us.
So that's what it meant to you?
Nothing?
Did you forget what I told you already?
Who I am, what I do?
No.
I haven't.
It doesn't change how I feel about you.
How many women have you taken to that fuck pad you share with your four buddies?
What?
Please, Chris.
Save it for some girl who'll actually buy your bullshit.
Anne, no, wait.
Wait.
You know I'm not like that.
Here.
I only need this if I'm with you, so you keep it.
If you wanna see me again, you let me know.
[ Car Horn Honks ]
Chris?
Um, what are you doing here?
Shopping for Alison?
Uh, no.
No, um, I was just here with a colleague.
[ Female Detective ] Does your wife know you've been sharing the loft with your pals?
[ Luke ] I already told you, I'm not sharing a loft with any pals.
I was there just once, at a party, when the building first opened.
Then you have been there.
A minute ago, you didn't even know where the building was.
I never took anyone up there.
I thought that's what you meant.
Well, did you know the girl?
We met once in San Diego.
Are you aware that Mr. Stevens began a relationship with her in San Diego?
That would surprise me, frankly.
You didn't know?
Isn't Vincent Stevens your best friend?
It's so obvious what you're trying to do here.
You're trying to turn us against each other.
But guess what?
I'm not about to start trashing my friend.
Is it possible, Mr. Seacord, that you are jealous of your best friend... when he's nailing all these beautiful women?
I am a married man.
I'm not interested in nailing women.
I'm not jealous of Vincent.
Oh, no.
I didn't mean jealous of him, Mr. Seacord.
I meant jealous of the women.
Where do you get off with an innuendo like that?
Fucking bastards.
Why are you so angry, Mr. Seacord?
Vincent is my closest friend.
And he has been for years.
[ Male Detective ] Yeah, fine.
But your best friend is selling you out as we speak, Mr. Seacord.
You and the rest of your gang.
No.
Vincent would never sell out his friends.
You're full of shit, asshole.
What'd you call me?
You heard me, you lying piece of shit!
I broke up with her and I left!
That's it!
Yeah?
- After you cut her up with this.
Right?
- Put the knife down!
- I didn't kill her.
- Back off.
- What?
- Put the knife-- Put the knife down!
Back off.
What?
What?
The loft was listed in her name.
That's not a coincidence.
- Someone's trying to pin this on us.
- On you, you mean.
Jesus!
Get a fuckin' grip!
Fuck!
Guys, we cannot keep doing this.
Well, what do you wanna do, Marty?
Huh?
Just leave me hanging?
Hey, Vince?
Vince?
Are you in there?
If you're in there, hey, man, I need to talk to you for just a second.
Christ, Marty, I've got company.
Didn't you get my text?
Mimi's gone.
[ Whimpering ] She's gone.
Fucking gone.
What do you mean "gone"?
Gone where?
She left me.
She found out about San Diego.
That dumpy chick, she showed up and then told her everything.
Fuck!
Wait a minute.
You didn't tell Mimi about the loft?
What?
It's not about the goddamn loft, Vince!
It's about my wife!
[ Sobbing ] I don't know what I'm gonna do without her!
Did you-- Did you confess?
Then never confess, Marty.
Never confess.
Would you go to her and just-- just tell her that I love her?
You know?
And that Dana's lying?
She'll believe you.
Marty, I will straighten this out for you.
I promise you I will straighten this out.
Okay.
Hey, come here.
Okay.
[ Sobbing ]
Thanks.
[ Chris ] Okay, so what's the plan?
What do we do now?
We get her out of here.
We can't just make a body disappear.
That's too bad.
It's our only hope.
You had a relationship with her.
Now she's some inconvenient piece of evidence?
- What kind of man are you?
- That's a laugh, coming from you.
And how do you plan to get her off the bed?
Cut off her hand?
Or do you have the key to those cuffs?
I thought handcuffs were more your thing than mine, Phil.
Meaning what?
You know exactly what I mean.
[ Phil Shouting ]
[ Woman Sobbing, Whimpering ]
[ Phil ] Shut up!
Shut up!
Just keep your fuckin' mouth shut!
All right?
Please help-- help me!
Please help me!
Keep that fucking mouth shut!
[ Whimpering, Sobbing Continue ] He's crazy!
This fucking whore's trying to rip me off!
- Please help me!
He raped me!
- Shut up!
Hey.
Hey.
Easy, easy!
What?
- All right.
All right.
- It's gonna be okay.
He's crazy!
[ Sobbing ]
Shit.
Okay, okay.
- Philip, give me the keys.
- Bitch is gonna go to the cops, man.
- The keys.
- She's gonna go to the cops!
The keys!
- You want the key?
- [ Sobbing Continues ]
- Shit.
- He made me do things I didn't want to do.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Easy.
Easy.
What?
You want more money?
That's it, right?
It's all about the money, huh?
It's all about the fucking money!
Here's your fucking money!
It's right there!
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck is the matter with you?
Have you lost your fucking mind?
She's a whore, Chris!
Do you know what a whore is?
Shut up!
- You can't rape a whore!
- Shut up!
- You can't rape a--
- Shut up!
You don't treat a woman like that!
You got it?
Not any woman!
- Don't fuckin' touch me!
- What the fuck's the matter with you?
You're putting us all at risk!
I want police.
He-
- He hit me.
- Shut-- - [ Woman Shouts ]
- He raped me!
- Shut up!
Stop screaming, or I'm gonna rip your goddamn throat out!
I've had it with you.
You're no better than your father.
- I'm what?
- You heard me.
Oh, right, Chris.
That's a nice one.
Chris had a better deal with his daddy, right?
The great guy who wants to save everyone.
Where were you... when Zoe and I were getting beat up?
And Mom in the next room... pretending not to hear.
Where were you?
In your cozy college dorm... getting laid and wasted 'cause you didn't give a fuck!
I didn't know anything about it.
You didn't give a crap!
All those years we didn't exist for you!
I didn't know anything about it!
If you would've said something--
Then what, you phony?
Then what?
Then I would've gotten you out of there, goddamn it!
Both of you!
[ Sobbing ]
Listen.
I'm really, really sorry, but we can't go to the cops.
Here's what I'm gonna do.
I have a friend.
He's a doctor.
- No.
- Yes.
I'm gonna drive you to him.
He's gonna take care of you.
Okay?
No.
No.
Here.
Listen.
Take it.
I know it's not enough for what happened tonight, but--
He's an animal.
He should be locked up!
And we're gonna deal with him, I promise you.
Come on.
Get your clothes.
I'm gonna take you to the doctor.
- No!
- Easy.
Here we go.
No.
- [ Whimpers ] - [ Door Opens, Slams ]
I'll never forgive you for this.
Never!
What's the problem?
Jesus Christ!
Why don't I know anything about this?
- And when did it happen?
- A couple of weeks ago.
We decided to keep it to ourselves 'cause that's the kind of friends we are.
Don't lecture me, all right?
Especially about friendship.
Yeah, yeah, right.
Sorry.
I meant to give you the cokehead rapist lecture.
Fuck you.
Well, look.
You can see how I think you'd be involved in this.
I need to say something.
[ Door Slams ]
Oh, shit.
[ Grunts ]
You had that coming!
[ Philip ] Hey, come on!
Get up!
[ Chris ] Relax.
Take it easy.
- You son of a bitch.
- You recorded everything that went on here.
- Every woman--
- Not every.
Not always.
Just... sometimes.
At least I don't cheat on my wife.
No, you just watch us and beat off.
- You sick fuck.
- You're a sick fuck!
Luke, did you record last night?
No.
You didn't say you were coming, which is against your rules.
And that wasn't the first time you broke your own rules, by the way.
Now you're scared, aren't you?
Now you know I've documented pretty much everything you've been up to here.
No worries, Vincent.
I'll keep my mouth shut, like I always do.
Did you see anything that can help us out here?
Anything at all?
If all the people who've been hurt and cheated on find out the truth, what do you think'll happen, Vincent?
[ Chattering ]
[ Scattered Applause ]
What's the matter?
I just don't feel like leaving tomorrow.
Serious?
You love skiing.
Yes, I love to ski, but just not by myself.
Are you sure you can't come?
Babe, you know I can't come.
I can't just take off right now.
Hey.
I'll call you every day.
I love you.
I know the drill.
One hour, right?
Wrong.
Have a blast.
Don't mind me.
Why should tonight be any different from the past few months?
If it's all right with you, I'd rather not spoil tonight.
I'm sure it must be tempting to grab something shiny and new.
But do you ever think about what you might stand to lose, Chris?
You could ruin a lot more than just this evening.
Tell me.
Are you so happy, Alison?
[ Applause ]
Well, what do you know?
If it's for charity, my mother-in-law is allowed to join the party for a little while.
Heard anything about the waterfront project?
No.
He's gonna call once he gets his permits.
Now, as far as I know, everything's approved.
Really?
Yeah.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Ladies, you look absolutely ravishing tonight.
Thank you.
This is Vincent Stevens.
He's the architect who designed the new loft building near the sports arena.
Oh, wonderful.
I love that building.
Why, thank you, Mrs. Kotkin.
I really appreciate that.
As I was saying to your husband in San Diego, gentlemen in our business can't afford to be exposed... to the negative consequences of bad design.
Speaking of, uh, San Diego, how's that waterfront project coming along?
Ah, yes.
Uh, we're still working on it.
We've applied for all our permits and now we're waiting.
Standing in line like everyone else.
You don't strike me as the type of man that stands in line, Mr. Fry.
What about you, Mr. Kotkin?
Are you a gambling man?
And you, Mr. Stevens?
You like to take chances?
As a matter of fact, I do.
Especially when I'm holding a handful of hearts.
Anyway, I don't mean to interrupt.
Ladies, if you're as lucky on the tables tonight as you are in love, then I am sure you'll hit your jackpots.
Gentlemen, always a pleasure.
[ Laughing ]
- Blackjack!
- Wow!
Set aside enough for the "ali-money."
[ Laughing ]
Mimi, what are you doin' here?
-Just 'cause I booted you out doesn't mean I'm stuck at home.
-I want to come back.
I know I screwed up once.
Once.
But I was drunk off my ass.
I swear it didn't mean a damn thing.
Something I don't understand about men.
If it doesn't mean anything, why bother?
I promise I'll change.
Into what?
A frog?
Certainly not a prince.
How about the ass you already are?
What if I told you I wanted to fuck around tonight?
Sorry.
It would hurt like hell, wouldn't it?
Hey, maybe I already got even.
Maybe with one of your pals.
Maybe Chris.
He's cute.
Or how about Vincent?
The night you sent him over for that tragic heart-to-heart.
"Marty's really suffering, man.
Mimi, you've gotta talk to him."
[ Mimi Giggles ]
[ Woman ] Blackjack!
Oh!
Well, look at that, Tubs.
Your first-ever winning streak.
Just remember, dear heart...
half of it is mine.
[ Cheering, Applause ]
Whoo!
[ Cheering ]
I love you!
You gave Zoe a ticket for tonight?
Philip, let go.
I keep her away from bullshit like this, and then behind my back--
Christ, Phil, she's almost 20 years old.
What are you, her father?
Did you see her?
She looks like a whore.
I thought you like whores.
Yeah.
Let her have some fun.
I'm about to have some fun too.
I'm kind of on a roll.
Yeah?
Yeah, yeah.
I hope you win big-time.
You'll need it with all the shit you've been packin' up your nostrils.
So you noticed a tiny fraction of your stash went missing?
If you don't like it, file for a divorce.
I haven't ruled that out.
Don't forget about our prenup, loser.
[ Scoffs ]
Go play some blackjack.
Could be your last best chance at paying the rent.
Can I get some dice over here?
[ Cheering, Applause ]
Hands off.
Excuse me.
[ Cheering Continues ]
[ Beeps ]
[ Beeping ]
Anne?
Anne?
We need to talk.
Yeah?
About what?
Your pal the architect.
He's playing with fire.
[ Toilet Flushes ]
I'd actually rather talk about Anne.
[ Clears Throat ]
I'll pass along your message to Vincent, but I'd like something too, Mr. Kotkin.
I'd like for you to stop seeing Anne.
And why would I do that?
Because I love her.
Then we have more in common than we thought.
I'd like you to stop paying her.
I want you to let her go.
That's really not up to me.
Fact is, it's totally her choice.
Except I never paid for her.
Well, that's true.
You never paid.
Stop it, Joel.
I'm going.
What did he mean by that-- "You never paid"?
I don't want to love you, Chris.
Someone's paying you to be with me?
- You're the only one who can hurt me.
- Anne?
Tell me it's a lie.
The first time, it was paid for.
Every other time, that was real, that was me.
But who paid?
I can't--
Excuse me.
Come on, Zoe, let's go.
I'm fine here.
I'm asking you to come with me.
And I'm asking you to stop.
- Did you not hear the lady?
- Mind your business.
- Stop!
- Are you deaf or just a dick?
Huh?
I don't know, man.
What does it say up here?
"Deaf" or "dick"?
Help me out.
Huh?
- [ Shouting, Screaming ]
- Stop!
Stop!
Leave him alone!
Fuck!
- Come on!
- You filthy piece of shit!
- Excuse me.
- You're just like Dad!
- You are just like him!
- Somebody get this guy an ambulance.
I never want to see you again.
Not in my home and not near my daughter.
Do you got that?
Get him the hell out of here.
Okay, folks!
Let's get back to the gaming tables, shall we?
[ Sobbing ]
Hey.
It's okay.
I'm sorry.
Hey, it's okay.
It's not what you're thinking.
And what am I thinking?
She's my friend's sister.
Okay?
Are there more besides me, her and your wife?
What's the grand total?
Look, I can't have this conversation here.
Barbara's standing right over there.
Do you love me?
Of course I love you.
I'm crazy about you.
But would you choose me if you could?
You know it's not that simple.
Come meet me in the loft tomorrow, okay, and we'll talk it through.
You're right.
It's not that simple.
But maybe I can make it simple.
What do you mean?
Maybe I can help you make that choice.
Sarah.
Sarah.
Sarah.
Sarah.
I'm sorry.
Are you all right?
Don't do it, Sarah.
You'll regret it.
They found out.
[ Vincent's Voice Murmuring, Overlapping ]
Our wives, they-- they set us up.
Why, Vincent?
They--
They found out.
They found out about the loft.
Why would you do it, Vincent?
We're your friends.
[ Groans ]
- [ Vincent ] No.
- Why did you do it?
[ Groans ] No.
It was... our wives.
They-
- They found out.
No, it's your friends.
We found out.
- What's going on?
- You still don't get it.
[ Groaning ]
All right, strip him.
What are you doing?
- You are a total fucking psychopath.
- I did what you told me.
I didn't tell you to fucking cut her open!
That wasn't a part of the plan.
And the Latin on the bed?
Like the cops are gonna believe that bullshit.
- Then you should've done it yourself.
- Come on.
Let's do this.
What'd you give me?
What you deserve.
[ Echoing ]
You--
You killed Sarah?
No.
We just found her.
What?
We were here this morning, Vincent, before you arrived.
[ Sighs ] No.
[ Marty ] Jesus Christ.
[ Luke ] At first I thought she was sleeping.
[ Chris ] And Vincent knows her?
She-- She left him this.
"See you in the next life."
Why did she have to do it here?
We gotta call the cops.
They investigate suicides.
This is all gonna come out.
Guys, wait.
Can't we find out where she lives and-- and leave her there?
[ Luke ] Jesus.
Philip.
We have to help out Vince.
Speaking of which, where the fuck is Vince?
Isn't this his problem?
Hmm.
Vincent isn't here because, uh-- because I didn't call him.
You didn't call him?
Why didn't you call him?
There's something I have to show you.
You've been taping us?
You fucking pervert!
You can beat the crap out of me later.
We don't have much time, and you need to watch this.
Maybe you'll get a new perspective on what happened upstairs.
Maybe you'll agree we shouldn't take the hit for Vincent's fuckup.
You see, Vincent--
Vincent hasn't always been a good friend.
[ Woman Moaning ]
No.
Oh, God!
Hey, maybe I already got even.
Or maybe Vincent, the night you sent him over for that tragic heart-to-heart.
They got here late, the night he went to talk to her.
[ Moaning Continues ]
She was drunk, Marty.
He took advantage.
[ Giggling ]
Wow.
Your little sister's seriously hot.
Hey.
How long has it been--
Doesn't matter.
- How long?
- [ Moaning ]
He started seeing her right after your wedding.
They met here on a regular basis.
If I'm not mistaken, he was her first.
Fuck!
Gorgeous, huh?
The people you love, they're the only ones who can hurt you.
He paid Anne... to let you seduce her, put the hook in so you'd want a share of the loft.
The first time, it was paid for.
- Have fun.
- Chris, please.
You don't know the half of it.
All right?
Just go home.
[ Luke ] He used her, Chris.
Just like he used everyone.
Everyone.
[ Laughing, Chattering, Muffled ]
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.
Vincent can't sense anything is up when he walks in.
We have to try and remain calm.
We're gonna get questioned by the cops.
That's why we can never admit we're sharing this loft.
They'll try to turn us against each other.
Okay.
I think this can work as long as we follow the plan.
Chris?
Okay.
I'm in.
But only if we know for sure that Vincent was here last night.
I wanna hear him say it.
And if he does, I'll go through with it.
I'll give a signal-- uh, break something, a glass.
But nothing happens until we know for sure.
Understood?
We've got just under two hours to set everything up and establish alibis.
I'll take care of it.
You guys get out of here.
Make sure people see you.
- Uh, you have the suicide note, right?
- I've got it.
You knew what that prick was up to... and you never said anything.
You're just as sick as Vincent.
[ Door Opens ]
[ Door Closes ]
[ Luke ] They met here on a regular basis.
[ Whimpering ]
[ Luke ] Vincent hasn't always been a good friend.
[ Snorting ]
[ Luke ] He started seeing her right after your wedding.
[ Gasping ]
[ Luke ] If I'm not mistaken, he was her first.
[ Philip Shouts, Gasps ]
[ Gasping, Sobbing ]
[ Luke ] You are a total fucking psychopath.
I did what you told me.
I didn't tell you to fucking cut her open!
[ Marty ] That wasn't a part of the plan.
And the Latin on the bed?
Like the cops are gonna believe that bullshit.
What happened here?
You're framing me!
[ Gagging ]
[ Groaning, Coughing ]
- Swallow it.
Swallow.
Swallow.
- [ Coughing ]
[ Vincent Groaning ] My own friends.
My own friends!
Am I gonna die?
No, Vincent, you're not gonna die.
Sarah lured you here and drugged you.
Then she killed herself, with you by her side.
"Fate will unite us."
But you're gonna survive.
'Cause we're friends, aren't we?
[ Vincent ] So, you see, it was a setup.
Sarah and I were set up.
The whole thing was staged.
Still sounds a little unbelievable.
Don't you think?
Unbelievable?
But it's the truth.
Yeah.
My line of work, you gotta prove the truth, and you prove it with facts and findings.
Fact is, we only found your prints and those of Sarah Deakins.
Yeah, because they wiped the place clean.
And we have the DVDs of all your sexual exploits with your prints all over them.
Luke made those DVDs.
I never even saw 'em, let alone touched 'em.
Yeah, but we got no DVDs of your friends.
No DVDs of Marty's wife.
No DVDs of Philip's sister.
No DVDs of Chris's girlfriend.
All right?
Facts and findings, Mr. Stevens.
And we got no evidence that you were being set up.
All right.
Is there anything we've forgotten?
Yeah.
To follow the fuckin' plan.
Why didn't you just handcuff her?
- She was already dead.
- That's still no reason to mutilate her.
She killed herself!
I just made it more dramatic.
Well, you better hope your dramatics don't put us in jail.
Look, just-- just lean on 'em a little bit.
Marty will break.
Maybe Luke too.
Look, don't tell me how to do my work.
We've questioned them all.
I got no reason to believe they've been lying.
Plus, all your friends have alibis.
Alibis?
Not for this morning, they don't.
[ Male Detective ] We got Luke Seacord and Chris Vanowen together at breakfast.
We got Marty Landry at his office.
[ Vincent ] At his office?
Look, for at least an hour this morning, we were all in the loft.
So was Phil.
What about Phil?
He's downstairs right now with his father-in-law.
Fry?
What the fuck's Fry doing here?
He just gave a statement saying that he was with his son-in-law all day.
That is bullshit!
That is a false statement!
And why would he lie?
Hiram Fry brings a lot of credibility.
Credibili--
I saw Fry in San Diego with some bimbo!
Okay?
Phil knew that.
He knew I pressured Fry into giving me a waterfront contract.
So you tried to blackmail Hiram Fry?
[ Male Detective ] Mr. Stevens, enough of this crap.
We got your prints all over the DVDs.
We got 'em all over the knife.
We got you chained next to the dead girl on the bed.
Call your lawyer, make a confession and save your ass!
You're free to go.
I want to thank you for your cooperation.
You understand we had to check out your friend's story.
Of course.
It's your job.
There's just... one thing that's bothering me.
Why does Vincent Stevens keep accusing his best friends?
I-
- I don't know.
It bothers me too.
Hmm.
Could it be-
- I just-- I just wonder--
Do you think he's trying to hide something else?
Wh-What would he be hiding?
Sarah Deakins's murder.
Murder?
But the detective in the interrogation called it a suicide.
Well, that's what it looked like.
But the autopsy report revealed that sleeping pills didn't kill her.
And her wrist was cut, but not by Sarah.
Hesitation marks, those tentative attempts-- the first ones before a suicide actually slashes through an artery--
The coroner didn't find those on her.
But Vincent, he-- he would never--
His prints are on the knife.
We didn't find a suicide note.
Is there something wrong?
[ Female Detective ] We didn't find a suicide note.
[ Luke ] You have the suicide note, right?
[ Chris ] I've got it.
[ Chris ] Luke.
[ Chuckles ] Chris.
You scared me.
You sure it's smart meeting here?
I think we have a problem, Luke.
How so?
Where's Sarah's suicide note?
You put it in your pocket.
Yeah, I could've sworn I did, but it's not there anymore.
So when did you steal it from my coat?
When the doorbell rang this morning?
Surprise visit from the Realtor?
Chris, it's-- it's unfortunate that you lost Sarah's suicide note, but...
I had nothing to do with that.
I called the agency to ask who put our loft up for sale.
All they could give me was a number.
[ Phone Beeping ]
[ Phone Ringing ]
[ Ringing Continues ]
[ Phone Beeps, Stops Ringing ]
I did call them.
I wanted--
I thought maybe that--
[ Laughs ]
It's over, Chris.
We pulled it off.
We've got nothing to worry about now.
But why'd that note disappear?
The only real proof of her suicide.
[ Buzzing ]
[ Chris ] Hello?
She says she's got an appointment with someone named Sarah Deakins.
[ Marty ] Who's Sarah Deakins?
Is it because maybe she didn't write it?
Maybe it's your handwriting.
Vincent fucked us all.
You saw.
Yeah, I saw.
All the DVDs that made everybody crazy... went right along with your grand plan, didn't it?
But why, Luke?
What'd you do to that girl?
Did she get in your way, between you and Vincent?
Actually, it was Vincent... standing between us.
Is there someone else?
[ Luke ] I'm not cheating on you, Ellie.
Sarah, wait!
Forget Vincent.
He is better at games than you.
Always was, always will be.
He's hurting you.
Using you.
Why are you telling me this?
I'm telling you because-- because I'd never hurt you.
If you'd just give me the chance... to show I'd never hurt you.
That's right.
You'd never hurt me, because I feel nothing for you, Luke.
I'm sorry.
Maybe in another life.
You were here last night.
Barbara was off skiing.
So I figured I'd find Vincent here, with Sarah.
I'm sorry.
[ Crying ]
[ Luke ] I waited till he left.
[ Luke ] She said I was right about Vincent.
Consoling.
I've gotten so good at it.
I gave her an insulin OD.
It's quick, painless... leaves no trace.
Jesus, Luke.
[ Luke ] I did it out of love.
I swear.
And Vincent taking the fall for this--
That's okay with you?
Vincent used everyone and anyone!
It's about time we turned the tables!
Well, he's being charged with murder.
Yeah.
Sarah wasn't dead when we left her with Philip.
No.
No, you're lying.
No.
That's not possible.
[ Gasps ]
[ Philip Shouts ]
What Philip did to her... was sick!
You're sick, Luke.
But if I'm hearing you right, it was your brother who killed Sarah.
Okay, Chris.
Go home.
I'll clean up.
Like always.
No.
No more cleaning up, Luke.
- Step outside.
- No, Luke.
Now.
Jesus.
Let me help you, Luke.
Please!
- You're gonna kill me too?
- It's your own fault.
- What do you want me to do?
Jump?
- Yes.
If you don't mind.
Luke, you don't need to do this.
Jesus Christ, Luke!
Would you stop it!
I don't want to hurt you, Chris.
I really don't.
So just do it.
Now!
[ Sirens Wailing ]
I called the cops before I came.
I told 'em everything.
Bullshit.
I know you better.
- I thought I knew you.
- [ Grunts ]
What about the note?
Huh?
You want this to go down with me too?
Give me that note, Chris.
- Give it to me!
- [ Grunting ]
It's over, Luke.
You're right.
It is over.
Tell Ellie and the kids...
I'm sorry.
Would you do that for me, Chris?
- No.
- Come on, Chris.
- Be a friend.
- Luke?
Luke.
Luke!
Luke!

[ Marty ] They're married.
[ Mimi ] Honey, no.
They're having an affair.
[ Marty ] Why?
Because she's laughing at his jokes?
[ Mimi ] No.
I'm telling you, they're having an affair.
Since when are you the big expert on affairs?
Really?
Thanks for taking me back, Meems.
What was my alternative?
To leave you wailing at the front door, with snot pouring out of your nose?
Mmm.
Sorry.
Didn't mean to scare you off.
I have the kids early tomorrow, so I gotta go.
You're gonna leave me alone with my wife?
Yes.
We could at least have one more drink.
There'll be plenty more drinks.
Good night, Meems.
Good night, Chris.
[ Car Alarm Chirps ]
[ Anne ] Chris.
Anne.
Hi.
Hi.
[ Anne Chuckles ]
You look good.
Thank you.
You too.
Listen, I still have the key.
Do you want it back?
It wouldn't work anymore.
Vincent's living there alone now.
It's the only thing his wife let him keep.
And, uh-
- And Philip?
He's awaiting trial, so...
we'll see.
And you?
Are you doing okay?
Yeah.
Most of the time.
And the rest of the time?
I heard you ditched the city councilman.
That's not all I've given up.
Uh, do you wanna grab a cup of coffee, or--
SUBTITLES BY KOUSHIK DAS
I SWEAR TO GOD, I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.
WE WOULD LOVE TO BELIEVE YOU, MR. STEVENS, BUT YOU HAVE
TO ADMIT, YOUR VERSION OF EVENTS DOES SOUND PRETTY BIZARRE, DON'T YOU THINK?
LOOK, IT WAS A SETUP, OK?
THE WHOLE THING WAS STAGED.
SO YOU WERE AFRAID?
THAT'S YOUR CLAIM.
YOU WERE THE VICTIM?
WELL, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, NOT...
NOT LIKE...
NOT LIKE WHO?
NOT LIKE HER?
PLEASE, JUST TALK TO THE OTHERS GUYS.
HAVE YOU TALKED TO THE OTHERS THERE?
WE'RE DOING OUR JOBS.
SO, WHY DON'T YOU JUST DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND CONFESS?
YOU KNOW, SAVE SOME TIME, SAVE SOME LEGAL FEES.
COME ON.
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE US THROUGH THE EVENTS OF THIS MORNING?
AGAIN?
AGAIN, MR. STEVENS.
WHERE WERE YOU THIS MORNING, MR. STEVENS?
I WAS AT HOME.
ALONE.
MY WIFE'S TAKING THE KIDS SKIING.
YEAH, SURE, YOUR WIFE'S ON HER WAY BACK, AS WE SPEAK.
AND APPARENTLY, SHE HAS, UH, QUITE A FEW QUESTIONS, OF HER OWN.
SO, THE PHONE WOKE YOU AROUND WHAT TIME THIS MORNING?
I DON'T KNOW, UH, 9-9:30.
IT-IT WAS LUKE IN A PANIC.
HE SAID I HAD TO COME.
WHERE WERE YOU SUPPOSED TO GO?
TO THE LOFT.
HE TOLD ME TO COME TO THE LOFT.
DID HE SAY WHY HE WAS PANICKING?
NO.
WELL, DID YOU KNOW WHY HE WAS PANICKING?
NO, NOT YET.
LUKE.
LUKE?
OH, MY GOD!
OH, FUCK!
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU JUST...
WERE YOU...
I WALKED, IN SHE WAS...
LYING THERE...
OH, FUCK!
HAVE YOU CALLED THE OTHERS?
CHRIS AND MARTY ARE ON THEIR WAY.
I-I STILL HAVEN'T REACHED PHILIP.
OK, WELL, UH...
KEEP CALLING, WE NEED EVERYBODY HERE.
DO YOU KNOW WHO SHE IS?
VINCENT, DO YOU KNOW WHO'S LYING THERE?
WHAT?
NO, OF-OF COURSE NOT.
WELL, HOW THE FUCK DID THEY GET IN?
WHAT WAS IT, A W-WINDOW, A DOOR?
WINDOWS ARE SEALED AND THE DOOR WAS LOCKED.
THE ALARM WAS TURNED OFF.
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
I'M TELLING YOU, THE DOOR WAS LOCKED AND THE ALARM WAS TURNED OFF.
BUT THAT'D MEAN THAT...
THAT SOMEONE GOT IN...
WITH ONE OF OUR KEYS.
DO YOU KNOW THE LOFT BUILDING AT THE CORNER OF SECOND AND SOUTH HOPE, MR. SEACORD?
NO.
YOU KNOW, THE NEW RESIDENTIAL ONE, DOWN BY THE SPORTS ARENA?
DESIGNED, I BELIEVE, BY YOUR GOOD FRIEND, VINCENT STEVENS.
VINCENT RUNS A VERY LARGE FIRM.
HE'S DONE A LOT OF BUILDINGS.
THERE'S A LOFT ON THE NINTH FLOOR, MR. SEACORD.
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN THERE?
NO.
STRANGE, BECAUSE ACCORDING TO OUR INFORMATION, YOU AND FOUR FRIENDS ARE SHARING THIS LOFT
SECRETLY, WITHOUT YOUR WIVES' KNOWLEDGE.
THAT IS RIDICULOUS.
DON'T THE FIVE OF YOU BRING WOMEN UP THERE?
GIRLFRIENDS, MISTRESSES, ONE NIGHT STANDS, CATCH OF THE DAY?
FIVE PALS, JUST LOOKING FOR PRIVACY AND FUN,
WITHOUT THE HASSLE OF VISA STATEMENTS AND HOTEL BILLS, THE MRS. MIGHT FIND.
THAT IS PREPOSTEROUS.
MAYBE, MR. SEACORD, BUT ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS ALREADY MADE A FULL CONFESSION.
YOU WANNA KNOW WHO?
LISTEN...
I DON'T DO THINGS LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW, FOOL AROUND WITH OTHER WOMEN, I...
YOU LOVE YOUR WIFE.
I LOVE MY WIFE, YES.
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FACE, MR. SEACORD?
I WALKED INTO A DOOR.
OR WERE YOU IN A FIGHT?
I SAID I WALKED INTO A DOOR.
WHERE WERE YOU THIS MORNING?
OUT WITH CHRIS, HAVING BREAKFAST.
THERE'D BE A LOT OF PEOPLE AT THE RESTAURANT TO VERIFY THAT.
BY CHRIS, YOU MEAN DR. CHRIS VANOWEN, THE PSYCHIATRIST?
THAT'S RIGHT.
ONE OF YOUR LOFT BUDDIES?
CHRIS IS MARRIED.
HE'S GOT TWO KIDS AND, UH...
HE'S NOT A GUY THAT CHEATS ON HIS WIFE, EITHER.
I GOT A SERIOUS FUCKING PROBLEM, CHRIS.
OH, SHIT!
PHILIP.
PHILIP?
WHAT, YOU THINK YOUR BROTHER HAS SOMETHING TO DO THIS?
NO.
WE GOTTA CALL THE COPS.
YOU REALIZE WHAT'LL HAPPEN, IF WE CALL THE COPS?
THINK ABOUT OUR WIVES.
IT'S A DEAD WOMAN HERE, VINCENT.
WHY DO WE THINK PHILLIP IS INVOLVED?
LOOK, CHRIS, YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S CAPABLE OF.
YEAH, I KNOW.
MAYBE WE CAN HELP HIM, OK?
IF WE CAN JUST FIGURE OUT WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED, THEN MAYBE WE CAN...
THEN WHAT, WE GONNA DUMP THE BODY SOMEWHERE?
LOOK, I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, BUT I'M NOT TAKING THE FALL FOR THIS.
MARTY...
SON OF A BITCH!
HAVE YOU SEEN PHIL?
DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS?
WAS HE HERE LAST NIGHT?
THIS CAN'T BE REAL.
WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I WANNA SEE HER.
PUT HER BACK.
GODDAMMIT.
WHO IS SHE?
I DON'T KNOW.
LOOK.
NONE OF US HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS, RIGHT?
RIGHT?
WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE AND WE'LL FIGURE A WAY OUT.
WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER, WE'LL GET OUT OF IT TOGETHER, OK?
BECAUSE WE'RE FRIENDS.
AGREED?
AGREED?
WELL, LOOKS LIKE THEY'LL LET ANYBODY IN, RIGHT?
.
CONGRATULATIONS, VINCE.
THIS ONE'S REALLY SPECTACULAR.
VERY SPECIAL.
I APPRECIATE THAT.
ALLIE, ITS BEEN TOO LONG.
YOU LOOK TERRIFIC.
THANK YOU.
SO, UH...
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
WELL, IT'S BOLD AND FOCUSED, AS ALWAYS.
I LIKE IT.
HEY, YOU MADE IT.
HI.
HI.
HI!
HOW-HOW ARE YOU?
WANNA BUY YOUSELVES A LITTLE CONDO?
I THINK VINCENT'S LITTLE CONDOS ARE A LITTLE OUT OF OUR LEAGUE.
RIGHT, YOU AND YOUR PUNY PSYCHIATRIST SALARY.
HEY, YOU GUYS.
GRAB A DRINK, AND WE'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU LATER, ALRIGHT?
ALRIGHT, OK.
CONGRATS, BUDDY.
THANKS, MAN.
ONE HOUR, TOPS, THEN WE'RE OUT OF HERE.
OH, COME ON, HON.
WE JUST GOT HERE.
MAN, CHECK OUT ALL THESE BABES, SO HOT!
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE IN VIOLATION OF THE FUCKING FIRE CODE.
MARTY, CALM DOWN.
I'VE SEEN THEM.
I CAN ALSO SEE MIMI...
YOUR WIFE.
OK, SAVE ME...
HELP ME...
PROTECT ME.
WHAT'S UP, CHUBBS?
HAVIN' TOO MUCH FUN?
NOPE, JUST, UH, CHECKIN' OUT THE HIPSTER CROWD WITH MY PAL, LUKE.
MMM-HMM!
YEAH, IF YOU EMBARRASS ME, YOU MAY BE HERE ALL BY YOURSELF.
OH, DON'T RAISE MY HOPES ONLY TO DASH THEM.
HI, LUKE.
WHERE'S ALLIE?
UH, SHE'S JUST FEELING DIZZY.
DUCKED OUT TO CHECK HER BLOOD SUGAR.
HI, ALLIE.
YOU FEEL OK?
OH, I, UM...
STARTED TO FEEL NOT SO GREAT, BEFORE, BUT...
I'M BETTER NOW.
WE CAN ALWAYS GO HOME, SWEETIE.
DID YOU HEAR THAT, SWEETIE?
AFTER SHE JUST CHECKED HER BLOOD SUGAR.
THAT'S FUNNY.
THAT'S REALLY GOOD.
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU DEAL WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT, IF IT WAS ME.
OH, YOU KNOW, BABY, I'D LOVE TO STICK YOU IN THE ASS, EVERY DAY.
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I ASKED?
HONEY.
WHAT?
NOT NOW.
YOU'RE THE SHRINK, AREN'T YOU?
UH, YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
CHRIS VANOWEN.
AH!
DR. VANOWEN!
THAT'S RIGHT.
YES, I REMEMBER.
DO WE KNOW EACH OTHER?
UH, NO...
UH, YOU KNEW MY SISTER.
SHE WAS A-A PATIENT OF YOURS, ACTUALLY.

NO.
I'M SORRY.
I'M-I'M REALLY SORRY.

BORN UNHAPPY.
I'M SORRY, ARE YOU BUYING AN APARTMENT?
WHAT?
UMM, NO...
NO-NO, I'M FRIENDS WITH THE ARCHITECT.
OH!
ARE YOU?
NO, NO, I'M HERE WITH, UH, JOEL KOTKIN.

UNFORTUNATELY, SO...
WELL, YOU'RE NOT THINKING OF DOING SOMETHING STUPID, ARE YOU, ANNE?

AND, UH, THIS ONE...
WORKS WITH ME, DOWN AT THE OFFICE.
OR IS IT OTHER WAY AROUND?

AW, COME ON, MAN.
I'M S-SELLING, YOU KNOW?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT?
IT'S NOT LIKE I DON'T LOVE MY LITTLE VICKY, MAN.
I LOVE HER MADLY!
YOU KNOW THAT.
ALRIGHT?
IT'S NOT LIKE I HATE ALL THE OTHER WOMEN IN THE WORLD, MAN.
RIGHT.
ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT, RELAX.
THERE'S SOMETHING I WANNA SHOW YOU.
LET'S GO GET MARTY AND LUKE.
CHRIS?
GENTLEMEN!
WELCOME TO THE LOFT.
WOW, THIS IS IMPRESSIVE, VINCE!
CHECK OUT THE VIEW.
THEN, IMAGINE THAT THIS IS OUR OWN PRIVATE OASIS, RIGHT IN THE HEART DOWNTOWN.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
A PLACE WHERE NO ONE HASSLES YOU.
A PLACE YOU CAN ESCAPE TO, ANY TIME YOU WANT.
OK, SO, THIS YOUR LOFT?
NO, IT'S OURS...
IF YOU WANT IT.
WHAT?
OURS?
THINK ABOUT IT.
NO MESSY HOTEL BILLS, NO...
QUESTIONABLE CREDIT CARD ACTIVITY.
THIS WOULD BE OUR SECRET PLACE.
TO STEAL AWAY,
DISCREETLY AND ECONOMICALLY, IN THESE...
CHALLENGING TIMES.
FIVE WAY SPLIT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M NOT LIKE THAT.
COME ON, CHRIS.
WE'RE MEN.
WE'RE ALL A LITTLE LIKE THAT.
YEAH, TELL ME ABOUT IT.
GIVE ME YOUR KEY RIGHT NOW, BRING YOUR TWINS UP HERE,
GIVE 'EM A LITTLE PRIVATE TOUR.
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY COST, MARTY?
HOW MUCH?
I MIGHT HAVE IT ON ME, RIGHT NOW.
SERIOUSLY.
THINK ABOUT IT.
IT'S A GREAT INVESTMENT.
A ONCE IN A LIFETIME GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY.
I CAN'T STAY HERE.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
LUKE?
YOU CANNOT FREAK OUT, RIGHT NOW.
WE HAVE TO STAY TOGETHER, LIKE WE SAID.
ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT.
LUKE, YOU JUST CALM THE FUCK DOWN.
NO, NO!
IT'S OVER, VINCENT.
IT'S ALL GONNA COME OUT!
IT'S NOT OVER.
LISTEN!
WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE AND WE GONNA FIX IT.
OK?
TRY PHIL AGAIN.
THIS IS PHILIP.
PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE AFTER THE TONE.
WHAT IF HE DOESN'T SHOW?
WE NEED TO BE OUT OF THE COUNTRY BY...
HE'LL SHOW.
YOU CAN'T COVER HIM, CHRIS.
NOT THIS TIME.
GUYS, LOOK AT THIS.
WHAT'S IT MEAN?
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
DO YOU KNOW LATIN, DOCTOR?
EXCUSE ME?
LATIN, DO YOU KNOW LATIN?
I TOOK IT PRE-MED, YEAH.
WHAT'S IT SAY ON THE WALL, THERE?
FATUM NOS IUNGEBIT.
FATUM NOS IUNGEBIT?
I CAN READ THAT.
WHAT'S IT MEAN?
I'M GUESSING YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.
NO, WE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR YOU SAY IT.
YOU'D LIKE TO HEAR ME SAY IT?
OK.
FATUM NOS IUNGEBIT, UH...
FATE WILL UNITE US.
NOW, ALL I CAN POSSIBLY THINK, IS THAT SOMEBODY, WHO KNOWS LATIN, LIKE YOU...
REACHED OVER, WITH THIS YOUNG LADY'S HAND, AND WROTE FATUM NOS IUNGEBIT ON THE WALL.
FATUM NOS IUNGEBIT IS WRONG.
HOW SO, DOCTOR?
THE FUTURE IMPERFECT TENSE.
THE VERB, UNITE, IUNGERE IS NOT IUNGEBIT.
IT'S IUNGET.
IT SHOULD SAY FATUM NOS IUNGET.
SO, THE PERSON YOU'RE LOOKING FOR, MADE A CLASSIC LATIN ERROR.
I'M GUESSING YOU KNEW THAT ALREADY, TOO.
DIDN'T YOU?
KNOW THE PHRASE, "FUCK YOU"?
GERMANIC ORIGIN.
WHERE'S YOUR BROTHER?
I'M SORRY, I CAN'T HELP YOU WITH THAT ONE.
RIGHT.
WELL, ACTUALLY, HE'S YOUR HALF BROTHER, ISN'T HE?
SAME MOTHER, DIFFERENT FATHERS?
HE SPENT SOME TIME IN VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS, WITH YOUR HALF-SISTER, ZOE.
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
AFTER OUR MOTHER DIED, UM...
PHILIP WASN'T...
WASN'T AS LUCKY WITH HIS FATHER.
APPARENTLY, NOT.
ALCOHOLIC CHILD BEATER.
MMM.
YOU DIDN'T SPEND MUCH TIME WITH PHILIP BACK THEN, DID YOU?
NO.
BUT NOW, YOU'RE BEST FRIENDS?
WELL, WE'VE HAD A LOT OF CATCHING UP TO DO.
YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW WHERE WE CAN FIND HIM?
FATE WILL UNITE US?
WHERE THE HELL'S YOUR BROTHER, CHRIS?
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?
WHERE THE FUCK IS PHILIP?
I'M RIGHT HERE.
NOW, WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?
YOU DID THIS.
YOU DID THIS!
LUKE, LUKE, LUKE!
LUKE!
COME HERE, HEY, HEY!
HANDS OFF ME!
BRING IT ON!
WHAT IS THIS?
LUKE!
DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!
JUST ANSWER THE FUCKING QUESTION!
DID YOU DO THIS?
OF COURSE NOT!
JESUS CHRIST!
WERE YOU HERE LAST NIGHT?
NO, MAN.
I WASN'T HERE LAST NIGHT.
I SLEPT AT MY IN-LAWS.
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, CALL VICKY.
WHAT ABOUT THIS MORNING.
WERE YOU HERE THIS MORNING?
I WAS AT A PROJECT SITE, ALRIGHT?
WITH MY FATHER-IN-LAW.
MY GOD!
WHERE WERE YOU LAST NIGHT?
WHERE'VE YOU BEEN?
PHILIP, TAKE IT EASY.
BEFORE ACCUSING EVERYONE ELSE, WHERE'VE YOU BEEN?
'CAUSE I'VE
NEVER GOT A TEXT THAT'S SAYIN' THE LOFT WAS TAKEN.
NEVER..
LAST NIGHT, I WAS AT HOME.
CAN YOU PROVE IT?
NO, I CAN'T PROVE IT, BECAUSE BARBARA'S TAKEN THE KID SKIING.
YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE MY WORD FOR IT!
ALRIGHT, GUYS!
COME ON, COME ON!
YOUR WORD?
!
THERE'S A DEAD WOMAN IN OUR LOFT...
THAT ONLY US HAVE ACCESS TO.
NOW, IF ANYBODY HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS, NOW'S THE TIME TO SAY IT, RIGHT NOW.
THANK YOU, VERY MUCH.
WELL, PHILIP'S GOT A BALL AND CHAIN, NOW.
WHO WOULDA THUNK IT?
WHO'S THE FATHER-IN-LAW, AGAIN?
HIS NAME'S HIRAM FRY.
HE'S A...
HUGE PROPERTY DEVELOPER.
HIS FRIENDS CALL HIM, "THE MAN OF STEEL".
HE'S WORTH MILLIONS.
VICKY'S HIS ONLY DAUGHTER.
SO, WHAT'S NOT TO LOVE?
I JUST HOPE PHILIP WILL BE HAPPY.
WELL, THAT'S COZY.
COME ON.
EVER SINCE COUNCILMAN KOTKIN GOT ELECTED, MAN OF STEEL'S BEEN BUSY REBUILDING DOWNTOWN.
KOTKIN CAME TO YOUR OPENING, RIGHT?
YEAH, HE TURNED UP FOR A PHOTO-OP.
WHEN IT COMES TO HANDING OUT PERMITS AND CONTRACTS, THOUGH...
GAME'S RIGGED.
WAIT A MINUTE.
TELL ME WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, AGAIN?
'CAUSE I JUST SAW SOME MINI CHEESECAKES.
GORGEOUS, HUH?
I MEAN THIS...
WHOLE SETUP.
WHOEVER SAID MONEY CAN'T BUY HAPPINESS, SURE HASN'T LIVED THIS LIFE.
SORRY BOYS, YOU LOST YOUR BACHELOR MASCOT.
HE'S ALL MINE, NOW.
GOOD LUCK WITH BREAKING THIS BRONCO, VICKY.
GOD KNOWS, OTHERS HAVE TRIED.
BUT I'M NOT OTHERS, AM I, PHILIP?
HO, HO!
TOLD YOU!
AND IT'S NOT JUST ME.
PHILIP'S MARRIED INTO THE FRY FAMILY, NOW.
AS SOON AS WE'RE BACK FROM FIJI...
YEAH,
WELL, I'M GONNA SELL SOME PROPERTIES WITH VICKY'S DAD.
YOU KNOW, SEE HOW IT GRABS ME.
WOW!
GRABS YOU.
WELL, GUYS, THANKS FOR COMING.
CONGRATULATIONS.
I'LL BE WITH YOU IN A SECOND, BABY.
OH, MAN!
I NEED A BREAK FROM ALL THE ASS KISSING, MAN.
WHERE IS FIJI?
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
PHIL.
YOUR WEDDING PRESENT.
ARE YOU FOR REAL?
ABSOLUTELY!
DON'T LOSE IT.
THERE'S ONLY FIVE OF THESE IN EXISTENCE.
ACCEPTING A KEY TO THE LOFT, MEANS YOU ACCEPT RULES TO THE LOFT.
MARTY?
WHAT ARE YOU, CRAZY?
OUR WIVES ARE HERE.
DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S A BIT CYNICAL, HANDING THOSE THINGS OUT HERE?
CYNICAL?
IT'S JUST A KEY TO A ROOM.
YOU SHOULD CHECK IT OUT.
OH, NO, YOU'RE NOT LIKE THAT.
NOT NOW, MAYBE LATER.
WHAT ABOUT YOU, LUKE?
NOW, OR LATER?
COME ON.
ATTABOY!
WELL, YOU JUST MAKE SURE THIS DOESN'T BLOW UP IN YOUR FACES.
HOW'S IT GONNA BLOW UP IN OUR FACE?
IT'S JUST A ROOM.
LIKE VINCE SAID.
OUR ROOM.
NOW, WE KEEP IT TO OURSELVES, ALRIGHT?
TELL NOBODY.
JUST STAYS WITHIN OUR CIRCLE.
MARTY?
YEAH?
YEAH!
NOW YOU JUST NEED TO FIND SOMEONE WILLING TO GO WITH YOU, MARTY.
OH, YEAH?
YEAH, I THINK THERE'S, UH, PLENTY OF CHOICES, RIGHT HERE.
SOME OF THESE GUYS BRING SOME
PREMIUM GRADE, HIGH TEST PUSSY.
LIKE THAT LITTLE, DEWY-EYED VIXEN, RIGHT THERE.
SHE LOOKS UNDERAGE.
UH, SHE'S TWENTY.
IF ONE OF YOU MESSES WITH HER, I'M GONNA CRACK YOUR HEAD WIDE OPEN!
OH, WHAT, HAVE YOU GOT DIBS ON MISS CURLY LOCKS?
LISTEN, MAN.
THAT'S ZOE, ALRIGHT?
ZOE?
YEAH.
LIKE, AS IN SKIN AND BONES, TOMBOY, ZOE?
YEAH.
I HATE TO SAY IT, PHIL, BUT YOUR LITTLE SISTER IS SERIOUSLY HOT.
THANKS MAN.
SHE'S NOT LITTLE ANY MORE.
THAT IS THE FINEST PIECE OF ASS...
YO, MARTY, IT'S ENOUGH.
I'M JUST SAYING...
I WANT TO FUCK HER LIKE AN ANIMAL, YOU KNOW...
COME ON, MARTY, IT'S ENOUGH.
FEEL IT FROM THE INSIDE?
I WANNA FUCK YOU LIKE AN ANIMAL.
YOU'RE NOT SAYING ANOTHER WORD.
YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT MY SISTER, GOT IT?
YOU GOT IT?
FUCK!
YOU WATCH IT!
YOU WATCH IT.
KICK YOUR ASS AT YOUR OWN FUCKING WEDDING.
HI.
HI.
WE MET AT THE, UH, THE BUILDING OPENING.
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU'RE...
ANNE MORRIS.
I'M GLAD YOU REMEMBER ME, CHRIS.
MMM.
I SEE YOU WORK WEEKENDS.
WHAT A DEDICATED PERSONAL ASSISTANT.
WHAT A LUCKY CITY COUNCILMAN.
HAH!
SCREW HIM.
DO YOU?
DOES IT GET A BIT BORING, WALKING AROUND ALL THESE PARTIES BY YOURSELF?
HE WANTS YOU CLOSE, BUT NOT TOO CLOSE.
NOT WHEN THERE'S IMPORTANT PEOPLE AROUND.
I TOLD YOU.
I FALL FOR THE WRONG MEN.
CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET?
OUR CITY COUNCILMAN LIKES TO KEEP MY PANTIES WITH HIM, AT THESE EVENTS, IN HIS POCKET.
IT'S A TURN-ON FOR HIM.
THE THOUGHT OF ME IN A CROWD, SO NAKED...
ONLY HE KNOWS.
WHY DO YOU LET HIM USE YOU LIKE THAT?
WHO SAYS HE'S USING ME?
MAYBE...
IT TURNS ME ON.
MAYBE, ME TELLING YOU ABOUT IT, TURNS ME ON, EVEN MORE...
I HOPE YOU DON'T CATCH COLD.
CHRIS.
CHRIS, I'M SORRY.
I-I...
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE I-I WAS TESTING YOU.
I DON'T NEED TO BE TESTED.
LISTEN, DO YOU WANT...
MAYBE GET A CUP OF COFFEE...
SOMEPLACE QUIET...
PRIVATE?
I'D LIKE TO USE YOUR KEY.
JUST ONCE.
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.
HEY, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I THINK.
HAVE FUN.
DOES EVERYONE STILL HAVE A KEY?
OF COURSE WE DO.
IT'S CRUCIAL WE GET THIS RIGHT.
FIVE KEYS WERE CUT.
TO MAKE A SIXTH, YOU'D NEED THE CODE, WHICH IS IN MY SAFE.
SO, WE CAN RULE THAT OUT.
BUT THERE WAS NO BREAK-IN, SO DOES EVERYONE STILL HAVE A KEY?
WHAT, YOU THINK WE'VE BEEN GIVING AWAY OUR KEYS?
IT'S AGAINST YOUR RULES, VINCE.
THEN, SHOW ME.
WELL, WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO PROVE HERE?
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE SOMEONE'S LOST A KEY.
OK?
LET-LET'S JUST RULE THAT OUT.
OK?
LOOK.
HERE'S MINE.
ALRIGHT?
CHRIS?
YOU DIDN'T USE A KEY TO GET IN, JUST THEN.
NO.
I DIDN'T BRING IT.
WHERE IS IT?
I DON'T HAVE IT ON ME, OK?
IT'S NOT LIKE I NEED IT EVERY DAY, LIKE SOME OF YOU GUYS.
BUT YOU DO STILL HAVE IT?
VINCENT,
WHETHER OR NOT I HAVE MY KEY ON ME, RIGHT NOW, IS REALLY NOT IMPORTANT.
IT'S EXTREMELY FUCKING IMPORTANT.
SOMEONE GOT IN USING A KEY AND YOURS IS MISSING.
IS THAT RIGHT VINCENT?
THEN HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT THE ALARM WAS SHUT OFF?
SO, LET'S JUST CUT THE BULLSHIT, 'CAUSE IT DEFINITELY HAD TO BE ONE OF US FIVE.
UNLESS...
UNLESS WHAT?
UNLESS SHE LET HIM IN.
OH, YEAH?
THEN HOW'D SHE GET IN, VINCENT?
ANY WAY YOU LOOK AT IT, IT KEEPS COMING BACK DOWN TO US,
AND I, FOR ONE, WOULD LIKE TO KNOW, WHO'S HIDING SOMETHING?
IS THERE A WORD FOR THAT?
YES, POLYAMORY.
IT'S A...
PHILOSOPHY, SOME SORT OF BELIEF SYSTEM ABOUT BEING ROMANTICALLY
INVOLVED WITH MORE THAN ONE PERSON, AT THE SAME TIME.
UH, HUH.
AND YOUR BOSS GET AWAY WITH THAT?
YES, HE SAYS THAT HE'S IN LOVE WITH HIS WIFE AND HIS GIRLFRIEND, SO WHY SHOULD HE HAVE TO CHOOSE?
UH, HUH.
AND HIS WIFE IS AMAZINGLY COOL WITH IT.
OH, REALLY?
IS SHE SPECIAL NEEDS?
MAYBE OXYGEN DEPRIVED?
WHAT?
EXPLAIN.
I'D LIKE TO KNOW.
IT SOUNDS LIKE MY KIND OF PHILOSOPHY, BARBARA.
WHAT'S IT CALLED AGAIN?
POLYANNEMARIE?
PLEASE, SPARE US, CHUBBS.
YOU CAN BARELY HANDLE ONE WOMAN.
WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH TWO?
HMMM.
MARRY ONE.
I WOULD MAKE UP SOMETHING.
SOME SORT OF GAME THAT INVOLVES TWO LADIES AND ONE GUY.
START A TRAPEZE ACT, OR SOMETHING.
COULD YOU AT LEAST FAKE SOME ENTHUSIASM?
IT'S YOUR PARTY.
ANYWAY, I'M COOKING.
YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO INVITE YOUR FRIENDS OVER, COULD YOU AT LEAST TRY AND MAKE IT HOME IN TIME?
THEY'RE NEVER HERE, OK?
WILL YOU JUST JOIN US?
I JUST HOPE THE PUDGY CLOWN DOESN'T PUKE ON THE RUG.
HE'S BEEN CHUGGING VODKA LIKE IT'S EVIAN.
I MEAN, DOESN'T HIS WIFE SEE THAT?
ACTUALLY, SHE WAS JUST COOL WITH IT LONG ENOUGH TO CATCH HIM IN THE ACT.
SHE HIRED A DETECTIVE.
CELLPHONE RECORDS, CREDIT CARD RECEIPTS, AUDIO, VIDEO, THE WORKS.
AND, IN A HEARTBEAT, MY POOR BOSS WENT FROM POLYAMORY TO ALIMONY.
MAN, YOUR BOSS SOUNDS MENTALLY RETARDED.
SO, WHAT-WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?
OH, UH...
HE AND HIS CONCUBINE ARE NOW CRAMPED IN A TINY ONE BEDROOM CONDO...
BUT, I'M GUESSING HE'S HAPPY.
SHE'S BLONDE, 23, WITH A BRAND NEW PAIR OF FAKE BREASTS.
HOW CAN MEN STAND FAKE BREASTS?
WHY ARE WOMEN ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT FAKE TITS THIS, FAKE TITS THAT?
I MEAN, LISTEN, GIRLS, IF IT'S A DECENT BOOB JOB, WHO FUCKING CARES, YOU KNOW?
MY MOM...
MY MOM, SHE'S GOT, UH...
FALSE TEETH, OK?
WHEN SHE SMILES, DO PEOPLE GIVE HER SHIT AND SAY, "OH, MY GOD!
LOOK!
FAKE!"
NO, THEY DON'T, THEY SAY, "WOW!
YOU LOOK WAY BETTER, NOW.
IT'S AN IMPROVEMENT."
YOU KNOW, YOU WOMEN, YOU'RE SO CATTY, SO COMPETITIVE.
CALM DOWN, TUBBY, DEAREST...
NO, NO.
YOU KNOW WHAT, NO?
IT'S NOTHING-NOTHING TO CALM ABOUT, MIMI.
I MEAN, A GLORIOUS BIG SETUP, FUCKING TITS AND A NICE
PIECE OF ASS.
IT'S-IT'S-IT'S THRILLING.
IT'S THRILLING.
THIS IS ALL...
A LITTLE TOO HIGHBROW FOR MY TEENY, TINY, CATTY...
FEMALE MIND.
OH, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU SHOULD HAVE THAT ENLARGED.
HUH?
AND WHILE YOU'RE UNDER, YOU SHOULD HAVE THE CORNERS OF YOUR MOUTH LIFTED
SO YOU CAN SMILE EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE.
SORRY.
SORRY, CHRIS!
MARTY?
MARTY, COME ON!
WHAT?
WHAT?
NO.
NO, YOU'RE CLASS ACT, MARTY.
MIMI, WOULD YOU LIKE TO GET YOUR HUSBAND ANOTHER DRINK, OR SHOULD I, DO THE HONORS?
YOU SHOULD DO IT, AND I WANT IT CHILLED...
AND THEN YOU GO WITH HER AND STIR...
HONEY....
THE PROBLEM WITH YOUR BOSS, BARBARA, IS HE DIDN'T HAVE HIS SHIT TOGETHER.
I MEAN, APART, PART, I MEAN, HE DIDN'T, NO, I MEAN HE DIDN'T COMPARTMENTALIZE.
DO YOU GUYS AGREE?
ALRIGHT, MARTY.
HOW WOULD YOU COMPARTMENTALIZE?
HOW?
OK, WELL, SINCE YOU ASK.
FIRST THING FIRST IS, I WOULDN'T HAVE A PLACE THAT YOU COULD GET CAUGHT.
NOT A HOTEL, NOT YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S CRIB.
IT'S KEY, RIGHT?
AM I RIGHT?
VINNY, BOY.
AM I RIGHT?
MARTY, YOU'VE-YOU'VE LOST US ALL.
I DOUBT THAT.
I DOUBT THAT, VINNY BOY.
IT'S, OK.
FIRST OF ALL, SORRY, BABY, I WOULD JUST GET A LITTLE,
YOU KNOW, A LITTLE ONE BEDROOM CONDO, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
OH, YOU ALRIGHT?
MIMI, YOUR HUSBAND TENDS TO TALK OUT HIS ASS WHEN HE'S BEEN DRINKING, YEAH?
ALRIGHT, THERE WE GO.
HONEY, WOULD YOU GIVE ME A HAND?
SURE.
SORRY, DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE IN HERE.
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.
HEY, TOO MUCH, TOO FAST, I GUESS.
THAI FOOD, YOU KNOW.
YEAH, IT GETS ALL UP IN YOUR NOSE AND SHIT.
YEAH, IT'S A LITTLE SPICY.
YEAH.
I'M OUTTA HERE.
BOY.
I NEED TO PICK UP SOME MORE INSULIN.
LUKE...
IS THERE SOMETHING YOU WANNA TELL ME?
ARE YOU KEEPING SECRETS?
WHAT KIND OF SECRETS?
IS THERE SOMEONE ELSE?
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU START ASKING ME SILLY QUESTIONS, BUT THE ANSWER IS NO.
I'M NOT CHEATING ON YOU, HONEY.
IT'S NOT WHY I'M ASKING, LUKE.
I'M ASKING IF THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE.
LISTEN, SWEETIE.
WHATEVER I MAY BE, OR MAY NOT BE, AND...
I KNOW I'M NOT AS GLAMOROUS AS SOME.
BUT I'LL ALWAYS BE THERE FOR YOU...
AND THE CHILDREN.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO WITHOUT YOU.
I WANT YOU TO KNOW...
THERE'S A LOT I COULD PUT UP WITH...
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I NEED TO GET HER OUT OF HERE.
HOW?
SHE IS SHACKLED TO THE BED!
CAN'T YOU GUYS SEE WHAT'S GOING ON?
SOMEONE IS TRYING TO FRAME US.
WHO?
WHO WANTS TO FRAME US?
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT THINK ABOUT IT.
THE BODY'S CUFFED TO THE BED.
IT'S POSSIBLE TO MOVE.
THE LATIN.
THE KNIFE.
SOMEONE DID THIS FOR A REASON.
HELL, THE COPS COULD BE HERE ANY SECOND.
YEAH, BUT NONE OF US KNOW WHO THIS GIRL IS.
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW SHE GOT IN HERE.
WHO ELSE KNEW ABOUT THE ARRANGEMENT?
WHO ELSE KNOWS ABOUT OUR ARRANGEMENT?
DID ANYONE BLAB?
TELL ONE OF THE GIRLS THAT HAVE BEEN UP HERE?
MARTY?
WHAT?
WHY ME?
IT WAS SOME NIGHT YOU WERE HAMMERED, MAYBE.
I'VE ALWAYS FOLLOWED THE RULES, VINCENT.
DID YOU GIVE ANYONE YOUR CODE.
DID YOU-DID YOU KEY IN, WHILE SOMEONE WAS WATCHING?
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
I JUST TOLD YOU.
ALRIGHT, WAIT!
WHAT'S YOUR POINT, VINCENT?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING WITH THIS?
SOMEONE IS TRYING TO SET US UP.
LIKE WHO?
I DON'T KNOW.
A-A REJECTED GIRLFRIEND.
A JEALOUS BOYFRIEND, BETRAYED HUSBAND.
SOMEONE WITH A MOTIVE.
LOOK, IS ONE OF YOU GUYS IN SOME KIND OF TROUBLE?
I THINK I MAY BE FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOU.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY THAT.
NO, BUT, I MEAN IT.
WHY WOULD SAY THAT, CHRIS?
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN FEEL IT?
I'VE NEVER CHEATED ON MY WIFE BEFORE...
AND I DON'T FALL IN LOVE EASILY.
CHRIS, I DON'T WANT YOU TO LOVE ME.
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ME.
APART FROM THESE STOLEN MOMENTS...
THEY'RE EXCITING, YEAH, SURE, BUT...
THEY'RE JUST MOMENTS.
LET'S CHANGE THAT.
I WANNA SEE YOU MORE OFTEN.
CHRIS, PLEASE.
NOT JUST FOR THIS.
NO.
STOP IT.
I...
I DON'T WANT YOU TO LOVE ME.
WELL, I DON'T WANNA KEEP SNEAKING AROUND.
I'M GONNA TELL ALLISON ABOUT US.
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
YES, I AM.
ANNE!
I'M GONNA LEAVE HER.
STOP IT.
WHY YOU DOING THIS?
THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE...
THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN HURT YOU.
I WOULD NEVER HURT YOU, ANNE.
STOP.
STOP WHAT?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
WOULD YOU...
STOP IT, OK?
YOU DON'T KNOW ME, OK?
THAT'S THE END OF IT.
NO.
WELL, WOULD YOU GIVE ME A CHANCE, AT LEAST...
I'M A WHORE...
ALRIGHT?
WHAT?
I'M A PROSTITUTE.
I FUCK MEN FOR MONEY.
DO YOU GET IT NOW?
DON'T WORRY, DOCTOR, I WON'T BILL YOU FOR THE PAST
FEW MONTHS.
PLEASE, ANNE, WOULD YOU WAIT, WOULD YOU...
CHRIS...
WOULD YOU WAIT A MINUTE?
PLEASE STOP IT.
YOU DON'T KNOW HALF OF IT, ALRIGHT?
JUST GO HOME.
GO HOME TO YOUR WIFE AND YOUR KIDS.
IS YOUR FRIEND, CHRIS VANOWEN, CHEATING ON HIS WIFE, MR. LANDRY?
OH, I-I DOUBT THAT.
CHRIS IS A VERY DEVOTED HUSBAND AND, UM....
AND A MODEL DAD...
JUST LIKE ALL THE REST OF YOUR PALS, RIGHT?
EXCEPT FOR YOU, YOU'RE NOT EXACTLTY SQUEAKY CLEAN, ARE YOU, MARTY?
UM, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.
WHY DOES YOUR WIFE WANT A DIVORCE?
DIVORCE IS NOT THE RIGHT...
WHAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH...
A SEPARATION.
IT'S A TRIAL SEPARATION.
WHY?
UH, BECAUSE SHE FOUND OUT SOMETHING THAT SHE, UH, WASN'T TOO HAPPY ABOUT.
YOU FUCKED AROUND ON HER?
IF YOU WANNA BE TECHNICAL.
HOW'D SHE FIND OUT?
THE WOMAN WITH WHOM I...
FUCKED AROUND?
YEAH.
APPARENTLY EXPECTED SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE, AND SHE SHOWED UP ON OUR FRONT PORCH.
BITCH STARTED THE...
WOMAN, IN QUESTION, STARTED SAYING THINGS.
AND MY ONLY HOPE IS THAT MIMI WILL COME AROUND, EVENTUALLY, BECAUSE I LOVE HER VERY MUCH.
DID YOU GO, WITH THIS WOMAN, TO THE LOFT?
WHAT?
NO.
THIS HAPPENED IN SAN DIEGO.
WELL, THAT'S WHERE YOU MET THE WOMAN, RIGHT?
IN SAN DIEGO?
YEAH.
WHY YOU WERE THERE?
A COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE CONVENTION.
VINCE HAD A COUPLE EXTRA TICKETS, A VIP THING.
YOU KNOW, IT'S...
A COUPLE NIGHTS IN A FANCY HOTEL AND CHANCE TO GET AWAY FOR A COUPLE DAYS.
AND NIGHTS.
YEAH, NIGHTS, TOO.
MAN, YOU SEE THAT?
JESUS, VINCE, THOSE GIRLS ARE DROOLING ALL OVER YOU.
INVITE 'EM OVER.
I GOT FIRST DIBS.
I'LL BE HAPPY WITH SECOND BEST, TOO.
I DON'T TAKE A RAINCHECK ON THAT.
WHAT?
ARE YOU FUCKING CRAZY?
WHY WOULDN'T YOU INVITE THEM OVER?
'CAUSE, MARTY, I'D RATHER DIE FOR SOME RARE AND EXOTIC SEA CREATURE, THAN SHOOT FISH, IN A BARREL.
DOES BARBARA KNOW ABOUT THESE DEEP SEA EXPEDITIONS OF YOURS?
WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
YEAH!
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM, SEACORD?
I MEAN, YOU'VE GOT A KEY TO THE LOFT.
WHAT DO YOU DO UP THERE?
LAUNDRY?
DISHES?
HEY, ARE YOU GUYS HERE ON BUSINESS, OR WHAT?
I'M DANA.
MY FIRST TIME HERE.
IT'S A LITTLE OVER PRICED, FOR WHAT YOU GET.
DON'T YOU THINK?
HI, DANA, I'M VINCENT.
THIS IS, UH, MARTY, LUKE.
CAN WE, UH...
BUY YOU A DRINK?
HEY, WHEN I SAID OVER PRICED I WASN'T TROLLING FOR FREE BOOZE!
NO-NO.
I MEAN, I DIDN'T SAY...
WELL, SINCE YOU ASKED, WHAT'RE YOU DRINKING?
OHHH, CHAMPAGNE.
A GIRL CAN DREAM...
CHAMPAGNE?
PLEASE.
ALRIGHT, ONE CHAMPAGNE COMING UP.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
THE FAT CHICKS CAN SCARE OFF ALL THE HOT CHICKS.
MARTY, EVERY FAT CHICK HAS A GOOD LOOKING FRIEND.
HERS IS PROBABLY ON HER WAY DOWN, RIGHT NOW.
OK.
YEAH, WELL, WHAT IF SHE IS THE GOOD LOOKING FRIEND, AND THE REALLY FAT CHICK'S ON HER WAY DOWN?
I THINK THAT'S PHILIP'S FATHER-IN-LAW.
OH, YEAH, IT IS.
I'LL BE!
THAT'S THE MAN OF STEEL, ALRIGHT.
THAT AIN'T MRS. STEEL.
THINK WE SHOULD GIVE HIM A KEY?
MAYBE.
NOT MINE.
I'D LIKE A BOTTLE OF YOUR FINEST CHAMPAGNE, AND FOUR GLASSES, PLEASE, FOR THE TABLE IN THE CORNER.
YOU, UH...
WERE AT MY DAUGHTER'S WEDDING.
PHILIP'S FRIENDS.
YOU'RE THE ARCHITECT.
VINCENT STEVENS.
WE SHOULD TALK SOMETIME, MR. STEVENS.
SURE.
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT IN MIND, MR. FRY?
WE HAVE A NEW WATERFRONT PROJECT.
IT'S MASSIVE, IT'S...
CUTTING EDGE.
IT MIGHT BE RIGHT UP YOUR ALLEY.
OF COURSE, IT'S ALL PRELIMINARY.
WE HAVE TO KEEP IT UNDER WRAPS.
I HOPE YOU CAN BE DISCRETE.
SURE.
DISCRETION, MR. STEVENS, THAT'S THE MAIN THING.
DICTUM SAPIENTI SAT EST.
A WORD TO THE WISE.
YOU ARE WISE?
YEAH, SURE!
WISE, UH...
WISE AND DISCRETE, MR. FRY.
I'M IN SOFTWARE.
I CAN BE DISCRETE, MYSELF, AT ONCE.
I'LL PICK UP THEIR TAB, AS WELL.
HAVE A NICE EVENING, GENTLEMEN.
SWEETHEART?
SWEETHEART.
EXCUSE ME.
HI!
THIS IS ANNE.
LEAVE A MESSAGE.
WHO ARE YOU CALLING AT THIS HOUR?
WELL, I'M JUST...
CHECKING MY VOICEMAIL.
AND WHAT DOES YOUR VOICEMAIL SAY?
THAT YOU'RE A LOUSY LIAR, CHRIS VANOWEN?
WHAT ARE YOU TALK...?
SOMETHING WRONG?
YOU TELL ME, CHRIS.
ALLISON, I...
I'M GOING TO BED.
ALLISON!
EXCUSE ME, THIS IS NOT THINKING.
IT'S CALLED FOLLOWING YOUR DICK AROUND.
HEY, TWO KINDS OF ARTICLES, IN COSMO, MONTH AFTER MONTH.
ONE:
MEN ARE PIGS.
TWO:
HOW DO I SEDUCE A PIG TO TRY MY WOOD?
I DON'T READ COSMO, MONTH AFTER MONTH!
WELL, I DO.
I DON'T!
WELL, I DO.
AND I FIND IT STRANGELY...
YOU KNOW WHAT I FIND STRANGELY COMPELLING?
GRAB ASS.
HUH!
CAN'T LEAVE YOU ALONE FOR A MINUTE?
SARAH!
IT'S BEEN MORE LIKE AN HOUR.
YOU'D THINK I'D HAVE BEEN SUBSIDIZED.
AREN'T YOU GOING TO INTRODUCE ME TO YOUR NEW FRIENDS?
AND THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME YOU MET HER?
YEAH, THAT WAS, UH...
THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME.
SARAH?
YEAH.
HER NAME WAS SARAH.
MR. STEVENS, WHAT ELSE HAPPENED IN SAN DIEGO?
WHAT DO YOU WANNA KNOW?
EVERYTHING.
KEEP IT DOWN, KEEP IT DOWN.
THIS IS INSANE, SARAH.
YOU SHOULD NEVER DARE A CRAZY WOMAN.
VINCENT, WE SHOULD PROBABLY GO BACK.
WE'RE QUIET ENOUGH, IT'S OK.
MMM!
HMM.
SORRY, DON'T USE THE POOL.
NOW YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR END OF THE BARGAIN.
COME OVER HERE.
THAT'S BETTER.
YEAH...
OH, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
COME ON, DON'T KEEP US WAITING.
TAKE IT OFF.
I'M GONNA BE SICK.
WHAT?
VINCE'S BODY'S
NOT THAT BAD!
NOT VINCE!
SHRIMP COCKTAIL!
WHAT?
!
DANA...
DANA!
COME-COME BACK...
COME BACK HERE.
YOUR TURN.
TAKE IT ALL OFF.
NOT BAD.
IS THIS STILL TOO SCARY FOR YOU, LUKE?
ARE YOU GONNA JOIN US?
I'M-I'M FINE, RIGHT HERE.
I NEED YOU, 'CAUSE VINCENT'S GONNA TRY AND MAKE A MOVE ON ME, SOON, AND...
IF YOU'RE HERE, MAYBE HE WON'T DARE.
OR MAYBE VINCENT'S NOT INTERESTED.
MAYBE VINCENT'D RATHER DO LAPS.
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE LAST FEW HOURS OF CASUAL, BUT MEANINGFUL,
GLANCES THAT EACH LASTED A SECOND TOO LONG.
YOU LIKE TO PLAY GAMES, HUH?
I DO.
AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE.
I'M BETTER AT IT THAN YOU.
CAN YOU FEEL ME?
MOST DEFINITELY.
MARTY?
MARTY, I NEED MY ROOM KEY.
OH, DUDE!
KINDA BUSY HERE!
DON'T STOP!
GO!
GO!
SHIT!
YOU'RE SCARED, IS WHAT IT IS.
YOU'RE RUNNING AWAY FROM YOUR FEELINGS.
I WANT TO SAY GOODBYE.
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT IT'S LIKE TO REALLY LOVE SOMEONE?
I'M SORRY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
THROW IT AWAY.
IT'S EMPTY.
YOU WERE HERE YESTERDAY...
WEREN'T YOU?
GUYS...
WE GOTTA GO TO THE COPS.
WE'RE NOT GETTING ANYWHERE WITH THIS.
CHRIS, I THINK VINCENT HAS SOMETHING TO TELL YOU.
ALRIGHT, LET'S HEAR IT.
HELLO?
WHO IS IT?
WHO IS IT?
IT'S A REALTOR, WHO WANTS TO COME UP.
SOMEBODY'S LISTED THE LOFT FOR SALE?
WHAT?
!
OH, JESUS FUCKING...
LISTED THE LOFT?
SHE SAYS SHE HAS AN APPOINTMENT WITH A DEAKINS?
SARAH DEAKINS?
WHO-WHO'S SARAH DEAKINS?
WAIT...
WHO THE HELL IS TRYING TO SELL OUR LOFT?
YOU KNOW HER, MARTY.
WHAT?
YOU KNOW HER, AND SO DOES LUKE.
SARAH DEAKINS IS LYING ON THE BED.
HEY GUYS, I-I PROMISE, I HAVE NEVER SEEN A SARAH DEAKINS.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
YOU KNOW HER.
WHY DO YOU KEEP SAYING THAT?
YOU MET HER, IN SAN DIEGO.
THE LAST NIGHT, IN THE BAR, REMEMBER?
DANA'S FRIEND.
THE LAST NIGHT I-I WAS WASTED OUT OF MY MIND.
THE WHOLE NIGHT'S A BLUR.
JESUS!
LUKE, YOU...
YOU REMEMBER HER, DON'T YOU?
THAT'S SARAH?
YOU REMEMBER, SARAH?
YOU-YOU REMEMBER HER, RIGHT?
YES, I-I REMEMBER SARAH.
BUT HOW-HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT'S SARAH?
COME ON, GUYS, WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?
YOU GUYS TURNED HER OVER AND LOOKED AT HER FACE, I DID NOT.
YEAH, I THINK THERE'S BEEN A MISTAKE.
WE DON'T KNOW ANYONE NAMED SARAH DEAKINS.
ALRIGHT, COME ON.
WHO IS IT?
DO WE KNOW HER?
I DON'T KNOW.
FUCK!
SO, IS THAT ALL YOU WANNA TELL US, VINCE?
OR IS THERE MORE?
I HAD A, THING...
WITH HER.
I BROUGHT HER UP HERE A COUPLE OF TIMES.
BUT I SWEAR ON MY KIDS, I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.
WILL YOU JUST FUCKING TELL ME?
WERE YOU HERE WITH HER LAST NIGHT?
WERE YOU THE ONE WHO LET HER IN?
I BROKE UP WITH HER LAST NIGHT.
I SWEAR, SHE WAS ALIVE, WHEN I LEFT.
IT STILL DOESN'T EXPLAIN WHY SOMEONE LISTED THE LOFT!
SOMETHING SPECIAL, OR JUST BROWSING?
WHY DON'T YOU RETURN MY PHONE CALLS?
IF YOU'RE DUMPING ME, AT LEAST HAVE THE DECENCY...
CHRIS, HOW CAN I DUMP YOU?
THERE'S NOTHING BETWEEN US.
THAT'S WHAT IT MEANT TO YOU?
NOTHING.
DID YOU FORGET WHAT I TOLD YOU, ALREADY?
WHO I AM?
WHAT I DO?
NO, I HAVEN'T.
IT DOESN'T CHANGE HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU.
HOW MANY WOMEN HAVE YOU TAKEN TO THAT THAT FUCK PAD YOU SHARE WITH YOUR FOUR LITTLE BUDDIES?
WHAT?
PLEASE, CHRIS...
SAVE IT FOR SOME GIRL WHO'LL ACTUALLY BUY YOUR BULLSHIT.
NO, NO, WAIT, WAIT.
YOU KNOW I'M NOT LIKE THAT.
HERE.
I ONLY NEED THIS IF I'M WITH YOU.
SO YOU KEEP IT.
IF YOU WANNA SEE ME AGAIN, YOU LET ME KNOW.
CHRIS?
OH!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
SHOPPING FOR ALLISON?
UHH, NO, NO, UM, I WAS JUST...
HERE WITH A COLLEAGUE.
DOES YOUR WIFE KNOW YOU'VE BEEN SHARING A LOFT, WITH YOUR PALS?
I ALREADY TOLD YOU, I'M NOT SHARING A LOFT WITH ANY PALS.
I WAS THERE, JUST ONCE, AT A PARTY, WHEN THE BUILDING FIRST OPENED.
THEN, YOU HAVE BEEN THERE!
A MINUTE AGO, YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHERE THE BUILDING WAS.
I NEVER TOOK ANYONE UP THERE.
I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT YOU MEANT.
WELL, DID YOU KNOW THE GIRL?
WE MET ONCE, IN SAN DIEGO.
ARE YOU AWARE THAT MR. STEVENS BEGAN A RELATIONSHIP WITH HER IN SAN DIEGO?
THAT WOULD SURPRISE ME, FRANKLY.
YOU DIDN'T KNOW.
ISN'T VINCENT STEVENS YOUR BEST FRIEND?
IT'S SO OBVIOUS, WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE.
YOU'RE TRYING TO TURN US AGAINST EACH OTHER.
BUT GUESS WHAT?
I'M NOT ABOUT TO START TRASHING MY FRIEND.
IS IT POSSIBLE, MR. SEACORD, THAT YOU WERE JEALOUS OF YOU BEST FRIEND?
I MEAN, HE'S NAILING ALL THESE BEAUTIFUL WOMEN...
I AM A MARRIED MAN.
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN NAILING WOMEN.
I'M NOT JEALOUS OF VINCENT.
OH, NO...
I DIDN'T MEAN, JEALOUS OF HIM, MR. SEACORD.
I MEANT, JEALOUS OF THE WOMEN.
WHERE DO YOU GET OFF...
WITH AN INUENDO LIKE THAT?
FUCKING BASTARDS.
WHY SO ANGRY, MR. SEACORD?
VINCENT IS MY CLOSEST FRIEND, AND HE HAS BEEN FOR YEARS.
YEAH, FINE.
BUT YOUR BEST FRIEND IS SELLING YOU OUT, AS WE SPEAK, MR. SEACORD.
YOU AND THE REST OF YOUR GANG.
NO, VINCENT WOULD NEVER SELL OUT HIS FRIENDS, AND YOU'RE FULL OF SHIT, ASSHOLE.
WHAT YOU CALL ME?
YOU HEARD ME, YOU LYING PIECE OF SHIT!
LOOK, I BROKE UP WITH HER AND I LEFT, THAT'S IT.
YEAH?
AFTER YOU CUT HER UP WITH THIS, RIGHT?
PUT THE KNIFE DOWN.
PHILIP!
PUT THE KNIFE...
PUT THE KNIFE DOWN.
BACK OFF.
THE LOFT IS LISTED IN HER NAME.
THAT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE.
SOMEONE'S TRYING TO PIN THIS ON US.
ON YOU, YOU MEAN!
JESUS!
GET A FUCKING GRIP!
FUCK!
GUYS, WE CANNOT KEEP DOING THIS.
WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO, MARTY?
HUH?
JUST LEAVE ME HANGING?
HEY, VINCE?
VINCE?
ARE YOU IN THERE?
IF YOU'RE IN THERE, HEY, MAN, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU, FOR JUST A SECOND.
CHRIST, MARTY!
I GOT COMPANY.
DIDN'T YOU GET MY TEXT?
MIMI'S GONE!
SHE'S GONE.
FUCKING GONE.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, GONE?
GONE WHERE?
SHE LEFT ME.
SHE FOUND OUT ABOUT SAN DIEGO, THAT DUMPY CHICK.
SHE SHOWED UP AND THEN TOLD HER EVERYTHING.
FUCK!
WAIT A MINUTE!
YOU DIDN'T TELL MIMI ABOUT THE LOFT?
WHAT?
!
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE GODDAMN LOFT, VINCE.
IT'S ABOUT OF MY WIFE!
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO WITHOUT HER!
DID YOU-DID YOU CONFESS?
THEN, NEVER CONFESS, MARTY.
NEVER CONFESS.
WOULD YOU GO TO HER?
JUST-JUST TELL HER THAT I LOVE HER.
YOU KNOW, AND THAT DANA'S LYING.
SHE'LL BELIEVE YOU.
MARTY, I WILL STRAIGHTEN THIS OUT FOR YOU.
I PROMISE YOU, I WILL STRAIGHTEN THIS OUT.
OK.
HEY, COME HERE.
OK.
THANKS.
OK, SO, WHAT'S THE PLAN?
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?
WE GET HER OUT OF HERE.
WHAT?
WE CAN'T JUST MAKE A BODY DISAPPEAR.
WELL, IT'S TOO BAD.
IT'S OUR ONLY HOPE.
YOU HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH HER.
NOW SHE'S SOME...
INCONVENIENT PIECE OF EVIDENCE?
WHAT KIND OF MAN ARE YOU?
THAT'S A LAUGH, COMING FROM YOU.
AND HOW DO YOU PLAN TO GET HER OFF THE BED?
CUT OFF HER HAND?
OR DO YOU HAVE THE KEY TO THOSE CUFFS?
DO YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THOUGHT HANDCUFFS WERE MORE YOUR THING, THAN MINE, PHIL.
MEANING WHAT?
YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN!
SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
YOU JUST KEEP YOUR FUCKING MOUTH SHUT, ALRIGHT?
PLEASE!
HELP-HELP ME!
PLEASE, HELP ME!
KEEP YOUR FUCKING MOUTH SHUT.
THIS FUCKING WHORE'S TRYING TO RIP ME OFF.
PLEASE, HELP ME.
HE MADE ME...
SHUT UP, ALRIGHT?
!
HEY, TAKE IT EASY.
EASY!
ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT.
IT'S GONNA BE OK.
HE'S CRAZY!
SHIT!
OK, OK.
PHILIP, GIVE ME THE KEYS.
VINCE, SHE'S GONNA GO TO THE COPS, MAN.
THE KEYS FOR THE HANDCUFFS.
SHE'S GONNA GO TO THE COPS, MAN!
THE KEYS!
YOU WANT THE KEY?
HERE'S THE KEY.
HE MADE ME DO THINGS...
I DIDN'T WANNA DO.
SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
EASY!
WHAT, YOU WANT MORE MONEY?
THAT'S IT, RIGHT?
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE MONEY, HUH?
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE FUCKING MONEY!
HERE'S YOUR FUCKING MONEY!
IT'S RIGHT THERE!
JESUS CHRIST!
THE FUCK IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR FUCKING MIND?
SHE'S A WHORE, CHRIS.
YOU KNOW WHAT A WHORE IS?
SHUT UP!
YOU CAN'T RAPE A WHORE.
SHUT UP!
YOU CAN'T RAPE A WHORE!
YOU DON'T TREAT A WOMAN LIKE THAT!
YOU GOT IT?
NOT ANY WOMAN!
BACK THE FUCK AWAY!
HEY!
DON'T PUSH ME, ALRIGHT?
!
WHAT THE FUCK IS THE MATTER WITH YOU, MAN?
!
YOU'RE PUTTING US ALL AT RISK.
I WANT THE POLICE.
HE...
HE HIT ME.
SHUT UP.
MAKE THE COPS ARREST HIM!
HE RAPED ME!
SHUT UP!
STOP SCREAMING, OR I'M GONNA RIP YOUR GODDAMN THROAT OUT!
I'VE HAD IT WITH YOU!
YOU'RE NO BETTER THAN YOUR FATHER.
I'M WHAT?
YOU HEARD ME.
OH, RIGHT, CHRIS.
THAT'S A NICE ONE.
CHRIS HAD A BETTER DEAL WITH HIS DADDY, RIGHT?
THE GREAT GUY...
WHO WANTS TO SAVE EVERYONE.
WHERE WERE YOU...
WHEN ZOE AND I...
WERE GETTING BEAT UP?
AND MOM, IN THE NEXT ROOM, PRETENDING NOT TO HEAR.
WHERE WERE YOU?
IN YOUR COZY, COLLEGE DORM, GETTING LAID AND WASTED.
'CAUSE YOU DIDN'T GIVE A FUCK.
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
YOU DIDN'T GIVE A CRAP, ALL THOSE YEARS!
WE DIDN'T EXIST FOR YOU.
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT!
IF YOU WOULD'VE TOLD ME.
IF YOU WOULD'VE SAID SOMETHING.
THEN WHAT, YOU PHONY!
THEN, WHAT?
!
I WOULD'VE GOTTEN YOU OUT OF THERE, GODDAMN IT!
BOTH OF YOU!
LISTEN.
I'M REALLY, REALLY SORRY, BUT WE CAN'T GO TO THE COPS.
HERE'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO.
NO, LISTEN!
I'VE A FRIEND, HE'S A DOCTOR.
NO!
YES, I'M GONNA DRIVE YOU TO HIM.
HE'S GONNA TAKE CARE OF YOU, OK?
NO.
NOW, HERE, LISTEN...
TAKE IT.
I KNOW IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR WHAT HAPPENED TONIGHT, BUT...
HE'S AN ANIMAL.
HE SHOULD BE LOCKED UP.
OK.
AND WE'RE GONNA DEAL WITH HIM.
I PROMISE YOU.
COME ON.
I'M GONNA GET YOUR CLOTHES...
I'M GONNA TAKE TO YOU THE DOCTOR.
NO!
EASY, HERE WE GO.
NO!
I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU FOR THIS...
NEVER!
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?
JESUS CHRIST!
WHY-WHY DON'T I KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS?
AND WHEN DID IT HAPPEN?
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO.
WE DECIDED TO KEEP IT TO OURSELVES, 'CAUSE THAT'S THE KIND OF FRIENDS WE ARE.
DON'T LECTURE ME, ALRIGHT?
ESPECIALLY, ABOUT FRIENDSHIP.
OH, YOU-YOU'RE RIGHT, SORRY.
I MEANT TO GIVE YOU THE COKEHEAD RAPIST LECTURE.
FUCK YOU.
WELL, LOOK, YOU COULD SEE HOW I'D THINK YOU'D BE INVOLVED IN THIS.
I NEED TO SAY SOMETHING.
SHIT!
YOU HAD THAT COMING!
RELAX.
TAKE IT EASY.
YOU SON OF A BITCH.
YOU RECORDED...
EVERYTHING THAT WENT ON HERE?
EVERY WOMAN?
NOT EVERY.
NOT ALWAYS.
JUST...
SOMETIMES.
AT LEAST I DON'T CHEAT ON MY WIFE.
NO, YOU JUST WATCH US AND BEAT OFF.
YOU SICK FUCK.
YOU'RE A SICK FUCK!
LUKE, DID YOU RECORD LAST NIGHT?
NO.
YOU DIDN'T SAY YOU WERE COMING, WHICH IS AGAINST YOUR RULES.
AND IT WASN'T THE FIRST TIME YOU BROKE YOUR OWN RULES...
BY THE WAY.
NOW YOU'RE SCARED, AREN'T YOU?
NOW, YOU KNOW I'VE DOCUMENTED PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING YOU'VE BEEN UP TO, HERE.
NO WORRIES, VINCENT.
I'LL KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT, LIKE I ALWAYS DO.
DID YOU SEE ANYTHING THAT CAN HELP US OUT, HERE?
ANYTHING AT ALL.
IF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN HURT, AND CHEATED ON, FIND OUT THE TRUTH...
WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN, VINCENT?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE LEAVING, TOMORROW.
SERIOUS?
YOU LOVE SKIING!
YES, I LOVE TO SKI, BUT JUST NOT BY MYSELF.
ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN'T COME?
HEY, YOU KNOW I CAN'T COME.
I CAN'T JUST TAKE OFF LIKE THAT.
HEY.
I'LL CALL YOU EVERY DAY.
I LOVE YOU
I KNOW THE DRILL.
ONE HOUR, RIGHT?
WRONG!
HAVE A BLAST.
DON'T MIND ME.
WHY SHOULD TONIGHT BE ANY DIFFERENT FROM THE PAST FEW MONTHS?
LOOK, ALLISON, IF IT'S ALRIGHT WITH YOU, I'D RATHER NOT SPOIL TONIGHT.
I'M SURE IT MUST BE TEMPTING TO GRAB SOMETHING SHINY AND NEW.
BUT DO YOU EVER THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU MIGHT STAND TO LOSE, CHRIS?
YOU COULD RUIN MORE THAN JUST THIS EVENING.
TELL ME, ARE YOU STILL HAPPY, ALLISON?
OH, NO!
'CAUSE IT'S FOR CHARITY, MY MOTHER-IN-LAW IS ABOUT TO JOIN THE PARTY, FOR A LITTLE WHILE.
HEARING ANYTHING ABOUT THE WATERFRONT PROJECT?
NO, HE'S GONNA CALL ONCE HE GETS HIS PERMITS.
WELL, AS FAR AS I KNOW, EVERYTHING'S APPROVED.
REALLY?
YEAH.
GOOD EVENING, GENTLEMEN.
LADIES, YOU LOOK ABSOLUTELY RAVISHING, TONIGHT.
THANK YOU!
THIS IS VINCENT STEVENS.
HE'S THE ARCHITECT WHO
DESIGNED THE NEW LOFT BUILDING, NEAR THE SPORTS ARENA.
OH, WONDERFUL!
I LOVE THAT BUILDING.
WHY, THANK YOU, MRS. KOTKIN.
I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.
AS I WAS SAYING, TO YOUR HUSBAND, IN, UH, SAN DIEGO...
GENTLEMEN, IN OUR BUSINESS, CAN'T AFFORD TO BE...
EXPOSED TO THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF BAD DESIGN.
SPEAKING OF, UH...
SAN DIEGO...
HOW'S THAT WATERFRONT PROJECT COMING ALONG?
OH, YES, UH...
WE'RE STILL WORKING IT ON.
WE'VE APPLIED FOR ALL OUR PERMITS.
NOW WE'RE WAITING.
STANDING IN LINE, LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.
YOU DON'T STRIKE ME AS THE TYPE OF MAN THAT STANDS IN LINE, MR. FRY.
WHAT ABOUT YOU, MR. KOTKIN.
ARE YOU A GAMBLING MAN?
AND YOU, MR. STEVENS?
YOU LIKE TO TAKE CHANCES?
AS A MATTER OF FACT, I DO.
ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M HOLDING A HANDFUL OF HEARTS.
ANYWAY, I DON'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT.
LADIES, IF YOU'RE AS LUCKY ON THE TABLES TONIGHT, AS YOU ARE IN LOVE,
THEN I AM SURE YOU'LL HIT YOUR JACKPOTS.
GENTLEMEN, ALWAYS A PLEASURE.
BLACKJACK.
SET ASIDE ENOUGH FOR THE ALIMONY.
MIMI, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
JUST 'CAUSE I BELIEVED YOU, THAT DOESN'T MEAN I'M STUCK AT HOME.
MIMIKIN, I WANNA COME BACK.
I KNOW I SCREWED UP, ONCE.
ONCE!
I WAS DRUNK OFF OF MY ASS.
I SWEAR IT DIDN'T MEAN A DAMN THING.
SOMETHING I DON'T UNDERSTAND ABOUT MEN.
IF IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING, WHY BOTHER?
I PROMISE I'LL CHANGE.
INTO WHAT, A FROG?
SO, IF YOU'RE NOT A PRINCE, HOW ABOUT THE ASS YOU ALREADY ARE?
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU I WANTED TO FUCK AROUND TONIGHT?
SORRY...
IT WOULD HURT LIKE HELL, WOULDN'T IT?
HEY, MAYBE I ALREADY GOT EVEN!
MAYBE WITH ONE OF YOUR PALS, HUH?
MAYBE CHRIS?
HE'S CUTE.
OR HOW ABOUT VINCENT?
THE NIGHT YOU SENT HIM OVER FOR THAT TRAGIC, HEART TO HEART.
OH, MARTY'S REALLY SO SORRY.
MIMI, YOU GOTTA TALK TO HIM.
BLACKJACK.
OH!
WELL, LOOK AT THAT, CHUBBS!
YOUR FIRST EVER WINNING STREAK.
JUST REMEMBER, DEAR HEART...
HALF OF IT IS MINE.
YOU GAVE ZOE TICKETS, TONIGHT?
PHILIP, LET GO.
I KEEP HER AWAY FROM BULLSHIT LIKE THIS, AND YOU'RE BEHIND MY BACK...
CHRIST, PHIL, SHE'S ALMOST 20 YEARS OLD.
WHAT ARE YOU, HER FATHER?
DID YOU SEE HER?
GOD, SHE LOOKS LIKE A HOOKER.
I THOUGHT YOU LIKE WHORES.
LET HER HAVE SOME FUN.
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I'M ABOUT TO HAVE SOME FUN, TOO.
I'M KINDA ON A ROLL.
YEAH?
YEAH, YEAH.
I HOPE YOU WIN BIG TIME.
YOU'LL NEED IT WITH ALL THE SHIT YOU'VE BEEN PACKING UP YOUR NOSTRILS.
OH!
SO YOU NOTICED, A TINY FRACTION OF YOUR STASH WENT MISSING?
YOU DON'T LIKE IT, FILE FOR DIVORCE.
I HAVEN'T RULED THAT OUT.
DON'T FORGET ABOUT OUR PRENUP, LOSER.
WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, GO PLAY SOME BLACKJACK.
COULD BE YOUR LAST BEST CHANCE OF PAYING THE RENT.
CAN I GET SOME DICE OVER HERE?
ANNE?
ANNE?
WE NEED TO TALK.
YEAH, ABOUT WHAT?
YOUR PAL, THE ARCHITECT.
HE'S PLAYING WITH FIRE.
I'D ACTUALLY RATHER TALK ABOUT ANNE.
I'LL PASS ALONG YOUR MESSAGE TO VINCENT, BUT I'D LIKE SOMETHING, TOO, MR. KOTKIN.
I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO STOP SEEING ANNE.
AND WHY WOULD I DO THAT?
BECAUSE I LOVE HER.
THEN WE HAVE MORE IN COMMON THAN WE THOUGHT.
I'D LIKE YOU TO STOP PAYING HER.
I WANT YOU TO LET HER GO.
THAT'S REALLY NOT UP TO ME.
FACT IS, IT'S TOTALLY HER CHOICE.
EXCEPT I NEVER PAID FOR HER.
WELL, THAT'S TRUE.
YOU NEVER PAID.
STOP IT, JOEL!
I'M GOING.
WHAT DID HE MEAN BY THAT?
'YOU NEVER PAID.' I DON'T WANNA LOVE YOU, CHRIS.
IS HE SAYING SOMEONE'S PAYING YOU TO BE WITH ME?
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN HURT ME.
ANNE.
TELL ME IT'S A LIE.
THE FIRST TIME, IT WAS PAID FOR.
EVERY OTHER TIME, THAT WAS REAL, THAT WAS ME.
BUT, WHO PAID?
I CAN'T.
EXCUSE ME.
COME ON, ZOE, LET'S GO.
I'M FINE HERE.
I'M ASKING YOU TO GO WITH ME.
COME ON.
I'M ASKING YOU TO STOP.
OK, COME ON.
DID YOU NOT HEAR THE LADY?
MIND YOUR BUSINESS!
STOP IT!
WHAT, ARE YOU DEAF OR JUST A DICK, HUH?
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
WHAT DOES IT SAY UP HERE?
DEAF OR DICK?
HELP ME OUT, HUH?
COME ON!
EXCUSE ME!
THANK YOU.
EXCUSE ME.
YOU'RE NOT MY DAD!
SHUT UP!
ALRIGHT, SOMEBODY GET THIS GUY AN AMBULANCE.
I NEVER WANNA SEE YOU AGAIN.
NOT IN MY HOME AND NOT NEAR MY DAUGHTER.
DO YOU GOT THAT?
GET HIM THE HELL OUTTA HERE.
OK, FOLKS, LET'S GET BACK TO THE GAMING TABLE, SHALL WE?
HEY...
IT'S OK.
I'M SORRY.
HEY, IT'S OK.
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
WHAT I AM THINKING?
SHE'S MY FRIEND'S SISTER, OK?
ARE THERE MORE?
BESIDES ME, HER AND YOUR WIFE.
WHAT'S THE GRAND TOTAL?
LOOK, I CAN'T HAVE THIS CONVERSATION HERE.
BARBARA'S STANDING RIGHT OVER THERE.
DO YOU LOVE ME?
OF COURSE, I LOVE YOU.
I'M CRAZY ABOUT YOU.
SO WOULD YOU CHOOSE, ME, IF YOU COULD?
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.
COME MEET ME IN THE LOFT, TOMORROW, OK.
WE'LL TALK IT THROUGH.
YOU'RE RIGHT, IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.
BUT MAYBE I CAN MAKE IT SIMPLE.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
MAYBE I CAN HELP YOU MAKE THAT CHOICE.
SARAH.
SARAH.
SARAH!
SARAH!
I'M SORRY!
ARE YOU ALRIGHT?
DON'T DO IT, SARAH.
YOU'LL REGRET IT.
THEY FOUND OUT.
THE WIVES, THEY DID IT.
THEY SET US UP.
WHY, VINCENT?
THEY FOUND IT.
THEY FOUND OUT.
THEY FOUND OUT ABOUT THE LOFT.
WHY WOULD YOU DO IT, VINCENT?
WE'RE YOUR FRIENDS.
NO.
WHY'D YOU DO IT?
NO, IT WAS...
THE WIVES, THEY...
THEY FOUND OUT.
NO, IT'S YOUR FRIENDS.
WE FOUND OUT.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
YOU STILL DON'T GET IT.
ALRIGHT, LET'S STRIP HIM.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU ARE A TOTAL FUCKING PSYCHOPATH.
I DID WHAT YOU TOLD ME.
I DIDN'T TELL YOU TO FUCKING CUT HER OPEN!
IT WASN'T PART OF THE PLAN.
AND THE LATIN ON THE FABRIC!
THE COPS AREN'T GONNA BELIEVE THAT BULLSHIT.
YEAH, YOU SHOULD'VE DONE IT YOURSELF.
COME ON, LET'S DO THIS.
WHAT'D YOU GIVE ME?
WHAT YOU DESERVE.
YOU KILLED SARAH?
NO, WE JUST FOUND HER.
WHAT?
WE WERE HERE, THIS MORNING, VINCENT, BEFORE YOU ARRIVED.
JESUS CHRIST.
AT FIRST, I THOUGHT SHE WAS SLEEPING.
VINCENT KNOWS HER?
SHE-SHE LEFT HIM THIS.
SEE YOU IN THE NEXT LIFE.
WHY DID SHE HAVE TO DO IT HERE?
WE GOTTA CALL THE COPS.
THEY-THEY INVESTIGATE SUICIDES.
THIS IS ALL GONNA COME OUT.
GUYS, WAIT.
CAN'T WE FIND OUT, WHERE SHE LIVES, AND-AND LEAVE HER THERE?
JESUS!
PHILIP!
COME ON!
WE HAVE TO HELP OUT VINCE.
YEAH, SPEAKING OF WHICH, WHERE THE FUCK IS VINCE?
ISN'T THIS HIS PROBLEM?
AHEMMM.
VINCENT ISN'T HERE, BECAUSE, UM...
BECAUSE I DIDN'T CALL HIM.
YOU DIDN'T CALL HIM?
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL HIM?
THERE'S SOMETHING I HAVE TO SHOW YOU.
YOU'VE BEEN TAPING US?
!
YOU FUCKING PERVERT!
YOU CAN BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF ME, LATER.
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME, AND WE NEED TO WATCH THIS.
IF WE GET A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT HAPPENED UPSTAIRS...
MAYBE YOU'LL AGREE...
WE SHOULDN'T TAKE THE HIT FOR VINCENT'S FUCKUP.
YOU SEE, VINCENT...
VINCENT HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN A GOOD FRIEND.
NO...
HEY, MAYBE I ALREADY GOT EVEN...
OR MAYBE VINCENT, THE NIGHT YOU SENT HIM OVER, FOR THAT TRAGIC, HEART TO HEART.
THEY GOT HERE LATE, THE NIGHT HE WENT TO TALK TO HER.
SHE WAS DRUNK, MARTY.
HE TOOK ADVANTAGE.
WOW!
YOUR LITTLE SISTER IS SERIOUSLY HOT!
HOW LONG HAS...?
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
HOW LONG?
HE STARTED SEEING HER RIGHT AFTER YOUR WEDDING.
THEY MET HERE, ON A REGULAR BASIS.
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, HE WAS HER FIRST.
FUCK!
GORGEOUS, HUH?
THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE...
THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN HURT YOU.
HE PAID ANNE...
TO LET YOU SEDUCE HER.
PUT THE HOOK IN, SO YOU'D WANNA SHARE THE LOFT.
THE FIRST TIME, IT WAS PAID FOR.
HAVE FUN.
CHRIS, PLEASE, YOU DON'T KNOW THE HALF OF IT, ALRIGHT?
JUST GO HOME.
HE USED HER, CHRIS.
JUST LIKE HE USED EVERYONE.
EVERYONE.
I'M GONNA KILL THAT SON OF A BITCH.
VINCENT CAN'T SENSE ANYTHING IS UP, WHEN HE WALKS IN.
WE HAVE TO TRY AND REMAIN CALM.
WE'RE GONNA GET QUESTIONED BY THE COPS.
THAT'S WHY WE CAN NEVER ADMIT WE'RE SHARING THIS LOFT.
THEY'LL TRY TO TURN US AGAINST EACH OTHER.
OK.
I THINK THIS CAN WORK.
AS LONG WE FOLLOW THE PLAN.
CHRIS?
OK.
I'M IN.
BUT, ONLY IF WE KNOW FOR SURE, THAT VINCENT WAS HERE LAST NIGHT.
I WANNA HEAR HIM SAY IT.
AND IF HE DOES, I'LL GO THROUGH WITH IT.
I'LL GIVE A SIGNAL, UH...
BREAK SOMETHING, A GLASS...
BUT NOTHING HAPPENS, UNTIL WE KNOW FOR SURE.
UNDERSTOOD?
WE'VE GOT JUST UNDER TWO HOURS TO SET EVERYTHING UP AND ESTABLISH ALIBIS.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.
YOU GUYS GET OUTTA HERE.
MAKE SURE PEOPLE SEE YOU.
YOU HAVE THE SUICIDE NOTE, RIGHT?
I'VE GOT IT.
YOU KNEW WHAT THAT PRICK WAS UP TO.
AND YOU NEVER SAID ANYTHING.
YOU'RE JUST AS SICK AS VINCENT.
THEY MET HERE ON A REGULAR BASIS.
VINCENT HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN A GOOD FRIEND.
HE STARTED SEEING HER RIGHT AFTER YOUR WEDDING.
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, HE WAS HER FIRST.
YOU ARE A TOTAL FUCKING PSYCHOPATH.
I DID WHAT YOU TOLD ME.
I DIDN'T TELL YOU TO FUCKING CUT HER OPEN.
IT WASN'T PART OF THE PLAN.
AND THE LATIN ON THE FABRIC!
THE COPS AREN'T GONNA BELIEVE THAT BULLSHIT!
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?
YOU'RE FRAMING ME!
SWALLOW IT.
SWALLOW.
MY OWN FRIENDS.
MY OWN FRIENDS!
AM I GONNA DIE?
NO, VINCENT, YOU'RE NOT GONNA DIE.
SARAH LURED YOU HERE AND DRUGGED YOU.
THEN SHE KILLED HERSELF, WITH YOU BY HER SIDE.
FATE WILL UNITE US.
BUT YOU'RE GONNA SURVIVE.
'CAUSE WE'RE FRIENDS, AREN'T WE?
SO, YOU SEE?
IT WAS A SETUP.
SARAH AND I WERE SET UP.
THE WHOLE THING WAS STAGED.
STILL SOUNDS A LITTLE UNBELIEVABLE, DON'T YOU THINK?
UNBELIEVABLE, BUT IT'S THE TRUTH.
YEAH.
MY LINE OF WORK, YOU GOTTA PROVE THE TRUTH, AND YOU PROVE IT WITH FACTS AND FINDINGS.
FACT IS, WE ONLY FOUND YOUR PRINTS AND THOSE OF SARAH DEAKINS.
YEAH, BECAUSE THEY WIPED THE PLACE CLEAN.
AND WE HAVE THE DVDS OF ALL YOUR SEXUAL EXPLOITS, WITH YOUR PRINTS ALL OVER THEM.
LUKE MADE THOSE DVD'S!
I NEITHER EVEN SAW 'EM, LET ALONE, TOUCHED 'EM.
YEAH, BUT WE'VE GOT NO DVDS OF YOUR FRIENDS.
NO DVDS OF MARTY'S WIFE.
NO DVDS OF PHILIP'S SISTER.
NO DVDS OF CHRIS' GIRLFRIEND, ALRIGHT?
FACTS AND FINDINGS, MR. STEVENS.
AND WE GOT NO EVIDENCE THAT YOU WERE BEING SET UP.
ALRIGHT.
IS THERE ANYTHING WE'VE FORGOTTEN?
YEAH, TO FOLLOW THE FUCKING PLAN.
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST HANDCUFF HER?
SHE WAS ALREADY DEAD.
STILL NO REASON TO MUTILATE HER.
SHE KILLED HERSELF.
I JUST MADE IT MORE DRAMATIC.
YEAH, WELL, YOU BETTER HOPE YOUR DRAMATICS DON'T PUT US IN JAIL.
LOOK, JUST-JUST LEAN ON 'EM A LITTLE BIT.
MARTY WILL BREAK, MAYBE LUKE, TOO.
LOOK, DON'T TELL ME HOW TO DO MY WORK, ALRIGHT?
WE QUESTIONED THEM ALL.
I GOT NO REASON TO BELIEVE THEY'VE BEEN LYING.
PLUS, ALL YOUR FRIENDS HAVE ALIBIS.
ALIBIS?
NOT FOR THIS MORNING, THEY DON'T.
WE GOT LUKE SEACORD AND CHRIS VANOWEN, TOGETHER, AT BREAKFAST.
WE GOT MARTY LANDRY, AT HIS OFFICE, ALRIGHT?
AT HIS OFFICE?
LOOK...
FOR AT LEAST AN HOUR, THIS MORNING, WE WERE ALL IN THE LOFT.
SO WAS PHIL.
WHAT ABOUT PHIL?
ACTUALLY, HE'S DOWNSTAIRS, RIGHT NOW, WITH HIS FATHER-IN-LAW.
FRY?
WHAT THE FUCK'S FRY DOING HERE?
HE JUST GAVE A STATEMENT.
SAYING THAT HE WAS WITH HIS SON-IN-LAW, ALL DAY.
THAT IS BULLSHIT!
THAT IS A FALSE STATEMENT!
AND WHY WOULD HE LIE?
HIRAM FRY BRINGS A LOT OF CREDIBILITY.
CREDIBILI...
I SAW FRY, IN SAN DIEGO, WITH SOME...
BIMBO, OK?
PHIL KNEW THAT.
HE KNEW I PRESSURED FRY INTO GIVING ME A WATERFRONT CONTRACT.
SO YOU TRIED TO BLACKMAIL HIRAM FRY?
VINCENT STEVENS, ENOUGH OF THIS CRAP.
WE GOT YOUR PRINTS ALL OVER THE DVDS, WE GOT 'EM ALL OVER THE KNIFE.
WE GOT YOU CHAINED, NEXT TO THE DEAD GIRL, ON THE BED, ALRIGHT?
CALL YOUR LAWYER.
MAKE A CONFESSION AND SAVE YOUR ASS.
YOU'RE FREE TO GO.
I WANNA THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION.
YOU UNDERSTAND, WE HAD TO CHECK OUT YOUR FRIEND'S STORY.
OF COURSE, THAT'S YOUR JOB.
THERE'S JUST...
ONE THING THAT'S BOTHERING ME.
WHY DOES VINCENT STEVENS KEEP ACCUSING HIS BEST FRIENDS?
I-I DON'T KNOW.
IT BOTHERS ME, TOO.
COULD IT BE...
I JUST...
I JUST WONDER...
YOU THINK HE'S TRYING TO HIDE SOMETHING ELSE?
WHA-WHAT, WHAT WOULD HE HIDING?
SARAH DEAKINS' MURDER.
MURDER?
BUT...
THE DETECTIVE, IN THE INTERROGATION, CALLED IT A SUICIDE.
WELL, THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE.
BUT THE AUTOPSY
REPORT REVEALED THAT SLEEPING PILLS DIDN'T KILL HER.
AND, HER WRIST WAS CUT, BUT NOT BY SARAH.
HESITATION MARKS, THOSE...
TENTATIVE ATTEMPTS,
THE FIRST ONES, BEFORE A SUICIDE ACTUALLY SLASHES THROUGH AN ARTERY.
THE CORONER DIDN'T FIND THOSE ON HER.
BUT, VINCENT...
HE, UH...
HE WOULD NEVER...
HIS PRINTS ARE ON THE KNIFE.
WE DIDN'T FIND A SUICIDE NOTE.
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?
WE DIDN'T FIND A SUICIDE NOTE.
YOU HAVE THE SUICIDE NOTE, RIGHT?
I'VE GOT IT...
LUKE.
CHRIS!
YOU SCARED ME.
YOU SURE IT'S SMART...
MEETING HERE?
I THINK WE HAVE A PROBLEM, LUKE.
HOW SO?
WHERE IS SARAH'S SUICIDE NOTE?
YOU PUT IT IN YOUR POCKET.
YEAH, COULDA SWORN, I DID.
BUT IT'S NOT THERE ANY MORE.
SO, WHEN DID YOU STEAL IT FROM MY COAT?
WHEN THE DOORBELL RANG THIS MORNING?
SURPRISE VISIT, FROM THE REALTOR?
CHRIS, IT'S, UH...
IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT YOU LOST SARAH'S SUICIDE NOTE, BUT...
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT.
I CALLED THE AGENCY TO ASK WHO PUT OUR LOFT UP FOR SALE.
ALL THEY COULD GIVE ME WAS A NUMBER.
I DID CALL THEM.
I WANTED TO...
I THOUGHT, MAYBE THAT...
IT'S OVER, CHRIS.
WE PULLED IT OFF.
WE'VE GOT NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT, NOW.
BUT, WHY'D THAT NOTE DISAPPEAR?
THE ONLY REAL PROOF OF HER SUICIDE?
HELLO?
SAYS SHE'S GOT AN APPOINTMENT WITH SOMEONE NAMED SARAH DEAKINS?
WHO'S SARAH DEAKINS?
IS IT BECAUSE MAYBE SHE DIDN'T WRITE IT?
MAYBE IT'S YOUR HANDWRITING?
VINCENT FUCKED US ALL.
YOU SAW.
YEAH, I SAW.
ALL THE DVDS THAT MADE EVERYBODY CRAZY.
WENT RIGHT ALONG WITH YOUR GRAND PLAN, DIDN'T IT?
BUT WHY, LUKE?
WHAT DID YOU DO TO THAT GIRL?
DID SHE GET IN YOUR WAY?
BETWEEN YOU AND VINCENT?
ACTUALLY, IT WAS VINCENT...
STANDING BETWEEN US.
IS THERE SOMEONE ELSE?
MUCH...
SARAH!
WAIT.
FORGET VINCENT.
HE'S BETTER AT GAMES THAN YOU.
ALWAYS WAS, ALWAYS WILL BE.
HE'S HURTING YOU.
USING YOU.
WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS?
I'M TELLING YOU BECAUSE...
BECAUSE I'D NEVER HURT YOU.
JUST GIVE ME THE CHANCE...
TO SHOW I'D NEVER HURT YOU.
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU'D NEVER HURT ME.
BECAUSE I FEEL NOTHING FOR YOU, LUKE.
I'M SORRY.
MAYBE IN ANOTHER LIFE.
YOU WERE HERE LAST NIGHT?
BARBARA WAS OFF SKIING.
SO I FIGURED I'D FIND VINCENT HERE...
WITH SARAH.
I'M SORRY.
I WAITED 'TIL HE LEFT.
SHE SAID I WAS RIGHT ABOUT VINCENT.
CONSOLING...
I'VE GOTTEN SO GOOD AT IT.
I GAVE HER AN INSULIN OD.
IT'S QUICK, PAINLESS.
LEAVES NO TRACE.
JESUS, LUKE.
I DID IT OUT OF LOVE...
I SWEAR.
AND VINCENT TAKING THE FALL FOR THIS.
IT'S OK WITH YOU?
VINCENT USED EVERYONE AND ANYONE!
IT'S ABOUT TIME WE TURNED THE TABLES!
WELL, HE'S BEING CHARGED WITH MURDER.
YEAH.
SARAH WASN'T DEAD, WHEN YOU LEFT HER WITH PHILIP.
NO...
NO, YOU'RE LYING.
NO.
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.
WHAT PHILIP DID TO HER...
WAS SICK.
YOU'RE SICK, LUKE.
BUT...
IF I'M HEARING YOU RIGHT...
IT WAS YOUR BROTHER...
WHO KILLED SARAH.
OK, CHRIS.
GO HOME.
I'LL CLEAN UP.
LIKE ALWAYS.
NO.
NO MORE CLEANING UP, LUKE.
STEP OUTSIDE.
LUKE.
NOW.
JESUS!
LET ME HELP YOU, LUKE, PLEASE!
YOU GONNA KILL ME, TOO?
IT'S YOUR OWN FAULT.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO, JUMP?
YES, IF YOU DON'T MIND!
LUKE!
YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THIS.
JESUS CHRIST, LUKE.
WILL YOU STOP IT?
I DON'T WANNA HURT YOU, CHRIS.
I REALLY DON'T.
SO JUST DO IT.
NEVER!
I CALLED THE COPS, BEFORE I CAME.
I TOLD THEM EVERYTHING.
BULLSHIT!
I KNOW YOU HAVEN'T.
I THOUGHT I KNEW YOU.
WHAT ABOUT THE NOTE, HUH?
YOU WANT THIS TO GO DOWN WITH ME, TOO?
GIVE ME THAT NOTE, CHRIS.
GIVE IT TO ME!
IT'S OVER, LUKE.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT IS OVER.
TELL ALLIE AND THE KIDS...
I'M SORRY.
WOULD YOU DO THAT FOR ME, CHRIS?
NO, COME ON, CHRIS.
BE A FRIEND.
LUKE!
LUKE!
LUKE!
LUKE!
LUKE!
THEY'RE MARRIED.
HONEY, NO.
THEY'RE HAVING AN AFFAIR.
BECAUSE SHE'S LAUGHING AT HIS JOKES?
NO, I'M TELLING YOU THEY'RE HAVING AN AFFAIR.
WELL, SINCE WHEN ARE YOU THE BIG EXPERT ON AFFAIRS?
REALLY?
THANKS FOR TAKING ME BACK, MEEMS.
WELL, WHAT WAS MY ALTERNATIVE?
TO LEAVE YOU WAILING AT
THE FRONT DOOR, WITH SNOT POURING OUT OF YOUR NOSE?
SORRY, DIDN'T MEAN TO SCARE YOU OFF.
I HAVE THE KIDS EARLY TOMORROW, SO I GOTTA GO.
ARE YOU GONNA LEAVE ME HERE, ALONE?
WITH MY WIFE?
YES.
COME ON,
WE CAN AT LEAST HAVE ONE MORE DRINK.
THERE'LL BE PLENTY MORE DRINKS.
GOODNIGHT, MEEMS.
GOOD NIGHT, CHRIS.
CHRIS!
ANNE?
HI.
HI.
YOU LOOK GOOD.
THANK YOU, YOU, TOO.
LISTEN, I STILL HAVE THE KEY.
DO YOU WANT IT BACK?
IT WON'T WORK ANYMORE.
VINCENT'S LIVING THERE ALONE, NOW.
IT'S THE ONLY THING HIS WIFE LET HIM KEEP.
AND, UH...
AND PHILIP?
HE'S AWAITING TRIAL.
WE'LL SEE.
AND YOU?
YOU DOING OK?
YEAH.
MOST OF THE TIME.
AND THE REST OF THE TIME?
I HEARD YOU DITCHED THE CITY COUNCILMAN?
THAT'S NOT ALL I'VE GIVEN UP.
UH, DO YOU WANNA GRAB A CUP OF COFFEE, OR...?
THE END
SUBTITLES BY KOUSHIK DAS
I swear to God I had nothing to do with this.
We would love to believe you, Mr. Stevens, but you have to admit your version of events does sound pretty bizarre, don't you think?
Look.
It was a setup, okay?
The whole thing was staged.
So you were framed.
That's your claim?
You were the victim.
Well, I mean, you know, not... not like...
Not like who?
Not like her?
Please, just talk to the other guys.
Have you talked to the others yet?
We're doing our jobs.
So why don't you just do yourself a favor and confess?
You know, save some time, save some legal fees.
Come on.
Why don't you take us through the events of this morning?
- Again?
- Again, Mr. Stevens.
Where were you this morning, Mr. Stevens?
I was at home, alone.
My wife's taken the kids skiing.
Actually your wife's on her way back, as we speak.
Apparently, she has...
quite a few questions of her own.
So the phone woke you around what time this morning?
I don't know. 9:00, 9:30.
It was Luke in a panic.
He said I had to come.
Where were you supposed to go?
To the loft.
He told me to come to the loft.
- Did he say why he was panicking?
- No.
- Did you know why he was panicking?
- No, not yet.
Luke.
Luke?
Oh, my God.
Oh, fuck.
- What the hell happened?
- I don't know.
- What do you mean?
You just...
What...
- I walked in, she was lying there.
Oh, fuck.
- Have you called the others?
- Chris and Marty are on their way.
I...
I still haven't reached Philip.
Okay, well, keep calling.
We need everybody here.
Do you know who she is?
Vincent, do you know who's lying there?
What?
No, of course not.
How the fuck did they get in?
Was it a window, a door or...
Windows are sealed, the door was locked, and the alarm was turned off.
- That's impossible.
- I'm telling you, the door was locked.
And the alarm was turned off.
- But that would mean that...
- Someone got in with one of our keys.
Do you know the loft building at the corner of Second and South Hope, Mr. Seacord?
- No.
- The new residential one by the Sports Arena?
Designed, I believe, by your good friend Vincent Stevens.
Vincent runs a very large firm.
He's done a lot of buildings.
There's a loft on the ninth floor, Mr. Seacord.
Have you ever been there?
No.
Strange, because according to our information, you and four friends are sharing this loft secretly, without your wives' knowledge.
That is ridiculous.
Don't the five of you bring women up there?
Girlfriends, mistresses, one-night stands, catch of the day.
Five pals just looking for privacy and fun without the hassle of Visa statements and hotel bills the missus might find.
- That is preposterous.
- Maybe, Mr. Seacord, but one of your friends already made a full confession.
You want to know who?
Listen, I don't do things like that.
You know?
Fool around with other women.
I...
- You love your wife.
- I love my wife, yes.
What happened to your face, Mr. Seacord?
- I walked into a door.
- Or were you in a fight?
- I said I walked into a door.
- Where were you this morning?
Out with Chris, having breakfast.
There will be a lot of people in the restaurant to verify that.
By Chris, you mean Dr. Chris Vanowen, the psychiatrist?
- That's right.
- One of your loft buddies?
Chris is married.
He's got two kids.
And he's not a guy who cheats on his wife either.
I got a serious fuckin' problem, Chris.
Oh, shit.
Philip.
Philip?
You think your brother has something to do with this?
I don't know.
We gotta call the cops.
You realize what'll happen if we call the cops?
Think about our wives.
- There's a dead woman here, Vincent.
- Why do we think Philip is involved?
Look, Chris, you know what he's capable of.
Yeah, I know.
Maybe we can help him, okay?
If we can just figure out what the fuck happened,
- maybe we could...
- We gonna dump the body somewhere?
Look, I don't fucking know, but I'm not taking the fall for this!
- Marty.
- Son of a bitch.
Have you seen Phil?
Do you know where he is?
Was he here last night?
This can't be real.
No.
Wait, what are you doing?
I want to see her.
Just put her back.
- Goddamn it.
- Who is she?
I don't know.
Look, none of us has anything to do with this, right?
Right?
We're gonna find out what happened here, and we will figure a way out.
We're in this together.
We'll get out of it together.
Okay?
'Cause we're friends.
Agreed?
Agreed?
Well, it looks like they'll let anybody in, right?
- Congratulations, man.
- Thanks.
- This one's really spectacular, very special.
- I appreciate that.
Ally, it's been too long.
You look terrific.
Thank you.
- So, what do you think?
- Well, it's bold and focused, as always.
- I like it.
- Great.
You made it.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- Hi, Barbara.
How are you?
- Want to buy yourselves a little condo?
I think Vincent's little condos are a little out of our league.
Right.
You and your puny psychiatrist's salary.
You guys grab a drink and we'll catch up with you later.
- All right.
Congrats, bud.
- Thanks, man.
- One hour tops, and then we're out of here.
- Come on, hon.
We just got here.
Man, check out all these babes.
So hot!
It's like they're in violation of the fuckin' fire code.
Marty, calm down.
I see them.
I can also see Mimi, your wife.
- Okay, save me, help me, protect me.
- What's up, Tubs?
Having too much fun?
Nope.
Just checkin' out the hipster crowd with my pal Luke.
Yeah, if you embarrass me, I'll leave you here all by yourself.
Oh, don't raise my hopes only to dash them.
Hi, Luke.
Where's Ellie?
She was just feeling dizzy.
Ducked out to check her blood sugar.
Hi, Elle.
Do you feel okay?
Oh, I started to feel not so great before, but I'm better now.
We can always go home, sweetie.
Did you hear that? "Sweetie." After she just checked her blood sugar.
That's funny.
That's really good.
I would love to see you deal with something like that if that was me.
Oh, you know, baby.
I'd love to stick you in the ass every day.
- How many times have I asked?
Lots.
- Honey?
Not now.
- You're the shrink, aren't you?
- Yeah, that's right.
Chris Vanowen.
Dr. Vanowen.
That's right.
Yes, I remember.
- Do we know each other?
- No.
You knew my sister.
She was a patient of yours actually.
Sophie?
Sophie Morris?
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
Some people are just born unhappy.
I'm sorry.
Are you buying an apartment?
What?
No.
No, no.
I'm friends with the architect.
Are you?
No.
No, I'm here with...
Joel Kotkin, the city councilman.
I work for him as sort of a personal assistant.
- I'm Anne.
Anne Morris.
- Very nice to meet you, Anne.
- And listen, about your sister...
- It's okay.
You couldn't have saved her.
Her mood disorder kind of runs in the family, unfortunately, so...
Well, you're not thinking of doing something stupid, are you, Anne?
Me?
You mean like falling for the wrong man?
Well, I do that all the time.
Everything's all right!
Come on.
Keep partying.
What are you doing?
- Phil, I should've guessed.
- Hey, Vince.
What's up?
- How are you?
Thanks for comin'.
- I'm sorry about this.
She slipped.
No worries.
As long as you're okay.
You all right?
She's fine.
Let me introduce you to a... colleague who works with me up the office.
And this one works with me down at the office.
- Or is it the other way around?
- Philip.
Oh, my big brother.
How you doin', man?
- Friends of Vicky's?
Bridesmaids?
- Come on, man.
I'm still single.
- What are you doing?
- It's not like I don't love my little Vicky.
I love her madly.
You know that.
All right?
It's not like I hate all the other women in the world.
All right.
Relax.
There's something I want to show you.
Let's go get Marty and Luke.
Chris.
Gentlemen, welcome to the loft.
Wow.
This is impressive, Vince.
Check out the view.
Then imagine this is our own private oasis right in the heart of downtown.
- What do you mean?
- A place where no one hassles you.
A place you can escape to any time you want.
- So this is your loft?
- No.
It's ours.
If you want it.
What?
Ours?
Think about it.
No messy hotel bills.
No questionable credit card activity.
This would be our secret place...
to steal away, discreetly and economically...
in these challenging times.
Five-way split.
What do you think?
I don't know.
I'm not like that.
Come on, Chris.
We're men.
We're all a little like that.
Yeah, tell me about it.
Give me your key right now.
Bring your twins up here,
- give 'em a little private tour.
- You know what they cost, Marty?
How much?
I might have it on me right now.
Seriously.
Think about it.
It's a great investment.
A once-in-a-lifetime golden opportunity.
- I can't stay here.
- Where are you going?
Luke!
You cannot freak out right now.
We have to stay together like we said.
All right.
Luke, you need to calm the fuck down.
No!
No!
It's over, Vincent!
It's all gonna come out!
It's not over.
Listen.
We're gonna find out what happened here and we're gonna fix it.
Okay?
Try Phil again.
This is Philip.
Please leave a message after the tone.
What if he doesn't show?
He could be out of the country by now.
He'll show.
We can't cover for him, Chris.
Not this time.
Guys?
Look at this.
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
You know Latin, Doctor?
- Excuse me?
- Latin.
Do you know Latin?
I took it premed, yeah.
What's it say on the wall there?
Fatum nos iungebit.
Yeah, I know.
Fatum nos iungebit.
I can read that.
What's it mean?
I'm guessing you already know what it means.
No.
We would like to hear you say it.
You'd like to hear me say it.
Okay.
Fatum nos iungebit.
Fate will unite us.
Now, all I can possibly think is that somebody who knows Latin like you reached over with this young lady's hand and wrote "Fatum nos iungebit" on the wall.
- Fatum nos iungebit is wrong.
- How so, Doctor?
The future imperfect tense of the verb unite, iungere... is not iungebit, it's iunget.
It should say "Fatum nos iunget."
So the person you're looking for made a classic Latin error.
But I'm guessing you knew that already too, didn't you?
You know the phrase "Fuck you"?
Germanic origin.
Where's your brother?
I'm sorry.
I can't help you with that one.
Actually, he's your half-brother, isn't he?
Same mother, different fathers.
He spent some time in various institutions with your half-sister Zoe?
Yeah, that's right.
After our mother died...
Philip wasn't...
wasn't as lucky with his father.
Apparently not.
Alcoholic child beater.
You didn't spend much time with Philip back then, did you?
- No.
- But now you're best friends.
We've had a lot of catching up to do.
You really don't know where we can find him?
Fate will unite us?
Where the hell's your brother, Chris?
I don't know.
What the hell is this?
- Where the fuck is Philip?
- I'm right here.
- What the hell's going on?
- You did this.
- You did this!
- Luke!
Luke, Luke, Luke!
- Come here!
Hey!
Hey!
- Hands off!
Come on.
Bring it on!
- Cool it.
- What is this?
Shit.
- Did you have anything to do with this?
- What the fuck you talkin' about?
Just answer the fucking question!
Did you do this?
- Of course not!
- Jesus Christ.
- Were you here last night?
- No, man, I wasn't here last night.
I slept at my in-laws.
You don't believe me, call Vicky.
What about this morning?
Were you here this morning?
I was at a project site, all right?
With my father-in-law.
My God.
Where were you last night?
- Where've you been?
- Philip, take it easy.
Before accusing everyone else, where have you been?
'Cause I never got a text saying the loft was taken.
Never.
- Last night, I was at home.
- Can you prove it?
No, I can't prove it 'cause Barbara's taken the kids skiing.
- You'll have to take my word for it.
- Your word?
There's a dead woman in our loft that only us have access to.
If anybody has anything to do with this, now's the time to say it, right now.
Philip's got a ball and chain now.
- Who would have thunk it?
- Who's the father-in-law again?
His name's Hiram Fry.
He's a huge property developer.
His friends call him "the man of steel."
Worth millions.
Think she's his only daughter.
- So what's not to love?
- I just hope Philip will be happy.
- Well, that's cozy.
- What?
Ever since Councilman Kotkin got elected, the man of steel's been busy rebuilding downtown.
- Kotkin came to your opening, right?
- Yeah, he turned up for a photo op.
When it comes to handing out permits and contracts though, the game's rigged.
Tell me what we're talking about again 'cause I just saw some mini cheesecakes.
Gorgeous?
I mean, this whole setup.
Whoever said money can't buy happiness sure hasn't lived this life.
Sorry, boys.
You lost your bachelor mascot.
He's all mine now.
Good luck with breaking this bronco, Vicky.
God knows others have tried.
- But I'm not others, am I, Philip?
- She told you!
And it's not just me.
Philip's married into the Fry family now.
Soon as we're back from Fiji.
Yeah.
Well, gonna sell some properties with Vicky's dad.
- You know, see how it grabs me.
- Grabs you.
Well, guys, thanks for coming.
- Congratulations.
- Come on.
I'll be with you in a second, baby.
I need a break from all the ass-kissing.
Shit.
- Where is Fiji?
- I don't know, man.
Phil?
Your wedding present.
- Are you for real?
- Absolutely.
Don't lose it.
There's only five of these in existence.
Accepting a key to the loft means you accept the rules to the loft.
Marty?
What, are you crazy?
Our wives are here.
Don't you think that's a bit cynical, handing those things out here?
Cynical?
It's just a key to a room.
You should check it out.
Oh, no, you're not like that.
Not now.
Maybe later.
What about you, Luke?
Now or later?
Come on.
- That-a-boy.
- Oh, wow.
You just make sure this doesn't blow up in your faces.
How's it gonna blow up in our face?
It's just a room, like Vince said.
Our room.
Now, we keep it to ourselves, all right?
Tell nobody.
It just stays within our circle.
Marty?
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
You just need to find someone willing to go with you, Marty.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, yeah.
I think there's plenty choices right here.
Some of these guys bring some premium-grade high-test pussy.
Like that little dewy-eyed vixen right there.
- She looks underage.
- No, she's 20.
And ne of you guys messes with her, I'm gonna crack your head wide open.
- What, do you got dibs on Miss Curly Locks?
- Listen, man.
That's Zoe, all right?
- Zoe?
- Yeah.
- Like as in skin-and-bones tomboy Zoe?
- Yeah.
I hate to say it, Phil, but your little sister's seriously hot.
- Thanks, man.
- She's not little anymore.
- That is the finest piece of ass...
- Marty, that's enough.
I'm just saying, I'd like to fuck her like an animal.
- Come on, Marty.
That's enough.
- Feel her from the inside.
I want to fuck you like an animal
You don't sing.
You don't laugh.
You don't talk about my sister.
Got it?
Got it?
- Don't fuck with me!
- You watch it.
You watch it.
Kick your ass at your own fucking wedding.
Hi.
Hi.
We met at the... the building opening.
That's right.
You're Anne Morris.
I'm glad you remember me, Chris.
I see you work weekends.
What a dedicated personal assistant.
What a lucky city councilman.
Screw him.
Do you?
Does it get a bit boring walking around all these parties by yourself?
He wants you close, but not too close.
Not when there's important people around.
I told you I fall for the wrong men.
Can you keep a secret?
Our city councilman likes to keep my panties with him at these events, in his pocket.
It's a turn-on for him... the thought of me in a crowd so naked.
Only he knows.
- Why do you let him use you like that?
- Who says he's using me?
Maybe it turns me on.
Maybe me telling you about it turns me on even more.
I hope you don't catch cold.
Chris.
Chris, I'm sorry...
I don't know.
Maybe I was testing you.
I don't need to be tested.
Listen, do you want to maybe get a cup of coffee... someplace quiet... private?
I'd like to use your key.
Just once.
It's not what you think.
Hey, it doesn't matter what I think.
Have fun.
- Does everyone still have a key?
- Course we do.
It's crucial we get this right.
Five keys were cut.
To make a sixth, you'd need the code, which is in my safe, so we can rule that out.
But there was no break-in.
So does everyone still have a key?
What, you think we've been givin' away our keys?
- It's against your rules, Vince.
- Then show me.
What are we trying to prove here?
Look, I don't know.
Maybe someone's lost a key, okay?
Let's just rule that out.
Okay?
Look.
Here's mine.
All right?
Chris?
You didn't use a key to get in just now.
- No.
I didn't bring it.
- Where is it?
I don't have it on me, okay?
It's not like I need it every day,
- like some of you guys.
- But you do still have it?
Vincent, whether or not I have my key on me right now is really not important.
It's extremely fucking' important.
Someone got in using a key, and yours is missing!
Is that right, Vincent?
Then how do you account for the fact that the alarm was shut off?
So let's just cut the bullshit, 'cause it definitely had to be one of us five.
Unless...
- Unless what?
- Unless she let him in.
Oh, yeah?
Then how'd she get in, Vincent?
Any way you look at it, it keeps coming back down to us.
And I, for one, would like to know who's hiding something.
I seriously don't believe it.
There's a word for that?
Yes.
Polyamory.
It's a philosophy, some sort of belief system about being romantically involved with more than one person at the same time.
And your boss gets away with that?
Yes.
He says that he's in love with his wife and his girlfriend, so why should he have to choose?
And his wife is amazingly cool with it.
Oh, really?
Is she special needs?
Maybe oxygen-deprived?
What?
- Explain.
I'd like to know.
- This sounds like my kinda philosophy.
Barbara, what's it called again?
Polly and Marie?
Please.
Spare us, Tubs.
You can barely handle one woman.
- What would you do with two?
- Bury one.
I would make up something, some sort of game that involves two ladies and one guy.
Start a trapeze act or somethin'.
Could you at least fake some enthusiasm?
It's your party.
Anyway, I'm cooking.
If you absolutely have to invite your friends over, could you at least try to make it home on time?
Look, they're never here, okay?
Will you just join us?
I just hope the pudgy clown doesn't puke on the rug.
He's been chugging vodka like it's Evian.
I mean, doesn't his wife see that?
Actually, she was just cool with it long enough to catch him in the act.
She hired a detective.
Cell phone records, credit card receipts.
Audio, video, the works.
And in a heartbeat, my poor boss went from polyamory to alimony.
Man, your boss sounds mentally retarded.
So, what... what happened to him?
He and his concubine are now cramped in a tiny one-bedroom condo.
But I'm guessing he's happy.
She's blonde, 23, with a brand-new pair of fake breasts.
How can men stand fake breasts?
Why are women always talking about "fake tits" this, "fake tits" that?
I mean, listen.
Girls, if it's a decent boob job, who fuckin' cares.
You know?
My mom...
My mom, she's got... false teeth.
Okay?
When she smiles, do people give her shit and say, "Oh, my God!
Look!
Fake!"
No, they don't.
They say, "Wow!
You look way better now.
It's an improvement."
You know, you women, you're so catty, so competitive.
Calm down, Tubby dearest.
You know what?
No, it's nothin' to be calm about, Mimi.
I mean, a glorious, big set of fuckin' tits... and a nice piece of ass, it's thrilling!
It's thrilling!
This is all a little too highbrow for my teeny, tiny, catty female mind.
Oh, well, you know what?
You should have that enlarged.
And while you're under, you should have the corners of your mouth lifted so you can smile every once in a while.
Sorry.
- Sorry, Chris.
What?
What?
- Marty.
Marty.
- Come on.
- No.
No, you're a class act, Marty.
Mimi, would you like to get your husband another drink or should I do the honors?
You should do it.
And I want it chilled.
- And then you go with her and stir.
- Honey?
The problem with your boss, Barbara, is he didn't have his shit together.
I mean, apart.
Apart, I mean.
He did...
No, I mean he didn't compartmentalize.
You guys agree?
All right, Marty.
How would you compartmentalize?
How?
Okay.
Well, since you ask.
First thing first is I wouldn't have a place that you could get caught.
Not a hotel, not your girlfriend's crib.
That's key, right?
Am I right, Vinnie boy?
- Am I right?
- Marty, you've lost us all.
I doubt that!
I doubt that, Vinnie boy.
But it...
Okay, first of all...
Sorry, baby.
I would just get a little... you know, a little one-bedroom condo... or something like that.
You all right?
Mimi, your husband tends to talk out of his ass when he's been drinking.
Yeah?
Hon, would you give me a hand?
Sure.
- Sorry.
Didn't know you were in here.
- Yeah, no problem.
Ate too much too fast, I guess.
Thai food, you know.
Yeah, it gets all up in your nose and shit.
- Yeah.
It's a little spicy.
- Yeah.
I'm outta here.
Bye.
- I need to pick up some more insulin.
- Luke?
Is there something you wanna tell me?
Are you keeping secrets?
What kind of secrets?
Is there someone else?
I don't know why you start asking me silly questions, but the answer is no.
- I'm not cheating on you, Ellie.
- That's not what I'm asking, Luke.
I'm asking if there's someone else.
Listen, sweetie.
Whatever I may be or may not be... and I know I'm not as glamorous as some... but I'll always be there for you and the children.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
I want you to know... there's a lot I could put up with.
- What are you doing?
- We need to get her out of here.
- How?
She is shackled to the bed!
- Can't you guys see what's going on?
- Someone is trying to frame us.
- Who?
Who wants to frame us?
I don't know.
But think about it.
The body's cuffed to the bed.
It's impossible to move.
The Latin, the knife.
Someone did this for a reason.
The cops could be here any second.
None of us know who this girl is.
We don't even know how she got in here.
Who else knew about the arrangement?
Who else knows about our arrangement?
Did anyone blab, tell one of the girls that have been up here?
- Marty?
- What?
Why me?
- Some night you were hammered?
- I've always followed the rules, Vincent.
Did you give anyone your code?
Did you key in while someone was watching?
Absolutely not.
I just told you.
Wait.
What's your point, Vincent?
Where are you going with this?
- Someone is trying to set us up.
- Like who?
I don't know.
A rejected girlfriend.
A jealous boyfriend.
Betrayed husband.
Someone with a motive.
Look.
Is one of you guys in some kind of trouble?
I think I may be falling in love with you.
You don't have to say that.
No, but I mean it.
Why would you say that, Chris?
Why would you even feel it?
I've never cheated on my wife before.
And I don't fall in love easily.
Chris, I don't want you to love me.
You don't even know me... apart from these stolen moments.
I mean, they're exciting, yeah, sure, but... they're just moments.
Let's change that.
I wanna see you more often and not just for this.
No, stop it.
I don't want you to love me.
Well, I don't wanna keep sneaking around.
- I'm gonna tell Alison about us.
- No, you're not.
Yes, I am.
Anne.
- I'm gonna leave her.
- Stop it!
Why are you doing this?
The people you love, they're the only ones who can hurt you.
- I would never hurt you, Anne.
- Stop.
Stop what?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Would you...
Stop it, okay?
You don't know me.
Okay?
That's the end of it.
- Would you give me a chance, at least...
- I'm a whore.
All right?
- What?
- I'm a prostitute.
I fuck men for money.
Do you get it now?
Don't worry, Doctor.
I won't bill you for the past few months.
Anne, would you wait?
Would you wait a minute?
Please stop it.
You don't know the half of it.
Just go home.
Go home to your wife and your kids.
Is your friend Chris Vanowen cheating on his wife, Mr. Landry?
Oh, I doubt that.
Chris is a very devoted husband and...
And a model dad, just like all the rest of your pals, right?
Except for you.
You're not exactly squeaky clean, are you, Marty?
I don't know what you mean.
- Why does your wife want a divorce?
- Divorce?
That's not right.
What we're going through is a separation.
It's a trial separation.
Why?
Because she found out something that she... wasn't too happy about.
- You fucked around on her.
- If you wanna be technical.
How'd she find out?
- The woman with whom I...
- Fucked around?
Yeah.
Apparently expected something a little more and she showed up on our front porch.
The bitch started to... the woman in question started saying things.
And my only hope is that Mimi will come around eventually, because I love her very much.
Did you go with this woman up to the loft?
What?
No.
This happened in San Diego.
Oh, that's where you met the woman, right?
In San Diego.
- Yeah.
- Why were you there?
A commercial real estate convention.
Vince had a couple extra tickets.
A VIP thing, you know.
It's... a couple nights in a fancy hotel and a chance to get away for a couple days.
And nights.
Yeah.
Nights too.
Man, do you see that?
Jesus, Vince.
Those girls are drooling all over you.
Invite 'em over.
You got first dibs.
I'm happy with second best too.
He's cute.
See him?
I'll take a rain check on that.
What?
What, are you fucking crazy?
Why wouldn't you invite them over?
'Cause, Marty, I'd rather dive for some rare and exotic sea creature than shoot fish in a barrel.
Does Barbara know about these deep-sea expeditions of yours?
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah.
What's your problem, Seacord?
You got a key to the loft.
What do you do up there, your laundry?
Dishes?
Hey, are you guys here on business or what?
I'm Dana.
My first time here.
It's a little overpriced for what you get, don't you think?
Hi, Dana.
I'm Vincent.
This is Marty, Luke.
Can we... buy you a drink?
Hey, when I said "overpriced," I wasn't trolling for free booze.
- No, I mean, I didn't think...
- Since you asked, what are you drinking?
Oh, champagne?
A girl can dream.
- Champagne?
- Please.
All right.
One champagne coming up.
What are you doing?
The fat chick's gonna scare off all the hot chicks.
Marty.
Every fat chick has a good-looking friend.
Hers is probably on her way down right now.
Okay.
Yeah, well, what if she is the good-looking friend... and the really fat chick's on her way down?
I think that's Philip's father-in-law.
- Yeah, it is.
- I'll be.
That's the man of steel, all right.
But that ain't Mrs. Steel.
- Think we should give him a key?
- Maybe.
Not mine.
I'd like a bottle of your finest champagne and four glasses, please, at the table in the corner.
You... were at my daughter's wedding.
Philip's friends.
You're the architect.
- Vincent Stevens.
- We should talk sometime, Mr. Stevens.
Sure.
What do you got in mind, Mr. Fry?
We have a new waterfront project.
It's massive.
It's cutting-edge.
It might be right up your alley.
Of course, it's all preliminary, and we have to keep it under wraps.
I hope you can be discreet.
Sure.
Discretion, Mr. Stevens.
That's the main thing.
Dictum sapienti sat est.
A word to the wise.
You are wise?
Yeah, sure.
Wise...
wise and discreet, Mr. Fry.
I'm in software.
I can be discreet myself, and wise.
I'll pick up their tab as well.
Have a nice evening, gentlemen.
Fantastic.
Oh, they're right over here.
Sweetheart?
- Sweetheart?
- Excuse me.
Hi, this is Anne.
Leave a message.
Who are you calling at this hour?
I wasn't.
I was just checkin' my voice mail.
And what does your voice mail say?
That you're a lousy liar, Chris Vanowen?
What are you talk...
Is something wrong?
You tell me, Chris.
- Alison, I...
- I'm going to bed.
Alison!
Excuse me.
That's not thinking.
It's called following your dick around.
Okay, two kinds of articles in Cosmo month after month...
One: men are pigs.
Two:
How do I seduce a pig to chop my wood?
I don't read Cosmo month after month.
- Well, I do.
- I don't.
- Well, I do.
- And I find it strangely compelling.
- You know what I find strangely compelling?
- What?
Your eyebrows.
Lumberjack contest.
I can't leave you alone for a minute.
Sarah.
It's been more like an hour.
Thank God I've been subsidized.
Aren't you going to introduce me to your new friends?
And that was the first time you met her?
Yeah, that was...
- That was the first time.
- Sarah?
Yeah.
Her name was Sarah.
Mr. Stevens, what else happened in San Diego?
- What do you want to know?
- Everything.
- I got another one!
- No!
No!
Keep it down.
Keep it down.
- This is insane, Sarah.
- You should never dare a crazy woman.
- Vincent, we should probably go back.
- Luke, lighten up.
It's okay.
Said I'd get you to the pool.
Now you have to keep your end of the bargain.
- Come over here.
Sit down.
- Yeah.
Come on.
Don't keep us waiting.
Take it off.
- I'm gonna be sick.
- What?
Vince's body's not that bad.
- Not Vince, the shrimp cocktail!
- What?
Dana!
Dana!
Come...
Come back.
Come back here!
- Your turn.
- No.
Take it all off.
Not bad.
Is this still too scary for you, Luke?
Are you gonna join us?
I'm...
I'm fine right here.
But I need you, 'cause Vincent's gonna try and make a move on me soon.
And if you're here, maybe he won't dare.
Well, maybe Vincent's not interested.
Maybe Vincent would rather do laps.
That would explain the last few hours of casual-but-meaningful glances that each lasted a second too long.
You like to play games?
I do.
And I'll tell you something else:
I'm better at it than you.
- Can you feel me?
- Most definitely.
Marty?
- Marty, I need my room key.
- Dude!
I'm kinda busy here.
- Don't stop!
- Go!
- I'm not stopping.
- Just do it!
You're scared, is what it is.
You're running away from your feelings.
I don't want to say good-bye.
Do you have any idea what it's like to really love someone?
I'm sorry.
What are you doing?
Throwing it away.
It's empty.
You were here yesterday, weren't you?
Guys?
We gotta go to the cops.
We're not getting anywhere with this.
First, I think Vincent has something to tell you.
All right, let's hear it.
What the hell?
- Hello?
- Who is it?
Who is it?
It's a Realtor who wants to come up.
Somebody listed the loft for sale?
- What?
- Oh, Jesus fucking...
Listed the loft?
She said she has an appointment with a Deakins, Sarah Deakins.
Who...
Who's Sarah Deakins?
Wait.
Who the hell is trying to sell our loft?
You know her, Marty.
- What?
- You know her, and so does Luke.
Sarah Deakins is lying on the bed.
You guys, I promise, I've never seen a Sarah Deakins.
- That's not true.
You know her.
- Why do you keep saying that?
You met her in San Diego the last night in the bar.
Remember?
Dana's friend.
The last night?
I was wasted outta my mind.
The whole night's a blur.
Jesus!
- Luke, you remember her, don't you?
- That's Sarah?
You remember Sarah.
You remember her, right?
Yes.
I remember Sarah.
But how was I supposed to know that's Sarah?
Come on, guys.
What the hell's going on?
You guys turned her over and looked at her face.
I did not.
Yeah.
I think there's been a mistake.
We don't know anyone named Sarah Deakins.
Marty.
Come on!
- Who is it?
Do we know her?
- I don't know.
Fuck.
So is that all you wanted to tell us, Vince?
Or is there more?
I had a thing with her.
I brought her up here a couple of times.
I swear on my kids, I had nothing to do with this.
Would you just fuckin' tell me?
Were you here with her last night?
Were you the one who let her in?
I broke up with her last night.
I swear she was alive when I left.
It still doesn't explain why someone listed the loft!
Something special or just browsing?
Why don't you return my phone calls?
- If you're dumping me, at least have...
- Chris, how can I dump you?
There's nothing between us.
So that's what it meant to you?
Nothing?
Did you forget what I told you already?
Who I am, what I do?
No.
I haven't.
It doesn't change how I feel about you.
How many women have you taken to that fuck pad you share with your four little buddies?
- What?
- Please, Chris.
Save it for some girl who'll actually buy your bullshit.
Anne, no, wait.
Wait.
You know I'm not like that.
Here.
I only need this if I'm with you, so you keep it.
If you wanna see me again, you let me know.
Chris?
What are you doing here?
Shopping for Alison?
No.
No, I was just here with a colleague.
Does your wife know you've been sharing the loft with your pals?
I already told you, I'm not sharing a loft with any pals.
I was there just once, at a party, when the building first opened.
Then you have been there.
A minute ago, you didn't even know where the building was.
I never took anyone up there.
I thought that's what you meant.
Well, did you know the girl?
We met once in San Diego.
Are you aware that Mr. Stevens began a relationship with her in San Diego?
- That would surprise me, frankly.
- You didn't know?
Isn't Vincent Stevens your best friend?
It's so obvious what you're trying to do here.
You're trying to turn us against each other.
But guess what?
I'm not about to start trashing my friend.
Is it possible, Mr. Seacord, that you are jealous of your best friend... when he's nailing all these beautiful women?
I am a married man.
I'm not interested in nailing women.
I'm not jealous of Vincent.
Oh, no.
I didn't mean jealous of him, Mr. Seacord.
I meant jealous of the women.
Where do you get off with an innuendo like that?
- Fucking bastards.
- Why are you so angry, Mr. Seacord?
Vincent is my closest friend.
And he has been for years.
Yeah, fine.
But your best friend is selling you out as we speak, Mr. Seacord.
You and the rest of your gang.
No.
Vincent would never sell out his friends.
You're full of shit, asshole.
- What'd you call me?
- You heard me, you lying piece of shit!
I broke up with her and I left!
That's it!
Yeah?
- After you cut her up with this.
Right?
- Put the knife down!
- I didn't kill her.
- Back off.
- Put the knife...
Put the knife down!
- Back off.
The loft was listed in her name.
That's not a coincidence.
- Someone's trying to pin this on us.
- On you, you mean.
Jesus!
Get a fuckin' grip!
Fuck!
Guys, we cannot keep doing this.
Well, what do you wanna do, Marty?
Just leave me hanging?
Hey, Vince?
Vince?
Are you in there?
If you're in there, hey, man, I need to talk to you for just a second.
Christ, Marty, I've got company.
Didn't you get my text?
Mimi's gone.
- She's gone.
Fucking gone.
- What do you mean "gone"?
Gone where?
She left me.
She found out about San Diego.
That dumpy chick, she showed up and then told her everything.
Fuck!
Wait a minute.
You didn't tell Mimi about the loft?
What?
It's not about the goddamn loft, Vince!
It's about my wife!
I don't know what I'm gonna do without her!
Did you...
Did you confess?
Then never confess, Marty.
Never confess.
Would you go to her and just...
just tell her that I love her?
You know?
And that Dana's lying?
She'll believe you.
Marty, I will straighten this out for you.
I promise you I will straighten this out.
- Okay.
- Hey, come here.
It's okay.
Thanks.
Okay, so what's the plan?
What do we do now?
We get her out of here.
- We can't just make a body disappear.
- That's too bad.
It's our only hope.
You had a relationship with her.
Now she's some inconvenient piece of evidence?
- What kind of man are you?
- That's a laugh, coming from you.
And how do you plan to get her off the bed?
Cut off her hand?
Or do you have the key to those cuffs?
You know what?
I thought handcuffs were more your thing than mine, Phil.
- Meaning what?
- You know exactly what I mean.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Just keep your fuckin' mouth shut!
All right?
Please help... help me!
Please help me!
Keep that fucking mouth shut!
He's crazy!
This fucking whore's trying to rip me off!
- Please help me!
He raped me!
- Shut up!
- Hey.
Hey.
Easy, easy!
- What?
- All right.
All right.
- It's gonna be okay.
He's crazy!
Shit.
Okay, okay.
- Philip, give me the keys.
- Bitch is gonna go to the cops, man.
- The keys to the handcuffs.
- She's gonna go to the cops!
Keys!
You want the key?
- Shit.
- He made me do things I didn't want to do.
- Shut up!
Shut up!
- Easy.
Easy.
What?
You want more money?
That's it, right?
It's all about the money?
It's all about the fucking money!
Here's your fucking money!
It's right there!
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck is the matter with you?
- Have you lost your fucking mind?
- She's a whore, Chris!
- Do you know what a whore is?
- Shut up!
- You can't rape a whore!
- Shut up!
- You can't rape a...
- Shut up!
You don't treat a woman like that!
You got it?
Not any woman!
- Don't fuckin' touch me!
- What the fuck's the matter with you?
You're putting us all at risk!
I want police.
He...
He hit me.
Shut...
- He raped me!
- Shut up!
Stop screaming, or I'm gonna rip your goddamn throat out!
I've had it with you.
You're no better than your father.
- I'm what?
- You heard me.
Oh, right, Chris.
That's a nice one.
Chris had a better deal with his daddy, right?
The great guy who wants to save everyone.
Where were you... when Zoe and I were getting beat up?
And Mom in the next room pretending not to hear.
Where were you?
In your cozy college dorm getting laid and wasted
- 'cause you didn't give a fuck!
- I didn't know anything about it.
You didn't give a crap!
All those years we didn't exist for you!
I didn't know anything about it!
If you would've told me or said something...
Then what, you phony?
Then what?
Then I would've gotten you out of there, goddamn it!
Both of you!
Listen.
I'm really, really sorry, but we can't go to the cops.
Here's what I'm gonna do.
I have a friend.
He's a doctor.
- No.
- Yes.
I'm gonna drive you to him.
He's gonna take care of you.
Okay?
- No!
- Here.
Listen.
Take it.
I know it's not enough for what happened tonight, but...
He's an animal.
He should be locked up!
And we're gonna deal with him, I promise you.
Come on.
Get your clothes.
I'm gonna take you to the doctor.
- No!
- Easy.
Here we go.
No.
I'll never forgive you for this.
Never!
What's the problem?
Jesus Christ!
Why don't I know anything about this?
- And when did it happen?
- A couple of weeks ago.
We decided to keep it to ourselves 'cause that's the kind of friends we are.
Don't lecture me, all right?
Especially about friendship.
Yeah, yeah, right.
Sorry.
I meant to give you the cokehead rapist lecture.
Fuck you.
You can see how I think you'd be involved in this.
I need to say something.
Oh, shit.
You had that coming!
- Hey, come on!
Get up!
- Relax.
Take it easy.
You son of a bitch.
You recorded everything that went on here.
Every woman...
Not every.
Not always.
Just... sometimes.
- At least I don't cheat on my wife.
- No, you just watch us and beat off.
- You sick fuck.
- You're a sick fuck!
Luke, did you record last night?
No.
You didn't say you were coming, which is against your rules.
And that wasn't the first time you broke your own rules, by the way.
Now you're scared, aren't you?
Now you know I've documented pretty much everything you've been up to here.
No worries, Vincent.
I'll keep my mouth shut, like I always do.
Did you see anything that can help us out here?
Anything at all?
If all the people who've been hurt and cheated on find out the truth, what do you think'll happen, Vincent?
What's the matter?
- I just don't feel like leaving tomorrow.
- Serious?
You love skiing.
Yes, I love to ski, but just not by myself.
Are you sure you can't come?
Babe, you know I can't come.
I can't just take off right now.
Hey.
I'll call you every day.
I love you.
- I know the drill.
One hour, right?
- Wrong.
Have a blast.
Don't mind me.
Why should tonight be any different from the past few months?
Alison, if it's all right with you, I'd rather not spoil tonight.
I'm sure it must be tempting to grab something shiny and new.
But do you ever think about what you might stand to lose, Chris?
You could ruin a lot more than just this evening.
Tell me.
Are you so happy, Alison?
Well, what do you know?
If it's for charity, my mother-in-law is allowed to join the party for a little while.
Heard anything about the waterfront project?
No.
He's gonna call once he gets his permits.
Now, as far as I know, everything's approved.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Ladies, you look absolutely ravishing tonight.
- Thank you.
- This is Vincent Stevens.
He's the architect who designed the new loft building near the sports arena.
Oh, wonderful.
I love that building.
Why, thank you, Mrs. Kotkin.
I really appreciate that.
As I was saying to your husband in San Diego, gentlemen in our business can't afford to be exposed to the negative consequences of bad design.
Speaking of...
San Diego, how's that waterfront project coming along?
Yes.
We're still working on it.
We've applied for all our permits and now we're waiting.
Standing in line like everyone else.
You don't strike me as the type of man that stands in line, Mr. Fry.
What about you, Mr. Kotkin?
Are you a gambling man?
And you, Mr. Stevens?
You like to take chances?
As a matter of fact, I do.
Especially when I'm holding a handful of hearts.
Anyway, I don't mean to interrupt.
Ladies, if you're as lucky on the tables tonight as you are in love, then I am sure you'll hit your jackpots.
Gentlemen, always a pleasure.
Blackjack!
- Set aside enough for the "ali-money."
- Mimi, what are you doin' here?
Just 'cause I booted you out doesn't mean I'm stuck at home.
I want to come back.
I know I screwed up once.
Once.
But I was drunk off my ass.
I swear it didn't mean a damn thing.
Something I don't understand about men.
If it doesn't mean anything, why bother?
- I promise I'll change.
- Into what?
A frog?
Certainly not a prince.
How about the ass you already are?
What if I told you I wanted to fuck around tonight?
Sorry.
It would hurt like hell, wouldn't it?
Hey, maybe I already got even.
Maybe with one of your pals.
Maybe Chris.
He's cute.
Or how about Vincent?
The night you sent him over for that tragic heart-to-heart.
"Marty's really suffering, man.
Mimi, you've gotta talk to him."
Blackjack!
Well, look at that, Tubs.
Your first-ever winning streak.
Just remember, dear heart...
half of it is mine.
I love you!
- You gave Zoe a ticket for tonight?
- Philip, let go.
I keep her away from bullshit like this, and then behind my back...
Christ, Phil, she's almost 20 years old.
What are you, her father?
Did you see her?
She looks like a whore.
- I thought you like whores.
- Yeah.
Let her have some fun.
If you'll excuse me
I'm about to have some fun too.
I'm kind of on a roll.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.
I hope you win big-time.
You'll need it with all the shit you've been packin' up your nostrils.
So you noticed a tiny fraction of your stash went missing?
If you don't like it, file for a divorce.
I haven't ruled that out.
Don't forget about our prenup, loser.
While you're at it go play some blackjack.
Could be your last best chance at paying the rent.
Can I get some dice over here?
- Hands off.
- Excuse me.
Anne?
Anne?
We need to talk.
Yeah?
About what?
Your pal the architect.
He's playing with fire.
I'd actually rather talk about Anne.
I'll pass along your message to Vincent, but I'd like something too, Mr. Kotkin.
I'd like for you to stop seeing Anne.
- And why would I do that?
- Because I love her.
Then we have more in common than we thought.
I'd like you to stop paying her.
I want you to let her go.
That's really not up to me.
Fact is, it's totally her choice.
Except I never paid for her.
Well, that's true.
You never paid.
Stop it, Joel.
I'm going.
What did he mean by that...
"You never paid"?
- I don't want to love you, Chris.
- Someone's paying you to be with me?
- You're the only one who can hurt me.
- Anne?
Tell me it's a lie.
The first time, it was paid for.
Every other time, that was real, that was me.
- But who paid?
- I can't...
- Excuse me.
Come on, Zoe, let's go.
- I'm fine here.
- I'm asking you to come with me.
- And I'm asking you to stop.
- Did you not hear the lady?
- Mind your business.
- Stop!
- What are you deaf or just a dick?
I don't know, man.
What does it say up here?
"Deaf" or "dick"?
Help me out.
Stop!
Leave him alone!
Don't!
Don't!
Fuck!
Come on!
Excuse me.
Thank you.
Excuse me.
- Shut up!
- Somebody get this guy an ambulance.
I never want to see you again.
Not in my home and not near my daughter.
Do you got that?
Get him the hell out of here.
Okay, folks!
Let's get back to the gaming tables, shall we?
Hey.
It's okay.
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, it's okay.
- It's not what you're thinking.
- And what am I thinking?
She's my friend's sister.
Okay?
Are there more besides me, her and your wife?
What's the grand total?
Look, I can't have this conversation here.
Barbara's standing right over there.
- Do you love me?
- Of course I love you.
- I'm crazy about you.
- But would you choose me if you could?
You know it's not that simple.
Come meet me in the loft tomorrow, okay, and we'll talk it through.
You're right.
It's not that simple.
- But maybe I can make it simple.
- What do you mean?
Maybe I can help you make that choice.
Sarah.
Sarah.
Sarah.
Sarah.
I'm sorry.
Are you all right?
Don't do it, Sarah.
You'll regret it.
They found out.
Our wives, they... they set us up.
Why, Vincent?
They...
They found out.
They found out about the loft.
Why would you do it, Vincent?
We're your friends.
- No.
- Why did you do it?
No.
It was... our wives.
They...
They found out.
No, it's your friends.
We found out.
- What's going on?
- You still don't get it.
- All right, strip him.
- What are you doing?
- You are a total fucking psychopath.
- I did what you told me.
- I didn't tell you to fucking cut her open!
- That wasn't a part of the plan.
And the Latin on the bed?
Like the cops are gonna believe that bullshit.
- Then you should've done it yourself.
- Come on.
Let's do this.
- What'd you give me?
- What you deserve.
You...
You killed Sarah?
- No.
We just found her.
- What?
We were here this morning, Vincent, before you arrived.
No.
Jesus Christ.
At first I thought she was sleeping.
And Vincent knows her?
She...
She left him this.
"See you in the next life."
Why did she have to do it here?
We gotta call the cops.
They investigate suicides.
This is all gonna come out.
Guys, wait.
Can't we find out where she lives and... and leave her there?
- Jesus.
- Philip.
- Come on, we have to help out Vince.
- Yes.
Speaking of which, where the fuck is Vince?
Isn't this his problem?
Vincent isn't here because...
because I didn't call him.
You didn't call him?
Why didn't you call him?
There's something I have to show you.
You've been taping us?
You fucking pervert!
You can beat the crap out of me later.
We don't have much time, and you need to watch this.
Maybe you'll get a new perspective on what happened upstairs.
Maybe you'll agree we shouldn't take the hit for Vincent's fuckup.
You see, Vincent...
Vincent hasn't always been a good friend.
No.
Oh, God!
Hey, maybe I already got even.
Or maybe Vincent, the night you sent him over for that tragic heart-to-heart.
They got here late, the night he went to talk to her.
She was drunk, Marty.
He took advantage.
Wow.
Your little sister's seriously hot.
Hey.
- How long has it been...
- Doesn't matter.
How long?
He started seeing her right after your wedding.
They met here on a regular basis.
If I'm not mistaken, he was her first.
Fuck!
Gorgeous?
The people you love, they're the only ones who can hurt you.
He paid Anne... to let you seduce her, put the hook in so you'd want a share of the loft.
The first time, it was paid for.
Have fun.
Chris, please.
You don't know the half of it.
All right?
Just go home.
He used her, Chris.
Just like he used everyone.
Everyone.
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.
Vincent can't sense anything is up when he walks in.
We have to try and remain calm.
We're gonna get questioned by the cops.
That's why we can never admit we're sharing this loft.
They'll try to turn us against each other.
Okay.
I think this can work as long as we follow the plan.
Chris?
Okay.
I'm in.
But only if we know for sure that Vincent was here last night.
I wanna hear him say it.
And if he does, I'll go through with it.
I'll give a signal...
break something, a glass.
But nothing happens until we know for sure.
Understood?
We've got just under two hours to set everything up and establish alibis.
I'll take care of it.
You guys get out of here.
Make sure people see you.
- You have the suicide note, right?
- I've got it.
You knew what that prick was up to and you never said anything.
You're just as sick as Vincent.
They met here on a regular basis.
Vincent hasn't always been a good friend.
He started seeing her right after your wedding.
If I'm not mistaken, he was her first.
You are a total fucking psychopath.
- I did what you told me.
- I didn't tell you to fucking cut her open!
That wasn't a part of the plan.
And the Latin on the bed?
Like the cops are gonna believe that bullshit.
What happened here?
You're framing me!
Swallow it.
Swallow.
Swallow.
My own friends.
My own friends!
- Am I gonna die?
- No, Vincent, you're not gonna die.
Sarah lured you here and drugged you.
Then she killed herself, with you by her side. "Fate will unite us."
But you're gonna survive.
'Cause we're friends, aren't we?
So, you see, it was a setup.
Sarah and I were set up.
The whole thing was staged.
Still sounds a little unbelievable.
Don't you think?
- Unbelievable?
But it's the truth.
- Yeah.
My line of work, you gotta prove the truth, and you prove it with facts and findings.
Fact is, we only found your prints and those of Sarah Deakins.
Yeah, because they wiped the place clean.
And we have the DVDs of all your sexual exploits with your prints all over them.
Luke made those DVDs.
I never even saw 'em, let alone touched 'em.
Yeah, but we got no DVDs of your friends.
No DVDs of Marty's wife.
No DVDs of Philip's sister.
No DVDs of Chris's girlfriend.
All right?
Facts and findings, Mr. Stevens.
And we got no evidence that you were being set up.
All right.
Is there anything we've forgotten?
Yeah.
To follow the fuckin' plan.
Why didn't you just handcuff her?
- She was already dead.
- That's still no reason to mutilate her.
She killed herself!
I just made it more dramatic.
Yeah, well, you better hope your dramatics don't put us in jail.
Look, just...
lean on 'em a little bit.
Marty will break.
Maybe Luke too.
Look, don't tell me how to do my work.
We've questioned them all.
I got no reason to believe they've been lying.
- Plus, all your friends have alibis.
- Alibis?
Not for this morning, they don't.
We got Luke Seacord and Chris Vanowen together at breakfast.
We got Marty Landry at his office.
All right?
At his office?
Look, for at least an hour this morning, we were all in the loft.
So was Phil.
What about Phil?
Actually, he's downstairs right now with his father-in-law.
Fry?
What the fuck's Fry doing here?
He just gave a statement saying that he was with his son-in-law all day.
That is bullshit!
That is a false statement!
And why would he lie?
Hiram Fry brings a lot of credibility.
Credibili...
I saw Fry in San Diego with some bimbo!
Okay?
Phil knew that.
He knew I pressured Fry into giving me a waterfront contract.
So you tried to blackmail Hiram Fry?
Mr. Stevens, enough of this crap.
We got your prints all over the DVDs.
We got 'em all over the knife.
We got you chained next to the dead girl on the bed.
All right?
Call your lawyer, make a confession and save your ass!
You're free to go.
I want to thank you for your cooperation.
You understand we had to check out your friend's story.
Of course.
It's your job.
There's just... one thing that's bothering me.
Why does Vincent Stevens keep accusing his best friends?
I...
I don't know.
It bothers me too.
Could it be...
I just...
I just wonder...
Do you think he's trying to hide something else?
- What would he be hiding?
- Sarah Deakins's murder.
Murder?
But the detective in the interrogation called it a suicide.
Well, that's what it looked like.
But the autopsy report revealed that sleeping pills didn't kill her.
And her wrist was cut, but not by Sarah.
Hesitation marks, those tentative attempts... the first ones before a suicide actually slashes through an artery...
The coroner didn't find those on her.
- But Vincent, he... he would never...
- His prints are on the knife.
We didn't find a suicide note.
Is there something wrong?
We didn't find a suicide note.
- You have the suicide note, right?
- I've got it.
Luke.
Chris.
You scared me.
- You sure it's smart meeting here?
- I think we have a problem, Luke.
- How so?
- Where's Sarah's suicide note?
You put it in your pocket.
Yeah, I could've sworn I did, but it's not there anymore.
So when did you steal it from my coat?
When the doorbell rang this morning?
Surprise visit from the Realtor?
Chris, it's... it's unfortunate that you lost Sarah's suicide note, but...
I had nothing to do with that.
I called the agency to ask who put our loft up for sale.
All they could give me was a number.
I did call them.
I wanted...
I thought maybe that...
It's over, Chris.
We pulled it off.
We've got nothing to worry about now.
But why'd that note disappear?
The only real proof of her suicide.
Hello?
She says she's got an appointment with someone named Sarah Deakins.
Who's Sarah Deakins?
Is it because maybe she didn't write it?
Maybe it's your handwriting.
Vincent fucked us all.
You saw.
Yeah, I saw.
All the DVDs that made everybody crazy went right along with your grand plan, didn't it?
But why, Luke?
What'd you do to that girl?
Did she get in your way, between you and Vincent?
Actually, it was Vincent... standing between us.
Is there someone else?
I'm not cheating on you, Ellie.
Sarah, wait!
Forget Vincent.
He is better at games than you.
Always was, always will be.
He's hurting you.
- Using you.
- Why are you telling me this?
I'm telling you because...
because I'd never hurt you.
If you'd just give me the chance... to show I'd never hurt you.
That's right.
You'd never hurt me, because I feel nothing for you, Luke.
I'm sorry.
Maybe in another life.
You were here last night.
Barbara was off skiing.
So I figured I'd find Vincent here, with Sarah.
I'm sorry.
I waited till he left.
She said I was right about Vincent.
Consoling.
I've gotten so good at it.
I gave her an insulin OD.
It's... quick, painless... leaves no trace.
Jesus, Luke.
I did it out of love.
I swear.
And Vincent taking the fall for this...
That's okay with you?
Vincent used everyone and anyone!
It's about time we turned the tables!
Well, he's being charged with murder.
Yeah.
Sarah wasn't dead when we left her with Philip.
No.
No, you're lying.
No.
That's not possible.
What Philip did to her... was sick!
You're sick, Luke.
But if I'm hearing you right, it was your brother who killed Sarah.
Okay, Chris.
Go home.
I'll clean up.
Like always.
No.
No more cleaning up, Luke.
- Step outside.
- No, Luke.
Now.
Jesus.
Let me help you, Luke.
Please!
- You're gonna kill me too?
- It's your own fault.
- What do you want me to do?
Jump?
- Yes.
If you don't mind.
Luke, you don't need to do this.
Jesus Christ, Luke!
Would you stop it!
I don't want to hurt you, Chris.
I really don't.
So just do it.
Now!
I called the cops before I came.
I told 'em everything.
- Bullshit.
I know you better.
- I thought I knew you.
What about the note?
You want this to go down with me too?
Give me that note, Chris.
Give it to me!
It's over, Luke.
You're right.
It is over.
Tell Ellie and the kids...
I'm sorry.
Would you do that for me, Chris?
- No.
- Come on, Chris.
Be a friend.
Luke?
Luke.
Luke!
Luke!
- They're married.
- Honey, no.
They're having an affair.
Why?
Because she's laughing at his jokes?
No.
I'm telling you, they're having an affair.
Since when are you the big expert on affairs?
Really?
- Thanks for taking me back, Meems.
- What was my alternative?
To leave you wailing at the front door, with snot pouring out of your nose?
Sorry.
Didn't mean to scare you off.
I have the kids early tomorrow, so I gotta go.
You're gonna leave me here alone with my wife?
- Yes.
- We could at least have one more drink.
There'll be plenty more drinks.
- Good night, Meems.
- Good night, Chris.
Chris.
- Anne.
- Hi.
Hi.
- You look good.
- Thank you.
You too.
Listen, I still have the key.
Do you want it back?
It wouldn't work anymore.
Vincent's living there alone now.
It's the only thing his wife let him keep.
- And...
And Philip?
- He's awaiting trial, so... we'll see.
And you?
Are you doing okay?
- Yeah.
Most of the time.
- And the rest of the time?
I heard you ditched the city councilman.
That's not all I've given up.
Do you wanna grab a cup of coffee, or...
I swear to God, I had nothing to do with this.
We would love to believe you, Mr. Stevens, but you have to admit, your version of events does sound pretty bizarre, don't you think?
Look, it was a setup, OK?
The whole thing was staged.
So you were afraid?
That's your claim.
You were the victim?
Well, I mean, you know, not... not like...
Not like who?
Not like her?
Please, just talk to the others guys.
Have you talked to the others there?
We're doing our jobs.
So, why don't you just do yourself a favor and confess?
You know, save some time, save some legal fees.
Come on.
Why don't you take us through the events of this morning?
- Again?
- Again, Mr. Stevens.
Where were you this morning, Mr. Stevens?
I was at home.
Alone.
My wife's taking the kids skiing.
Yeah, sure, your wife's on her way back, as we speak.
And apparently, she has, uh, quite a few questions, of her own.
So, the phone woke you around what time this morning?
I don't know, uh, 9-9:30.
It-it was Luke in a panic.
He said I had to come.
- Where were you supposed to go?
- To the loft.
He told me to come to the loft.
Did he say why he was panicking?
- No.
- Well, did you know why he was panicking?
No, not yet.
Luke.
Luke?
Oh, my God!
Oh, fuck!
- What the hell happened?
- I don't know.
What do you mean, you just... were you...
I walked, in she was...
lying there...
Oh, fuck!
- Have you called the others?
- Chris and Marty are on their way.
- I-I still haven't reached Philip.
- OK, well, uh...
- keep calling, we need everybody here.
- Do you know who she is?
- Vincent, do you know who's lying there?
- What?
No, of-of course not.
Well, how the fuck did they get in?
What was it, a w-window, a door?
Windows are sealed and the door was locked.
The alarm was turned off.
That's impossible.
I'm telling you, the door was locked and the alarm was turned off.
- But that'd mean that...
- That someone got in... with one of our keys.
Do you know the loft building at the corner of Second and South Hope, Mr. Seacord?
No.
You know, the new residential one, down by the sports arena?
Designed, I believe, by your good friend, Vincent Stevens.
Vincent runs a very large firm.
He's done a lot of buildings.
There's a loft on the ninth floor, Mr. Seacord.
Have you ever been there?
No.
Strange, because according to our information, you and four friends are sharing this loft secretly, without your wives' knowledge.
- That is ridiculous.
- Don't the five of you bring women up there?
Girlfriends, mistresses, one night stands, catch of the day?
Five pals, just looking for privacy and fun, without the hassle of Visa statements and hotel bills, the Mrs. might find.
That is preposterous.
Maybe, Mr. Seacord, but one of your friends already made a full confession.
- You wanna know who?
- Listen...
I don't do things like that, you know, fool around with other women, I...
- You love your wife.
- I love my wife, yes.
What happened to your face, Mr. Seacord?
- I walked into a door.
- Or were you in a fight?
- I said I walked into a door.
- Where were you this morning?
Out with Chris, having breakfast.
There'd be a lot of people at the restaurant to verify that.
By Chris, you mean Dr. Chris Vanowen, the psychiatrist?
That's right.
One of your loft buddies?
Chris is married.
He's got two kids and, uh... he's not a guy that cheats on his wife, either.
I got a serious fucking problem, Chris.
Oh, shit!
- Philip.
- Philip?
What, you think your brother has something to do this?
No.
We gotta call the cops.
You realize what'll happen, if we call the cops?
Think about our wives.
It's a dead woman here, Vincent.
Why do we think Phillip is involved?
- Look, Chris, you know what he's capable of.
- Yeah, I know.
Maybe we can help him, OK?
If we can just figure out what the fuck happened, then maybe we can...
Then what, we gonna dump the body somewhere?
Look, I don't fucking know, but I'm not taking the fall for this.
- Marty...
- Son of a bitch!
Have you seen Phil?
Do you know where he is?
Was he here last night?
This can't be real.
- Wait, what are you doing?
- I wanna see her.
Put her back.
- Goddammit.
- Who is she?
I don't know.
Look.
None of us has anything to do with this, right?
Right?
We're gonna find out what happened here and we'll figure a way out.
We're in this together, we'll get out of it together, OK?
Because we're friends.
Agreed?
Agreed?
Well, looks like they'll let anybody in, right?
.
Congratulations, Vince.
This one's really spectacular.
Very special.
I appreciate that.
- Allie, its been too long.
You look terrific.
- Thank you.
So, uh... what do you think?
Well, it's bold and focused, as always.
I like it.
- Hey, you made it.
Hi.
- Hi.
Hi!
How-how are you?
Wanna buy youselves a little condo?
I think Vincent's little condos are a little out of our league.
Right, you and your puny psychiatrist salary.
Hey, you guys.
Grab a drink, and we'll catch up with you later, alright?
- Alright, OK.
Congrats, buddy.
- Thanks, man.
- One hour, tops, then we're out of here.
- Oh, come on, hon.
We just got here.
Man, check out all these babes, so hot!
It's like they're in violation of the fucking fire code.
Marty, calm down.
I've seen them.
I can also see Mimi... your wife.
OK, save me... help me... protect me.
What's up, chubbs?
Havin' too much fun?
Nope, Just, uh, checkin' out the hipster crowd with my pal, Luke.
Mmm-hmm!
Yeah, if you embarrass me, you may be here all by yourself.
Oh, don't raise my hopes only to dash them.
- Hi, Luke.
Where's Allie?
- Uh, she's just feeling dizzy.
Ducked out to check her blood sugar.
Hi, Allie.
You feel OK?
Oh, I, um... started to feel not so great, before, but...
- I'm better now.
- We can always go home, sweetie.
Did you hear that, sweetie?
After she just checked her blood sugar.
That's funny.
That's really good.
I would love to see you deal with something like that, if it was me.
Oh, you know, baby, I'd love to stick you in the ass, every day.
- How many times have I asked?
- Honey.
- What?
- Not now.
- You're the shrink, aren't you?
- Uh, yeah, that's right.
Chris Vanowen.
Ah!
Dr. Vanowen!
That's right.
Yes, I remember.
- Do we know each other?
- Uh, no... uh, you knew my sister.
She was a-a patient of yours, actually.
Sofie?
Sofie Morris?
No.
I'm sorry.
I'm-I'm really sorry.
Some people are just... born unhappy.
I'm sorry, are you buying an apartment?
What?
Umm, no... no-no, I'm friends with the architect.
- Oh!
- Are you?
No, no, I'm here with, uh, Joel Kotkin.
The city Councilman.
I work for him.
A sort of, uh, personal assistant.
Oh.
- I-I'm Anne.
Anne Morris.
- Very nice to meet you, Anne.
- And listen, about your sister...
- It's OK.
You couldn't have saved her.
Her mood disorder kinda runs in the family... unfortunately, so...
Well, you're not thinking of doing something stupid, are you, Anne?
Me?
Uh, you mean like falling...
for the wrong man?
Well,
I do that all the time.
Everything's alright.
Come on.
Keep partying.
What are you doing?
- Phil, I shoulda I guessed.
- Hey, Vince, what's up?
How are you?
Thanks for coming.
Hey, I'm sorry about this, she slipped, man, alright?
- No worries.
As long as you're OK.
You alright?
- She's fine.
Come on.
Uh, let me introduce you to, um, a colleague, who works with me, at the office... and, uh, this one... works with me, down at the office.
- Or is it other way around?
- Philip.
Ooh!
My big brother!
How you doing man?
- Friends of Vicky's?
Bridesmaids?
- Aw, come on, man.
I'm s-selling, you know?
- What are you doing?
- What?
It's not like I don't love my little Vicky, man.
I love her madly!
You know that.
Alright?
It's not like I hate all the other women in the world, man.
Right.
Alright, alright, relax.
There's something I wanna show you.
Let's go get Marty and Luke.
Chris?
- Gentlemen!
Welcome to the loft.
- Wow, this is impressive, Vince!
Check out the view.
Then, imagine that this is our own private oasis, right in the heart downtown.
What do you mean?
A place where no one hassles you.
A place you can escape to, any time you want.
- OK, so, this your loft?
- No, it's ours... if you want it.
- What?
Ours?
- Think about it.
No messy hotel bills, no...
questionable credit card activity.
This would be our secret place.
To steal away, discreetly and economically, in these... challenging times.
Five way split.
What do you think?
I don't know.
I'm not like that.
Come on, Chris.
We're men.
We're all a little like that.
Yeah, tell me about it.
Give me your key right now, bring your twins up here, give 'em a little private tour.
You know what they cost, Marty?
How much?
I might have it on me, right now.
Seriously.
Think about it.
It's a great investment.
A once in a lifetime golden opportunity.
- I can't stay here.
- Where are you going?
Luke?
You cannot freak out, right now.
We have to stay together, like we said.
Alright, alright.
Luke, you just calm the fuck down.
No, no!
It's over, Vincent.
It's all gonna come out!
It's not over.
Listen!
We're gonna find out what happened here and we gonna fix it.
OK?
Try Phil again.
This is Philip.
Please leave a message after the tone.
What if he doesn't show?
We need to be out of the country by...
He'll show.
- You can't cover him, Chris.
Not this time.
- Guys, look at this.
- What's it mean?
- What does it mean?
- Do you know Latin, Doctor?
- Excuse me?
Latin, do you know Latin?
- I took it pre-med, yeah.
- What's it say on the wall, there?
Fatum nos iungebit.
Fatum nos iungebit?
I can read that.
What's it mean?
- I'm guessing you already know what it means.
- No, we would like to hear you say it.
You'd like to hear me say it?
OK.
Fatum nos iungebit, uh...
Fate will unite us.
Now, all I can possibly think, is that somebody, who knows Latin, like you... reached over, with this young lady's hand, and wrote Fatum nos iungebit on the wall.
- Fatum nos iungebit is wrong.
- How so, Doctor?
The future imperfect tense.
The verb, unite, iungere is not iungebit.
It's iunget.
It should say fatum nos iunget.
So, the person you're looking for, made a classic Latin error.
I'm guessing you knew that already, too.
Didn't you?
Know the phrase, "Fuck You"?
Germanic origin.
- Where's your brother?
- I'm sorry, I can't help you with that one.
Right.
Well, actually, he's your half brother, isn't he?
Same mother, different fathers?
He spent some time in various institutions, with your half-sister, Zoe.
Yeah, that's right.
After our mother died, um...
Philip wasn't... wasn't as lucky with his father.
- Apparently, not.
Alcoholic child beater.
- Mmm.
You didn't spend much time with Philip back then, did you?
No.
But now, you're best friends?
- Well, we've had a lot of catching up to do.
- You really don't know where we can find him?
Fate will unite us?
- Where the hell's your brother, Chris?
- I don't know.
What the hell is this?
- Where the fuck is Philip?
- I'm right here.
- Now, what the hell's going on?
- You did this.
- You DID THIS!
- Luke, Luke, Luke!
Luke!
- Come here, hey, hey!
- Hands off me!
Bring it on!
- What is this?
- Luke!
Did you have anything to do with this?
I don't know what the fuck you're talking about!
Just answer the fucking question!
Did you do this?
Of course not!
Jesus Christ!
Were you here last night?
No, man.
I wasn't here last night.
I slept at my in-laws.
You don't believe me, call Vicky.
What about this morning.
Were you here this morning?
I was at a project site, alright?
With my father-in-law.
My God!
- Where were you last night?
Where've you been?
- Philip, take it easy.
Before accusing everyone else, where've you been?
'Cause I've never got a text that's sayin' the loft was taken.
Never..
- Last night, I was at home.
- Can you prove it?
No, I can't prove it, because Barbara's taken the kid skiing.
You'll have to take my word for it!
- Alright, guys!
Come on, come on!
- Your word?
!
There's a dead woman in our loft...
that only us have access to.
Now, if anybody has anything to do with this, now's the time to say it, right now.
- Thank you, very much.
- Well, Philip's got a ball and chain, now.
- Who woulda thunk it?
- Who's the father-in-law, again?
His name's Hiram Fry.
He's a...
huge property developer.
His friends call him, "The Man of Steel".
He's worth millions.
Vicky's his only daughter.
- So, what's not to love?
- I just hope Philip will be happy.
Well, that's cozy.
Come on.
Ever since Councilman Kotkin got elected, Man of Steel's been busy rebuilding Downtown.
- Kotkin came to your opening, right?
- Yeah, he turned up for a photo-op.
When it comes to handing out permits and contracts, though... game's rigged.
Wait a minute.
Tell me what we're talking about, again?
'Cause I just saw some mini cheesecakes.
Gorgeous, huh?
I mean this... whole setup.
Whoever said money can't buy happiness, sure hasn't lived this life.
Sorry boys, you lost your bachelor mascot.
He's all mine, now.
Good luck with breaking this bronco, Vicky.
God knows, others have tried.
- But I'm not others, am I, Philip?
- Ho, ho!
Told you!
And it's not just me.
Philip's married into the Fry family, now.
- As soon as we're back from Fiji...
- Yeah, well, I'm gonna sell some properties with Vicky's dad.
You know, see how it grabs me.
Wow!
Grabs you.
- Well, guys, thanks for coming.
- Congratulations.
I'll be with you in a second, baby.
Oh, man!
I need a break from all the ass kissing, man.
- Where is Fiji?
- I don't know, man.
Phil.
Your wedding present.
- Are you for real?
- Absolutely!
Don't lose it.
There's only five of these in existence.
Accepting a key to the loft, means you accept rules to the loft.
Marty?
What are you, crazy?
Our wives are here.
Don't you think that's a bit cynical, handing those things out here?
Cynical?
It's just a key to a room.
You should check it out.
Oh, no, you're not like that.
Not now, maybe later.
What about you, Luke?
Now, or later?
Come on.
Attaboy!
Well, you just make sure this doesn't blow up in your faces.
How's it gonna blow up in our face?
It's just a room.
Like Vince said.
Our room.
Now, we keep it to ourselves, alright?
Tell nobody.
Just stays within our circle.
Marty?
Yeah?
Yeah!
Now you just need to find someone willing to go with you, Marty.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, I think there's, uh, plenty of choices, right here.
Some of these guys bring some premium grade, high test pussy.
Like that little, dewy-eyed vixen, right there.
- She looks underage.
- Uh, she's twenty.
If one of you messes with her, I'm gonna crack your head wide open!
Oh, what, have you got dibs on miss curly locks?
Listen, man.
That's Zoe, alright?
- Zoe?
- Yeah.
- Like, as in skin and bones, tomboy, Zoe?
- Yeah.
I hate to say it, Phil, but your little sister is seriously hot.
- Thanks man.
- She's not little any more.
That is the finest piece of ass...
Yo, Marty, it's enough.
I'm just saying...
I want to fuck her like an animal, you know...
- Come on, Marty, it's enough.
- feel it from the inside?
I wanna fuck you like an animal.
You're not saying another word.
You don't talk about my sister, got it?
You got it?
- Fuck!
- You watch it!
You watch it.
Kick your ass at your own fucking wedding.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- We met at the, uh, the building opening.
- That's right.
You're...
Anne Morris.
- I'm glad you remember me, Chris.
- Mmm.
I see you work weekends.
What a dedicated personal assistant.
- What a lucky city councilman.
- Hah!
Screw him.
Do you?
Does it get a bit boring, walking around all these parties by yourself?
He wants you close, but not too close.
Not when there's important people around.
I told you.
I fall for the wrong men.
Can you keep a secret?
Our City Councilman likes to keep my panties with him, at these events, in his pocket.
It's a turn-on for him.
The thought of me in a crowd, so naked...
only he knows.
- Why do you let him use you like that?
- Who says he's using me?
Maybe... it turns me on.
Maybe, me telling you about it, turns me on, even more...
I hope you don't catch cold.
Chris.
Chris, I'm sorry.
I-I...
I don't know, maybe I-I was testing you.
I don't need to be tested.
Listen, do you want... maybe get a cup of coffee... someplace quiet... private?
I'd like to use your key.
Just once.
It's not what you think.
Hey, it doesn't matter what I think.
Have fun.
- Does everyone still have a key?
- Of course we do.
It's crucial we get this right.
Five keys were cut.
To make a sixth, you'd need the code, which is in my safe.
So, we can rule that out.
But there was no break-in, so does everyone still have a key?
What, you think we've been giving away our keys?
It's against your rules, Vince.
- Then, show me.
- Well, what are we trying to prove here?
Look, I don't know.
Maybe someone's lost a key.
OK?
Let-let's just rule that out.
OK?
Look.
Here's mine.
Alright?
Chris?
You didn't use a key to get in, just then.
- No.
I didn't bring it.
- Where is it?
I don't have it on me, OK?
It's not like I need it every day, like some of you guys.
- But you do still have it?
- Vincent, whether or not I have my key on me, right now, is really not important.
It's extremely fucking important.
- Someone got in using a key and yours is missing.
- Is that right Vincent?
Then how do you account for the fact that the alarm was shut off?
So, let's just cut the bullshit, 'cause it definitely had to be one of us five.
Unless...
- Unless what?
- Unless she let him in.
Oh, yeah?
Then how'd she get in, Vincent?
Any way you look at it, it keeps coming back down to us, and I, for one, would like to know, who's hiding something?
- Is there a word for that?
- Yes, polyamory.
It's a... philosophy, some sort of belief system about being romantically involved with more than one person, at the same time.
- Uh, huh.
- And your boss get away with that?
Yes, he says that he's in love with his wife and his girlfriend, so why should he have to choose?
- Uh, huh.
- And his wife is amazingly cool with it.
Oh, really?
Is she special needs?
Maybe oxygen deprived?
What?
Explain.
I'd like to know.
It sounds like my kind of philosophy, Barbara.
What's it called again?
Polyannemarie?
Please, spare us, chubbs.
You can barely handle one woman.
What would you do with two?
Hmmm.
Marry one.
I would make up something.
Some sort of game that involves two ladies and one guy.
Start a trapeze act, or something.
Could you at least fake some enthusiasm?
It's your party.
Anyway, I'm cooking.
You absolutely have to invite your friends over, could you at least try and make it home in time?
They're never here, OK?
Will you just join us?
I just hope the pudgy clown doesn't puke on the rug.
He's been chugging Vodka like it's Evian.
I mean, doesn't his wife see that?
Actually, she was just cool with it long enough to catch him in the act.
She hired a detective.
Cellphone records, credit card receipts, audio, video, the works.
And, in a heartbeat, my poor boss went from polyamory to alimony.
Man, your boss sounds mentally retarded.
So, what-what happened to him?
Oh, uh... he and his concubine are now cramped in a tiny one bedroom condo... but, I'm guessing he's happy.
She's blonde, 23, with a brand new pair of fake breasts.
How can men stand fake breasts?
Why are women always talking about fake tits this, fake tits that?
I mean, listen, girls, if it's a decent boob job, who fucking cares, you know?
My mom... my mom, she's got, uh... false teeth, OK?
When she smiles, do people give her shit and say, "Oh, my God!
Look!
Fake!"
No, they don't, they say, "Wow!
you look way better, now.
It's an improvement."
You know, you women, you're so catty, so competitive.
Calm down, tubby, dearest...
No, no.
You know what, no?
It's nothing-nothing to calm about, Mimi.
I mean, a glorious big setup, fucking tits and a nice piece of ass.
It's-it's-it's thrilling.
It's thrilling.
This is all... a little too highbrow for my teeny, tiny, catty... female mind.
Oh, well, you know what?
You should have that enlarged.
Huh?
And while you're under, you should have the corners of your mouth lifted so you can smile every once in awhile.
Sorry.
Sorry, Chris!
- Marty?
Marty, come on!
- What?
What?
No.
No, you're class act, Marty.
Mimi, would you like to get your husband another drink, or should I, do the honors?
You should do it, and I want it chilled...
- and then you go with her and stir...
- Honey....
The problem with your boss, Barbara, is he didn't have his shit together.
I mean, apart, part, I mean, he didn't, no, I mean he didn't compartmentalize.
Do you guys agree?
- Alright, Marty.
How would you compartmentalize?
- How?
OK, well, since you ask.
First thing first is, I wouldn't have a place that you could get caught.
Not a hotel, not your girlfriend's crib.
It's key, right?
Am I right?
Vinny, boy.
Am I right?
Marty, you've-you've lost us all.
I doubt that.
I doubt that, Vinny boy.
It's, OK.
First of all, sorry, baby, I would just get a little, you know, a little one bedroom condo, or something like that.
Oh, you alright?
Mimi, your husband tends to talk out his ass when he's been drinking, yeah?
Alright, there we go.
- Honey, would you give me a hand?
- Sure.
- Sorry, didn't know you were in here.
- Yeah, no problem.
Hey, too much, too fast, I guess.
Thai food, you know.
Yeah, it gets all up in your nose and shit.
Yeah, it's a little spicy.
Yeah.
I'm outta here.
Boy.
- I need to pick up some more insulin.
- Luke... is there something you wanna tell me?
- Are you keeping secrets?
- What kind of secrets?
Is there someone else?
I don't know why you start asking me silly questions, but the answer is no.
- I'm not cheating on you, honey.
- It's not why I'm asking, Luke.
I'm asking if there's someone else.
Listen, sweetie.
Whatever I may be, or may not be, and...
I know I'm not as glamorous as some.
But I'll always be there for you...
and the children.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
I want you to know... there's a lot I could put up with...
What are you doing?
- I need to get her out of here.
- How?
She is shackled to the bed!
Can't you guys see what's going on?
Someone is trying to frame us.
- Who?
who wants to frame us?
- I don't know.
But think about it.
The body's cuffed to the bed.
It's possible to move.
The Latin.
The knife.
Someone did this for a reason.
Hell, the cops could be here any second.
Yeah, but none of us know who this girl is.
We don't even know how she got in here.
Who else knew about the arrangement?
Who else knows about our arrangement?
Did anyone blab?
Tell one of the girls that have been up here?
Marty?
What?
Why me?
- It was some night you were hammered, maybe.
- I've always followed the rules, Vincent.
Did you give anyone your code.
Did you-did you key in, while someone was watching?
Absolutely not.
I just told you.
Alright, wait!
What's your point, Vincent?
Where are you going with this?
- Someone is trying to set us up.
- Like who?
I don't know.
A-a rejected girlfriend.
A jealous boyfriend, betrayed husband.
Someone with a motive.
Look, is one of you guys in some kind of trouble?
I think I may be falling in love with you.
- You don't have to say that.
- No, but, I mean it.
Why would say that, Chris?
Why would you even feel it?
I've never cheated on my wife before...
and I don't fall in love easily.
Chris, I don't want you to love me.
You don't even know me.
Apart from these stolen moments...
they're exciting, yeah, sure, but... they're just moments.
- Let's change that.
I wanna see you more often.
- Chris, please.
- Not just for this.
- No.
Stop it.
I...
I don't want you to love me.
Well, I don't wanna keep sneaking around.
- I'm gonna tell Allison about us.
- No, you're not.
Yes, I am.
Anne!
- I'm gonna leave her.
- Stop it.
Why you doing this?
The people you love... they're the only ones who can hurt you.
- I would never hurt you, Anne.
- Stop.
Stop what?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Would you...
Stop it, OK?
You don't know me, OK?
That's the end of it.
No.
- Well, would you give me a chance, at least...
- I'm a whore... alright?
- What?
- I'm a prostitute.
I fuck men for money.
Do you get it now?
Don't worry, doctor, I won't bill you for the past
- few months.
- Please, Anne, would you wait, would you...
- Chris...
- Would you wait a minute?
please stop it.
You don't know half of it, alright?
Just go home.
Go home to your wife and your kids.
Is your friend, Chris Vanowen, cheating on his wife, Mr. Landry?
Oh, I-I doubt that.
Chris is a very devoted husband and, um....
And a model dad... just like all the rest of your pals, right?
Except for you, you're not exactlty squeaky clean, are you, Marty?
Um, I don't know what you mean.
Why does your wife want a divorce?
Divorce is not the right...
What we're going through... a separation.
It's a trial separation.
Why?
Uh, because she found out something that she, uh, wasn't too happy about.
- You fucked around on her?
- If you wanna be technical.
How'd she find out?
- The woman with whom I...
- Fucked around?
Yeah.
Apparently expected something a little more, and she showed up on our front porch.
Bitch started the... woman, in question, started saying things.
And my only hope is that Mimi will come around, eventually, because I love her very much.
- Did you go, with this woman, to the loft?
- What?
No.
This happened in San Diego.
Well, that's where you met the woman, right?
In San Diego?
Yeah.
Why you were there?
A commercial real estate convention.
Vince had a couple extra tickets, a VIP thing.
You know, it's... a couple nights in a fancy hotel and chance to get away for a couple days.
- And nights.
- Yeah, nights, too.
Man, you see that?
Jesus, Vince, those girls are drooling all over you.
Invite 'em over.
I got first dibs.
I'll be happy with second best, too.
I don't take a raincheck on that.
What?
Are you fucking crazy?
Why wouldn't you invite them over?
'Cause, Marty, I'd rather die for some rare and exotic sea creature, than shoot fish, in a barrel.
Does Barbara know about these deep sea expeditions of yours?
- What, are you kidding me?
- Yeah!
What's your problem, Seacord?
I mean, you've got a key to the loft.
What do you do up there?
Laundry?
Dishes?
Hey, are you guys here on business, or what?
I'm Dana.
My first time here.
It's a little over priced, for what you get.
Don't you think?
Hi, Dana, I'm Vincent.
This is, uh, Marty, Luke.
Can we, uh... buy you a drink?
Hey, when I said over priced I wasn't trolling for free booze!
- No-no.
I mean, I didn't say...
- Well, since you asked, what're you drinking?
- Ohhh, champagne.
A girl can dream...
- Champagne?
- Please.
- Alright, one champagne coming up.
What are you doing?
The fat chicks can scare off all the hot chicks.
Marty, every fat chick has a good looking friend.
Hers is probably on her way down, right now.
OK.
Yeah, well, what if she is the good looking friend, and the really fat chick's on her way down?
- I think that's Philip's father-in-law.
- Oh, yeah, it is.
I'll be!
That's The Man of Steel, alright.
That ain't Mrs. Steel.
- Think we should give him a key?
- Maybe.
Not mine.
I'd like a bottle of your finest champagne, and four glasses, please, for the table in the corner.
You, uh... were at my daughter's wedding.
Philip's friends.
You're the architect.
- Vincent Stevens.
- We should talk sometime, Mr. Stevens.
- Sure.
What have you got in mind, Mr. Fry?
- We have a new waterfront project.
It's massive, it's... cutting edge.
It might be right up your alley.
Of course, it's all preliminary.
We have to keep it under wraps.
- I hope you can be discrete.
- Sure.
Discretion, Mr. Stevens, that's the main thing.
Dictum sapienti sat est.
A word to the wise.
You are wise?
Yeah, sure!
Wise, uh...
wise and discrete, Mr. Fry.
I'm in software.
I can be discrete, myself, at once.
I'll pick up their tab, as well.
Have a nice evening, gentlemen.
- Sweetheart?
Sweetheart.
- Excuse me.
Hi!
This is Anne.
Leave a message.
Who are you calling at this hour?
Well, I'm just... checking my voicemail.
And what does your voicemail say?
That you're a lousy liar, Chris Vanowen?
- What are you talk...?
Something wrong?
- You tell me, Chris.
- Allison, I...
- I'm going to bed.
Allison!
Excuse me, this is not thinking.
It's called following your dick around.
Hey, two kinds of articles, in Cosmo, month after month.
One:
Men are pigs.
Two:
How do i seduce a pig to try my wood?
I don't read Cosmo, month after month!
- Well, I do.
- I don't!
- Well, I do.
- And I find it strangely...
You know what I find strangely compelling?
Grab ass.
- Huh!
Can't leave you alone for a minute?
- Sarah!
It's been more like an hour.
You'd think I'd have been subsidized.
Aren't you going to introduce me to your new friends?
And that was the first time you met her?
Yeah, that was, uh... that was the first time.
Sarah?
Yeah.
Her name was Sarah.
Mr. Stevens, what else happened in San Diego?
- What do you wanna know?
- Everything.
Keep it down, keep it down.
- This is insane, Sarah.
- You should never dare a crazy woman.
- Vincent, we should probably go back.
- We're quiet enough, it's OK.
Mmm!
Hmm.
Sorry, don't use the pool.
Now you have to keep your end of the bargain.
Come over here.
That's better.
Yeah...
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Come on, don't keep us waiting.
Take it off.
- I'm gonna be sick.
- What?
Vince's body's
- not that bad!
- Not Vince!
Shrimp cocktail!
What?
!
Dana...
Dana!
Come-come back...
come back here.
Your turn.
Take it all off.
Not bad.
Is this still too scary for you, Luke?
Are you gonna join us?
I'm-I'm fine, right here.
I need you, 'cause Vincent's gonna try and make a move on me, soon, and... if you're here, maybe he won't dare.
Or maybe Vincent's not interested.
Maybe Vincent'd rather do laps.
That would explain the last few hours of casual, but meaningful, glances that each lasted a second too long.
- You like to play games, huh?
- I do.
And I'll tell you something else.
I'm better at it than you.
- Can you feel me?
- Most definitely.
Marty?
- Marty, I need my room key.
- Oh, dude!
- Kinda busy here!
- Don't stop!
- Go!
Go!
- Shit!
You're scared, is what it is.
You're running away from your feelings.
I want to say goodbye.
Do you have any idea what it's like to really love someone?
I'm sorry.
What are you doing?
- Throw it away.
It's empty.
- You were here yesterday... weren't you?
Guys... we gotta go to the cops.
We're not getting anywhere with this.
Chris, I think Vincent has something to tell you.
Alright, let's hear it.
- Hello?
- Who is it?
Who is it?
It's a realtor, who wants to come up.
Somebody's listed the loft for sale?
- What?
!
- Oh, Jesus fucking...
Listed the loft?
She says she has an appointment with a Deakins?
Sarah Deakins?
Who-who's Sarah Deakins?
Wait... who the hell is trying to sell our loft?
- You know her, Marty.
- What?
You know her, and so does Luke.
Sarah Deakins is lying on the bed.
Hey guys, I-I promise, I have never seen a Sarah Deakins.
- That's not true.
You know her.
- Why do you keep saying that?
You met her, in San Diego.
The last night, in the bar, remember?
Dana's friend.
The last night I-I was wasted out of my mind.
The whole night's a blur.
Jesus!
- Luke, you... you remember her, don't you?
- That's Sarah?
You remember, Sarah?
You-you remember her, right?
Yes, I-I remember Sarah.
But how-how was I supposed to know that's Sarah?
Come on, guys, what the hell's going on?
You guys turned her over and looked at her face, I did not.
Yeah, I think there's been a mistake.
We don't know anyone named Sarah Deakins.
Alright, come on.
- Who is it?
Do we know her?
- I don't know.
Fuck!
So, is that all you wanna tell us, Vince?
Or is there more?
I had a, thing... with her.
I brought her up here a couple of times.
But I swear on my kids, I had nothing to do with this.
Will you just fucking tell me?
Were you here with her last night?
Were you the one who let her in?
I broke up with her last night.
I swear, she was alive, when I left.
It still doesn't explain why someone listed the loft!
Something special, or just browsing?
Why don't you return my phone calls?
If you're dumping me, at least have the decency...
Chris, how can I dump you?
There's nothing between us.
That's what it meant to you?
Nothing.
Did you forget what I told you, already?
Who I am?
What I do?
No, I haven't.
It doesn't change how I feel about you.
How many women have you taken to that that fuck pad you share with your four little buddies?
What?
Please, Chris... save it for some girl who'll actually buy your bullshit.
No, no, wait, wait.
You know I'm not like that.
Here.
I only need this if I'm with you.
So you keep it.
If you wanna see me again, you let me know.
Chris?
Oh!
What are you doing here?
Shopping for Allison?
Uhh, no, no, um, I was just...
here with a colleague.
Does your wife know you've been sharing a loft, with your pals?
I already told you, I'm not sharing a loft with any pals.
I was there, just once, at a party, when the building first opened.
Then, you have been there!
A minute ago, you didn't even know where the building was.
I never took anyone up there.
I thought that's what you meant.
Well, did you know the girl?
We met once, in San Diego.
Are you aware that Mr. Stevens began a relationship with her in San Diego?
That would surprise me, frankly.
You didn't know.
Isn't Vincent Stevens your best friend?
It's so obvious, what you're trying to do here.
You're trying to turn us against each other.
But guess what?
I'm not about to start trashing my friend.
Is it possible, Mr. Seacord, that you were jealous of you best friend?
I mean, he's nailing all these beautiful women...
I am a married man.
I'm not interested in nailing women.
I'm not jealous of Vincent.
Oh, no...
I didn't mean, jealous of him, Mr. Seacord.
I meant, jealous of the women.
Where do you get off... with an inuendo like that?
- Fucking bastards.
- Why so angry, Mr. Seacord?
Vincent is my closest friend, and he has been for years.
Yeah, fine.
But your best friend is selling you out, as we speak, Mr. Seacord.
You and the rest of your gang.
No, Vincent would never sell out his friends, and you're full of shit, asshole.
- What you call me?
- You heard me, you lying piece of shit!
- Look, I broke up with her and I left, that's it.
- Yeah?
After you cut her up with this, right?
- Put the knife down.
- Philip!
- Put the knife... put the knife down.
- Back off.
The loft is listed in her name.
That's not a coincidence.
- Someone's trying to pin this on us.
- On you, you mean!
Jesus!
Get a fucking grip!
Fuck!
Guys, we cannot keep doing this.
Well, what do you wanna do, Marty?
Huh?
Just leave me hanging?
Hey, Vince?
Vince?
Are you in there?
If you're in there, hey, man, I need to talk to you, for just a second.
Christ, Marty!
I got company.
Didn't you get my Text?
Mimi's gone!
- She's gone.
Fucking gone.
- What do you mean, gone?
Gone where?
She left me.
She found out about San Diego, that dumpy chick.
- She showed up and then told her everything.
- Fuck!
Wait a minute!
You didn't tell Mimi about the loft?
What?
!
It's not about the Goddamn loft, Vince.
It's about of my wife!
I don't know what I'm gonna do without her!
Did you-did you confess?
Then, never confess, Marty.
Never confess.
Would you go to her?
Just-just tell her that I love her.
You know, and that Dana's lying.
She'll believe you.
Marty, I will straighten this out for you.
I promise you, I will straighten this out.
- OK.
- Hey, come here.
OK.
- Thanks.
- OK, so, what's the plan?
What do we do now?
We get her out of here.
- What?
We can't just make a body disappear.
- Well, it's too bad.
It's our only hope.
You had a relationship with her.
Now she's some...
inconvenient piece of evidence?
- What kind of man are you?
- That's a laugh, coming from you.
And how do you plan to get her off the bed?
Cut off her hand?
Or do you have the key to those cuffs?
Do you know what?
I thought handcuffs were more your thing, than mine, Phil.
Meaning what?
You know exactly what I mean!
Shut up!
Shut up!
You just keep your fucking mouth shut, alright?
- Please!
Help-help me!
Please, help me!
- Keep your fucking mouth shut.
- This fucking whore's trying to rip me off.
- Please, help me.
He made me...
- Shut up, alright?
!
- Hey, take it easy.
Easy!
- Alright, alright.
- It's gonna be OK.
He's crazy!
Shit!
OK, OK.
Philip, give me the keys.
- Vince, she's gonna go to the cops, man.
- The keys for the handcuffs.
- She's gonna go to the cops, man!
- The keys!
You want the key?
Here's the key.
He made me do things...
I didn't wanna do.
- Shut up!
Shut up!
- Easy!
What, you want more money?
That's it, right?
It's all about the money, huh?
It's all about the fucking money!
- Here's your fucking money!
It's right there!
- Jesus Christ!
The fuck is the matter with you?
Have you lost your fucking mind?
She's a whore, Chris.
You know what a whore is?
- Shut up!
- You can't rape a whore.
- Shut up!
- You can't rape a whore!
You don't treat a woman like that!
You got it?
Not any woman!
- Back the fuck away!
- Hey!
Don't push me, alright?
!
What the fuck is the matter with you, man?
!
You're putting us all at risk.
- I want the police.
He... he hit me.
- Shut up.
- Make the cops arrest him!
He raped me!
- Shut up!
Stop screaming, or I'm gonna rip your Goddamn throat out!
I've had it with you!
You're no better than your father.
- I'm what?
- You heard me.
Oh, right, Chris.
That's a nice one.
Chris had a better deal with his daddy, right?
The great guy... who wants to save everyone.
Where were you... when Zoe and I...
were getting beat up?
And mom, in the next room, pretending not to hear.
Where were you?
In your cozy, college dorm, getting laid and wasted.
- 'Cause you didn't give a fuck.
- I didn't know anything about it.
You didn't give a crap, all those years!
We didn't exist for you.
I didn't know anything about it!
If you would've told me.
If you would've said something.
- Then what, you phony!
Then, what?
!
- I would've gotten you out of there, Goddamn it!
Both of you!
Listen.
I'm really, really sorry, but we can't go to the cops.
Here's what I'm gonna do.
No, listen!
I've a friend, he's a doctor.
- No!
- Yes, I'm gonna drive you to him.
- He's gonna take care of you, OK?
- No.
Now, here, listen... take it.
I know it's not enough for what happened tonight, but...
He's an animal.
He should be locked up.
OK.
And we're gonna deal with him.
I promise you.
Come on.
I'm gonna get your clothes...
I'm gonna take to you the doctor.
- No!
- Easy, here we go.
No!
I'll never forgive you for this...
NEVER!
What's your problem?
Jesus Christ!
Why-why don't I know anything about this?
And when did it happen?
A couple of weeks ago.
We decided to keep it to ourselves, 'cause that's the kind of friends we are.
Don't lecture me, alright?
Especially, about friendship.
Oh, you-you're right, sorry.
I meant to give you the cokehead rapist lecture.
Fuck you.
Well, look, you could see how I'd think you'd be involved in this.
I need to say something.
Shit!
- You had that coming!
- Relax.
Take it easy.
You son of a bitch.
You recorded...
everything that went on here?
- Every woman?
- Not every.
Not always.
Just... sometimes.
- At least I don't cheat on my wife.
- No, you just watch us and beat off.
- You sick fuck.
- You're a sick fuck!
Luke, did you record last night?
No.
You didn't say you were coming, which is against your rules.
And it wasn't the first time you broke your own rules... by the way.
Now you're scared, aren't you?
Now, you know I've documented pretty much everything you've been up to, here.
No worries, Vincent.
I'll keep my mouth shut, like I always do.
Did you see anything that can help us out, here?
Anything at all.
If all the people who've been hurt, and cheated on, find out the truth...
What do you think will happen, Vincent?
- What's the matter?
- Just don't feel like leaving, tomorrow.
- Serious?
You love skiing!
- Yes, I love to ski, but just not by myself.
Are you sure you can't come?
Hey, you know I can't come.
I can't just take off like that.
Hey.
I'll call you every day.
I love you
I know the drill.
One hour, right?
Wrong!
Have a blast.
Don't mind me.
Why should tonight be any different from the past few months?
Look, Allison, if it's alright with you, I'd rather not spoil tonight.
I'm sure it must be tempting to grab something shiny and new.
But do you ever think about what you might stand to lose, Chris?
- You could ruin more than just this evening.
- Tell me, are you still happy, Allison?
Oh, no!
'Cause it's for charity, my mother-in-law is about to join the party, for a little while.
- Hearing anything about the waterfront project?
- No, he's gonna call once he gets his permits.
Well, as far as I know, everything's approved.
- Really?
- Yeah.
Good evening, gentlemen.
- Ladies, you look absolutely ravishing, tonight.
- Thank you!
This is Vincent Stevens.
He's the architect who designed the new loft building, near the sports arena.
Oh, wonderful!
I love that building.
Why, thank you, Mrs. Kotkin.
I really appreciate that.
As I was saying, to your husband, in, uh, San Diego...
Gentlemen, in our business, can't afford to be...
exposed to the negative consequences of bad design.
Speaking of, uh...
San Diego...
How's that waterfront project coming along?
Oh, yes, uh... we're still working it on.
We've applied for all our permits.
Now we're waiting.
Standing in line, like everyone else.
You don't strike me as the type of man that stands in line, Mr. Fry.
What about you, Mr. Kotkin.
Are you a gambling man?
And you, Mr. Stevens?
You like to take chances?
As a matter of fact, I do.
Especially when I'm holding a handful of hearts.
Anyway, I don't mean to interrupt.
Ladies, if you're as lucky on the tables tonight, as you are in love, then I am sure you'll hit your jackpots.
Gentlemen, always a pleasure.
Blackjack.
Set aside enough for the alimony.
Mimi, what are you doing here?
Just 'cause I believed you, that doesn't mean I'm stuck at home.
Mimikin, I wanna come back.
I know I screwed up, once.
Once!
I was drunk off of my ass.
I swear It didn't mean a damn thing.
Something I don't understand about men.
If it doesn't mean anything, why bother?
I promise I'll change.
Into what, a frog?
So, if you're not a prince, how about the ass you already are?
What if I told you I wanted to fuck around tonight?
Sorry...
It would hurt like hell, wouldn't it?
Hey, maybe I already got even!
Maybe with one of your pals, huh?
Maybe Chris?
He's cute.
Or how about Vincent?
The night you sent him over for that tragic, heart to heart.
Oh, Marty's really so sorry.
Mimi, you gotta talk to him.
Blackjack.
Oh!
Well, look at that, chubbs!
Your first ever winning streak.
Just remember, dear heart... half of it is mine.
- You gave Zoe tickets, tonight?
- Philip, let go.
I keep her away from bullshit like this, and you're behind my back...
Christ, Phil, she's almost 20 years old.
What are you, her father?
Did You see her?
- God, she looks like a hooker.
- I thought you like whores.
Let her have some fun.
If you'll excuse me, I'm about to have some fun, too.
I'm kinda on a roll.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.
I hope you win big time.
You'll need it with all the shit you've been packing up your nostrils.
Oh!
So you noticed, a tiny fraction of your stash went missing?
You don't like it, file for divorce.
I haven't ruled that out.
Don't forget about our prenup, loser.
While you're at it, go play some Blackjack.
Could be your last best chance of paying the rent.
Can I get some dice over here?
Anne?
Anne?
We need to talk.
- Yeah, about what?
- Your pal, the architect.
- He's playing with fire.
- I'd actually rather talk about Anne.
I'll pass along your message to Vincent, but I'd like something, too, Mr. Kotkin.
I'd like for you to stop seeing Anne.
- And why would I do that?
- Because I love her.
Then we have more in common than we thought.
I'd like you to stop paying her.
I want you to let her go.
That's really not up to me.
Fact is, it's totally her choice.
Except I never paid for her.
Well, that's true.
You never paid.
Stop it, Joel!
I'm going.
- What did he mean by that?
'You never paid.'
- I don't wanna love you, Chris.
- Is he saying someone's paying you to be with me?
- You're the only one who can hurt me.
Anne.
Tell me it's a lie.
The first time, it was paid for.
Every other time, that was real, that was me.
- But, who paid?
- I can't.
- Excuse me.
Come on, Zoe, let's go.
- I'm fine here.
- I'm asking you to go with me.
Come on.
- I'm asking you to stop.
- OK, come on.
- Did you not hear the lady?
- Mind your business!
- Stop it!
What, are you deaf or just a dick, huh?
I don't know, man.
What does it say up here?
Deaf or dick?
Help me out, huh?
Come on!
- Excuse me!
Thank you.
Excuse me.
- You're not my dad!
- Shut up!
- Alright, somebody get this guy an ambulance.
I never wanna see you again.
Not in my home and not near my daughter.
Do you got that?
Get him the hell outta here.
OK, folks, let's get back to the gaming table, shall we?
Hey... it's OK.
- I'm sorry.
- Hey, it's OK.
- It's not what you're thinking.
- What I am thinking?
She's my friend's sister, OK?
Are there more?
Besides me, her and your wife.
What's the grand total?
Look, I can't have this conversation here.
Barbara's standing right over there.
- Do you love me?
- Of course, I love you.
I'm crazy about you.
So would you choose, me, if you could?
You know it's not that simple.
Come meet me in the loft, tomorrow, OK.
We'll talk it through.
You're right, it's not that simple.
- But maybe I can make it simple.
- What do you mean?
Maybe I can help you make that choice.
Sarah.
Sarah.
Sarah!
Sarah!
I'm sorry!
Are you alright?
Don't do it, Sarah.
You'll regret it.
They found out.
The wives, they did it.
They set us up.
Why, Vincent?
They found it.
They found out.
They found out about the Loft.
Why would you do it, Vincent?
We're your friends.
- No.
- Why'd you do it?
No, it was... the wives, they... they found out.
No, it's your friends.
We found out.
- What's going on?
- You still don't get it.
- Alright, let's strip him.
- What are you doing?
You are a total fucking psychopath.
- I did what you told me.
- I didn't tell you to fucking cut her open!
It wasn't part of the plan.
And the Latin on the fabric!
The cops aren't gonna believe that bullshit.
- Yeah, you should've done it yourself.
- Come on, let's do this.
- What'd you give me?
- What you deserve.
You killed Sarah?
- No, we just found her.
- What?
We were here, this morning, Vincent, before you arrived.
Jesus Christ.
At first, I thought she was sleeping.
Vincent knows her?
She-she left him this.
See you in the next life.
Why did she have to do it here?
We gotta call the cops.
They-they Investigate suicides.
This is all gonna come out.
Guys, wait.
Can't we find out, where she lives, and-and leave her there?
- Jesus!
- Philip!
Come on!
We have to help out Vince.
Yeah, speaking of which, where the fuck is Vince?
- Isn't this his problem?
- Ahemmm.
Vincent isn't here, because, um...
because I didn't call him.
You didn't call him?
Why didn't you call him?
There's something I have to show you.
You've been taping us?
!
You fucking pervert!
You can beat the crap out of me, later.
We don't have much time, and we need to watch this.
If we get a new perspective on what happened upstairs... maybe you'll agree... we shouldn't take the hit for Vincent's fuckup.
You see, Vincent...
Vincent hasn't always been a good friend.
No...
Hey, maybe I already got even...
Or maybe Vincent, the night you sent him over, for that tragic, heart to heart.
They got here late, the night he went to talk to her.
She was drunk, Marty.
He took advantage.
Wow!
Your little sister is seriously hot!
- How long has...?
- It doesn't matter.
How long?
He started seeing her right after your wedding.
They met here, on a regular basis.
If I'm not mistaken, he was her first.
Fuck!
Gorgeous, huh?
The people you love... they're the only ones who can hurt you.
He paid Anne... to let you seduce her.
Put the hook in, so you'd wanna share the loft.
The first time, it was paid for.
Have fun.
Chris, please, you don't know the half of it, alright?
Just go home.
He used her, Chris.
Just like he used everyone.
Everyone.
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.
Vincent can't sense anything is up, when he walks in.
We have to try and remain calm.
We're gonna get questioned by the cops.
That's why we can never admit we're sharing this loft.
They'll try to turn us against each other.
OK.
I think this can work.
As long we follow the plan.
Chris?
OK.
I'm in.
But, only if we know for sure, that Vincent was here last night.
I wanna hear him say it.
And if he does, I'll go through with it.
I'll give a signal, uh...
break something, a glass... but nothing happens, until we know for sure.
Understood?
We've got just under two hours to set everything up and establish alibis.
I'll take care of it.
You guys get outta here.
Make sure people see you.
- You have the suicide note, right?
- I've got it.
You knew what that prick was up to.
And you never said anything.
You're just as sick as Vincent.
They met here on a regular basis.
Vincent hasn't always been a good friend.
He started seeing her right after your wedding.
If I'm not mistaken, he was her first.
You are a total fucking psychopath.
- I did what you told me.
- I didn't tell you to fucking cut her open.
It wasn't part of the plan.
And the Latin on the fabric!
The cops aren't gonna believe that bullshit!
What happened here?
You're framing me!
Swallow it.
Swallow.
My own friends.
My own friends!
- Am I gonna die?
- No, Vincent, you're not gonna die.
Sarah lured you here and drugged you.
Then she killed herself, with you by her side.
Fate will unite us.
But you're gonna survive.
'Cause we're friends, aren't we?
So, you see?
It was a setup.
Sarah and I were set up.
The whole thing was staged.
Still sounds a little unbelievable, don't you think?
- Unbelievable, but it's the truth.
- Yeah.
My line of work, you gotta prove the truth, and you prove it with facts and findings.
Fact is, we only found your prints and those of Sarah Deakins.
Yeah, because they wiped the place clean.
And we have the DVDs of all your sexual exploits, with your prints all over them.
Luke made those DVD's!
I neither even saw 'em, let alone, touched 'em.
Yeah, but we've got no DVDs of your friends.
No DVDs of Marty's wife.
No DVDs of Philip's sister.
No DVDs of Chris' girlfriend, alright?
Facts and findings, Mr. Stevens.
And we got no evidence that you were being set up.
Alright.
Is there anything we've forgotten?
Yeah, to follow the fucking plan.
Why didn't you just handcuff her?
- She was already dead.
- Still no reason to mutilate her.
She killed herself.
I just made it more dramatic.
Yeah, well, you better hope your dramatics don't put us in jail.
Look, just-just lean on 'em a little bit.
Marty will break, maybe Luke, too.
Look, don't tell me how to do my work, alright?
We questioned them all.
I got no reason to believe they've been lying.
- Plus, all your friends have alibis.
- Alibis?
Not for this morning, they don't.
We got Luke Seacord and Chris Vanowen, together, at breakfast.
We got Marty Landry, at his office, alright?
At his office?
Look... for at least an hour, this morning, we were all in the loft.
So was Phil.
What about Phil?
Actually, he's downstairs, right now, with his father-in-law.
Fry?
What the fuck's Fry doing here?
He just gave a statement.
Saying that he was with his son-in-law, all day.
- That is bullshit!
That is a false statement!
- And why would he lie?
Hiram Fry brings a lot of credibility.
Credibili...
I saw Fry, in San Diego, with some... bimbo, OK?
Phil knew that.
He knew I pressured Fry into giving me a waterfront contract.
So you tried to blackmail Hiram Fry?
Vincent Stevens, enough of this crap.
We got your prints all over the DVDs, we got 'em all over the knife.
We got you chained, next to the dead girl, on the bed, alright?
Call your lawyer.
Make a confession and save your ass.
You're free to go.
I wanna thank you for your cooperation.
You understand, we had to check out your friend's story.
Of course, that's your job.
There's just... one thing that's bothering me.
Why does Vincent Stevens keep accusing his best friends?
I-I don't know.
It bothers me, too.
Could it be...
I just...
I just wonder...
You think he's trying to hide something else?
- Wha-what, what would he hiding?
- Sarah Deakins' murder.
Murder?
But... the Detective, in the interrogation, called it a suicide.
Well, that's what it looked like.
But the autopsy report revealed that sleeping pills didn't kill her.
And, her wrist was cut, but not by Sarah.
Hesitation marks, those... tentative attempts, the first ones, before a suicide actually slashes through an artery.
The Coroner didn't find those on her.
- But, Vincent... he, uh... he would never...
- His prints are on the knife.
We didn't find a suicide note.
Is there something wrong?
We didn't find a suicide note.
- You have the suicide note, right?
- I've got it...
Luke.
Chris!
You scared me.
You sure it's smart... meeting here?
I think we have a problem, Luke.
How so?
Where is Sarah's suicide note?
You put it in your pocket.
Yeah, coulda sworn, I did.
But it's not there any more.
So, when did you steal it from my coat?
When the doorbell rang this morning?
Surprise visit, from the realtor?
Chris, it's, uh... it's unfortunate that you lost Sarah's suicide note, but...
I had nothing to do with that.
I called the agency to ask who put our loft up for sale.
All they could give me was a number.
I did call them.
I wanted to...
I thought, maybe that...
It's over, Chris.
We pulled it off.
We've got nothing to worry about, now.
But, why'd that note disappear?
The only real proof of her suicide?
Hello?
Says she's got an appointment with someone named Sarah Deakins?
Who's Sarah Deakins?
Is it because maybe she didn't write it?
Maybe it's your handwriting?
Vincent fucked us all.
You saw.
Yeah, I saw.
All the DVDs that made everybody crazy.
Went right along with your grand plan, didn't it?
But why, Luke?
What did you do to that girl?
Did she get in your way?
Between you and Vincent?
Actually, it was Vincent... standing between us.
Is there someone else?
Much...
Sarah!
Wait.
Forget Vincent.
He's better at games than you.
Always was, always will be.
He's hurting you.
Using you.
Why are you telling me this?
I'm telling you because...
because I'd never hurt you.
Just give me the chance...
to show I'd never hurt you.
That's right.
You'd never hurt me.
Because I feel nothing for you, Luke.
I'm sorry.
Maybe in another life.
You were here last night?
Barbara was off skiing.
So I figured I'd find Vincent here...
- with Sarah.
- I'm sorry.
I waited 'til he left.
She said I was right about Vincent.
Consoling...
I've gotten so good at it.
I gave her an insulin OD.
It's quick, painless.
Leaves no trace.
Jesus, Luke.
I did it out of love...
I swear.
And Vincent taking the fall for this.
It's OK with you?
Vincent used everyone and anyone!
It's about time we turned the tables!
Well, he's being charged with murder.
Yeah.
Sarah wasn't dead, when you left her with Philip.
- No... no, you're lying.
- No.
That's not possible.
What Philip did to her... was sick.
You're sick, Luke.
But... if I'm hearing you right... it was your brother... who killed Sarah.
OK, Chris.
Go home.
I'll clean up.
Like always.
No.
No more cleaning up, Luke.
- Step outside.
- Luke.
Now.
Jesus!
Let me help you, Luke, please!
- You gonna kill me, too?
- It's your own fault.
- What do you want me to do, jump?
- Yes, if you don't mind!
Luke!
You don't need to do this.
Jesus Christ, Luke.
Will you stop it?
I don't wanna hurt you, Chris.
I really don't.
- So just do it.
- Never!
I called the cops, before I came.
I told them everything.
- Bullshit!
I know you haven't.
- I thought I knew you.
What about the note, huh?
You want this to go down with me, too?
Give me that note, Chris.
Give it to me!
It's over, Luke.
You're right.
It is over.
Tell Allie and the kids...
I'm sorry.
Would you do that for me, Chris?
- No,
- Come on, Chris.
Be a friend.
Luke!
Luke!
Luke!
Luke!
Luke!
- They're married.
- Honey, no.
They're having an affair.
- Because she's laughing at his jokes?
- No, I'm telling you they're having an affair.
Well, since when are you the big expert on affairs?
Really?
Thanks for taking me back, Meems.
Well, what was my alternative?
To leave you wailing at the front door, with snot pouring out of your nose?
Sorry, didn't mean to scare you off.
I have the kids early tomorrow, so I gotta go.
Are you gonna leave me here, alone?
With my wife?
- Yes.
- Come on,
- we can at least have one more drink.
- There'll be plenty more drinks.
- Goodnight, Meems.
- Good night, Chris.
Chris!
- Anne?
- Hi.
Hi.
- You look good.
- Thank you, you, too.
Listen, I still have the key.
Do you want it back?
It won't work anymore.
Vincent's living there alone, now.
It's the only thing his wife let him keep.
- And, uh... and Philip?
- He's awaiting trial.
We'll see.
And you?
You doing OK?
- Yeah.
Most of the time.
- And the rest of the time?
I heard you ditched the City Councilman?
That's not all I've given up.
Uh, do you wanna grab a cup of coffee, or...?
SUBTITLES BY KOUSHIK DAS
I SWEAR TO GOD, I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.
WE WOULD LOVE TO BELIEVE YOU, MR. STEVENS, BUT YOU HAVE
TO ADMIT, YOUR VERSION OF EVENTS DOES SOUND PRETTY BIZARRE, DON'T YOU THINK?
LOOK, IT WAS A SETUP, OK?
THE WHOLE THING WAS STAGED.
SO YOU WERE AFRAID?
THAT'S YOUR CLAIM.
YOU WERE THE VICTIM?
WELL, I MEAN, YOU KNOW, NOT...
NOT LIKE...
NOT LIKE WHO?
NOT LIKE HER?
PLEASE, JUST TALK TO THE OTHERS GUYS.
HAVE YOU TALKED TO THE OTHERS THERE?
WE'RE DOING OUR JOBS.
SO, WHY DON'T YOU JUST DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND CONFESS?
YOU KNOW, SAVE SOME TIME, SAVE SOME LEGAL FEES.
COME ON.
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE US THROUGH THE EVENTS OF THIS MORNING?
AGAIN?
AGAIN, MR. STEVENS.
WHERE WERE YOU THIS MORNING, MR. STEVENS?
I WAS AT HOME.
ALONE.
MY WIFE'S TAKING THE KIDS SKIING.
YEAH, SURE, YOUR WIFE'S ON HER WAY BACK, AS WE SPEAK.
AND APPARENTLY, SHE HAS, UH, QUITE A FEW QUESTIONS, OF HER OWN.
SO, THE PHONE WOKE YOU AROUND WHAT TIME THIS MORNING?
I DON'T KNOW, UH, 9-9:30.
IT-IT WAS LUKE IN A PANIC.
HE SAID I HAD TO COME.
WHERE WERE YOU SUPPOSED TO GO?
TO THE LOFT.
HE TOLD ME TO COME TO THE LOFT.
DID HE SAY WHY HE WAS PANICKING?
NO.
WELL, DID YOU KNOW WHY HE WAS PANICKING?
NO, NOT YET.
LUKE.
LUKE?
OH, MY GOD!
OH, FUCK!
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, YOU JUST...
WERE YOU...
I WALKED, IN SHE WAS...
LYING THERE...
OH, FUCK!
HAVE YOU CALLED THE OTHERS?
CHRIS AND MARTY ARE ON THEIR WAY.
I-I STILL HAVEN'T REACHED PHILIP.
OK, WELL, UH...
KEEP CALLING, WE NEED EVERYBODY HERE.
DO YOU KNOW WHO SHE IS?
VINCENT, DO YOU KNOW WHO'S LYING THERE?
WHAT?
NO, OF-OF COURSE NOT.
WELL, HOW THE FUCK DID THEY GET IN?
WHAT WAS IT, A W-WINDOW, A DOOR?
WINDOWS ARE SEALED AND THE DOOR WAS LOCKED.
THE ALARM WAS TURNED OFF.
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
I'M TELLING YOU, THE DOOR WAS LOCKED AND THE ALARM WAS TURNED OFF.
BUT THAT'D MEAN THAT...
THAT SOMEONE GOT IN...
WITH ONE OF OUR KEYS.
DO YOU KNOW THE LOFT BUILDING AT THE CORNER OF SECOND AND SOUTH HOPE, MR. SEACORD?
NO.
YOU KNOW, THE NEW RESIDENTIAL ONE, DOWN BY THE SPORTS ARENA?
DESIGNED, I BELIEVE, BY YOUR GOOD FRIEND, VINCENT STEVENS.
VINCENT RUNS A VERY LARGE FIRM.
HE'S DONE A LOT OF BUILDINGS.
THERE'S A LOFT ON THE NINTH FLOOR, MR. SEACORD.
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN THERE?
NO.
STRANGE, BECAUSE ACCORDING TO OUR INFORMATION, YOU AND FOUR FRIENDS ARE SHARING THIS LOFT
SECRETLY, WITHOUT YOUR WIVES' KNOWLEDGE.
THAT IS RIDICULOUS.
DON'T THE FIVE OF YOU BRING WOMEN UP THERE?
GIRLFRIENDS, MISTRESSES, ONE NIGHT STANDS, CATCH OF THE DAY?
FIVE PALS, JUST LOOKING FOR PRIVACY AND FUN,
WITHOUT THE HASSLE OF VISA STATEMENTS AND HOTEL BILLS, THE MRS. MIGHT FIND.
THAT IS PREPOSTEROUS.
MAYBE, MR. SEACORD, BUT ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS ALREADY MADE A FULL CONFESSION.
YOU WANNA KNOW WHO?
LISTEN...
I DON'T DO THINGS LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW, FOOL AROUND WITH OTHER WOMEN, I...
YOU LOVE YOUR WIFE.
I LOVE MY WIFE, YES.
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR FACE, MR. SEACORD?
I WALKED INTO A DOOR.
OR WERE YOU IN A FIGHT?
I SAID I WALKED INTO A DOOR.
WHERE WERE YOU THIS MORNING?
OUT WITH CHRIS, HAVING BREAKFAST.
THERE'D BE A LOT OF PEOPLE AT THE RESTAURANT TO VERIFY THAT.
BY CHRIS, YOU MEAN DR. CHRIS VANOWEN, THE PSYCHIATRIST?
THAT'S RIGHT.
ONE OF YOUR LOFT BUDDIES?
CHRIS IS MARRIED.
HE'S GOT TWO KIDS AND, UH...
HE'S NOT A GUY THAT CHEATS ON HIS WIFE, EITHER.
I GOT A SERIOUS FUCKING PROBLEM, CHRIS.
OH, SHIT!
PHILIP.
PHILIP?
WHAT, YOU THINK YOUR BROTHER HAS SOMETHING TO DO THIS?
NO.
WE GOTTA CALL THE COPS.
YOU REALIZE WHAT'LL HAPPEN, IF WE CALL THE COPS?
THINK ABOUT OUR WIVES.
IT'S A DEAD WOMAN HERE, VINCENT.
WHY DO WE THINK PHILLIP IS INVOLVED?
LOOK, CHRIS, YOU KNOW WHAT HE'S CAPABLE OF.
YEAH, I KNOW.
MAYBE WE CAN HELP HIM, OK?
IF WE CAN JUST FIGURE OUT WHAT THE FUCK HAPPENED, THEN MAYBE WE CAN...
THEN WHAT, WE GONNA DUMP THE BODY SOMEWHERE?
LOOK, I DON'T FUCKING KNOW, BUT I'M NOT TAKING THE FALL FOR THIS.
MARTY...
SON OF A BITCH!
HAVE YOU SEEN PHIL?
DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS?
WAS HE HERE LAST NIGHT?
THIS CAN'T BE REAL.
WAIT, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I WANNA SEE HER.
PUT HER BACK.
GODDAMMIT.
WHO IS SHE?
I DON'T KNOW.
LOOK.
NONE OF US HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS, RIGHT?
RIGHT?
WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE AND WE'LL FIGURE A WAY OUT.
WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER, WE'LL GET OUT OF IT TOGETHER, OK?
BECAUSE WE'RE FRIENDS.
AGREED?
AGREED?
WELL, LOOKS LIKE THEY'LL LET ANYBODY IN, RIGHT?
.
CONGRATULATIONS, VINCE.
THIS ONE'S REALLY SPECTACULAR.
VERY SPECIAL.
I APPRECIATE THAT.
ALLIE, ITS BEEN TOO LONG.
YOU LOOK TERRIFIC.
THANK YOU.
SO, UH...
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
WELL, IT'S BOLD AND FOCUSED, AS ALWAYS.
I LIKE IT.
HEY, YOU MADE IT.
HI.
HI.
HI!
HOW-HOW ARE YOU?
WANNA BUY YOUSELVES A LITTLE CONDO?
I THINK VINCENT'S LITTLE CONDOS ARE A LITTLE OUT OF OUR LEAGUE.
RIGHT, YOU AND YOUR PUNY PSYCHIATRIST SALARY.
HEY, YOU GUYS.
GRAB A DRINK, AND WE'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU LATER, ALRIGHT?
ALRIGHT, OK.
CONGRATS, BUDDY.
THANKS, MAN.
ONE HOUR, TOPS, THEN WE'RE OUT OF HERE.
OH, COME ON, HON.
WE JUST GOT HERE.
MAN, CHECK OUT ALL THESE BABES, SO HOT!
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE IN VIOLATION OF THE FUCKING FIRE CODE.
MARTY, CALM DOWN.
I'VE SEEN THEM.
I CAN ALSO SEE MIMI...
YOUR WIFE.
OK, SAVE ME...
HELP ME...
PROTECT ME.
WHAT'S UP, CHUBBS?
HAVIN' TOO MUCH FUN?
NOPE, JUST, UH, CHECKIN' OUT THE HIPSTER CROWD WITH MY PAL, LUKE.
MMM-HMM!
YEAH, IF YOU EMBARRASS ME, YOU MAY BE HERE ALL BY YOURSELF.
OH, DON'T RAISE MY HOPES ONLY TO DASH THEM.
HI, LUKE.
WHERE'S ALLIE?
UH, SHE'S JUST FEELING DIZZY.
DUCKED OUT TO CHECK HER BLOOD SUGAR.
HI, ALLIE.
YOU FEEL OK?
OH, I, UM...
STARTED TO FEEL NOT SO GREAT, BEFORE, BUT...
I'M BETTER NOW.
WE CAN ALWAYS GO HOME, SWEETIE.
DID YOU HEAR THAT, SWEETIE?
AFTER SHE JUST CHECKED HER BLOOD SUGAR.
THAT'S FUNNY.
THAT'S REALLY GOOD.
I WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU DEAL WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT, IF IT WAS ME.
OH, YOU KNOW, BABY, I'D LOVE TO STICK YOU IN THE ASS, EVERY DAY.
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I ASKED?
HONEY.
WHAT?
NOT NOW.
YOU'RE THE SHRINK, AREN'T YOU?
UH, YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
CHRIS VANOWEN.
AH!
DR. VANOWEN!
THAT'S RIGHT.
YES, I REMEMBER.
DO WE KNOW EACH OTHER?
UH, NO...
UH, YOU KNEW MY SISTER.
SHE WAS A-A PATIENT OF YOURS, ACTUALLY.
SOFIE?
SOFIE MORRIS?
NO.
I'M SORRY.
I'M-I'M REALLY SORRY.
SOME PEOPLE ARE JUST...
BORN UNHAPPY.
I'M SORRY, ARE YOU BUYING AN APARTMENT?
WHAT?
UMM, NO...
NO-NO, I'M FRIENDS WITH THE ARCHITECT.
OH!
ARE YOU?
NO, NO, I'M HERE WITH, UH, JOEL KOTKIN.
THE CITY COUNCILMAN.
I WORK FOR HIM.
A SORT OF, UH, PERSONAL ASSISTANT.
OH.
I-I'M ANNE.
ANNE MORRIS.
VERY NICE TO MEET YOU, ANNE.
AND LISTEN, ABOUT YOUR SISTER...
IT'S OK.
YOU COULDN'T HAVE SAVED HER.
HER MOOD DISORDER KINDA RUNS IN THE FAMILY...
UNFORTUNATELY, SO...
WELL, YOU'RE NOT THINKING OF DOING SOMETHING STUPID, ARE YOU, ANNE?
ME?
UH, YOU MEAN LIKE FALLING...
FOR THE WRONG MAN?
WELL,
I DO THAT ALL THE TIME.
EVERYTHING'S ALRIGHT.
COME ON.
KEEP PARTYING.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
PHIL, I SHOULDA I GUESSED.
HEY, VINCE, WHAT'S UP?
HOW ARE YOU?
THANKS FOR COMING.
HEY, I'M SORRY ABOUT THIS, SHE SLIPPED, MAN, ALRIGHT?
NO WORRIES.
AS LONG AS YOU'RE OK.

SHE'S FINE.
COME ON.
UH, LET ME INTRODUCE YOU TO, UM, A COLLEAGUE, WHO WORKS WITH ME, AT THE OFFICE...
AND, UH, THIS ONE...

OR IS IT OTHER WAY AROUND?
PHILIP.
OOH!

HOW YOU DOING MAN?
FRIENDS OF VICKY'S?
BRIDESMAIDS?
AW, COME ON, MAN.
I'M S-SELLING, YOU KNOW?
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
WHAT?
IT'S NOT LIKE I DON'T LOVE MY LITTLE VICKY, MAN.
I LOVE HER MADLY!
YOU KNOW THAT.
ALRIGHT?
IT'S NOT LIKE I HATE ALL THE OTHER WOMEN IN THE WORLD, MAN.
RIGHT.
ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT, RELAX.
THERE'S SOMETHING I WANNA SHOW YOU.
LET'S GO GET MARTY AND LUKE.
CHRIS?
GENTLEMEN!
WELCOME TO THE LOFT.
WOW, THIS IS IMPRESSIVE, VINCE!
CHECK OUT THE VIEW.
THEN, IMAGINE THAT THIS IS OUR OWN PRIVATE OASIS, RIGHT IN THE HEART DOWNTOWN.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
A PLACE WHERE NO ONE HASSLES YOU.
A PLACE YOU CAN ESCAPE TO, ANY TIME YOU WANT.
OK, SO, THIS YOUR LOFT?
NO, IT'S OURS...
IF YOU WANT IT.
WHAT?
OURS?
THINK ABOUT IT.
NO MESSY HOTEL BILLS, NO...
QUESTIONABLE CREDIT CARD ACTIVITY.
THIS WOULD BE OUR SECRET PLACE.
TO STEAL AWAY,
DISCREETLY AND ECONOMICALLY, IN THESE...
CHALLENGING TIMES.
FIVE WAY SPLIT.
WHAT DO YOU THINK?
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M NOT LIKE THAT.
COME ON, CHRIS.
WE'RE MEN.
WE'RE ALL A LITTLE LIKE THAT.
YEAH, TELL ME ABOUT IT.
GIVE ME YOUR KEY RIGHT NOW, BRING YOUR TWINS UP HERE,
GIVE 'EM A LITTLE PRIVATE TOUR.
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY COST, MARTY?
HOW MUCH?
I MIGHT HAVE IT ON ME, RIGHT NOW.
SERIOUSLY.
THINK ABOUT IT.
IT'S A GREAT INVESTMENT.
A ONCE IN A LIFETIME GOLDEN OPPORTUNITY.
I CAN'T STAY HERE.
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?
LUKE?
YOU CANNOT FREAK OUT, RIGHT NOW.
WE HAVE TO STAY TOGETHER, LIKE WE SAID.
ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT.
LUKE, YOU JUST CALM THE FUCK DOWN.
NO, NO!
IT'S OVER, VINCENT.
IT'S ALL GONNA COME OUT!
IT'S NOT OVER.
LISTEN!
WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE AND WE GONNA FIX IT.
OK?
TRY PHIL AGAIN.
THIS IS PHILIP.
PLEASE LEAVE A MESSAGE AFTER THE TONE.
WHAT IF HE DOESN'T SHOW?
WE NEED TO BE OUT OF THE COUNTRY BY...
HE'LL SHOW.
YOU CAN'T COVER HIM, CHRIS.
NOT THIS TIME.
GUYS, LOOK AT THIS.
WHAT'S IT MEAN?
WHAT DOES IT MEAN?
DO YOU KNOW LATIN, DOCTOR?
EXCUSE ME?
LATIN, DO YOU KNOW LATIN?
I TOOK IT PRE-MED, YEAH.
WHAT'S IT SAY ON THE WALL, THERE?
FATUM NOS IUNGEBIT.
FATUM NOS IUNGEBIT?
I CAN READ THAT.
WHAT'S IT MEAN?
I'M GUESSING YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT IT MEANS.
NO, WE WOULD LIKE TO HEAR YOU SAY IT.
YOU'D LIKE TO HEAR ME SAY IT?
OK.
FATUM NOS IUNGEBIT, UH...
FATE WILL UNITE US.
NOW, ALL I CAN POSSIBLY THINK, IS THAT SOMEBODY, WHO KNOWS LATIN, LIKE YOU...
REACHED OVER, WITH THIS YOUNG LADY'S HAND, AND WROTE FATUM NOS IUNGEBIT ON THE WALL.
FATUM NOS IUNGEBIT IS WRONG.
HOW SO, DOCTOR?
THE FUTURE IMPERFECT TENSE.
THE VERB, UNITE, IUNGERE IS NOT IUNGEBIT.
IT'S IUNGET.
IT SHOULD SAY FATUM NOS IUNGET.
SO, THE PERSON YOU'RE LOOKING FOR, MADE A CLASSIC LATIN ERROR.
I'M GUESSING YOU KNEW THAT ALREADY, TOO.
DIDN'T YOU?
KNOW THE PHRASE, "FUCK YOU"?
GERMANIC ORIGIN.
WHERE'S YOUR BROTHER?
I'M SORRY, I CAN'T HELP YOU WITH THAT ONE.
RIGHT.
WELL, ACTUALLY, HE'S YOUR HALF BROTHER, ISN'T HE?
SAME MOTHER, DIFFERENT FATHERS?
HE SPENT SOME TIME IN VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS, WITH YOUR HALF-SISTER, ZOE.
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
AFTER OUR MOTHER DIED, UM...
PHILIP WASN'T...
WASN'T AS LUCKY WITH HIS FATHER.
APPARENTLY, NOT.
ALCOHOLIC CHILD BEATER.
MMM.
YOU DIDN'T SPEND MUCH TIME WITH PHILIP BACK THEN, DID YOU?
NO.
BUT NOW, YOU'RE BEST FRIENDS?
WELL, WE'VE HAD A LOT OF CATCHING UP TO DO.
YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW WHERE WE CAN FIND HIM?
FATE WILL UNITE US?
WHERE THE HELL'S YOUR BROTHER, CHRIS?
I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?
WHERE THE FUCK IS PHILIP?
I'M RIGHT HERE.
NOW, WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?
YOU DID THIS.
YOU DID THIS!
LUKE, LUKE, LUKE!
LUKE!
COME HERE, HEY, HEY!
HANDS OFF ME!
BRING IT ON!
WHAT IS THIS?
LUKE!
DID YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUCK YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT!
JUST ANSWER THE FUCKING QUESTION!
DID YOU DO THIS?
OF COURSE NOT!
JESUS CHRIST!
WERE YOU HERE LAST NIGHT?
NO, MAN.
I WASN'T HERE LAST NIGHT.
I SLEPT AT MY IN-LAWS.
YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME, CALL VICKY.
WHAT ABOUT THIS MORNING.
WERE YOU HERE THIS MORNING?
I WAS AT A PROJECT SITE, ALRIGHT?
WITH MY FATHER-IN-LAW.
MY GOD!
WHERE WERE YOU LAST NIGHT?
WHERE'VE YOU BEEN?
PHILIP, TAKE IT EASY.
BEFORE ACCUSING EVERYONE ELSE, WHERE'VE YOU BEEN?
'CAUSE I'VE
NEVER GOT A TEXT THAT'S SAYIN' THE LOFT WAS TAKEN.
NEVER..
LAST NIGHT, I WAS AT HOME.
CAN YOU PROVE IT?
NO, I CAN'T PROVE IT, BECAUSE BARBARA'S TAKEN THE KID SKIING.
YOU'LL HAVE TO TAKE MY WORD FOR IT!
ALRIGHT, GUYS!
COME ON, COME ON!
YOUR WORD?
!
THERE'S A DEAD WOMAN IN OUR LOFT...
THAT ONLY US HAVE ACCESS TO.
NOW, IF ANYBODY HAS ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS, NOW'S THE TIME TO SAY IT, RIGHT NOW.
THANK YOU, VERY MUCH.
WELL, PHILIP'S GOT A BALL AND CHAIN, NOW.
WHO WOULDA THUNK IT?
WHO'S THE FATHER-IN-LAW, AGAIN?
HIS NAME'S HIRAM FRY.
HE'S A...
HUGE PROPERTY DEVELOPER.
HIS FRIENDS CALL HIM, "THE MAN OF STEEL".
HE'S WORTH MILLIONS.
VICKY'S HIS ONLY DAUGHTER.
SO, WHAT'S NOT TO LOVE?
I JUST HOPE PHILIP WILL BE HAPPY.
WELL, THAT'S COZY.
COME ON.
EVER SINCE COUNCILMAN KOTKIN GOT ELECTED, MAN OF STEEL'S BEEN BUSY REBUILDING DOWNTOWN.
KOTKIN CAME TO YOUR OPENING, RIGHT?
YEAH, HE TURNED UP FOR A PHOTO-OP.
WHEN IT COMES TO HANDING OUT PERMITS AND CONTRACTS, THOUGH...
GAME'S RIGGED.
WAIT A MINUTE.
TELL ME WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, AGAIN?
'CAUSE I JUST SAW SOME MINI CHEESECAKES.
GORGEOUS, HUH?
I MEAN THIS...
WHOLE SETUP.
WHOEVER SAID MONEY CAN'T BUY HAPPINESS, SURE HASN'T LIVED THIS LIFE.
SORRY BOYS, YOU LOST YOUR BACHELOR MASCOT.
HE'S ALL MINE, NOW.
GOOD LUCK WITH BREAKING THIS BRONCO, VICKY.
GOD KNOWS, OTHERS HAVE TRIED.
BUT I'M NOT OTHERS, AM I, PHILIP?
HO, HO!
TOLD YOU!
AND IT'S NOT JUST ME.
PHILIP'S MARRIED INTO THE FRY FAMILY, NOW.
AS SOON AS WE'RE BACK FROM FIJI...
YEAH,
WELL, I'M GONNA SELL SOME PROPERTIES WITH VICKY'S DAD.
YOU KNOW, SEE HOW IT GRABS ME.
WOW!
GRABS YOU.
WELL, GUYS, THANKS FOR COMING.
CONGRATULATIONS.
I'LL BE WITH YOU IN A SECOND, BABY.
OH, MAN!
I NEED A BREAK FROM ALL THE ASS KISSING, MAN.
WHERE IS FIJI?
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
PHIL.
YOUR WEDDING PRESENT.
ARE YOU FOR REAL?
ABSOLUTELY!
DON'T LOSE IT.
THERE'S ONLY FIVE OF THESE IN EXISTENCE.
ACCEPTING A KEY TO THE LOFT, MEANS YOU ACCEPT RULES TO THE LOFT.
MARTY?
WHAT ARE YOU, CRAZY?
OUR WIVES ARE HERE.
DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S A BIT CYNICAL, HANDING THOSE THINGS OUT HERE?
CYNICAL?
IT'S JUST A KEY TO A ROOM.
YOU SHOULD CHECK IT OUT.
OH, NO, YOU'RE NOT LIKE THAT.
NOT NOW, MAYBE LATER.
WHAT ABOUT YOU, LUKE?
NOW, OR LATER?
COME ON.
ATTABOY!
WELL, YOU JUST MAKE SURE THIS DOESN'T BLOW UP IN YOUR FACES.
HOW'S IT GONNA BLOW UP IN OUR FACE?
IT'S JUST A ROOM.
LIKE VINCE SAID.
OUR ROOM.
NOW, WE KEEP IT TO OURSELVES, ALRIGHT?
TELL NOBODY.
JUST STAYS WITHIN OUR CIRCLE.
MARTY?
YEAH?
YEAH!
NOW YOU JUST NEED TO FIND SOMEONE WILLING TO GO WITH YOU, MARTY.
OH, YEAH?
YEAH, I THINK THERE'S, UH, PLENTY OF CHOICES, RIGHT HERE.
SOME OF THESE GUYS BRING SOME
PREMIUM GRADE, HIGH TEST PUSSY.
LIKE THAT LITTLE, DEWY-EYED VIXEN, RIGHT THERE.
SHE LOOKS UNDERAGE.
UH, SHE'S TWENTY.
IF ONE OF YOU MESSES WITH HER, I'M GONNA CRACK YOUR HEAD WIDE OPEN!
OH, WHAT, HAVE YOU GOT DIBS ON MISS CURLY LOCKS?
LISTEN, MAN.
THAT'S ZOE, ALRIGHT?
ZOE?
YEAH.
LIKE, AS IN SKIN AND BONES, TOMBOY, ZOE?
YEAH.
I HATE TO SAY IT, PHIL, BUT YOUR LITTLE SISTER IS SERIOUSLY HOT.
THANKS MAN.
SHE'S NOT LITTLE ANY MORE.
THAT IS THE FINEST PIECE OF ASS...
YO, MARTY, IT'S ENOUGH.
I'M JUST SAYING...
I WANT TO FUCK HER LIKE AN ANIMAL, YOU KNOW...
COME ON, MARTY, IT'S ENOUGH.
FEEL IT FROM THE INSIDE?
I WANNA FUCK YOU LIKE AN ANIMAL.
YOU'RE NOT SAYING ANOTHER WORD.
YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT MY SISTER, GOT IT?
YOU GOT IT?
FUCK!
YOU WATCH IT!
YOU WATCH IT.
KICK YOUR ASS AT YOUR OWN FUCKING WEDDING.
HI.
HI.
WE MET AT THE, UH, THE BUILDING OPENING.
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU'RE...
ANNE MORRIS.
I'M GLAD YOU REMEMBER ME, CHRIS.
MMM.
I SEE YOU WORK WEEKENDS.
WHAT A DEDICATED PERSONAL ASSISTANT.
WHAT A LUCKY CITY COUNCILMAN.
HAH!
SCREW HIM.
DO YOU?
DOES IT GET A BIT BORING, WALKING AROUND ALL THESE PARTIES BY YOURSELF?
HE WANTS YOU CLOSE, BUT NOT TOO CLOSE.
NOT WHEN THERE'S IMPORTANT PEOPLE AROUND.
I TOLD YOU.
I FALL FOR THE WRONG MEN.
CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET?
OUR CITY COUNCILMAN LIKES TO KEEP MY PANTIES WITH HIM, AT THESE EVENTS, IN HIS POCKET.
IT'S A TURN-ON FOR HIM.
THE THOUGHT OF ME IN A CROWD, SO NAKED...
ONLY HE KNOWS.
WHY DO YOU LET HIM USE YOU LIKE THAT?
WHO SAYS HE'S USING ME?
MAYBE...
IT TURNS ME ON.
MAYBE, ME TELLING YOU ABOUT IT, TURNS ME ON, EVEN MORE...
I HOPE YOU DON'T CATCH COLD.
CHRIS.
CHRIS, I'M SORRY.
I-I...
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE I-I WAS TESTING YOU.
I DON'T NEED TO BE TESTED.
LISTEN, DO YOU WANT...
MAYBE GET A CUP OF COFFEE...
SOMEPLACE QUIET...
PRIVATE?
I'D LIKE TO USE YOUR KEY.
JUST ONCE.
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK.
HEY, IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT I THINK.
HAVE FUN.
DOES EVERYONE STILL HAVE A KEY?
OF COURSE WE DO.
IT'S CRUCIAL WE GET THIS RIGHT.
FIVE KEYS WERE CUT.
TO MAKE A SIXTH, YOU'D NEED THE CODE, WHICH IS IN MY SAFE.
SO, WE CAN RULE THAT OUT.
BUT THERE WAS NO BREAK-IN, SO DOES EVERYONE STILL HAVE A KEY?
WHAT, YOU THINK WE'VE BEEN GIVING AWAY OUR KEYS?
IT'S AGAINST YOUR RULES, VINCE.
THEN, SHOW ME.
WELL, WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO PROVE HERE?
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE SOMEONE'S LOST A KEY.
OK?
LET-LET'S JUST RULE THAT OUT.
OK?
LOOK.
HERE'S MINE.
ALRIGHT?
CHRIS?
YOU DIDN'T USE A KEY TO GET IN, JUST THEN.
NO.
I DIDN'T BRING IT.
WHERE IS IT?
I DON'T HAVE IT ON ME, OK?
IT'S NOT LIKE I NEED IT EVERY DAY, LIKE SOME OF YOU GUYS.
BUT YOU DO STILL HAVE IT?
VINCENT,
WHETHER OR NOT I HAVE MY KEY ON ME, RIGHT NOW, IS REALLY NOT IMPORTANT.
IT'S EXTREMELY FUCKING IMPORTANT.
SOMEONE GOT IN USING A KEY AND YOURS IS MISSING.
IS THAT RIGHT VINCENT?
THEN HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT THE ALARM WAS SHUT OFF?
SO, LET'S JUST CUT THE BULLSHIT, 'CAUSE IT DEFINITELY HAD TO BE ONE OF US FIVE.
UNLESS...
UNLESS WHAT?
UNLESS SHE LET HIM IN.
OH, YEAH?
THEN HOW'D SHE GET IN, VINCENT?
ANY WAY YOU LOOK AT IT, IT KEEPS COMING BACK DOWN TO US,
AND I, FOR ONE, WOULD LIKE TO KNOW, WHO'S HIDING SOMETHING?
IS THERE A WORD FOR THAT?
YES, POLYAMORY.
IT'S A...
PHILOSOPHY, SOME SORT OF BELIEF SYSTEM ABOUT BEING ROMANTICALLY
INVOLVED WITH MORE THAN ONE PERSON, AT THE SAME TIME.
UH, HUH.
AND YOUR BOSS GET AWAY WITH THAT?
YES, HE SAYS THAT HE'S IN LOVE WITH HIS WIFE AND HIS GIRLFRIEND, SO WHY SHOULD HE HAVE TO CHOOSE?
UH, HUH.
AND HIS WIFE IS AMAZINGLY COOL WITH IT.
OH, REALLY?
IS SHE SPECIAL NEEDS?
MAYBE OXYGEN DEPRIVED?
WHAT?
EXPLAIN.
I'D LIKE TO KNOW.
IT SOUNDS LIKE MY KIND OF PHILOSOPHY, BARBARA.
WHAT'S IT CALLED AGAIN?
POLYANNEMARIE?
PLEASE, SPARE US, CHUBBS.
YOU CAN BARELY HANDLE ONE WOMAN.
WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH TWO?
HMMM.
MARRY ONE.
I WOULD MAKE UP SOMETHING.
SOME SORT OF GAME THAT INVOLVES TWO LADIES AND ONE GUY.
START A TRAPEZE ACT, OR SOMETHING.
COULD YOU AT LEAST FAKE SOME ENTHUSIASM?
IT'S YOUR PARTY.
ANYWAY, I'M COOKING.
YOU ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO INVITE YOUR FRIENDS OVER, COULD YOU AT LEAST TRY AND MAKE IT HOME IN TIME?
THEY'RE NEVER HERE, OK?
WILL YOU JUST JOIN US?
I JUST HOPE THE PUDGY CLOWN DOESN'T PUKE ON THE RUG.
HE'S BEEN CHUGGING VODKA LIKE IT'S EVIAN.
I MEAN, DOESN'T HIS WIFE SEE THAT?
ACTUALLY, SHE WAS JUST COOL WITH IT LONG ENOUGH TO CATCH HIM IN THE ACT.
SHE HIRED A DETECTIVE.
CELLPHONE RECORDS, CREDIT CARD RECEIPTS, AUDIO, VIDEO, THE WORKS.
AND, IN A HEARTBEAT, MY POOR BOSS WENT FROM POLYAMORY TO ALIMONY.
MAN, YOUR BOSS SOUNDS MENTALLY RETARDED.
SO, WHAT-WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?
OH, UH...
HE AND HIS CONCUBINE ARE NOW CRAMPED IN A TINY ONE BEDROOM CONDO...
BUT, I'M GUESSING HE'S HAPPY.
SHE'S BLONDE, 23, WITH A BRAND NEW PAIR OF FAKE BREASTS.
HOW CAN MEN STAND FAKE BREASTS?
WHY ARE WOMEN ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT FAKE TITS THIS, FAKE TITS THAT?
I MEAN, LISTEN, GIRLS, IF IT'S A DECENT BOOB JOB, WHO FUCKING CARES, YOU KNOW?
MY MOM...
MY MOM, SHE'S GOT, UH...
FALSE TEETH, OK?
WHEN SHE SMILES, DO PEOPLE GIVE HER SHIT AND SAY, "OH, MY GOD!
LOOK!
FAKE!"
NO, THEY DON'T, THEY SAY, "WOW!
YOU LOOK WAY BETTER, NOW.
IT'S AN IMPROVEMENT."
YOU KNOW, YOU WOMEN, YOU'RE SO CATTY, SO COMPETITIVE.
CALM DOWN, TUBBY, DEAREST...
NO, NO.
YOU KNOW WHAT, NO?
IT'S NOTHING-NOTHING TO CALM ABOUT, MIMI.
I MEAN, A GLORIOUS BIG SETUP, FUCKING TITS AND A NICE
PIECE OF ASS.
IT'S-IT'S-IT'S THRILLING.
IT'S THRILLING.
THIS IS ALL...
A LITTLE TOO HIGHBROW FOR MY TEENY, TINY, CATTY...
FEMALE MIND.
OH, WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU SHOULD HAVE THAT ENLARGED.
HUH?
AND WHILE YOU'RE UNDER, YOU SHOULD HAVE THE CORNERS OF YOUR MOUTH LIFTED
SO YOU CAN SMILE EVERY ONCE IN AWHILE.
SORRY.
SORRY, CHRIS!
MARTY?
MARTY, COME ON!
WHAT?
WHAT?
NO.
NO, YOU'RE CLASS ACT, MARTY.
MIMI, WOULD YOU LIKE TO GET YOUR HUSBAND ANOTHER DRINK, OR SHOULD I, DO THE HONORS?
YOU SHOULD DO IT, AND I WANT IT CHILLED...
AND THEN YOU GO WITH HER AND STIR...
HONEY....
THE PROBLEM WITH YOUR BOSS, BARBARA, IS HE DIDN'T HAVE HIS SHIT TOGETHER.
I MEAN, APART, PART, I MEAN, HE DIDN'T, NO, I MEAN HE DIDN'T COMPARTMENTALIZE.
DO YOU GUYS AGREE?
ALRIGHT, MARTY.
HOW WOULD YOU COMPARTMENTALIZE?
HOW?
OK, WELL, SINCE YOU ASK.
FIRST THING FIRST IS, I WOULDN'T HAVE A PLACE THAT YOU COULD GET CAUGHT.
NOT A HOTEL, NOT YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S CRIB.
IT'S KEY, RIGHT?
AM I RIGHT?
VINNY, BOY.
AM I RIGHT?
MARTY, YOU'VE-YOU'VE LOST US ALL.
I DOUBT THAT.
I DOUBT THAT, VINNY BOY.
IT'S, OK.
FIRST OF ALL, SORRY, BABY, I WOULD JUST GET A LITTLE,
YOU KNOW, A LITTLE ONE BEDROOM CONDO, OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
OH, YOU ALRIGHT?
MIMI, YOUR HUSBAND TENDS TO TALK OUT HIS ASS WHEN HE'S BEEN DRINKING, YEAH?
ALRIGHT, THERE WE GO.
HONEY, WOULD YOU GIVE ME A HAND?
SURE.
SORRY, DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE IN HERE.
YEAH, NO PROBLEM.
HEY, TOO MUCH, TOO FAST, I GUESS.
THAI FOOD, YOU KNOW.
YEAH, IT GETS ALL UP IN YOUR NOSE AND SHIT.
YEAH, IT'S A LITTLE SPICY.
YEAH.
I'M OUTTA HERE.
BOY.
I NEED TO PICK UP SOME MORE INSULIN.
LUKE...
IS THERE SOMETHING YOU WANNA TELL ME?
ARE YOU KEEPING SECRETS?
WHAT KIND OF SECRETS?
IS THERE SOMEONE ELSE?
I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU START ASKING ME SILLY QUESTIONS, BUT THE ANSWER IS NO.
I'M NOT CHEATING ON YOU, HONEY.
IT'S NOT WHY I'M ASKING, LUKE.
I'M ASKING IF THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE.
LISTEN, SWEETIE.
WHATEVER I MAY BE, OR MAY NOT BE, AND...
I KNOW I'M NOT AS GLAMOROUS AS SOME.
BUT I'LL ALWAYS BE THERE FOR YOU...
AND THE CHILDREN.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO WITHOUT YOU.
I WANT YOU TO KNOW...
THERE'S A LOT I COULD PUT UP WITH...
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I NEED TO GET HER OUT OF HERE.
HOW?
SHE IS SHACKLED TO THE BED!
CAN'T YOU GUYS SEE WHAT'S GOING ON?
SOMEONE IS TRYING TO FRAME US.
WHO?
WHO WANTS TO FRAME US?
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT THINK ABOUT IT.
THE BODY'S CUFFED TO THE BED.
IT'S POSSIBLE TO MOVE.
THE LATIN.
THE KNIFE.
SOMEONE DID THIS FOR A REASON.
HELL, THE COPS COULD BE HERE ANY SECOND.
YEAH, BUT NONE OF US KNOW WHO THIS GIRL IS.
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW SHE GOT IN HERE.
WHO ELSE KNEW ABOUT THE ARRANGEMENT?
WHO ELSE KNOWS ABOUT OUR ARRANGEMENT?
DID ANYONE BLAB?
TELL ONE OF THE GIRLS THAT HAVE BEEN UP HERE?
MARTY?
WHAT?
WHY ME?
IT WAS SOME NIGHT YOU WERE HAMMERED, MAYBE.
I'VE ALWAYS FOLLOWED THE RULES, VINCENT.
DID YOU GIVE ANYONE YOUR CODE.
DID YOU-DID YOU KEY IN, WHILE SOMEONE WAS WATCHING?
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
I JUST TOLD YOU.
ALRIGHT, WAIT!
WHAT'S YOUR POINT, VINCENT?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING WITH THIS?
SOMEONE IS TRYING TO SET US UP.
LIKE WHO?
I DON'T KNOW.
A-A REJECTED GIRLFRIEND.
A JEALOUS BOYFRIEND, BETRAYED HUSBAND.
SOMEONE WITH A MOTIVE.
LOOK, IS ONE OF YOU GUYS IN SOME KIND OF TROUBLE?
I THINK I MAY BE FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOU.
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY THAT.
NO, BUT, I MEAN IT.
WHY WOULD SAY THAT, CHRIS?
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN FEEL IT?
I'VE NEVER CHEATED ON MY WIFE BEFORE...
AND I DON'T FALL IN LOVE EASILY.
CHRIS, I DON'T WANT YOU TO LOVE ME.
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ME.
APART FROM THESE STOLEN MOMENTS...
THEY'RE EXCITING, YEAH, SURE, BUT...
THEY'RE JUST MOMENTS.
LET'S CHANGE THAT.
I WANNA SEE YOU MORE OFTEN.
CHRIS, PLEASE.
NOT JUST FOR THIS.
NO.
STOP IT.
I...
I DON'T WANT YOU TO LOVE ME.
WELL, I DON'T WANNA KEEP SNEAKING AROUND.
I'M GONNA TELL ALLISON ABOUT US.
NO, YOU'RE NOT.
YES, I AM.
ANNE!
I'M GONNA LEAVE HER.
STOP IT.
WHY YOU DOING THIS?
THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE...
THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN HURT YOU.
I WOULD NEVER HURT YOU, ANNE.
STOP.
STOP WHAT?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
WOULD YOU...
STOP IT, OK?
YOU DON'T KNOW ME, OK?
THAT'S THE END OF IT.
NO.
WELL, WOULD YOU GIVE ME A CHANCE, AT LEAST...
I'M A WHORE...
ALRIGHT?
WHAT?
I'M A PROSTITUTE.
I FUCK MEN FOR MONEY.
DO YOU GET IT NOW?
DON'T WORRY, DOCTOR, I WON'T BILL YOU FOR THE PAST
FEW MONTHS.
PLEASE, ANNE, WOULD YOU WAIT, WOULD YOU...
CHRIS...
WOULD YOU WAIT A MINUTE?
PLEASE STOP IT.
YOU DON'T KNOW HALF OF IT, ALRIGHT?
JUST GO HOME.
GO HOME TO YOUR WIFE AND YOUR KIDS.
IS YOUR FRIEND, CHRIS VANOWEN, CHEATING ON HIS WIFE, MR. LANDRY?
OH, I-I DOUBT THAT.
CHRIS IS A VERY DEVOTED HUSBAND AND, UM....
AND A MODEL DAD...
JUST LIKE ALL THE REST OF YOUR PALS, RIGHT?
EXCEPT FOR YOU, YOU'RE NOT EXACTLTY SQUEAKY CLEAN, ARE YOU, MARTY?
UM, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.
WHY DOES YOUR WIFE WANT A DIVORCE?
DIVORCE IS NOT THE RIGHT...
WHAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH...
A SEPARATION.
IT'S A TRIAL SEPARATION.
WHY?
UH, BECAUSE SHE FOUND OUT SOMETHING THAT SHE, UH, WASN'T TOO HAPPY ABOUT.
YOU FUCKED AROUND ON HER?
IF YOU WANNA BE TECHNICAL.
HOW'D SHE FIND OUT?
THE WOMAN WITH WHOM I...
FUCKED AROUND?
YEAH.
APPARENTLY EXPECTED SOMETHING A LITTLE MORE, AND SHE SHOWED UP ON OUR FRONT PORCH.
BITCH STARTED THE...
WOMAN, IN QUESTION, STARTED SAYING THINGS.
AND MY ONLY HOPE IS THAT MIMI WILL COME AROUND, EVENTUALLY, BECAUSE I LOVE HER VERY MUCH.
DID YOU GO, WITH THIS WOMAN, TO THE LOFT?
WHAT?
NO.
THIS HAPPENED IN SAN DIEGO.
WELL, THAT'S WHERE YOU MET THE WOMAN, RIGHT?
IN SAN DIEGO?
YEAH.
WHY YOU WERE THERE?
A COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE CONVENTION.
VINCE HAD A COUPLE EXTRA TICKETS, A VIP THING.
YOU KNOW, IT'S...
A COUPLE NIGHTS IN A FANCY HOTEL AND CHANCE TO GET AWAY FOR A COUPLE DAYS.
AND NIGHTS.
YEAH, NIGHTS, TOO.
MAN, YOU SEE THAT?
JESUS, VINCE, THOSE GIRLS ARE DROOLING ALL OVER YOU.
INVITE 'EM OVER.
I GOT FIRST DIBS.
I'LL BE HAPPY WITH SECOND BEST, TOO.
I DON'T TAKE A RAINCHECK ON THAT.
WHAT?
ARE YOU FUCKING CRAZY?
WHY WOULDN'T YOU INVITE THEM OVER?
'CAUSE, MARTY, I'D RATHER DIE FOR SOME RARE AND EXOTIC SEA CREATURE, THAN SHOOT FISH, IN A BARREL.
DOES BARBARA KNOW ABOUT THESE DEEP SEA EXPEDITIONS OF YOURS?
WHAT, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
YEAH!
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM, SEACORD?
I MEAN, YOU'VE GOT A KEY TO THE LOFT.
WHAT DO YOU DO UP THERE?
LAUNDRY?
DISHES?
HEY, ARE YOU GUYS HERE ON BUSINESS, OR WHAT?
I'M DANA.
MY FIRST TIME HERE.
IT'S A LITTLE OVER PRICED, FOR WHAT YOU GET.
DON'T YOU THINK?
HI, DANA, I'M VINCENT.
THIS IS, UH, MARTY, LUKE.
CAN WE, UH...
BUY YOU A DRINK?
HEY, WHEN I SAID OVER PRICED I WASN'T TROLLING FOR FREE BOOZE!
NO-NO.
I MEAN, I DIDN'T SAY...
WELL, SINCE YOU ASKED, WHAT'RE YOU DRINKING?
OHHH, CHAMPAGNE.
A GIRL CAN DREAM...
CHAMPAGNE?
PLEASE.
ALRIGHT, ONE CHAMPAGNE COMING UP.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
THE FAT CHICKS CAN SCARE OFF ALL THE HOT CHICKS.
MARTY, EVERY FAT CHICK HAS A GOOD LOOKING FRIEND.
HERS IS PROBABLY ON HER WAY DOWN, RIGHT NOW.
OK.
YEAH, WELL, WHAT IF SHE IS THE GOOD LOOKING FRIEND, AND THE REALLY FAT CHICK'S ON HER WAY DOWN?
I THINK THAT'S PHILIP'S FATHER-IN-LAW.
OH, YEAH, IT IS.
I'LL BE!
THAT'S THE MAN OF STEEL, ALRIGHT.
THAT AIN'T MRS. STEEL.
THINK WE SHOULD GIVE HIM A KEY?
MAYBE.
NOT MINE.
I'D LIKE A BOTTLE OF YOUR FINEST CHAMPAGNE, AND FOUR GLASSES, PLEASE, FOR THE TABLE IN THE CORNER.
YOU, UH...
WERE AT MY DAUGHTER'S WEDDING.
PHILIP'S FRIENDS.
YOU'RE THE ARCHITECT.
VINCENT STEVENS.
WE SHOULD TALK SOMETIME, MR. STEVENS.
SURE.
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT IN MIND, MR. FRY?
WE HAVE A NEW WATERFRONT PROJECT.
IT'S MASSIVE, IT'S...
CUTTING EDGE.
IT MIGHT BE RIGHT UP YOUR ALLEY.
OF COURSE, IT'S ALL PRELIMINARY.
WE HAVE TO KEEP IT UNDER WRAPS.
I HOPE YOU CAN BE DISCRETE.
SURE.
DISCRETION, MR. STEVENS, THAT'S THE MAIN THING.
DICTUM SAPIENTI SAT EST.
A WORD TO THE WISE.
YOU ARE WISE?
YEAH, SURE!
WISE, UH...
WISE AND DISCRETE, MR. FRY.
I'M IN SOFTWARE.
I CAN BE DISCRETE, MYSELF, AT ONCE.
I'LL PICK UP THEIR TAB, AS WELL.
HAVE A NICE EVENING, GENTLEMEN.
SWEETHEART?
SWEETHEART.
EXCUSE ME.
HI!
THIS IS ANNE.
LEAVE A MESSAGE.
WHO ARE YOU CALLING AT THIS HOUR?
WELL, I'M JUST...
CHECKING MY VOICEMAIL.
AND WHAT DOES YOUR VOICEMAIL SAY?
THAT YOU'RE A LOUSY LIAR, CHRIS VANOWEN?
WHAT ARE YOU TALK...?
SOMETHING WRONG?
YOU TELL ME, CHRIS.
ALLISON, I...
I'M GOING TO BED.
ALLISON!
EXCUSE ME, THIS IS NOT THINKING.
IT'S CALLED FOLLOWING YOUR DICK AROUND.
HEY, TWO KINDS OF ARTICLES, IN COSMO, MONTH AFTER MONTH.
ONE:
MEN ARE PIGS.
TWO:
HOW DO I SEDUCE A PIG TO TRY MY WOOD?
I DON'T READ COSMO, MONTH AFTER MONTH!
WELL, I DO.
I DON'T!
WELL, I DO.
AND I FIND IT STRANGELY...
YOU KNOW WHAT I FIND STRANGELY COMPELLING?
GRAB ASS.
HUH!
CAN'T LEAVE YOU ALONE FOR A MINUTE?
SARAH!
IT'S BEEN MORE LIKE AN HOUR.
YOU'D THINK I'D HAVE BEEN SUBSIDIZED.
AREN'T YOU GOING TO INTRODUCE ME TO YOUR NEW FRIENDS?
AND THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME YOU MET HER?
YEAH, THAT WAS, UH...
THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME.
SARAH?
YEAH.
HER NAME WAS SARAH.
MR. STEVENS, WHAT ELSE HAPPENED IN SAN DIEGO?
WHAT DO YOU WANNA KNOW?
EVERYTHING.
KEEP IT DOWN, KEEP IT DOWN.
THIS IS INSANE, SARAH.
YOU SHOULD NEVER DARE A CRAZY WOMAN.
VINCENT, WE SHOULD PROBABLY GO BACK.
WE'RE QUIET ENOUGH, IT'S OK.
MMM!
HMM.
SORRY, DON'T USE THE POOL.
NOW YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR END OF THE BARGAIN.
COME OVER HERE.
THAT'S BETTER.
YEAH...
OH, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA!
COME ON, DON'T KEEP US WAITING.
TAKE IT OFF.
I'M GONNA BE SICK.
WHAT?
VINCE'S BODY'S
NOT THAT BAD!
NOT VINCE!
SHRIMP COCKTAIL!
WHAT?
!
DANA...
DANA!
COME-COME BACK...
COME BACK HERE.
YOUR TURN.
TAKE IT ALL OFF.
NOT BAD.
IS THIS STILL TOO SCARY FOR YOU, LUKE?
ARE YOU GONNA JOIN US?
I'M-I'M FINE, RIGHT HERE.
I NEED YOU, 'CAUSE VINCENT'S GONNA TRY AND MAKE A MOVE ON ME, SOON, AND...
IF YOU'RE HERE, MAYBE HE WON'T DARE.
OR MAYBE VINCENT'S NOT INTERESTED.
MAYBE VINCENT'D RATHER DO LAPS.
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN THE LAST FEW HOURS OF CASUAL, BUT MEANINGFUL,
GLANCES THAT EACH LASTED A SECOND TOO LONG.
YOU LIKE TO PLAY GAMES, HUH?
I DO.
AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE.
I'M BETTER AT IT THAN YOU.
CAN YOU FEEL ME?
MOST DEFINITELY.
MARTY?
MARTY, I NEED MY ROOM KEY.
OH, DUDE!
KINDA BUSY HERE!
DON'T STOP!
GO!
GO!
SHIT!
YOU'RE SCARED, IS WHAT IT IS.
YOU'RE RUNNING AWAY FROM YOUR FEELINGS.
I WANT TO SAY GOODBYE.
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT IT'S LIKE TO REALLY LOVE SOMEONE?
I'M SORRY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
THROW IT AWAY.
IT'S EMPTY.
YOU WERE HERE YESTERDAY...
WEREN'T YOU?
GUYS...
WE GOTTA GO TO THE COPS.
WE'RE NOT GETTING ANYWHERE WITH THIS.
CHRIS, I THINK VINCENT HAS SOMETHING TO TELL YOU.
ALRIGHT, LET'S HEAR IT.
HELLO?
WHO IS IT?
WHO IS IT?
IT'S A REALTOR, WHO WANTS TO COME UP.
SOMEBODY'S LISTED THE LOFT FOR SALE?
WHAT?
!
OH, JESUS FUCKING...
LISTED THE LOFT?
SHE SAYS SHE HAS AN APPOINTMENT WITH A DEAKINS?
SARAH DEAKINS?
WHO-WHO'S SARAH DEAKINS?
WAIT...
WHO THE HELL IS TRYING TO SELL OUR LOFT?
YOU KNOW HER, MARTY.
WHAT?
YOU KNOW HER, AND SO DOES LUKE.
SARAH DEAKINS IS LYING ON THE BED.
HEY GUYS, I-I PROMISE, I HAVE NEVER SEEN A SARAH DEAKINS.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
YOU KNOW HER.
WHY DO YOU KEEP SAYING THAT?
YOU MET HER, IN SAN DIEGO.
THE LAST NIGHT, IN THE BAR, REMEMBER?
DANA'S FRIEND.
THE LAST NIGHT I-I WAS WASTED OUT OF MY MIND.
THE WHOLE NIGHT'S A BLUR.
JESUS!
LUKE, YOU...
YOU REMEMBER HER, DON'T YOU?
THAT'S SARAH?
YOU REMEMBER, SARAH?
YOU-YOU REMEMBER HER, RIGHT?
YES, I-I REMEMBER SARAH.
BUT HOW-HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT'S SARAH?
COME ON, GUYS, WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?
YOU GUYS TURNED HER OVER AND LOOKED AT HER FACE, I DID NOT.
YEAH, I THINK THERE'S BEEN A MISTAKE.
WE DON'T KNOW ANYONE NAMED SARAH DEAKINS.
ALRIGHT, COME ON.
WHO IS IT?
DO WE KNOW HER?
I DON'T KNOW.
FUCK!
SO, IS THAT ALL YOU WANNA TELL US, VINCE?
OR IS THERE MORE?
I HAD A, THING...
WITH HER.
I BROUGHT HER UP HERE A COUPLE OF TIMES.
BUT I SWEAR ON MY KIDS, I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.
WILL YOU JUST FUCKING TELL ME?
WERE YOU HERE WITH HER LAST NIGHT?
WERE YOU THE ONE WHO LET HER IN?
I BROKE UP WITH HER LAST NIGHT.
I SWEAR, SHE WAS ALIVE, WHEN I LEFT.
IT STILL DOESN'T EXPLAIN WHY SOMEONE LISTED THE LOFT!
SOMETHING SPECIAL, OR JUST BROWSING?
WHY DON'T YOU RETURN MY PHONE CALLS?
IF YOU'RE DUMPING ME, AT LEAST HAVE THE DECENCY...
CHRIS, HOW CAN I DUMP YOU?
THERE'S NOTHING BETWEEN US.
THAT'S WHAT IT MEANT TO YOU?
NOTHING.
DID YOU FORGET WHAT I TOLD YOU, ALREADY?
WHO I AM?
WHAT I DO?
NO, I HAVEN'T.
IT DOESN'T CHANGE HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU.
HOW MANY WOMEN HAVE YOU TAKEN TO THAT THAT FUCK PAD YOU SHARE WITH YOUR FOUR LITTLE BUDDIES?
WHAT?
PLEASE, CHRIS...
SAVE IT FOR SOME GIRL WHO'LL ACTUALLY BUY YOUR BULLSHIT.
NO, NO, WAIT, WAIT.
YOU KNOW I'M NOT LIKE THAT.
HERE.
I ONLY NEED THIS IF I'M WITH YOU.
SO YOU KEEP IT.
IF YOU WANNA SEE ME AGAIN, YOU LET ME KNOW.
CHRIS?
OH!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
SHOPPING FOR ALLISON?
UHH, NO, NO, UM, I WAS JUST...
HERE WITH A COLLEAGUE.
DOES YOUR WIFE KNOW YOU'VE BEEN SHARING A LOFT, WITH YOUR PALS?
I ALREADY TOLD YOU, I'M NOT SHARING A LOFT WITH ANY PALS.
I WAS THERE, JUST ONCE, AT A PARTY, WHEN THE BUILDING FIRST OPENED.
THEN, YOU HAVE BEEN THERE!
A MINUTE AGO, YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHERE THE BUILDING WAS.
I NEVER TOOK ANYONE UP THERE.
I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT YOU MEANT.
WELL, DID YOU KNOW THE GIRL?
WE MET ONCE, IN SAN DIEGO.
ARE YOU AWARE THAT MR. STEVENS BEGAN A RELATIONSHIP WITH HER IN SAN DIEGO?
THAT WOULD SURPRISE ME, FRANKLY.
YOU DIDN'T KNOW.
ISN'T VINCENT STEVENS YOUR BEST FRIEND?
IT'S SO OBVIOUS, WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE.
YOU'RE TRYING TO TURN US AGAINST EACH OTHER.
BUT GUESS WHAT?
I'M NOT ABOUT TO START TRASHING MY FRIEND.
IS IT POSSIBLE, MR. SEACORD, THAT YOU WERE JEALOUS OF YOU BEST FRIEND?
I MEAN, HE'S NAILING ALL THESE BEAUTIFUL WOMEN...
I AM A MARRIED MAN.
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN NAILING WOMEN.
I'M NOT JEALOUS OF VINCENT.
OH, NO...
I DIDN'T MEAN, JEALOUS OF HIM, MR. SEACORD.
I MEANT, JEALOUS OF THE WOMEN.
WHERE DO YOU GET OFF...
WITH AN INUENDO LIKE THAT?
FUCKING BASTARDS.
WHY SO ANGRY, MR. SEACORD?
VINCENT IS MY CLOSEST FRIEND, AND HE HAS BEEN FOR YEARS.
YEAH, FINE.
BUT YOUR BEST FRIEND IS SELLING YOU OUT, AS WE SPEAK, MR. SEACORD.
YOU AND THE REST OF YOUR GANG.
NO, VINCENT WOULD NEVER SELL OUT HIS FRIENDS, AND YOU'RE FULL OF SHIT, ASSHOLE.
WHAT YOU CALL ME?
YOU HEARD ME, YOU LYING PIECE OF SHIT!
LOOK, I BROKE UP WITH HER AND I LEFT, THAT'S IT.
YEAH?
AFTER YOU CUT HER UP WITH THIS, RIGHT?
PUT THE KNIFE DOWN.
PHILIP!
PUT THE KNIFE...
PUT THE KNIFE DOWN.
BACK OFF.
THE LOFT IS LISTED IN HER NAME.
THAT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE.
SOMEONE'S TRYING TO PIN THIS ON US.
ON YOU, YOU MEAN!
JESUS!
GET A FUCKING GRIP!
FUCK!
GUYS, WE CANNOT KEEP DOING THIS.
WELL, WHAT DO YOU WANNA DO, MARTY?
HUH?
JUST LEAVE ME HANGING?
HEY, VINCE?
VINCE?
ARE YOU IN THERE?
IF YOU'RE IN THERE, HEY, MAN, I NEED TO TALK TO YOU, FOR JUST A SECOND.
CHRIST, MARTY!
I GOT COMPANY.
DIDN'T YOU GET MY TEXT?
MIMI'S GONE!
SHE'S GONE.
FUCKING GONE.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, GONE?
GONE WHERE?
SHE LEFT ME.
SHE FOUND OUT ABOUT SAN DIEGO, THAT DUMPY CHICK.
SHE SHOWED UP AND THEN TOLD HER EVERYTHING.
FUCK!
WAIT A MINUTE!
YOU DIDN'T TELL MIMI ABOUT THE LOFT?
WHAT?
!
IT'S NOT ABOUT THE GODDAMN LOFT, VINCE.
IT'S ABOUT OF MY WIFE!
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO WITHOUT HER!
DID YOU-DID YOU CONFESS?
THEN, NEVER CONFESS, MARTY.
NEVER CONFESS.
WOULD YOU GO TO HER?
JUST-JUST TELL HER THAT I LOVE HER.
YOU KNOW, AND THAT DANA'S LYING.
SHE'LL BELIEVE YOU.
MARTY, I WILL STRAIGHTEN THIS OUT FOR YOU.
I PROMISE YOU, I WILL STRAIGHTEN THIS OUT.
OK.
HEY, COME HERE.
OK.
THANKS.
OK, SO, WHAT'S THE PLAN?
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?
WE GET HER OUT OF HERE.
WHAT?
WE CAN'T JUST MAKE A BODY DISAPPEAR.
WELL, IT'S TOO BAD.
IT'S OUR ONLY HOPE.
YOU HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH HER.
NOW SHE'S SOME...
INCONVENIENT PIECE OF EVIDENCE?
WHAT KIND OF MAN ARE YOU?
THAT'S A LAUGH, COMING FROM YOU.
AND HOW DO YOU PLAN TO GET HER OFF THE BED?
CUT OFF HER HAND?
OR DO YOU HAVE THE KEY TO THOSE CUFFS?
DO YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THOUGHT HANDCUFFS WERE MORE YOUR THING, THAN MINE, PHIL.
MEANING WHAT?
YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN!
SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
YOU JUST KEEP YOUR FUCKING MOUTH SHUT, ALRIGHT?
PLEASE!
HELP-HELP ME!
PLEASE, HELP ME!
KEEP YOUR FUCKING MOUTH SHUT.
THIS FUCKING WHORE'S TRYING TO RIP ME OFF.
PLEASE, HELP ME.
HE MADE ME...
SHUT UP, ALRIGHT?
!
HEY, TAKE IT EASY.
EASY!
ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT.
IT'S GONNA BE OK.
HE'S CRAZY!
SHIT!
OK, OK.
PHILIP, GIVE ME THE KEYS.
VINCE, SHE'S GONNA GO TO THE COPS, MAN.
THE KEYS FOR THE HANDCUFFS.
SHE'S GONNA GO TO THE COPS, MAN!
THE KEYS!
YOU WANT THE KEY?
HERE'S THE KEY.
HE MADE ME DO THINGS...
I DIDN'T WANNA DO.
SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
EASY!
WHAT, YOU WANT MORE MONEY?
THAT'S IT, RIGHT?
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE MONEY, HUH?
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE FUCKING MONEY!
HERE'S YOUR FUCKING MONEY!
IT'S RIGHT THERE!
JESUS CHRIST!
THE FUCK IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR FUCKING MIND?
SHE'S A WHORE, CHRIS.
YOU KNOW WHAT A WHORE IS?
SHUT UP!
YOU CAN'T RAPE A WHORE.
SHUT UP!
YOU CAN'T RAPE A WHORE!
YOU DON'T TREAT A WOMAN LIKE THAT!
YOU GOT IT?
NOT ANY WOMAN!
BACK THE FUCK AWAY!
HEY!
DON'T PUSH ME, ALRIGHT?
!
WHAT THE FUCK IS THE MATTER WITH YOU, MAN?
!
YOU'RE PUTTING US ALL AT RISK.
I WANT THE POLICE.
HE...
HE HIT ME.
SHUT UP.
MAKE THE COPS ARREST HIM!
HE RAPED ME!
SHUT UP!
STOP SCREAMING, OR I'M GONNA RIP YOUR GODDAMN THROAT OUT!
I'VE HAD IT WITH YOU!
YOU'RE NO BETTER THAN YOUR FATHER.
I'M WHAT?
YOU HEARD ME.
OH, RIGHT, CHRIS.
THAT'S A NICE ONE.
CHRIS HAD A BETTER DEAL WITH HIS DADDY, RIGHT?
THE GREAT GUY...
WHO WANTS TO SAVE EVERYONE.
WHERE WERE YOU...
WHEN ZOE AND I...
WERE GETTING BEAT UP?
AND MOM, IN THE NEXT ROOM, PRETENDING NOT TO HEAR.
WHERE WERE YOU?
IN YOUR COZY, COLLEGE DORM, GETTING LAID AND WASTED.
'CAUSE YOU DIDN'T GIVE A FUCK.
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
YOU DIDN'T GIVE A CRAP, ALL THOSE YEARS!
WE DIDN'T EXIST FOR YOU.
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT!
IF YOU WOULD'VE TOLD ME.
IF YOU WOULD'VE SAID SOMETHING.
THEN WHAT, YOU PHONY!
THEN, WHAT?
!
I WOULD'VE GOTTEN YOU OUT OF THERE, GODDAMN IT!
BOTH OF YOU!
LISTEN.
I'M REALLY, REALLY SORRY, BUT WE CAN'T GO TO THE COPS.
HERE'S WHAT I'M GONNA DO.
NO, LISTEN!
I'VE A FRIEND, HE'S A DOCTOR.
NO!
YES, I'M GONNA DRIVE YOU TO HIM.
HE'S GONNA TAKE CARE OF YOU, OK?
NO.
NOW, HERE, LISTEN...
TAKE IT.
I KNOW IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR WHAT HAPPENED TONIGHT, BUT...
HE'S AN ANIMAL.
HE SHOULD BE LOCKED UP.
OK.
AND WE'RE GONNA DEAL WITH HIM.
I PROMISE YOU.
COME ON.
I'M GONNA GET YOUR CLOTHES...
I'M GONNA TAKE TO YOU THE DOCTOR.
NO!
EASY, HERE WE GO.
NO!
I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU FOR THIS...
NEVER!
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?
JESUS CHRIST!
WHY-WHY DON'T I KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS?
AND WHEN DID IT HAPPEN?
A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO.
WE DECIDED TO KEEP IT TO OURSELVES, 'CAUSE THAT'S THE KIND OF FRIENDS WE ARE.
DON'T LECTURE ME, ALRIGHT?
ESPECIALLY, ABOUT FRIENDSHIP.
OH, YOU-YOU'RE RIGHT, SORRY.
I MEANT TO GIVE YOU THE COKEHEAD RAPIST LECTURE.
FUCK YOU.
WELL, LOOK, YOU COULD SEE HOW I'D THINK YOU'D BE INVOLVED IN THIS.
I NEED TO SAY SOMETHING.
SHIT!
YOU HAD THAT COMING!
RELAX.
TAKE IT EASY.
YOU SON OF A BITCH.
YOU RECORDED...
EVERYTHING THAT WENT ON HERE?
EVERY WOMAN?
NOT EVERY.
NOT ALWAYS.
JUST...
SOMETIMES.
AT LEAST I DON'T CHEAT ON MY WIFE.
NO, YOU JUST WATCH US AND BEAT OFF.
YOU SICK FUCK.
YOU'RE A SICK FUCK!
LUKE, DID YOU RECORD LAST NIGHT?
NO.
YOU DIDN'T SAY YOU WERE COMING, WHICH IS AGAINST YOUR RULES.
AND IT WASN'T THE FIRST TIME YOU BROKE YOUR OWN RULES...
BY THE WAY.
NOW YOU'RE SCARED, AREN'T YOU?
NOW, YOU KNOW I'VE DOCUMENTED PRETTY MUCH EVERYTHING YOU'VE BEEN UP TO, HERE.
NO WORRIES, VINCENT.
I'LL KEEP MY MOUTH SHUT, LIKE I ALWAYS DO.
DID YOU SEE ANYTHING THAT CAN HELP US OUT, HERE?
ANYTHING AT ALL.
IF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN HURT, AND CHEATED ON, FIND OUT THE TRUTH...
WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN, VINCENT?
WHAT'S THE MATTER?
JUST DON'T FEEL LIKE LEAVING, TOMORROW.
SERIOUS?
YOU LOVE SKIING!
YES, I LOVE TO SKI, BUT JUST NOT BY MYSELF.
ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN'T COME?
HEY, YOU KNOW I CAN'T COME.
I CAN'T JUST TAKE OFF LIKE THAT.
HEY.
I'LL CALL YOU EVERY DAY.
I LOVE YOU
I KNOW THE DRILL.
ONE HOUR, RIGHT?
WRONG!
HAVE A BLAST.
DON'T MIND ME.
WHY SHOULD TONIGHT BE ANY DIFFERENT FROM THE PAST FEW MONTHS?
LOOK, ALLISON, IF IT'S ALRIGHT WITH YOU, I'D RATHER NOT SPOIL TONIGHT.
I'M SURE IT MUST BE TEMPTING TO GRAB SOMETHING SHINY AND NEW.
BUT DO YOU EVER THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU MIGHT STAND TO LOSE, CHRIS?
YOU COULD RUIN MORE THAN JUST THIS EVENING.
TELL ME, ARE YOU STILL HAPPY, ALLISON?
OH, NO!
'CAUSE IT'S FOR CHARITY, MY MOTHER-IN-LAW IS ABOUT TO JOIN THE PARTY, FOR A LITTLE WHILE.
HEARING ANYTHING ABOUT THE WATERFRONT PROJECT?
NO, HE'S GONNA CALL ONCE HE GETS HIS PERMITS.
WELL, AS FAR AS I KNOW, EVERYTHING'S APPROVED.
REALLY?
YEAH.
GOOD EVENING, GENTLEMEN.
LADIES, YOU LOOK ABSOLUTELY RAVISHING, TONIGHT.
THANK YOU!
THIS IS VINCENT STEVENS.
HE'S THE ARCHITECT WHO
DESIGNED THE NEW LOFT BUILDING, NEAR THE SPORTS ARENA.
OH, WONDERFUL!
I LOVE THAT BUILDING.
WHY, THANK YOU, MRS. KOTKIN.
I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.
AS I WAS SAYING, TO YOUR HUSBAND, IN, UH, SAN DIEGO...
GENTLEMEN, IN OUR BUSINESS, CAN'T AFFORD TO BE...
EXPOSED TO THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF BAD DESIGN.
SPEAKING OF, UH...
SAN DIEGO...
HOW'S THAT WATERFRONT PROJECT COMING ALONG?
OH, YES, UH...
WE'RE STILL WORKING IT ON.
WE'VE APPLIED FOR ALL OUR PERMITS.
NOW WE'RE WAITING.
STANDING IN LINE, LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.
YOU DON'T STRIKE ME AS THE TYPE OF MAN THAT STANDS IN LINE, MR. FRY.
WHAT ABOUT YOU, MR. KOTKIN.
ARE YOU A GAMBLING MAN?
AND YOU, MR. STEVENS?
YOU LIKE TO TAKE CHANCES?
AS A MATTER OF FACT, I DO.
ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M HOLDING A HANDFUL OF HEARTS.
ANYWAY, I DON'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT.
LADIES, IF YOU'RE AS LUCKY ON THE TABLES TONIGHT, AS YOU ARE IN LOVE,
THEN I AM SURE YOU'LL HIT YOUR JACKPOTS.
GENTLEMEN, ALWAYS A PLEASURE.
BLACKJACK.
SET ASIDE ENOUGH FOR THE ALIMONY.
MIMI, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
JUST 'CAUSE I BELIEVED YOU, THAT DOESN'T MEAN I'M STUCK AT HOME.
MIMIKIN, I WANNA COME BACK.
I KNOW I SCREWED UP, ONCE.
ONCE!
I WAS DRUNK OFF OF MY ASS.
I SWEAR IT DIDN'T MEAN A DAMN THING.
SOMETHING I DON'T UNDERSTAND ABOUT MEN.
IF IT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING, WHY BOTHER?
I PROMISE I'LL CHANGE.
INTO WHAT, A FROG?
SO, IF YOU'RE NOT A PRINCE, HOW ABOUT THE ASS YOU ALREADY ARE?
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU I WANTED TO FUCK AROUND TONIGHT?
SORRY...
IT WOULD HURT LIKE HELL, WOULDN'T IT?
HEY, MAYBE I ALREADY GOT EVEN!
MAYBE WITH ONE OF YOUR PALS, HUH?
MAYBE CHRIS?
HE'S CUTE.
OR HOW ABOUT VINCENT?
THE NIGHT YOU SENT HIM OVER FOR THAT TRAGIC, HEART TO HEART.
OH, MARTY'S REALLY SO SORRY.
MIMI, YOU GOTTA TALK TO HIM.
BLACKJACK.
OH!
WELL, LOOK AT THAT, CHUBBS!
YOUR FIRST EVER WINNING STREAK.
JUST REMEMBER, DEAR HEART...
HALF OF IT IS MINE.
YOU GAVE ZOE TICKETS, TONIGHT?
PHILIP, LET GO.
I KEEP HER AWAY FROM BULLSHIT LIKE THIS, AND YOU'RE BEHIND MY BACK...
CHRIST, PHIL, SHE'S ALMOST 20 YEARS OLD.
WHAT ARE YOU, HER FATHER?
DID YOU SEE HER?
GOD, SHE LOOKS LIKE A HOOKER.
I THOUGHT YOU LIKE WHORES.
LET HER HAVE SOME FUN.
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I'M ABOUT TO HAVE SOME FUN, TOO.
I'M KINDA ON A ROLL.
YEAH?
YEAH, YEAH.
I HOPE YOU WIN BIG TIME.
YOU'LL NEED IT WITH ALL THE SHIT YOU'VE BEEN PACKING UP YOUR NOSTRILS.
OH!
SO YOU NOTICED, A TINY FRACTION OF YOUR STASH WENT MISSING?
YOU DON'T LIKE IT, FILE FOR DIVORCE.
I HAVEN'T RULED THAT OUT.
DON'T FORGET ABOUT OUR PRENUP, LOSER.
WHILE YOU'RE AT IT, GO PLAY SOME BLACKJACK.
COULD BE YOUR LAST BEST CHANCE OF PAYING THE RENT.
CAN I GET SOME DICE OVER HERE?
ANNE?
ANNE?
WE NEED TO TALK.
YEAH, ABOUT WHAT?
YOUR PAL, THE ARCHITECT.
HE'S PLAYING WITH FIRE.
I'D ACTUALLY RATHER TALK ABOUT ANNE.
I'LL PASS ALONG YOUR MESSAGE TO VINCENT, BUT I'D LIKE SOMETHING, TOO, MR. KOTKIN.
I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO STOP SEEING ANNE.
AND WHY WOULD I DO THAT?
BECAUSE I LOVE HER.
THEN WE HAVE MORE IN COMMON THAN WE THOUGHT.
I'D LIKE YOU TO STOP PAYING HER.
I WANT YOU TO LET HER GO.
THAT'S REALLY NOT UP TO ME.
FACT IS, IT'S TOTALLY HER CHOICE.
EXCEPT I NEVER PAID FOR HER.
WELL, THAT'S TRUE.
YOU NEVER PAID.
STOP IT, JOEL!
I'M GOING.
WHAT DID HE MEAN BY THAT?
'YOU NEVER PAID.' I DON'T WANNA LOVE YOU, CHRIS.
IS HE SAYING SOMEONE'S PAYING YOU TO BE WITH ME?
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN HURT ME.
ANNE.
TELL ME IT'S A LIE.
THE FIRST TIME, IT WAS PAID FOR.
EVERY OTHER TIME, THAT WAS REAL, THAT WAS ME.
BUT, WHO PAID?
I CAN'T.
EXCUSE ME.
COME ON, ZOE, LET'S GO.
I'M FINE HERE.
I'M ASKING YOU TO GO WITH ME.
COME ON.
I'M ASKING YOU TO STOP.
OK, COME ON.
DID YOU NOT HEAR THE LADY?
MIND YOUR BUSINESS!
STOP IT!
WHAT, ARE YOU DEAF OR JUST A DICK, HUH?
I DON'T KNOW, MAN.
WHAT DOES IT SAY UP HERE?
DEAF OR DICK?
HELP ME OUT, HUH?
COME ON!
EXCUSE ME!
THANK YOU.
EXCUSE ME.
YOU'RE NOT MY DAD!
SHUT UP!
ALRIGHT, SOMEBODY GET THIS GUY AN AMBULANCE.
I NEVER WANNA SEE YOU AGAIN.
NOT IN MY HOME AND NOT NEAR MY DAUGHTER.
DO YOU GOT THAT?
GET HIM THE HELL OUTTA HERE.
OK, FOLKS, LET'S GET BACK TO THE GAMING TABLE, SHALL WE?
HEY...
IT'S OK.
I'M SORRY.
HEY, IT'S OK.
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
WHAT I AM THINKING?
SHE'S MY FRIEND'S SISTER, OK?
ARE THERE MORE?
BESIDES ME, HER AND YOUR WIFE.
WHAT'S THE GRAND TOTAL?
LOOK, I CAN'T HAVE THIS CONVERSATION HERE.
BARBARA'S STANDING RIGHT OVER THERE.
DO YOU LOVE ME?
OF COURSE, I LOVE YOU.
I'M CRAZY ABOUT YOU.
SO WOULD YOU CHOOSE, ME, IF YOU COULD?
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.
COME MEET ME IN THE LOFT, TOMORROW, OK.
WE'LL TALK IT THROUGH.
YOU'RE RIGHT, IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.
BUT MAYBE I CAN MAKE IT SIMPLE.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
MAYBE I CAN HELP YOU MAKE THAT CHOICE.
SARAH.
SARAH.
SARAH!
SARAH!
I'M SORRY!
ARE YOU ALRIGHT?
DON'T DO IT, SARAH.
YOU'LL REGRET IT.
THEY FOUND OUT.
THE WIVES, THEY DID IT.
THEY SET US UP.
WHY, VINCENT?
THEY FOUND IT.
THEY FOUND OUT.
THEY FOUND OUT ABOUT THE LOFT.
WHY WOULD YOU DO IT, VINCENT?
WE'RE YOUR FRIENDS.
NO.
WHY'D YOU DO IT?
NO, IT WAS...
THE WIVES, THEY...
THEY FOUND OUT.
NO, IT'S YOUR FRIENDS.
WE FOUND OUT.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
YOU STILL DON'T GET IT.
ALRIGHT, LET'S STRIP HIM.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU ARE A TOTAL FUCKING PSYCHOPATH.
I DID WHAT YOU TOLD ME.
I DIDN'T TELL YOU TO FUCKING CUT HER OPEN!
IT WASN'T PART OF THE PLAN.
AND THE LATIN ON THE FABRIC!
THE COPS AREN'T GONNA BELIEVE THAT BULLSHIT.
YEAH, YOU SHOULD'VE DONE IT YOURSELF.
COME ON, LET'S DO THIS.
WHAT'D YOU GIVE ME?
WHAT YOU DESERVE.
YOU KILLED SARAH?
NO, WE JUST FOUND HER.
WHAT?
WE WERE HERE, THIS MORNING, VINCENT, BEFORE YOU ARRIVED.
JESUS CHRIST.
AT FIRST, I THOUGHT SHE WAS SLEEPING.
VINCENT KNOWS HER?
SHE-SHE LEFT HIM THIS.
SEE YOU IN THE NEXT LIFE.
WHY DID SHE HAVE TO DO IT HERE?
WE GOTTA CALL THE COPS.
THEY-THEY INVESTIGATE SUICIDES.
THIS IS ALL GONNA COME OUT.
GUYS, WAIT.
CAN'T WE FIND OUT, WHERE SHE LIVES, AND-AND LEAVE HER THERE?
JESUS!
PHILIP!
COME ON!
WE HAVE TO HELP OUT VINCE.
YEAH, SPEAKING OF WHICH, WHERE THE FUCK IS VINCE?
ISN'T THIS HIS PROBLEM?
AHEMMM.
VINCENT ISN'T HERE, BECAUSE, UM...
BECAUSE I DIDN'T CALL HIM.
YOU DIDN'T CALL HIM?
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL HIM?
THERE'S SOMETHING I HAVE TO SHOW YOU.
YOU'VE BEEN TAPING US?
!
YOU FUCKING PERVERT!
YOU CAN BEAT THE CRAP OUT OF ME, LATER.
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME, AND WE NEED TO WATCH THIS.
IF WE GET A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT HAPPENED UPSTAIRS...
MAYBE YOU'LL AGREE...
WE SHOULDN'T TAKE THE HIT FOR VINCENT'S FUCKUP.
YOU SEE, VINCENT...
VINCENT HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN A GOOD FRIEND.
NO...
HEY, MAYBE I ALREADY GOT EVEN...
OR MAYBE VINCENT, THE NIGHT YOU SENT HIM OVER, FOR THAT TRAGIC, HEART TO HEART.
THEY GOT HERE LATE, THE NIGHT HE WENT TO TALK TO HER.
SHE WAS DRUNK, MARTY.
HE TOOK ADVANTAGE.
WOW!
YOUR LITTLE SISTER IS SERIOUSLY HOT!
HOW LONG HAS...?
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
HOW LONG?
HE STARTED SEEING HER RIGHT AFTER YOUR WEDDING.
THEY MET HERE, ON A REGULAR BASIS.
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, HE WAS HER FIRST.
FUCK!
GORGEOUS, HUH?
THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE...
THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN HURT YOU.
HE PAID ANNE...
TO LET YOU SEDUCE HER.
PUT THE HOOK IN, SO YOU'D WANNA SHARE THE LOFT.
THE FIRST TIME, IT WAS PAID FOR.
HAVE FUN.
CHRIS, PLEASE, YOU DON'T KNOW THE HALF OF IT, ALRIGHT?
JUST GO HOME.
HE USED HER, CHRIS.
JUST LIKE HE USED EVERYONE.
EVERYONE.
I'M GONNA KILL THAT SON OF A BITCH.
VINCENT CAN'T SENSE ANYTHING IS UP, WHEN HE WALKS IN.
WE HAVE TO TRY AND REMAIN CALM.
WE'RE GONNA GET QUESTIONED BY THE COPS.
THAT'S WHY WE CAN NEVER ADMIT WE'RE SHARING THIS LOFT.
THEY'LL TRY TO TURN US AGAINST EACH OTHER.
OK.
I THINK THIS CAN WORK.
AS LONG WE FOLLOW THE PLAN.
CHRIS?
OK.
I'M IN.
BUT, ONLY IF WE KNOW FOR SURE, THAT VINCENT WAS HERE LAST NIGHT.
I WANNA HEAR HIM SAY IT.
AND IF HE DOES, I'LL GO THROUGH WITH IT.
I'LL GIVE A SIGNAL, UH...
BREAK SOMETHING, A GLASS...
BUT NOTHING HAPPENS, UNTIL WE KNOW FOR SURE.
UNDERSTOOD?
WE'VE GOT JUST UNDER TWO HOURS TO SET EVERYTHING UP AND ESTABLISH ALIBIS.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.
YOU GUYS GET OUTTA HERE.
MAKE SURE PEOPLE SEE YOU.
YOU HAVE THE SUICIDE NOTE, RIGHT?
I'VE GOT IT.
YOU KNEW WHAT THAT PRICK WAS UP TO.
AND YOU NEVER SAID ANYTHING.
YOU'RE JUST AS SICK AS VINCENT.
THEY MET HERE ON A REGULAR BASIS.
VINCENT HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN A GOOD FRIEND.
HE STARTED SEEING HER RIGHT AFTER YOUR WEDDING.
IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN, HE WAS HER FIRST.
YOU ARE A TOTAL FUCKING PSYCHOPATH.
I DID WHAT YOU TOLD ME.
I DIDN'T TELL YOU TO FUCKING CUT HER OPEN.
IT WASN'T PART OF THE PLAN.
AND THE LATIN ON THE FABRIC!
THE COPS AREN'T GONNA BELIEVE THAT BULLSHIT!
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?
YOU'RE FRAMING ME!
SWALLOW IT.
SWALLOW.
MY OWN FRIENDS.
MY OWN FRIENDS!
AM I GONNA DIE?
NO, VINCENT, YOU'RE NOT GONNA DIE.
SARAH LURED YOU HERE AND DRUGGED YOU.
THEN SHE KILLED HERSELF, WITH YOU BY HER SIDE.
FATE WILL UNITE US.
BUT YOU'RE GONNA SURVIVE.
'CAUSE WE'RE FRIENDS, AREN'T WE?
SO, YOU SEE?
IT WAS A SETUP.
SARAH AND I WERE SET UP.
THE WHOLE THING WAS STAGED.
STILL SOUNDS A LITTLE UNBELIEVABLE, DON'T YOU THINK?
UNBELIEVABLE, BUT IT'S THE TRUTH.
YEAH.
MY LINE OF WORK, YOU GOTTA PROVE THE TRUTH, AND YOU PROVE IT WITH FACTS AND FINDINGS.
FACT IS, WE ONLY FOUND YOUR PRINTS AND THOSE OF SARAH DEAKINS.
YEAH, BECAUSE THEY WIPED THE PLACE CLEAN.
AND WE HAVE THE DVDS OF ALL YOUR SEXUAL EXPLOITS, WITH YOUR PRINTS ALL OVER THEM.
LUKE MADE THOSE DVD'S!
I NEITHER EVEN SAW 'EM, LET ALONE, TOUCHED 'EM.
YEAH, BUT WE'VE GOT NO DVDS OF YOUR FRIENDS.
NO DVDS OF MARTY'S WIFE.
NO DVDS OF PHILIP'S SISTER.
NO DVDS OF CHRIS' GIRLFRIEND, ALRIGHT?
FACTS AND FINDINGS, MR. STEVENS.
AND WE GOT NO EVIDENCE THAT YOU WERE BEING SET UP.
ALRIGHT.
IS THERE ANYTHING WE'VE FORGOTTEN?
YEAH, TO FOLLOW THE FUCKING PLAN.
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST HANDCUFF HER?
SHE WAS ALREADY DEAD.
STILL NO REASON TO MUTILATE HER.
SHE KILLED HERSELF.
I JUST MADE IT MORE DRAMATIC.
YEAH, WELL, YOU BETTER HOPE YOUR DRAMATICS DON'T PUT US IN JAIL.
LOOK, JUST-JUST LEAN ON 'EM A LITTLE BIT.
MARTY WILL BREAK, MAYBE LUKE, TOO.
LOOK, DON'T TELL ME HOW TO DO MY WORK, ALRIGHT?
WE QUESTIONED THEM ALL.
I GOT NO REASON TO BELIEVE THEY'VE BEEN LYING.
PLUS, ALL YOUR FRIENDS HAVE ALIBIS.
ALIBIS?
NOT FOR THIS MORNING, THEY DON'T.
WE GOT LUKE SEACORD AND CHRIS VANOWEN, TOGETHER, AT BREAKFAST.
WE GOT MARTY LANDRY, AT HIS OFFICE, ALRIGHT?
AT HIS OFFICE?
LOOK...
FOR AT LEAST AN HOUR, THIS MORNING, WE WERE ALL IN THE LOFT.
SO WAS PHIL.
WHAT ABOUT PHIL?
ACTUALLY, HE'S DOWNSTAIRS, RIGHT NOW, WITH HIS FATHER-IN-LAW.
FRY?
WHAT THE FUCK'S FRY DOING HERE?
HE JUST GAVE A STATEMENT.
SAYING THAT HE WAS WITH HIS SON-IN-LAW, ALL DAY.
THAT IS BULLSHIT!
THAT IS A FALSE STATEMENT!
AND WHY WOULD HE LIE?
HIRAM FRY BRINGS A LOT OF CREDIBILITY.
CREDIBILI...
I SAW FRY, IN SAN DIEGO, WITH SOME...
BIMBO, OK?
PHIL KNEW THAT.
HE KNEW I PRESSURED FRY INTO GIVING ME A WATERFRONT CONTRACT.
SO YOU TRIED TO BLACKMAIL HIRAM FRY?
VINCENT STEVENS, ENOUGH OF THIS CRAP.
WE GOT YOUR PRINTS ALL OVER THE DVDS, WE GOT 'EM ALL OVER THE KNIFE.
WE GOT YOU CHAINED, NEXT TO THE DEAD GIRL, ON THE BED, ALRIGHT?
CALL YOUR LAWYER.
MAKE A CONFESSION AND SAVE YOUR ASS.
YOU'RE FREE TO GO.
I WANNA THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION.
YOU UNDERSTAND, WE HAD TO CHECK OUT YOUR FRIEND'S STORY.
OF COURSE, THAT'S YOUR JOB.
THERE'S JUST...
ONE THING THAT'S BOTHERING ME.
WHY DOES VINCENT STEVENS KEEP ACCUSING HIS BEST FRIENDS?
I-I DON'T KNOW.
IT BOTHERS ME, TOO.
COULD IT BE...
I JUST...
I JUST WONDER...
YOU THINK HE'S TRYING TO HIDE SOMETHING ELSE?
WHA-WHAT, WHAT WOULD HE HIDING?
SARAH DEAKINS' MURDER.
MURDER?
BUT...
THE DETECTIVE, IN THE INTERROGATION, CALLED IT A SUICIDE.
WELL, THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE.
BUT THE AUTOPSY
REPORT REVEALED THAT SLEEPING PILLS DIDN'T KILL HER.
AND, HER WRIST WAS CUT, BUT NOT BY SARAH.
HESITATION MARKS, THOSE...
TENTATIVE ATTEMPTS,
THE FIRST ONES, BEFORE A SUICIDE ACTUALLY SLASHES THROUGH AN ARTERY.
THE CORONER DIDN'T FIND THOSE ON HER.
BUT, VINCENT...
HE, UH...
HE WOULD NEVER...
HIS PRINTS ARE ON THE KNIFE.
WE DIDN'T FIND A SUICIDE NOTE.
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?
WE DIDN'T FIND A SUICIDE NOTE.
YOU HAVE THE SUICIDE NOTE, RIGHT?
I'VE GOT IT...
LUKE.
CHRIS!
YOU SCARED ME.
YOU SURE IT'S SMART...
MEETING HERE?
I THINK WE HAVE A PROBLEM, LUKE.
HOW SO?
WHERE IS SARAH'S SUICIDE NOTE?
YOU PUT IT IN YOUR POCKET.
YEAH, COULDA SWORN, I DID.
BUT IT'S NOT THERE ANY MORE.
SO, WHEN DID YOU STEAL IT FROM MY COAT?
WHEN THE DOORBELL RANG THIS MORNING?
SURPRISE VISIT, FROM THE REALTOR?
CHRIS, IT'S, UH...
IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT YOU LOST SARAH'S SUICIDE NOTE, BUT...
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT.
I CALLED THE AGENCY TO ASK WHO PUT OUR LOFT UP FOR SALE.
ALL THEY COULD GIVE ME WAS A NUMBER.
I DID CALL THEM.
I WANTED TO...
I THOUGHT, MAYBE THAT...
IT'S OVER, CHRIS.
WE PULLED IT OFF.
WE'VE GOT NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT, NOW.
BUT, WHY'D THAT NOTE DISAPPEAR?
THE ONLY REAL PROOF OF HER SUICIDE?
HELLO?
SAYS SHE'S GOT AN APPOINTMENT WITH SOMEONE NAMED SARAH DEAKINS?
WHO'S SARAH DEAKINS?
IS IT BECAUSE MAYBE SHE DIDN'T WRITE IT?
MAYBE IT'S YOUR HANDWRITING?
VINCENT FUCKED US ALL.
YOU SAW.
YEAH, I SAW.
ALL THE DVDS THAT MADE EVERYBODY CRAZY.
WENT RIGHT ALONG WITH YOUR GRAND PLAN, DIDN'T IT?
BUT WHY, LUKE?
WHAT DID YOU DO TO THAT GIRL?
DID SHE GET IN YOUR WAY?
BETWEEN YOU AND VINCENT?
ACTUALLY, IT WAS VINCENT...
STANDING BETWEEN US.
IS THERE SOMEONE ELSE?
MUCH...
SARAH!
WAIT.
FORGET VINCENT.
HE'S BETTER AT GAMES THAN YOU.
ALWAYS WAS, ALWAYS WILL BE.
HE'S HURTING YOU.
USING YOU.
WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS?
I'M TELLING YOU BECAUSE...
BECAUSE I'D NEVER HURT YOU.
JUST GIVE ME THE CHANCE...
TO SHOW I'D NEVER HURT YOU.
THAT'S RIGHT.
YOU'D NEVER HURT ME.
BECAUSE I FEEL NOTHING FOR YOU, LUKE.
I'M SORRY.
MAYBE IN ANOTHER LIFE.
YOU WERE HERE LAST NIGHT?
BARBARA WAS OFF SKIING.
SO I FIGURED I'D FIND VINCENT HERE...
WITH SARAH.
I'M SORRY.
I WAITED 'TIL HE LEFT.
SHE SAID I WAS RIGHT ABOUT VINCENT.
CONSOLING...
I'VE GOTTEN SO GOOD AT IT.
I GAVE HER AN INSULIN OD.
IT'S QUICK, PAINLESS.
LEAVES NO TRACE.
JESUS, LUKE.
I DID IT OUT OF LOVE...
I SWEAR.
AND VINCENT TAKING THE FALL FOR THIS.
IT'S OK WITH YOU?
VINCENT USED EVERYONE AND ANYONE!
IT'S ABOUT TIME WE TURNED THE TABLES!
WELL, HE'S BEING CHARGED WITH MURDER.
YEAH.
SARAH WASN'T DEAD, WHEN YOU LEFT HER WITH PHILIP.
NO...
NO, YOU'RE LYING.
NO.
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.
WHAT PHILIP DID TO HER...
WAS SICK.
YOU'RE SICK, LUKE.
BUT...
IF I'M HEARING YOU RIGHT...
IT WAS YOUR BROTHER...
WHO KILLED SARAH.
OK, CHRIS.
GO HOME.
I'LL CLEAN UP.
LIKE ALWAYS.
NO.
NO MORE CLEANING UP, LUKE.
STEP OUTSIDE.
LUKE.
NOW.
JESUS!
LET ME HELP YOU, LUKE, PLEASE!
YOU GONNA KILL ME, TOO?
IT'S YOUR OWN FAULT.
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO, JUMP?
YES, IF YOU DON'T MIND!
LUKE!
YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THIS.
JESUS CHRIST, LUKE.
WILL YOU STOP IT?
I DON'T WANNA HURT YOU, CHRIS.
I REALLY DON'T.
SO JUST DO IT.
NEVER!
I CALLED THE COPS, BEFORE I CAME.
I TOLD THEM EVERYTHING.
BULLSHIT!
I KNOW YOU HAVEN'T.
I THOUGHT I KNEW YOU.
WHAT ABOUT THE NOTE, HUH?
YOU WANT THIS TO GO DOWN WITH ME, TOO?
GIVE ME THAT NOTE, CHRIS.
GIVE IT TO ME!
IT'S OVER, LUKE.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT IS OVER.
TELL ALLIE AND THE KIDS...
I'M SORRY.
WOULD YOU DO THAT FOR ME, CHRIS?
NO, COME ON, CHRIS.
BE A FRIEND.
LUKE!
LUKE!
LUKE!
LUKE!
LUKE!
THEY'RE MARRIED.
HONEY, NO.
THEY'RE HAVING AN AFFAIR.
BECAUSE SHE'S LAUGHING AT HIS JOKES?
NO, I'M TELLING YOU THEY'RE HAVING AN AFFAIR.
WELL, SINCE WHEN ARE YOU THE BIG EXPERT ON AFFAIRS?
REALLY?
THANKS FOR TAKING ME BACK, MEEMS.
WELL, WHAT WAS MY ALTERNATIVE?
TO LEAVE YOU WAILING AT
THE FRONT DOOR, WITH SNOT POURING OUT OF YOUR NOSE?
SORRY, DIDN'T MEAN TO SCARE YOU OFF.
I HAVE THE KIDS EARLY TOMORROW, SO I GOTTA GO.
ARE YOU GONNA LEAVE ME HERE, ALONE?
WITH MY WIFE?
YES.
COME ON,
WE CAN AT LEAST HAVE ONE MORE DRINK.
THERE'LL BE PLENTY MORE DRINKS.
GOODNIGHT, MEEMS.
GOOD NIGHT, CHRIS.
CHRIS!
ANNE?
HI.
HI.
YOU LOOK GOOD.
THANK YOU, YOU, TOO.
LISTEN, I STILL HAVE THE KEY.
DO YOU WANT IT BACK?
IT WON'T WORK ANYMORE.
VINCENT'S LIVING THERE ALONE, NOW.
IT'S THE ONLY THING HIS WIFE LET HIM KEEP.
AND, UH...
AND PHILIP?
HE'S AWAITING TRIAL.
WE'LL SEE.
AND YOU?
YOU DOING OK?
YEAH.
MOST OF THE TIME.
AND THE REST OF THE TIME?
I HEARD YOU DITCHED THE CITY COUNCILMAN?
THAT'S NOT ALL I'VE GIVEN UP.
UH, DO YOU WANNA GRAB A CUP OF COFFEE, OR...?
THE END
SUBTITLES BY KOUSHIK DAS
SUBTITLES BY KOUSHIK DAS
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.
BUT YOU HAVE
DON'T YOU THINK?
OK?
THE WHOLE THING WAS STAGED.
SO YOU WERE AFRAID?
THAT'S YOUR CLAIM.
YOU WERE THE VICTIM?
NOT...
NOT LIKE...
NOT LIKE WHO?
NOT LIKE HER?
JUST TALK TO THE OTHERS GUYS.
HAVE YOU TALKED TO THE OTHERS THERE?
WE'RE DOING OUR JOBS.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND CONFESS?
SAVE SOME LEGAL FEES.
COME ON.
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE US THROUGH THE EVENTS OF THIS MORNING?
MR. STEVENS.
MR. STEVENS?
I WAS AT HOME.
ALONE.
MY WIFE'S TAKING THE KIDS SKIING.
AS WE SPEAK.
OF HER OWN.
THE PHONE WOKE YOU AROUND WHAT TIME THIS MORNING?
9-9:30.
IT-IT WAS LUKE IN A PANIC.
HE SAID I HAD TO COME.
WHERE WERE YOU SUPPOSED TO GO?
TO THE LOFT.
HE TOLD ME TO COME TO THE LOFT.
DID HE SAY WHY HE WAS PANICKING?
DID YOU KNOW WHY HE WAS PANICKING?
NOT YET.
LUKE.
LUKE?
MY GOD!
FUCK!
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?
I DON'T KNOW.
YOU JUST...
WERE YOU...
IN SHE WAS...
LYING THERE...
FUCK!
HAVE YOU CALLED THE OTHERS?
CHRIS AND MARTY ARE ON THEIR WAY.
UH...
WE NEED EVERYBODY HERE.
DO YOU KNOW WHO SHE IS?
OF-OF COURSE NOT.
A DOOR?
WINDOWS ARE SEALED AND THE DOOR WAS LOCKED.
THE ALARM WAS TURNED OFF.
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
THE DOOR WAS LOCKED AND THE ALARM WAS TURNED OFF.
BUT THAT'D MEAN THAT...
THAT SOMEONE GOT IN...
WITH ONE OF OUR KEYS.
MR. SEACORD?
NO.
DOWN BY THE SPORTS ARENA?
VINCENT STEVENS.
VINCENT RUNS A VERY LARGE FIRM.
HE'S DONE A LOT OF BUILDINGS.
MR. SEACORD.
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN THERE?
NO.
YOU AND FOUR FRIENDS ARE SHARING THIS LOFT
WITHOUT YOUR WIVES' KNOWLEDGE.
THAT IS RIDICULOUS.
DON'T THE FIVE OF YOU BRING WOMEN UP THERE?
CATCH OF THE DAY? THE MRS. MIGHT FIND.
THAT IS PREPOSTEROUS.
BUT ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS ALREADY MADE A FULL CONFESSION.
YOU WANNA KNOW WHO?
LISTEN...
I...
YES.
MR. SEACORD?
I WALKED INTO A DOOR.
OR WERE YOU IN A FIGHT?
I SAID I WALKED INTO A DOOR.
WHERE WERE YOU THIS MORNING?
HAVING BREAKFAST.
THERE'D BE A LOT OF PEOPLE AT THE RESTAURANT TO VERIFY THAT.
THE PSYCHIATRIST?
THAT'S RIGHT.
ONE OF YOUR LOFT BUDDIES?
UH...
EITHER.
CHRIS.
SHIT!
PHILIP.
PHILIP?
YOU THINK YOUR BROTHER HAS SOMETHING TO DO THIS?
NO.
WE GOTTA CALL THE COPS.
IF WE CALL THE COPS?
THINK ABOUT OUR WIVES.
VINCENT.
WHY DO WE THINK PHILLIP IS INVOLVED?
I KNOW.
THEN MAYBE WE CAN...
WE GONNA DUMP THE BODY SOMEWHERE?
BUT I'M NOT TAKING THE FALL FOR THIS.
MARTY...
SON OF A BITCH!
HAVE YOU SEEN PHIL?
DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS?
WAS HE HERE LAST NIGHT?
THIS CAN'T BE REAL.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I WANNA SEE HER.
PUT HER BACK.
GODDAMMIT.
WHO IS SHE?
I DON'T KNOW.

WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT WHAT HAPPENED HERE AND WE'LL FIGURE A WAY OUT.

I LIKE IT.
YOU MADE IT.
HI.
HI.
HI!
HOW-HOW ARE YOU?

I THINK VINCENT'S LITTLE CONDOS ARE A LITTLE OUT OF OUR LEAGUE.
YOU AND YOUR PUNY PSYCHIATRIST SALARY.
ALRIGHT?
MAN.
HON.

SO HOT!
IT'S LIKE THEY'RE IN VIOLATION OF THE FUCKING FIRE CODE.
CALM DOWN.

CHUBBS?
HAVIN' TOO MUCH FUN?
LUKE.
YOU MAY BE HERE ALL BY YOURSELF.
DON'T RAISE MY HOPES ONLY TO DASH THEM.
SHE'S JUST FEELING DIZZY.
DUCKED OUT TO CHECK HER BLOOD SUGAR.
ALLIE.
YOU FEEL OK?
BUT...
SWEETIE.
SWEETIE?
AFTER SHE JUST CHECKED HER BLOOD SUGAR.
THAT'S FUNNY.
THAT'S REALLY GOOD.

CYNICAL?
IT'S JUST A KEY TO A ROOM.
YOU'RE NOT LIKE THAT.
OR LATER?
COME ON.
ATTABOY!

I TOLD YOU.
I FALL FOR THE WRONG MEN.
CAN YOU KEEP A SECRET?
IN HIS POCKET.
IT'S A TURN-ON FOR HIM.
SO NAKED...
ONLY HE KNOWS.
WHY DO YOU LET HIM USE YOU LIKE THAT?
WHO SAYS HE'S USING ME?
MAYBE...
IT TURNS ME ON.
EVEN MORE...
I HOPE YOU DON'T CATCH COLD.
CHRIS.
MAYBE I-I WAS TESTING YOU.
I DON'T NEED TO BE TESTED.
DO YOU WANT...
MAYBE GET A CUP OF COFFEE...
SOMEPLACE QUIET...

IT'S EXTREMELY FUCKING IMPORTANT.
SOMEONE GOT IN USING A KEY AND YOURS IS MISSING.
IS THAT RIGHT VINCENT?
THEN HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT THE ALARM WAS SHUT OFF?
'CAUSE IT DEFINITELY HAD TO BE ONE OF US FIVE.
UNLESS...
UNLESS WHAT?
UNLESS SHE LET HIM IN.
VINCENT? WHO'S HIDING SOMETHING?
POLYAMORY.
IT'S A...
SOME SORT OF BELIEF SYSTEM ABOUT BEING ROMANTICALLY
AT THE SAME TIME.
HUH.
AND YOUR BOSS GET AWAY WITH THAT?
SO WHY SHOULD HE HAVE TO CHOOSE?
HUH.
AND HIS WIFE IS AMAZINGLY COOL WITH IT.
REALLY?
IS SHE SPECIAL NEEDS?
MAYBE OXYGEN DEPRIVED?
WHAT?
EXPLAIN.
I'D LIKE TO KNOW.
BARBARA.
WHAT'S IT CALLED AGAIN?
POLYANNEMARIE?
CHUBBS.
YOU CAN BARELY HANDLE ONE WOMAN.
WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH TWO?
HMMM.
MARRY ONE.
I WOULD MAKE UP SOMETHING.
SOME SORT OF GAME THAT INVOLVES TWO LADIES AND ONE GUY.
OR SOMETHING.
COULD YOU AT LEAST FAKE SOME ENTHUSIASM?
I'M COOKING.
COULD YOU AT LEAST TRY AND MAKE IT HOME IN TIME?
OK?
WILL YOU JUST JOIN US?
I JUST HOPE THE PUDGY CLOWN DOESN'T PUKE ON THE RUG.
HE'S BEEN CHUGGING VODKA LIKE IT'S EVIAN.
DOESN'T HIS WIFE SEE THAT?
SHE WAS JUST COOL WITH IT LONG ENOUGH TO CATCH HIM IN THE ACT.
SHE HIRED A DETECTIVE.
THE WORKS.
MY POOR BOSS WENT FROM POLYAMORY TO ALIMONY.
WHAT-WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?
UH...
HE AND HIS CONCUBINE ARE NOW CRAMPED IN A TINY ONE BEDROOM CONDO...
WITH A BRAND NEW PAIR OF FAKE BREASTS.
HOW CAN MEN STAND FAKE BREASTS?
FAKE TITS THAT?

AND THEN YOU GO WITH HER AND STIR...
HONEY....

I MEAN HE DIDN'T COMPARTMENTALIZE.
DO YOU GUYS AGREE?
MARTY.
HOW WOULD YOU COMPARTMENTALIZE?
HOW?
I WOULDN'T HAVE A PLACE THAT YOU COULD GET CAUGHT.
BOY.
AM I RIGHT?
YOU'VE-YOU'VE LOST US ALL.
VINNY BOY. OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
YOU ALRIGHT?
YEAH?
THERE WE GO.
WOULD YOU GIVE ME A HAND?

NO PROBLEM.
I GUESS.
IT GETS ALL UP IN YOUR NOSE AND SHIT.
IT'S A LITTLE SPICY.
YEAH.
I'M OUTTA HERE.
BOY.
I NEED TO PICK UP SOME MORE INSULIN.
LUKE...
IS THERE SOMETHING YOU WANNA TELL ME?
ARE YOU KEEPING SECRETS?
WHAT KIND OF SECRETS?
IS THERE SOMEONE ELSE?
BUT THE ANSWER IS NO.
LUKE.
I'M ASKING IF THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE.
AND...
I KNOW I'M NOT AS GLAMOROUS AS SOME.
BUT I'LL ALWAYS BE THERE FOR YOU...
AND THE CHILDREN.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO WITHOUT YOU.
I WANT YOU TO KNOW...
THERE'S A LOT I COULD PUT UP WITH...
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I NEED TO GET HER OUT OF HERE.
HOW?
SHE IS SHACKLED TO THE BED!
CAN'T YOU GUYS SEE WHAT'S GOING ON?
SOMEONE IS TRYING TO FRAME US.
WHO?
WHO WANTS TO FRAME US?
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT THINK ABOUT IT.
THE BODY'S CUFFED TO THE BED.
IT'S POSSIBLE TO MOVE.
THE COPS COULD BE HERE ANY SECOND.
BUT NONE OF US KNOW WHO THIS GIRL IS.
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW SHE GOT IN HERE.
WHO ELSE KNEW ABOUT THE ARRANGEMENT?
WHO ELSE KNOWS ABOUT OUR ARRANGEMENT?
DID ANYONE BLAB?
TELL ONE OF THE GIRLS THAT HAVE BEEN UP HERE?
MARTY?
WHAT?
WHY ME?
VINCENT.
WHILE SOMEONE WAS WATCHING?
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
I JUST TOLD YOU.
VINCENT?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING WITH THIS?
SOMEONE IS TRYING TO SET US UP.
LIKE WHO?
BETRAYED HUSBAND.
SOMEONE WITH A MOTIVE.
IS ONE OF YOU GUYS IN SOME KIND OF TROUBLE?
I THINK I MAY BE FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOU.
I MEAN IT.
CHRIS?
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN FEEL IT?
I'VE NEVER CHEATED ON MY WIFE BEFORE...
AND I DON'T FALL IN LOVE EASILY.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO LOVE ME.
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ME.
BUT...
THEY'RE JUST MOMENTS.
PLEASE.
NOT JUST FOR THIS.
NO.
STOP IT.
I...
I DON'T WANT YOU TO LOVE ME.
I DON'T WANNA KEEP SNEAKING AROUND.
YOU'RE NOT.
I AM.
ANNE!
I'M GONNA LEAVE HER.
STOP IT.
WHY YOU DOING THIS?
THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE...
THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN HURT YOU.
ANNE.
STOP.
STOP WHAT?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
WOULD YOU...
OK?
THAT'S THE END OF IT.
NO.

I'M A PROSTITUTE.
I FUCK MEN FOR MONEY.
DO YOU GET IT NOW?
I WON'T BILL YOU FOR THE PAST
WOULD YOU...
CHRIS...
WOULD YOU WAIT A MINUTE?
ALRIGHT?
JUST GO HOME.
GO HOME TO YOUR WIFE AND YOUR KIDS.
MR. LANDRY?
I-I DOUBT THAT.
UM....
RIGHT?
MARTY?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.
WHY DOES YOUR WIFE WANT A DIVORCE?
DIVORCE IS NOT THE RIGHT...
WHAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH...
A SEPARATION.
IT'S A TRIAL SEPARATION.
WHY?
WASN'T TOO HAPPY ABOUT.
YOU FUCKED AROUND ON HER?
IF YOU WANNA BE TECHNICAL.
HOW'D SHE FIND OUT?
THE WOMAN WITH WHOM I...
FUCKED AROUND?
AND SHE SHOWED UP ON OUR FRONT PORCH.
STARTED SAYING THINGS.
BECAUSE I LOVE HER VERY MUCH.
TO THE LOFT?
WHAT?
NO.
THIS HAPPENED IN SAN DIEGO.
RIGHT?
IN SAN DIEGO?
YEAH.
WHY YOU WERE THERE?
IT'S...
A COUPLE NIGHTS IN A FANCY HOTEL AND CHANCE TO GET AWAY FOR A COUPLE DAYS.

THOSE GIRLS ARE DROOLING ALL OVER YOU.
TOO.
I DON'T TAKE A RAINCHECK ON THAT.
WHAT?
ARE YOU FUCKING CRAZY?
WHY WOULDN'T YOU INVITE THEM OVER?
IN A BARREL.
DOES BARBARA KNOW ABOUT THESE DEEP SEA EXPEDITIONS OF YOURS?
SEACORD?
YOU'VE GOT A KEY TO THE LOFT.

TAKE IT ALL OFF.
NOT BAD.
LUKE?
ARE YOU GONNA JOIN US?
RIGHT HERE.
AND...
MAYBE HE WON'T DARE.
OR MAYBE VINCENT'S NOT INTERESTED.
MAYBE VINCENT'D RATHER DO LAPS. GLANCES THAT EACH LASTED A SECOND TOO LONG.
HUH?
I DO.
AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE.
I'M BETTER AT IT THAN YOU.
CAN YOU FEEL ME?
MOST DEFINITELY.
MARTY?
DUDE!
KINDA BUSY HERE!
DON'T STOP!
GO!
GO!
SHIT!
IS WHAT IT IS.
YOU'RE RUNNING AWAY FROM YOUR FEELINGS.
I WANT TO SAY GOODBYE.
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT IT'S LIKE TO REALLY LOVE SOMEONE?
I'M SORRY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
THROW IT AWAY.
IT'S EMPTY.
YOU WERE HERE YESTERDAY...
WEREN'T YOU?
GUYS...
WE GOTTA GO TO THE COPS.
WE'RE NOT GETTING ANYWHERE WITH THIS.
I THINK VINCENT HAS SOMETHING TO TELL YOU.
LET'S HEAR IT.
HELLO?
WHO IS IT?
WHO IS IT?
WHO WANTS TO COME UP.
SOMEBODY'S LISTED THE LOFT FOR SALE?
JESUS FUCKING...
LISTED THE LOFT?
SHE SAYS SHE HAS AN APPOINTMENT WITH A DEAKINS?
SARAH DEAKINS?
WHO-WHO'S SARAH DEAKINS?
WAIT...
WHO THE HELL IS TRYING TO SELL OUR LOFT?
MARTY.
WHAT?
AND SO DOES LUKE.
SARAH DEAKINS IS LYING ON THE BED.
I HAVE NEVER SEEN A SARAH DEAKINS.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
YOU KNOW HER.
WHY DO YOU KEEP SAYING THAT?
REMEMBER?
DANA'S FRIEND.
THE LAST NIGHT I-I WAS WASTED OUT OF MY MIND.
THE WHOLE NIGHT'S A BLUR.
JESUS!
DON'T YOU?
THAT'S SARAH?
RIGHT?
I-I REMEMBER SARAH.
BUT HOW-HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT'S SARAH?
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?
I DID NOT.
I THINK THERE'S BEEN A MISTAKE.
WE DON'T KNOW ANYONE NAMED SARAH DEAKINS.
COME ON.
WHO IS IT?
DO WE KNOW HER?
I DON'T KNOW.
FUCK!
VINCE?
OR IS THERE MORE?
THING...
WITH HER.
I BROUGHT HER UP HERE A COUPLE OF TIMES.
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.
WILL YOU JUST FUCKING TELL ME?
WERE YOU HERE WITH HER LAST NIGHT?
WERE YOU THE ONE WHO LET HER IN?
I BROKE UP WITH HER LAST NIGHT.
WHEN I LEFT.
IT STILL DOESN'T EXPLAIN WHY SOMEONE LISTED THE LOFT!
OR JUST BROWSING?
AT LEAST HAVE THE DECENCY...
HOW CAN I DUMP YOU?
THERE'S NOTHING BETWEEN US.
THAT'S WHAT IT MEANT TO YOU?
NOTHING.
ALREADY?
WHO I AM?
WHAT I DO?
I HAVEN'T.
IT DOESN'T CHANGE HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU.
HOW MANY WOMEN HAVE YOU TAKEN TO THAT THAT FUCK PAD YOU SHARE WITH YOUR FOUR LITTLE BUDDIES?
WHAT?
CHRIS...
SAVE IT FOR SOME GIRL WHO'LL ACTUALLY BUY YOUR BULLSHIT.
WAIT.
YOU KNOW I'M NOT LIKE THAT.
HERE.
I ONLY NEED THIS IF I'M WITH YOU.
SO YOU KEEP IT.
YOU LET ME KNOW.
CHRIS?
OH!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
SHOPPING FOR ALLISON?
I WAS JUST...
HERE WITH A COLLEAGUE.
WITH YOUR PALS?
I'M NOT SHARING A LOFT WITH ANY PALS.
WHEN THE BUILDING FIRST OPENED.
YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHERE THE BUILDING WAS.
I NEVER TOOK ANYONE UP THERE.
I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT YOU MEANT.
DID YOU KNOW THE GIRL?
IN SAN DIEGO.
ARE YOU AWARE THAT MR. STEVENS BEGAN A RELATIONSHIP WITH HER IN SAN DIEGO?
FRANKLY.
YOU DIDN'T KNOW.
ISN'T VINCENT STEVENS YOUR BEST FRIEND?
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE.
YOU'RE TRYING TO TURN US AGAINST EACH OTHER.
BUT GUESS WHAT?
I'M NOT ABOUT TO START TRASHING MY FRIEND.
THAT YOU WERE JEALOUS OF YOU BEST FRIEND?
HE'S NAILING ALL THESE BEAUTIFUL WOMEN...
I AM A MARRIED MAN.
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN NAILING WOMEN.
I'M NOT JEALOUS OF VINCENT.
JEALOUS OF THE WOMEN.
WHERE DO YOU GET OFF...
WITH AN INUENDO LIKE THAT?
MR. SEACORD?
AND HE HAS BEEN FOR YEARS.
MR. SEACORD.
YOU AND THE REST OF YOUR GANG.
ASSHOLE.
YOU LYING PIECE OF SHIT!
RIGHT?
PUT THE KNIFE DOWN.
PHILIP!
PUT THE KNIFE...
PUT THE KNIFE DOWN.
BACK OFF.
THE LOFT IS LISTED IN HER NAME.
THAT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE.
YOU MEAN!
JESUS!
GET A FUCKING GRIP!
FUCK!
WE CANNOT KEEP DOING THIS.
MARTY?
HUH?
JUST LEAVE ME HANGING?
VINCE?
VINCE?
ARE YOU IN THERE?
FOR JUST A SECOND.
MARTY!
I GOT COMPANY.
DIDN'T YOU GET MY TEXT?
MIMI'S GONE!
GONE?
GONE WHERE?
THAT DUMPY CHICK.
SHE SHOWED UP AND THEN TOLD HER EVERYTHING.
FUCK!
WAIT A MINUTE!
YOU DIDN'T TELL MIMI ABOUT THE LOFT?
VINCE.
IT'S ABOUT OF MY WIFE!
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO WITHOUT HER!
MARTY.
NEVER CONFESS.
WOULD YOU GO TO HER?
JUST-JUST TELL HER THAT I LOVE HER.
AND THAT DANA'S LYING.
SHE'LL BELIEVE YOU.
I WILL STRAIGHTEN THIS OUT.
COME HERE.
OK.
WHAT'S THE PLAN?
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?
WE GET HER OUT OF HERE.
IT'S TOO BAD.
IT'S OUR ONLY HOPE.
YOU HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH HER.
NOW SHE'S SOME...
INCONVENIENT PIECE OF EVIDENCE?
COMING FROM YOU.
AND HOW DO YOU PLAN TO GET HER OFF THE BED?
CUT OFF HER HAND?
OR DO YOU HAVE THE KEY TO THOSE CUFFS?
PHIL.
MEANING WHAT?
YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN!
ALRIGHT?
HELP ME!
KEEP YOUR FUCKING MOUTH SHUT.
HELP ME.
HE MADE ME...
TAKE IT EASY.
EASY!
ALRIGHT.
IT'S GONNA BE OK.
HE'S CRAZY!
GIVE ME THE KEYS.
MAN.
THE KEYS FOR THE HANDCUFFS.
MAN!
THE KEYS!
YOU WANT THE KEY?
HERE'S THE KEY.
HE MADE ME DO THINGS...
I DIDN'T WANNA DO.
SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
EASY!
RIGHT?
HUH?
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE FUCKING MONEY!
HERE'S YOUR FUCKING MONEY!
IT'S RIGHT THERE!
JESUS CHRIST!
THE FUCK IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR FUCKING MIND?
CHRIS.
YOU KNOW WHAT A WHORE IS?
SHUT UP!
YOU CAN'T RAPE A WHORE.
SHUT UP!
YOU CAN'T RAPE A WHORE!
YOU DON'T TREAT A WOMAN LIKE THAT!
YOU GOT IT?
NOT ANY WOMAN!
ALRIGHT?
!
MAN?
!
YOU'RE PUTTING US ALL AT RISK.
I WANT THE POLICE.
HE...
HE HIT ME.
SHUT UP.
MAKE THE COPS ARREST HIM!
HE RAPED ME!
SHUT UP!
OR I'M GONNA RIP YOUR GODDAMN THROAT OUT!
I'VE HAD IT WITH YOU!
YOU'RE NO BETTER THAN YOUR FATHER.
I'M WHAT?
YOU HEARD ME.
CHRIS.
THAT'S A NICE ONE.
RIGHT?
THE GREAT GUY...
WHO WANTS TO SAVE EVERYONE.
WHERE WERE YOU...
WHEN ZOE AND I...
WERE GETTING BEAT UP?
PRETENDING NOT TO HEAR.
WHERE WERE YOU?
GETTING LAID AND WASTED.
'CAUSE YOU DIDN'T GIVE A FUCK.
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
ALL THOSE YEARS!
WE DIDN'T EXIST FOR YOU.
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT!
IF YOU WOULD'VE TOLD ME.
IF YOU WOULD'VE SAID SOMETHING.
GODDAMN IT!
BOTH OF YOU!
BUT WE CAN'T GO TO THE COPS.
HE'S A DOCTOR.
I'M GONNA DRIVE YOU TO HIM.
OK?
NO.
BUT...
HE'S AN ANIMAL.
HE SHOULD BE LOCKED UP.
OK.
AND WE'RE GONNA DEAL WITH HIM.
I PROMISE YOU.
COME ON.
I'M GONNA GET YOUR CLOTHES...
I'M GONNA TAKE TO YOU THE DOCTOR.
HERE WE GO.
NO!
I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU FOR THIS...
NEVER!
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?
JESUS CHRIST!
WHY-WHY DON'T I KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS?
AND WHEN DID IT HAPPEN?
'CAUSE THAT'S THE KIND OF FRIENDS WE ARE.
ABOUT FRIENDSHIP.
SORRY.
I MEANT TO GIVE YOU THE COKEHEAD RAPIST LECTURE.
FUCK YOU.
YOU COULD SEE HOW I'D THINK YOU'D BE INVOLVED IN THIS.
I NEED TO SAY SOMETHING.
SHIT!
YOU HAD THAT COMING!
RELAX.
TAKE IT EASY.
YOU SON OF A BITCH.
YOU RECORDED...
EVERYTHING THAT WENT ON HERE?
EVERY WOMAN?
NOT EVERY.
NOT ALWAYS.
JUST...
SOMETIMES.
YOU JUST WATCH US AND BEAT OFF.
YOU SICK FUCK.
YOU'RE A SICK FUCK!
DID YOU RECORD LAST NIGHT?
WHICH IS AGAINST YOUR RULES.
AND IT WASN'T THE FIRST TIME YOU BROKE YOUR OWN RULES...
BY THE WAY.
AREN'T YOU?
HERE.
LIKE I ALWAYS DO.
HERE?
ANYTHING AT ALL.
FIND OUT THE TRUTH...
VINCENT?
TOMORROW.
BUT JUST NOT BY MYSELF.
ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN'T COME?
YOU KNOW I CAN'T COME.
I CAN'T JUST TAKE OFF LIKE THAT.
HEY.
I'LL CALL YOU EVERY DAY.
I LOVE YOU
RIGHT?
WRONG!
HAVE A BLAST.
DON'T MIND ME.
WHY SHOULD TONIGHT BE ANY DIFFERENT FROM THE PAST FEW MONTHS?
I'D RATHER NOT SPOIL TONIGHT.
I'M SURE IT MUST BE TEMPTING TO GRAB SOMETHING SHINY AND NEW.
CHRIS?
ALLISON?
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.
HE'S GONNA CALL ONCE HE GETS HIS PERMITS.
EVERYTHING'S APPROVED.
REALLY?
YEAH.
GENTLEMEN.
TONIGHT.
THANK YOU!
THIS IS VINCENT STEVENS.
HE'S THE ARCHITECT WHO
NEAR THE SPORTS ARENA.
WONDERFUL!
I LOVE THAT BUILDING.
MRS. KOTKIN.
I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.
SAN DIEGO...
CAN'T AFFORD TO BE...
EXPOSED TO THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF BAD DESIGN.
UH...
SAN DIEGO...
HOW'S THAT WATERFRONT PROJECT COMING ALONG?
UH...
WE'RE STILL WORKING IT ON.
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.
MR. FRY.
MR. KOTKIN.
ARE YOU A GAMBLING MAN?
MR. STEVENS?
YOU LIKE TO TAKE CHANCES?
I DO.
ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M HOLDING A HANDFUL OF HEARTS.
I DON'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT. ALWAYS A PLEASURE.
BLACKJACK.
SET ASIDE ENOUGH FOR THE ALIMONY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
THAT DOESN'T MEAN I'M STUCK AT HOME.
ONCE.
ONCE!
I WAS DRUNK OFF OF MY ASS.
I SWEAR IT DIDN'T MEAN A DAMN THING.
WHY BOTHER?
I PROMISE I'LL CHANGE.
HOW ABOUT THE ASS YOU ALREADY ARE?
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU I WANTED TO FUCK AROUND TONIGHT?
SORRY...
MAYBE I ALREADY GOT EVEN!
HUH?
MAYBE CHRIS?
HE'S CUTE.
HEART TO HEART.
YOU GOTTA TALK TO HIM.
BLACKJACK.
CHUBBS!
YOUR FIRST EVER WINNING STREAK.
DEAR HEART...
HALF OF IT IS MINE.
LET GO.
AND YOU'RE BEHIND MY BACK...
HER FATHER?
DID YOU SEE HER?
SHE LOOKS LIKE A HOOKER.
I THOUGHT YOU LIKE WHORES.
TOO.
I'M KINDA ON A ROLL.
YEAH.
I HOPE YOU WIN BIG TIME.
YOU'LL NEED IT WITH ALL THE SHIT YOU'VE BEEN PACKING UP YOUR NOSTRILS.
A TINY FRACTION OF YOUR STASH WENT MISSING?
FILE FOR DIVORCE.
LOSER.
GO PLAY SOME BLACKJACK.
COULD BE YOUR LAST BEST CHANCE OF PAYING THE RENT.
CAN I GET SOME DICE OVER HERE?
ANNE?
ANNE?
WE NEED TO TALK.
THE ARCHITECT.
HE'S PLAYING WITH FIRE.
I'D ACTUALLY RATHER TALK ABOUT ANNE.
MR. KOTKIN.
I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO STOP SEEING ANNE.
AND WHY WOULD I DO THAT?
BECAUSE I LOVE HER.
THEN WE HAVE MORE IN COMMON THAN WE THOUGHT.
I'D LIKE YOU TO STOP PAYING HER.
I WANT YOU TO LET HER GO.
IT'S TOTALLY HER CHOICE.
EXCEPT I NEVER PAID FOR HER.
THAT'S TRUE.
YOU NEVER PAID.
JOEL!
I'M GOING.
CHRIS.
IS HE SAYING SOMEONE'S PAYING YOU TO BE WITH ME?
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN HURT ME.
ANNE.
TELL ME IT'S A LIE.
IT WAS PAID FOR.
THAT WAS ME.
WHO PAID?
I CAN'T.
LET'S GO.
I'M FINE HERE.
I'M ASKING YOU TO GO WITH ME.
COME ON.
I'M ASKING YOU TO STOP.
COME ON.
DID YOU NOT HEAR THE LADY?
MIND YOUR BUSINESS!
STOP IT!
HUH?
MAN.
WHAT DOES IT SAY UP HERE?
DEAF OR DICK?
HUH?
COME ON!
EXCUSE ME!
THANK YOU.
EXCUSE ME.
YOU'RE NOT MY DAD!
SOMEBODY GET THIS GUY AN AMBULANCE.
I NEVER WANNA SEE YOU AGAIN.
NOT IN MY HOME AND NOT NEAR MY DAUGHTER.
DO YOU GOT THAT?
GET HIM THE HELL OUTTA HERE.
SHALL WE?
HEY...
IT'S OK.
IT'S OK.
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
WHAT I AM THINKING?
OK?
HER AND YOUR WIFE.
WHAT'S THE GRAND TOTAL?
I CAN'T HAVE THIS CONVERSATION HERE.
BARBARA'S STANDING RIGHT OVER THERE.
I LOVE YOU.
I'M CRAZY ABOUT YOU.
IF YOU COULD?
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.
OK.
WE'LL TALK IT THROUGH.
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.
BUT MAYBE I CAN MAKE IT SIMPLE.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
MAYBE I CAN HELP YOU MAKE THAT CHOICE.
SARAH.
SARAH.
SARAH!
SARAH!
I'M SORRY!
ARE YOU ALRIGHT?
SARAH.
YOU'LL REGRET IT.
THEY FOUND OUT.
THEY DID IT.
THEY SET US UP.
VINCENT?
THEY FOUND IT.
THEY FOUND OUT.
THEY FOUND OUT ABOUT THE LOFT.
VINCENT?
WE'RE YOUR FRIENDS.
NO.
WHY'D YOU DO IT?
THEY...
THEY FOUND OUT.
IT'S YOUR FRIENDS.
WE FOUND OUT.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
YOU STILL DON'T GET IT.
LET'S STRIP HIM.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU ARE A TOTAL FUCKING PSYCHOPATH.
I DID WHAT YOU TOLD ME.
I DIDN'T TELL YOU TO FUCKING CUT HER OPEN!
IT WASN'T PART OF THE PLAN.
AND THE LATIN ON THE FABRIC!
THE COPS AREN'T GONNA BELIEVE THAT BULLSHIT.
LET'S DO THIS.
WHAT'D YOU GIVE ME?
WHAT YOU DESERVE.
YOU KILLED SARAH?
WE JUST FOUND HER.
WHAT?
BEFORE YOU ARRIVED.
JESUS CHRIST.
I THOUGHT SHE WAS SLEEPING.
VINCENT KNOWS HER?
SHE-SHE LEFT HIM THIS.
SEE YOU IN THE NEXT LIFE.
WHY DID SHE HAVE TO DO IT HERE?
WE GOTTA CALL THE COPS.
THEY-THEY INVESTIGATE SUICIDES.
THIS IS ALL GONNA COME OUT.
AND-AND LEAVE HER THERE?
JESUS!
PHILIP!
COME ON!
WE HAVE TO HELP OUT VINCE.
WHERE THE FUCK IS VINCE?
ISN'T THIS HIS PROBLEM?
AHEMMM.
UM...
BECAUSE I DIDN'T CALL HIM.
YOU DIDN'T CALL HIM?
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL HIM?
THERE'S SOMETHING I HAVE TO SHOW YOU.
YOU'VE BEEN TAPING US?
!
YOU FUCKING PERVERT!
AND WE NEED TO WATCH THIS.
IF WE GET A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT HAPPENED UPSTAIRS...
MAYBE YOU'LL AGREE...
WE SHOULDN'T TAKE THE HIT FOR VINCENT'S FUCKUP.
VINCENT...
VINCENT HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN A GOOD FRIEND.
NO...
MAYBE I ALREADY GOT EVEN...
HEART TO HEART.
THE NIGHT HE WENT TO TALK TO HER.
MARTY.
HE TOOK ADVANTAGE.
WOW!
YOUR LITTLE SISTER IS SERIOUSLY HOT!
HOW LONG HAS...?
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
HOW LONG?
ON A REGULAR BASIS.
HE WAS HER FIRST.
FUCK!
HUH?
THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE...
THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN HURT YOU.
HE PAID ANNE...
TO LET YOU SEDUCE HER.
SO YOU'D WANNA SHARE THE LOFT.
IT WAS PAID FOR.
HAVE FUN.
ALRIGHT?
JUST GO HOME.
CHRIS.
JUST LIKE HE USED EVERYONE.
EVERYONE.
I'M GONNA KILL THAT SON OF A BITCH.
WHEN HE WALKS IN.
WE HAVE TO TRY AND REMAIN CALM.
WE'RE GONNA GET QUESTIONED BY THE COPS.
THAT'S WHY WE CAN NEVER ADMIT WE'RE SHARING THIS LOFT.
THEY'LL TRY TO TURN US AGAINST EACH OTHER.
OK.
I THINK THIS CAN WORK.
AS LONG WE FOLLOW THE PLAN.
CHRIS?
OK.
I'M IN.
THAT VINCENT WAS HERE LAST NIGHT.
I WANNA HEAR HIM SAY IT.
I'LL GO THROUGH WITH IT.
A GLASS...
UNTIL WE KNOW FOR SURE.
UNDERSTOOD?
WE'VE GOT JUST UNDER TWO HOURS TO SET EVERYTHING UP AND ESTABLISH ALIBIS.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.
YOU GUYS GET OUTTA HERE.
MAKE SURE PEOPLE SEE YOU.
RIGHT?
I'VE GOT IT.
YOU KNEW WHAT THAT PRICK WAS UP TO.
AND YOU NEVER SAID ANYTHING.
YOU'RE JUST AS SICK AS VINCENT.
THEY MET HERE ON A REGULAR BASIS.
VINCENT HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN A GOOD FRIEND.
HE STARTED SEEING HER RIGHT AFTER YOUR WEDDING.
HE WAS HER FIRST.
YOU ARE A TOTAL FUCKING PSYCHOPATH.
I DID WHAT YOU TOLD ME.
I DIDN'T TELL YOU TO FUCKING CUT HER OPEN.
IT WASN'T PART OF THE PLAN.
AND THE LATIN ON THE FABRIC!
THE COPS AREN'T GONNA BELIEVE THAT BULLSHIT!
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?
YOU'RE FRAMING ME!
SWALLOW IT.
SWALLOW.
MY OWN FRIENDS.
MY OWN FRIENDS!
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DIE.
SARAH LURED YOU HERE AND DRUGGED YOU.
WITH YOU BY HER SIDE.
FATE WILL UNITE US.
BUT YOU'RE GONNA SURVIVE.
AREN'T WE?
YOU SEE?
IT WAS A SETUP.
SARAH AND I WERE SET UP.
THE WHOLE THING WAS STAGED.
DON'T YOU THINK?
BUT IT'S THE TRUTH.
YEAH.
AND YOU PROVE IT WITH FACTS AND FINDINGS.
WE ONLY FOUND YOUR PRINTS AND THOSE OF SARAH DEAKINS.
BECAUSE THEY WIPED THE PLACE CLEAN.
WITH YOUR PRINTS ALL OVER THEM.
TOUCHED 'EM.
BUT WE'VE GOT NO DVDS OF YOUR FRIENDS.
NO DVDS OF MARTY'S WIFE.
NO DVDS OF PHILIP'S SISTER.
MR. STEVENS.
AND WE GOT NO EVIDENCE THAT YOU WERE BEING SET UP.
ALRIGHT.
IS THERE ANYTHING WE'VE FORGOTTEN?
TO FOLLOW THE FUCKING PLAN.
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST HANDCUFF HER?
SHE WAS ALREADY DEAD.
STILL NO REASON TO MUTILATE HER.
SHE KILLED HERSELF.
I JUST MADE IT MORE DRAMATIC.
YOU BETTER HOPE YOUR DRAMATICS DON'T PUT US IN JAIL.
TOO.
ALRIGHT?
WE QUESTIONED THEM ALL.
I GOT NO REASON TO BELIEVE THEY'VE BEEN LYING.
THEY DON'T.
AT BREAKFAST.
ALRIGHT?
WE WERE ALL IN THE LOFT.
SO WAS PHIL.
WHAT ABOUT PHIL?
WITH HIS FATHER-IN-LAW.
FRY?
WHAT THE FUCK'S FRY DOING HERE?
ALL DAY.
THAT IS BULLSHIT!
THAT IS A FALSE STATEMENT!
AND WHY WOULD HE LIE?
HIRAM FRY BRINGS A LOT OF CREDIBILITY.
OK?
PHIL KNEW THAT.
HE KNEW I PRESSURED FRY INTO GIVING ME A WATERFRONT CONTRACT.
SO YOU TRIED TO BLACKMAIL HIRAM FRY?
ENOUGH OF THIS CRAP.
WE GOT 'EM ALL OVER THE KNIFE.
ALRIGHT?
CALL YOUR LAWYER.
MAKE A CONFESSION AND SAVE YOUR ASS.
YOU'RE FREE TO GO.
I WANNA THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION.
WE HAD TO CHECK OUT YOUR FRIEND'S STORY.
THAT'S YOUR JOB.
THERE'S JUST...
ONE THING THAT'S BOTHERING ME.
WHY DOES VINCENT STEVENS KEEP ACCUSING HIS BEST FRIENDS?
TOO.
COULD IT BE...
I JUST...
I JUST WONDER...
YOU THINK HE'S TRYING TO HIDE SOMETHING ELSE?
WHAT WOULD HE HIDING?
SARAH DEAKINS' MURDER.
MURDER?
CALLED IT A SUICIDE.
THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE.
BUT THE AUTOPSY
REPORT REVEALED THAT SLEEPING PILLS DIDN'T KILL HER.
BUT NOT BY SARAH. BEFORE A SUICIDE ACTUALLY SLASHES THROUGH AN ARTERY.
THE CORONER DIDN'T FIND THOSE ON HER.
UH...
HE WOULD NEVER...
HIS PRINTS ARE ON THE KNIFE.
WE DIDN'T FIND A SUICIDE NOTE.
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?
WE DIDN'T FIND A SUICIDE NOTE.
RIGHT?
I'VE GOT IT...
LUKE.
CHRIS!
YOU SCARED ME.
YOU SURE IT'S SMART...
MEETING HERE?
LUKE.
HOW SO?
WHERE IS SARAH'S SUICIDE NOTE?
YOU PUT IT IN YOUR POCKET.
I DID.
BUT IT'S NOT THERE ANY MORE.
WHEN DID YOU STEAL IT FROM MY COAT?
WHEN THE DOORBELL RANG THIS MORNING?
FROM THE REALTOR?
BUT...
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT.
I CALLED THE AGENCY TO ASK WHO PUT OUR LOFT UP FOR SALE.
ALL THEY COULD GIVE ME WAS A NUMBER.
I DID CALL THEM.
I WANTED TO...
MAYBE THAT...
NOW.
WHY'D THAT NOTE DISAPPEAR?
THE ONLY REAL PROOF OF HER SUICIDE?
HELLO?
SAYS SHE'S GOT AN APPOINTMENT WITH SOMEONE NAMED SARAH DEAKINS?
WHO'S SARAH DEAKINS?
IS IT BECAUSE MAYBE SHE DIDN'T WRITE IT?
MAYBE IT'S YOUR HANDWRITING?
VINCENT FUCKED US ALL.
YOU SAW.
I SAW.
ALL THE DVDS THAT MADE EVERYBODY CRAZY.
DIDN'T IT?
LUKE?
WHAT DID YOU DO TO THAT GIRL?
DID SHE GET IN YOUR WAY?
BETWEEN YOU AND VINCENT?
IT WAS VINCENT...
STANDING BETWEEN US.
IS THERE SOMEONE ELSE?
MUCH...
SARAH!
WAIT.
FORGET VINCENT.
HE'S BETTER AT GAMES THAN YOU.
ALWAYS WILL BE.
HE'S HURTING YOU.
USING YOU.
WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS?
I'M TELLING YOU BECAUSE...
BECAUSE I'D NEVER HURT YOU.
JUST GIVE ME THE CHANCE...
TO SHOW I'D NEVER HURT YOU.
LUKE.
I'M SORRY.
MAYBE IN ANOTHER LIFE.
YOU WERE HERE LAST NIGHT?
BARBARA WAS OFF SKIING.
SO I FIGURED I'D FIND VINCENT HERE...
WITH SARAH.
I'M SORRY.
I WAITED 'TIL HE LEFT.
SHE SAID I WAS RIGHT ABOUT VINCENT.
CONSOLING...
I'VE GOTTEN SO GOOD AT IT.
PAINLESS.
LEAVES NO TRACE.
LUKE.
I DID IT OUT OF LOVE...
I SWEAR.
AND VINCENT TAKING THE FALL FOR THIS.
IT'S OK WITH YOU?
VINCENT USED EVERYONE AND ANYONE!
IT'S ABOUT TIME WE TURNED THE TABLES!
HE'S BEING CHARGED WITH MURDER.
WHEN YOU LEFT HER WITH PHILIP.
YOU'RE LYING.
NO.
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.
WHAT PHILIP DID TO HER...
WAS SICK.
LUKE.
BUT...
IF I'M HEARING YOU RIGHT...
IT WAS YOUR BROTHER...
WHO KILLED SARAH.
CHRIS.
GO HOME.
I'LL CLEAN UP.
LIKE ALWAYS.
NO.
LUKE.
STEP OUTSIDE.
LUKE.
NOW.
PLEASE!
TOO?
IT'S YOUR OWN FAULT.
IF YOU DON'T MIND!
LUKE.
WILL YOU STOP IT?
CHRIS.
I REALLY DON'T.
SO JUST DO IT.
NEVER!
BEFORE I CAME.
I TOLD THEM EVERYTHING.
BULLSHIT!
I KNOW YOU HAVEN'T.
I THOUGHT I KNEW YOU.
TOO?
CHRIS.
GIVE IT TO ME!
LUKE.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT IS OVER.
TELL ALLIE AND THE KIDS...
I'M SORRY.
CHRIS?
CHRIS.
BE A FRIEND.
LUKE!
LUKE!
LUKE!
LUKE!
LUKE!
NO.
THEY'RE HAVING AN AFFAIR.
I'M TELLING YOU THEY'RE HAVING AN AFFAIR.
SINCE WHEN ARE YOU THE BIG EXPERT ON AFFAIRS?
REALLY?
MEEMS.
WHAT WAS MY ALTERNATIVE?
TO LEAVE YOU WAILING AT
WITH SNOT POURING OUT OF YOUR NOSE?
DIDN'T MEAN TO SCARE YOU OFF.
SO I GOTTA GO.
ALONE?
WITH MY WIFE? WE CAN AT LEAST HAVE ONE MORE DRINK.
THERE'LL BE PLENTY MORE DRINKS.
CHRIS.
CHRIS!
ANNE?
HI.
HI.
TOO.
I STILL HAVE THE KEY.
DO YOU WANT IT BACK?
IT WON'T WORK ANYMORE.
NOW.
IT'S THE ONLY THING HIS WIFE LET HIM KEEP.
UH...
AND PHILIP?
HE'S AWAITING TRIAL.
WE'LL SEE.
AND YOU?
YOU DOING OK?
YEAH.
MOST OF THE TIME.
AND THE REST OF THE TIME?
I HEARD YOU DITCHED THE CITY COUNCILMAN?
THAT'S NOT ALL I'VE GIVEN UP.
OR...?
THE END
SUBTITLES BY KOUSHIK DAS
I swear to God I had nothing to do with this.
We would love to believe you, Mr. Stevens, but you have to admit... your version of events does sound pretty bizarre, don't you think?
Look.
It was a setup, okay?
The whole thing was staged.
So you were framed.
That's your claim?
You were the victim.
Well, I mean, you know, not-- not like--
Not like who?
Not like her?
Please, just talk to the other guys.
Have you talked to the others yet?
We're doing our jobs.
So why don't you just do yourself a favor and confess?
Save some time, save some legal fees.
Come on.
Why don't you take us through the events of this morning?
Again?
Again, Mr. Stevens.
Where were you this morning, Mr. Stevens?
I was at home, alone.
My wife's taken the kids skiing.
Actually your wife's on her way back, as we speak.
Apparently, she has, uh, quite a few questions of her own.
So the phone woke you around what time this morning?
I don't know.
Uh, 9:00, 9:30.
It was Luke in a panic.
He said I had to come.
Where were you supposed to go?
To the loft.
He told me to come to the loft.
Did he say why he was panicking?
- No.
- Did you know why he was panicking?
No, not yet.
Luke.
Luke?
Oh, my God.
Oh, fuck.
- What the hell happened?
- I don't know.
What do you mean?
You just-
- What, you--
I walked in, she was lying there.
Oh, fuck.
- Have you called the others?
- Chris and Marty are on their way.
I-
- I still haven't reached Philip.
Okay, well, uh, keep calling.
We need everybody here.
Do you know who she is?
Vincent, do you know who's lying there?
What?
No, of course not.
How the fuck did they get in?
Was it a window, a door or--
Windows are sealed, the door was locked, and the alarm was turned off.
That's impossible.
I'm telling you, the door was locked.
And the alarm was turned off.
But that would mean that--
Someone got in with one of our keys.
Do you know the loft building... at the corner of Second and South Hope, Mr. Seacord?
No.
The new residential one by the Sports Arena?
Designed, I believe, by your good friend Vincent Stevens.
Vincent runs a very large firm.
He's done a lot of buildings.
There's a loft on the ninth floor, Mr. Seacord.
Have you ever been there?
No.
Strange, because according to our information, you and four friends are sharing this loft secretly, without your wives' knowledge.
That is ridiculous.
Don't the five of you bring women up there?
Girlfriends, mistresses, one-night stands, catch of the day.
Five pals just looking for privacy and fun... without the hassle of Visa statements and hotel bills the missus might find.
That is preposterous.
Maybe, Mr. Seacord, but one of your friends already made a full confession.
You want to know who?
Listen, I don't do things like that.
You know?
Fool around with other women.
I--
You love your wife.
I love my wife, yes.
What happened to your face, Mr. Seacord?
- I walked into a door.
- Or were you in a fight?
- I said I walked into a door.
- Where were you this morning?
Out with Chris, having breakfast.
There will be a lot of people in the restaurant to verify that.
By Chris, you mean Dr. Chris Vanowen, the psychiatrist?
- That's right.
- One of your loft buddies?
Chris is married.
He's got two kids.
And he's not a guy who cheats on his wife either.
We've got a serious fuckin' problem, Chris.
Oh, shit.
Philip.
Philip?
You think your brother has something to do with this?
No.
We gotta call the cops.
You realize what'll happen if we call the cops?
- Think about our wives.
- There's a dead woman here, Vincent.
Why do we think Philip is involved?
- Chris, you know what he's capable of.
- Yeah, I know.
Maybe we can help him, okay?
If we can just figure out what the fuck happened, maybe we could--
What?
We gonna dump the body somewhere?
Look, I don't fucking know, but I'm not taking the fall for this!
Marty.
Son of a bitch.
Have you seen Phil?
Do you know where he is?
Was he here last night?
This can't be real.
No.
Wait, what are you doing?
I want to see her.
Just put her back.
- Goddamn it.
- Who is she?
I don't know.
Look, none of us has anything to do with this, right?
Right?
We're gonna find out what happened here, and we will figure a way out.
We're in this together.
We'll get out of it together.
Okay?
'Cause we're friends.
Agreed?
Agreed?
Well, it looks like they'll let anybody in, right?
Congratulations, man.
Thanks.
- This one's really spectacular, very special.
- I appreciate that.
Ally, it's been too long.
You look terrific.
Thank you.
So, uh, what do you think?
Well, it's bold and focused, as always.
- I like it.
- Great.
You made it.
Hi.
Hi.
- Hi, Barbara.
How are you?
- Want to buy yourselves a little condo?
I think Vincent's little condos are a little out of our league.
Right.
You and your puny psychiatrist's salary.
You guys grab a drink and we'll catch up with you later.
All right.
Congrats, bud.
Thanks, man.
One hour tops, and then we're out of here.
Come on, hon.
We just got here.
Man, check out all these babes.
So hot!
It's like they're in violation of the fuckin' fire code.
Marty, calm down.
I see them.
I can also see Mimi, your wife.
Okay, save me, help me, protect me.
What's up, Tubs?
Having too much fun?
Nope.
Just checkin' out the hipster crowd with my pal Luke.
Mm-hmm.
Yeah, if you embarrass me, I'll leave you here all by yourself.
Oh, don't raise my hopes only to dash them.
Hi, Luke.
Where's Ellie?
She was just feeling dizzy.
Ducked out to check her blood sugar.
Hi, Elle.
Do you feel okay?
Oh, I started to feel not so great before, but I'm better now.
We can always go home, sweetie.
Did you hear that? "Sweetie." After she just checked her blood sugar.
That's funny.
That's really good.
I would love to see you deal with something like that if that was me.
Oh, you know, baby.
I'd love to stick you in the ass every day.
How many times have I asked?
Honey?
Lots.
Not now.
You're the shrink, aren't you?
Uh, yeah, that's right.
Chris Vanowen.
Dr. Vanowen.
That's right.
Yes, I remember.
Do we know each other?
No.
You knew my sister.
She was a patient of yours actually.
Sophie?
Sophie Morris?
Oh.
I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
Some people are just born unhappy.
I'm sorry.
Are you buying an apartment?
What?
Um, no.
No, no.
I'm friends with the architect.
Oh.
Are you?
No.
No, I'm here with, uh, Joel Kotkin, the city councilman.
I work for him as sort of a personal assistant.
Oh.
I'm Anne.
Anne Morris.
Very nice to meet you, Anne.
And listen, about your sister--
It's okay.
You couldn't have saved her.
Her mood disorder kind of runs in the family, unfortunately, so--
Well, you're not thinking of doing something stupid, are you, Anne?
Me?
You mean like falling for the wrong man?
Well, I do that all the time.
Everything's all right!
Come on.
Keep partying.
- What are you doing?
- Phil, I should've guessed.
Hey, Vince.
What's up?
Hey.
How are you?
Thanks for comin'.
I'm sorry about this.
She slipped.
No worries.
As long as you're okay.
You all right?
I'm fine.
She's fine.
Let me introduce you to uh, a colleague who works with me at the office.
And this one works with me down at the office.
Or is it the other way around?
Philip.
Oh, my big brother.
How you doin', man?
Friends of Vicky's?
Bridesmaids?
Come on, man.
I'm still single.
What are you doing?
It's not like I don't love my little Vicky.
I love her madly.
You know that.
All right?
It's not like I hate all the other women in the world.
- All right.
Relax.
- There's something I want to show you.
Let's go get Marty and Luke.
Chris.
Gentlemen, welcome to the loft.
Wow.
This is impressive, Vince.
Check out the view.
Then imagine this is our own private oasis right in the heart of downtown.
- What do you mean?
- A place where no one hassles you.
A place you can escape to any time you want.
- So this is your loft?
- No.
It's ours.
If you want it.
What?
Ours?
Think about it.
No messy hotel bills.
No questionable credit card activity.
This would be our secret place... to steal away, discreetly and economically... in these challenging times.
Five-way split.
What do you think?
I don't know.
I'm not like that.
Come on, Chris.
We're men.
We're all a little like that.
Yeah, tell me about it.
Give me your key right now.
Bring your twins up here, give 'em a little private tour.
- You know what they cost?
- How much?
I might have it on me right now.
Seriously.
Think about it.
It's a great investment.
A once-in-a-lifetime golden opportunity.
- I can't stay here.
- Where are you going?
- Luke!
- You cannot freak out right now.
We have to stay together like we said.
All right.
Luke, you need to calm the fuck down.
No!
No!
It's over, Vincent!
It's all gonna come out!
It's not over.
Listen.
We're gonna find out what happened here and fix it.
Okay?
Try Phil again.
This is Philip.
Please leave a message after the tone.
What if he doesn't show?
He could be out of the country by now.
He'll show.
We can't cover for him, Chris.
Not this time.
Guys?
Look at this.
What does it mean?
What does it mean?
You know Latin, Doctor?
Excuse me?
Latin.
Do you know Latin?
I took it premed, yeah.
What's it say on the wall there?
Fatum nos iungebit.
Yeah, I know.
Fatum nos iungebit.
I can read that.
What's it mean?
I'm guessing you already know what it means.
No.
We would like to hear you say it.
You'd like to hear me say it.
Okay.
Fatum nos iungebit.
Fate will unite us.
Now, all I can possibly think is that somebody who knows Latin like you... reached over with this young lady's hand... and wrote "Fatum nos iungebit" on the wall.
"Fatum nos iungebit" is wrong.
How so, Doctor?
The future imperfect tense of the verb unite, iungere... is not iungebit, it's iunget.
It should say "Fatum nos iunget."
So the person you're looking for made a classic Latin error.
But I'm guessing you knew that already too, didn't you?
You know the phrase "Fuck you"?
Germanic origin.
- Where's your brother?
- I'm sorry.
I can't help you with that one.
Right.
Actually, he's your half-brother, isn't he?
Same mother, different fathers.
He spent some time in various institutions with your half-sister Zoe?
Yeah, that's right.
After our mother died,
Philip wasn't-- wasn't as lucky with his father.
Apparently not.
Alcoholic child beater.
You didn't spend much time with Philip back then, did you?
- No.
- But now you're best friends.
We've had a lot of catching up to do.
You really don't know where we can find him?
Fate will unite us?
Where the hell's your brother, Chris?
I don't know.
What the hell is this?
- Where the fuck is Philip?
- I'm right here.
- What the hell's going on?
- You did this.
- You did this!
- Luke!
Luke, Luke!
- Luke!
Come here!
Hey!
Hey!
- Hands off!
Come on.
Bring it on!
- Cool it.
- What is this?
- Luke.
- Shit.
- Did you have anything to do with this?
- What you talkin' about?
- Just answer the fucking question!
Did you do this?
- Of course not!
- Jesus Christ.
Were you here last night?
No, man, I wasn't here last night.
I slept at my in-laws.
You don't believe me, call Vicky.
What about this morning?
Were you here this morning?
I was at a project site, all right?
With my father-in-law.
My God.
Where were you last night?
- Where've you been?
- Philip, take it easy.
Before accusing everyone else, where have you been?
'Cause I never got a text saying the loft was taken.
Never.
- Last night, I was at home.
- Can you prove it?
No, I can't prove it 'cause Barbara's taken the kids skiing.
- You'll have to take my word for it.
- Your word?
There's a dead woman in our loft that only us have access to.
Now, if anybody has anything to do with this, now's the time to say it, right now.
♪♪
Thank you for coming.
Philip's got a ball and chain now.
Who would have thunk it?
Who's the father-in-law again?
His name's Hiram Fry.
He's a huge property developer.
His friends call him "the man of steel."
Worth millions.
Think she's his only daughter.
So what's not to love?
I just hope Philip will be happy.
Hi, you!
- Well, that's cozy.
- What?
Ever since Councilman Kotkin got elected, the man of steel's been busy rebuilding downtown.
Kotkin came to your opening, right?
Yeah, he turned up for a photo op.
When it comes to handing out permits and contracts though, the game's rigged.
Tell me what we're talking about again 'cause I just saw some mini cheesecakes.
Gorgeous, huh?
I mean, this whole setup.
Whoever said money can't buy happiness sure hasn't lived this life.
♪♪
Sorry, boys.
You lost your bachelor mascot.
He's all mine now.
Good luck with breaking this bronco, Vicky.
God knows others have tried.
- But I'm not others, am I, Philip?
- She told you!
It's not just me.
Philip's married into the Fry family now.
Soon as we're back from Fiji.
Yeah.
Well, gonna sell some properties with Vicky's dad.
You know, see how it grabs me.
Wow.
Grabs you.
Well, guys, thanks for coming.
Congratulations.
Come on.
I'll be with you in a second, baby.
I need a break from all the ass-kissing.
Shit.
Where is Fiji?
I don't know, man.
You look gorgeous!
Phil?
Your wedding present.
- Are you for real?
- Absolutely.
Don't lose it.
There's only five of these in existence.
Accepting a key to the loft means you accept the rules to the loft.
Marty?
Wow.
What, are you crazy?
Our wives are here.
Don't you think that's a bit cynical, handing those things out here?
Cynical?
It's just a key to a room.
You should check it out.
Oh, no, you're not like that.
Not now.
Maybe later.
What about you, Luke?
Now or later?
Come on.
That-a-boy.
Oh, wow.
You just make sure this doesn't blow up in your faces.
How's it gonna blow up in our face?
It's just a room, like Vince said.
Our room.
Now, we keep it to ourselves, all right?
Tell nobody.
It just stays within our circle.
Marty?
Yeah?
Yeah.
You just need to find someone willing to go with you, Marty.
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, yeah.
I think there's, uh, plenty choices right here.
Some of these guys bring some premium-grade high-test pussy.
Like that little dewy-eyed vixen right there.
- She looks underage.
- No, she's 20.
One of you guys messes with her, I'm gonna crack your head wide open.
What, do you got dibs on Miss Curly Locks?
Listen, man.
That's Zoe, all right?
Zoe?
Yeah.
Like as in skin-and-bones tomboy Zoe?
- Yeah.
- Oh!
I hate to say it, Phil, but your little sister's seriously hot.
Thanks, man.
She's not little anymore.
- That is the finest piece of ass--
- Marty, that's enough.
I'm just saying, I'd like to fuck her like an animal.
- Come on, Marty.
That's enough.
- Feel her from the inside.
♪ I want to fuck you like an animal ♪
You don't sing.
You don't laugh.
You don't talk about my sister.
Got it?
- Got it?
- Ow!
Don't fuck with me!
You watch it.
You watch it.
Kick your ass at your own fucking wedding.
- Hi.
- Hi.
We met at the, uh-- the building opening.
That's right.
You're Anne Morris.
I'm glad you remember me, Chris.
Hmm.
I see you work weekends.
What a dedicated personal assistant.
What a lucky city councilman.
Screw him.
Do you?
Does it get a bit boring walking around all these parties by yourself?
He wants you close, but not too close.
Not when there's important people around.
I told you I fall for the wrong men.
Can you keep a secret?
Our city councilman... likes to keep my panties with him at these events, in his pocket.
It's a turn-on for him-- the thought of me in a crowd so naked.
Only he knows.
Why do you let him use you like that?
Who says he's using me?
Maybe it turns me on.
Maybe me telling you about it turns me on even more.
I hope you don't catch cold.
Chris.
Chris, I'm sorry.
I don't know.
Maybe I was testing you.
I don't need to be tested.
Listen, do you want to maybe get a cup of coffee... someplace quiet... private?
I'd like to use your key.
Just once.
It's not what you think.
Hey, it doesn't matter what I think.
Have fun.
- Does everyone still have a key?
- Course we do.
It's crucial we get this right.
Five keys were cut.
To make a sixth, you'd need the code, which is in my safe, so we can rule that out.
But there was no break-in.
So does everyone still have a key?
What, you think we've been givin' away our keys?
It's against your rules, Vince.
Then show me.
What are we trying to prove here?
Look, I don't know.
Maybe someone's lost a key, okay?
Let's just rule that out.
Okay?
Look.
Here's mine.
All right?
Chris?
- You didn't use a key to get in just now.
- No.
I didn't bring it.
- Where is it?
I don't have it on me.
It's not like I need it every day, like some of you guys.
But you do still have it?
Vincent, whether or not I have my key on me right now is really not important.
It's extremely fucking' important.
Someone got in using a key, and yours is missing!
Is that right, Vincent?
Then how do you account for the fact that the alarm was shut off?
So let's just cut the bullshit, 'cause it definitely had to be one of us five.
Unless--
Unless what?
Unless she let him in.
Oh, yeah?
Then how'd she get in, Vincent?
Any way you look at it, it keeps coming back down to us.
And I, for one, would like to know who's hiding something.
Where did you learn that?
I seriously don't believe it.
There's a word for that?
Yes.
Polyamory.
It's a philosophy, some sort of belief system... about being romantically involved with more than one person at the same time.
Uh-huh.
And your boss gets away with that?
Yes.
He says that he's in love with his wife and his girlfriend, so why should he have to choose?
- And his wife is amazingly cool with it.
- Oh, really?
Is she special needs?
Maybe oxygen-deprived?
What?
- Explain.
I'd like to know.
- This sounds like my kinda philosophy.
Barbara, what's it called again?
Polly and Marie?
Please.
Spare us, Tubs.
You can barely handle one woman.
What would you do with two?
Mmm.
Bury one.
I would make up something, some sort of game... that involves two ladies and one guy.
Start a trapeze act or somethin'.
Could you at least fake some enthusiasm?
It's your party.
Anyway, I'm cooking.
If you absolutely have to invite your friends over, could you at least try to make it home on time?
Look, they're never here, okay?
Will you just join us?
I just hope the pudgy clown doesn't puke on the rug.
He's been chugging vodka like it's Evian.
I mean, doesn't his wife see that?
Actually, she was just cool with it long enough to catch him in the act.
She hired a detective.
Cell phone records, credit card receipts.
Audio, video, the works.
And in a heartbeat, my poor boss went from polyamory to alimony.
Oh.
Man, your boss sounds mentally retarded.
So, what-- what happened to him?
Oh.
Uh, he and his concubine are now cramped in a tiny one-bedroom condo.
But I'm guessing he's happy.
She's blonde, 23, with a brand-new pair of fake breasts.
Oh!
How can men stand fake breasts?
Ah!
Why are women always talking about "fake tits" this, "fake tits" that?
I mean, listen.
Girls, if it's a decent boob job, who fuckin' cares.
You know?
My mom-
- My mom, she's got, uh, false teeth.
Okay?
When she smiles, do people give her shit and say,
"Oh, my God!
Look!
Fake!"
No, they don't.
They say, "Wow!
You look way better now.
It's an improvement."
You know, you women, you're so catty, so competitive.
Calm down, Tubby dearest.
You know what?
No, it's nothin' to be calm about, Mimi.
I mean, a glorious, big set of fuckin' tits... and a nice piece of ass, it's-it's thrilling!
It's thrilling!
This is all a little too highbrow for my teeny, tiny, catty female mind.
Oh, well, you know what?
You should have that enlarged.
Huh?
And while you're under, you should have the corners of your mouth lifted... so you can smile every once in a while.
Sorry.
Sorry, Chris.
What?
What?
Marty.
Marty.
- Come on.
- No.
No, you're a class act, Marty.
Mimi, would you like to get your husband another drink or should I do the honors?
You should do it.
And I want it chilled.
- And then you go with her and stir.
- Honey?
The problem with your boss, Barbara, is he didn't have his shit together.
I mean, apart.
Apart, I mean.
He did-
- No, I mean he didn't compartmentalize.
You guys agree?
All right, Marty.
How would you compartmentalize?
How?
Okay.
Well, since you ask.
First thing first is I wouldn't have a place that you could get caught.
Not a hotel, not your girlfriend's crib.
That's key, right?
Am I right, Vinnie boy?
Am I right?
Marty, you've lost us all.
I doubt that!
I doubt that, Vinnie boy.
But it-
- Okay, first of all-- Sorry, baby.
I would just get a little-- you know, a little one-bedroom condo... or something like that.
- Whoa, whoa!
- Goddamn it!
Oh.
You all right?
Mimi, your husband tends to talk out of his ass when he's been drinking.
Yeah?
All right.
There we go.
Hon, would you give me a hand?
Sure.
- Sorry.
Didn't know you were in here.
- Yeah, no problem.
Ate too much too fast, I guess.
Thai food, you know.
Yeah, it gets all up in your nose and shit.
- Yeah.
It's a little spicy.
- Yeah.
I'm outta here.
Bye.
- I need to pick up some more insulin.
- Luke?
Is there something you wanna tell me?
Are you keeping secrets?
What kind of secrets?
Is there someone else?
I don't know why you start asking me silly questions, but the answer is no.
I'm not cheating on you, Ellie.
That's not what I'm asking, Luke.
I'm asking if there's someone else.
Listen, sweetie.
Whatever I may be or may not be-- and I know I'm not as glamorous as some-- but I'll always be there for you and the children.
I don't know what I'd do without you.
I want you to know... there's a lot I could put up with.
What are you doing?
We need to get her out of here.
How?
She is shackled to the bed!
Can't you guys see what's going on?
Someone is trying to frame us.
Who?
Who wants to frame us?
I don't know.
But think about it.
The body's cuffed to the bed.
It's impossible to move.
The Latin, the knife.
Someone did this for a reason.
The cops could be here any second.
None of us know who this girl is.
We don't even know how she got in here.
Who else knew about the arrangement?
Who else knows about our arrangement?
Did anyone blab, tell one of the girls that have been up here?
Marty?
What?
Why me?
- Some night you were hammered?
- I've always followed the rules, Vincent.
Did you give anyone your code?
Did you key in while someone was watching?
Absolutely not.
I just told you.
Wait.
What's your point, Vincent?
Where are you going with this?
- Someone is trying to set us up.
- Like who?
I don't know.
A rejected girlfriend.
A jealous boyfriend.
Betrayed husband.
Someone with a motive.
Look.
Is one of you guys in some kind of trouble?
I think I may be falling in love with you.
You don't have to say that.
No, but I mean it.
Why would you say that, Chris?
Why would you even feel it?
I've never cheated on my wife before.
And I don't fall in love easily.
Chris, I don't want you to love me.
You don't even know me... apart from these stolen moments.
I mean, they're exciting, yeah, sure, but... they're just moments.
Let's change that.
I wanna see you more often--
Chris, please.
- and not just for this.
- No, stop it.
I don't want you to love me.
Well, I don't wanna keep sneaking around.
I'm gonna tell Alison about us.
No, you're not.
Yes, I am.
Anne.
I'm gonna leave her.
Stop it!
Why are you doing this?
The people you love, they're the only ones who can hurt you.
I would never hurt you, Anne.
Stop.
Stop what?
I don't know what you're talking about.
Would you--
Stop it, okay?
You don't know me.
That's the end of it.
No.
- Would you give me a chance, at least--
- I'm a whore.
All right?
What?
I'm a prostitute.
I fuck men for money.
Do you get it now?
Don't worry, Doctor.
I won't bill you for the past few months.
Please, Anne, would you wait?
Would you wait a minute?
Chris, please stop it.
You don't know the half of it.
Just go home.
Go home to your wife and your kids.
Is your friend Chris Vanowen cheating on his wife, Mr. Landry?
Oh, I doubt that.
Chris is a very devoted husband and, um--
And a model dad, just like all the rest of your pals, right?
Except for you.
You're not exactly squeaky clean, are you, Marty?
Um, I don't know what you mean.
- Why does your wife want a divorce?
- Divorce?
That's not right.
What we're going through is a separation.
It's a trial separation.
Why?
Because she found out something that she, uh, wasn't too happy about.
- You fucked around on her.
- If you wanna be technical.
How'd she find out?
- The woman with whom I--
- Fucked around?
Yeah.
Apparently expected something a little more, and she showed up on our front porch.
The bitch started to--
The woman in question started saying things.
And my only hope is that Mimi will come around eventually, because I love her very much.
Did you go with this woman up to the loft?
What?
No.
This happened in San Diego.
Oh, that's where you met the woman, right?
In San Diego.
- Yeah.
- Why were you there?
A commercial real estate convention.
Vince had a couple extra tickets.
A VIP thing, you know.
It's a couple nights in a fancy hotel and a chance to get away for a couple days.
And nights.
Yeah.
Nights too.
Man, do you see that?
Jesus, Vince.
Those girls are drooling all over you.
Invite 'em over.
You got first dibs.
I'm happy with second best too.
He's cute.
See him?
I'll take a rain check on that.
What?
What, are you fucking crazy?
Why wouldn't you invite them over?
'Cause, Marty, I'd rather dive for some rare and exotic sea creature... than shoot fish in a barrel.
Does Barbara know about these deep-sea expeditions of yours?
- Are you kidding me?
- Yeah.
What's your problem, Seacord?
You got a key to the loft.
What do you do up there, your laundry?
Dishes?
Hey, are you guys here on business or what?
I'm Dana.
My first time here.
It's a little overpriced for what you get, don't you think?
Hi, Dana.
I'm Vincent.
This is, uh, Marty, Luke.
Can we, uh, buy you a drink?
Hey, when I said "overpriced," I wasn't trolling for free booze.
- No, I mean, I didn't think--
- Since you asked, what are you drinking?
Oh, champagne?
A girl can dream.
- Champagne?
- Please.
All right.
One champagne coming up.
What are you doing?
The fat chick's gonna scare off all the hot chicks.
Marty.
Every fat chick has a good-looking friend.
Hers is probably on her way down right now.
Okay.
Yeah, well, what if she is the good-looking friend... and the really fat chick's on her way down?
I think that's Philip's father-in-law.
Oh.
Yeah, it is.
I'll be.
That's the man of steel, all right.
But that ain't Mrs. Steel.
Think we should give him a key?
Maybe.
Not mine.
I'd like a bottle of your finest champagne and four glasses, please, at the table in the corner.
You, uh, were at my daughter's wedding.
Philip's friends.
You're the architect.
Vincent Stevens.
We should talk sometime, Mr. Stevens.
Sure.
What do you got in mind, Mr. Fry?
We have a new waterfront project.
It's massive.
It's cutting-edge.
It might be right up your alley.
Of course, it's all preliminary, and we have to keep it under wraps.
I hope you can be discreet.
Sure.
Discretion, Mr. Stevens.
That's the main thing.
Dictum sapienti sat est.
A word to the wise.
You are wise?
Yeah, sure.
Wise-- Wise and discreet, Mr. Fry.
I'm in software.
I can be discreet myself, and wise.
I'll pick up their tab as well.
Uh, have a nice evening, gentlemen.
Fantastic.
Oh, they're right over here.
Sweetheart?
Sweetheart?
Excuse me.
Hi, this is Anne.
Leave a message.
Who are you calling at this hour?
I wasn't.
I was just checkin' my voice mail.
And what does your voice mail say?
That you're a lousy liar, Chris Vanowen?
What are you talk-- Is something wrong?
You tell me, Chris.
- Alison, I--
- I'm going to bed.
Alison!
Excuse me.
That's not thinking.
It's called following your dick around.
Okay, two kinds of articles in Cosmo month after month--
One: men are pigs.
Two:
How do I seduce a pig to chop my wood?
I don't read Cosmo month after month.
Well, I do.
I don't.
Well, I do.
And I find it strangely compelling.
You know what I find strangely compelling?
What?
Your eyebrows.
Lumberjack contest.
Oh.
I can't leave you alone for a minute.
Sarah.
It's been more like an hour.
Thank God I've been subsidized.
Aren't you going to introduce me to your new friends?
And that was the first time you met her?
Yeah, that was, uh--
That was the first time.
Sarah?
Yeah.
Her name was Sarah.
Mr. Stevens, what else happened in San Diego?
What do you want to know?
Everything.
I got another one!
No!
No!
Shh!
Keep it down.
Keep it down.
This is insane, Sarah.
You should never dare a crazy woman.
Vincent, we should probably go back.
Luke, lighten up.
It's okay.
Mmm.
Mmm.
Said I'd get you to the pool.
Now you have to keep your end of the bargain.
Come over here.
Let's sit down.
Yeah.
Oh!
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Come on.
Don't keep us waiting.
Take it off.
- Think I'm gonna be sick.
- What?
Vince's body's not that bad.
Not Vince, the shrimp cocktail!
What?
Dana!
Dana!
Come-
- Come back.
Come back here!
Your turn.
No.
Take it all off.
Not bad.
Is this still too scary for you, Luke?
Are you gonna join us?
I'm-- I'm fine right here.
But I need you, 'cause Vincent's gonna try and make a move on me soon.
And if you're here, maybe he won't dare.
Well, maybe Vincent's not interested.
Maybe Vincent would rather do laps.
That would explain the last few hours of casual-but-meaningful glances... that each lasted a second too long.
You like to play games, huh?
Tsk.
I do.
And I'll tell you something else:
I'm better at it than you.
Can you feel me?
Most definitely.
Marty?
Marty, I need my room key.
Dude!
I'm kinda busy here.
Don't stop!
Go!
I'm not stopping.
Just do it!
Oh!
You're scared, is what it is.
You're running away from your feelings.
I don't want to say good-bye.
Do you have any idea what it's like to really love someone?
I'm sorry.
What are you doing?
Throwing it away.
It's empty.
You were here yesterday, weren't you?
Guys?
We gotta go to the cops.
We're not getting anywhere with this.
First, I think Vincent has something to tell you.
All right, let's hear it.
What the hell?
- Hello?
- Who is it?
Who is it?
It's a Realtor who wants to come up.
Somebody listed the loft for sale?
- What?
- Oh, Jesus fucking--
Listed the loft?
She said she has an appointment with a Deakins, Sarah Deakins.
Who-
- Who's Sarah Deakins?
Wait.
Who the hell is trying to sell our loft?
You know her, Marty.
- What?
- You know her, and so does Luke.
Sarah Deakins is lying on the bed.
You guys, I promise, I've never seen a Sarah Deakins.
- That's not true.
You know her.
- Why do you keep saying that?
You met her in San Diego the last night in the bar.
Remember?
Dana's friend.
The last night?
I was wasted outta my mind.
The whole night's a blur.
Jesus!
Luke, you remember her, don't you?
That's Sarah?
You remember Sarah.
You remember her, right?
Yes.
I remember Sarah.
But how was I supposed to know that's Sarah?
Come on, guys.
What the hell's going on?
You guys turned her over and looked at her face.
I did not.
Yeah.
I think there's been a mistake.
We don't know anyone named Sarah Deakins.
Marty.
Come on!
- Who is it?
Do we know her?
- I don't know.
Fuck.
So is that all you wanted to tell us, Vince?
Or is there more?
I had a thing with her.
I brought her up here a couple of times.
But I swear on my kids, I had nothing to do with this.
Would you just fuckin' tell me?
Were you here with her last night?
Were you the one who let her in?
I broke up with her last night.
I swear she was alive when I left.
It still doesn't explain why someone listed the loft!
Something special or just browsing?
Why don't you return my phone calls?
If you're dumping me, at least have the decency--
Chris, how can I dump you?
There's nothing between us.
So that's what it meant to you?
Nothing?
Did you forget what I told you already?
Who I am, what I do?
No.
I haven't.
It doesn't change how I feel about you.
How many women have you taken to that fuck pad you share with your four buddies?
What?
Please, Chris.
Save it for some girl who'll actually buy your bullshit.
Anne, no, wait.
Wait.
You know I'm not like that.
Here.
I only need this if I'm with you, so you keep it.
If you wanna see me again, you let me know.
Chris?
Um, what are you doing here?
Shopping for Alison?
Uh, no.
No, um, I was just here with a colleague.
Does your wife know you've been sharing the loft with your pals?
I already told you, I'm not sharing a loft with any pals.
I was there just once, at a party, when the building first opened.
Then you have been there.
A minute ago, you didn't even know where the building was.
I never took anyone up there.
I thought that's what you meant.
Well, did you know the girl?
We met once in San Diego.
Are you aware that Mr. Stevens began a relationship with her in San Diego?
That would surprise me, frankly.
You didn't know?
Isn't Vincent Stevens your best friend?
It's so obvious what you're trying to do here.
You're trying to turn us against each other.
But guess what?
I'm not about to start trashing my friend.
Is it possible, Mr. Seacord, that you are jealous of your best friend... when he's nailing all these beautiful women?
I am a married man.
I'm not interested in nailing women.
I'm not jealous of Vincent.
Oh, no.
I didn't mean jealous of him, Mr. Seacord.
I meant jealous of the women.
Where do you get off with an innuendo like that?
Fucking bastards.
Why are you so angry, Mr. Seacord?
Vincent is my closest friend.
And he has been for years.
Yeah, fine.
But your best friend is selling you out as we speak, Mr. Seacord.
You and the rest of your gang.
No.
Vincent would never sell out his friends.
You're full of shit, asshole.
What'd you call me?
You heard me, you lying piece of shit!
I broke up with her and I left!
That's it!
Yeah?
- After you cut her up with this.
Right?
- Put the knife down!
- I didn't kill her.
- Back off.
- What?
- Put the knife-- Put the knife down!
Back off.
What?
What?
The loft was listed in her name.
That's not a coincidence.
- Someone's trying to pin this on us.
- On you, you mean.
Jesus!
Get a fuckin' grip!
Fuck!
Guys, we cannot keep doing this.
Well, what do you wanna do, Marty?
Huh?
Just leave me hanging?
Hey, Vince?
Vince?
Are you in there?
If you're in there, hey, man, I need to talk to you for just a second.
Christ, Marty, I've got company.
Didn't you get my text?
Mimi's gone.
She's gone.
Fucking gone.
What do you mean "gone"?
Gone where?
She left me.
She found out about San Diego.
That dumpy chick, she showed up and then told her everything.
Fuck!
Wait a minute.
You didn't tell Mimi about the loft?
What?
It's not about the goddamn loft, Vince!
It's about my wife!
I don't know what I'm gonna do without her!
Did you-- Did you confess?
Then never confess, Marty.
Never confess.
Would you go to her and just-- just tell her that I love her?
You know?
And that Dana's lying?
She'll believe you.
Marty, I will straighten this out for you.
I promise you I will straighten this out.
Okay.
Hey, come here.
Okay.
Thanks.
Okay, so what's the plan?
What do we do now?
We get her out of here.
We can't just make a body disappear.
That's too bad.
It's our only hope.
You had a relationship with her.
Now she's some inconvenient piece of evidence?
- What kind of man are you?
- That's a laugh, coming from you.
And how do you plan to get her off the bed?
Cut off her hand?
Or do you have the key to those cuffs?
I thought handcuffs were more your thing than mine, Phil.
Meaning what?
You know exactly what I mean.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Just keep your fuckin' mouth shut!
All right?
Please help-- help me!
Please help me!
Keep that fucking mouth shut!
He's crazy!
This fucking whore's trying to rip me off!
- Please help me!
He raped me!
- Shut up!
Hey.
Hey.
Easy, easy!
What?
- All right.
All right.
- It's gonna be okay.
He's crazy!
Shit.
Okay, okay.
- Philip, give me the keys.
- Bitch is gonna go to the cops, man.
- The keys.
- She's gonna go to the cops!
The keys!
You want the key?
- Shit.
- He made me do things I didn't want to do.
Shut up!
Shut up!
Easy.
Easy.
What?
You want more money?
That's it, right?
It's all about the money, huh?
It's all about the fucking money!
Here's your fucking money!
It's right there!
Jesus Christ.
What the fuck is the matter with you?
Have you lost your fucking mind?
She's a whore, Chris!
Do you know what a whore is?
Shut up!
- You can't rape a whore!
- Shut up!
- You can't rape a--
- Shut up!
You don't treat a woman like that!
You got it?
Not any woman!
- Don't fuckin' touch me!
- What the fuck's the matter with you?
You're putting us all at risk!
I want police.
He-
- He hit me.
Shut--
- He raped me!
- Shut up!
Stop screaming, or I'm gonna rip your goddamn throat out!
I've had it with you.
You're no better than your father.
- I'm what?
- You heard me.
Oh, right, Chris.
That's a nice one.
Chris had a better deal with his daddy, right?
The great guy who wants to save everyone.
Where were you... when Zoe and I were getting beat up?
And Mom in the next room... pretending not to hear.
Where were you?
In your cozy college dorm... getting laid and wasted 'cause you didn't give a fuck!
I didn't know anything about it.
You didn't give a crap!
All those years we didn't exist for you!
I didn't know anything about it!
If you would've said something--
Then what, you phony?
Then what?
Then I would've gotten you out of there, goddamn it!
Both of you!
Listen.
I'm really, really sorry, but we can't go to the cops.
Here's what I'm gonna do.
I have a friend.
He's a doctor.
- No.
- Yes.
I'm gonna drive you to him.
He's gonna take care of you.
Okay?
No.
No.
Here.
Listen.
Take it.
I know it's not enough for what happened tonight, but--
He's an animal.
He should be locked up!
And we're gonna deal with him, I promise you.
Come on.
Get your clothes.
I'm gonna take you to the doctor.
- No!
- Easy.
Here we go.
No.
I'll never forgive you for this.
Never!
What's the problem?
Jesus Christ!
Why don't I know anything about this?
- And when did it happen?
- A couple of weeks ago.
We decided to keep it to ourselves 'cause that's the kind of friends we are.
Don't lecture me, all right?
Especially about friendship.
Yeah, yeah, right.
Sorry.
I meant to give you the cokehead rapist lecture.
Fuck you.
Well, look.
You can see how I think you'd be involved in this.
I need to say something.
Oh, shit.
You had that coming!
Hey, come on!
Get up!
Relax.
Take it easy.
- You son of a bitch.
- You recorded everything that went on here.
- Every woman--
- Not every.
Not always.
Just... sometimes.
At least I don't cheat on my wife.
No, you just watch us and beat off.
- You sick fuck.
- You're a sick fuck!
Luke, did you record last night?
No.
You didn't say you were coming, which is against your rules.
And that wasn't the first time you broke your own rules, by the way.
Now you're scared, aren't you?
Now you know I've documented pretty much everything you've been up to here.
No worries, Vincent.
I'll keep my mouth shut, like I always do.
Did you see anything that can help us out here?
Anything at all?
If all the people who've been hurt and cheated on find out the truth, what do you think'll happen, Vincent?
What's the matter?
I just don't feel like leaving tomorrow.
Serious?
You love skiing.
Yes, I love to ski, but just not by myself.
Are you sure you can't come?
Babe, you know I can't come.
I can't just take off right now.
Hey.
I'll call you every day.
I love you.
I know the drill.
One hour, right?
Wrong.
Have a blast.
Don't mind me.
Why should tonight be any different from the past few months?
If it's all right with you, I'd rather not spoil tonight.
I'm sure it must be tempting to grab something shiny and new.
But do you ever think about what you might stand to lose, Chris?
You could ruin a lot more than just this evening.
Tell me.
Are you so happy, Alison?
Well, what do you know?
If it's for charity, my mother-in-law is allowed to join the party for a little while.
Heard anything about the waterfront project?
No.
He's gonna call once he gets his permits.
Now, as far as I know, everything's approved.
Really?
Yeah.
Good evening, gentlemen.
Ladies, you look absolutely ravishing tonight.
Thank you.
This is Vincent Stevens.
He's the architect who designed the new loft building near the sports arena.
Oh, wonderful.
I love that building.
Why, thank you, Mrs. Kotkin.
I really appreciate that.
As I was saying to your husband in San Diego, gentlemen in our business can't afford to be exposed... to the negative consequences of bad design.
Speaking of, uh, San Diego, how's that waterfront project coming along?
Ah, yes.
Uh, we're still working on it.
We've applied for all our permits and now we're waiting.
Standing in line like everyone else.
You don't strike me as the type of man that stands in line, Mr. Fry.
What about you, Mr. Kotkin?
Are you a gambling man?
And you, Mr. Stevens?
You like to take chances?
As a matter of fact, I do.
Especially when I'm holding a handful of hearts.
Anyway, I don't mean to interrupt.
Ladies, if you're as lucky on the tables tonight as you are in love, then I am sure you'll hit your jackpots.
Gentlemen, always a pleasure.
- Blackjack!
- Wow!
Set aside enough for the "ali-money."
Mimi, what are you doin' here?
-Just 'cause I booted you out doesn't mean I'm stuck at home.
-I want to come back.
I know I screwed up once.
Once.
But I was drunk off my ass.
I swear it didn't mean a damn thing.
Something I don't understand about men.
If it doesn't mean anything, why bother?
I promise I'll change.
Into what?
A frog?
Certainly not a prince.
How about the ass you already are?
What if I told you I wanted to fuck around tonight?
Sorry.
It would hurt like hell, wouldn't it?
Hey, maybe I already got even.
Maybe with one of your pals.
Maybe Chris.
He's cute.
Or how about Vincent?
The night you sent him over for that tragic heart-to-heart.
"Marty's really suffering, man.
Mimi, you've gotta talk to him."
Blackjack!
Oh!
Well, look at that, Tubs.
Your first-ever winning streak.
Just remember, dear heart...
half of it is mine.
Whoo!
I love you!
You gave Zoe a ticket for tonight?
Philip, let go.
I keep her away from bullshit like this, and then behind my back--
Christ, Phil, she's almost 20 years old.
What are you, her father?
Did you see her?
She looks like a whore.
I thought you like whores.
Yeah.
Let her have some fun.
I'm about to have some fun too.
I'm kind of on a roll.
Yeah?
Yeah, yeah.
I hope you win big-time.
You'll need it with all the shit you've been packin' up your nostrils.
So you noticed a tiny fraction of your stash went missing?
If you don't like it, file for a divorce.
I haven't ruled that out.
Don't forget about our prenup, loser.
Go play some blackjack.
Could be your last best chance at paying the rent.
Can I get some dice over here?
Hands off.
Excuse me.
Anne?
Anne?
We need to talk.
Yeah?
About what?
Your pal the architect.
He's playing with fire.
I'd actually rather talk about Anne.
I'll pass along your message to Vincent, but I'd like something too, Mr. Kotkin.
I'd like for you to stop seeing Anne.
And why would I do that?
Because I love her.
Then we have more in common than we thought.
I'd like you to stop paying her.
I want you to let her go.
That's really not up to me.
Fact is, it's totally her choice.
Except I never paid for her.
Well, that's true.
You never paid.
Stop it, Joel.
I'm going.
What did he mean by that-- "You never paid"?
I don't want to love you, Chris.
Someone's paying you to be with me?
- You're the only one who can hurt me.
- Anne?
Tell me it's a lie.
The first time, it was paid for.
Every other time, that was real, that was me.
But who paid?
I can't--
Excuse me.
Come on, Zoe, let's go.
I'm fine here.
I'm asking you to come with me.
And I'm asking you to stop.
- Did you not hear the lady?
- Mind your business.
- Stop!
- Are you deaf or just a dick?
Huh?
I don't know, man.
What does it say up here?
"Deaf" or "dick"?
Help me out.
Huh?
Stop!
Stop!
Leave him alone!
Fuck!
- Come on!
- You filthy piece of shit!
- Excuse me.
- You're just like Dad!
- You are just like him!
- Somebody get this guy an ambulance.
I never want to see you again.
Not in my home and not near my daughter.
Do you got that?
Get him the hell out of here.
Okay, folks!
Let's get back to the gaming tables, shall we?
Hey.
It's okay.
I'm sorry.
Hey, it's okay.
It's not what you're thinking.
And what am I thinking?
She's my friend's sister.
Okay?
Are there more besides me, her and your wife?
What's the grand total?
Look, I can't have this conversation here.
Barbara's standing right over there.
Do you love me?
Of course I love you.
I'm crazy about you.
But would you choose me if you could?
You know it's not that simple.
Come meet me in the loft tomorrow, okay, and we'll talk it through.
You're right.
It's not that simple.
But maybe I can make it simple.
What do you mean?
Maybe I can help you make that choice.
Sarah.
Sarah.
Sarah.
Sarah.
I'm sorry.
Are you all right?
Don't do it, Sarah.
You'll regret it.
They found out.
Our wives, they-- they set us up.
Why, Vincent?
They--
They found out.
They found out about the loft.
Why would you do it, Vincent?
We're your friends.
- No.
- Why did you do it?
No.
It was... our wives.
They-
- They found out.
No, it's your friends.
We found out.
- What's going on?
- You still don't get it.
All right, strip him.
What are you doing?
- You are a total fucking psychopath.
- I did what you told me.
I didn't tell you to fucking cut her open!
That wasn't a part of the plan.
And the Latin on the bed?
Like the cops are gonna believe that bullshit.
- Then you should've done it yourself.
- Come on.
Let's do this.
What'd you give me?
What you deserve.
You--
You killed Sarah?
No.
We just found her.
What?
We were here this morning, Vincent, before you arrived.
No.
Jesus Christ.
At first I thought she was sleeping.
And Vincent knows her?
She-- She left him this.
"See you in the next life."
Why did she have to do it here?
We gotta call the cops.
They investigate suicides.
This is all gonna come out.
Guys, wait.
Can't we find out where she lives and-- and leave her there?
Jesus.
Philip.
We have to help out Vince.
Speaking of which, where the fuck is Vince?
Isn't this his problem?
Hmm.
Vincent isn't here because, uh-- because I didn't call him.
You didn't call him?
Why didn't you call him?
There's something I have to show you.
You've been taping us?
You fucking pervert!
You can beat the crap out of me later.
We don't have much time, and you need to watch this.
Maybe you'll get a new perspective on what happened upstairs.
Maybe you'll agree we shouldn't take the hit for Vincent's fuckup.
You see, Vincent--
Vincent hasn't always been a good friend.
No.
Oh, God!
Hey, maybe I already got even.
Or maybe Vincent, the night you sent him over for that tragic heart-to-heart.
They got here late, the night he went to talk to her.
She was drunk, Marty.
He took advantage.
Wow.
Your little sister's seriously hot.
Hey.
How long has it been--
Doesn't matter.
How long?
He started seeing her right after your wedding.
They met here on a regular basis.
If I'm not mistaken, he was her first.
Fuck!
Gorgeous, huh?
The people you love, they're the only ones who can hurt you.
He paid Anne... to let you seduce her, put the hook in so you'd want a share of the loft.
The first time, it was paid for.
- Have fun.
- Chris, please.
You don't know the half of it.
All right?
Just go home.
He used her, Chris.
Just like he used everyone.
Everyone.
I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch.
Vincent can't sense anything is up when he walks in.
We have to try and remain calm.
We're gonna get questioned by the cops.
That's why we can never admit we're sharing this loft.
They'll try to turn us against each other.
Okay.
I think this can work as long as we follow the plan.
Chris?
Okay.
I'm in.
But only if we know for sure that Vincent was here last night.
I wanna hear him say it.
And if he does, I'll go through with it.
I'll give a signal-- uh, break something, a glass.
But nothing happens until we know for sure.
Understood?
We've got just under two hours to set everything up and establish alibis.
I'll take care of it.
You guys get out of here.
Make sure people see you.
- Uh, you have the suicide note, right?
- I've got it.
You knew what that prick was up to... and you never said anything.
You're just as sick as Vincent.
They met here on a regular basis.
Vincent hasn't always been a good friend.
He started seeing her right after your wedding.
If I'm not mistaken, he was her first.
You are a total fucking psychopath.
I did what you told me.
I didn't tell you to fucking cut her open!
That wasn't a part of the plan.
And the Latin on the bed?
Like the cops are gonna believe that bullshit.
What happened here?
You're framing me!
Swallow it.
Swallow.
Swallow.
My own friends.
My own friends!
Am I gonna die?
No, Vincent, you're not gonna die.
Sarah lured you here and drugged you.
Then she killed herself, with you by her side.
"Fate will unite us."
But you're gonna survive.
'Cause we're friends, aren't we?
So, you see, it was a setup.
Sarah and I were set up.
The whole thing was staged.
Still sounds a little unbelievable.
Don't you think?
Unbelievable?
But it's the truth.
Yeah.
My line of work, you gotta prove the truth, and you prove it with facts and findings.
Fact is, we only found your prints and those of Sarah Deakins.
Yeah, because they wiped the place clean.
And we have the DVDs of all your sexual exploits with your prints all over them.
Luke made those DVDs.
I never even saw 'em, let alone touched 'em.
Yeah, but we got no DVDs of your friends.
No DVDs of Marty's wife.
No DVDs of Philip's sister.
No DVDs of Chris's girlfriend.
All right?
Facts and findings, Mr. Stevens.
And we got no evidence that you were being set up.
All right.
Is there anything we've forgotten?
Yeah.
To follow the fuckin' plan.
Why didn't you just handcuff her?
- She was already dead.
- That's still no reason to mutilate her.
She killed herself!
I just made it more dramatic.
Well, you better hope your dramatics don't put us in jail.
Look, just-- just lean on 'em a little bit.
Marty will break.
Maybe Luke too.
Look, don't tell me how to do my work.
We've questioned them all.
I got no reason to believe they've been lying.
Plus, all your friends have alibis.
Alibis?
Not for this morning, they don't.
We got Luke Seacord and Chris Vanowen together at breakfast.
We got Marty Landry at his office.
At his office?
Look, for at least an hour this morning, we were all in the loft.
So was Phil.
What about Phil?
He's downstairs right now with his father-in-law.
Fry?
What the fuck's Fry doing here?
He just gave a statement saying that he was with his son-in-law all day.
That is bullshit!
That is a false statement!
And why would he lie?
Hiram Fry brings a lot of credibility.
Credibili--
I saw Fry in San Diego with some bimbo!
Okay?
Phil knew that.
He knew I pressured Fry into giving me a waterfront contract.
So you tried to blackmail Hiram Fry?
Mr. Stevens, enough of this crap.
We got your prints all over the DVDs.
We got 'em all over the knife.
We got you chained next to the dead girl on the bed.
Call your lawyer, make a confession and save your ass!
You're free to go.
I want to thank you for your cooperation.
You understand we had to check out your friend's story.
Of course.
It's your job.
There's just... one thing that's bothering me.
Why does Vincent Stevens keep accusing his best friends?
I-
- I don't know.
It bothers me too.
Hmm.
Could it be-
- I just-- I just wonder--
Do you think he's trying to hide something else?
Wh-What would he be hiding?
Sarah Deakins's murder.
Murder?
But the detective in the interrogation called it a suicide.
Well, that's what it looked like.
But the autopsy report revealed that sleeping pills didn't kill her.
And her wrist was cut, but not by Sarah.
Hesitation marks, those tentative attempts-- the first ones before a suicide actually slashes through an artery--
The coroner didn't find those on her.
But Vincent, he-- he would never--
His prints are on the knife.
We didn't find a suicide note.
Is there something wrong?
We didn't find a suicide note.
You have the suicide note, right?
I've got it.
Luke.
Chris.
You scared me.
You sure it's smart meeting here?
I think we have a problem, Luke.
How so?
Where's Sarah's suicide note?
You put it in your pocket.
Yeah, I could've sworn I did, but it's not there anymore.
So when did you steal it from my coat?
When the doorbell rang this morning?
Surprise visit from the Realtor?
Chris, it's-- it's unfortunate that you lost Sarah's suicide note, but...
I had nothing to do with that.
I called the agency to ask who put our loft up for sale.
All they could give me was a number.
I did call them.
I wanted--
I thought maybe that--
It's over, Chris.
We pulled it off.
We've got nothing to worry about now.
But why'd that note disappear?
The only real proof of her suicide.
Hello?
She says she's got an appointment with someone named Sarah Deakins.
Who's Sarah Deakins?
Is it because maybe she didn't write it?
Maybe it's your handwriting.
Vincent fucked us all.
You saw.
Yeah, I saw.
All the DVDs that made everybody crazy... went right along with your grand plan, didn't it?
But why, Luke?
What'd you do to that girl?
Did she get in your way, between you and Vincent?
Actually, it was Vincent... standing between us.
Is there someone else?
I'm not cheating on you, Ellie.
Sarah, wait!
Forget Vincent.
He is better at games than you.
Always was, always will be.
He's hurting you.
Using you.
Why are you telling me this?
I'm telling you because-- because I'd never hurt you.
If you'd just give me the chance... to show I'd never hurt you.
That's right.
You'd never hurt me, because I feel nothing for you, Luke.
I'm sorry.
Maybe in another life.
You were here last night.
Barbara was off skiing.
So I figured I'd find Vincent here, with Sarah.
I'm sorry.
I waited till he left.
She said I was right about Vincent.
Consoling.
I've gotten so good at it.
I gave her an insulin OD.
It's quick, painless... leaves no trace.
Jesus, Luke.
I did it out of love.
I swear.
And Vincent taking the fall for this--
That's okay with you?
Vincent used everyone and anyone!
It's about time we turned the tables!
Well, he's being charged with murder.
Yeah.
Sarah wasn't dead when we left her with Philip.
No.
No, you're lying.
No.
That's not possible.
What Philip did to her... was sick!
You're sick, Luke.
But if I'm hearing you right, it was your brother who killed Sarah.
Okay, Chris.
Go home.
I'll clean up.
Like always.
No.
No more cleaning up, Luke.
- Step outside.
- No, Luke.
Now.
Jesus.
Let me help you, Luke.
Please!
- You're gonna kill me too?
- It's your own fault.
- What do you want me to do?
Jump?
- Yes.
If you don't mind.
Luke, you don't need to do this.
Jesus Christ, Luke!
Would you stop it!
I don't want to hurt you, Chris.
I really don't.
So just do it.
Now!
I called the cops before I came.
I told 'em everything.
Bullshit.
I know you better.
I thought I knew you.
What about the note?
Huh?
You want this to go down with me too?
Give me that note, Chris.
Give it to me!
It's over, Luke.
You're right.
It is over.
Tell Ellie and the kids...
I'm sorry.
Would you do that for me, Chris?
- No.
- Come on, Chris.
- Be a friend.
- Luke?
Luke.
Luke!
Luke!
♪♪
They're married.
Honey, no.
They're having an affair.
Why?
Because she's laughing at his jokes?
No.
I'm telling you, they're having an affair.
Since when are you the big expert on affairs?
Really?
Thanks for taking me back, Meems.
What was my alternative?
To leave you wailing at the front door, with snot pouring out of your nose?
Mmm.
Sorry.
Didn't mean to scare you off.
I have the kids early tomorrow, so I gotta go.
You're gonna leave me alone with my wife?
Yes.
We could at least have one more drink.
There'll be plenty more drinks.
Good night, Meems.
Good night, Chris.
Chris.
Anne.
Hi.
Hi.
You look good.
Thank you.
You too.
Listen, I still have the key.
Do you want it back?
It wouldn't work anymore.
Vincent's living there alone now.
It's the only thing his wife let him keep.
And, uh-
- And Philip?
He's awaiting trial, so...
we'll see.
And you?
Are you doing okay?
Yeah.
Most of the time.
And the rest of the time?
I heard you ditched the city councilman.
That's not all I've given up.
Uh, do you wanna grab a cup of coffee, or--
SUBTITLES BY KOUSHIK DAS
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.
BUT YOU HAVE
DON'T YOU THINK?
OK?
THE WHOLE THING WAS STAGED.
SO YOU WERE AFRAID?
THAT'S YOUR CLAIM.
YOU WERE THE VICTIM?
NOT...
NOT LIKE...
NOT LIKE WHO?
NOT LIKE HER?
JUST TALK TO THE OTHERS GUYS.
HAVE YOU TALKED TO THE OTHERS THERE?
WE'RE DOING OUR JOBS.
WHY DON'T YOU JUST DO YOURSELF A FAVOR AND CONFESS?
SAVE SOME LEGAL FEES.
COME ON.
WHY DON'T YOU TAKE US THROUGH THE EVENTS OF THIS MORNING?
MR. STEVENS.
MR. STEVENS?

WINDOWS ARE SEALED AND THE DOOR WAS LOCKED.
THE ALARM WAS TURNED OFF.
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
THE DOOR WAS LOCKED AND THE ALARM WAS TURNED OFF.
BUT THAT'D MEAN THAT...
THAT SOMEONE GOT IN...
WITH ONE OF OUR KEYS.
MR. SEACORD?
NO.
DOWN BY THE SPORTS ARENA?
VINCENT STEVENS.
VINCENT RUNS A VERY LARGE FIRM.
HE'S DONE A LOT OF BUILDINGS.
MR. SEACORD.
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN THERE?
NO.
YOU AND FOUR FRIENDS ARE SHARING THIS LOFT
WITHOUT YOUR WIVES' KNOWLEDGE.
THAT IS RIDICULOUS.
DON'T THE FIVE OF YOU BRING WOMEN UP THERE?
CATCH OF THE DAY? THE MRS. MIGHT FIND.
THAT IS PREPOSTEROUS.
BUT ONE OF YOUR FRIENDS ALREADY MADE A FULL CONFESSION.
YOU WANNA KNOW WHO?
LISTEN...
I...
YES.
MR. SEACORD?
I WALKED INTO A DOOR.
OR WERE YOU IN A FIGHT?
I SAID I WALKED INTO A DOOR.
WHERE WERE YOU THIS MORNING?
HAVING BREAKFAST.
THERE'D BE A LOT OF PEOPLE AT THE RESTAURANT TO VERIFY THAT.
THE PSYCHIATRIST?
THAT'S RIGHT.
ONE OF YOUR LOFT BUDDIES?
UH...
EITHER.
CHRIS.
SHIT!
PHILIP.
PHILIP?
YOU THINK YOUR BROTHER HAS SOMETHING TO DO THIS?
NO.
WE GOTTA CALL THE COPS.
IF WE CALL THE COPS?
THINK ABOUT OUR WIVES.
VINCENT.
WHY DO WE THINK PHILLIP IS INVOLVED?
I KNOW.
THEN MAYBE WE CAN...
WE GONNA DUMP THE BODY SOMEWHERE?
BUT I'M NOT TAKING THE FALL FOR THIS.
MARTY...
SON OF A BITCH!
HAVE YOU SEEN PHIL?
DO YOU KNOW WHERE HE IS?

IT'S JUST A KEY TO A ROOM.
YOU'RE NOT LIKE THAT.

WHY DO YOU LET HIM USE YOU LIKE THAT?
WHO SAYS HE'S USING ME?
MAYBE...
IT TURNS ME ON.

IT'S EXTREMELY FUCKING IMPORTANT.
SOMEONE GOT IN USING A KEY AND YOURS IS MISSING.
IS THAT RIGHT VINCENT?
THEN HOW DO YOU ACCOUNT FOR THE FACT THAT THE ALARM WAS SHUT OFF?
'CAUSE IT DEFINITELY HAD TO BE ONE OF US FIVE.
UNLESS...
UNLESS WHAT?
UNLESS SHE LET HIM IN.
VINCENT? WHO'S HIDING SOMETHING?
POLYAMORY.
IT'S A...
SOME SORT OF BELIEF SYSTEM ABOUT BEING ROMANTICALLY
AT THE SAME TIME.
HUH.
AND YOUR BOSS GET AWAY WITH THAT?
SO WHY SHOULD HE HAVE TO CHOOSE?
HUH.
AND HIS WIFE IS AMAZINGLY COOL WITH IT.
REALLY?
IS SHE SPECIAL NEEDS?
MAYBE OXYGEN DEPRIVED?

BARBARA.
WHAT'S IT CALLED AGAIN?
POLYANNEMARIE?
CHUBBS.
YOU CAN BARELY HANDLE ONE WOMAN.
WHAT WOULD YOU DO WITH TWO?
HMMM.
MARRY ONE.
I WOULD MAKE UP SOMETHING.
SOME SORT OF GAME THAT INVOLVES TWO LADIES AND ONE GUY.
OR SOMETHING.
COULD YOU AT LEAST FAKE SOME ENTHUSIASM?
I'M COOKING.
COULD YOU AT LEAST TRY AND MAKE IT HOME IN TIME?
OK?
WILL YOU JUST JOIN US?
I JUST HOPE THE PUDGY CLOWN DOESN'T PUKE ON THE RUG.
HE'S BEEN CHUGGING VODKA LIKE IT'S EVIAN.
DOESN'T HIS WIFE SEE THAT?
SHE WAS JUST COOL WITH IT LONG ENOUGH TO CATCH HIM IN THE ACT.
SHE HIRED A DETECTIVE.
THE WORKS.
MY POOR BOSS WENT FROM POLYAMORY TO ALIMONY.
WHAT-WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM?
UH...
HE AND HIS CONCUBINE ARE NOW CRAMPED IN A TINY ONE BEDROOM CONDO...

HONEY....

I MEAN HE DIDN'T COMPARTMENTALIZE.
DO YOU GUYS AGREE?
MARTY.
HOW WOULD YOU COMPARTMENTALIZE?
HOW?
I WOULDN'T HAVE A PLACE THAT YOU COULD GET CAUGHT.
BOY.
AM I RIGHT?
YOU'VE-YOU'VE LOST US ALL.
VINNY BOY. OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

I NEED TO PICK UP SOME MORE INSULIN.
LUKE...
IS THERE SOMETHING YOU WANNA TELL ME?
ARE YOU KEEPING SECRETS?
WHAT KIND OF SECRETS?
IS THERE SOMEONE ELSE?
BUT THE ANSWER IS NO.
LUKE.
I'M ASKING IF THERE'S SOMEONE ELSE.
AND...
I KNOW I'M NOT AS GLAMOROUS AS SOME.
BUT I'LL ALWAYS BE THERE FOR YOU...
AND THE CHILDREN.
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'D DO WITHOUT YOU.
I WANT YOU TO KNOW...
THERE'S A LOT I COULD PUT UP WITH...
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
I NEED TO GET HER OUT OF HERE.
HOW?
SHE IS SHACKLED TO THE BED!
CAN'T YOU GUYS SEE WHAT'S GOING ON?
SOMEONE IS TRYING TO FRAME US.
WHO?
WHO WANTS TO FRAME US?
I DON'T KNOW.
BUT THINK ABOUT IT.
THE BODY'S CUFFED TO THE BED.
IT'S POSSIBLE TO MOVE.
THE COPS COULD BE HERE ANY SECOND.
BUT NONE OF US KNOW WHO THIS GIRL IS.
WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW SHE GOT IN HERE.
WHO ELSE KNEW ABOUT THE ARRANGEMENT?
WHO ELSE KNOWS ABOUT OUR ARRANGEMENT?
DID ANYONE BLAB?
TELL ONE OF THE GIRLS THAT HAVE BEEN UP HERE?
MARTY?
WHAT?
WHY ME?
VINCENT.
WHILE SOMEONE WAS WATCHING?
ABSOLUTELY NOT.
I JUST TOLD YOU.
VINCENT?
WHERE ARE YOU GOING WITH THIS?
SOMEONE IS TRYING TO SET US UP.
LIKE WHO?
BETRAYED HUSBAND.
SOMEONE WITH A MOTIVE.
IS ONE OF YOU GUYS IN SOME KIND OF TROUBLE?
I THINK I MAY BE FALLING IN LOVE WITH YOU.
I MEAN IT.
CHRIS?
WHY WOULD YOU EVEN FEEL IT?
I'VE NEVER CHEATED ON MY WIFE BEFORE...
AND I DON'T FALL IN LOVE EASILY.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO LOVE ME.
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW ME.
BUT...
THEY'RE JUST MOMENTS.
PLEASE.
NOT JUST FOR THIS.
NO.
STOP IT.
I...
I DON'T WANT YOU TO LOVE ME.
I DON'T WANNA KEEP SNEAKING AROUND.
YOU'RE NOT.
I AM.
ANNE!
I'M GONNA LEAVE HER.
STOP IT.
WHY YOU DOING THIS?
THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE...
THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN HURT YOU.
ANNE.
STOP.
STOP WHAT?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.
WOULD YOU...
OK?
THAT'S THE END OF IT.
NO.
AT LEAST...
I'M A WHORE...
ALRIGHT?
WHAT?
I'M A PROSTITUTE.
I FUCK MEN FOR MONEY.
DO YOU GET IT NOW?
I WON'T BILL YOU FOR THE PAST
WOULD YOU...
CHRIS...
WOULD YOU WAIT A MINUTE?
ALRIGHT?
JUST GO HOME.
GO HOME TO YOUR WIFE AND YOUR KIDS.
MR. LANDRY?
I-I DOUBT THAT.
UM....
RIGHT?
MARTY?
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.
WHY DOES YOUR WIFE WANT A DIVORCE?
DIVORCE IS NOT THE RIGHT...
WHAT WE'RE GOING THROUGH...
A SEPARATION.
IT'S A TRIAL SEPARATION.
WHY?
WASN'T TOO HAPPY ABOUT.
YOU FUCKED AROUND ON HER?
IF YOU WANNA BE TECHNICAL.
HOW'D SHE FIND OUT?
THE WOMAN WITH WHOM I...
FUCKED AROUND?
AND SHE SHOWED UP ON OUR FRONT PORCH.
STARTED SAYING THINGS.
BECAUSE I LOVE HER VERY MUCH.
TO THE LOFT?
WHAT?
NO.
THIS HAPPENED IN SAN DIEGO.
RIGHT?
IN SAN DIEGO?
YEAH.
WHY YOU WERE THERE?
IT'S...
A COUPLE NIGHTS IN A FANCY HOTEL AND CHANCE TO GET AWAY FOR A COUPLE DAYS.
TOO.
THOSE GIRLS ARE DROOLING ALL OVER YOU.
TOO.
I DON'T TAKE A RAINCHECK ON THAT.
WHAT?
ARE YOU FUCKING CRAZY?
WHY WOULDN'T YOU INVITE THEM OVER?
IN A BARREL.
DOES BARBARA KNOW ABOUT THESE DEEP SEA EXPEDITIONS OF YOURS?
SEACORD?
YOU'VE GOT A KEY TO THE LOFT.
WHAT DO YOU DO UP THERE?
LAUNDRY?
DISHES?
OR WHAT?
I'M DANA.
FOR WHAT YOU GET.
DON'T YOU THINK?

IT'S CALLED FOLLOWING YOUR DICK AROUND.

TWO:
HOW DO I SEDUCE A PIG TO TRY MY WOOD?
MONTH AFTER MONTH!
I DO.
I DON'T!
I DO.
AND I FIND IT STRANGELY...
YOU KNOW WHAT I FIND STRANGELY COMPELLING?
GRAB ASS.
HUH!
CAN'T LEAVE YOU ALONE FOR A MINUTE?

IT'S BEEN MORE LIKE AN HOUR.
YOU'D THINK I'D HAVE BEEN SUBSIDIZED.
AREN'T YOU GOING TO INTRODUCE ME TO YOUR NEW FRIENDS?
AND THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME YOU MET HER?
UH...
THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME.
SARAH?
YEAH.
HER NAME WAS SARAH.
WHAT ELSE HAPPENED IN SAN DIEGO?
WHAT DO YOU WANNA KNOW?

SARAH.
YOU SHOULD NEVER DARE A CRAZY WOMAN.
IT'S OK.

MAYBE HE WON'T DARE.
OR MAYBE VINCENT'S NOT INTERESTED.
MAYBE VINCENT'D RATHER DO LAPS. GLANCES THAT EACH LASTED A SECOND TOO LONG.
HUH?
I DO.
AND I'LL TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE.
I'M BETTER AT IT THAN YOU.
CAN YOU FEEL ME?
MOST DEFINITELY.
MARTY?
DUDE!
KINDA BUSY HERE!
DON'T STOP!
GO!
GO!
SHIT!
IS WHAT IT IS.
YOU'RE RUNNING AWAY FROM YOUR FEELINGS.
I WANT TO SAY GOODBYE.
DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT IT'S LIKE TO REALLY LOVE SOMEONE?
I'M SORRY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
THROW IT AWAY.
IT'S EMPTY.
YOU WERE HERE YESTERDAY...
WEREN'T YOU?
GUYS...
WE GOTTA GO TO THE COPS.
WE'RE NOT GETTING ANYWHERE WITH THIS.
I THINK VINCENT HAS SOMETHING TO TELL YOU.
LET'S HEAR IT.
HELLO?
WHO IS IT?
WHO IS IT?
WHO WANTS TO COME UP.
SOMEBODY'S LISTED THE LOFT FOR SALE?
JESUS FUCKING...
LISTED THE LOFT?
SHE SAYS SHE HAS AN APPOINTMENT WITH A DEAKINS?
SARAH DEAKINS?
WHO-WHO'S SARAH DEAKINS?
WAIT...
WHO THE HELL IS TRYING TO SELL OUR LOFT?
MARTY.
WHAT?
AND SO DOES LUKE.
SARAH DEAKINS IS LYING ON THE BED.
I HAVE NEVER SEEN A SARAH DEAKINS.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.
YOU KNOW HER.
WHY DO YOU KEEP SAYING THAT?
REMEMBER?
DANA'S FRIEND.
THE LAST NIGHT I-I WAS WASTED OUT OF MY MIND.
THE WHOLE NIGHT'S A BLUR.
JESUS!
DON'T YOU?
THAT'S SARAH?
RIGHT?
I-I REMEMBER SARAH.
BUT HOW-HOW WAS I SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT'S SARAH?
WHAT THE HELL'S GOING ON?
I DID NOT.
I THINK THERE'S BEEN A MISTAKE.
WE DON'T KNOW ANYONE NAMED SARAH DEAKINS.
COME ON.
WHO IS IT?
DO WE KNOW HER?
I DON'T KNOW.
FUCK!
VINCE?
OR IS THERE MORE?
THING...
WITH HER.
I BROUGHT HER UP HERE A COUPLE OF TIMES.
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.
WILL YOU JUST FUCKING TELL ME?
WERE YOU HERE WITH HER LAST NIGHT?
WERE YOU THE ONE WHO LET HER IN?
I BROKE UP WITH HER LAST NIGHT.
WHEN I LEFT.
IT STILL DOESN'T EXPLAIN WHY SOMEONE LISTED THE LOFT!
OR JUST BROWSING?
AT LEAST HAVE THE DECENCY...
HOW CAN I DUMP YOU?
THERE'S NOTHING BETWEEN US.
THAT'S WHAT IT MEANT TO YOU?
NOTHING.
ALREADY?
WHO I AM?
WHAT I DO?
I HAVEN'T.
IT DOESN'T CHANGE HOW I FEEL ABOUT YOU.
HOW MANY WOMEN HAVE YOU TAKEN TO THAT THAT FUCK PAD YOU SHARE WITH YOUR FOUR LITTLE BUDDIES?
WHAT?
CHRIS...
SAVE IT FOR SOME GIRL WHO'LL ACTUALLY BUY YOUR BULLSHIT.
WAIT.
YOU KNOW I'M NOT LIKE THAT.
HERE.
I ONLY NEED THIS IF I'M WITH YOU.
SO YOU KEEP IT.
YOU LET ME KNOW.
CHRIS?
OH!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
SHOPPING FOR ALLISON?
I WAS JUST...
HERE WITH A COLLEAGUE.
WITH YOUR PALS?
I'M NOT SHARING A LOFT WITH ANY PALS.
WHEN THE BUILDING FIRST OPENED.
YOU DIDN'T EVEN KNOW WHERE THE BUILDING WAS.
I NEVER TOOK ANYONE UP THERE.
I THOUGHT THAT'S WHAT YOU MEANT.
DID YOU KNOW THE GIRL?
IN SAN DIEGO.
ARE YOU AWARE THAT MR. STEVENS BEGAN A RELATIONSHIP WITH HER IN SAN DIEGO?
FRANKLY.
YOU DIDN'T KNOW.
ISN'T VINCENT STEVENS YOUR BEST FRIEND?
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO HERE.
YOU'RE TRYING TO TURN US AGAINST EACH OTHER.
BUT GUESS WHAT?
I'M NOT ABOUT TO START TRASHING MY FRIEND.
THAT YOU WERE JEALOUS OF YOU BEST FRIEND?
HE'S NAILING ALL THESE BEAUTIFUL WOMEN...
I AM A MARRIED MAN.
I'M NOT INTERESTED IN NAILING WOMEN.
I'M NOT JEALOUS OF VINCENT.
JEALOUS OF THE WOMEN.
WHERE DO YOU GET OFF...
WITH AN INUENDO LIKE THAT?
MR. SEACORD?
AND HE HAS BEEN FOR YEARS.
MR. SEACORD.
YOU AND THE REST OF YOUR GANG.
ASSHOLE.
YOU LYING PIECE OF SHIT!
RIGHT?
PUT THE KNIFE DOWN.
PHILIP!
PUT THE KNIFE...
PUT THE KNIFE DOWN.
BACK OFF.
THE LOFT IS LISTED IN HER NAME.
THAT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE.
YOU MEAN!
JESUS!
GET A FUCKING GRIP!
FUCK!
WE CANNOT KEEP DOING THIS.
MARTY?
HUH?
JUST LEAVE ME HANGING?
VINCE?
VINCE?
ARE YOU IN THERE?
FOR JUST A SECOND.
MARTY!
I GOT COMPANY.
DIDN'T YOU GET MY TEXT?
MIMI'S GONE!
GONE?
GONE WHERE?
THAT DUMPY CHICK.
SHE SHOWED UP AND THEN TOLD HER EVERYTHING.
FUCK!
WAIT A MINUTE!
YOU DIDN'T TELL MIMI ABOUT THE LOFT?
VINCE.
IT'S ABOUT OF MY WIFE!
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M GONNA DO WITHOUT HER!
MARTY.
NEVER CONFESS.
WOULD YOU GO TO HER?
JUST-JUST TELL HER THAT I LOVE HER.
AND THAT DANA'S LYING.
SHE'LL BELIEVE YOU.
I WILL STRAIGHTEN THIS OUT.
COME HERE.
OK.
WHAT'S THE PLAN?
WHAT DO WE DO NOW?
WE GET HER OUT OF HERE.
IT'S TOO BAD.
IT'S OUR ONLY HOPE.
YOU HAD A RELATIONSHIP WITH HER.
NOW SHE'S SOME...
INCONVENIENT PIECE OF EVIDENCE?
COMING FROM YOU.
AND HOW DO YOU PLAN TO GET HER OFF THE BED?
CUT OFF HER HAND?
OR DO YOU HAVE THE KEY TO THOSE CUFFS?
PHIL.
MEANING WHAT?
YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHAT I MEAN!
ALRIGHT?
HELP ME!
KEEP YOUR FUCKING MOUTH SHUT.
HELP ME.
HE MADE ME...
TAKE IT EASY.
EASY!
ALRIGHT.
IT'S GONNA BE OK.
HE'S CRAZY!
GIVE ME THE KEYS.
MAN.
THE KEYS FOR THE HANDCUFFS.
MAN!
THE KEYS!
YOU WANT THE KEY?
HERE'S THE KEY.
HE MADE ME DO THINGS...
I DIDN'T WANNA DO.
SHUT UP!
SHUT UP!
EASY!
RIGHT?
HUH?
IT'S ALL ABOUT THE FUCKING MONEY!
HERE'S YOUR FUCKING MONEY!
IT'S RIGHT THERE!
JESUS CHRIST!
THE FUCK IS THE MATTER WITH YOU?
HAVE YOU LOST YOUR FUCKING MIND?
CHRIS.
YOU KNOW WHAT A WHORE IS?
SHUT UP!
YOU CAN'T RAPE A WHORE.
SHUT UP!
YOU CAN'T RAPE A WHORE!
YOU DON'T TREAT A WOMAN LIKE THAT!
YOU GOT IT?
NOT ANY WOMAN!
ALRIGHT?
!
MAN?
!
YOU'RE PUTTING US ALL AT RISK.
I WANT THE POLICE.
HE...
HE HIT ME.
SHUT UP.
MAKE THE COPS ARREST HIM!
HE RAPED ME!
SHUT UP!
OR I'M GONNA RIP YOUR GODDAMN THROAT OUT!
I'VE HAD IT WITH YOU!
YOU'RE NO BETTER THAN YOUR FATHER.
I'M WHAT?
YOU HEARD ME.
CHRIS.
THAT'S A NICE ONE.
RIGHT?
THE GREAT GUY...
WHO WANTS TO SAVE EVERYONE.
WHERE WERE YOU...
WHEN ZOE AND I...
WERE GETTING BEAT UP?
PRETENDING NOT TO HEAR.
WHERE WERE YOU?
GETTING LAID AND WASTED.
'CAUSE YOU DIDN'T GIVE A FUCK.
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT.
ALL THOSE YEARS!
WE DIDN'T EXIST FOR YOU.
I DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT!
IF YOU WOULD'VE TOLD ME.
IF YOU WOULD'VE SAID SOMETHING.
GODDAMN IT!
BOTH OF YOU!
BUT WE CAN'T GO TO THE COPS.
HE'S A DOCTOR.
I'M GONNA DRIVE YOU TO HIM.
OK?
NO.
BUT...
HE'S AN ANIMAL.
HE SHOULD BE LOCKED UP.
OK.
AND WE'RE GONNA DEAL WITH HIM.
I PROMISE YOU.
COME ON.
I'M GONNA GET YOUR CLOTHES...
I'M GONNA TAKE TO YOU THE DOCTOR.
HERE WE GO.
NO!
I'LL NEVER FORGIVE YOU FOR THIS...
NEVER!
WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM?
JESUS CHRIST!
WHY-WHY DON'T I KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS?
AND WHEN DID IT HAPPEN?
'CAUSE THAT'S THE KIND OF FRIENDS WE ARE.
ABOUT FRIENDSHIP.
SORRY.
I MEANT TO GIVE YOU THE COKEHEAD RAPIST LECTURE.
FUCK YOU.
YOU COULD SEE HOW I'D THINK YOU'D BE INVOLVED IN THIS.
I NEED TO SAY SOMETHING.
SHIT!
YOU HAD THAT COMING!
RELAX.
TAKE IT EASY.
YOU SON OF A BITCH.
YOU RECORDED...
EVERYTHING THAT WENT ON HERE?
EVERY WOMAN?
NOT EVERY.
NOT ALWAYS.
JUST...
SOMETIMES.
YOU JUST WATCH US AND BEAT OFF.
YOU SICK FUCK.
YOU'RE A SICK FUCK!
DID YOU RECORD LAST NIGHT?
WHICH IS AGAINST YOUR RULES.
AND IT WASN'T THE FIRST TIME YOU BROKE YOUR OWN RULES...
BY THE WAY.
AREN'T YOU?
HERE.
LIKE I ALWAYS DO.
HERE?
ANYTHING AT ALL.
FIND OUT THE TRUTH...
VINCENT?
TOMORROW.
BUT JUST NOT BY MYSELF.
ARE YOU SURE YOU CAN'T COME?
YOU KNOW I CAN'T COME.
I CAN'T JUST TAKE OFF LIKE THAT.
HEY.
I'LL CALL YOU EVERY DAY.
I LOVE YOU
RIGHT?
WRONG!
HAVE A BLAST.
DON'T MIND ME.
WHY SHOULD TONIGHT BE ANY DIFFERENT FROM THE PAST FEW MONTHS?
I'D RATHER NOT SPOIL TONIGHT.
I'M SURE IT MUST BE TEMPTING TO GRAB SOMETHING SHINY AND NEW.
CHRIS?
ALLISON?
FOR A LITTLE WHILE.
HE'S GONNA CALL ONCE HE GETS HIS PERMITS.
EVERYTHING'S APPROVED.
REALLY?
YEAH.
GENTLEMEN.
TONIGHT.
THANK YOU!
THIS IS VINCENT STEVENS.
HE'S THE ARCHITECT WHO
NEAR THE SPORTS ARENA.
WONDERFUL!
I LOVE THAT BUILDING.
MRS. KOTKIN.
I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.
SAN DIEGO...
CAN'T AFFORD TO BE...
EXPOSED TO THE NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES OF BAD DESIGN.
UH...
SAN DIEGO...
HOW'S THAT WATERFRONT PROJECT COMING ALONG?
UH...
WE'RE STILL WORKING IT ON.
LIKE EVERYONE ELSE.
MR. FRY.
MR. KOTKIN.
ARE YOU A GAMBLING MAN?
MR. STEVENS?
YOU LIKE TO TAKE CHANCES?
I DO.
ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M HOLDING A HANDFUL OF HEARTS.
I DON'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT. ALWAYS A PLEASURE.
BLACKJACK.
SET ASIDE ENOUGH FOR THE ALIMONY.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
THAT DOESN'T MEAN I'M STUCK AT HOME.
ONCE.
ONCE!
I WAS DRUNK OFF OF MY ASS.
I SWEAR IT DIDN'T MEAN A DAMN THING.
WHY BOTHER?
I PROMISE I'LL CHANGE.
HOW ABOUT THE ASS YOU ALREADY ARE?
WHAT IF I TOLD YOU I WANTED TO FUCK AROUND TONIGHT?
SORRY...
MAYBE I ALREADY GOT EVEN!
HUH?
MAYBE CHRIS?
HE'S CUTE.
HEART TO HEART.
YOU GOTTA TALK TO HIM.
BLACKJACK.
CHUBBS!
YOUR FIRST EVER WINNING STREAK.
DEAR HEART...
HALF OF IT IS MINE.
LET GO.
AND YOU'RE BEHIND MY BACK...
HER FATHER?
DID YOU SEE HER?
SHE LOOKS LIKE A HOOKER.
I THOUGHT YOU LIKE WHORES.
TOO.
I'M KINDA ON A ROLL.
YEAH.
I HOPE YOU WIN BIG TIME.
YOU'LL NEED IT WITH ALL THE SHIT YOU'VE BEEN PACKING UP YOUR NOSTRILS.
A TINY FRACTION OF YOUR STASH WENT MISSING?
FILE FOR DIVORCE.
LOSER.
GO PLAY SOME BLACKJACK.
COULD BE YOUR LAST BEST CHANCE OF PAYING THE RENT.
CAN I GET SOME DICE OVER HERE?
ANNE?
ANNE?
WE NEED TO TALK.
THE ARCHITECT.
HE'S PLAYING WITH FIRE.
I'D ACTUALLY RATHER TALK ABOUT ANNE.
MR. KOTKIN.
I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO STOP SEEING ANNE.
AND WHY WOULD I DO THAT?
BECAUSE I LOVE HER.
THEN WE HAVE MORE IN COMMON THAN WE THOUGHT.
I'D LIKE YOU TO STOP PAYING HER.
I WANT YOU TO LET HER GO.
IT'S TOTALLY HER CHOICE.
EXCEPT I NEVER PAID FOR HER.
THAT'S TRUE.
YOU NEVER PAID.
JOEL!
I'M GOING.
CHRIS.
IS HE SAYING SOMEONE'S PAYING YOU TO BE WITH ME?
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO CAN HURT ME.
ANNE.
TELL ME IT'S A LIE.
IT WAS PAID FOR.
THAT WAS ME.
WHO PAID?
I CAN'T.
LET'S GO.
I'M FINE HERE.
I'M ASKING YOU TO GO WITH ME.
COME ON.
I'M ASKING YOU TO STOP.
COME ON.
DID YOU NOT HEAR THE LADY?
MIND YOUR BUSINESS!
STOP IT!
HUH?
MAN.
WHAT DOES IT SAY UP HERE?
DEAF OR DICK?
HUH?
COME ON!
EXCUSE ME!
THANK YOU.
EXCUSE ME.
YOU'RE NOT MY DAD!
SOMEBODY GET THIS GUY AN AMBULANCE.
I NEVER WANNA SEE YOU AGAIN.
NOT IN MY HOME AND NOT NEAR MY DAUGHTER.
DO YOU GOT THAT?
GET HIM THE HELL OUTTA HERE.
SHALL WE?
HEY...
IT'S OK.
IT'S OK.
IT'S NOT WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.
WHAT I AM THINKING?
OK?
HER AND YOUR WIFE.
WHAT'S THE GRAND TOTAL?
I CAN'T HAVE THIS CONVERSATION HERE.
BARBARA'S STANDING RIGHT OVER THERE.
I LOVE YOU.
I'M CRAZY ABOUT YOU.
IF YOU COULD?
YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.
OK.
WE'LL TALK IT THROUGH.
IT'S NOT THAT SIMPLE.
BUT MAYBE I CAN MAKE IT SIMPLE.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
MAYBE I CAN HELP YOU MAKE THAT CHOICE.
SARAH.
SARAH.
SARAH!
SARAH!
I'M SORRY!
ARE YOU ALRIGHT?
SARAH.
YOU'LL REGRET IT.
THEY FOUND OUT.
THEY DID IT.
THEY SET US UP.
VINCENT?
THEY FOUND IT.
THEY FOUND OUT.
THEY FOUND OUT ABOUT THE LOFT.
VINCENT?
WE'RE YOUR FRIENDS.
NO.
WHY'D YOU DO IT?
THEY...
THEY FOUND OUT.
IT'S YOUR FRIENDS.
WE FOUND OUT.
WHAT'S GOING ON?
YOU STILL DON'T GET IT.
LET'S STRIP HIM.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
YOU ARE A TOTAL FUCKING PSYCHOPATH.
I DID WHAT YOU TOLD ME.
I DIDN'T TELL YOU TO FUCKING CUT HER OPEN!
IT WASN'T PART OF THE PLAN.
AND THE LATIN ON THE FABRIC!
THE COPS AREN'T GONNA BELIEVE THAT BULLSHIT.
LET'S DO THIS.
WHAT'D YOU GIVE ME?
WHAT YOU DESERVE.
YOU KILLED SARAH?
WE JUST FOUND HER.
WHAT?
BEFORE YOU ARRIVED.
JESUS CHRIST.
I THOUGHT SHE WAS SLEEPING.
VINCENT KNOWS HER?
SHE-SHE LEFT HIM THIS.
SEE YOU IN THE NEXT LIFE.
WHY DID SHE HAVE TO DO IT HERE?
WE GOTTA CALL THE COPS.
THEY-THEY INVESTIGATE SUICIDES.
THIS IS ALL GONNA COME OUT.
AND-AND LEAVE HER THERE?
JESUS!
PHILIP!
COME ON!
WE HAVE TO HELP OUT VINCE.
WHERE THE FUCK IS VINCE?
ISN'T THIS HIS PROBLEM?
AHEMMM.
UM...
BECAUSE I DIDN'T CALL HIM.
YOU DIDN'T CALL HIM?
WHY DIDN'T YOU CALL HIM?
THERE'S SOMETHING I HAVE TO SHOW YOU.
YOU'VE BEEN TAPING US?
!
YOU FUCKING PERVERT!
AND WE NEED TO WATCH THIS.
IF WE GET A NEW PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT HAPPENED UPSTAIRS...
MAYBE YOU'LL AGREE...
WE SHOULDN'T TAKE THE HIT FOR VINCENT'S FUCKUP.
VINCENT...
VINCENT HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN A GOOD FRIEND.
NO...
MAYBE I ALREADY GOT EVEN...
HEART TO HEART.
THE NIGHT HE WENT TO TALK TO HER.
MARTY.
HE TOOK ADVANTAGE.
WOW!
YOUR LITTLE SISTER IS SERIOUSLY HOT!
HOW LONG HAS...?
IT DOESN'T MATTER.
HOW LONG?
ON A REGULAR BASIS.
HE WAS HER FIRST.
FUCK!
HUH?
THE PEOPLE YOU LOVE...
THEY'RE THE ONLY ONES WHO CAN HURT YOU.
HE PAID ANNE...
TO LET YOU SEDUCE HER.
SO YOU'D WANNA SHARE THE LOFT.
IT WAS PAID FOR.
HAVE FUN.
ALRIGHT?
JUST GO HOME.
CHRIS.
JUST LIKE HE USED EVERYONE.
EVERYONE.
I'M GONNA KILL THAT SON OF A BITCH.
WHEN HE WALKS IN.
WE HAVE TO TRY AND REMAIN CALM.
WE'RE GONNA GET QUESTIONED BY THE COPS.
THAT'S WHY WE CAN NEVER ADMIT WE'RE SHARING THIS LOFT.
THEY'LL TRY TO TURN US AGAINST EACH OTHER.
OK.
I THINK THIS CAN WORK.
AS LONG WE FOLLOW THE PLAN.
CHRIS?
OK.
I'M IN.
THAT VINCENT WAS HERE LAST NIGHT.
I WANNA HEAR HIM SAY IT.
I'LL GO THROUGH WITH IT.
A GLASS...
UNTIL WE KNOW FOR SURE.
UNDERSTOOD?
WE'VE GOT JUST UNDER TWO HOURS TO SET EVERYTHING UP AND ESTABLISH ALIBIS.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF IT.
YOU GUYS GET OUTTA HERE.
MAKE SURE PEOPLE SEE YOU.
RIGHT?
I'VE GOT IT.
YOU KNEW WHAT THAT PRICK WAS UP TO.
AND YOU NEVER SAID ANYTHING.
YOU'RE JUST AS SICK AS VINCENT.
THEY MET HERE ON A REGULAR BASIS.
VINCENT HASN'T ALWAYS BEEN A GOOD FRIEND.
HE STARTED SEEING HER RIGHT AFTER YOUR WEDDING.
HE WAS HER FIRST.
YOU ARE A TOTAL FUCKING PSYCHOPATH.
I DID WHAT YOU TOLD ME.
I DIDN'T TELL YOU TO FUCKING CUT HER OPEN.
IT WASN'T PART OF THE PLAN.
AND THE LATIN ON THE FABRIC!
THE COPS AREN'T GONNA BELIEVE THAT BULLSHIT!
WHAT HAPPENED HERE?
YOU'RE FRAMING ME!
SWALLOW IT.
SWALLOW.
MY OWN FRIENDS.
MY OWN FRIENDS!
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DIE.
SARAH LURED YOU HERE AND DRUGGED YOU.
WITH YOU BY HER SIDE.
FATE WILL UNITE US.
BUT YOU'RE GONNA SURVIVE.
AREN'T WE?
YOU SEE?
IT WAS A SETUP.
SARAH AND I WERE SET UP.
THE WHOLE THING WAS STAGED.
DON'T YOU THINK?
BUT IT'S THE TRUTH.
YEAH.
AND YOU PROVE IT WITH FACTS AND FINDINGS.
WE ONLY FOUND YOUR PRINTS AND THOSE OF SARAH DEAKINS.
BECAUSE THEY WIPED THE PLACE CLEAN.
WITH YOUR PRINTS ALL OVER THEM.
TOUCHED 'EM.
BUT WE'VE GOT NO DVDS OF YOUR FRIENDS.
NO DVDS OF MARTY'S WIFE.
NO DVDS OF PHILIP'S SISTER.
MR. STEVENS.
AND WE GOT NO EVIDENCE THAT YOU WERE BEING SET UP.
ALRIGHT.
IS THERE ANYTHING WE'VE FORGOTTEN?
TO FOLLOW THE FUCKING PLAN.
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST HANDCUFF HER?
SHE WAS ALREADY DEAD.
STILL NO REASON TO MUTILATE HER.
SHE KILLED HERSELF.
I JUST MADE IT MORE DRAMATIC.
YOU BETTER HOPE YOUR DRAMATICS DON'T PUT US IN JAIL.
TOO.
ALRIGHT?
WE QUESTIONED THEM ALL.
I GOT NO REASON TO BELIEVE THEY'VE BEEN LYING.
THEY DON'T.
AT BREAKFAST.
ALRIGHT?
WE WERE ALL IN THE LOFT.
SO WAS PHIL.
WHAT ABOUT PHIL?
WITH HIS FATHER-IN-LAW.
FRY?
WHAT THE FUCK'S FRY DOING HERE?
ALL DAY.
THAT IS BULLSHIT!
THAT IS A FALSE STATEMENT!
AND WHY WOULD HE LIE?
HIRAM FRY BRINGS A LOT OF CREDIBILITY.
OK?
PHIL KNEW THAT.
HE KNEW I PRESSURED FRY INTO GIVING ME A WATERFRONT CONTRACT.
SO YOU TRIED TO BLACKMAIL HIRAM FRY?
ENOUGH OF THIS CRAP.
WE GOT 'EM ALL OVER THE KNIFE.
ALRIGHT?
CALL YOUR LAWYER.
MAKE A CONFESSION AND SAVE YOUR ASS.
YOU'RE FREE TO GO.
I WANNA THANK YOU FOR YOUR COOPERATION.
WE HAD TO CHECK OUT YOUR FRIEND'S STORY.
THAT'S YOUR JOB.
THERE'S JUST...
ONE THING THAT'S BOTHERING ME.
WHY DOES VINCENT STEVENS KEEP ACCUSING HIS BEST FRIENDS?
TOO.
COULD IT BE...
I JUST...
I JUST WONDER...
YOU THINK HE'S TRYING TO HIDE SOMETHING ELSE?
WHAT WOULD HE HIDING?
SARAH DEAKINS' MURDER.
MURDER?
CALLED IT A SUICIDE.
THAT'S WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE.
BUT THE AUTOPSY
REPORT REVEALED THAT SLEEPING PILLS DIDN'T KILL HER.
BUT NOT BY SARAH. BEFORE A SUICIDE ACTUALLY SLASHES THROUGH AN ARTERY.
THE CORONER DIDN'T FIND THOSE ON HER.
UH...
HE WOULD NEVER...
HIS PRINTS ARE ON THE KNIFE.
WE DIDN'T FIND A SUICIDE NOTE.
IS THERE SOMETHING WRONG?
WE DIDN'T FIND A SUICIDE NOTE.
RIGHT?
I'VE GOT IT...
LUKE.
CHRIS!
YOU SCARED ME.
YOU SURE IT'S SMART...
MEETING HERE?
LUKE.
HOW SO?
WHERE IS SARAH'S SUICIDE NOTE?
YOU PUT IT IN YOUR POCKET.
I DID.
BUT IT'S NOT THERE ANY MORE.
WHEN DID YOU STEAL IT FROM MY COAT?
WHEN THE DOORBELL RANG THIS MORNING?
FROM THE REALTOR?
BUT...
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT.
I CALLED THE AGENCY TO ASK WHO PUT OUR LOFT UP FOR SALE.
ALL THEY COULD GIVE ME WAS A NUMBER.
I DID CALL THEM.
I WANTED TO...
MAYBE THAT...
NOW.
WHY'D THAT NOTE DISAPPEAR?
THE ONLY REAL PROOF OF HER SUICIDE?
HELLO?
SAYS SHE'S GOT AN APPOINTMENT WITH SOMEONE NAMED SARAH DEAKINS?
WHO'S SARAH DEAKINS?
IS IT BECAUSE MAYBE SHE DIDN'T WRITE IT?
MAYBE IT'S YOUR HANDWRITING?
VINCENT FUCKED US ALL.
YOU SAW.
I SAW.
ALL THE DVDS THAT MADE EVERYBODY CRAZY.
DIDN'T IT?
LUKE?
WHAT DID YOU DO TO THAT GIRL?
DID SHE GET IN YOUR WAY?
BETWEEN YOU AND VINCENT?
IT WAS VINCENT...
STANDING BETWEEN US.
IS THERE SOMEONE ELSE?
MUCH...
SARAH!
WAIT.
FORGET VINCENT.
HE'S BETTER AT GAMES THAN YOU.
ALWAYS WILL BE.
HE'S HURTING YOU.
USING YOU.
WHY ARE YOU TELLING ME THIS?
I'M TELLING YOU BECAUSE...
BECAUSE I'D NEVER HURT YOU.
JUST GIVE ME THE CHANCE...
TO SHOW I'D NEVER HURT YOU.
LUKE.
I'M SORRY.
MAYBE IN ANOTHER LIFE.
YOU WERE HERE LAST NIGHT?
BARBARA WAS OFF SKIING.
SO I FIGURED I'D FIND VINCENT HERE...
WITH SARAH.
I'M SORRY.
I WAITED 'TIL HE LEFT.
SHE SAID I WAS RIGHT ABOUT VINCENT.
CONSOLING...
I'VE GOTTEN SO GOOD AT IT.
PAINLESS.
LEAVES NO TRACE.
LUKE.
I DID IT OUT OF LOVE...
I SWEAR.
AND VINCENT TAKING THE FALL FOR THIS.
IT'S OK WITH YOU?
VINCENT USED EVERYONE AND ANYONE!
IT'S ABOUT TIME WE TURNED THE TABLES!
HE'S BEING CHARGED WITH MURDER.
WHEN YOU LEFT HER WITH PHILIP.
YOU'RE LYING.
NO.
THAT'S NOT POSSIBLE.
WHAT PHILIP DID TO HER...
WAS SICK.
LUKE.
BUT...
IF I'M HEARING YOU RIGHT...
IT WAS YOUR BROTHER...
WHO KILLED SARAH.
CHRIS.
GO HOME.
I'LL CLEAN UP.
LIKE ALWAYS.
NO.
LUKE.
STEP OUTSIDE.
LUKE.
NOW.
PLEASE!
TOO?
IT'S YOUR OWN FAULT.
IF YOU DON'T MIND!
LUKE.
WILL YOU STOP IT?
CHRIS.
I REALLY DON'T.
SO JUST DO IT.
NEVER!
BEFORE I CAME.
I TOLD THEM EVERYTHING.
BULLSHIT!
I KNOW YOU HAVEN'T.
I THOUGHT I KNEW YOU.
TOO?
CHRIS.
GIVE IT TO ME!
LUKE.
YOU'RE RIGHT.
IT IS OVER.
TELL ALLIE AND THE KIDS...
I'M SORRY.
CHRIS?
CHRIS.
BE A FRIEND.
LUKE!
LUKE!
LUKE!
LUKE!
LUKE!
NO.
THEY'RE HAVING AN AFFAIR.
I'M TELLING YOU THEY'RE HAVING AN AFFAIR.
SINCE WHEN ARE YOU THE BIG EXPERT ON AFFAIRS?
REALLY?
MEEMS.
WHAT WAS MY ALTERNATIVE?
TO LEAVE YOU WAILING AT
WITH SNOT POURING OUT OF YOUR NOSE?
DIDN'T MEAN TO SCARE YOU OFF.
SO I GOTTA GO.
ALONE?
WITH MY WIFE? WE CAN AT LEAST HAVE ONE MORE DRINK.
THERE'LL BE PLENTY MORE DRINKS.
CHRIS.
CHRIS!
ANNE?
HI.
HI.
TOO.
I STILL HAVE THE KEY.
DO YOU WANT IT BACK?
IT WON'T WORK ANYMORE.
NOW.
IT'S THE ONLY THING HIS WIFE LET HIM KEEP.
UH...
AND PHILIP?
HE'S AWAITING TRIAL.
WE'LL SEE.
AND YOU?
YOU DOING OK?
YEAH.
MOST OF THE TIME.
AND THE REST OF THE TIME?
I HEARD YOU DITCHED THE CITY COUNCILMAN?
THAT'S NOT ALL I'VE GIVEN UP.
OR...?

BRADLEY WIGGINS:
A lot ofcycling is about climbing mountains.
And he personified how it should look in this floating, angelic sense that it was effortless for him.

Armstrong now is actually a little in difficulty, I would say, Phil.
Marco Pantani.
But look at that, so is Jan Ullrich, looking down for gears and looking down for help.

COMMENTATOR:
Marco Pantani dopo 33 anni rivince il Tour de France.
Pantani won the 1 998 Giro and the Tour and he was a dynamic rider.
He was one of the riders that was so strong, that could make up the deficit in the climbs that he lost in the time trials.
SHERWEN:
He has learned how to suffer again.
Look at the face on Marco Pantani.
(CHEERING)
WIGGINS:
I got to race with him.
I remember being in awe of this guy.
I think he was the people's champion and he would ride past with these 50, 60 people chasing him, like this god that people worshipped.
LIGGETT:
Look at this crowd now, because they love him so much.
I almost felt... not worthy to be in his company.

There is something magical about the Tour.
IT's like The Wizard Of Oz when you go into the fairy tale, where everything's exaggerated - the flowers, the colours.
MATT RENDELL:
Three weeks, thousands of miles and the yellowjersey at the end of it.
WIGGINS:
It's the only sporting event in the world where it's long enough that you'd probably need a haircut halfway through.
EVGENI BERZIN:
LE MOND:
That's why you'll see teams working together, because everybody's escorting the top riders, delivering them to the bottom of the climb.
"OK, go.
Do the battle, do the battle."
RICHARD WILLIAMS:
There's no doubt that the mountains give those stage races their drama.
RENDELL:
In the mountains you have the very obvious, visible opposition between man and nature.
The sheer unnaturalness of riding a bike uphill...
It's Sisyphean.
WIGGINS:
You want to stop all the time.
You're unable to.
You have to push on.
LE MOND:
And so it's where the pure, raw talent gets to come out and gets to separate itself from the rest of the riders.
WILLIAMS:
Mountains were what gave the race its flavour because you could see these men suffering.

RENDELL:
In the early 1990s, cycling became...
less mystical.
Calculation began to take the place of inspiration in cycling.
Self-evidently, you could see aerodynamic helmets, bodysuits.
Low, wind-tested positions.
It was scientific.
Miguel Indurain, for the previous two years, had won the great races - the Giro d'Italia and the Tour de France.
- (CHEERING) - (APPLAUSE)
A colossus of a man.
The prototype of the world-beating cyclist.
WILLIAMS:
He was formidable in any stage.
A guy who can ride at high tempo all day, in a relentless way, to grind the opposition to dust.
RENDELL:
Incredibly fast in the time trials, he could hold on in the mountains.
Indurain was widely regarded as utterly invincible.
The Giro d'Italia, almost as tough as the Tour de France.
Indurain was going for his third consecutive Giro/Tour double.
It was unheard of.

ITALIAN COMMENTATOR:

WILLIAMS:
Indurain was probably pushing 80 kilos and six foot two.
Pantani was five foot eight and weighed 50 kilos.
It's like a heavyweight and a flyweight.
That's one of the great things about cycling, is that you can have a heavyweight and a flyweight in the same ring together.
RENDELL:
Indurain was scientific.
Pantani rode from pure instinct.
His descending was stunning.
WILLIAMS:
He'd just hook his rear end over the saddle, to become as aerodynamic as possible.
RENDELL:
We're talking 80, 90, 1 00 kilometres an hour.
WIGGINS:
And all of a sudden it was Pantani, a man who looked the age of 40, cos he was bald and slightly frail, but actually was only 24.
RENDELL:
Televisions came on all over Italy, France, Spain.
He seemed to catch the imagination in a way that no other cyclist had ever done.
He beat Indurain into third place.
Immediately, a star was born.
RENDELL:
It had taken years for Indurain to start making the podiums.
Pantani did it almost instantly.
He restored a sense of the magic to the sport that had been forgotten.
It was like going back 50 years.

There is only one thing that drives somebody to get to professional.
It's passion.
They have to love it.
I would call it an addiction. (LAUGHS)
RENDELL:
There's something about cycling.
It's a sport for loners.
You spend a long, long time pre-season doing base miles, emaciating your physique into the shape it has to be in to be competitive.
LE MOND:
But something changes when you turn professional.
All of a sudden, there's real pressure on you.
You're no longer doing this for this passion, you're getting paid and they expect you to perform.
WILLIAMS:
The thing about a stage race is that it's notjust one race, it's lots of different races.
To win the yellowjersey for the overall victory, that's the best thing.
But stage wins are really, really important.
The Alpe d'Huez, it's a single climb, 1 3.8 kilometres, with 2 1 hairpin bends.
WILLIAMS:
It's steep, an average of 8% gradient.
WILLIAMS:
It's actually like a bullring.

SAVINI:

The parting of the waters for Marco Pantani.
What a marvellous moment for him.
RENDELL:
On the climbs, the physical demands are immense.
It's the same competitive challenge kids in swimming pools do - holding their breath - who's going to give up first?
Who's going to asphyxiate themselves longest, until you're almost at the point of blacking out?
And that's what climbing up a hill is like, and that's what Pantani could do more than anyone else - descend into the darkness, hold it there and then come out alive.

This beautiful man who attacked at the bottom of the climb and used such pure speed that's only given to the gifted climbers of this world.
COMMENTATOR:
Marco Pantani può alzare il braccio.

WILLIAMS:
To be a stage winner in the Tour de France is something very special.
You've established yourself.
WILLIAMS:
Cycling's a very dangerous sport.
A moment's lack of concentration can bring you down, and maybe 20 or 30 other riders.
It's bad enough on the flat, but if they're coming down a hill at high speed then that's seriously dangerous.
LIGGETT:
The crash on the descent of the Pyrenean mountain, it involved six riders.

This brilliant little climber who almost lost his life in a serious accident in a race nearly two years ago.
They said he would never walk or ride a bike again.
He's now come back, two years on, to Alpe d'Huez and he's destroying the field here.

But almost before the race began it looked like Pantani's dream would become impossible.
As the Tour de France is getting under way, news filters through that a team car belonging to the Festina team has been stopped at the border between Belgium and France and a huge scandal begins to build up.

Well, it's 2.1 8, which was to have been Neil Stephens' start time today but, as you can see, there's no sign of him in the start house and, apart from the continuing presence of their logos everywhere,
it looks, after all the machinations of this morning, as though Festina's involvement in this year's Tour is finally over.
Nous reviendrons I'année prochaine.
(TRANSLATION FROM FRENCH)
WILLIAMS:
Cycling's attracted a lot of criticism because of its attitude to drugs.
The very earliest Tours de France were terribly gruelling.
Riders soon started to find ways of numbing the pain, whether it was brandy or strychnine or heroin or mixtures of any and all of those.
Jacques Anquetil, who won the race five times, in the years after the war, once said,
"You can't win the Tour de France on mineral water,"
and everybody knew what he meant.
(THEY SING IN ITALIAN)

But it wasn't really until Tom Simpson, the British cyclist, died on the Mont Blanc Tour in 1 967 that people really woke up to the fact that maybe we ought to be starting to make these things illegal.

The biggest scandal in sporting history.
Most say they're innocent, but the admission by one team that they, at least, have been on a systematic drugs programme for two years has rocked the sport.

ROBERTO PREGNOLATO:
ITALIAN REPORTER:
WILLIAMS:
The Festina affair, which stopped the '98 Tour dead in its tracks, was really the culmination of investigations into EPO.
EPO controls the production of red blood cells.
A large number of red blood cells are a good thing for endurance athletes cos it gives their muscles better access to oxygen.
RENDELL:
You have powers you simply did not have before.
If you have a 200km stage, a 1 % improvement is a 2km advantage.
Artificial EPO appeared in about 1 990, so its use was very widespread.
But when young, otherwise very fit cyclists in Holland and Belgium started dying in their sleep, it became apparent it was overused.
A concentration of red blood cells would make the blood silt up.
Riders started wearing their heart-rate monitors at night, so that when the heart rate dropped the alarm would go off.
And they would have bikes on rollers, where they could raise their heart rate.
So, they'd race all day and then they'd ride during the night as well, simply to stay alive.
For the 1 999 season, a test is introduced.
It's not a doping test as such, because there is no way of detecting directly EPO in the blood.
Instead, they introduce a health test.
If your haematocrit, your red blood cell count, is above 50% you're suspended for two weeks.
In '98, he's won the great double.
In '99, Pantani wants to enter legend.
He wants to rival the great Fausto Coppi, who would win stages by 1 0, 1 5, 20 minutes.
VELO:
RENDELL:
His team-mates rode like an Olympic sprint on the track.
Each man leading out the others and then peeling off.
Sprinting uphill.
40km an hour.
It wasn'tjust a masterclass.
It was a humiliation of his rivals.
All Italy is exulted.
But there are other interests at stake who aren't so happy.
PREGNOLATO:
RENDELL:
If you think of a cycling peloton, you've got 1 80 riders.
There has to be give and take.
(TRANSLATION FROM ITALIAN)
Televised cycling is about advertising.
Large companies are putting millions of euros into these teams to get their logos on television screens around the world.
(TRANSLATION FROM SPANISH)
Pantani's total dominance is bad for the financial structures that keep the sport healthy.
(INSECTS BUZZ)
His team have ordered him not to win the next stage, but somehow he can't hold himself back.
Pantani comes soaring past, and Buenahora, who's one of the best climbers in the world, gets on his wheel, holds it there.
But within 1 00, 200 metres he's being asphyxiated by the speed of Pantani and he simply has to drop off, because if he doesn't, he's not even going to finish the stage.
And there is no doubt that this is going to be one of the great victories in Giro history.

It wasn't a doped rider here, a doped rider there.

Given an entirely clean sport during his era,
Pantani would almost certainly still have excelled.
WIGGINS:
I don't think any of us can imagine what it would have been like then, all the pressures he'd have been under.
If you were going to survive, and if you wanted to win, or be a professional and make a living, you had to do what you were told to do.
RENDELL:
I don't think you can separate a man from the decisions that he takes.
But decisions aren't taken in isolation.
Pantani turned professional and joined a team, Carrera, and finds himself in the company of doctors funded notjust by the state but by the great sporting institutions.
And all this is available forhim andhe is the hope of Italian cycling.
It creates pressures that I don't think any of us could resist.
The doctors, the directeurs sportifs, the general managers of the teams, the sponsors, the beneficiaries of doped sport they carry on earning good money, they carry on with their prestige.
And the athletes are the instruments of the system.
Pantani was an instrument of the sporting system.
It brought him fantastic success, but ultimately led to his complete destruction.

Tired of all those fliers on your door?"
Oh, my God!
I was just saying that!
Then we wouldn't have to put up with this trash anymore.
10% off my next treat at tcby?
!
Wait a minute.
Are these all amazing?
"Missing child."
I don't see how that's a deal.
What am I doing wrong?
That blonde outside of Walgreens was getting signatures.
Come on, hayley.
Everyone knows blondes get more attention.
Scientists have proven it.
But their research was ignored because they were boring, brown-haired scientists.
From the gentlemen at the bar.
Looks like brunettes get attention, too.
That's not yours!
That is not for you!
Come on!
Be serious!
It's for the blonde!
Thanks!
Uh, she'll be fine.
Don't worry about her.
We're not!
Rosalie's pizza?
I have a very important question.
Do you deliver to hillside acres?
Yes!
Good, good.
My next question, which is so important that it should have been my first and only question -- do you accept half-burnt coupons?
He's checking.
He's checking!
Whoo-Hoo!
Maybe!
Dad, these houses aren't done yet.
Besides, the gate's locked.
That is a beautiful gate!
And imagine how many fliers this thing can hold!
Wait, I thought we're moving to get away from the fliers?
Oh, lord, no.
Keep up, Steve.
We're moving here to keep the riffraff out.
The fact that we'll be tripling our flier intake is just a huge, huge, huge, huge...
What were we talking about?
About why on earth we would leave our perfectly good house where our family has so many memories to come here.
It's the goddamn riffraff!
But this gate will keep them out!
I mean, were they to try to get in, they would have to kneel down, raise their partner's foot, and hoist them over...
Aah!
Oof!
And who's to say how his accomplice would get in?
Oh, look!
A private mini zoo just for the residents.
Dad, those are guard dogs.
Well, they should all be fired, 'cause we got in here pretty easily, especially me.
Steve, there's our dream house.
Where?
You see the one that's bathed in that ray of sunlight?
It's the one right next to it.
Yeah, that's the one.
# I'm gonna go hear some jazz at pips # # and see some gorgeous half-black girls # you want to go, Francine?
Roger, did we bring all the bags in?
I can't find my hair dye.
Francine?
!
But if you're there, then I must have been talking to Dolly parton?
!
Oh, my God!
Dolly, it's such an honor to have you in our house!
I've seen "smoky Mountain Christmas"
like 400 times!
Turn, Dolly!
Spin and point your face at me as soon as you feel comfortable!
"Nine to five," alive!
It's hayley!
ThisI canworkwith.
I hope you're up for some fun, blondie.
Thanks, but I didn't dye my hair to have fun, okay?
I did it so that people would pay more attention to what I have to say.
Oh, yeah, of course.
That's what I meant.
And I know where you can make the most difference -- celebrity charity events.
Roger, come on.
I always thought those events were just publicity stunts.
Oh, no way.
The bigger the dollars, the bigger the change.
That's why tonight, we're going to a benefit at dush.
I don't know.
I even have the perfect guide.
Jojo quinoa!
And just like the superfood, I'm for sale at trader Joe's.
Behind trader Joe's.
For free.
We can put a pool table over here.
Oh, and this is a perfect spot for a breakfast nook.
Steve, come pretend we're having cereal!
Is something wrong, son?
No, dad, nothing's wrong.
It's clear you're not feeling the house, Steve.
Well, what do you want me to do, huh?
Pretend I like it when I really don't want to move in the first place?
!
Pssh!
Damn it, son!
Don't you get it?
!
Change is good!
Come on!
Follow me!
Son, this is your room.
Go on -- take a look out that door there.
Tell me what you see.
It's a sun deck.
A-and there's a jacuzzi!
Just imagine all the killer parties you're gonna have up here.
This is the house, Steve.
This is where your life finally comes together.
My life's okay.
It sucks.
But think about what it could be.
I like video games.
I like scaredy boys.
Uh...
You and I clearly have stuff we need to work out.
I'm beginning to get the picture, papa.
This party is amazing.
There must be so much money being raised.
Cocaine is so much more fun when it's for a good cause.
Hey, speaking of causes, have you ever heard of garbage island?
I can't wait to hear all about it.
Let me go grab us a couple of drinks so we don't get dry mouth when we talk about garbage for hours.
I think they're serving owl here.
Or maybe that was a display.
Either way, I ate an owl.
Sounds like we're both knockin' it out of the park!
Man, this blonde hair is working.
Everybody's listening to me about garbage island.
I told you!
Hayley, I just found out about a charity gala poppin' off in Vegas!
I guess it's for one of the hottest new causes out there.
How are we gonna get to Vegas?
Easy!
We'll take my private jet!
Private jet?
I-isn't that the most wasteful way to travel?
Got to burn money to raise money!
Hayley, the earth is dying.
We don't have time to ride a bus.
Well...
I guess it's for a good cause.
Let's do it.
You want to know what's crazy?
This is not the owl I ate earlier.
See, Steve, when you live on a hill, you can look down on everyone.
It's not the only reason to live on a hill, but it's the main one.
Yeah, I'm starting to warm up to the idea of living in a gated community.
Mind if I turn on the jets?
Bub-bub-bub-bub-bub-bub, bub-bub-bub-bub-bub-bub, bub-bub-bub-bub-bub-bub.
Looks like the security patrol is doing the rounds.
Terrible for us now, but great for when we live here.
All right, boys.
You're on your own tonight.
I'm taking an html class at the learning annex.
They say the future of groundskeeping is all online.
Dad?
Did you close the front door?
Ohh!
I don't think I'm gonna follow Billy ocean on instagram anymore.
He never leaves the bathroom.
Oh, hayley and Roger are tearing it up in Vegas.
What?
!
Hayley, where are you?
I'm at a charity event in Vegas.
It's my fifth one tonight!
We're on a charity crawl!
Whoo!
Honey, I'm worried you're losing sight of --
I got to go.
Someone's about to donate all over my stomach.
Whoa.
You're, like, super-hot at charity.
Thank you.
You need to come with me to dj iron monkey's yacht for the biggest charity event of the decade.
So, we're not counting the Jerry Lewis telethon in 2008 when Richard Chamberlain just showed up to sing three songs and half the audience had heart attacks?
Actually, Richard Chamberlain will be there.
As you'll see, this whole yacht runs on solar power.
Dude, that shit's tight.
I know.
Also, if you're wondering why all the ladies are topless, we banned all clothes made in Chinese sweatshops.
Well, if them's the rules.
These were made in Canada, but don't tell anybody.
So, did you find any chicks for the party?
Yeah, some blonde from Virginia.
She's buying into all that charity crap.
So if you want to get with her, just ask her about her causes.
Cool.
Thanks again for doing this, man.
This probably isn't what you went to college for, so I really appreciate it.
No, no.
It's cool.
It's cool.
I majored in art history, but part of going to college is figuring out what you don't want to do.
Charity.
This feels amazing!
We should raise money for ecstasy!
We're saving the world, girl!
I just wish we had gum!
Do you have any gum?
Gum?
I'd love some gum!
Let's talk about this forever!
I can't believe I'm in iron monkey's head.
Iron monkey can't believe you are, either.
Iron monkey can't believe a lot of things.
It's so great that you're doing this for charity.
Uh, but what's the cause we're raising money for again?
The environment.
No one even realizes how important the environment is.
I mean, where would we be without it?
Space?
No, thanks.
I'm too scared of black holes to live there.
Oh, me too.
Me too, iron monkey.
How about I show you around the ship, so you can see all the ways this mega yacht protects this...
Environment?
Charity.
Dad, these dogs are relentless!
When are they gonna give up?
!
Hang in there, son.
Those losers aren't getting in.
Yeah, I called you losers!
Do...
Do you think they went away?
Yeah.
I called them losers.
You don't come back from that.
They're on the roof!
Steve, you didn't by any chance secure the fireplace, did --
I don't think this bit gets any funnier, Steve!
Run!
Aah!
To the sun deck!
Oh, my God!
Dad, are you okay?
!
I'm sorry, Steve.
You've been in my study.
Have you seen a medical-school degree on the wall?
I don't know!
Sorry for being condescending.
Maybe it's the first sign of rabies.
But then again, I'm not a doctor, so I don't know!
Sorry.
That's the rabies talking.
Maybe.
Do you like the table?
It's one solid, 800-pound piece of cork.
The ship builder really didn't want me to put this in the hull.
But that just made me want it more.
Aren't cork trees endangered?
That's why it's so important to cut them down now.
Does that make sense?
Shh.
Drink your wine.
Yello?
Yo, monkey, I got another girl lined up.
She's into threesomes, but I may get her to agree to a twosome.
I got to take this.
Oh, my God!
Whales!
Oh, my God...
Slave whales!
This yacht's not solar-powered.
It's -- it's whale-powered!
Iron monkey's a phony!
What a fake!
He's not changing anything.
He's just partying.
That's all anyone's doing here.
Including you.
You dyed your hair so people would listen to you.
But then you just got super-drunk, and you totally forgot to talk about your stuff.
I came here to make a difference, and I am going to make one.
Starting by freeing those whales.
He threw these out without cutting them?
!
Is there no level to which he won't stoop?
!
Wait.
What?
Mom?
!
Well, this ain't your daddy.
What are you doing here?
And why are you dressed like me?
I came because I knew you'd lost your way.
I'm here to remind you of who you are!
That's really sweet, mom.
But I already figured it out for myself.
Two minutes ago.
Really?
I made my hair ugly, took an 11-hour flight, then paid a mallorcan fisherman a thousand mallorcan money units to row me out here all for nothing?
!
No, it wasn't.
I need your help to do something truly good.
They're gonna get through!
Just one nail left.
Better make it count.
Goodbye, son.
Dad, wait!
Shoot that propane tank!
Maybe the explosion will scare off the dogs!
Good thinking!
You did it!
Uh-oh, Steve.
It must be connected to the main gas line.
This whole place is gonna blow!
What are you doing?
Get on.
Now hold on tight.
It worked!
Dad, even though we're not moving into that cool house,
I'll still get to have parties with girls, right?
Afraid not, Steve.
And we should really talk about what snot was doing in your fantasy.
Oh, no!
They're gaining on us!
Hang on tight!
Wait.
The mailboxes are down here by the guard gate?
You have to come all the way down here to get your mail?
Oh, screw this place.
I think the whales are to the right up here.
Do you mean starboard?
We're on a boat, hayley.
Start talking boat.
Yeah!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
You guys aren't allowed down here.
Oh...
Um...
Sorry.
Uh, we were just...
Looking for the dance floor.
I'lltakeyou.
It's on the next deck.
No.
I think it's right here.
What?
That's right, lady.
I'm challenging you to a dance-off.
Unless you don't think you've got the moves.
Oh, I've got moves all day till Sunday.
Go free the whales.
We talked about this, Roger.
You're the one who frees the whales every time.
This was gonna be the time you did the dance-off, but here we are, in the whale room, once again.
Aww, damn!
Here comes the rebuttal!
Youteachpeople how to treat you!
That was a'ight.
But let me show you how it's done.
Make some room.
Make some room!
Whales are free.
It's over.
We did it!
All he has to do is get more whales, and he'll be back at it.
Trust me.
This ocean is lousy with whales.
Now, let's end this once and for all.
Did you kill this guy?
That's it -- next time, I'm doing the dance-off!
It won't budge!
Let's give up.
We need to find something to help us pry it out.
Maybe there's something in here.
Tusks.
I think we can no longer deny the facts.
This guy is an elephant dentist.
For the first time in my life,
I feel like I really did something to help the earth.
Ugh!
Hayley, the oil spill dyed your hair back to normal.
Everything worked out!
Oh, look.
My cigarettes stayed dry.

LA CUCARACHA PLAYS ON ELECTRIC ORGAN
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE
Anyway, in this L series, we have a special bonus, which is if there's a lavatorial question, it's a Spend A Penny.
- There you go.
- JAUNTY JINGLE, FLUSHING
Because L is for lavatory, there may be a question which involves something lavatorial.
If you think you've spotted the question, wave your penny.
So, let's have a look at question one.
What was the problem with the first ever contact lenses?
- ORGAN MUSIC PLAYS
- Jo Brand?
Were they made of hydrochloric acid?
- LAUGHTER
- That would have been - a serious problem.
I presume they were massive and heavy and awkward and difficult?
They were very awkward, massive and difficult.
I'll give you 20 years either way to say what year they first appeared.
- ALAN AND JOSH: 1920.
- Oh, that's weird.
Whoa!
- Scary.
- That was odd!
No, it's not that. 1880, actually.
It was in Germany, where they grind lenses extremely well.
And there was one pioneer called August Muller, who could only wear them for half an hour, and then only after he had used cocaine on his eyes to numb them cos they were very, very painful.
- Best excuse ever!
- Yeah.
"Oh, my eyes, they're so..."
- "Mein augen!" Yeah. - "Ooooh...."
LAUGHTER
"Oh, my eyesight is so irritable and keen!"
"My eyes are talking nonsense!"
They used to saw off the bottom of test tubes and then grind them smooth and put them in.
They were used not for vision correction.
Originally, they were concealing eye damage and things like that, to protect sensitive eyes.
And then...
Was the eye damage caused by the contact lenses?
Well, you'd think!
But then they got more sophisticated with it.
By the 1920s and '30s in America they were quite popular, but only with incredibly rich people.
- That's quite a big one, there.
- That is big.
LAUGHTER
In the '20s and '30s they cost more than a car, one set.
So, it was only very rich daddies who would let...
Because their daughters didn't want to wear glasses.
And if you watch Hollywood movies of the '30s and '40s, you will see that no actress wears glasses, except an actress who is playing a part that is basically a librarian, a dowd, a frump...
I'm not looking at you when I'm saying that!
LAUGHTER
APPLAUSE
IN AMERICAN ACCENT: "Why, Miss Quimby, you're beautiful!"
Anyway, we have borrowed some objects from the world-famous British Optical Association Museum.
And you each have, and I'm going to start with Phill, you have an optical object and I'd like you to tell me what you think it might be.
Oh.
Right.
- Well, it's got a lovely leather surround.
- Yes.
- Right, so why would you want to see things this red?
- Yeah.
Was it for nascent superhero Communist Man?
LAUGHTER
Are they literally rose-tinted glasses?
Are you feeling...?
"Ah, the '80s!
The Style Council!"
LAUGHTER
"The Guardian with a decent header font.
Oh!"
LAUGHTER
"Araucaria, his crosswords were easy, then.
Oh!"
- Pump up the volume...
- "Billy Bragg!
Billy Bragg!"
- As you can see, they look like flying goggles.
- Yeah, yeah.
And that's what they are, but they're not for flying.
- Then they're not flying goggles.
- JO:
Driving.
- They are for...
- Don't be picky, he doesn't like that.
They are for pilots.
They're for night pilots.
- It's so they can acclimatise their eyes for darkness.
- Oh.
- Oh!
So they go to the canteen where the lady says...
- ALAN SPEAKS GERMAN - .."Flying tonight, love?"
Cos if you're flying tonight, you've got extra eggs and bacon because the chances were you wouldn't come back.
I would say that rather they make everyone you bump into
- look like a Dutch prostitute.
- Yeah, there is an element of that.
Dance for me, Stephen!
Dance for me.
Oh!
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE
You made me!
All right.
You are a unique individual, if you don't mind me saying.
Have a go.
Why can't I dance without people laughing?
!
- I don't understand!
- You bring joy, you're like...
I missed that lesson that everybody else went to at school where they were taught how to dance at a discotheque.
LAUGHTER
Anyway, Alan, what have you got that's optical?
- It looks like an ordinary pair of glasses.
- Yeah, it is.
And it has three...
Put them on and describe what you see.
LAUGHTER
- You won't be surprised to hear that my vision is somewhat obscured.
- Yes.
LAUGHTER
- But look at the audience.
- They make three...
And what do I...?
What can you see?
Can you see...?
They're kind of like binoculars, where you can see...
- Can you see me doing anything?
- No.
Are they not working, Alan?
Dance.
Dance!
Whoa!
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE
Are they meant to be for peripheral vision?
- They were designed for drivers who had...
- Jesus!
LAUGHTER
Who had bad eyesight and it was to improve their peripheral vision.
But it clearly doesn't work!
There'd be no chance of driving in these!
You'd just be like that all the time!
LAUGHTER
Well, that's unfortunate.
Well...
But thank you for trying them and next up is Josh.
- What have you got?
- They're very fashionable, aren't they?
Yeah.
No, what you haven't done though...
PHILL: "I will take the red pill."
LAUGHTER
- What you haven't...
- Oh, I see!
Yeah, you haven't...fully...
exploited their...
Exactly, what have you got there?
Corners.
- Now put them on.
- Oh!
No, they're exactly the same...
If I were to tell you that these are, despite their modern look, they're actually WAY over 100 years old.
They're mid-19th century.
What do you think they might help with?
- Um...
- If I were to say one of the great British love stories...
Oh!
- Wow.
- Very good.
- They just keep getting...
- Yeah, the gift that keeps giving.
But one of the great British love story movies.
Strangers On A Train...
No.
- You're in the right area.
- Brief Encounter.
Brief Encounter.
How do they meet, Celia Johnson and Trevor Howard in Brief Encounter?
- Train station?
- It was...
He...
- She leans out the window...
And pokes him in the eye.
She gets something in her eye?
She gets a smut in her eye, he's a doctor, he comes with a hanky...
The basic thing is...
From the open carriage days of railways onwards, because of steam, smuts, so on, people got really stung in the eyes.
- And these were railway spectacles.
- I'm sorry, who's speaking now?
LAUGHTER
That makes no sense!
And yet it's funny.
So, if she'd had a pair of these, that wouldn't have been quite the film it was, would it?
It really wouldn't.
It would've lasted about ten minutes.
If he'd had a pair of these on, he'd have poked her eye out!
I think I could tell what they do better, Josh, if you'd dance for me.
LAUGHTER
APPLAUSE
- Never got that reaction before!
- Yeah.
I wish I'd brought more Edam.
Is that a kind of ecstasy cheese?
Oh, there's a thing the drug dealers haven't thought of...
- Ecstasy cheese!
- ..psychotropic cheeses!
- ALAN:
Edam.
- Edam.
Jo, it's your turn.
Oh, you've got a bonnet.
Lovely bonnet.
Oh, and something hanging from it, there you are.
LAUGHTER
How cool is THAT?
That's great, isn't it?
You are Mrs Norris in Mansfield Park.
It's a Jane Austen moment.
"Holmes, I never realised it was you!"
I can't see a bloody thing through it, though.
What am I supposed to be able to see?
I honestly think you look absolutely gorgeous.
If there had been...
If there had been a character from Mansfield Park in Colditz, she...
"So...
"So, you vish to escape from mein prison camp.
"Not before we have done a little embroidery, no?"
LAUGHTER
I think it's more sort of Dickensian, isn't it?
Like Mrs Gamp, the elderly prostitute.
"I say, sir, let me see your penis."
Now, this is what these goggles were for!
She's got the idea, that one!
These are definitely Dutch.
- I'm going to have to... - "Even with my monocle, it's awfully small."
Oh!
You know how to make a man feel very, very unhappy.
SHE MOUTHS
Enough, enough.
I have...
I have the most delicate from this museum...
It's a fan.
It's an eventail.
Beautiful fan, for fanning yourself, obviously, but it has a secret lens in the middle, so I can see what you're doing.
So it allows people who apparently are fanning themselves and not taking any notice of anyone else to have a very...
- I'm not going to lie to you...
- Yeah.
There is a slight different technique when you start looking at me to when you're fanning yourself.
- STEPHEN LAUGHS
- Mm!
God, you're really fanning yourself very slowly there, Stephen.
Rrrreow!
- Yeah...
- I think I'm putting these back on.
- Yes, and they were very popular.
- I've just actually...
A friend of mine....
Cos, like, opera glasses always seem really
- old-fashioned, don't they?
- Aren't they?
Mm.
And he was at the theatre with his elderly aunt, she'd never seen them before, and she said, "How do these work?"
He said, "You just put your money in
"and then you can see what's going on onstage," and she went,
"Can't see a thing!"
LAUGHTER
Oh, that's very sweet.
So, good, excellent.
Name something this lizard is doing as well as running.
ORGAN MUSIC PLAYS
Yes, Josh?
Is he worrying what's wrong with his legs?
He might be.
I don't think lizards ever worry.
He looks quite cheerful.
- What might he be doing, what do all animals do, virtually?
- Hunting?
- Hunting, yeah.
- Sniffing.
- Sniffing, what does that involve?
- Breathing.
- Well, uses its tongue.
- What do you mean, what does it involve?
- Breathing?
- Breathing, Josh said.
- KLAXON SOUNDS
Oh!
Sorry.
I was cruel, I pushed you on that.
He's not breathing.
That's the strange thing about lizards, they have to twist their bodies so much that it compresses their lungs and they can't breathe.
So, they do a bit of a run and then they stop, as we'll see.
He's running, running, running, not breathing at all, and then he thinks, "Oh, blimey, I need some oxygen!"
- He'll stop.
- STEPHEN PANTS
It's only when he's straight, only when he's heteros...
No, only when he's straight... that he can...
That's just silly, makes no sense.
- ..that he can breathe.
- You were like the Oxbridge Johnny Morris, then.
"He's running along, baaa, oh, no."
But we have an example.
The fastest humans on Earth run which race?
- 100 metres.
- The 100 metres, and it's said that some 100-metres sprinters don't breathe throughout the race.
I mean, they obviously take gulps in, oxygenate themselves, get all ready, like that, and then they're running and...
And you see them in slow motion, going...
And then lower down,
"Phedabida, phedabida, phedabida." And, um...
LAUGHTER
- Is that the noise it makes?
- That's the noise it makes.
- Wow.
When it reaches 20mph, that's the noise it starts to make.
Wow!
Yeah, exactly.
"Phedabida!"
♪ Doo doo, do-do-do. ♪ LAUGHTER
I happen to have a friend who was a judge
- in the Linford Christie lunch box case...
- Lookalike competition!
- No, lunch box case.
- Oh.
- Who's that?
I can't remember what it was about, but there was this issue of his lunch box came up, Linford Christie's lunch box, and the judge said, "What exactly IS a lunch box?"
And I teased him about it, and he said,
"No, no, I want you to understand I knew exactly what it meant,
"but I have to ask on behalf of the jury,"
that's why judges are always quoted as saying,
"And so what is a muppet precisely?
"Are you saying he was a member of the Beatles?
"Are you saying he was a ladybird, or some sort of...?"
No, it's...
But, yeah.
- I've got a thing.
Has anyone else got...
- Have you, darling?
- LAUGHTER
- And it goes "phedabida".
LAUGHTER
- I can't walk and drink at the same time.
- Ah.
I really struggle with it.
- Is that normal?
- No, I think it is.
Who wants to throw in their...
Well, I think you'd have to go slowly, because the motion creates a wave
- that will slop over the side of the glass.
It's just...
- Exactly.
..physics.
LAUGHTER
Yeah, the ability to do two things at once.
We can ask the audience and we can ask you, it's easier for the audience cos of the way they're sitting down.
All you have to do is revolve your right foot clockwise.
That's easy, isn't it?
And then, with your right hand, make a six.
Is your foot suddenly going...?
- Oh, wow!
That's weird!
- Oh, I don't like that.
- Isn't that extraordinary!
What was it?
What foot?
Right foot.
That's weird.
- Right foot clockwise.
- Yeah.
- And then do a six.
- You have to think about it.
- You really do, don't you?
- Oh!
Oh!
That was instant!
You really have to think about it to the point where you nearly break your foot off.
You forget what's clockwise.
And you start going up and down and not...
Argh, argh, no!
- I'm absolutely fighting it!
- You're in agony.
But I couldn't do the six, I couldn't finish the six.
I just did a C.
Yes.
Exactly.
It's a bitch, isn't it?
It's really fascinating.
Oh, I'm going to remember that one.
People say, "What do you remember from QI?" And I remember nothing!
- Even if you watch your foot.
- Yeah.
I mean, this isn't great television, what I'm doing at this moment.
You can raise your foot, put your foot on the desk if you want.
Right, so...
- glad I wore my natty socks today.
- Yeah, they've very natty.
Argh!
It is fascinating, isn't it?
I can't even remember what a six looks like!
LAUGHTER
Oh, little Alan, I'm so sorry!
I won't able to walk, I'll be going...
"Aah, help me-e-e-e!"
Just tracks on the pavement.
- Well, you're absolutely right.
- Like a Dalek on the stairs.
Did you find that when you were filming Jonathan Creek or something that sometimes you suddenly kind of forget how to walk?
Because the camera's on you and...
"Oh, do I?
How...
Oh!"
- Do you ever get that or...?
- (No.)
- No.
Oh, well...
- LAUGHTER
- Damn you!
- Sorry!
All right.
Lizards can't breathe and walk at the same time and our audience are even worse.
Lizards have four legs, but what's got eight legs, sits in the middle of a spider's web, but is NOT a spider?
ORGAN MUSIC PLAYS
- Jo Brand?
- One and a half flies.
LAUGHTER
- And the half a fly has lost a leg.
- Wouldn't that be nine legs?
No, and the half has lost a leg, that's been eaten.
- In theory, that is right.
- If...
Yes, why...
Don't you hate it when you try and help a spider and it resists you, and then one of its legs comes off.
- Don't you hate that?
- That is so annoying!
Just get on the paper!
And daddy-longlegs, they're even worse.
- Yeah, they are.
- You'd think the spider could do the six and the clockwise with its two legs.
It probably can, EASILY.
Yeah, it's laughing up its sleeve at us.
If they have sleeves, eight sleeves, it's laughing up its eight sleeves.
This does seem very bizarre.
It sits in the middle of a web, has eight legs, looks exactly like a spider, but it isn't a spider.
Is it an unlucky octopus?
- A beached octopus.
- A beached octopus!
- Well, given...
- Is it some sort of predator that wants to eat spiders?
- Is it one of those?
- Actually, it's the reverse.
It's a spider that wants to DETER predators, so it creates a fake spider.
- Shut up!
- There.
That's made of its dead skin, it's made of leaf mould.
It's made of all kinds of bits and pieces.
There you can see the sort of body, you only see four of the legs there, it's already making a woman in the audience wet herself.
LAUGHTER
- Did someone just make that?
- A spider did.
- Oh, is that real?
- Spiders make them.
That's the point, they make them.
- Is that to scale?
- Well, it's...
Almost, in the sense that it's five times bigger than the actual spider.
So, the spider is quite small and it makes this enormous spider, and sometimes, it lives in a pouch in the abdomen, and no-one's quite sure why.
They think it may be to deter predators, because it looks too big, or it may be to suggest to other spiders that you can't steal this web,
- because it's occupied.
- It's like a scarecrow, really, isn't it?
Basically, yeah.
Or turning your lights on in your house to put burglars off.
- It may just be a hobby.
- Yes.
LAUGHTER
When your life is sitting in the corner of a shed eating flies...
- You need a hobby.
- You've got to have something, haven't you?
It is in the middle of the Peruvian jungle, where there are not so many sheds.
They don't even eat them, do they?
They drink them.
They what?
Because they wrap them up in their silky web and then the prey dissolves into a fluid and then they suck it when it's a liquid thing.
- "Hmm, that's good eatin'." Yeah, isn't it?
- Yeah.
The amazing thing is, and this is really extraordinary, is that another species of spider altogether, as far away as you can virtually get on the planet,
11,000 or so miles away, across from Peru in the Philippines, does almost exactly the same thing and nobody knows if that's convergent evolution or whether it's...
It'd be a weird raft that managed to get all the way across that amount of water.
- It's just God, Stephen, it's just God.
- Just God.
LAUGHTER
I overlooked that possibility.
- Mysterious ways, mysterious ways.
- Very mysterious ways.
So, that's the Peruvian spider that makes huge models of itself.
Are those spiders to scale?
LAUGHTER
Because, I'm telling you now,
Japan are going to be all over that.
IN JAPANESE ACCENT:
"Oh, no!
Giant spider, no!"
I quite like this map behind Alan, because it looks like...
"And now the spider forecast with Alan Davies.
"South America, large, red."
It's like when you're on a plane and they have the map with the little plane, if you turned it on and it was that, you'd shit yourself.
It always has such random cities on it as well, doesn't it?
- It doesn't have like Paris, Rome, Venice.
- Yeah, King's Lynn!
- LAUGHTER
- Yeah, exactly, it's very strange.
I never quite understood that.
Very peculiar.
Anyway!
Peruvian spiders make huge models of themselves and put them in the middle of their webs.
Speaking of things with lots of legs, why can I never seem to catch the perfect centipede?
ORGAN MUSIC PLAYS
- Yes, Jo?
- Is it cos you're too pissed all the time?
LAUGHTER
- Why, thank you for that(!
)
- Just a guess.
A lucky guess!
Cos they don't have 100 legs.
- They don't have 100 legs.
- No.
- Well remembered!
- They don't.
We had it on this show.
- We did.
- LAUGHTER
But it was a long time ago.
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
You're absolutely right, but that's not the reason one won't catch a perfect one cos you could have a perfect one that had...98 legs because what would 98 legs mean?
That it had how many pairs of legs?
- 49. - 49.
49.
But why can't it have 100?
That'd be 50 pairs...
- No reason.
- There is a reason.
- Does it have to have an odd number of pairs?
Yes, an odd number of pairs.
For some reason, all centipedes have an odd number of pairs of legs but that's not the reason I can never catch a perfect one, cos a perfect centipede would have, say, 102 legs.
The legs are amazing.
- Astounding.
- They go in a kind of wave.
Yes, they do.
It's not...
Not at the moment cos it's climbing, but when it starts walking, they go in a wave.
Ooh!
- LAUGHTER
- Yeah.
- That's only got about...
- If only they were massive, I wish they were massive and they went down the - high street.
Oh, don't!
No, but nice and benign and friendly - "Hello, morning!"
Like if all vicars were centipedes or something.
- It's just a fact of life, everyone just accept it.
- Yeah.
Anyway, moving on...
If I caught a 102-footed centipede that would be a perfect centipede, but I'm talking about why I can't catch a perfect one.
They're elusive.
They are elusive, but that would be not being able to catch one.
Is it cos nobody's perfect?
LAUGHTER
That's a lovely point.
No, it's really because if you chase them
- and you start to try and catch them...
- Their legs fall off.
- They jettison legs.
- They throw them at you.
- Well, they kind of do.
- LAUGHTER
That's basically what they do!
Exactly!
LAUGHTER
They do!
You've got it.
That's what they do.
APPLAUSE
In order to distract a predator, they jettison their legs.
So, it stops, the predator will go,
"Ooh, I'll have an eat of that leg," and meanwhile, they're haring off.
- God's weird, isn't he?
- He really is.
A strange fellow.
Very strange fellow.
And there are lizards that use a similar technique in Pakistan, the leopard gecko has a tail that it can shed, which will keep moving for really quite a considerable time after it's been discarded, about...
- Keep moving, you say?
- Yep.
Yeah, that's one hot gecko.
It's called autotomy.
It is self-amputation, if you like, but it literally will drop its tail and the tail will wiggle for half an hour after it's been separated from the parent body, which is...
As you say, God is amazing.
Yeah, so there you go.
Autotomy.
And speaking of abandoned body parts, which body part beginning with L did Queen Victoria leave with the Empress of France?
There's Queen Victoria, and there's the...
- I was going to say labia and that would be just awful.
- I know.
What were you going to say?
- KLAXON SOUNDS
- Oh!
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Oh, dear, dear, dear, dear, dear.
- We're off!
- Is it her little finger?
- Liver, larynx.
- Is it a lock of hair?
- Lock of hair is the right answer!
- CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
- Brilliant!
But she virtually invented this sort of
Victorian sentimental obsession with locks of hair.
When her husband died, she kept lots of Albert's hair, but she gave...
- They've taken the photo away, but really...
- I know.
..she looks so pissed off that her crown doesn't fit her.
- It just looks like a complete...
- Shall we go back?
- Yes, can we?
"No, honestly, it's absolutely meant to be this size."
"It doesn't fit me!" "Yes, yes, honestly, it's exactly as intended."
"It's for a child!" "No, no, no..."
- The Empress is going, "My bonnet's perfect."
- It is.
It's rather like Jo's bonnet.
It was, your monocle bonnet.
Yeah, exactly.
Aw, you could be the Empress of France.
Double vision.
Yes.
Do you think I could be the Empress of France?
- Easily. - "Let them eat cake!"
So, let's cut to what she gave.
It was a bracelet made of her own hair.
It's an astonishing gift.
But this was what Victorians were obsessed with.
Knitting, braiding, plaiting, making things out of hair.
Artists powdered hair down.
Do you remember those things, as a child, when you would put glue, like Pritt, the non-sticky sticky stuff on it, and then you would sprinkle glitter?
Do you remember that?
- Copydex.
- Or Copydex you could use, which smelt slightly chlorinous
- and was a wonderfully...
- Semen.
LAUGHTER
- Not angry.
- BOTH:
Disappointed.
LAUGHTER
Dear me.
Oh, well.
Yeah.
That's what artists would do, they would put glue on and then they'd sprinkle the powdered hair.
So, hair was a big kind of deal.
Lord Byron was considered the most handsome and extraordinary figure.
There you can see a little locket hanging...
Although it's beautifully made as a braid and with gold, as you can see, and that could be made to fit into a waistcoat or something, for a man's...
"Here you go, Lady Casterby,
"this watch chain is made of my pubes.
"Ha-ha!
And now a poem!"
LAUGHTER
Well, Lord Byron didn't necessarily give his own hair away, it's that he was so handsome and so adored that...
- LAUGHTER
- That's a painting!
But what was wrong with his hands?
It was generally agreed by all who met and knew him, he was a hugely charming man.
According to his own diaries anyway.
"Lady Tappleton..."
No, no, he had...
Letters were written to him, women sent him locks of their own hair.
So he used locks of his Newfoundland dog, which he sent back to the women, which they didn't notice, they thought it was Byron's hair.
"Lady Suffolk,
"I apologise for giving you mange with my latest gift.
"But meanwhile, I shall come round to your house and I shall rotate
"my right foot and draw a six in the air.
Ha-ha!
Poem?"
There's a good reason why that might have been difficult for Lord Byron.
- Oh, of course, yes, yes.
- He had a dodgy foot.
Despite that, he managed to achieve a great athletic feat.
- He swam.
- He swam the...?
- Hellespont.
- Straits of somewhere.
- The Hellespont!
You know these things, you pretend to be an ignorant pig.
- LAUGHTER
- I only went...
- I mean, sorry!
You pretend...
- An ignorant what?
No, I meant to say you pretend to be pig-ignorant!
- LAUGHTER
- And it came out wrong!
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE
Know what I'm going to do with you?
I'm going to make you run across a field and I'm going to pull all your legs and arms off...
I don't want to lower the tone, but didn't Lady Caroline Lamb
- pull out handfuls of her pubic hair and send them to Byron?
- Yes.
And she was responsible for the most famous description of him.
- Yes.
- "Mad, bad and dangerous to know."
"Dangerous to have tea with."
Fabulous woman.
There was a movie about her, I think Sarah Miles...
- Yeah.
- JO:
Oh, that's right.
Yeah.
Yeah, Sarah Miles, she used to drink her own pee.
- Yes, she was a urinobibe.
- Yep.
As was the Prime Minister of India, Morarji Desai, who became prime minister at the age of 80.
And he drank his pee every day.
Anyway, the Empress Eugenie, her name was, and she was the wife of Napoleon III.
There's Eugenie.
She had a fantastic real name -
Dona Maria Eugenia Ignacia Augustina de Palafox-Portocarrero de Guzman y Kirkpatrick.
- That was her name.
- Kirkpatrick.
Yeah.
- APPLAUSE
- Thank you.
- Crikey.
But what was very pleasing is that she was known as "Carrots".
Because that was her nickname at school in Bristol, where she lived, and she died in Britain as well.
I had no idea that we had a hipster Napoleon.
- Yeah, he was a hipster, yeah.
- Check him out.
- Yeah, he's pretty good. - "Er, can I have a flat white, please?"
LAUGHTER
"No, the jacket, I got it in this vintage place, it's great."
Yes.
Queen Victoria gave the Empress of France a bracelet made of her own hair.
We move now to a less lovely L - why would you put a leech on a leash?
Is it a medicinal leech?
- It's a medicinal leech.
- OK.
So, basically, there are various places you could put it.
Where might you want a leech to go?
No, no!
They've been used for medicinal purposes for centuries.
- They use them in the NHS today, don't they?
- Yes, they absolutely do.
- Do they?
- Yeah.
- You put them on a wound, don't you, and they eat bits that are infected or...
No, that's the maggots.
You put maggots on a wound, and they eat the dead flesh.
Leeches actually...
- Have I travelled back in time?
- No.
LAUGHTER
Those migraine headaches are caused by a demon living in your...
HE IS DROWNED OUT BY LAUGHTER
If you have a member reattached - a finger or some other member - it's kept in ice and then it's sewn back on, and it has a very good prognosis, but you can attach leeches and what it does is
it actually helps the capillaries join together and thrive.
So, it's like a kind of biologically-active cauterising?
Yes, yeah, it's really extraordinary.
- Oh, I don't care, I don't want it.
- Does it hurt?
- It doesn't really hurt much, no.
- How do you know?
Well, I'm told it doesn't hurt.
I don't know, you and your public school ways, and...
- "Fry, time for a leeching!"
- Yeah, it doesn't...
"Scrotum."
"Yes, sir?"
"Get Fry."
It doesn't hurt as much as double...
"It's time for his leeching."
"What do you want, Scrotum?" "It's time for your leeching, Fry."
It doesn't hurt as much as Dr Staveley slamming your dick in the desk, I admit.
It's...
Look, I love to shock you, it's sweet.
Do you remember John Wayne Bobbitt?
- Oh!
- Oh, yeah.
- John Wayne Bobbitt.
Yeah, he went to Winchester...
No, no, of course I remember Bobbitt who severed his wife...
His wife severed his...
Yeah, she cut his penis off and then threw it out the window
- of a moving car, so it took some finding.
- They took him...
They sewed it back on, then he made some money out of porn films, weirdly!
Yeah, he must have been rather impressed that a penis that took some finding was found.
He must have thought, "Yes!"
Let's hope they found the right one, that would have been a disaster!
- LAUGHTER
- Stop it.
Yeah.
I can imagine him at the line-up.
"Can I see number three again?"
You're too used to that programme, that's just sick.
Yep, they were often popped up on a leash, up the bottom, to deal with intestinal problems.
- Oh, up the inside?
- Yep, or down the throat to deal with bronchial problems.
- Ooh.
- Yeah, exactly.
I know, or you could actually use them on the scrotum for strained testicles.
Have you ever had strained testicles?
- I'd rather have leeches on my balls.
- JOSH:
What, as a pudding?
Hang on!
- One doctor wrote...
- Yeah, strained testicles and custard.
That's what prunes are.
That's prunes.
Yeah, and as I say, these days they're used to encourage capillary growth on severed members.
Doctors USED to put leeches on leashes to send them up patients' bottoms.
Now, what did Georgian gentlemen keep in the sideboard for after dinner?
Small Georgian ladies.
- After Eights.
- After Eights!
LAUGHTER
Porn.
After 1713, it would be.
Porn.
Well, actually, it was something that disgusted a French observer and he wrote about it in a letter.
So, you've got a chance here for serious points.
Ah, Alan, quickly!
Shut up, he's done it before me!
JAUNTY JINGLE, FLUSHING
Oh, there we are, two of you, three of you.
You all get the points except Jo, I'm afraid.
The fact is, it was chamber pots.
It was Rochefoucauld, not the famous Rochefoucauld, but another Rochefoucauld, Francois de la Rochefoucauld, who wrote in his diary "The sideboard..."
This was in Suffolk, in 1784,
"The sideboard is garnished also with chamber pots in line
"with the common practice of going over to the sideboard to pee,
"while the others are drinking.
"Nothing is hidden.
I find that very indecent."
Chamber pots lasted well into the 20th century, because there were many households that weren't on mains supplies.
- Many of them...
- They didn't have a WC.
Exactly, they had outdoor loos and they popped a chamber pot under the bed.
And chamber pots were, I won't say exactly witty, but they had things written on them which were quite surprising, really, thinking of a previous age where you imagine people were rather more prudish.
Look at these.
"Use me well and keep me clean.
"And I'll not tell what I have seen."
So, you pooed onto an eye.
Or you peed onto an eye.
And there were some during the Second World War that had a picture of Hitler, so you could poo on Hitler's face.
Which is pleasing in a way.
That's your chamber pot.
Now, it's time to dip the crouton of confidence into the all-melting fondue of General Ignorance.
What kind of wine goes best with a human liver?
Oh!
A Chianti.
- Whoa!
- KLAXON SOUNDS
That's what Hannibal Lecter says.
- That's what he says in...
- In Silence Of The Lambs.
- "I'll have some fava beans and a fine Chianti."
- What are fava beans to...?
- Little white beans, aren't they?
- To reclaim your...
- What would we call them in England?
- Butter beans?
Broad beans?
Broad beans, yeah, you get a few points back from the massive deficit that you've already...
Um, yeah, it's in the novel.
Who wrote the novels involved with...?
- Thomas Harris.
- Thomas Harris is right.
He, being rather sort of smart and giving Hannibal Lecter good taste, knew that something fatty and greasy like a liver is not complemented well by a Chianti.
He knew that it was best accompanied by something a little more full-bodied.
Something like, for instance, an Amarone, which is what is in the novel.
Which is a sort of Valpolicella-type wine,
- and that is...
- Why did they change it, Stephen?
Because they felt most people hadn't heard of an Amarone and they might think it was some sort of biscuit or something.
They're quite correct.
It sounds like an amaretto.
- It is like an amaretto, exactly.
- What, Hollywood dumbing something down?
- Yeah, I know, it's hard to believe, isn't it?
- What the F?
!
"White wine with meat?
Eurgh!"
But why would it have been a rather disastrous decision to eat
- a human liver anyway?
- Toxic?
- Yes, they are toxic.
- Do you know what the toxin is?
- No.
- Is it vitamin something?
- Yes.
- Vitamin E?
- Actually, A.
- A.
A lot of vitamins can't be stored.
As you know, vitamin C, you pee out the residue, so the idea of taking these 5,000 milligrams a day is just...
- That's why you have bright yellow wee.
- Exactly.
You're giving the rats the vitamin C.
You're giving the rats the vitamins, precisely!
They grow more and more immune and stronger daily!
"Why, they'll be as powerful as the Prime Minister of India!"
"I'm recycling!"
But, yeah, the liver, it stores vitamin A, which in excess can be quite dangerous.
Helps you see at night, though.
Livers can regenerate themselves, did you know that?
- Like Doctor Who.
- Like Doctor Who, yeah.
There's the liver drawn by...
- Da Vinci.
- Yeah, Leonardo, and you can see there his famous mirror writing, which is...
I know the drawings are amazing enough, but as a boy,
I tried using a mirror to write mirror writing, it's just...
I mean, you think drawing a six with your hand and doing a...
Why did he do that?
No-one's quite sure why he wanted it to be secret, but he did.
- For Dan Brown!
- Yes!
- LAUGHTER
- For the one who was...
- Whoooo!
Whoooo!
"There's secrets in the Vatican, Josh.
Let's go and find them."
I'm genuinely uncomfortable in this situation.
If you use those goggles you can see the map.
PHILL GASPS No?
!
The amazing thing, the magical thing about livers is if you take a small liver from a small dog, and you transplant it into a large dog, the small liver will grow to the size it would have been in the bigger dog, which is extraordinary.
- (Shut up!
)
- Wow.
Yes.
You see, I often run out of things to do with the children at weekends.
- Now you know.
- We're going to try that.
Yeah.
Now, also you know a fantastic slang word and it's a liver-disturber, and it's American 19th-century slang for?
- An alcoholic?
- No.
A huge dong.
- A huge dong?
- Yeah, a liver-disturber!
ALL GROAN
- Oh!
- Oh!
We think...
Exactly!
We think WE'RE sick?
!
These are Victorian Americans!
"I got a tonsil-troubler!"
LAUGHTER
Have you heard the prank call...
A guy phones up the pizza place and he goes, "Do you deliver?"
- Oh, no!
- And he says, "Yes, we deliver."
And he goes, "All right, I'll have liver, cheese, onion, olives..."
"We don't have any liver."
"Do you DELIVER?"
"Yes, we deliver." "Right, I'll have liver..."
- And it goes on...
- Oh, that is...
It's very likely on the interweb.
It's very funny.
Excellent, I'll look it up.
Now, who sat in the middle at the Last Supper?
- SPANISH ACCENT:
Jesus.
- Jesus?
Oh...
KLAXON SOUNDS
No matter how you pronounce it, it wasn't he.
JOSH:
Judas.
Nor was it Judas, the traitor.
- Peter.
- No-one.
Nor was it Peter.
No-one is the right answer.
- No-one's in the middle.
- No, it's not that no-one was in the middle... it's that no-one sat.
- Oh, shut up, they're all standing!
- Yeah!
- LAUGHTER
- No, they're not standing.
FUNNY ACCENT:
Shut up!
You shut up!
LAUGHTER
- I don't shut up, you shut up!
- LAUGHTER
You don't tell me to shut up!
No, the...
Stop, stop it now!
Just stop it now!
The thing is, in Palestine, which was a Roman province, they ate like Romans.
They lay on their stomachs like Romans.
That can't be good for digestion, can it?
No, you'd think not, but we know that's the way they ate, more or less, because in the Bible,
"Now there was one leaning on Jesus' bosom,
"one of his disciples whom Jesus loved."
And that, you know, you kind of see how that would have worked.
That's how they lay to eat.
Rather pleasing.
- Very odd, though.
- A bit odd, to us, cos we don't do that.
Even in a picnic, you wouldn't want to be lying on your front.
I agree.
I don't like it.
I can't even, you know, a hot chocolate in bed
I have to sit up in order to swallow it.
LAUGHTER
There's nothing...
There is nothing about that that is anything other than straightforward!
We were just immediately thinking of the man who sang
Brother Louie in the '70s, that's all we were thinking.
- # I believe in...
- # I believe in miracles
♪ You sexy thing... ♪
I'll have to sit up now!
LAUGHTER
Oh, lordy, lordy, bless.
Now, nobody sat anywhere at the Last Supper, everyone was lying down.
Well, now, who's in charge of all the ants?
Adam.
LAUGHTER
- KLAXON SOUNDS
- Very good, but...
No!
- Yeah.
We were there before you, I'm afraid.
- Is it a queen?
A queen ant, of course, that's going to get a klaxon as well.
- KLAXON SOUNDS
- Oh.
Is it something like the weather or the climate or something?
- The weather probably is as good an answer as any.
- And they don't control themselves.
The fact is, they are a self-organising colony.
There is no leader.
But there's the queen.
All the queen does is lay thousands and thousands and thousands of eggs in her life and then dies of exhaustion.
And the ants just get on with being ants and there are just signals sent between each one that somehow sort of ripple outwards into what appears to be organisation.
But it's a bit like flocks of starlings or shoals of mackerel that have this incredible sort of...
You think, "What's the intelligence behind this?"
It's like the Tartan Army.
LAUGHTER
No-one knows how they do it, but they do it.
They somehow do it.
Exactly.
The way, at a football match, a chant will grow and then suddenly die.
You think, "That's...
Who's organising that?" and no-one is.
It's just a sort of feature of large groups.
It's very odd.
And that's true of ants, who are, you know, and termites.
- They love football, don't they?
- They love football.
They do indeed.
- North ants, in particular.
LAUGHTER AND APPLAUSE
It seems there's no-one in charge of the ants, but there is someone in charge of the scores, and that's me or I.
And it's very interesting, because in first place, with a positive integer, one point, Phill Jupitus!
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
On minus six, in second place,
Jo Brand!
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Highly respectable - for him, it's a triumph - on minus 26, Alan Davies!
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
So, now, looky here, on minus 30, Josh Widdicombe!
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
And so it's thanks and good night from Josh, Phill, Jo, Alan and me.
And we leave you with some last words.
The last words of American murderer
James Allen Red Dog, executed in 1993.
"I'd like to thank my family and friends and Mr Pankowski
"for supporting me and all the others who treated me with kindness.
"For the rest of you, y'all can kiss my ass." Good night.
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
Synced and corrected by Katniss Everdeen.
The '60s, man.
Influential musicians like Bob Dylan and Joan Baez...
Playing guitars and singing like prophets.
The times, they were a-changin'.
The class, they are a-sleepin'.
It's not your fault, dad.
It's just the stuff you're saying.
I'm talking about the '60s, man.
Nobody cares about when you were our age.
Riley, it was over 50 years ago.
How old do you guys think I am?
There's no right answer to this, sir.
You should teach us future class, listen, dad, you're doing a wonderful job up there and we're very happy that you're all jazzed up...
But history has nothing to do with us.
I'm gonna snap this chalk now.
- Uh-oh.
- Snap.
What did you guys do yesterday?
I think I had grapes.
Do you know what yesterday was?
Grapes day.
It's history.
Every decision you make every day, every time you decide to turn left instead of right, you make history and you affect someone else's.
And if you refuse to learn that, I guarantee you, you guys will not become the best person you can be.
Because history is all about missed opportunities.
"History has nothing to do with us," wasn't it, Ms. Hart?
Can't remember, it was like five minutes ago.
Fine.
I am not gonna teach you guys about the '60s.
Yay.
You are.
Yay.
History is alive even if you weren't.
But now you're gonna be.
You will visit the 1960s and give a report.
Time travel.
How do we do that, dad?
We weren't there.
- You were.
- How?
You all have grandparents or great-grandparents.
Choose one who was around during that time.
Learn all you can about them and report back.
Then we'll see if history has nothing to do with us.
Living history...
Now I'm all jazzed up.
Yay.
You're a new face.
So are you, but everything's new to me... the people, the places, the whole happening scene, man.
First time you ever said that, isn't it?
I practiced the whole way here.
Let me get a vibe.
I dig you immedia-tois.
What does that mean?
I don't know.
I made it up.
Well, here's what I want you to make up for me:
A hot chocolate with extra whipped cream, because I'm dangerous.
You got a name, dangerous?
Rosie.
Rosie McGee.
- What's yours?
- Ginsburg.
Nice to meet you, Rosie.
What's the picture for?
For the moment we first met.
I'll get your hot chocolate, McGee.
I know this is weird, but have we met before?
Haven't we all?
Welcome, to Cafe Hey, pronounced, "hehhh."
Hehhh.
You're getting better at that.
Tonight's gonna be legendary, man.
Let's just see what flows.
Black.
White.
Green.
Tan.
No one listen to the man.
Freedom is the only plan.
Free to be who you am.
Can't you see?
That you... are... me.
Karma.
Whatcha writing?
Oh!
Just... observations.
You know, thoughts about the people I meet.
These are deep, man.
You're one deep chick.
Chick?
Down here I'm a chick.
Why'd you come here tonight, Rosie?
I came to make some new friends.
You see, there's two tables over there:
The one the left, Bob and Joan;
table on the right, a blonde girl all alone.
She's new around here, too.
Go left or right.
What to do?
Karma.
You are really interesting looking.
Are you as interesting as you look?
Sure, are you as weird as you talk?
Oh my gosh.
Yeah, man.
I am the weirdest cat there is.
Really?
'Cause you seem like a nice, normal girl to me.
You figured me out in five seconds and you've hurt me.
How can I make that up to you?
Could we be friends?
I would be a very good friend to you.
Yeah, I could use a weird friend.
Then you should pick...
Oh, they both landed on me.
All right, status report.
I got a guitar that belonged to my great-grandmother Rosie, and her very weird journal.
My dad is sending something about my great-grandfather.
We don't talk about him much.
His name was Merlin.
Merlin?
Was he a wizard?
Hah!
Okay, Farkle Minkus.
What was your great-grandfather's name?
Ginsburg.
You make no sense to me whatsoever.
Whatcha looking at?
Art book.
Ms. Kossal gave it to me.
It's got all the best artists and their best paintings.
It's amazing...
And depressing.
She's trying to motivate you.
Ain't working.
Look at these.
I could never do anything near this.
These people all have something to say.
Well, you only know that because they went ahead and said it.
You know, someday you're gonna make somebody a wonderful fortune cookie.
Let me take a picture of everybody.
What for?
I don't know.
It's us.
We may be important to somebody someday.
You guys are already important to me.
How?
You teach me how to be friends.
Aww...
Maya, aren't you bringing that?
What, this book of...
"Why bother trying I'll never be as good as these guys"?
That's a very discouraging title.
I love you, Riley, but I'm leaving this here.
It makes me feel bad and...
It's really heavy.
You're making me feel bad.
There's some pretty heavy stuff in here.
"The girl with the long, blonde hair."
Who's that about, I wonder.
It's my first time here and I would like to remember everything.
Maybe I'll write about it later.
It's my first time here, too.
I'm on my way to California.
My bus broke down, bad luck.
I don't understand why these things happen.
Because if you're bus doesn't break down, then we don't become friends.
If I go sit at that table instead of this table, then I'm not friends with...
May Clutterbucket.
Yow.
What's in California for you, may?
I'm going to say Clutterbucket now.
But just so you know, when I say it I am not making fun of you.
Well, there's a place where people are making art and playing music.
Sounds cool.
Where is it?
It's a place called Topanga Canyon.
I'm sure I'll love it.
Topanga...
What a beautiful name for something that you want to love.
I'm gonna remember that.
May, take the stage, may.
You're up.
What's your name, new friend?
Rosie McGee.
Wish me luck, Rosie McGee.
Wow, you're going to sing?
I'm going to try.
Yay, go get 'em!
And remember, you're beautiful, man.
Wow!
I'll remember, because that was great.
Let's hear it for may clutterbucket.
What are you laughing at, Bob Dylan?
Merlin.
Merlin Scoggins.
Take the stage, cowboy.
Who the heck is that?
So that's him.
I've heard about him.
Hello.
I'm Merlin Scoggins.
Hello.
I'm Lucas Friar.
My great-grandpa used to do that.
He was a man named Merlin Scoggins.
And this record was a big hit.
That's amazing, Lucas.
Why didn't you ever tell us any of that?
Yeah, I'm gonna tell Maya I have a country-singing great-grandpa and that I actually do come from cowboys.
Yeah, because I need more nicknames to go with
Hopalong, Sundance and Ranger Rick.
No, I'm done with that.
I am so impressed with your rich, Texas heritage that I am officially throwing out all of those old nicknames forever.
Wow, thank you, Maya.
No problem, Bucky McBoing Boing.
From what I can piece together, my great-grandmother Rosie McGee was a weird, little, wide-eyed goofball who only saw the best in everybody.
Who's like that?
Nobody.
I'd like to play you my great-grandfather's song.
Hello, I'm Merlin Scoggins.
This seat taken?
By you.
See what I did?
Yeah, you're not a normal girl at all.
I liked your song, ma'am.
I liked yours.
And what do you do?
Ah, who knows?
She's an observer of humanity.
Well, we need those.
The observer, the singer, and the mystery man.
That's gotta be worth something to somebody someday.
Well, thank you all for your kind words and I'll be on my way.
Oh, do you have to go?
I try not to stay any place too long...
Especially when people do that.
Stay here with this one too long and she might change us for the better.
Aww...
Yeah, anyway...
You keep writing down those observations.
And you, you keep playing.
What, my new song, "why bother trying, I'll never be as good as you guys"?
That's a very discouraging title.
You have something to say.
Well, now, you only know that, because I went ahead and said it.
Here.
Why are you giving me this?
You were great.
No, he's going to change the world.
I'm not gonna change a thing.
Where are you going?
Don't you worry, weirdo.
I'll be right back.
My great-grandmother never saw her friend again.
The world has never heard of May Clutterbucket.
My great-grandfather had one huge hit.
People thought he was gonna change the world, but... he didn't.
After an appearance in a small cafe in New York City, he made some bad choices.
He went to jail for a little while.
He went left instead of right.
And why do you think that was, Mr. Friar?
Don't know.
Maybe he needed some better friends.
Rosie liked observing things.
I'm going to read something from her journal.
It's called "the girl with the long, blonde hair."
"She said she would be gone for a moment, I am still waiting.
We could have been friends, maybe in some other life.
The girl with the long, blonde hair."
It sounds like Rosie was a pretty good writer.
There's a little bit more.
"If you quiet your voice, if you stop, because you think other people are better, then you are not who I know you are, the girl with the long, blonde hair."
You wrote that.
I continued it.
I am a continuation.
That's what history's about, right, dad?
Oh, now I get it.
Rosie had a daughter, and her daughter had my mom.
Rosie gave me my mom and she gave my dad his wife.
This has been in our family for over 50 years.
But I feel like it belongs with you.
So I hope that whenever you see it, it will remind you that even though Rosie's friend gave up, you never should.
Oh, no.
Hello.
I'm Bucky McBoing Boing.
Everybody!
Hi, I was in here the other day and I lost something that turns out to be important to me.
Thanks.
"Maya's art goes here.
Change the world.
Love, Riley."
Weirdo.
Riley, what is so important?
Really?
I get to sit here with you?
Okay.
Look at this.
"Topanga, what a beautiful name for something you want to love."
Yeah, okay.
We are all part of a puzzle called history.
We are each a tiny piece of that puzzle that comes together and makes a picture.
Well, you're not gonna believe the picture I just found.
My great-grandfather Ginsburg worked at a Greenwich village cafe.
Riley, Lucas, what year did your great-grandparents visit New York?
1961.
Whoa.
I knew it.
What month?
- December.
- Say it again.
Whoa.
And what was the name of the club?
- Cafe...
- Hey.
That's where my great-grandfather worked.
Maya, what did you learn about your great-grandmother?
Nothing, my mom said to leave it alone.
I know you, Maya.
You're not a puzzle to me at all.
You went behind her back and snooped around, didn't you?
No.
What did you find?
No.
Tell me her name.
Say it or I will.
May Clutterbucket.
What?
I come from a long line of Clutterbuckets.
Oh, this is the greatest day of my life!
All of our relatives met each other on the same night.
Your great-grandmother was my great-grandmother's friend.
No.
They never became friends.
She walked out.
She left.
And you didn't tell me?
Tell you what?
That I come from people who give up?
That I am a Clutterbucket?
Change history.
Excuse me?
They would have been better off being friends.
That was a missed opportunity.
Don't let your history be one of missed opportunities.
Learn from the past.
I don't want to be a Clutterbucket.
You're not.
You're all Hart.
On December 14th, 1961, four pieces of a puzzle came together
How great is history class now, everybody?
Shh!
Great-grandfather Ginsburg was hard to research, because he was never in any of the pictures, because he took them.
Ladies and gentlemen, I have achieved time travel.
Thank you.
I am Farkle!
You're early.
Where are we going today, dad?
I thought you guys didn't care about any of that stuff?
No, that was yesterday.
Yesterday is history.
What do you have for us today, Mr. Matthews?
The year was 1963.
"I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
I have a dream today."
Martin Luther King, Jr.
A lot of things happened in 1963.
The '60s, man.
Mawp.
Mawp.
Mawp!
Was that a flashbang?
Sterling?
Mawp?
Ow!
Do something.
What?
I brought roses.
Jesus, Mother, it's just your birthday, not the...
About that!
Oh.
Duh.
Archer!
Lana!
LANA" Lana!"Ugh.
Not her birthday.
Ah!
No, move!
Get away from us!
Yeah, they're shooting at you!
Who?
The storm-ninjas!
What?
That's not a thing, idiot!
Oh.
I stand corrected.
Son of a...!
Bitches, I am pregnant!
Yes!
Who could forget?
With the bastard spawn of a total stranger.
Okay, first of all...
Cover your eyes and ears!
You're not the boss of me!
Meep?
Meep?
What's that, Beaker?
Oh, my God, is Beaker not the best?
Meep, meep, meep!
And wait, what's his, uh... the name of...
Brett!
No, no, no, leave me alone!
Shut up.
Who's Beaker's boss?
What?
Beaker's boss.
Goddamn it, I can't hear...
Brett?
Well, he died doing what he loved.
Getting shot.
Meep.
Meep.
Archer!
Who the hell...
Shut up, it's on the tip of my tongue!
What is?
!
Beaker's boss!
What?
She meant who the hell are these guys, you big dumb idiot asshole!
Said the guy in
What the...?
I just frickin' got here, Ray!
How the hell should I...
No...
No, no, no, no, no, no...
What, what're you...?
Oh.
Oh, boy.
FBI!
Nobody move!
FBI!
Second worst birthday ever.
What?
How is this better than your second fake 50th?
Oh, come on, guys, we talked about this!
You're supposed to yell
"FBI" at the beginning.
After the flashbangs, but before Other Fat Mike gets shot.
Ow.
And what happened with getting "FBI"
on the fronts of the uniforms, huh?
Ow!
Uh, what happened with since when the hell does the frickin' FBI get off...
Sterling Archer?
Yes!
What?
!
I'm Special Agent in
Charge Holly, and you are extremely under arrest.
For what?
Uh, in addition to the attempted murder of a federal agent?
Yes.
Well, there's gonna be just a whole bunch of charges, but mostly treason.
Treason?
What?
Archer, what'd you do?
No, no, not just him.
You, too, Miss Kane.
Yeah.
Everybody.
Especially you, Ms. Archer.
Is this about the fake hydrogen bomb?
No, but let's put a pin in that.
This is about conducting espionage operations, for years, with no authority or permission whatsoever, from the United States government.
Wait, what?
Mother!
Like, 50 times I asked
And like 50 times
I lied.
Sue me.
I want my phone call.
AGENTUh,sir?
It's like you said, he's dug in there like a tick, and...
KRIEGERNever!
You'll never take me alive!
Okay, breach it.
Roger that.
On second thought,
I very much prefer to be taken alive.
Just let me clear the ol' browser history and...
No, no, no, no, no... oof!
Oh, come on!
Ooh, G-man-san.
I'm serious, you are not putting those on me.
Mr. Archer, please turn around and place your hands behind your back.
Or what?
What are you gonna do, taser...
Do me!
Do me!
Do me, do me, do me!
I'm not tasering you, so just...
Do me!
(taser clicking,
Cheryl/Carol groaning)
Thank you.
Ugh.
Our tax dollars hard at work.
Well, not mine, obviously, but...
What's that?
Damn it.
Whatever, Cyril.
I don't care who you are, when you get zapped with 50,000 volts, it's like, like...
Sploosh.
And then it's like wave after wave crashing over you, into you, and...
Will you shut up?
You shut up.
Let her talk.
You shut up!
Make me!
Ow!
Ow!
Jesus!
All of you.
Shut your various holes and listen to me very carefully.
Why, so you can tell us more lies?
Yeah.
So I can save you from life in prison!
Sorry, Ramona, I know to you it's just one big sexy briar patch, but...
You know...
Zip it!
That goes for all of you!
And when we get in there, you keep it zipped.
Because there's a chance I can make this all go away, but only if you people don't try to save your own necks by ratting out everyone else!
Damn it, trust me!
And say nothing!
You heard me, J. Edna.
Not one word.
Well, except for those three.
And then those five.
And...
Archer!
Then that one.
I really shouldn't
I mean, unless you can guarantee me...
Total immunity.
And I mean from everything.
Including anything you find on my computer.
Or in my crawlspace.
Oh, and throw a bone into me.
Excuse me?
I said Ms. Archer had an affair with the head of the KGB for, like, 30 years.
CHERYL/CAROLYeah, until he got blown up.
Which was actually my fault.
Because she was busy having choke-sex with a murderous cyborg, who then became the new head of the KGB.
Until I built a sexier one out of illegal
Soviet parts.
And a corpse.
There was no shortage of dead bodies around ISIS.
One of which belonged to the prime minister
Oh, Jesus, I forgot about the...
Giant pot farm in West Virginia.
And this whole other thing with the Yakuza.
Irish Mob.
Piracy.
White slavery.
No, actual piracy.
With, like, boats.
I want to say...
Burt Reynolds?
Poaching alligators...
Smuggling
Defiling a corpse...
Defiling a different
Kidnapping the Pope...
Faking my own kidnapping!
Arson.
Bumfights!
You know, like when you pay bums to...
Destroy an oil pipeline in...
I want to say
Burt Reynolds.
...Turkmenistan?
Odessa.
You know, the ratlines?
Where you make it look like a murder-suicide,
Is it murder if they were my own clones?
I'm seriously asking.
Oh, because, speaking of sexual assault...
PAMWhichtime?
'Cause for one of 'em
I got a pretty good excuse.
Can I stop you?
Please?
That's what he said.
Inappropriate.
Geez, when you just list everything ISIS has done, it sounds kind of bad.
And so if I were you...
You'd get laid
I'd start talking.
Everybody else is!
They're in there right now, saying he's the brains behind ISIS.
Exactly, I...
Hey, screw you!
Screw you!
Mr. My Mother's A Lying Bitch
And I'm Too Stupid To Realize
My Life's A Pathetic Joke!
Oh, nice to meet you,
Mrs. Hello My Kid's From A Sperm
Bank Since I Can't Keep A Man
Because In Addition To My
Jillion Neuroses
I Have A Weird-looking Vagina!
Okay, knock it off.
Hey!
I can't believe they fell for that.
Ahem.
Miss what?
Sorry, it-it's not that weird look...
Lana!
Thought you were gonna shoot me.
Day's not over.
And seriously, Lana, sorry for what I said.
Then that's where you say...
Good-bye, Archer.
Where do you think you're going?
Not to jail with you and your mother.
Well, you know, we can ask the judge...
You know prisons aren't co-ed, right?
Oh.
Okay, we got to get out of here.
"We"?
There is no
"we" anymore, Archer!
Well, there's this we...
Uh...
Oh, shit.
Yeah.
You're gonna be a great mother.
I could start smoking crack today, and he'd still turn out better than you.
And why is that?
Because I never had a father, Lana?
So why don't you shut up, and then also marry me.
What?
!
I'm serious... we can go underground, get new identities, and spend the rest of our lives together, Lana.
We'll be a family.
You, me, the baby and your not-that-weird-looking vagina.
Okay, don't take this the wrong way... but I would rather lose the baby.
Wha...
I...
Okay, that-that wasn't...
I didn't...
Excuse me.
Jesus Christ, come on, you idiot.
"I have read this statement, each page of which bears my initials, and I do hereby certify..."
"That the facts herein are true and correct, signed Pamela Poovey."
"Cyril Figgis."
"Raymond Q. Gillette."
"Algernop Krieger."
"Cheryl and/or
Carol Tunt."
Now, I would like a ride home, please.
Preferably in an Apache helicopter.
And I believe there was some mention of throwing a bone into me?
What are you talking about?
A penis in my vagina.
Or wherever, but come on, chop-chop,
I got to go start enjoying my immunity.
Yeah, you said immunity.
I didn't.
Dukes!
God!
Damn it!
So is that a
"no" on the Apache, or...?
Oh, my God, okay, so this ditz...
Oh.
Now who's the ditz, huh?
Would you just come on?
I'm seriously asking.
Aw, but look at him.
All tied up like a sexy little Christmas ham.
And can I just go on record as saying
I think this is an extremely bad idea?
You know what's a bad idea?
Prison.
Because, spoiler alert, they're unisex.
Hello, best part.
Yeah?
Uh, uh...
CHERYL/CAROL( oldlady voice):
Oh, Clyde?
Clyde, is that you?
It's me, dear,
Mrs. J. Edgar Hoover's mother.
Um... it's open.
Ma'am.
Nobody move!
Or...
What the hell are you doing?
Getting us out of here.
I've already done that.
Let him go.
And you'll just have to put that on my... whatever... crime tab.
No, no, no, no, no.
Taking a federal agent hostage is a separate charge.
Oh, well, then perhaps we should get him back on the phone.
I... that...
I-I don't...
There's no need to bother the...
Eh, look.
If you'll just sign this form...
Doo, doo, doo.
"In lieu of criminal prosecutions for..."
Doo, doo, doo...
"Treason, I hereby forfeit
ISIS headquarters.
And also agree to permanently cease and desist any and all ISIS operations."
Oh, my God.
Or face a mandatory sentence of life in federal prison without parole.
You got to be kidding me.
"Signed, Malory
Archer."
Oh, my God.
No, uh-uh, nope.
Because correct me if I'm wrong, but that entire document is completely unenforceable.
I correct you.
You are wrong.
For God's sake,
Sterling, it's the government.
Even if it weren't legal, they'd enforce it.
Hey, save it for four ninths of the Supreme Court.
Oh, shut up.
And unless there's anything else?
Uh, just this, releasing the bureau from any claims relating to the death of your employee...
Brett, uh, Bunson?
Oh, my God!
What?
Beaker's boss!
Bunsen frickin' Honeydew!
Woooooo!
That was figuratively killing me.
I can't believe they're taking our building.
Screw the building!
What about our jobs?
Oh, and our health insurance.
Which I'm pretty sure
I'm gonna need.
I'll be your doctor.
Well, if I want
Hitler's DNA spliced into him,
I'll give you a call.
Yeah, I'm around.
Well, as for me, I think I'll start shopping my memoirs.
How does the title
Secrets and Silk grab you?
Tightly by my childhood's throat.
Oh, you're just jealous.
Yeah, jealous of my fallback career.
PAMAswhat?
An actual acorn?
As America's number one country singer.
And kudos.
But for the rest of us trapped in the realm of possibility...
I'm gonna be bigger than Mac Davis.
And Mac Davis can totally suck it.
And you can all suck it because I am gonna play professional lacrosse.
Okay, even if that were a real thing...
Is it not?
...you are way too old.
I am not...
Oh, my God.
I am way too old.
Welp, hope I'm not too old to get back into underground fighting.
Darn.
All those jobs are awesome.
And by awesome you mean delusional.
Because it's gonna be hard to go back to an accounting firm after this job.
Especially after
Mother gives you a shitty reference.
Mother, do that.
I meant it'll be boring.
Although, I guess
I could always go back to being a defense attorney.
When were you ever a lawyer?
Lana, we had long talks about this.
How I went to night school to pass the CPA exam because I was so burned out defending scumbags as a public defender?
Numerous...
long talks.
With me?
Oh, for...
Well, don't come crying to me when that fatherless kid of yours buys a gun and steals a car, and he tries to run but he don't get far!
In the ghetto where Mac Davis sucks it.
Are you done?
Again, seriously asking.
Yes.
So I guess we should talk about the elephant in the room.
Namely...
What are we gonna do with literally, not figuratively, a ton of cocaine?
Well...
Wha...?
Oh, come on!
What, Lana, we must be talking...
Wholesale?
Uh, 50, 60 million?
LANAWholesale.
So, what, we form a cartel?
Well, how hard could it be?
I mean...
Don't.
...if Mexicans can do it.
$50 million, Lana.
We sell this and we're out.
I promise.
Dr. Krieger has devised a way to transport the cocaine undetected.
You're probably gonna want to try to minimize the sweating.
We're gonna go ahead and take the cocaine and the money.
What do you mean counterfeit?
The Yakuza?
Amphetamines?
!
Well, Pam screwed the Yakuza out of a million bucks of amphetamines, so now they're gonna cut her head off.
Baby, please don't go
Get down!
Baby, please don't go
Ron!
Yeah, this is actually a little harder than I thought.
Because I don't fly.
So, you've only got 24 hours to drive to Texas?
Did you tell anybody we were hauling a shitload of coke?
Yeah, your girl done gone down to the county farm
Take me with you!
Outlaw country!
Woooooo!
Honey, you're number 14 nationwide.
How bout a big ol' country welcome for Cherlene!
Before I be your dog get you way down here
Make you walk alone
Baby, please don't go
Woooooo!
Incredible.
I must meet this woman.
Well, what do you think is gonna happen when three gringos waltz in and start asking around for the woman who runs the entire Cali cartel?
Wooohooohooohoooo!
Are you sure you cannot make love to me just once more?
Not without a blood transfusion.
Very well.
Ow!
Ow!
Ow!
Baby, please don't go down to New Orleans
You know I love you so
Baby, please don't go
You're doing the exact thing you promised me you wouldn't!
I was kidding.
Before I be your dog
Before I be your dog
Welcome to San
Before I be your dog get you way down here
And let you walk alone
So, couple things.
Oh, goddamn it.
Did you fart in that?
You know how
I feel right now?
My baby's leaving
On that midnight train
And I'm crying
Suppressing fire!
Baby, please don't go
Goddamn it, Cyril!
Baby, please don't go
Baby, please don't go
You're running out of options, Archer.
Baby, please don't go
I want Archer dead!
Baby, please don't go down to New Orleans
You know I love you so
Baby, please don't go
I think you just stumbled backwards into a CIA arms deal.
They kidnapped Cherlene!
Archer!
We just started a frickin' coup!
Before I be your dog get you way down here
Make you walk alone
Baby, please don't go, yeah
Archer, my water just broke.
All right now.
And for what it's worth, I'm pretty sure
I just invaded Laos.
And, Chi, I swear to God, mention the compass again and just see what happens.
Archer Vice.
What?
Nothing.
Shut up.

Mawp.
Mawp.
Mawp!
Was that a flashbang?
- Sterling?
- Mawp?
Ow!
Do something.
What?
I brought roses.
- Jesus, Mother, it's just your birthday, not the...
- About that!
Oh.
Duh.
Archer!
Lana!
"Lana!" Ugh.
Not her birthday.
Ah!
No, move!
Get away from us!
Yeah, they're shooting at you!
Who?
The storm-ninjas!
What?
That's not a thing, idiot!
Oh.
I stand corrected.
Son of a...!
Bitches, I am pregnant!
Yes!
Who could forget?
With the bastard spawn of a total stranger.
Okay, first of all...
Cover your eyes and ears!
You're not the boss of me!
Meep?
Meep?
What's that, Beaker?
Oh, my God, is Beaker not the best?
Meep, meep, meep!
And wait, what's his, uh...
the name of...
Brett!
No, no, no, leave me alone!
Shut up.
Who's Beaker's boss?
What?
Beaker's boss.
- Goddamn it, I can't hear...
- Brett?
Well, he died doing what he loved.
Getting shot.
Meep.
Meep.
Archer!
Who the hell...
Shut up, it's on the tip of my tongue!
- What is?
!
- Beaker's boss!
What?
She meant who the hell are these guys, you big dumb idiot asshole!
Said the guy in a wheelchair!
What the...?
I just frickin' got here, Ray!
How the hell should I...
No...
- No, no, no, no, no, no...
- What, what're you...?
Oh.
Oh, boy.
FBI!
Nobody move!
FBI!
- Second worst birthday ever.
- What?
How is this better than your second fake 50th?
Oh, come on, guys, we talked about this!
You're supposed to yell "FBI" at the beginning.
After the flashbangs, but before Other Fat Mike gets shot.
Ow.
And what happened with getting "FBI"
on the fronts of the uniforms, huh?
- Ow!
- Huh?
Uh, what happened with since when the hell
- does the frickin' FBI get off...
- Sterling Archer?
Yes!
What?
!
I'm Special Agent in Charge Holly, and you are extremely under arrest.
For what?
Uh, in addition to the attempted murder of a federal agent?
Yes.
Well, there's gonna be just a whole bunch of charges, but mostly treason.
Treason?
What?
Archer, what'd you do?
No, no, not just him.
You, too, Miss Kane.
What?
!
Yeah.
Everybody.
Especially you, Ms. Archer.
Is this about the fake hydrogen bomb?
- Lana!
- No, but let's put a pin in that.
This is about conducting espionage operations, for years, with no authority or permission whatsoever, from the United States government.
Wait, what?
Mother!
Like, 50 times I asked you about that!
And like 50 times I lied.
Sue me.
I want my phone call.
Uh, sir?
It's like you said, he's dug in there like a tick, and...
Never!
You'll never take me alive!
- Okay, breach it.
- Roger that.
On second thought, I very much prefer to be taken alive.
Just let me clear the ol' browser history and...
No, no, no, no, no... oof!
Oh, come on!
Ooh, G-man-san.
I'm serious, you are not putting those on me.
Mr. Archer, please turn around and place your hands behind your back.
Or what?
What are you gonna do, taser...
Do me!
Do me!
Do me, do me, do me!
- I'm not tasering you, so just...
- Do me!
Thank you.
Ugh.
Our tax dollars hard at work.
Well, not mine, obviously, but...
What's that?
Damn it.
Whatever, Cyril.
I don't care who you are, when you get zapped with 50,000
- volts, it's like, like...
- Sploosh.
And then it's like wave after wave crashing over you, into you, and...
Will you shut up?
You shut up.
Let her talk.
- You shut up!
- Make me!
Ow!
Ow!
- Jesus!
- All of you.
Shut your various holes and listen to me very carefully.
- Why, so you can tell us more lies?
- Yeah.
So I can save you from life in prison!
Sorry, Ramona, I know to you it's just one big sexy briar patch, but...
- You know...
- Zip it!
That goes for all of you!
And when we get in there, you keep it zipped.
Because there's a chance I can make this all go away, but only if you people don't try to save your own necks by ratting out everyone else!
Damn it, trust me!
And say nothing!
You heard me, J. Edna.
Not one word.
Well, except for those three.
- And then those five.
And...
- Archer!
Then that one.
I really shouldn't say anything.
- I mean, unless you can guarantee me...
- Total immunity.
And I mean from everything.
Including anything you find on my computer.
Or in my crawlspace.
Oh, and throw a bone into me.
Excuse me?
I said Ms. Archer had an affair with the head of the KGB for, like, 30 years.
Yeah, until he got blown up.
Which was actually my fault.
Because she was busy having choke-sex with a murderous cyborg, who then became the new head of the KGB.
Until I built a sexier one out of illegal Soviet parts.
And a corpse.
There was no shortage of dead bodies around ISIS.
One of which belonged to the prime minister of goddamn Italy.
- Oh, Jesus, I forgot about the...
- Giant pot farm in West Virginia.
And this whole other thing with the Yakuza.
Irish Mob.
- Piracy.
- White slavery.
No, actual piracy.
With, like, boats.
I want to say...
Burt Reynolds?
- Poaching alligators...
- Smuggling Mexicans...
- Defiling a corpse...
- Defiling a different corpse...
Kidnapping the Pope...
Faking my own kidnapping!
Arson.
Bumfights!
- You know, like when you pay bums to...
- Destroy an oil pipeline in...
I want to say Burt Reynolds.
...Turkmenistan?
Odessa.
You know, the ratlines?
Where you make it look like a murder-suicide, but...
Is it murder if they were my own clones?
I'm seriously asking.
Oh, because, speaking of sexual assault...
Which time?
'Cause for one of 'em I got a pretty good excuse.
Can I stop you?
Please?
That's what he said.
Inappropriate.
Geez, when you just list everything ISIS has done, it sounds kind of bad.
- And so if I were you...
- You'd get laid a lot more?
I'd start talking.
Everybody else is!
They're in there right now, saying he's the brains behind ISIS.
- Ha!
- Exactly, I...
Hey, screw you!
Screw you!
Mr. My Mother's A Lying Bitch And I'm Too Stupid To Realize
My Life's A Pathetic Joke!
Oh, nice to meet you, Mrs. Hello My Kid's From A Sperm
Bank Since I Can't Keep A Man Because In Addition To My Jillion Neuroses
I Have A Weird-looking Vagina!
Okay, knock it off.
Hey!
I can't believe they fell for that.
Ahem.
Miss what?
Sorry, it-it's not that weird look...
Lana!
Thought you were gonna shoot me.
Day's not over.
And seriously, Lana, sorry for what I said.
Then that's where you say...
Good-bye, Archer.
Where do you think you're going?
Not to jail with you and your mother.
Well, you know, we can ask the judge...
You know prisons aren't co-ed, right?
Oh.
Okay, we got to get out of here.
"We"?
There is no "we" anymore, Archer!
Well, there's this we...
- Uh...
- Oh, shit.
Yeah.
You're gonna be a great mother.
I could start smoking crack today, and he'd still turn out better than you.
And why is that?
Because I never had a father, Lana?
So why don't you shut up, and then also marry me.
What?
!
I'm serious-- we can go underground, get new identities, and spend the rest of our lives together, Lana.
We'll be a family.
You, me, the baby and your not-that-weird-looking vagina.
Okay, don't take this the wrong way... but I would rather lose the baby.
Wha...
I...
Okay, that-that wasn't...
I didn't...
Excuse me.
Jesus Christ, come on, you idiot.
"I have read this statement, each page of which bears my initials, and I do hereby certify..."
"That the facts herein are true and correct, signed Pamela Poovey."
Cyril Figgis.
"Raymond Q. Gillette."
"Algernop Krieger."
"Cheryl and/or Carol Tunt."
Now, I would like a ride home, please.
Preferably in an Apache helicopter.
And I believe there was some mention of throwing a bone into me?
What are you talking about?
A penis in my vagina.
Or wherever, but come on, chop-chop, I got to go start enjoying my immunity.
Yeah, you said immunity.
I didn't.
Dukes!
God!
Damn it!
So is that a "no" on the Apache, or...?
Oh, my God, okay, so this ditz...
Oh.
Now who's the ditz, huh?
Would you just come on?
I'm seriously asking.
Aw, but look at him.
All tied up like a sexy little Christmas ham.
And can I just go on record as saying I think this is an extremely bad idea?
You know what's a bad idea?
Prison.
Because, spoiler alert, they're unisex.
Hello, best part.
Yeah?
Uh, uh...
Oh, Clyde?
Clyde, is that you?
It's me, dear, Mrs. J. Edgar Hoover's mother.
Um... it's open.
Ma'am.
Nobody move!
- Or...
- What the hell are you doing?
Getting us out of here.
I've already done that.
Let him go.
And you'll just have to put that on my...
whatever... crime tab.
No, no, no, no, no.
Taking a federal agent hostage is a separate charge.
Oh, well, then perhaps we should get him back on the phone.
I... that...
I-I don't...
There's no need to bother the...
Eh, look.
- If you'll just sign this form...
- Doo, doo, doo.
"In lieu of criminal prosecutions for..."
Doo, doo, doo... "Treason, I hereby forfeit ISIS headquarters.
And also agree to permanently cease and desist any and all ISIS operations."
Oh, my God.
Or face a mandatory sentence of life in federal prison without parole.
You got to be kidding me.
"Signed, Malory Archer."
Oh, my God.
No, uh-uh, nope.
Because correct me if I'm wrong, but that entire document is completely unenforceable.
I correct you.
You are wrong.
For God's sake, Sterling, it's the government.
Even if it weren't legal, they'd enforce it.
Hey, save it for four ninths of the Supreme Court.
Oh, shut up.
And unless there's anything else?
Uh, just this, releasing the bureau from any claims relating to the death of your employee...
Brett, uh, Bunson?
Oh, my God!
What?
Beaker's boss!
Bunsen frickin' Honeydew!
Woooooo!
That was figuratively killing me.
I can't believe they're taking our building.
Screw the building!
What about our jobs?
Oh, and our health insurance.
Which I'm pretty sure I'm gonna need.
I'll be your doctor.
Well, if I want Hitler's DNA spliced into him, I'll give you a call.
Yeah, I'm around.
Well, as for me, I think I'll start shopping my memoirs.
How does the title
Secrets and Silk grab you?
Tightly by my childhood's throat.
Oh, you're just jealous.
Yeah, jealous of my fallback career.
As what?
An actual acorn?
As America's number one country singer.
And kudos.
But for the rest of us trapped in the realm of possibility...
I'm gonna be bigger than Mac Davis.
And Mac Davis can totally suck it.
And you can all suck it because I am gonna play professional lacrosse.
Okay, even if that were a real thing...
Is it not?
...you are way too old.
I am not...
Oh, my God.
I am way too old.
Welp, hope I'm not too old to get back into underground fighting.
Darn.
All those jobs are awesome.
And by awesome you mean delusional.
Because it's gonna be hard to go back to an accounting firm after this job.
Especially after Mother gives you a shitty reference.
Mother, do that.
I meant it'll be boring.
Although, I guess I could always go back to being a defense attorney.
When were you ever a lawyer?
Lana, we had long talks about this.
How I went to night school to pass the CPA exam because I was so burned out defending scumbags as a public defender?
Numerous...
long talks.
With me?
Oh, for...
Well, don't come crying to me when that fatherless kid of yours buys a gun and steals a car, and he tries to run but he don't get far!
♪ In the ghetto where Mac Davis sucks it. ♪
Are you done?
Again, seriously asking.
Yes.
So I guess we should talk about the elephant in the room.
Namely...
What are we gonna do with literally, not figuratively, a ton of cocaine?
- Well...
- Wha...?
Oh, come on!
- What, Lana, we must be talking...
- Wholesale?
Uh, 50, 60 million?
Wholesale.
So, what, we form a cartel?
Well, how hard could it be?
I mean...
Don't.
...if Mexicans can do it.
$50 million, Lana.
We sell this and we're out.
I promise.
Dr. Krieger has devised a way to transport the cocaine undetected.
You're probably gonna want to try to minimize the sweating.
We're gonna go ahead and take the cocaine and the money.
What do you mean counterfeit?
The Yakuza?
Amphetamines?

Well, Pam screwed the Yakuza out of a million bucks of amphetamines, so now they're gonna cut her head off.

You, me, the baby, and your not-that-weird-looking vagina!
Okay, don't take this the wrong way, but I would rather lose the baby,
Uh...

Okay, that wasn't...
I didn't...

What the hell are you doing?
Getting us out of here!
I've already done that!
Let him go!
And you'll just have to put that on my, whatever, crime tab.
No, no, no, no, no, taking a federal agent hostage is a separate charge.
Oh.
Well, then perhaps we should get him back on the phone.

Bunsen frickin' Honeydew!
Whoo!
Oh!
Oh, that was figuratively killing me.

I can't believe they're taking our building.
Screw the building.
What about our jobs?
Oh.
And our health insurance,
Which I'm pretty sure I'm gonna need.
I'll be your doctor.
Well, if I want Hitler's DNA spliced into him, I'll give you a call.
Yeah, I'm around.
Well, as for me, I think I'll start shopping my memoirs,
How does the title Secrets and Silk grab you?
Tightly, by my childhood's throat,
Oh, you're just jealous.
Yeah, jealous of my fallback career,

As America's number one country singer!
And kudos, but for the rest of us, trapped in the realm of possibility...
I'm gonna be bigger than Mac Davis, and Mac Davis can totally suck it!
And you can all suck it, because I am gonna play professional lacrosse.
Okay, even if that were a real thing... ls it not?
...you are way too old.
I am not...
Oh, my God, I am way too old.
Welp, (KNUCKLES CRACKING) hope I'm not too old to get back into underground fighting.
Darn, all those jobs are awesome.
And by awesome, you mean delusional,
Because it's gonna be hard to go back to an accounting firm after this job.
Especially after Mother gives you a shitty reference,
Mother, do that.
I meant it'll be boring.
Although, I guess I could always go back lo being a defense attorney.

Lana, we had long talks about this.
How I wen!

Oh, for...
Well, don't come crying to me when that fatherless kid of yours buys a gun and steals a car, and he tries to run, but he don't get far!

Fifty, sixty million?
(LAUGHS) Wholesale.
So what, we form a cartel?
Well, how hard could it be?
I mean...
Don't!
If Mexicans can do it...
Fifty million dollars, Lana.
We sell this, and we're out.
I promise.
MALORY:
Dr. Krieger has devised a way to transport the cocaine undetected.
You're probably gonna want to try to minimize the sweating.
(WHIMPERING)
We are gonna go ahead and take the cocaine and the money.
What do you mean "counterfeit"?
ARCHER:
The Yakuza?
Amphetamines!
ARCHER:
Well, Pam screwed the Yakuza out of a million bucks of amphetamines.
So now they're gonna cut her head off, (SOBBING)

God damn it, Cyril!
You're running out of options, Archer!
I want Archer dead!
Baby, please don't go Down to New Orleans
You know I love you so Baby, please don't go

Excuse me?
GILLETTE:
I said Ms. Archer had an affair with the head of the KGB for, like, 30 years.
CHERYL/CAROL (laughs):
Yeah, until he got blown up.
Which was actually my fault.
CYRIL:
Because she was busy having choke-sex with a murderous cyborg, who then became the new head of the KGB.
KRIEGER:
Until I built a sexier one out of illegal Soviet parts.
And a corpse.
PAM:
There was no shortage of dead bodies around ISIS.
GILLETTE:
One of which belonged to the prime minister of goddamn Italy.
CYRIL:
Oh, Jesus, I forgot about the...
CHERYL/CAROL:
Giant pot farm in West Virginia.

KRIEGER:

You know, the ratlines?
CHERYL/CAROL:
Where you make it look like a murder-suicide, but...
KRIEGER:
Is it murder if they were my own clones?
I'm seriously asking.
GILLETTE:
Oh, because, speaking of sexual assault...
PAM (munching):
Which time?
'Cause for one of 'em I got a pretty good excuse.

Please?
PAM:

You're probably gonna want to try to minimize the sweating.
We're gonna go ahead and take the cocaine and the money.

Archer Vice.
LANA:
What?
ARCHER:
Nothing.
Shut up.
Mom.
Mom.
Was that a flashbang?
Sterling?
Mom?
Ow!
Do something!
What, I brought roses!
Jesus, Mother, it's just your birthday, not the...
About that!
Oh!
Duh.
Archer!
Lana!
"Lana." Ugh!
No!
her birthday.
No, move!
Get away from us!
Yeah, they're shooting at you!
Who?
The storm-ninjas!
What?
That's not a thing, idiot.
Oh.
I stand corrected,
Son of a...
Bitches, I am pregnant!
Yes, who could forget, with the bastard spawn of a total stranger.
Okay, first of all...
Cover your eyes and ears!
You're not the boss of me!
Meep.
Meep,
What's that, Beaker?
Oh, my God, is Beaker not the best?
Meep, meep. mew!
And wait, what's his, uh...
The name of...
Brett!
No, no, no!
Leave me alone!
Shut up.
Who's Beaker's boss?
What?
Beaker's boss,
God damn it, I can't hear...
Brett?
Well, he died doing what he loved.
Getting shot.
Archer!
Who the hell...
Shut up.
It's on the tip of my tongue!
What is?
Beaker's boss!
What?
She meant who the hell are these guys, you big, dumb idiot asshole!
Said the guy in a wheelchair!
What the...
- ARCHER:
I just frickin' got here, Ray!
How the hell should I...
No.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
What, what are you...
Oh.
Oh, boy.
FBI!
Nobody move!
FBI!
Second worst birthday ever.
What?
How is this better than your second fake 50th?
Oh, come on, guys, we talked about this!
You're supposed to yell "FBI" at the beginning.
After the flash bangs but before Other Fat Mike gets shot.
Ow!
And what happened with getting "FBI" on the fronts of the uniforms?
Huh?
Gun Huh?
Uh, what happened with "since when the hell does the frickin' FBI get off..."
Sterling Archer?
Yes!
What?
I'm Special Agent-In-Charge Holly, and you are extremely under arrest,
For what?
In addition to the attempted murder of a federal agent?
Yes?
Well, there's gonna be just a whole bunch of charges, but mostly treason,
Treason?
What?
Archer, what'd you do?
Oh, no, not just him.
You too, Miss Kane.
What?
Yeah.
Everybody.
Especially you, Ms, Archer.
Is this about the fake hydrogen bomb?
Lana!
No, but let's put a pin in that.
This is about conducting espionage operations for years with no authority or permission whatsoever from the United States government!
Wait, what?
Mother!
Like, 50 times I asked you about that!
And like, 50 times, I lied.
Sue me.
I want my phone call.
Sir?
It's like you said.
He's dug in there like a tick and...
Never!
You'll never take me alive!
Okay, breach it.
Roger that.
On second thought, I'd very much prefer to be taken alive!
Just let me clear the old browser history and...
No, no, no, no, no.
Come on!
Ooh!
G-man-san!
I'm serious.
You are not putting those on me.
Mr. Archer, please turn around and place your hands behind your back.
Or what?
What are you gonna do, taser...
Do me!
Do me!
Do me!
Do me!
Do me!
I'm not tasering you, so just...
Do me!
Thank you,
Ew!
Our tax dollars hard at work.
Well, not mine, obviously, but...
What's that?
Damn it.
Whatever, Cyril.
I don't care who you are.
When you get zapped with 50,000 volts, it's like, like...
Sploosh!
And then it's like, wave after wave crashing over you, into you, and...
Will you shut up?
You shut up.
Let her talk!
You shut up!
Make me!
Jesus!
All of you!
Shut your various holes and listen to me very carefully.
Why, so you can tell us more lies?
So I can save you from life in prison!
Sorry, Ramona, I know to you it's just one big, sexy briar-patch, but...
You know...
Zip it!
That goes for all of you!
And when we get in there, you keep it zipped!
Because there's a chance I can make this all go away, but only if you people don't try to save your own necks by ratting out everyone else!
Damn it, trust me!
And say nothing!
You heard me, J. Edna...
Not one word.
Well, except for those three.
And then those five, And...
Archer!
And that one.
I really shouldn't say anything.
I mean, unless you can guarantee me...
Total immunity.
And I mean from everything.
Including anything you find on my computer,
Or in my crawlspace.
Oh.
And throw a bone into me.
Excuse me?
I said Ms. Archer had an affair with the head of the KGB for, like, 30 years.
Yeah, until he got blown up,
Which was actually my fault.
Because she was busy having choke-sex with a murderous cyborg, who then became the new head of the KGB,
Until I built a sexier one out of illegal Soviet parts and a corpse.
There was no shortage of dead bodies around ISIS!
One of which belonged to the prime minister of goddamn Italy.
Oh, Jesus, I forgot about the...
Giant pol farm in West Virginia.
And this whole other thing with the Yakuza,
Irish mob, Piracy.
White slavery,
No, actual piracy, with like, boats.
I want to say Burt Reynolds-.
Poaching alligators.
Smuggling Mexicans.
Defiling a corpse.
Defiling a different corpse.
Kidnapping the Pope,
Faking my own kidnapping!
Arson.
Bumfights!
You know, like when you pay bums to...
Destroy an oil pipeline in...
I want lo say Bun Reynolds!
...Turkmenistan.
Odessa.
You know, the ratlines?
Where you make it look like a murder-suicide, but...
Is it murder if they were my own clones?
I'm seriously asking.
Oh.
Because speaking of sexual assault...
Which time?
Because for one of 'em, I've got a pretty good excuse,
Can I stop you?
Please?
That's what he said,
Inappropriate.
Geez, when you just list everything ISIS has done, it sounds kind of bad,
And so if I were you...
You'd get laid a lot more?
I'd start talking!
Everybody else is!
They're in there right now, saying he's the brains behind ISIS.
Ha!
Exactly, I...
Hey, screw you!
Screw you,
Mr, My Mother's a Lying Bitch, and I'm Too Stupid to Realize My Life's a Pathetic Joke!
Oh, nice lo meet you,
Mrs. Hello My Kid's From a Sperm Bank
Since I Can't Keep a Man
Because In Addition to My Jillion Neuroses,
I Have a Weird-Looking Vagina!
Okay, knock it off!
Hey!
I can'!
believe they fell for that.
Miss what?
Sorry.
It's not that weird.
Look...
Lana!
Thought you were gonna shoot me.
Day's not over,
And seriously, Lana, sorry for what I said.
Then that's where you say...
Ow!
Goodbye, Archer.
Where do you think you're going?
Not to jail with you and your mother!
Well, you know, we can ask the judge...
You know prisons aren't co-ed, right?
Oh.
Okay, we gotta get out of here,
We?
There is no we anymore, Archer!
Well, there's this we.
Uh...
Oh, shit.
Yeah, you're gonna be a great mother.
I could start smoking crack today, and he'd still turn out better than you!
And why is that?
Because I never had a father, Lana.
So why don't you shut up and then also marry me?
What?
I'm serious!
We can go underground, get new identities, and spend the rest of our lives together, Lana.
We'll be a family!
You, me, the baby, and your not-that-weird-looking vagina!
Okay, don't take this the wrong way, but I would rather lose the baby,
Uh...
Uh...
Okay, that wasn't...
I didn't...
Excuse me.
Jesus Christ, come on, you idiot,
"I have read this statement, each page of which bears my initials,
"and I do hereby certify..."
"...that the facts herein are true and correct, signed Pamela Poovey."
"Cyril Figgis."
"Raymond Q' Gillette."
"Algernop Krieger."
"Cheryl and/or Carol Tunt."
Now, I would like a ride home, please,
Preferably in an Apache helicopter,
And I believe there was some mention of throwing a bone into me?
What are you talking about?
A penis in my vagina.
Or wherever, but come on, chop-chop,
I gotta go start enjoying my immunity.
Yeah, you said immunity, I didn't'
Dukes!
God!
Damn it!
So is that a "no" on the Apache, or...
Oh, my God, okay, so this ditz...
Oh.
Now who's the ditz, huh?
Would you just come on?
I'm seriously asking!
Aw!
But look at him...
All lied up like a sexy little Christmas ham!
And can I just go on record as saying
I think this an extremely bad idea?
You know what's a bad idea?
Prison.
Because spoiler alert, they're unisex!
Hello, best part.
Yeah,
Oh, Clyde?
Clyde, is that you?
It's me, dear, Mrs. J. Edgar Hoover's mother!
Um...
It's open, ma'am.
Nobody move or...
What the hell are you doing?
Getting us out of here!
I've already done that!
Let him go!
And you'll just have to put that on my, whatever, crime tab.
No, no, no, no, no, taking a federal agent hostage is a separate charge.
Oh.
Well, then perhaps we should get him back on the phone.
I don't...
There's no need to bother the...
Look, if you'll just sign this form...
Doo-doo-doo,
"...in lieu of criminal prosecutions for doo-doo-doo treason,
"I hereby forfeit ISIS headquarters,
"and also agree to permanently cease and desist
"any and all ISIS operations..."
Or face a mandatory sentence of life in federal prison without parole!
"Signed, Malory Archer."
Oh, my God!
No!
Uh-uh!
Nope!
Because correct me if I'm wrong, but that entire document is completely unenforceable!
I correct you.
You are wrong,
For God's sake, Sterling, it's the government.
Even if it weren't legal, they'd enforce it.
Hey, save it for four-ninths of the Supreme Court.
Oh, shut up.
And unless there's anything else?
Uh, just this, releasing the Bureau from any claims relating to the death of your employee, Brett Bunsen?
Oh, my God!
What?
Beakers boss!
Bunsen frickin' Honeydew!
Whoo!
Oh!
Oh, that was figuratively killing me.
I can't believe they're taking our building.
Screw the building.
What about our jobs?
Oh.
And our health insurance,
Which I'm pretty sure I'm gonna need.
I'll be your doctor.
Well, if I want Hitler's DNA spliced into him, I'll give you a call.
Yeah, I'm around.
Well, as for me, I think I'll start shopping my memoirs,
How does the title Secrets and Silk grab you?
Tightly, by my childhood's throat,
Oh, you're just jealous.
Yeah, jealous of my fallback career,
As what, an actual acorn?
As America's number one country singer!
And kudos, but for the rest of us, trapped in the realm of possibility...
I'm gonna be bigger than Mac Davis, and Mac Davis can totally suck it!
And you can all suck it, because I am gonna play professional lacrosse.
Okay, even if that were a real thing...
Is it not?
...you are way too old.
I am not...
Oh, my God, I am way too old.
Welp, hope I'm not too old to get back into underground fighting.
Darn, all those jobs are awesome.
And by awesome, you mean delusional,
Because it's gonna be hard to go back to an accounting firm after this job.
Especially after Mother gives you a shitty reference,
Mother, do that.
I meant it'll be boring.
Although, I guess I could always go back lo being a defense attorney.
When were you ever a lawyer?
Lana, we had long talks about this.
How I wen!
to night school to pass the CPA exam because I was so burned out defending scumbags as a public defender?
Numerous long talks!
With me?
Oh, for...
Well, don't come crying to me when that fatherless kid of yours buys a gun and steals a car, and he tries to run, but he don't get far!
In the ghetto...
Where Mac Davis sucks it!
You done?
Are you done?
Again, seriously asking,
Yes.
So I guess we should talk about the elephant in the room,
Namely...
What are we gonna do with literally, not figuratively, a ton of cocaine.
Well...
Oh, come on!
What, Lana, we must be talking...
Wholesale?
Uh...
Fifty, sixty million?
Wholesale.
So what, we form a cartel?
Well, how hard could it be?
I mean...
Don't!
If Mexicans can do it...
Fifty million dollars, Lana.
We sell this, and we're out.
I promise.
Dr. Krieger has devised a way to transport the cocaine undetected.
You're probably gonna want to try to minimize the sweating.
We are gonna go ahead and take the cocaine and the money.
What do you mean "counterfeit"?
The Yakuza?
Amphetamines!
Well, Pam screwed the Yakuza out of a million bucks of amphetamines.
So now they're gonna cut her head off,
Baby, please don'!
go
Get down!
Baby, please don't go
Ron!
Yeah, this is actually a little harder than I thought.
Because I don't fly.

Previously on Californication:
Whoa, you have a surprisingly big dick.
Oh, but that doesn't make me want to be with you, Levon.
I'm not saying what he did is right.
But I get where he's coming from, you know?
He's a guy.
He just wants to get laid.
It's totally normal.
You have another family.
The bottom has just officially dropped out of our relationship.
Have you given any thought to taking on a manager?
I could see us working together.
Help me get the show out from under Rath, and I'm yours.
There is nothing limp-dick about you, Charlie.
I mean, she's so beautiful.
Is it cool if I pursue her?
You're not looking to rekindle?
- No, no, not at all.
- Why not?
- This is a terrible idea.
- It's a terrible idea.
Hey, you rang?
- Yeah, how's that outline going?
- Not great.
It's kind of like having an impacted bowel and you're forced to stick your finger up your ass and pry the shit out one dry, flaky chunk at a time, except with words.
- Thank you for that.
- You're welcome.
Didn't know you played.
- Just enough to know how much I suck.
- Copy that, motherfucker.
I am going out on a date with Julia tonight.
Oh, the real reason you summoned me.
Maybe.
You okay with that?
If the lady's cool with it, I'm cool with it.
The kid?
Think he'll be cool with it?
- I thought you didn't care.
- You wanted to see me, Mr. Rath, sir?
Yeah, hey, come in, come in.
Have a seat.
- How you doing, buddy?
- Couldn't be better.
- Good.
- Want some chocolate?
No, thank you.
Listen, I wanted you to know that I'm taking your mom out tonight.
- Hank supports it.
- Yeah, I know all about it.
- What, she told you?
- Yeah, we tell each other everything.
- E*verything?
- Pretty much, yeah.
One time my Aunt Jesse stayed with us for a few days.
It was around the time I started jerking off.
She leaves a pair of panties behind.
I'd sniff them while I hit it.
Really enhanced the orgasm, you know?
Then I started to feel weird and guilty about it.
So I told my mom.
She was so fucking cool about it.
She was pretty hot for an aunt, though, Aunt Jesse.
- Maybe I should rethink this thing.
- Oh, no, no, don't.
Look, my mom's a great lady.
She deserves to have fun with men.
Gross.
Just be cool, okay?
Anyone can be a dick.
Be a gentleman.
Think about it like I was dating your mom.
I don't want to think about like that.
My mom is dead.
Oh, my God, I am so sorry.
I had no idea.
- Was she hot?
- Holy shit.
Hey, you know, the good news here is I'm totally free to hang tonight.
What do you want to do?
So who recommended you?
Mommy, why are you hurting that lady's "bagina"?
Stuart, I told you to stay in your room.
Mommy's working.
It's okay, honey.
She's not hurting it.
I mean, it hurts a little bit.
Actually, it hurts a lot.
But she's just taking the hair off.
- He doesn't need to...
- Why are you taking the hair off?
- Stuart...
- Because boys like the way it looks.
Honey, I need you to go back to your room now.
I don't like it.
It looks like a big pink walnut.
All right, then, run along now.
He is so cute.
Yes, he is a little dolly.
Just like his dad.
It's weird.
Okay, so who recommended you?
- Stu Beggs.
- Oh, okay, my ex.
Yeah, he said that you probably needed the work.
He said that your husband isn't much of an earner, so...
I'm sure he did.
And no, he is not.
He talks about you a lot, actually.
I think that he's still in love with you.
Well, actually, he has said that out loud, like, a lot.
Wait, so how do you guys know each other?
- He's a client.
- Oh, okay.
So, what are you, like, a publicist or something?
- More like...
- A hooker?
- Yeah, pretty much.
- Yeah, that's real neat.
- Sorry.
- No, it's fine.
No judgment.
So, Stu's big into prostitutes these days.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah, he must be nursing a broken heart or something because he drops a lot of cash on 'tutes.
I like to think that I'm his favorite, but he's not really very picky.
I'll tell you what, though.
He calls me Marcy when we bone.
Good to know.
Cheers.
Shit.
Jesus Christ, that tastes awful.
- Drink up.
It'll put hair on your balls.
- I've got too much hair on my balls.
You see this fucking mop?
Now picture my balls.
This is a house where the carpet definitely matches the drapes.
That's not how you use that phrase.
- It's not?
- No.
You've really never had a serious girlfriend?
Well, not really.
I mean, I've had my fair share of texting relationships.
But they always end with me saying something really inappropriate and then the girl goes silent and then I end up texting her more and her parents call my mom I get a talking-to about cyberbullying.
It's a real fucking bummer.
Yeah, you need to start dealing with some real live women, one-on-one.
That's fucking scary.
Yeah, but still...
- Here's your shot.
- You sure?
Go forth.
Hi.
Hi, pretty lady.
Do you want to have a drink with me and my dad?
We recently started a relationship with each other.
Hey, I know you.
- Dude, did you bang her?
- Shut up.
Really?
Where from?
- I was your student.
- Oh, yeah.
- I took your writing class.
- That's right.
I taught for a while.
I totally forgot about that.
How was I?
Honestly, I've had better.
Honestly, I've been better.
That was a dark time.
But allow me to make it up to you by introducing you to a promising young actor on the rise Levon.
- Cool.
What have you been in?
Not much of anything, really.
I mean, sometimes I film myself doing famous movie monologues and I put them on YouTube.
I figure someone will...
Oh, he's being modest.
He's working on a new show called Santa Monica Cop.
I'm just a PA, really.
I get lunches and shit.
Cool.
Hey, you were sleeping with that girl who turned out to be a stripper, right?
What?
That is silly.
Teachers sleeping with students.
That's not cool.
No, it was a really big deal.
Didn't you fuck that TA too?
And the dean's wife?
You were famous that semester.
You fucked them all.
Hey, could I get a picture with you?
My friend is gonna lose her shit.
Would you mind?
Thanks, Dad.
One, two, three.
Goldie?
You in there?
What fucking took you so long, Runkle?
I came as soon as you called.
Are you okay?
Have you been drinking?
Obviously.
- Maybe this is a mistake.
- What?
What?
Why?
Why?
What are you talking about?
I need a manager who cares about me as much as about what me can do for him.
I do, Goldie, very much so.
What can I do for you?
How can I help?
Get me off this fucking show.
- Why?
- Rath humiliated me.
What did he do?
Did he hit on you?
No, he would never do that.
I'm sure he thinks I'm an unfuckable monster.
Oh, I don't think that's true at all.
Thank you, Charlie.
You make me feel really sexy.
Oh, I didn't mean to do that, exactly.
But good, I guess.
So, what did Rath do?
He fucking rewrote my script.
Well, isn't that, you know, par for the course in television?
E*very single fucking line?
You mean to tell me I didn't write one usable word?
Not even a fucking preposition or two.
Okay, okay, okay.
So, what would you like me to do, Goldie?
- Would you want me to?
- Have him killed.
Have him killed.
Okay.
What do you say we put a pin in that one for now, just for now and we look at that as a you know, last-resort situation?
You know, the very least you could fucking do is call him and rip him a new asshole so that he knows I can't be treated like some girl from the street.
I'm a world-class writer and producer and I'm gonna have my own show one day if that means giving up every ounce of personal happiness to get it.
I will talk to him.
- Promise?
- I promise.
Will you drive me home?
- Sure thing, Goldie.
- Okay.
- Let's go.
- One more drink.
He's a little monster.
- I'm gonna get you.
- I'm gonna get you!
Oh, my God.
This is the best play date Stuart's ever had.
They do have chemistry, that's for sure.
- He seems like a good kid.
- He is, he is.
- I just wish I could get him laid.
- Can you get me laid?
Maybe we can kill two pervs with one stone.
You deflower him.
It's a win-win.
Listen, I'm horny as fuck these days but I don't think that kid will last long enough for Mommy to get hers.
Maybe he needs professional help.
- What, like a therapist?
- Yeah, or a...
- Like a hooker?
- Yeah.
Hank, I waxed a hooker today.
She was young, cute, and totally down to fuck.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Probably spendy.
- It's only money, right?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
That kid would love you forever if you bust his hymen like that.
Chick was fucking bananas hot.
This sounds too good to be true.
Let's hold on a second.
Wait, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Is this wrong?
I can't tell anymore.
- I can't fucking tell anymore.
- Me, neither.
- Let me see if she's available.
- Good idea.
- Hello, again.
- Hi.
Thanks for the rip this morning.
My pussy looks fantastic.
It really does.
I mean, great job.
You could eat off the fucking thing.
- Thank you, and you are?
- Jim.
Nice to meet you, sweetie.
- Nice to meet you too.
- Is this him?
No.
No, sorry.
Hey, you're not supposed to get excited about the fucking johns.
- Sorry, he's a really good-Iooking guy.
- You must be the pimp.
What is this, like a fucking Blaxploitation movie?
I mean, we don't really use that terminology anymore.
Yeah, I'm more like her manager, the guy you hand the money to like right now.
- Oh, yeah.
Sure, sure, sure.
So how does it work?
What's the split?
My guy gets 15 percent and his pimp hand is not strong at all.
Are you the Better Business Bureau?
Don't worry about it.
Where's this dude she's gonna fuck?
- Hey, guys.
- Karen, hello.
- Hi!
- Karen!
Hey, hey, hey.
Why don't you get your guests a drink?
- Yes, I'm gonna do it.
- Hi, what are you doing here?
- Well, you've been ducking my calls.
- I know, I know.
Okay, so, I want to talk to you about Becca.
- I know, that's why I'm ducking you.
- Well, why?
When are you gonna tell her about Levon?
- When is she back?
- In a few weeks.
- In a few weeks, then.
- Well, Hank she wants to know why you're ducking her calls too.
I'm not gonna talk to her on the phone about this shit.
And in fact, when I do it, I think we should do it together, you and I.
- No.
You see...
- Yeah.
- No, no, no.
I knew...
- What?
I am not gonna get involved in your dysfunctional shit, okay?
- What...?
What are you...?
What is this?
- What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Marcy invited some of her waxing clients over.
- Isn't that right, Marcy?
- Yeah.
I'm having a client over for a drink.
Okay, well, how come she's here so late and dressed so slutty?
- Maybe she's gonna get a facial.
- Right.
Really?
Does she always travel with sex toys?
You know, some people are not so averse to rubberized help.
That's true.
Yay, mission accomplished.
Little Stuart is officially asleep.
We read books, played the tickle game.
- He loves the tickle game.
- I know.
I taught him how to Dutch oven.
He loved it.
Kid loves farts.
Oh, you did good.
- Thanks.
- Is this him?
- Who's him?
Who am I?
Who are you?
- You know what?
Let's get this fucking party started.
We got another appointment later.
Kid, you gotta wear a rubber.
Okay?
Anything off the menu has to be approved by me.
I mean, she's pretty open, as you can see.
But scat play, definitely out of the question.
Oh, my God.
- You got him a hooker.
- Karen, that is ridiculous.
Marcy was kind enough to set Levon up with one of her clients.
- One of your clients?
Oh, really?
- I'm setting him up with her.
Look what a cute couple they'd make.
- Adorable.
- Marcy, is your client a hooker?
Who knows what she does for a living?
That's personal.
Shut up.
Is your client a hooker?
- Maybe.
- Marcy.
Hey, I am happy to help you try to bust your weirdo kid's cherry but I will not lie to my best friend.
Oh, my God.
This is so fucking depraved.
No, it's not.
I'm performing a service here.
This kid's...
He needs to clear this hurdle.
He's wired and pent-up.
Gotta get the poison out.
- That's what Stu always says.
- It's true.
Once you get that shit out, you can think clearly again.
You got me a fucking hooker?
- Maybe.
- Oh, my God.
Thank you so much.
This is exactly what I thought having a father would be like.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
I'm sorry.
No.
No, no, no.
I know this is, like, absolutely nothing to do with me but I feel that someone here should be representing your mom's interest.
- Why?
That's fucking weird.
- No, no, no.
Because she would not want you to lose your virginity like this.
Oh, my God, you told her I'm a virgin?
- No.
- That's embarrassing, dude.
No offense, but you don't present as a guy who's knee-deep in pussy.
Yet it's all I ever think about.
Okay, so the first time, it should be special, right?
And it should be someone you care about, someone you love you like, at least, like.
Right?
- I completely agree and I could easily see myself falling in love with her.
I totally like her now.
See what she's wearing?
I do, yeah.
But it's not something that you would want to pay for.
I'm not paying.
I haven't even got a paycheck yet.
There's forms I'm supposed to fill out.
Actually, can you help me out with that?
Money's taken care of.
That's no problem.
- I fucking love you, Dad.
- I fucking love you too, buddy.
No, no, no.
Stop it, stop it.
Look, Levon, Levon, I know this is very confusing for you.
I get that.
L...
Okay, take a moment.
Just take a moment.
Just:
Just, yeah, breathe.
Yeah, okay.
Now think about your mother.
Gross.
That's the last thing I want to think about.
No, about what she would say.
Creepy Cosby family, we gonna do this?
It's up to you.
But there's no fucking refunds here.
If you want credit, it's a 25 percent restocking fee.
- That's fucking steep, bro.
- It's a seller's market, dude.
- Hold on.
Karen.
- Yes?
- Yes?
- Do you want to fuck me?
- No.
- Oh, my God.
- What is wrong with you?
Did you...?
- I didn't raise him.
The only person willing to fuck me is the one getting paid.
I think I'm okay with that.
You know, in fact, I'm more than okay with that.
I'm super fucking psyched.
- I'm doing this.
- Okay.
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah?
The clit's on top, right?
Last I checked, yeah.
Okay.
There you go, you lean there.
I'll get the door.
Good job.
Okay.
Here we go.
Hey, what are you doing?
I'm driving you home.
Oh, no.
No, not in your car.
In my car.
How am I supposed to get to work tomorrow?
Well, how am I gonna get home tonight?
I don't give a fuck.
That's your problem.
You can take a fucking rickshaw, for all I care.
No, you take me home.
You walk me in.
You make sure that I am safe.
And then you need to position me so that I don't choke on my own vomit.
Okay, okay.
If that's what you need, sure.
Hold on, that's not a good idea because then you're gonna get in my house.
You'll want to take advantage of me in my inebriated state.
I would never do something like that.
I'm not hot enough to take advantage of?
No, no, you're plenty hot, Goldie.
You're crazy hot.
Thank you.
I appreciate it.
Thank you for taking care of me tonight...
You know what?
That's just what I do, okay?
That's a full-service management, all right?
Curb to curb.
You know if someone would've told me that I was gonna be represented one day by the masturbating agent I would've just shit my panties.
Will wonders never cease?
Can I ask you something?
What made you want to throw it all away for a couple of random jerk-off sessions?
I guess it's just the very same thing that makes me such a great representative.
I'm ready to burn it all down at a moment's notice.
Oh, "burn it all down." I like that.
"Burn it all down." I'm gonna get that in a tattoo on my bikini line.
- We should get tattoos.
Let's go.
- No, no.
You never get a tattoo under the influence.
That's how you wind up with a butterfly tramp stamp.
- You're funny.
- Okay, yeah.
- You're funny.
Really funny.
- Okay.
Give me a hug.
You know, I could feel you getting hard last week when we were hugging.
I'm sorry about that.
You're getting hard right now, aren't you?
Why does this keep happening to me?
Oh, shit.
I don't feel so good.
Okay...
- It's okay.
- Okay.
Sorry.
I think I'm allergic to sulfites.
So sorry.
It's all over your crotch.
My first time wasn't special at all.
Dude kissed me a couple of times paid zero attention to my tits licked me twice, stuck it in once panicked, pulled out, and shot a load all over my thigh.
It was fun stuff.
Well, at least it got you prepared for Papa Runks.
What was your first time like, pretty lady?
Shut up.
You looking to make any extra money?
I could turn you out, no problem.
You're a feisty one, I like that.
Nice.
Karen.
- Karen, I'm sorry about that.
- You know, I don't know what's worse.
What's going on here tonight, which is absolutely disgusting or that I don't know who you are anymore.
That's not fair.
If we had a son we'd most probably be having the same conversation and I would probably feel exactly the same way.
If we had a son, I would never, ever let you do something like this.
Karen, it's just sex.
What's the big deal?
But it's not just sex.
That's the whole point.
You're teaching him to degrade and objectify women that they exist solely to satisfy his urges when you could, in fact, be teaching him that the best kind of sex comes from making a connection.
I agree with you.
I do.
It's just, there are all different types of sex to be had.
And who says he has to make sweet love his very first time out the gate?
- Hi.
Hank, is it?
- Yeah.
Could you come in here for a second?
Hey, it's more for a threesome.
Just saying.
- What's up?
- I think your boy's a little nervous.
- It's totally understandable.
- I asked him to unwrap my dress and then he almost passed out.
I'm dizzy, Hank.
I'm shaking like a leaf, man.
Is it possible I'm having a heart attack?
Here, feel.
Maybe there's a medical condition or something I don't know about.
- Maybe I should go see a doctor.
- Maybe we made a mistake here.
Maybe Karen's right.
Maybe this isn't the way it's supposed to go down.
Maybe I'm supposed to meet a nice girl and somehow sweet-talk her into letting me foul her.
You don't have to go through with this, you know, not at all.
- You wouldn't be disappointed in me?
- No way.
Never.
God, I'm so fucking lame, and you're such a fucking baller.
You are not lame in the slightest.
You're a bright, interesting kid and got a shitload of love in your heart.
- I do.
- You've made the past few weeks of my life very interesting.
I'm happy to know you.
- Thanks, Dad.
- All right.
Oh, guys.
This is maybe one of the sweetest fucking things I've ever seen.
But I have another appointment.
If we're not doing this then I'm gonna grab my double-sided dildo and I'm just gonna go.
What do you think?
- What do you think?
- What do you think?
- I don't know.
- Here's what I think.
That's what she thinks.
So, what's it gonna be?
Get the fuck out of here, okay?
Gone.
Oh, if you find yourself getting too excited think about your grandfather emptying his colostomy bag.
Works like a charm.
Trust.
Hey.
What's going on?
Well, Levon is losing his virginity to a hooker in the guest room right now.
Good for him.
Good for him.
- Who are you?
- He's the pimp.
Jesus Christ.
I handle the fucking money, and I keep her safe from creeps.
Don't be such a condescending prick.
- He's the pimp.
- Did you piss your pants or something?
Done deal.
Another happy customer.
Kid's got a sick fucking hog on him, by the way.
Hey, you're not supposed to get excited about their cocks.
Well, what?
Some of them are better and nicer than others.
That's a fact.
I had such a fun time, sweetie.
Call me anytime.
Tweet me, whatever.
- I will, definitely.
- You definitely will not.
- That shit's expensive.
- Well, we offer a frequent flyer discount.
Peace out, weirdoes.
- Bye, you honey.
- Bye, Marcy.
Thank you.
Take me to bed, Runks.
I haven't been laid in so long I'm starting to feel like a born-again virgin.
I'm not feeling very amorous, Marcy.
My new client puked into my crotch tonight.
- Yeah, I can smell it.
- Have a seat, Harpo.
Oh, man.
- How you feeling?
- Amazing.
Amazing.
It's like my head is so fucking clear right now, you know?
I feel like I understand the relationship between shit in the universe a lot better.
I feel like I could solve the world's bigger problems.
- You got the poison out.
- Yes, exactly.
- Yeah.
- How long is this feeling going to last?
- About six or seven minutes.
- Shit.
Better enjoy it, then.
Oh, hey, that thing with my Grandpa and the colostomy bag totally worked.
How'd you know he had a bag?
- What?
- You said you tell your mother everything.
- Are you gonna tell her about this?
- No.
No fucking way.
Karen was right.
She would be totally pissed and think it was all fucking gross and misogynistic and shit.
- Okay, that's good to know.
- Yeah.
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah?
Thanks again.
This was truly an epic fucking night in my life and I will never ever forget...
- You're welcome, you're welcome.
It's a wet one.
You'd better get me a kick-ass Father's Day gift.
You know I will.
In fact, I'm gonna book you some time with Nikki.
She did this thing with her vagina.
It was talking to my dick.
That's too much.
Smell my fingers.
- Go to bed.
- Okay.
Ripped By mstoll
Previously on Californication...
Whoa!
You have a surprisingly big dick.
Oh, but that doesn't make me want to be with you, Levon.
I'm not saying what he did is right.
But I get where he's coming from, you know?
He's a guy.
He just wants to get laid.
It's totally normal.
You have another family.
The bottom has just officially dropped out of our relationship!
Have you ever given any thought to taking on a manager?
I could totally see us working together.
You help me get the show out from under Rath, and I'm all yours.
There is nothing limp dick about you, Charlie.
I mean, she's so beautiful.
Is it cool if, uh, I pursue her?
- You're not looking to rekindle?
- No.
- No, not at all.
- Why not?
- This is...
- It's a terrible idea.
a terrible idea.
[Guitar playing]
Hey!
You rang?
Yeah.
How's that outline going?
Not great.
It's kind of like having an impacted bowel and you're forced to stick your finger up your ass and pry the shit out one dry, flaky chunk at a time, except with words.
- Thank you for that.
- You're welcome.
Didn't know you played.
Just enough to know how much I suck.
Copy that, motherfucker.
Um, I am going out on a date with Julia tonight.
Oh.
The real reason you summoned me.
Maybe.
You okay with that?
If the lady's cool with it, I'm cool with it.
What about the kid?
You think he'll be cool with it?
I thought you didn't care about such things.
You wanted to see me, Mr. Rath, sir?
Yeah, hey!
Come in, come in.
Have a seat.
- How you doing, buddy?
- Couldn't be better.
- Good.
- Want some chocolate?
No, thank you.
Listen...
Uh, I wanted you to know that, uh, I'm taking your mom out tonight.
- Hank supports it.
- Yeah, I-I know all about it.
- What, she told you?
- Yeah.
We tell each other everything.
Everything?
Pretty much, yeah.
One time, my Aunt Jesse stayed with us for a few days, and it was right around the time I started jerking off.
So she leaves a pair of her panties behind.
I used to sniff 'em while I hit it.
Really enhanced the orgasm, you know?
Then I started to feel, like, weird and guilty about it, so I told my mom.
She was so fucking cool about it.
She's pretty hot for an aunt, Aunt Jesse.
Maybe I should rethink this thing.
Oh, no, no.
Don't.
Look, look, my mom's a great lady.
She... she deserves to have fun with men.
Gross.
J-just be cool, okay?
Anyone can be a dick.
Be a gentleman, you know?
Think about it like if I was gonna date your mom.
I don't want to think about it like that.
My mom is dead.
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I had no idea.
Was she hot?
Holy shit.
Hey, you know, the... the good news here is I'm totally free to hang tonight.
What do you want to do?

♪
So who recommended you?
Mommy!
Why are you hurting that lady's "Bagina"?
Stuart, I told you to stay your room.
Mommy's working.
It's okay, honey.
She's not hurting it.
I mean, it hurts a little bit.
Actually, it hurts a lot.
But she's just taking the hair off.
Okay, yeah, he doesn't need to...
Why are you taking the hair off?
Stuart...
Because boys like the way it looks.
Honey, I need you to go back to your room now.
I don't like it at all.
It looks like a big pink walnut.
All right, then, run along now.
Wow.
He is so cute. [Chuckles]
Yes.
He is a little dolly... just like his dad.
It's weird.
Okay, so who recommended you?
Stu Beggs.
Oh, okay, my ex.
Yeah.
He said that you probably needed the work.
He said that your husband isn't much of an earner, so...
I'm sure he did.
And, no, he is not.
He talks about you a lot, actually.
I think that he's still in love with you.
Well, actually, he has said that out loud, like, a lot.
[Laughs]
Wait.
So how do you guys know each other?
- He's a client.
- Oh, okay.
So what are you, like, a publicist or something?
- More like...
- A hooker?
- Yeah.
- Yeah!
- Pretty much.
- That's real neat.
Sorry.
No, it's fine.
No judgment.
So, uh, Stu's big into prostitutes these days.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah, he must be nursing a broken heart or something because he drops a lot of cash on 'tutes.
I like to think that I'm his favorite, but he's not really very picky.
- Hmm.
- I'll tell you what, though.
He calls me Marcy when we bone.
- [Laughs]
- Oh!
Good to know. [Slapping]
♪ I wish I could meet Elvis ♪

Cheers.
Shit!
Jesus Christ, that tastes awful.
Drink up, Nancy.
It'll put hair on your balls.
I've got too much hair on my balls.
You see this fucking mop?
Now picture my balls.
This is a house where the carpet definitely matches the drapes.
Yeah, that's not how you use that phrase.
- It's not?
- No.
Oh.
You've really never had a serious girlfriend.
Well, not really.
I mean, I've had my fair share of texting relationships, but they always end with me saying something really inappropriate, and then the girl goes silent, and then I end up texting her a hundred more times,
and her parents call my mom, and I get a serious talking-to about cyberbullying.
It's... it's a real fucking bummer.
Yeah, you need to start dealing with some real live women one-on-one.
Ooh, that is fucking scary.
Yeah, but still...
Oh.
- Here's your shot.
- You sure?
- Go forth.
- [Ahem].
- Oh!
- Hi.
Uh, hi, pr... pretty lady.
Um...
Do... do you... do you want to have a drink with me and my dad?
We just recently started a relationship with each other.
Hey, I know you.
- Dude, did you bang her?
- Shh.
Shut up.
Really?
Where from?
- I was your student.
- Oh, yeah.
I took your writing class.
That's right.
I taught for a while.
I totally forgot about that.
How was I?
Honestly, I've had better.
Honestly, I've been better.
That was a dark time.
But allow me to make it up to you by introducing you to a promising young actor on the rise...
- Oh.
- Levon.
Cool.
What have you been in?
Not... not much of anything, really.
I mean, sometimes I film myself doing famous movie monologues, and I put them on YouTube.
I figure someone will eventually...
Oh, he's being modest.
He's working on a new show called Santa Monica Cop.
I-I'm just a PA, really.
I-I get lunches and shit.
Cool.
Hey, you were sleeping with that girl who turned out to be a stripper, right?
What?
That is silly.
Teachers sleeping with students... that's not cool.
No, it was a really big deal.
Didn't you fuck that TA too and the dean's wife?
[Laughs]
You were famous that semester.
You fucked them all.
- Wow.
- Hey... could I get a picture with you?
My friend is gonna lose her shit.
Would you mind?
Thanks, Dad.
One, two, three.
Goldie?
You in there?
What fucking took you so long, Runkle?
I came as soon as you called.
Are you okay?
- Have you been drinking?
- Obviously.
- Maybe this is a mistake.
- What?
What?
Why?
What... what are you talking about?
I need a manager who cares about me as much as about what me can do for him.
I do, Goldie, very much so.
What can I do for you?
- How can I help?
- Get me off this fucking show.
Why?
Rath humiliated me.
Ah.
What did he do?
Did he hit on you?
No!
He would never do that.
I'm sure he thinks I'm an unfuckable monster.
Oh, I don't think that's true at all.
Thank you, Charlie.
[Crunching]
You make me feel really sexy.
Oh, I-I didn't mean to do that exactly.
But good, I guess.
So what did Rath do?
He fucking rewrote my script.
[Scoffs] Oh, well, isn't that, you know, par for the course in television?
Every single fucking line?
You mean to tell me I didn't write one usable word?
Not even a fucking preposition or two.
Okay, okay, okay.
So what would you like me to do, Goldie?
Would you... would you want me to, um...
Have him killed.
Have him killed.
Okay.
Uh, what do you say we put a pin in that one, hmm... for now, just for now... and we look at that as a, um... you know, last-resort situation?
You know, the very least you could fucking do is call him and rip him a new asshole so that he knows I can't be treated like some girl from the street, okay?
I'm a world-class writer and producer, and I'm gonna have my own show one day, if that means giving up every ounce of personal happiness to get it.
I will talk to him.
- Promise?
- I promise.
Will you drive me home?
- Sure thing, Goldie.
- Okay.
- Let's go.
- One more drink.
- Aah!
Raah!
- He's a little monster!
I'm gonna getcha, I'm gonna getcha,
- I'm gonna getcha!
- I'm gonna get you!
Oh, my God.
This is the best playdate Stuart's ever had.
They do have chemistry, that's for sure.
- He seems like a good kid.
- He is, he is.
I just wish I could get him laid.
Can you get me laid?
Maybe we can kill two pervs with one stone.
You deflower him.
It's a win-win.
Listen, I'm horny as fuck these days, but seriously, I don't think that kid's gonna last long enough for mommy to get hers.
Maybe he needs professional help.
What, like a therapist?
Yeah, or a...
[Clicking tongue]
- Like a hooker?
- Yeah.
Hank, I waxed a hooker today.
She was young and cute and totally down to fuck.
- Really?
- Yeah.
[Stu grunting]
- Probably spendy.
- It's only money, right?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
That kid would love you forever if you bust his hymen like that.
Chick was fucking bananas hot!
This sounds too good to be true.
- Let's just hold on a second.
- Okay.
Just wait, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Is this wrong?
I can't tell anymore.
I can't fucking tell anymore.
Me neither.
[Laughing]
- Let me see if she's available.
- Good idea.
- Hello, again.
- Hi.
Thanks for the rip this morning.
My pussy looks fantastic.
It really does.
I mean, great job!
You could eat off the fucking thing.
Thank you.
And you are?
Jim.
Nice to meet you, sweetie.
Oh.
Nice to meet you too.
Is this him?
No!
Ha ha!
No, sorry.
Hey, you're not supposed to get excited about the fucking Johns here.
Sorry.
He's a really good-looking guy.
You must be the pimp.
What is this, like a fucking blaxploitation movie?
I mean, we don't really use that terminology anymore.
Oh.
Yeah, I'm more like her manager, the guy that you hand the money to...
- Okay.
- Like, right now.
Oh, oh, yeah.
Sure, sure, sure.
So how does it work?
What's the split?
My guy gets 15%, and his pimp hand is not strong at all.
What are you, the Better Business Bureau?
Don't worry about it.
Where's this dude she's gonna fuck?
- Hey, guys.
- Hi!
- Karen, hello.
- Hi!
- Hi!
- Karen!
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Why don't you get your guests a drink or something?
- Yes, I'm gonna do it.
- What are you doing here?
Um, well, you've been ducking my calls.
I know, I know, I know.
Okay, so I want to talk to you about Becca.
I know.
That's why I'm ducking you.
Well, why?
I mean, when are you gonna tell her about Levon?
- When is she getting back?
- In a few weeks.
- In a few weeks, then.
- Well, Hank, she wants to know why you're ducking her calls too.
Karen, I'm not gonna talk to her on the phone about this shit, okay?
And in fact, when I do it,
I think we should do it together, you and I.
- No!
- Yeah.
No, no, no.
I knew...
I am not gonna get involved in your dysfunctional shit, okay?
What is... what are you hi... what is this?
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Who is this?
Marcy invited some waxing clients over.
- Isn't that right, Marcy?
- Yeah, yeah.
I'm having a client over for a drink.
Okay, well, um, how come she's here so late and dressed so slutty?
Maybe she's gonna get a facial.
Right.
Really?
Does she always travel with...
[Whispering] sex toys?
You know, some people are not so averse
- to, uh, rubberized help.
- That's true.
Yay!
Mission accomplished.
Little Stuart is officially asleep.
We read books.
We played the tickle game.
He loves the tickle game!
I know.
I also taught him how to dutch oven.
He loved it.
Kid loves farts.
Ooh, you did good.
- Thanks.
- Is this him?
Who... who's him?
Who am I?
- Who are you?
- You know what?
Let's get this fucking party started, all right?
We got another appointment later.
Okay, kid, you got to wear a rubber, okay?
Anything off the menu has to be approved by me.
I mean, she's pretty open, as you can see, but scat play... definitely out of the question.
Oh, my God.
You got him a hooker.
Karen, that is ridiculous.
Marcy was kind enough to set Levon up
- with one of her clients.
- One of your clients?
I'm...
I'm...
I'm setting him up with her.
Look at what a cute couple they would make, adorable.
Marcy... is your client a hooker?
Who knows what she does for a living, Karen?
- That's personal.
- Shut up.
Is your client a hooker?
- Maybe.
- Marcy!
Hey!
I am happy to help you try to bust your weirdo kid's cherry, but I will not lie to my best friend.
Oh, my God.
This is so fucking depraved.
No, it's not.
I-I'm performing a service here.
This kid's... he needs to clear this hurdle.
He's all wired and pent-up.
He's got to get the poison out.
- That's what Stu always says.
- It's true.
Once you get that shit out of your system, then you can think clearly again.
You... you got me a fucking hooker?
- Maybe.
- Oh, my God, thank you so much.
This is exactly what I thought having a father would be like.
Oh, no.
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
No.
No, no, no, no.
I know...
I know this has, like, absolutely nothing to do with me, but... but, um, I feel that someone here should be representing your mom's interests.
- Why?
That's fucking weird.
- No, no, no.
Because she would not want you to lose your virginity like this.
Oh, my God, you told her I'm a virgin?
That's fucking embarrassing, dude!
No, of course he didn't.
No offense, but you don't present as a guy who's knee-deep in a river of pussy.
Yet it's all I ever think about.
- Okay, so the first time...
it should be special, right?
- Yeah.
And it should be someone you care about, someone you love, you like, at least...
like.
- Right?
- I completely agree.
And I could easily see myself falling in love with her.
I totally like her right now.
Do you see what she's wearing?
- It's...
- I do, yeah.
But it's not something that you would want to pay for.
I'm not paying for anything.
I haven't even got a paycheck yet.
There's all these forms I'm supposed to fill out and shit.
Actually, can you help me out with that?
Money's taken care of.
That's no problem.
I fucking love you, dad.
I fucking love you too, buddy.
No.
No, no, no.
Stop it, stop it.
Look, Levon, Levon, I know this is very confusing for you.
I get that.
I-I-I...
Okay, take a moment.
Just take a moment.
Just... [Exhales deeply]
- [Exhales deeply]
- Just... yeah.
- Breathe.
- [Exhales deeply]
Yeah.
Okay.
- Now, think about your mother.
- Oh, gross!
That's the last thing I want to think about.
No, no, no!
About what she would say.
Creepy cosby family, are we gonna do this or what?
It's up to you, but there's no fucking refunds here.
If you want a credit, there's a 25% restocking fee.
That's fucking steep, bro.
Hey, it's a seller's market, dude.
Hold... hold... hold on.
- Karen.
- Yes!
Do you want to fuck me?
- No!
- Oh!
What is wrong with you?
Did you...
I didn't raise him.
Right now the only person in this room willing to fuck me is the one getting paid.
Oh.
And I think I'm okay with that.
You know what?
In fact, I'm more than okay with that.
I'm super fucking psyched.
I'm doing this.
Okay.
- Hey, dad?
- Yeah.
- The clit's on top, right?
- Last I checked, yeah.
Okay.
There you go, you lean there.
I'll get the door.
Good job.
[Sighs deeply]
Okay!
[Clears throat] Here we go.
Hey!
What are you doing?
I'm...
I'm driving you home.
Uh, no.
No, not in your car...
In my car.
How am I supposed to get to work tomorrow?
Well, how am I gonna get home tonight?
I don't give a fuck.
That's your problem.
You can take a fucking rickshaw, for all I care.
No, you take me home.
You walk me in.
You make sure that I am safe.
And then you need to position me so that I don't choke on my own vomit.
Okay, okay.
If that's what you need, sure.
Hold on.
That's not a good idea, because then you're gonna get in my house.
You'll want to take advantage of me in my inebriated state.
I would never do something like that.
Oh, I'm not hot enough to take advantage of.
No, no!
You're plenty hot, Goldie.
You're... you're crazy hot!
Thank you.
I appreciate it.
Thank you for taking care of me tonight.
- I really appreciate it.
- You know what?
That's just what I do, okay?
That's full-service management, all right?
Curb to curb.
You know, if someone would've told me that I was gonna be represented one day...
[Sighs] by the masturbating agent,
I would've just shit my panties.
Wonders never cease.
Can I ask you something?
What made you want to throw it all away for a couple of random jerk-off sessions?
I guess it's just the very same thing that makes me such a great representative.
I'm ready to burn it all down at a moment's notice.
Oh, burn it all down.
I like that.
Burn it all down.
I'm gonna get that in a tattoo on my bikini line.
We should get tattoos.
Let's go.
No!
No.
You never get a tattoo under the influence.
That's how you wind up with a butterfly tramp stamp.
[Both laughing]
You're funny.
You're funny.
- Okay.
- You're really funny.
Give me a hug.
You know, I could feel you getting hard last week when we were hugging.
I'm sorry about that.
You're getting hard right now, aren't you?
Why does this keep happening to me?
[Stomach gurgling]
Oh, shit.
I don't feel so good.
- Oh.
- [Gagging]
Okay.
- It's okay.
- Okay.
[Retches]
- [Sighs]
- Oh.
Sorry.
I think I'm allergic to sulfites.
I'm so sorry.
My first time wasn't special at all.
Dude kissed me a couple of times, paid zero attention to my tits, licked me twice, stuck it in once, panicked, pulled out, and shot a load all over my thigh.
Fun stuff.
Well, at least it got you prepared for Papa Runks.
What was your first time like, pretty lady?
Shut up.
You looking to make any extra money?
I could turn you out, no problem.
You're a feisty one.
I like that.
Nice.
Karen...
Karen.
I'm sorry about that.
You know, I don't know what's worse... what's going on here tonight, which is absolutely fucking disgusting, or the fact that I don't even know who you are anymore.
That's not fair.
If we had a son, we'd most probably be having the same conversation, and I would probably feel exactly the same way.
If we had a son, I would never, ever let you do something like this.
Karen, it's just sex.
What's the big deal?
But it's not just sex.
That's the whole point.
You're teaching him to degrade and objectify women, that they exist solely to satisfy his urges, when you could, in fact, be teaching him that the best kind of sex comes from making a connection.
I agree with you.
I do.
It's just, there are all different types of sex to be had, and who says he has to make sweet love his very first time out the gate?
Hi.
- Hank, is it?
- Yeah.
Um, could you come in here for a second?
[Door closes]
Hey, it's more for a threesome.
Just saying.
What's up?
I think your boy's a little nervous.
That's totally understandable.
I asked him to unwrap my dress, and then he almost passed out.
I'm dizzy, Hank.
I'm shaking like a leaf, man.
Is... is it possible I'm having a heart attack?
- Here, feel.
- Mm.
Mm-mm.
Maybe there's an underlying medical condition or something I don't even know about.
M-m-maybe I should go see a doctor.
Maybe we made a mistake here.
May... maybe Karen's right.
Maybe this isn't the way it's supposed to go down for me, you know?
Maybe I'm supposed to meet a nice girl and somehow sweet-talk her into letting me foul her.
You don't have to go through with this, you know, not at all.
You... you wouldn't be disappointed in me?
No way, never.
God, I'm so fucking lame, and you're such a fucking baller.
You are not lame in the slightest.
You're a bright, interesting kid, and you got a shitload of love in your heart.
I do.
You've made the past few weeks of my life very interesting.
- I'm happy to know you.
- Oh, thanks, Dad.
- All right.
- Aw, guys...
This is maybe one of the sweetest fucking things
I've ever seen.
But I have another appointment to get to.
So, if we're not gonna do this, then I'm just gonna grab my double-sided dildo, and I'm just gonna go.
What do you think?
What do you think?
- What do you think?
- I don't know.
Here's what I think.
Oh.
That's what she thinks.
So what's it gonna be?
Get the fuck out of here, okay?
Gone.
Oh, and if you find yourself getting too excited, just think about your grandfather and peeing in his colostomy bag, works like a charm.
Trust!
Hi.
What's going on?
Uh, well, Levon is losing his virginity to a hooker in the guest room right now.
Good for him.
Good for him.
- And who are you?
- He's the pimp.
Jesus Christ.
I handle the fucking money, and I keep her safe from creeps.
Don't be such a condescending prick.
He's the pimp?
Did you piss your pants or something?
Done deal.
Another happy customer.
Kid's got a sick fucking hog on him, by the way.
Hey, you're not supposed to get excited about their fucking cocks.
Well, what?
Some of them are better and nicer than others.
It's a fact.
I had such a fun time, sweetie!
Call me anytime.
Tweet me, whatever.
I will.
Definitely.
You definitely will not!
That shit's expensive.
Well, we offer a frequent-flyer discount.
Peace out, weirdos.
Bye, you honey!
Bye, Marcy.
Thank you.
[Grunts] Take me to bed, Runks.
I haven't been laid in so long,
I'm starting to feel like a born-again virgin.
I'm not feeling very amorous, Marcy.
My new client puked into my crotch tonight.
- Yeah, I can smell it.
- Have a seat, Harpo.
Ah, man.
- How you feeling?
- Amazing.
Amazing.
It's like my head is so fucking clear right now, you know?
It feel like I understand the relationship between shit in the universe a lot better.
I feel like I could honestly solve some of the world's bigger problems.
- You got the poison out.
- Yes.
Exactly.
Yeah.
How long's this feeling gonna last?
- About six or seven minutes.
- Shit.
Better enjoy it, then.
Oh, hey, that thing with my grandpa and the colostomy bag totally worked.
How'd you know he had a bag?
- What?
- You know how you tell your mother everything, you said?
Are you gonna tell her about this?
- No.
No fucking way.
- Okay.
Karen was right.
She would be totally pissed
- and think it was all fucking gross
- Yeah.
and misogynistic and shit.
Okay, well, that's good to know.
Yeah.
Hey, dad?
- Yeah?
- Thanks again.
This was truly an epic fucking night in the life, and I will never, ever forget it, obviously.
You're welcome.
You're welcome.
That's a wet one.
You better get me a kick-ass father's day gift.
Oh, you know I will.
In fact, I think I'm gonna book you some time with Nikki.
She did this thing with her vagina.
- It was talking to my dick.
- That's too much.
- Smell my fingers.
- Go to bed.
Okay.
♪ Well, he went out to dinner in his Sunday best ♪
♪ Excitable boy, they all said ♪
Previously on Californication:
Whoa, you have a surprisingly big dick.
Oh, but that doesn't make me want to be with you, Levon.
I'm not saying what he did is right.
But I get where he's coming from, you know?
He's a guy.
He just wants to get laid.
It's totally normal.
You have another family.
The bottom has just officially dropped out of our relationship.
Have you given any thought to taking on a manager?
I could see us working together.
Help me get the show out from under Rath, and I'm yours.
There is nothing limp-dick about you, Charlie.
I mean, she's so beautiful.
Is it cool if I pursue her?
You're not looking to rekindle?
- No, no, not at all.
- Why not?
- This is a terrible idea.
- It's a terrible idea.
Hey, you rang?
- Yeah, how's that outline going?
- Not great.
It's kind of like having an impacted bowel and you're forced to stick your finger up your ass and pry the shit out one dry, flaky chunk at a time, except with words.
- Thank you for that.
- You're welcome.
Didn't know you played.
- Just enough to know how much I suck.
- Copy that, motherfucker.
I am going out on a date with Julia tonight.
Oh, the real reason you summoned me.
Maybe.
You okay with that?
If the lady's cool with it, I'm cool with it.
The kid?
Think he'll be cool with it?
- I thought you didn't care.
- You wanted to see me, Mr. Rath, sir?
Yeah, hey, come in, come in.
Have a seat.
- How you doing, buddy?
- Couldn't be better.
- Good.
- Want some chocolate?
No, thank you.
Listen, I wanted you to know that I'm taking your mom out tonight.
- Hank supports it.
- Yeah, I know all about it.
- What, she told you?
- Yeah, we tell each other everything.
- E*verything?
- Pretty much, yeah.
One time my Aunt Jesse stayed with us for a few days.
It was around the time I started jerking off.
She leaves a pair of panties behind.
I'd sniff them while I hit it.
Really enhanced the orgasm, you know?
Then I started to feel weird and guilty about it.
So I told my mom.
She was so fucking cool about it.
She was pretty hot for an aunt, though, Aunt Jesse.
- Maybe I should rethink this thing.
- Oh, no, no, don't.
Look, my mom's a great lady.
She deserves to have fun with men.
Gross.
Just be cool, okay?
Anyone can be a dick.
Be a gentleman.
Think about it like I was dating your mom.
I don't want to think about like that.
My mom is dead.
Oh, my God, I am so sorry.
I had no idea.
- Was she hot?
- Holy shit.
Hey, you know, the good news here is I'm totally free to hang tonight.
What do you want to do?
So who recommended you?
Mommy, why are you hurting that lady's "bagina"?
Stuart, I told you to stay in your room.
Mommy's working.
It's okay, honey.
She's not hurting it.
I mean, it hurts a little bit.
Actually, it hurts a lot.
But she's just taking the hair off.
- He doesn't need to...
- Why are you taking the hair off?
- Stuart...
- Because boys like the way it looks.
Honey, I need you to go back to your room now.
I don't like it.
It looks like a big pink walnut.
All right, then, run along now.
He is so cute.
Yes, he is a little dolly.
Just like his dad.
It's weird.
Okay, so who recommended you?
- Stu Beggs.
- Oh, okay, my ex.
Yeah, he said that you probably needed the work.
He said that your husband isn't much of an earner, so...
I'm sure he did.
And no, he is not.
He talks about you a lot, actually.
I think that he's still in love with you.
Well, actually, he has said that out loud, like, a lot.
Wait, so how do you guys know each other?
- He's a client.
- Oh, okay.
So, what are you, like, a publicist or something?
- More like...
- A hooker?
- Yeah, pretty much.
- Yeah, that's real neat.
- Sorry.
- No, it's fine.
No judgment.
So, Stu's big into prostitutes these days.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah, he must be nursing a broken heart or something because he drops a lot of cash on 'tutes.
I like to think that I'm his favorite, but he's not really very picky.
I'll tell you what, though.
He calls me Marcy when we bone.
Good to know.
Cheers.
Shit.
Jesus Christ, that tastes awful.
- Drink up.
It'll put hair on your balls.
- I've got too much hair on my balls.
You see this fucking mop?
Now picture my balls.
This is a house where the carpet definitely matches the drapes.
That's not how you use that phrase.
- It's not?
- No.
You've really never had a serious girlfriend?
Well, not really.
I mean, I've had my fair share of texting relationships.
But they always end with me saying something really inappropriate and then the girl goes silent and then I end up texting her more and her parents call my mom I get a talking-to about cyberbullying.
It's a real fucking bummer.
Yeah, you need to start dealing with some real live women, one-on-one.
That's fucking scary.
Yeah, but still...
- Here's your shot.
- You sure?
Go forth.
Hi.
Hi, pretty lady.
Do you want to have a drink with me and my dad?
We recently started a relationship with each other.
Hey, I know you.
- Dude, did you bang her?
- Shut up.
Really?
Where from?
- I was your student.
- Oh, yeah.
- I took your writing class.
- That's right.
I taught for a while.
I totally forgot about that.
How was I?
Honestly, I've had better.
Honestly, I've been better.
That was a dark time.
But allow me to make it up to you by introducing you to a promising young actor on the rise Levon.
- Cool.
What have you been in?
Not much of anything, really.
I mean, sometimes I film myself doing famous movie monologues and I put them on YouTube.
I figure someone will...
Oh, he's being modest.
He's working on a new show called Santa Monica Cop.
I'm just a PA, really.
I get lunches and shit.
Cool.
Hey, you were sleeping with that girl who turned out to be a stripper, right?
What?
That is silly.
Teachers sleeping with students.
That's not cool.
No, it was a really big deal.
Didn't you fuck that TA too?
And the dean's wife?
You were famous that semester.
You fucked them all.
Hey, could I get a picture with you?
My friend is gonna lose her shit.
Would you mind?
Thanks, Dad.
One, two, three.
Goldie?
You in there?
What fucking took you so long, Runkle?
I came as soon as you called.
Are you okay?
Have you been drinking?
Obviously.
- Maybe this is a mistake.
- What?
What?
Why?
Why?
What are you talking about?
I need a manager who cares about me as much as about what me can do for him.
I do, Goldie, very much so.
What can I do for you?
How can I help?
Get me off this fucking show.
- Why?
- Rath humiliated me.
What did he do?
Did he hit on you?
No, he would never do that.
I'm sure he thinks I'm an unfuckable monster.
Oh, I don't think that's true at all.
Thank you, Charlie.
You make me feel really sexy.
Oh, I didn't mean to do that, exactly.
But good, I guess.
So, what did Rath do?
He fucking rewrote my script.
Well, isn't that, you know, par for the course in television?
E*very single fucking line?
You mean to tell me I didn't write one usable word?
Not even a fucking preposition or two.
Okay, okay, okay.
So, what would you like me to do, Goldie?
- Would you want me to?
- Have him killed.
Have him killed.
Okay.
What do you say we put a pin in that one for now, just for now and we look at that as a you know, last-resort situation?
You know, the very least you could fucking do is call him and rip him a new asshole so that he knows I can't be treated like some girl from the street.
I'm a world-class writer and producer and I'm gonna have my own show one day if that means giving up every ounce of personal happiness to get it.
I will talk to him.
- Promise?
- I promise.
Will you drive me home?
- Sure thing, Goldie.
- Okay.
- Let's go.
- One more drink.
He's a little monster.
- I'm gonna get you.
- I'm gonna get you!
Oh, my God.
This is the best play date Stuart's ever had.
They do have chemistry, that's for sure.
- He seems like a good kid.
- He is, he is.
- I just wish I could get him laid.
- Can you get me laid?
Maybe we can kill two pervs with one stone.
You deflower him.
It's a win-win.
Listen, I'm horny as fuck these days but I don't think that kid will last long enough for Mommy to get hers.
Maybe he needs professional help.
- What, like a therapist?
- Yeah, or a...
- Like a hooker?
- Yeah.
Hank, I waxed a hooker today.
She was young, cute, and totally down to fuck.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Probably spendy.
- It's only money, right?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
That kid would love you forever if you bust his hymen like that.
Chick was fucking bananas hot.
This sounds too good to be true.
Let's hold on a second.
Wait, wait, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Is this wrong?
I can't tell anymore.
- I can't fucking tell anymore.
- Me, neither.
- Let me see if she's available.
- Good idea.
- Hello, again.
- Hi.
Thanks for the rip this morning.
My pussy looks fantastic.
It really does.
I mean, great job.
You could eat off the fucking thing.
- Thank you, and you are?
- Jim.
Nice to meet you, sweetie.
- Nice to meet you too.
- Is this him?
No.
No, sorry.
Hey, you're not supposed to get excited about the fucking johns.
- Sorry, he's a really good-Iooking guy.
- You must be the pimp.
What is this, like a fucking Blaxploitation movie?
I mean, we don't really use that terminology anymore.
Yeah, I'm more like her manager, the guy you hand the money to like right now.
- Oh, yeah.
Sure, sure, sure.
So how does it work?
What's the split?
My guy gets 15 percent and his pimp hand is not strong at all.
Are you the Better Business Bureau?
Don't worry about it.
Where's this dude she's gonna fuck?
- Hey, guys.
- Karen, hello.
- Hi!
- Karen!
Hey, hey, hey.
Why don't you get your guests a drink?
- Yes, I'm gonna do it.
- Hi, what are you doing here?
- Well, you've been ducking my calls.
- I know, I know.
Okay, so, I want to talk to you about Becca.
- I know, that's why I'm ducking you.
- Well, why?
When are you gonna tell her about Levon?
- When is she back?
- In a few weeks.
- In a few weeks, then.
- Well, Hank she wants to know why you're ducking her calls too.
I'm not gonna talk to her on the phone about this shit.
And in fact, when I do it, I think we should do it together, you and I.
- No.
You see...
- Yeah.
- No, no, no.
I knew...
- What?
I am not gonna get involved in your dysfunctional shit, okay?
- What...?
What are you...?
What is this?
- What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Marcy invited some of her waxing clients over.
- Isn't that right, Marcy?
- Yeah.
I'm having a client over for a drink.
Okay, well, how come she's here so late and dressed so slutty?
- Maybe she's gonna get a facial.
- Right.
Really?
Does she always travel with sex toys?
You know, some people are not so averse to rubberized help.
That's true.
Yay, mission accomplished.
Little Stuart is officially asleep.
We read books, played the tickle game.
- He loves the tickle game.
- I know.
I taught him how to Dutch oven.
He loved it.
Kid loves farts.
Oh, you did good.
- Thanks.
- Is this him?
- Who's him?
Who am I?
Who are you?
- You know what?
Let's get this fucking party started.
We got another appointment later.
Kid, you gotta wear a rubber.
Okay?
Anything off the menu has to be approved by me.
I mean, she's pretty open, as you can see.
But scat play, definitely out of the question.
Oh, my God.
- You got him a hooker.
- Karen, that is ridiculous.
Marcy was kind enough to set Levon up with one of her clients.
- One of your clients?
Oh, really?
- I'm setting him up with her.
Look what a cute couple they'd make.
- Adorable.
- Marcy, is your client a hooker?
Who knows what she does for a living?
That's personal.
Shut up.
Is your client a hooker?
- Maybe.
- Marcy.
Hey, I am happy to help you try to bust your weirdo kid's cherry but I will not lie to my best friend.
Oh, my God.
This is so fucking depraved.
No, it's not.
I'm performing a service here.
This kid's...
He needs to clear this hurdle.
He's wired and pent-up.
Gotta get the poison out.
- That's what Stu always says.
- It's true.
Once you get that shit out, you can think clearly again.
You got me a fucking hooker?
- Maybe.
- Oh, my God.
Thank you so much.
This is exactly what I thought having a father would be like.
Oh, no.
Oh, no.
I'm sorry.
No.
No, no, no.
I know this is, like, absolutely nothing to do with me but I feel that someone here should be representing your mom's interest.
- Why?
That's fucking weird.
- No, no, no.
Because she would not want you to lose your virginity like this.
Oh, my God, you told her I'm a virgin?
- No.
- That's embarrassing, dude.
No offense, but you don't present as a guy who's knee-deep in pussy.
Yet it's all I ever think about.
Okay, so the first time, it should be special, right?
And it should be someone you care about, someone you love you like, at least, like.
Right?
- I completely agree and I could easily see myself falling in love with her.
I totally like her now.
See what she's wearing?
I do, yeah.
But it's not something that you would want to pay for.
I'm not paying.
I haven't even got a paycheck yet.
There's forms I'm supposed to fill out.
Actually, can you help me out with that?
Money's taken care of.
That's no problem.
- I fucking love you, Dad.
- I fucking love you too, buddy.
No, no, no.
Stop it, stop it.
Look, Levon, Levon, I know this is very confusing for you.
I get that.
L...
Okay, take a moment.
Just take a moment.
Just:
Just, yeah, breathe.
Yeah, okay.
Now think about your mother.
Gross.
That's the last thing I want to think about.
No, about what she would say.
Creepy Cosby family, we gonna do this?
It's up to you.
But there's no fucking refunds here.
If you want credit, it's a 25 percent restocking fee.
- That's fucking steep, bro.
- It's a seller's market, dude.
- Hold on.
Karen.
- Yes?
- Yes?
- Do you want to fuck me?
- No.
- Oh, my God.
- What is wrong with you?
Did you...?
- I didn't raise him.
The only person willing to fuck me is the one getting paid.
I think I'm okay with that.
You know, in fact, I'm more than okay with that.
I'm super fucking psyched.
- I'm doing this.
- Okay.
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah?
The clit's on top, right?
Last I checked, yeah.
Okay.
There you go, you lean there.
I'll get the door.
Good job.
Okay.
Here we go.
Hey, what are you doing?
I'm driving you home.
Oh, no.
No, not in your car.
In my car.
How am I supposed to get to work tomorrow?
Well, how am I gonna get home tonight?
I don't give a fuck.
That's your problem.
You can take a fucking rickshaw, for all I care.
No, you take me home.
You walk me in.
You make sure that I am safe.
And then you need to position me so that I don't choke on my own vomit.
Okay, okay.
If that's what you need, sure.
Hold on, that's not a good idea because then you're gonna get in my house.
You'll want to take advantage of me in my inebriated state.
I would never do something like that.
I'm not hot enough to take advantage of?
No, no, you're plenty hot, Goldie.
You're crazy hot.
Thank you.
I appreciate it.
Thank you for taking care of me tonight...
You know what?
That's just what I do, okay?
That's a full-service management, all right?
Curb to curb.
You know if someone would've told me that I was gonna be represented one day by the masturbating agent I would've just shit my panties.
Will wonders never cease?
Can I ask you something?
What made you want to throw it all away for a couple of random jerk-off sessions?
I guess it's just the very same thing that makes me such a great representative.
I'm ready to burn it all down at a moment's notice.
Oh, "burn it all down." I like that.
"Burn it all down." I'm gonna get that in a tattoo on my bikini line.
- We should get tattoos.
Let's go.
- No, no.
You never get a tattoo under the influence.
That's how you wind up with a butterfly tramp stamp.
- You're funny.
- Okay, yeah.
- You're funny.
Really funny.
- Okay.
Give me a hug.
You know, I could feel you getting hard last week when we were hugging.
I'm sorry about that.
You're getting hard right now, aren't you?
Why does this keep happening to me?
Oh, shit.
I don't feel so good.
Okay...
- It's okay.
- Okay.
Sorry.
I think I'm allergic to sulfites.
So sorry.
It's all over your crotch.
My first time wasn't special at all.
Dude kissed me a couple of times paid zero attention to my tits licked me twice, stuck it in once panicked, pulled out, and shot a load all over my thigh.
It was fun stuff.
Well, at least it got you prepared for Papa Runks.
What was your first time like, pretty lady?
Shut up.
You looking to make any extra money?
I could turn you out, no problem.
You're a feisty one, I like that.
Nice.
Karen.
- Karen, I'm sorry about that.
- You know, I don't know what's worse.
What's going on here tonight, which is absolutely disgusting or that I don't know who you are anymore.
That's not fair.
If we had a son we'd most probably be having the same conversation and I would probably feel exactly the same way.
If we had a son, I would never, ever let you do something like this.
Karen, it's just sex.
What's the big deal?
But it's not just sex.
That's the whole point.
You're teaching him to degrade and objectify women that they exist solely to satisfy his urges when you could, in fact, be teaching him that the best kind of sex comes from making a connection.
I agree with you.
I do.
It's just, there are all different types of sex to be had.
And who says he has to make sweet love his very first time out the gate?
- Hi.
Hank, is it?
- Yeah.
Could you come in here for a second?
Hey, it's more for a threesome.
Just saying.
- What's up?
- I think your boy's a little nervous.
- It's totally understandable.
- I asked him to unwrap my dress and then he almost passed out.
I'm dizzy, Hank.
I'm shaking like a leaf, man.
Is it possible I'm having a heart attack?
Here, feel.
Maybe there's a medical condition or something I don't know about.
- Maybe I should go see a doctor.
- Maybe we made a mistake here.
Maybe Karen's right.
Maybe this isn't the way it's supposed to go down.
Maybe I'm supposed to meet a nice girl and somehow sweet-talk her into letting me foul her.
You don't have to go through with this, you know, not at all.
- You wouldn't be disappointed in me?
- No way.
Never.
God, I'm so fucking lame, and you're such a fucking baller.
You are not lame in the slightest.
You're a bright, interesting kid and got a shitload of love in your heart.
- I do.
- You've made the past few weeks of my life very interesting.
I'm happy to know you.
- Thanks, Dad.
- All right.
Oh, guys.
This is maybe one of the sweetest fucking things I've ever seen.
But I have another appointment.
If we're not doing this then I'm gonna grab my double-sided dildo and I'm just gonna go.
What do you think?
- What do you think?
- What do you think?
- I don't know.
- Here's what I think.
That's what she thinks.
So, what's it gonna be?
Get the fuck out of here, okay?
Gone.
Oh, if you find yourself getting too excited think about your grandfather emptying his colostomy bag.
Works like a charm.
Trust.
Hey.
What's going on?
Well, Levon is losing his virginity to a hooker in the guest room right now.
Good for him.
Good for him.
- Who are you?
- He's the pimp.
Jesus Christ.
I handle the fucking money, and I keep her safe from creeps.
Don't be such a condescending prick.
- He's the pimp.
- Did you piss your pants or something?
Done deal.
Another happy customer.
Kid's got a sick fucking hog on him, by the way.
Hey, you're not supposed to get excited about their cocks.
Well, what?
Some of them are better and nicer than others.
That's a fact.
I had such a fun time, sweetie.
Call me anytime.
Tweet me, whatever.
- I will, definitely.
- You definitely will not.
- That shit's expensive.
- Well, we offer a frequent flyer discount.
Peace out, weirdoes.
- Bye, you honey.
- Bye, Marcy.
Thank you.
Take me to bed, Runks.
I haven't been laid in so long I'm starting to feel like a born-again virgin.
I'm not feeling very amorous, Marcy.
My new client puked into my crotch tonight.
- Yeah, I can smell it.
- Have a seat, Harpo.
Oh, man.
- How you feeling?
- Amazing.
Amazing.
It's like my head is so fucking clear right now, you know?
I feel like I understand the relationship between shit in the universe a lot better.
I feel like I could solve the world's bigger problems.
- You got the poison out.
- Yes, exactly.
- Yeah.
- How long is this feeling going to last?
- About six or seven minutes.
- Shit.
Better enjoy it, then.
Oh, hey, that thing with my Grandpa and the colostomy bag totally worked.
How'd you know he had a bag?
- What?
- You said you tell your mother everything.
- Are you gonna tell her about this?
- No.
No fucking way.
Karen was right.
She would be totally pissed and think it was all fucking gross and misogynistic and shit.
- Okay, that's good to know.
- Yeah.
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah?
Thanks again.
This was truly an epic fucking night in my life and I will never ever forget...
- You're welcome, you're welcome.
It's a wet one.
You'd better get me a kick-ass Father's Day gift.
You know I will.
In fact, I'm gonna book you some time with Nikki.
She did this thing with her vagina.
It was talking to my dick.
That's too much.
Smell my fingers.
- Go to bed.
- Okay.
Ripped By mstoll
Previously on Californication...
Whoa!
You have a surprisingly big dick.
Oh, but that doesn't make me want to be with you, Levon.
I'm not saying what he did is right.
But I get where he's coming from, you know?
He's a guy.
He just wants to get laid.
It's totally normal.
You have another family.
The bottom has just officially dropped out of our relationship!
Have you ever given any thought to taking on a manager?
I could totally see us working together.
You help me get the show out from under Rath, and I'm all yours.
There is nothing limp dick about you, Charlie.
I mean, she's so beautiful.
Is it cool if, uh, I pursue her?
- You're not looking to rekindle?
- No.
- No, not at all.
- Why not?
- This is...
- It's a terrible idea.
a terrible idea.
Hey!
You rang?
Yeah.
How's that outline going?
Not great.
It's kind of like having an impacted bowel and you're forced to stick your finger up your ass and pry the shit out one dry, flaky chunk at a time, except with words.
- Thank you for that.
- You're welcome.
Didn't know you played.
Just enough to know how much I suck.
Copy that, motherfucker.
Um, I am going out on a date with Julia tonight.
Oh.
The real reason you summoned me.
Maybe.
You okay with that?
If the lady's cool with it, I'm cool with it.
What about the kid?
You think he'll be cool with it?
I thought you didn't care about such things.
You wanted to see me, Mr. Rath, sir?
Yeah, hey!
Come in, come in.
Have a seat.
- How you doing, buddy?
- Couldn't be better.
- Good.
- Want some chocolate?
No, thank you.
Listen...
Uh, I wanted you to know that, uh, I'm taking your mom out tonight.
- Hank supports it.
- Yeah, I-I know all about it.
- What, she told you?
- Yeah.
We tell each other everything.
Everything?
Pretty much, yeah.
One time, my Aunt Jesse stayed with us for a few days, and it was right around the time I started jerking off.
So she leaves a pair of her panties behind.
I used to sniff 'em while I hit it.
Really enhanced the orgasm, you know?
Then I started to feel, like, weird and guilty about it, so I told my mom.
She was so fucking cool about it.
She's pretty hot for an aunt, Aunt Jesse.
Maybe I should rethink this thing.
Oh, no, no.
Don't.
Look, look, my mom's a great lady.
She... she deserves to have fun with men.
Gross.
J-just be cool, okay?
Anyone can be a dick.
Be a gentleman, you know?
Think about it like if I was gonna date your mom.
I don't want to think about it like that.
My mom is dead.
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
I had no idea.
Was she hot?
Holy shit.
Hey, you know, the... the good news here is I'm totally free to hang tonight.
What do you want to do?
So who recommended you?
Mommy!
Why are you hurting that lady's "Bagina"?
Stuart, I told you to stay your room.
Mommy's working.
It's okay, honey.
She's not hurting it.
I mean, it hurts a little bit.
Actually, it hurts a lot.
But she's just taking the hair off.
Okay, yeah, he doesn't need to...
Why are you taking the hair off?
Stuart...
Because boys like the way it looks.
Honey, I need you to go back to your room now.
I don't like it at all.
It looks like a big pink walnut.
All right, then, run along now.
Wow.
He is so cute.
Yes.
He is a little dolly... just like his dad.
It's weird.
Okay, so who recommended you?
Stu Beggs.
Oh, okay, my ex.
Yeah.
He said that you probably needed the work.
He said that your husband isn't much of an earner, so...
I'm sure he did.
And, no, he is not.
He talks about you a lot, actually.
I think that he's still in love with you.
Well, actually, he has said that out loud, like, a lot.
Wait.
So how do you guys know each other?
- He's a client.
- Oh, okay.
So what are you, like, a publicist or something?
- More like...
- A hooker?
- Yeah.
- Yeah!
- Pretty much.
- That's real neat.
Sorry.
No, it's fine.
No judgment.
So, uh, Stu's big into prostitutes these days.
- Yeah.
- Yeah.
Yeah, he must be nursing a broken heart or something because he drops a lot of cash on 'tutes.
I like to think that I'm his favorite, but he's not really very picky.
- Hmm.
- I'll tell you what, though.
He calls me Marcy when we bone.
Oh!
Good to know.
♪ I wish I could meet Elvis ♪
♪ And talk to him for a while ♪
Cheers.
Shit!
Jesus Christ, that tastes awful.
Drink up, Nancy.
It'll put hair on your balls.
I've got too much hair on my balls.
You see this fucking mop?
Now picture my balls.
This is a house where the carpet definitely matches the drapes.
Yeah, that's not how you use that phrase.
- It's not?
- No.
Oh.
You've really never had a serious girlfriend.
Well, not really.
I mean, I've had my fair share of texting relationships, but they always end with me saying something really inappropriate, and then the girl goes silent, and then I end up texting her a hundred more times,
and her parents call my mom, and I get a serious talking-to about cyberbullying.
It's... it's a real fucking bummer.
Yeah, you need to start dealing with some real live women one-on-one.
Ooh, that is fucking scary.
Yeah, but still...
Oh.
- Here's your shot.
- You sure?
Go forth.
- Oh!
- Hi.
Uh, hi, pr... pretty lady.
Um...
Do... do you... do you want to have a drink with me and my dad?
We just recently started a relationship with each other.
Hey, I know you.
- Dude, did you bang her?
- Shh.
Shut up.
Really?
Where from?
- I was your student.
- Oh, yeah.
I took your writing class.
That's right.
I taught for a while.
I totally forgot about that.
How was I?
Honestly, I've had better.
Honestly, I've been better.
That was a dark time.
But allow me to make it up to you by introducing you to a promising young actor on the rise...
- Oh.
- Levon.
Cool.
What have you been in?
Not... not much of anything, really.
I mean, sometimes I film myself doing famous movie monologues, and I put them on YouTube.
I figure someone will eventually...
Oh, he's being modest.
He's working on a new show called Santa Monica Cop.
I-I'm just a PA, really.
I-I get lunches and shit.
Cool.
Hey, you were sleeping with that girl who turned out to be a stripper, right?
What?
That is silly.
Teachers sleeping with students... that's not cool.
No, it was a really big deal.
Didn't you fuck that TA too and the dean's wife?
You were famous that semester.
You fucked them all.
- Wow.
- Hey... could I get a picture with you?
My friend is gonna lose her shit.
Would you mind?
Thanks, Dad.
One, two, three.
Goldie?
You in there?
What fucking took you so long, Runkle?
I came as soon as you called.
Are you okay?
- Have you been drinking?
- Obviously.
- Maybe this is a mistake.
- What?
What?
Why?
What... what are you talking about?
I need a manager who cares about me as much as about what me can do for him.
I do, Goldie, very much so.
What can I do for you?
- How can I help?
- Get me off this fucking show.
Why?
Rath humiliated me.
Ah.
What did he do?
Did he hit on you?
No!
He would never do that.
I'm sure he thinks I'm an unfuckable monster.
Oh, I don't think that's true at all.
Thank you, Charlie.
You make me feel really sexy.
Oh, I-I didn't mean to do that exactly.
But good, I guess.
So what did Rath do?
He fucking rewrote my script.
Oh, well, isn't that, you know, par for the course in television?
Every single fucking line?
You mean to tell me I didn't write one usable word?
Not even a fucking preposition or two.
Okay, okay, okay.
So what would you like me to do, Goldie?
Would you... would you want me to, um...
Have him killed.
Have him killed.
Okay.
Uh, what do you say we put a pin in that one, hmm... for now, just for now... and we look at that as a, um... you know, last-resort situation?
You know, the very least you could fucking do is call him and rip him a new asshole so that he knows I can't be treated like some girl from the street, okay?
I'm a world-class writer and producer, and I'm gonna have my own show one day, if that means giving up every ounce of personal happiness to get it.
I will talk to him.
- Promise?
- I promise.
Will you drive me home?
- Sure thing, Goldie.
- Okay.
- Let's go.
- One more drink.
- Aah!
Raah!
- He's a little monster!
I'm gonna getcha, I'm gonna getcha,
- I'm gonna getcha!
- I'm gonna get you!
Oh, my God.
This is the best playdate Stuart's ever had.
They do have chemistry, that's for sure.
- He seems like a good kid.
- He is, he is.
I just wish I could get him laid.
Can you get me laid?
Maybe we can kill two pervs with one stone.
You deflower him.
It's a win-win.
Listen, I'm horny as fuck these days, but seriously, I don't think that kid's gonna last long enough for mommy to get hers.
Maybe he needs professional help.
What, like a therapist?
Yeah, or a...
- Like a hooker?
- Yeah.
Hank, I waxed a hooker today.
She was young and cute and totally down to fuck.
- Really?
- Yeah.
- Probably spendy.
- It's only money, right?
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.
That kid would love you forever if you bust his hymen like that.
Chick was fucking bananas hot!
This sounds too good to be true.
- Let's just hold on a second.
- Okay.
Just wait, wait.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Is this wrong?
I can't tell anymore.
I can't fucking tell anymore.
Me neither.
- Let me see if she's available.
- Good idea.
- Hello, again.
- Hi.
Thanks for the rip this morning.
My pussy looks fantastic.
It really does.
I mean, great job!
You could eat off the fucking thing.
Thank you.
And you are?
Jim.
Nice to meet you, sweetie.
Oh.
Nice to meet you too.
Is this him?
No!
Ha ha!
No, sorry.
Hey, you're not supposed to get excited about the fucking Johns here.
Sorry.
He's a really good-looking guy.
You must be the pimp.
What is this, like a fucking blaxploitation movie?
I mean, we don't really use that terminology anymore.
Oh.
Yeah, I'm more like her manager, the guy that you hand the money to...
- Okay.
- Like, right now.
Oh, oh, yeah.
Sure, sure, sure.
So how does it work?
What's the split?
My guy gets 15%, and his pimp hand is not strong at all.
What are you, the Better Business Bureau?
Don't worry about it.
Where's this dude she's gonna fuck?
- Hey, guys.
- Hi!
- Karen, hello.
- Hi!
- Hi!
- Karen!
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Why don't you get your guests a drink or something?
- Yes, I'm gonna do it.
- What are you doing here?
Um, well, you've been ducking my calls.
I know, I know, I know.
Okay, so I want to talk to you about Becca.
I know.
That's why I'm ducking you.
Well, why?
I mean, when are you gonna tell her about Levon?
- When is she getting back?
- In a few weeks.
- In a few weeks, then.
- Well, Hank, she wants to know why you're ducking her calls too.
Karen, I'm not gonna talk to her on the phone about this shit, okay?
And in fact, when I do it,
I think we should do it together, you and I.
- No!
- Yeah.
No, no, no.
I knew...
I am not gonna get involved in your dysfunctional shit, okay?
What is... what are you hi... what is this?
What do you mean?
What do you mean?
Who is this?
Marcy invited some waxing clients over.
- Isn't that right, Marcy?
- Yeah, yeah.
I'm having a client over for a drink.
Okay, well, um, how come she's here so late and dressed so slutty?
Maybe she's gonna get a facial.
Right.
Really?
Does she always travel with... sex toys?
You know, some people are not so averse
- to, uh, rubberized help.
- That's true.
Yay!
Mission accomplished.
Little Stuart is officially asleep.
We read books.
We played the tickle game.
He loves the tickle game!
I know.
I also taught him how to dutch oven.
He loved it.
Kid loves farts.
Ooh, you did good.
- Thanks.
- Is this him?
Who... who's him?
Who am I?
- Who are you?
- You know what?
Let's get this fucking party started, all right?
We got another appointment later.
Okay, kid, you got to wear a rubber, okay?
Anything off the menu has to be approved by me.
I mean, she's pretty open, as you can see, but scat play... definitely out of the question.
Oh, my God.
You got him a hooker.
Karen, that is ridiculous.
Marcy was kind enough to set Levon up
- with one of her clients.
- One of your clients?
I'm...
I'm...
I'm setting him up with her.
Look at what a cute couple they would make, adorable.
Marcy... is your client a hooker?
Who knows what she does for a living, Karen?
- That's personal.
- Shut up.
Is your client a hooker?
- Maybe.
- Marcy!
Hey!
I am happy to help you try to bust your weirdo kid's cherry, but I will not lie to my best friend.
Oh, my God.
This is so fucking depraved.
No, it's not.
I-I'm performing a service here.
This kid's... he needs to clear this hurdle.
He's all wired and pent-up.
He's got to get the poison out.
- That's what Stu always says.
- It's true.
Once you get that shit out of your system, then you can think clearly again.
You... you got me a fucking hooker?
- Maybe.
- Oh, my God, thank you so much.
This is exactly what I thought having a father would be like.
Oh, no.
Oh, no, I'm sorry.
No.
No, no, no, no.
I know...
I know this has, like, absolutely nothing to do with me, but... but, um, I feel that someone here should be representing your mom's interests.
- Why?
That's fucking weird.
- No, no, no.
Because she would not want you to lose your virginity like this.
Oh, my God, you told her I'm a virgin?
That's fucking embarrassing, dude!
No, of course he didn't.
No offense, but you don't present as a guy who's knee-deep in a river of pussy.
Yet it's all I ever think about.
- Okay, so the first time...
it should be special, right?
- Yeah.
And it should be someone you care about, someone you love, you like, at least...
like.
- Right?
- I completely agree.
And I could easily see myself falling in love with her.
I totally like her right now.
Do you see what she's wearing?
- It's...
- I do, yeah.
But it's not something that you would want to pay for.
I'm not paying for anything.
I haven't even got a paycheck yet.
There's all these forms I'm supposed to fill out and shit.
Actually, can you help me out with that?
Money's taken care of.
That's no problem.
I fucking love you, dad.
I fucking love you too, buddy.
No.
No, no, no.
Stop it, stop it.
Look, Levon, Levon, I know this is very confusing for you.
I get that.
I-I-I...
Okay, take a moment.
Just take a moment.
Just...
Just... yeah.
Breathe.
Yeah.
Okay.
- Now, think about your mother.
- Oh, gross!
That's the last thing I want to think about.
No, no, no!
About what she would say.
Creepy cosby family, are we gonna do this or what?
It's up to you, but there's no fucking refunds here.
If you want a credit, there's a 25% restocking fee.
That's fucking steep, bro.
Hey, it's a seller's market, dude.
Hold... hold... hold on.
- Karen.
- Yes!
Do you want to fuck me?
- No!
- Oh!
What is wrong with you?
Did you...
I didn't raise him.
Right now the only person in this room willing to fuck me is the one getting paid.
Oh.
And I think I'm okay with that.
You know what?
In fact, I'm more than okay with that.
I'm super fucking psyched.
I'm doing this.
Okay.
- Hey, dad?
- Yeah.
- The clit's on top, right?
- Last I checked, yeah.
Okay.
There you go, you lean there.
I'll get the door.
Good job.
Okay!
Here we go.
Hey!
What are you doing?
I'm...
I'm driving you home.
Uh, no.
No, not in your car...
In my car.
How am I supposed to get to work tomorrow?
Well, how am I gonna get home tonight?
I don't give a fuck.
That's your problem.
You can take a fucking rickshaw, for all I care.
No, you take me home.
You walk me in.
You make sure that I am safe.
And then you need to position me so that I don't choke on my own vomit.
Okay, okay.
If that's what you need, sure.
Hold on.
That's not a good idea, because then you're gonna get in my house.
You'll want to take advantage of me in my inebriated state.
I would never do something like that.
Oh, I'm not hot enough to take advantage of.
No, no!
You're plenty hot, Goldie.
You're... you're crazy hot!
Thank you.
I appreciate it.
Thank you for taking care of me tonight.
- I really appreciate it.
- You know what?
That's just what I do, okay?
That's full-service management, all right?
Curb to curb.
You know, if someone would've told me that I was gonna be represented one day... by the masturbating agent,
I would've just shit my panties.
Wonders never cease.
Can I ask you something?
What made you want to throw it all away for a couple of random jerk-off sessions?
I guess it's just the very same thing that makes me such a great representative.
I'm ready to burn it all down at a moment's notice.
Oh, burn it all down.
I like that.
Burn it all down.
I'm gonna get that in a tattoo on my bikini line.
We should get tattoos.
Let's go.
No!
No.
You never get a tattoo under the influence.
That's how you wind up with a butterfly tramp stamp.
You're funny.
You're funny.
- Okay.
- You're really funny.
Give me a hug.
You know, I could feel you getting hard last week when we were hugging.
I'm sorry about that.
You're getting hard right now, aren't you?
Why does this keep happening to me?
Oh, shit.
I don't feel so good.
Oh.
Okay.
- It's okay.
- Okay.
Oh.
Sorry.
I think I'm allergic to sulfites.
I'm so sorry.
My first time wasn't special at all.
Dude kissed me a couple of times, paid zero attention to my tits, licked me twice, stuck it in once, panicked, pulled out, and shot a load all over my thigh.
Fun stuff.
Well, at least it got you prepared for Papa Runks.
What was your first time like, pretty lady?
Shut up.
You looking to make any extra money?
I could turn you out, no problem.
You're a feisty one.
I like that.
Nice.
Karen...
Karen.
I'm sorry about that.
You know, I don't know what's worse... what's going on here tonight, which is absolutely fucking disgusting, or the fact that I don't even know who you are anymore.
That's not fair.
If we had a son, we'd most probably be having the same conversation, and I would probably feel exactly the same way.
If we had a son, I would never, ever let you do something like this.
Karen, it's just sex.
What's the big deal?
But it's not just sex.
That's the whole point.
You're teaching him to degrade and objectify women, that they exist solely to satisfy his urges, when you could, in fact, be teaching him that the best kind of sex comes from making a connection.
I agree with you.
I do.
It's just, there are all different types of sex to be had, and who says he has to make sweet love his very first time out the gate?
Hi.
- Hank, is it?
- Yeah.
Um, could you come in here for a second?
Hey, it's more for a threesome.
Just saying.
What's up?
I think your boy's a little nervous.
That's totally understandable.
I asked him to unwrap my dress, and then he almost passed out.
I'm dizzy, Hank.
I'm shaking like a leaf, man.
Is... is it possible I'm having a heart attack?
- Here, feel.
- Mm.
Mm-mm.
Maybe there's an underlying medical condition or something I don't even know about.
M-m-maybe I should go see a doctor.
Maybe we made a mistake here.
May... maybe Karen's right.
Maybe this isn't the way it's supposed to go down for me, you know?
Maybe I'm supposed to meet a nice girl and somehow sweet-talk her into letting me foul her.
You don't have to go through with this, you know, not at all.
You... you wouldn't be disappointed in me?
No way, never.
God, I'm so fucking lame, and you're such a fucking baller.
You are not lame in the slightest.
You're a bright, interesting kid, and you got a shitload of love in your heart.
I do.
You've made the past few weeks of my life very interesting.
- I'm happy to know you.
- Oh, thanks, Dad.
- All right.
- Aw, guys...
This is maybe one of the sweetest fucking things
I've ever seen.
But I have another appointment to get to.
So, if we're not gonna do this, then I'm just gonna grab my double-sided dildo, and I'm just gonna go.
What do you think?
What do you think?
- What do you think?
- I don't know.
Here's what I think.
Oh.
That's what she thinks.
So what's it gonna be?
Get the fuck out of here, okay?
Gone.
Oh, and if you find yourself getting too excited, just think about your grandfather and peeing in his colostomy bag, works like a charm.
Trust!
Hi.
What's going on?
Uh, well, Levon is losing his virginity to a hooker in the guest room right now.
Good for him.
Good for him.
- And who are you?
- He's the pimp.
Jesus Christ.
I handle the fucking money, and I keep her safe from creeps.
Don't be such a condescending prick.
He's the pimp?
Did you piss your pants or something?
Done deal.
Another happy customer.
Kid's got a sick fucking hog on him, by the way.
Hey, you're not supposed to get excited about their fucking cocks.
Well, what?
Some of them are better and nicer than others.
It's a fact.
I had such a fun time, sweetie!
Call me anytime.
Tweet me, whatever.
I will.
Definitely.
You definitely will not!
That shit's expensive.
Well, we offer a frequent-flyer discount.
Peace out, weirdos.
Bye, you honey!
Bye, Marcy.
Thank you.
Take me to bed, Runks.
I haven't been laid in so long,
I'm starting to feel like a born-again virgin.
I'm not feeling very amorous, Marcy.
My new client puked into my crotch tonight.
- Yeah, I can smell it.
- Have a seat, Harpo.
Ah, man.
- How you feeling?
- Amazing.
Amazing.
It's like my head is so fucking clear right now, you know?
It feel like I understand the relationship between shit in the universe a lot better.
I feel like I could honestly solve some of the world's bigger problems.
- You got the poison out.
- Yes.
Exactly.
Yeah.
How long's this feeling gonna last?
- About six or seven minutes.
- Shit.
Better enjoy it, then.
Oh, hey, that thing with my grandpa and the colostomy bag totally worked.
How'd you know he had a bag?
- What?
- You know how you tell your mother everything, you said?
Are you gonna tell her about this?
- No.
No fucking way.
- Okay.
Karen was right.
She would be totally pissed
- and think it was all fucking gross
- Yeah.
and misogynistic and shit.
Okay, well, that's good to know.
Yeah.
Hey, dad?
- Yeah?
- Thanks again.
This was truly an epic fucking night in the life, and I will never, ever forget it, obviously.
You're welcome.
You're welcome.
That's a wet one.
You better get me a kick-ass father's day gift.
Oh, you know I will.
In fact, I think I'm gonna book you some time with Nikki.
She did this thing with her vagina.
- It was talking to my dick.
- That's too much.
- Smell my fingers.
- Go to bed.
Okay.
♪ Well, he went out to dinner in his Sunday best ♪
♪ Excitable boy, they all said ♪
Where did we get out?
Good.
Did we liquidate everything?
Great.
Great result.
Yeah!
The Garner algorithm works.
Yeah.
No, no, the trip was good.
They were impressed with our trading results.
They're absolutely going to do some business with us.
They like metals.
Hey, look, can you make Thursday night?
I don't know.
It's for sick kids or horses or something.
What if they were Jewish horses?
What if they were Jewish horses with cancer?
Great.
Great.
Great, I'll tell Rachel.
Bye.
Rachel?
I'm home!
Is there anything to eat?
Rachel?
No!
No, no!

Go on, City!
Commodity Part 1 of 2
Come on, you Reds!
Thank you.
Mate, ready for you.
On y va.
Are you the one that's going to do it?
-Sorry?
-Rachel's my wife.
My son, my beautiful son, Nathan.
I don't want this.
This postmortem, I don't want it.
-I'm very sorry for your...
-I don't want people seeing them like this.
I don't want people looking at them.
Cutting them apart.
I don't want it!
But you do want them to have justice?
Hey, Mousa.
You OK?
Hope your boy does good today.
Mousa?
Hi, David.
Good food?
My client needs more love.
Oh, we all need more love, Mousa.
Two months ago you were calling me three times a day wanting to talk contract extension.
Two months?
Time flies, eh?
-Isaac doesn't feel appreciated.
-I know.
I've been meaning to talk to you, our new owners want to make some changes.
We're going to move Isaac on.
I come here to get him a new contract and you tell me he's out?
It's a tough business, Mousa.
He needs a new environment in order to reach his potential.
The fans will hate you.
I don't know, Mousa.
The fans are fickle.
Besides, they already hate me, which frankly
-makes my job easier.
-He has to agree the move.
I know.
I'm hoping you'll convince him.
-He doesn't want to go.
-Mousa, hear me.
He's playing his last game for us today.
The Twitter thing wasn't good.
Our new owners are from your part of the world.
-Leicester?
-You know what I mean.
Your client isn't popular in Riyadh.
He's popular when he scores goals.
Not any more.
-Cheer for Daddy!
-He did it, Mummy!
He did it!
He's not moving, David.
You break our contract, we'll get the FA in to sanction you.
-We'll take legal action.
-OK, Mousa, let's not get overexcited.
We both know that's not going to happen.
What we need to do is work together to get the best possible price for the transfer.
Your client's quite good at football, but he's an arsehole and we don't want to be associated with him.
Stop!
Stop!
Turn it off!
-Get up, you Jew bastard.
-What did you say?
What did you say?
Say that again.
Say that again!
You heard exactly what I said.
I didn't hear you, mate, I didn't hear you.
Off!
Can you get these to the lab, please?
Hello?
OK.
Text me the location.
Thanks.
-Forensic Pathologist?
-Nikki Alexander.
Very nice to meet you.
I'm Detective Inspector John Leighton.
-Hi.
-The body of the deceased is over here.
-Apparently it's a young woman.
-Have you been able to identify her?
No, unfortunately not yet.
Her face has been badly disfigured.
Who's the wing nut who put the blanket over the body?
Your forensic colleague is already here.
One of the constables felt it was wrong
-to just leave it for everyone -to see.
And you let him?
I saw the merit in it.
This is a crime scene.
I'm confused.
Are you meant to protect it or contaminate it?
Son, I'd be grateful if you'd adjust your attitude a little.
You'd be grateful?
You think I've come down here to win your gratitude?
Could we get a screen up, please, Detective Inspector?
Unbelievable.
You just ooze charm.
Well, it's going to be hard enough to get something - anything - that has forensic value, then they put an old blanket over the body?
!
What are you doing?
What?
Why are you breaking his balls?
-I'm not breaking his balls.
-You're breaking his balls.
What's wrong with you?
I hear all this chat for a year about how you don't want to be the boss and now, suddenly, you want to be the boss!
-I don't want to be the boss.
-Then why are you acting
-like you want to be the boss?
-You are so wrong.
Why am I wrong?
Because you're the boss?
We've got a job to do.
Can we just get on with it?
You don't think that sounded a wee bit bossy?
Jesus.
Put the blanket back down.
Yep.
You can train here until we find you a new club.
I don't want you to worry cos... we'll find you a better opportunity.
Nikki?
I used to love the smell of fresh-cut grass when I was a kid.
This kind of kills the nostalgia.
Isaac!
Isaac!
Can I have a photo with you, please?
Sure.
-Did you like the game?
-Yeah.
-Give me five.
-Isaac!
-You're my favourite player.
-Thanks, mate.
-What's your name?
-Mahmoud.
Yeah?
What's up, Mahmoud.
-Dad!
-Isaac!
Isaac!
-Isaac!
Isaac!
Can I have your autograph?
-Yeah, sure.
Rubbish trucks arrive and are emptied.
Body is dumped in the amenity, no-one sees it.
The claws mangled her body when they picked it up to deposit it on the barge.
Yeah, I can see that's what happened to her body.
What happened to her face?
Almost every sponsor's gone.
Shoes, clothes, watches...
no-one will renew.
All we've got left is underwear and that's because the owners are Jewish.
Sami, could you get me a coffee?
-Espresso?
Two sugars?
-Perfect, and make sure Isaac's OK.
He's a good boy.
How's he getting on?
He's getting on fine.
Helpful.
Thoughtful.
-A little quiet.
-He's shy.
He gets that from my sister.
Mousa, I'm worried that
-if you don't do something...
-Citroen?
He keeps the car to the end of the season,
-but they've killed the ad campaign.
-Don't say anything to Isaac.
-You think he doesn't know?
-Can we replace them?
Everyone knows he's being forced out of City because of what he said.
All the sponsors and ad buyers are talking to each other.
What he did on Twitter was like firebombing their brand.
-He didn't mean what he said.
-You don't joke about Mohammed.
Ever.
You don't mention religion.
You don't mention race.
The only thing he should be writing on Twitter is how much he loves the fans.
Yeah, I'd like to try and put a name to her as soon as possible.
I've had tissue sent for DNA.
We'll see if she's on the database.
-And if she isn't?
-It could be a struggle.
We're taking moulds of her teeth, although some were damaged.
We can try to identify her from the shape of her ear.
-You can do that?
-Yeah.
But we'll need to match it to something.
Do you have anything?
No.
No missing person reports.
Nothing found at the scene.
I'm relying on you.
-I'll speak to you tomorrow.
-OK.
Thanks.
-You got to the scene quickly.
-I wasn't far away.
-I had a couple of seats at the football.
-Who did you go with?
-Girl I met.
-Where?
-Pub.
-Liar.
-How did you know?
-You never complained.
If you had a date with a girl you met in a pub, you would be hopeful you might get lucky.
The call to attend would have crushed that hope.
You would complain.
You could have taken me.
-I didn't know you liked football.
-Why?
-Because I'm in a chair?
-Chip?
Shoulder?
Hello?
Yeah, OK.
I'll be there.
Thanks.
We need a list of every rubbish truck and driver that used
Smithy Environmental last night and this morning.
I get the best seats at the football when I go, and the carer goes free.
-Something to keep in mind?
-I'm not your carer.
Don't I know.
We normally only allow immediate family.
"Sister" isn't immediate enough?
Her husband didn't mention that she had a sister.
I was her sister long before she was married to him.
I'll be her sister... ..forever.
You can stay as long as you'd like.
Thank you.
She looks very peaceful.
They didn't... you know...
..assault her sexually.
-I'll give my report to the coroner.
-Did they rape my sister?
No.
How did they kill her?
Do the police have any idea who did this?
You should speak to them.
Actually I need to get back to work.
-I have a meeting.
-And Nathan?
How did they kill him?
Nathan has no marks on his body whatsoever.
His bloods contained a fatal amount of benzodiazepine and a very large amount of oxycodone.
We searched the house.
We didn't find any...
He died of a drug overdose?
A six-year-old?
Their son was autistic, apparently.
And?
Well, is benzodiazepine used to control autistic kids?
Well, it's used for quite a few things.
Did his mother kill him?
Is that what this is?
Murder-suicide?
You know, she's sick of him.
She's sick of her life.
Gives him too much of the drugs.
Remorse kicks in.
You read about this a lot.
And then she can't live with what she's done.
Single gunshot wound to the head.
I found firearms residue on her hands and clothes.
Well, then, there's no question.
Well, it doesn't mean, in and of itself, that she fired the gun.
It was an enclosed space so there'll be residue throughout the room.
Maybe the overdose was accidental.
I mean, she saw no way out.
Shall we just go through what we know?
The entry point is here and it took
-very little...
-Doesn't this affect you?
It took very little of the front of her head away.
Has your forensics team found the slug?
No.
It wasn't in the bone of the skull?
No.
Then no.
Not yet.
There was no sign of forced entry on the ground floor.
There was a window broken in the bedroom.
It could have been the point of entry but the glass fell on the outside.
Mr. Freedman says he has no knowledge of it.
Why isn't the Lyell Centre doing the forensics?
I heard things about your man.
Leave it.
Have you found a gun?
No.
If Rachel was responsible, where was the gun?
Husband comes home, he discovers bodies, is horrified.
He can't accept that his wife might have done that, so... takes the gun, disposes of it.
And then he breaks a window to make it look like someone broke in.
Most victims know their killers.
You've ruled out her husband?
How long do you think they were dead?
More than 36 hours.
Rigor had passed, putrefaction had begun.
Mr. Freedman was away on a business trip.
Why did he tell me that he didn't want a postmortem?
Well, he loved his wife.
He didn't want her body...
-you know.
-She's dead.
His alibi stands up.
I mean, it could have been a burglary, but home invasion is very rare.
-She wasn't sexually assaulted?
-No.
Based on the entry wound, could she have pulled the trigger?
Yes, but someone else could have as well, so it's...
You'll have the full postmortem for me soon?
Has her sister spoken to you?
No.
Well, she came to see the bodies.
Anxious to know if we knew how she died or whether we had any idea who'd done it.
Just seemed odd to ask me rather than ask you.
Haven't identified the body.
Face and fingertips were burnt away by acid.
Might know something later.
Bye.
Anne?
-John!
-How are you?
-I'm fine.
How are you?
-I'm good.
You look absolutely great.
-You look good.
Are you well?
-I was thinking about you.
Yeah, I was asking around about you actually.
-Everything OK?
-Yeah.
Fine!
I heard you got your promotion.
I hope you're not working too hard.
Well, you know.
-Are you still with...?
-No.
Well, yes and no, but mostly no.
-And you?
-I'm...
Yep, same.
-See you.
-Yeah, see you around.
Bugger.
Nikki?
Nikki, have you seen this press release?
I saw it.
Is it wrong to like things that are familiar?
It's not wrong, is it?
My life has too many moving parts.
It squeaks.
My life?
-The chair.
-Yep.
Needs oil to run smooth.
Now we're talking about my life.
-Still the chair.
-It's funny how the oddest things can remind you of someone.
I don't want anything in this room to change.
It already has.
When did it arrive?
This morning.
Mousa?
I need to see you.
You're making me so hot.
You come that way out of the box, baby.
Come on.
For Mousa?
-How much does she want?
-120.
For a sex tape?
His value goes up if she sticks it on the net.
In the note that came with it, it says she has footage where he beats the woman up...
-for fun!
-Beats her up?
Not really the family man your sponsors love, is he?
Can I just say, I don't believe my client
-was involved in...
-He makes jokes about religion, then he beats up a woman during sex.
This will wipe out his transfer value.
If people find out about this, we'll never find him another club.
Isaac Dreyfus is toxic!
My Chairman thinks that what Dreyfus has done is no different than stealing from him.
-What can I do?
-What can you do?
I'll tell you what you do.
You pay her the 120 grand and you find him another club.
Morning.
Morning, Papa.
How are you?
I am very well.
Grande forme.
Come on in French, Zara - comment ca va?
Comment ca va?
-Grande forme.
-Grande forme.
Mousa's looking for a new club.
It's my own fault.
Where?
In England?
France, Germany...
It won't be the Middle East.
What about Zara's school?
What about the nanny?
I was going to hire one this week.
They don't stay very long anyway.
Papa!
Papa!
Regarde ce que j'ai fait!
Tres beau, Zara!
C'est magnifique!
-C'est qui?
-C'est moi!
Unidentified young woman.
Caucasian.
Mid to late 20s.
Ligature marks around the circumference of the neck over the thyroid prominence.
Thanks.
Can we photograph the hands?
Thanks.
Thank you.
-Cocaine?
-Calcium carbonate.
Does that look like a type of ryegrass to you?
Jack, does it look as though my life has had much to do with grass?
Can you send samples over for genetic tests?
The clippings look to be a mix of different types.
And check what kind of grass they use in public parks.
Skips?
They look as though they're confined to the South East.
No hard-and-fast rule, but most of the drivers use Smithy Environmental Services when they collect in that area.
I'm isolating the lorries that delivered first thing that morning.
And look at the last deliveries the night before as well.
Did you think I wouldn't?
-Their rubbish went out on the midnight barge that night.
-You're sure?
Why don't you trust me, Jack?
The hob was on...
There was a pan out, butter in it.
I went upstairs.
She wasn't there so I went to check on Nathan.
I've told you all this over and over.
Why would I want flowers?
Why do they send them?
Give the money to a charity.
You weren't worried you hadn't heard from her?
I was gone for three days.
I left messages.
-She knew I was busy.
-Did she have trouble coping with your son?
What are you talking about?
Nathan was no trouble.
He might have been a little slower and quiet, but they were joined at the hip.
We found firearms residue on her hand.
-Do you own a firearm?
-Absolutely not.
Be ashamed of yourself for thinking that.
Be ashamed.
She loved our son.
They hear the word "autism", I know people think like that, but shame on you.
You don't like that, do you?
-No.
-You don't get it.
You see, I think it's beautiful.
Rachel thought it was beautiful.
We look at Nathan and we don't see what you see.
We get him.
We think he's beautiful.
Maybe your wife was overly tired.
No.
Did she have help?
We had au pairs, nannies, whatever you want to call them, to help with Nathan.
But none of them stayed very long.
They couldn't cope, I guess.
The last one quit after a few weeks.
-And Rachel could cope?
-Yes.
She could cope.
She loved our son.
She loved him.
She coped.
How often did her sister help her?
Rachel doesn't have a sister.
Hello.
Can I help you?
You weren't really asking if you could help, were you?
-Not really.
-You were asking,
-"What are you doing in this office?"
-Yeah.
I'm asking the same thing, but... probably without the same sort of edge.
Thomas Chamberlain.
Consultant Forensic Pathologist.
Jack Hodgson.
You're the new gaffer?
I saw the press release.
You're coming in to, what was it, "restore confidence in the centre".
I didn't know we'd lost anyone's confidence.
-I didn't write it.
-Course not.
Hodgson...?
What are you?
Forensic science.
Been at the Lyell Centre 15 months and accounted for 27% of its profits.
If you say so.
Hello.
Clarissa Mullery, this is Thomas Chamberlain.
Hello, Clarissa.
Hmm.
What are you?
Are you kidding me?
Do you know how offensive that is?
-No, not particularly, no.
-You're that insensitive?
=I don't consider myself insensitive.
-"What are you?"!
-Do you think I'm some sort of monster?
-I'm beginning to.
Clarissa works with me.
Forensic Examiner.
That's what she is.
That is what I do.
That is not who I am.
Two separate things.
I am what I do.
That must make it easier to keep track
- of...
-Clarissa Mullery.
You are "insightful, analytical,
"and your perspicacity is
"fundamental to the success of the Forensic Science team."
-Who told you that?
-End-of-year assessment.
-You said that?
-I didn't mean it.
I'm confident the torso disfigurement was a result of the lifting claw.
The disfigurement of her face and hands are a consequence of hydrochloric acid.
-To prevent identification?
-I can't tell you the motive, but it could suggest that it was a murder with forethought.
I think that a plastic bag was put over the victim's head - the marks are where it was tied.
And I observed small pinpoints, haemorrhages within the sclera of the eyes, which may be suggestive of asphyxia.
However, I don't think that she was dead when the acid was poured on her face.
The raised red lines around the acid burns... as well as evidence of acid burns in her mouth, throat, oesophagus and airways, suggest that she was still alive when the acid was thrown in her face,
and she was gasping for breath.
-How could they do this?
-Practically or morally?
Practically
- I think that she was drugged and then murdered.
The fluid in her stomach had a high diazepine concentration.
I think that the drug was dissolved in fluid and then ingested.
So she was knocked out, strangled, disfigured.
I haven't had the bloods back but I'm expecting them today.
Morally?
Well, there is no answer, is there?
I will do everything that I can to help you get the person or people who did this,
-and bring them to justice.
-She was drugged?
-Yes.
-Was she raped?
-No.
-No?
Then why?
Why?
Why would they?
You know the world's a desperate, tragic place when the fact she wasn't raped is scarier than if she was.
-Dra.
Alexander?
-Yes.
Sorry to disturb you.
-Thomas Chamberlain?
-That's right.
I'm replacing Professor Dalton.
No, you're not.
You're taking over from him.
Well, actually, I'm, er, I'm taking over from you.
I didn't want the job, but if you want to say that you're taking over, if it makes you feel better, then fine.
Knock yourself out.
I saw the press release.
-We're not getting off to a good start.
-No?
The whole team seems to have some sort of a passive-aggressive thing going on.
It must be very difficult to work together.
-We don't seem to struggle.
-It's just me.
-It was that word "replace".
-I need to shower and get changed.
It wasn't the right word.
Perhaps we could talk about it later?
Unless you're intending to stay here and perv.
That was not an invitation.
Yes.
Yes, I got that.
I'm sensitive.
Isaac.
Hi.
Hey!
Come on in.
It's a great strike, and that's a fantastic goal.
-Isaac?
-You need to speak to the people who make this, Mousa.
I'm much faster than this!
I'm as fast as Bale or Walcott.
Right?
Go on, go on.
I mean, seriously, you've got to get them to fix that.
They're disrespecting me, man!
Isaac!
I was about to score.
Jack?
Can you have a look at the lot number and serial number on these?
We can check them against the EU Register and find out who they belonged to.
See you.
Yo.
You know Ron McNally from the club?
Yeah.
You helped us with that Twitter stuff, right?
-I tried.
-Yeah!
I had like maybe 15,000 death threats.
-Yeah.
That was funny.
-Yeah.
Own goal, wasn't it?
I don't know where my brain was on that one.
Must have been the steroids I was taking.
Just messing with you, Mo!
I don't take that shit.
Makes your bollocks shrink and turns you into a monster.
Where's Monica?
Interviewing nannies.
Yeah, the last one quit.
She's... she's picking an ugly one for me.
What?
What is it, Mo?
You have a DVD player?
Serial Number:
FR34728.
Lot Number: 10-15-90.
And the lot number is 10-15-90.
We're looking for the name of the patient who received the implants.
The Lyell Centre.
London.
Oui.
Un moment.
Nikki!
Dr. Chamberlain?
European Register of Prostheses.
They want to speak to a doctor.
They're French.
Oui.
Allô?
Thomas Chamberlain, Docteur de pathologie.
Vous avez le nom.
À oui, un moment.
Eva Liron.
-How much does she want?
-She wants 120,000.
-Is she crazy?
-Do you know her?
You saw the tape?
Of course.
She was an au pair.
120,000?
Don't be so stupid.
The note says she has footage where you beat the woman up.
Yeah?
Then show me!
I've never beat up a woman.
-Never.
-I think you should pay.
-You don't believe me?
-They can do things to videos.
And next week, hmm?
How much will it be next week?
-150?
200?
-We're trying to get you a new club.
-We've lost almost every sponsor.
-Then what?
Miss a penalty?
Get sent off?
For a sex tape?
Never.
Beating up women doesn't raise your value in the market.
There's no tape of me beating up a woman.
Do you want to take a chance?
There's no tape of me beating up a woman because I never did.
Tu comprend ca?
Never.
You know I don't care about these things, Isaac.
-I really don't.
-Hey, Mo, why aren't you asking if the club is doing this to get rid of me?
-That's what you should be asking.
-That's ridiculous!
The club wants to get rid of me and suddenly...
-..this shows up.
-Nobody wants
-to see your value drop, Isaac.
-This is because of the Twitter.
-This is the payback.
-I'm not going to listen to this.
-Ron, wait!
-Maybe they knock women around in Riyadh.
-I don't care if...
-Maybe that's how they get off.
-I don't do that!
-What you do is your business.
Just get out of my house.
All of you.
Get out!
Are you OK?
Yeah.
I'm fine.
Everything's fine.
That sofa's to go.
A couple of smaller sofas here...
Rachel Freedman doesn't have a sister.
Who was the woman that came to see her?
She called herself Ruth.
That's all we've got.
Why would she come here?
To get information.
Well, how would she find out where Rachel's and Nathan's bodies were being kept?
Adam Freedman?
She asked him?
She followed him.
We're working from the theory that Eva Liron's body was transported to the amenity site by a rubbish truck.
Or a skip.
I think it was a skip.
Yeah, could be either.
Both use Smithy Environmental.
-It was a skip.
-The rubbish trucks in this area
-won't collect garden waste.
-The public parks use skips.
-The amount of organic material...
-Organic material?
-Grass.
-Right.
..makes me think that it must have come from a large open space, not a private garden.
Eva's body was in a skip covered by grass,
-which prevented its discovery.
-And possibly masked any odour that could have alerted someone to its presence.
So you think the deceased died in a public park?
No.
Clarissa?
This is the approximate catchment area for Smithy Environmental.
There are more than 40 open spaces that we estimate could account for the volume of grass we saw at Smithy Environmental.
We had to find a way to narrow the location.
How did we do that, Clarissa?
-We looked at the grass.
-Were we surprised?
We were surprised.
We found that the grass we sampled was a blend of?
Bizet perennial ryegrass,
Verdi perennial ryegrass and Limousine smooth-stalked meadow grass.
And this combination of grasses is used for?
Professional sports pitches.
-Not parks?
-No.
And we found another substance on the blades of grass.
-A white substance.
-Calcium carbonate, which is...
The white chalk they use to line a pitch.
We checked the list of skips that had been delivered on the morning the body was found, and discovered that a skip came from?
Duchess Meadows.
-And what is in Duchess Meadows?
-You're just showing off.
It's where City have their training ground.
You're a City fan?
Since I was a boy!
-Hey, Lucy.
-Isaac!
-Sami, you all right?
-Hi.
I need to speak to Mo.
Hi.
Come in.
Pay her.
Hi, it's Nikki.
Bloods on the child, Nathan Freedman.
Could you run them again, please?
We can get a fresh sample to you.
I'd prefer that.
Eliminate any possibility of contamination.
Isaac would like to pay what they want to make this go away.
They gave you details of how to make the transaction?
Your son was difficult to control.
He didn't react well to strangers.
He hit out at them?
Yeah, and might try to bite them if he was very, very scared.
And to you?
He was never very, very scared?
Did you use any kinds of drugs to try and calm him down?
No.
No benzodiazepines?
Painkillers?
-No!
-Well, just to take the edge off him?
Are you mad?
Would you give your child drugs to calm them down or shut them up
-because you couldn't cope?
-I don't have children.
Which explains the stupidity of your question.
-Detective Inspector.
-Mr.
McNally.
-Nice to meet you.
-I asked Bazza Numan, one of our groundsman, to join us.
This way.
25 years with the police, I was.
Can't say I enjoyed every one of them, but...
I am proud of them.
-How often do you cut the grass?
-Every day.
Training ground and stadium.
Sometimes two or three days if it's been raining.
Doesn't grow so fast in the winter.
-And you put it in the skip there?
-Yep.
That's the way they want it done.
Is the gate normally locked?
If the skip pick-up is very early in the morning, they'll...
They'll leave it open.
-CCTV?
-Not here.
Training ground, player areas - of course.
But...
here?
"Muriatic."
It's just another name for hydrochloric acid, isn't it?
I don't know, sir.
-What do you use it for?
-Clean the cement.
Gets rid of grime.
You have to wear gloves.
May I speak with Dra.
Alexander, please?
Hi.
Sorry to trouble you.
Do you know this woman?
No, sorry.
Could this have disfigured Eva Liron?
The same chemical.
Undiluted, it would be capable of inflicting the injuries we've seen.
Hi.
Sorry to trouble you, Mr. Dreyfus.
Would you mind signing this?
For my daughter.
Yeah, sure.
-Thanks.
Really appreciate it, mate.
-You're welcome.
Erm...
Do you know this woman?
-Why?
What happened?
-She was murdered.
No.
I'm sorry.
I don't know her.
Bye.
The clippings are so fine, the body sinks, gets covered by fertilisers, nitrates - you know the sort of stuff, snail killer...
And it's in a confined space.
The chemicals in the grass will change the rate of decomposition of the body.
Grass will insulate, but it'll also produce its own heat.
Which could speed things up and cause burns and charring.
But if there's not enough air then it will slow the process.
We're really pinning this down!
Hi.
Erm, sorry to trouble you, Carlos.
-Do you know this woman?
-Si.
She used to work for Isaac.
Eva Liron's dead.
Dead?
-How did she...?
-She was murdered.
My God.
I...
I have to call Isaac.
-Where is your husband?
-He should be home soon.
My God.
Is that...
Is that Isaac Dreyfus?
-I have to see Mousa.
-Hey, Isaac.
He's not here.
-Where is he?
-I don't know...
Sami?
At a meeting?
-Have you tried to call him?
-He's not answering his phone!
I'll...
let him know, yeah?
She was highly recommended.
Her references were very good.
I...
I liked her very much.
And then she just disappeared.
It was strange.
She seemed happy.
I tried to contact her, but she never answered her phone.
-She just disappeared.
-Why didn't you call the police?
To say what?
"Our nanny quit"?
I couldn't even get the police to come when I thought someone broke into our house.
You OK?
Yes!
Sorry, I had to collect Zara.
Mama!
-Police?
-Detective Inspector John Leighton.
-City fan?
-Nope.
-Dommage.
-I prefer rugby.
Are you OK to answer a few questions?
Sweetie, why don't you go upstairs and play, OK?
When did you last see Eva Liron?
Ten days ago?
Yeah, just...
Just before the match in Newcastle.
-And you have a clear memory of it?
-Yeah, of course.
Imean,
Monica panicked when Eva didn't show up for work.
My wife had never been to Newcastle before and she was going to go with me.
But she couldn't come.
No idea who would have wanted to do her harm?
No.
OK.
Thank you.
Forensics believe that her body was dumped at the training ground.
That's why we were there today and why we were asking people if they'd seen Eva or knew who she was.
Why did you pretend not to know her?
Well, because it made me look guilty and...
I'm not guilty.
Yeah, of course.
Do we need a solicitor?
-No.
No.
-Should I call my father?
Don't worry.
We'll be good.
Are you coming to bed?
I slept with her.
I slept with Eva.
I slept with her and she made a tape.
She was trying to get money from me.
I'm sorry.
How could you do this to us?
How could you be so weak?
!
-In my bed?
-No.
A hotel.
An away match.
She followed you to a match?
!
-Did you...?
-No!
Of course not!
I-I didn't know she was dead until today.
I was going to pay her...
Monica!
You have to believe me!
Baby...
-Do you love me?
-Oui.
I'm sorry.
Nice.
Every girl should have one.
Every girl secretly wants to be a WAG.
Yeah.
Why wouldn't you?
Let your whole existence be defined by a bloke.
Excuse me, please.
Come in.
Well, what do you think?
I think it's...
amazing and marks you out as a man of incredible taste and vision.
-Do you think she meant that?
-Absolutely.
Right.
Do you think Isaac Dreyfus has anything to do with it?
I need evidence.
I need motive.
How many nannies do you know with a...?
Breast augmentation.
That just trips off the tongue.
How many?
-What's your point?
-There isn't always one.
-You think Eva Liron targeted him?
-OK.
She pursues him.
Probably just for fun at first.
She gets him to sleep with her.
She decides, "That was easy." "I'd like the rest of that lifestyle as well."
He says, "No".
She threatens to blow up his life.
-He kills her.
-A bleak world-view.
He's 26, right?
For each one of those years, he's been told he's marvellous, special.
He doesn't know what's right or wrong.
He just does.
-Although the cliche is attractive...
-It's a cliche because we all know it happens.
Now, his window of opportunity is limited because he travels so much.
So I need you to be very precise about Eva Liron's time of death.
Trying to estimate her time of death won't be easy.
She will have died at least a week ago.
There are no fly eggs on the body and there is evidence of putrefaction, marbling along blood vessels...
Can we get within a day?
I need to be able to limit any alibi...
A day is fairly exact...
Oh, we should be able to do that.
We presume that she was murdered at the training ground, but we don't know.
The environment in the skip is moist, but we don't know how long it was in the skip.
The acid will have caused a rise in temperature...
We can play with the information we've got and give the Detective Inspector what he needs, can't we?
You have the skills and resources, don't you, Dra.
Alexander?
I'll be at my desk.
Magistrate's given us a warrant to search his house.
-Thanks for your time.
-Thank you.
Jack?
Did I say something...?
She doesn't "play with information" and she doesn't lie.
Asking if she "had the skills"?
You're lucky you can still pee standing up.
Great leadership, by the way.
Restored my confidence.
-What's going on?
-Morning, Mrs. Dreyfus.
I have a warrant to search your house.
Sergio, you take upstairs.
Peter, in there.
James, Eddie - kitchen.
Come on!
Why are you doing this?
Why?
-Monica.
-Zara, come on.
Let's watch TV, OK?
Mousa!
?
Where are you?
The police are here searching my house.
Call me back.
You're just trying to make yourself famous.
-Is that what it is?
-Yeah, it was always my dream.
C'est pour moi, tout ça?
-Hey!
Stop it!
-Detective Leighton!
Can you...?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Detective Leighton, you need to see this.
I didn't kill her.
Are you listening?
I didn't kill her.
Monica, call your father!
Isaac!
Isaac!
You know each other?
-Yep.
-Yeah.
I needed to see both of you.
His father says they didn't use drugs.
Some families don't.
He admitted that Nathan could be violent and strike out at strangers.
Well, I don't think that the presence of benzodiazepine in Nathan's bloods has anything to do with his autism.
The cocktail of anti-psychotic drugs and painkillers used to kill Nathan Freedman is the same as those found in the bloods of Eva Liron.
It may not mean anything, but it is highly unusual.
I can't explain it, but...
I think you may be looking for the same killer.
Well, we've already got a suspect.
Mousa Rashid's dead.
I'm not all the things you think I am.
-I didn't kill the girl.
-I'm not the one who'll judge you.
Please!
I don't know what to do.
I'm so scared.
I need more physical evidence.
I need you two to step up.
-How have we not stepped up?
-Leighton called.
-Says Jack assaulted him.
-What?
She allows herself to be photographed but leaves no DNA and no prints.
Someone went through my files and photocopied a highly confidential document.
And you think that was me?

Where did we get out?
Good.
Did we liquidate everything?
Great.
Great result.
Yeah!
The Garner algorithm works.
Yeah.
No, no, the trip was good.
They were impressed with our trading results.
They're absolutely going to do some business with us.
They like metals.

Oh, I don't know.
It's for sick kids or horses or something.

Are you the one that's going to do it?
Sorry?
Rachel's my wife.
My son, my beautiful son, Nathan.
I don't want this.
This postmortem, I don't want it.
I'm very sorry for your...
I don't want people seeing them like this.
I don't want people looking at them.
Cutting them apart.
I don't want it!
But you do want them to have justice?
MAN AND WOMAN SPEAK IN YIDDISH
Hey, Mousa.
You OK?
Hope your boy does good today.
Mousa?
Hi, David.
Good food?
Hmmm.
My client needs more love.
Oh, we all need more love, Mousa.
Two months ago you were calling me three times a day wanting to talk contract extension.
Two months?
Time flies, eh?
Isaac doesn't feel appreciated.
I know.
I've been meaning to talk to you, our new owners want to make some changes.
We're going to move Isaac on.
I come here to get him a new contract and you tell me he's out?
It's a tough business, Mousa.
'He needs a new environment in order to reach his potential.'
'The fans will hate you.'
'Oh, I don't know, Mousa.
The fans are fickle.'
'Besides, they already hate me, which frankly makes my job easier.'
'He has to agree the move.'
'I know.
I'm hoping you'll convince him.'
'He doesn't want to go.'
'Mousa, hear me.'
He's playing his last game for us today.
The Twitter thing wasn't good.
Our new owners are from your part of the world.
Leicester?
You know what I mean.
Your client isn't popular in Riyadh.
'He's popular when he scores goals.'
'Not any more.'
Cheer for Daddy!
He did it, Mummy!
He did it!
He's not moving, David.
You break our contract, we'll get the FA in to sanction you.
We'll take legal action.
OK, Mousa, let's not get overexcited.
We both know that's not going to happen.
What we need to do is work together to get the best possible price for the transfer.
Your client's quite good at football, but he's an arsehole and we don't want to be associated with him.
Stop!
Stop!
Turn it off!
Get up, you Jew bastard.
What did you say?
What did you say?
Say that again.
Say that again!
You heard exactly what I said.
I didn't hear you, mate, I didn't hear you.
Off!

PHONE RINGS Can you get these to the lab, please?
Hello?
OK.
Text me the location.
Thanks.
Forensic Pathologist?
Nikki Alexander.
Very nice to meet you.
I'm Detective Inspector John Leighton.
Hi.
The body of the deceased is over here.
Apparently it's a young woman.
Have you been able to identify her?
No, unfortunately not yet.
Her face has been badly disfigured.
Who's the wing nut who put the blanket over the body?
Your forensic colleague is already here.
One of the constables felt it was wrong to just leave it for everyone to see.
And you let him?
I saw the merit in it.
This is a crime scene.
I'm confused.
Are you meant to protect it or contaminate it?
Son, I'd be grateful if you'd adjust your attitude a little.
You'd be grateful?
You think I've come down here to win your gratitude?
Could we get a screen up, please, Detective Inspector?
Unbelievable.
You just ooze charm.
Well, it's going to be hard enough to get something - anything - that has forensic value, then they put an old blanket over the body?
!
What are you doing?
What?
Why are you breaking his balls?
I'm not breaking his balls.
You're breaking his balls.
What's wrong with you?
I hear all this chat for a year about how you don't want to be the boss and now, suddenly, you want to be the boss!
I don't want to be the boss.
Then why are you acting like you want to be the boss?
Oh, you are so wrong.
Why am I wrong?
Because you're the boss?
We've got a job to do.
Can we just get on with it?
You don't think that sounded a wee bit bossy?
Oh!
Jesus.
Put the blanket back down.
Yep.
You can train here until we find you a new club.
I don't want you to worry cos... we'll find you a better opportunity.
Nikki?
I used to love the smell of fresh-cut grass when I was a kid.
This kind of kills the nostalgia.
Isaac!
Isaac!
Can I have a photo with you, please?
Sure.
Did you like the game?
Yeah.
Give me five.
Isaac!
You're my favourite player.
Thanks, mate.
What's your name?
Mahmoud.
Yeah?
What's up, Mahmoud.
Dad!
Isaac!
Isaac!
Isaac!
Isaac!
Can I have your autograph?
Yeah, sure.
Rubbish trucks arrive and are emptied.
Body is dumped in the amenity, no-one sees it.
The claws mangled her body when they picked it up to deposit it on the barge.
Yeah, I can see that's what happened to her body.
What happened to her face?
Almost every sponsor's gone.
Shoes, clothes, watches...
no-one will renew.
All we've got left is underwear and that's because the owners are Jewish.
Sami, could you get me a coffee?
Espresso?
Two sugars?
Perfect, and make sure Isaac's OK.
He's a good boy.
How's he getting on?
He's getting on fine.
Helpful.
Thoughtful.
A little quiet.
He's shy.
He, er, gets that from my sister.
Mousa, I'm worried that if you don't do something...
Citroen?
He keeps the car to the end of the season, but they've killed the ad campaign.
Don't say anything to Isaac.
You think he doesn't know?
Can we replace them?
Everyone knows he's being forced out of City because of what he said.
All the sponsors and ad buyers are talking to each other.
What he did on Twitter was like firebombing their brand.
He didn't mean what he said.
You don't joke about Mohammed.
Ever.
You don't mention religion.
You don't mention race.
The only thing he should be writing on Twitter is how much he loves the fans.
Yeah, I'd like to try and put a name to her as soon as possible.
I've had tissue sent for DNA.
We'll see if she's on the database.
And if she isn't?
It could be a struggle.
We're taking moulds of her teeth, although some were damaged.
We can try to identify her from the shape of her ear.
You can do that?
Yeah.
But we'll need to match it to something.
Do you have anything?
No.
No missing person reports.
Nothing found at the scene.
I'm relying on you.
I'll speak to you tomorrow.
OK.
Thanks.
You got to the scene quickly.
I wasn't far away.
I had a couple of seats at the football.
Who did you go with?
Girl I met.
Where?
Pub.
Liar.
How did you know?
You never complained.
If you had a date with a girl you met in a pub, you would be hopeful you might get lucky.
The call to attend would have crushed that hope.
You would complain.
PHONE RINGS
You could have taken me.
I didn't know you liked football.
Why?
Because I'm in a chair?
Chip?
Shoulder?
THEY LAUGH
Hello?
Yeah, OK.
I'll be there.
Thanks.
We need a list of every rubbish truck and driver that used Smithy Environmental last night and this morning.
I get the best seats at the football when I go, and the carer goes free.
Something to keep in mind?
I'm not your carer.
Don't I know.
We normally only allow immediate family.
"Sister" isn't immediate enough?
Her husband didn't mention that she had a sister.
I was her sister long before she was married to him.
I'll be her sister... ..forever.
You can stay as long as you'd like.
Thank you.
She looks very peaceful.
They didn't... you know...
..assault her sexually.
I'll give my report to the coroner.
Did they rape my sister?
No.
How did they kill her?
Do the police have any idea who did this?
You should speak to them.
Actually I need to get back to work.
I have a meeting.
And Nathan?
How did they kill him?
Nathan has no marks on his body whatsoever.
His bloods contained a fatal amount of benzodiazepine and a very large amount of oxycodone.
We searched the house.
We didn't find any...
He died of a drug overdose?
A six-year-old?
Their son was autistic, apparently.
And?
Well, is benzodiazepine used to control autistic kids?
Well, it's used for quite a few things.
Ah!
Did his mother kill him?
Is that what this is?
Murder-suicide?
You know, she's sick of him.
She's sick of her life.
Gives him too much of the drugs.
Remorse kicks in.
You read about this a lot.
And then she can't live with what she's done.
Single gunshot wound to the head.
I found firearms residue on her hands and clothes.
Well, then, there's no question.
Well, it doesn't mean, in and of itself, that she fired the gun.
It was an enclosed space so there'll be residue throughout the room.
Maybe the overdose was accidental.
I mean, she saw no way out.
Shall we just go through what we know?
The entry point is here and it took very little...
Doesn't this affect you?
It took very little of the front of her head away.
Has your forensics team found the slug?
No.
It wasn't in the bone of the skull?
No.
Then no.
Not yet.
There was no sign of forced entry on the ground floor.
There was a window broken in the bedroom.
It could have been the point of entry but the glass fell on the outside.
Mr Freedman says he has no knowledge of it.
Why isn't the Lyell Centre doing the forensics?
I heard things about your man.
Leave it.
Have you found a gun?
No.
If Rachel was responsible, where was the gun?
Husband comes home, he discovers bodies, is horrified.
He can't accept that his wife might have done that, so... takes the gun, disposes of it.
And then he breaks a window to make it look like someone broke in.
Most victims know their killers.
You've ruled out her husband?
How long do you think they were dead?
More than 36 hours.
Rigor had passed, putrefaction had begun.
Mr Freedman was away on a business trip.
Why did he tell me that he didn't want a postmortem?
Well, he loved his wife.
He didn't want her body... you know.
She's dead.
His alibi stands up.
I mean, it could have been a burglary, but home invasion is very rare.
She wasn't sexually assaulted?
No.
Based on the entry wound, could she have pulled the trigger?
Yes, but someone else could have as well, so it's...
You'll have the full postmortem for me soon?
Has her sister spoken to you?
No.
Well, she came to see the bodies.
Anxious to know if we knew how she died or whether we had any idea who'd done it.
Just seemed odd to ask me rather than ask you.
Haven't identified the body.
Face and fingertips were burnt away by acid.
Might know something later.
Bye.
Anne?
John!
How are you?
I'm fine.
How are you?
I'm good.
You look absolutely great.
You look good.
Are you well?
I was thinking about you.
Yeah, I was asking around about you actually.
Everything OK?
Yeah.
Fine!
I heard you got your promotion.
I hope you're not working too hard.
Well, you know.
Are you still with, er...?
No.
Well, yes and no, but mostly no.
And you?
I'm, er...
Yep, same.
See you.
Yeah, see you around.
Bugger.
Nikki?
Nikki, have you seen this press release?
I saw it.
CHAIR SQUEAKS
Is it wrong to like things that are familiar?
It's not wrong, is it?
My life has too many moving parts.
It squeaks.
My life?
The chair.
Yep.
Needs oil to run smooth.
Now we're talking about my life.
Still the chair.
It's funny how the oddest things can remind you of someone.
I don't want anything in this room to change.
It already has.
When did it arrive?
This morning.
Mousa?
I need to see you.
You're making me so hot.
You come that way out of the box, baby.
Come on.
For Mousa?
Mm-hmm.
How much does she want?
120.
For a sex tape?
His value goes up if she sticks it on the net.
In the note that came with it, it says she has footage where he beats the woman up... for fun!
Beats her up?
Not really the family man your sponsors love, is he?
Can I just say, I don't believe my client was involved in...
He makes jokes about religion, then he beats up a woman during sex.
This will wipe out his transfer value.
If people find out about this, we'll never find him another club.
Isaac Dreyfus is toxic!
My Chairman thinks that what Dreyfus has done is no different than stealing from him.
What can I do?
What can you do?
I'll tell you what you do.
You pay her the 120 grand and you find him another club.
(Morning.)
Morning, Papa.
How are you?
I am very well.
Grande forme.
Come on in French, Zara - comment ca va?
Comment ca va?
Grande forme.
Grande forme.
THEY LAUGH
Mousa's looking for a new club.
It's my own fault.
Where?
In England?
France, Germany...
It won't be the Middle East.
What about Zara's school?
What about the nanny?
I was going to hire one this week.
They don't stay very long anyway.
Papa!
Papa!
Regarde ce que j'ai fait!
Tres beau, Zara!
C'est magnifique!
C'est qui?
C'est moi!
Unidentified young woman.
Caucasian.
Mid to late 20s.
Ligature marks around the circumference of the neck over the thyroid prominence.
Thanks.
'Can we photograph the hands?
Thanks.'
Thank you.
Cocaine?
Calcium carbonate.
Does that look like a type of ryegrass to you?
Jack, does it look as though my life has had much to do with grass?
Can you send samples over for genetic tests?
The clippings look to be a mix of different types.
And check what kind of grass they use in public parks.
Skips?
They look as though they're confined to the South East.
No hard-and-fast rule, but most of the drivers use Smithy Environmental Services when they collect in that area.
I'm isolating the lorries that delivered first thing that morning.
And look at the last deliveries the night before as well.
Did you think I wouldn't?
Their rubbish went out on the midnight barge that night.
You're sure?
Why don't you trust me, Jack?
The hob was on...
There was a pan out, butter in it.
I went upstairs.
She wasn't there so I went to check on Nathan.
I've told you all this over and over.
Why would I want flowers?
Why do they send them?
Give the money to a charity.
You weren't worried you hadn't heard from her?
I was gone for three days.
I left messages.
She knew I was busy.
Did she have trouble coping with your son?
What are you talking about?
Nathan was no trouble.
He might have been a little slower and quiet, but they were joined at the hip.
We found firearms residue on her hand.
Do you own a firearm?
Absolutely not.
Be ashamed of yourself for thinking that.
Be ashamed.
She loved our son.
They hear the word "autism", I know people think like that, but shame on you.
You don't like that, do you?
No.
You don't get it.
You see, I think it's beautiful.
Rachel thought it was beautiful.
We look at Nathan and we don't see what you see.
We get him.
We think he's beautiful.
Maybe your wife was overly tired.
No.
Did she have help?
We had au pairs, nannies, whatever you want to call them, to help with Nathan.
But none of them stayed very long.
They couldn't cope, I guess.
The last one quit after a few weeks.
And Rachel could cope?
Yes.
She could cope.
She loved our son.
She loved him.
She coped.
How often did her sister help her?
Rachel doesn't have a sister.
Hello.
Can I help you?
HE LAUGHS
You weren't really asking if you could help, were you?
Not really.
You were asking, "What are you doing in this office?"
Yeah.
I'm asking the same thing, but, er, probably without the same sort of edge.
Thomas Chamberlain.
Consultant Forensic Pathologist.
Jack Hodgson.
You're the new gaffer?
I saw the press release.
You're coming in to, what was it, "restore confidence in the centre".
I didn't know we'd lost anyone's confidence.
I didn't write it.
Course not.
Hodgson...?
Hmm.
What are you?
Forensic science.
Been at the Lyell Centre 15 months and accounted for 27% of its profits.
If you say so.
Hello.
Clarissa Mullery, this is Thomas Chamberlain.
Hello, Clarissa.
Hmm.
What are you?
Are you kidding me?
Do you know how offensive that is?
No, not particularly, no.
You're that insensitive?
I don't consider myself insensitive.
"What are you?"!
Do you think I'm some sort of monster?
I'm beginning to.
Clarissa works with me.
Forensic Examiner.
That's what she is.
That is what I do.
That is not who I am.
Two separate things.
I am what I do.
That must make it easier to keep track of...
Clarissa Mullery.
You are "insightful, analytical, and your perspicacity is
"fundamental to the success of the Forensic Science team."
Who told you that?
End-of-year assessment.
You said that?
I didn't mean it.
I'm confident the torso disfigurement was a result of the lifting claw.
The disfigurement of her face and hands are a consequence of hydrochloric acid.
To prevent identification?
I can't tell you the motive, but it could suggest that it was a murder with forethought.
I think that a plastic bag was put over the victim's head - the marks are where it was tied.
And I observed small pinpoints, haemorrhages within the sclera of the eyes, which may be suggestive of asphyxia.
However, I don't think that she was dead when the acid was poured on her face.
The raised red lines around the acid burns... as well as evidence of acid burns in her mouth, throat, oesophagus and airways, suggest that she was still alive when the acid was thrown in her face,
and she was gasping for breath.
How could they do this?
Practically or morally?
Practically
- I think that she was drugged and then murdered.
The fluid in her stomach had a high diazepine concentration.
I think that the drug was dissolved in fluid and then ingested.
So she was knocked out, strangled, disfigured.
I haven't had the bloods back but I'm expecting them today.
Morally?
Well, there is no answer, is there?
I will do everything that I can to help you get the person or people who did this, and bring them to justice.
She was drugged?
Yes.
Was she raped?
No.
No?
Then why?
Why?
Why would they?
You know the world's a desperate, tragic place when the fact she wasn't raped is scarier than if she was.
Oh, Dr Alexander?
Yes.
Sorry to disturb you.
Thomas Chamberlain?
That's right.
I'm replacing Professor Dalton.
No, you're not.
You're taking over from him.
Well, actually, I'm, er, I'm taking over from you.
I didn't want the job, but if you want to say that you're taking over, if it makes you feel better, then fine.
Knock yourself out.
I saw the press release.
We're not getting off to a good start.
No?
The whole team seems to have some sort of a passive-aggressive thing going on.
It must be very difficult to work together.
We don't seem to struggle.
It's just me.
It was that word "replace".
I need to shower and get changed.
It wasn't the right word.
Perhaps we could talk about it later?
Unless you're intending to stay here and perv.
That was not an invitation.
Yes.
Yes, I got that.
I'm sensitive.
Isaac.
Hi.
Hey!
Come on in.
COMMENTARY:
It's a great strike, and that's a fantastic goal.
Isaac?
You need to speak to the people who make this, Mousa.
I'm much faster than this!
I'm as fast as Bale or Walcott.
Right?
Go on, go on.
I mean, seriously, you've got to get them to fix that.
They're disrespecting me, man!
ISAAC!
I was about to score.
Oh, Jack?
Hmm?
Can you have a look at the lot number and serial number on these?
We can check them against the EU Register and find out who they belonged to.
See you.
Yo.
You know Ron McNally from the club?
Yeah.
You helped us with that Twitter stuff right?
I tried.
Yeah!
I had like maybe 15,000 death threats.
Yeah.
That was funny.
Yeah.
Own goal, wasn't it?
I don't know where my brain was on that one.
Must have been the steroids I was taking.
Just messing with you, Mo!
I don't take that shit.
Makes your bollocks shrink and turns you into a monster.
Where's Monica?
Interviewing nannies.
Yeah, the last one quit.
She's, er, she's picking an ugly one for me.
What?
What is it, Mo?
You have a DVD player?
Serial Number:
FR34728.
Lot Number: 10-15-90.
And the lot number is 10-15-90.
We're looking for the name of the patient who received the implants.
The Lyell Centre.
London.
Erm, oui.
Un moment.
Nikki!
Dr Chamberlain?
European Register of Prostheses.
They want to speak to a doctor.
(They're French.)
Oui.
Hallo?
Thomas Chamberlain, Docteur de pathologie.
Vous avez le nom.
A oui, un moment.
Eva Liron.
How much does she want?
She wants 120,000.
Is she crazy?
Do you know her?
You saw the tape?
Of course.
She was an au pair.
120,000?
Don't be so stupid.
The note says she has footage where you beat the woman up.
Oh, yeah?
Then show me!
I've never beat up a woman.
Never.
I think you should pay.
You don't believe me?
They can do things to videos.
And next week, hmm?
How much will it be next week?
150?
200?
We're trying to get you a new club.
We've lost almost every sponsor.
Then what?
Miss a penalty?
Get sent off?
For a sex tape?
Never.
Beating up women doesn't raise your value in the market.
There's no tape of me beating up a woman.
Do you want to take a chance?
There's no tape of me beating up a woman because I never did.
Tu comprend ca?
Never.
You know I don't care about these things, Isaac.
I really don't.
Hey, Mo, why aren't you asking if the club is doing this to get rid of me?
That's what you should be asking.
Oh, that's ridiculous!
The club wants to get rid of me and suddenly... ..this shows up.
Nobody wants to see your value drop, Isaac.
This is because of the Twitter.
This is the payback.
I'm not going to listen to this.
Ron, wait!
Maybe they knock women around in Riyadh.
I don't care if...
Maybe that's how they get off.
What you do is your business.
Just get out of my house.
All of you.
Get out!
Are you OK?
Yeah.
I'm fine.
Everything's fine.
MUTED:
That sofa's to go.
A couple of smaller sofas here...
Rachel Freedman doesn't have a sister.
Who was the woman that came to see her?
She called herself Ruth.
That's all we've got.
Why would she come here?
To get information.
Well, how would she find out where Rachel's and Nathan's bodies were being kept?
Adam Freedman?
She asked him?
She followed him.
We're working from the theory that Eva Liron's body was transported to the amenity site by a rubbish truck.
Or a skip.
I think it was a skip.
Yeah, could be either.
Both use Smithy Environmental.
It was a skip.
The rubbish trucks in this area won't collect garden waste.
The public parks use skips.
The amount of organic material around the body...
Organic material?
ALL:
Grass.
Right.
..makes me think that it must have come from a large open space, not a private garden.
Eva's body was in a skip covered by grass, which prevented its discovery.
And possibly masked any odour that could have alerted someone to its presence.
So you think the deceased died in a public park?
No.
Clarissa?
This is the approximate catchment area for Smithy Environmental.
There are more than 40 open spaces that we estimate could account for the volume of grass we saw at Smithy Environmental.
We had to find a way to narrow the location.
How did we do that, Clarissa?
We looked at the grass.
Were we surprised?
We were surprised.
We found that the grass we sampled was a blend of?
Bizet perennial ryegrass,
Verdi perennial ryegrass and Limousine smooth-stalked meadow grass.
And this combination of grasses is used for?
Professional sports pitches.
Ah, not parks?
No.
And we found another substance on the blades of grass.
A white substance.
Calcium carbonate, which is...
The white chalk they use to line a pitch.
We checked the list of skips that had been delivered on the morning the body was found, and discovered that a skip came from?
Duchess Meadows.
And what is in Duchess Meadows?
You're just showing off.
It's where City have their training ground.
You're a City fan?
Since I was a boy!
LOUD GUNSHOTS
Hey, Lucy.
Isaac!
Sami, you all right?
Hi.
I need to speak to Mo.
Hi.
Come in.
Pay her.
Hi, it's Nikki.
Bloods on the child, Nathan Freedman.
Could you run them again please?
We can get a fresh sample to you.
I'd prefer that.
Eliminate any possibility of contamination.
Isaac would like to pay what they want to make this go away.
They gave you details of how to make the transaction?
Your son was difficult to control.
He didn't react well to strangers.
He hit out at them?
Yeah, and might try to bite them if he was very, very scared.
And to you?
He was never very, very scared?
Did you use any kinds of drugs to try and calm him down?
No.
No benzodiazepines?
Painkillers?
No!
Well, just to take the edge off him?
Are you mad?
Would you give your child drugs to calm them down or shut them up because you couldn't cope?
I don't have children.
Which explains the stupidity of your question.
HE PANTS
Detective Inspector.
Mr McNally.
Nice to meet you.
I asked Bazza Numan, one of our groundsmen, to join us.
This way.
25 years with the police, I was.
Can't say I enjoyed every one of them, but...
I am proud of them.
How often do you cut the grass?
Every day.
Training ground and stadium.
Sometimes two or three days if it's been raining.
Doesn't grow so fast in the winter.
And you put it in the skip there?
Yep.
That's the way they want it done.
Is the gate normally locked?
If the skip pick-up is very early in the morning, they'll...
They'll leave it open.
CCTV?
Not here.
Training ground, player areas - of course.
But...here?
"Muriatic."
It's just another name for hydrochloric acid, isn't it?
I don't know, sir.
What do you use it for?
Clean the cement.
Gets rid of grime.
You have to wear gloves.
May I speak with Dr Alexander, please?
Hi.
Sorry to trouble you.
Do you know this woman?
No, sorry.
Could this have disfigured Eva Liron?
The same chemical.
Undiluted, it would be capable of inflicting the injuries we've seen.
Hi.
Sorry to trouble you, Mr Dreyfus.
Em, would you mind signing this?
For my daughter.
Yeah, sure.
Thanks.
Really appreciate it, mate.
You're welcome.
Erm...
Do you know this woman?
Why?
What happened?
She was murdered.
No.
I'm sorry.
I-I don't know her.
Bye.
The clippings are so fine, the body sinks, gets covered by fertilisers, nitrates - you know the sort of stuff, snail killer...
And it's in a confined space.
The chemicals in the grass will change the rate of decomposition of the body.
Grass will insulate, but it'll also produce its own heat.
Which could speed things up and cause burns and charring.
But if there's not enough air then it will slow the process.
We're really pinning this down(!
)
Hi.
Erm, sorry to trouble you, Carlos.
Do you know this woman?
Si.
She used to work for Isaac.
Eva Liron's dead.
Dead?
How did she...?
She was murdered.
Oh, my God.
I...
I have to call Isaac.
Where is your husband?
He should be home soon.
VOICEMAIL: 'This is Isaac.
Leave a message.'
Oh, my God.
Is that...
Is that Isaac Dreyfus?
THEY WHISPER EXCITEDLY
CAMERA CLICKS
I have to see Mousa.
Hey, Isaac.
He's not here.
Where is he?
I don't know...
Sami?
At a meeting?
Have you tried to call him?
He's not answering his phone!
I'll...
let him know, yeah?
MONICA:
She was highly recommended.
Her references were very good.
I...
I liked her very much.
And then she just disappeared.
It was strange.
She seemed happy.
I tried to contact her, but she never answered her phone.
She just disappeared.
Why didn't you call the police?
To say what? "Our nanny quit"?
I couldn't even get the police to come when I thought someone broke into our house.
You OK?
GIGGLING:
Yes!
Sorry, I had to collect Zara.
Mama!
Police?
Detective Inspector John Leighton.
City fan?
Nope.
Dommage.
I prefer rugby.
Are you OK to answer a few questions?
Sweetie, why don't you go upstairs and play, OK?
When did you last see Eva Liron?
Um...ten days ago?
Yeah, just...
Just before the match in Newcastle.
And you have a clear memory of it?
Yeah, of course.
I mean, Monica panicked when Eva didn't show up for work.
My wife had never been to Newcastle before and she was going to go with me.
But she couldn't come.
No idea who would have wanted to do her harm?
No.
OK.
Thank you.
Oh, er...
Forensics believe that her body was dumped at the training ground.
That's why we were there today and why we were asking people if they'd seen Eva or knew who she was.
Why did you pretend not to know her?
Well, because it made me look guilty and, um...
I'm not guilty.
Yeah, of course.
Do we need a solicitor?
No.
No.
Should I call my father?
Don't worry.
We'll be good.
Are you coming to bed?
I slept with her.
I slept with Eva.
I slept with her and she made a tape.
She was trying to get money from me.
I'm sorry.
How could you do this to us?
How could you be so weak?
!
In my bed?
No.
A hotel.
An away match.
She followed you to a match?
!
Did you...?
No!
Of course not!
I-I didn't know she was dead until today.
I was going to pay her...
Monica!
You have to believe me!
SHE SOBS
Oh, baby...
Do you love me?
Oui.
I'm sorry.
Oh.
Nice.
Every girl should have one.
Every girl secretly wants to be a WAG.
Yeah.
Why wouldn't you?
Let your whole existence be defined by a bloke.
Excuse me, please.
Ah.
Come in.
Well, what do you think?
I think it's, er...amazing and marks you out as a man of incredible taste and vision.
Do you think she meant that?
Absolutely.
Right.
Do you think Isaac Dreyfus has anything to do with it?
I need evidence.
I need motive.
How many nannies do you know with a...?
Breast augmentation.
That just trips off the tongue.
How many?
What's your point?
There isn't always one.
You think Eva Liron targeted him?
OK.
She pursues him.
Probably just for fun at first.
She gets him to sleep with her.
She decides, "That was easy."
"I'd like the rest of that lifestyle as well."
He says, "No".
She threatens to blow up his life.
He kills her.
A bleak world-view.
He's 26, right?
For each one of those years, he's been told he's marvellous, special.
He doesn't know what's right or wrong.
He just does.
Although the cliche is attractive...
It's a cliche because we all know it happens.
Now, his window of opportunity is limited because he travels so much.
So I need you to be very precise about Eva Liron's time of death.
Trying to estimate her time of death won't be easy.
She will have died at least a week ago.
There are no fly eggs on the body and there is evidence of putrefaction, marbling along blood vessels...
Can we get within a day?
I need...
I need to be able to limit any alibi...
A day is fairly exact...
Oh, we should be able to do that.
We presume that she was murdered at the training ground, but we don't know.
The environment in the skip is moist, but we don't know how long it was in the skip.
The acid will have caused a rise in temperature...
We can play with the information we've got and give the Detective Inspector what he needs, can't we?
You have the skills and resources, don't you, Dr Alexander?
I'll be at my desk.
Magistrate's given us a warrant to search his house.
Thanks for your time.
Thank you.
Jack?
Did I say something...?
She doesn't "play with information" and she doesn't lie.
Asking if she "had the skills"?
You're lucky you can still pee standing up.
Great leadership, by the way.
Restored my confidence.
What's going on?
Morning, Mrs Dreyfus.
I have a warrant to search your house.
Sergio, you take upstairs.
Peter, in there.
James, Eddie - kitchen.
Oh, come on!
Why are you doing this?
Why?
Monica.
Zara, come on.
Let's watch TV, OK?
Mousa!
?
Where are you?
The police are here searching my house.
Call me back.
You're just trying to make yourself famous.
Huh?
Is that what it is?
Yeah, it was always my dream.
Oh...
C'est pour moi, tout ca?
Mm-hm...
Hey!
Stop it!
Detective Leighton!
Stop that.
Can you...?
Yeah.
Thanks.
Detective Leighton, you need to see this.
I didn't kill her.
Are you listening?
I didn't kill her.
Monica, call your father!
REPORTER:
Isaac!
Isaac!
REPORTERS YELL
You know each other?
Yep.
Yeah.
I needed to see both of you.
His father says they didn't use drugs.
Some families don't.
He admitted that Nathan could be violent and strike out at strangers.
Well, I don't think that the presence of benzodiazepine in Nathan's bloods has anything to do with his autism.
The cocktail of anti-psychotic drugs and painkillers used to kill Nathan Freedman is the same as those found in the bloods of Eva Liron.
It may not mean anything, but it is highly unusual.
I can't explain it, but...
I think you may be looking for the same killer.
Well, we've already got a suspect.
Mousa Rashid's dead.
I'm not all the things you think I am.
I didn't kill the girl.
I'm not the one who'll judge you.
Please!
I don't know what to do.
I'm so scared.
I need more physical evidence.
I need you two to step up.
How have we not stepped up?
Leighton called.
Says Jack assaulted him.
What?
She allows herself to be photographed but leaves no DNA and no prints.
Someone went through my files and photocopied a highly confidential document.
And you think that was me?
GUNSHOTS
Who are you?
Carlo de Medici,
Cosimo's son.
You'll never know how absolution soothes my soul.
There is no absolution.
Not from me.
Your only mission was to get the son of the Sultan to Rome.
Once that was accomplished, the outcome was all but assured.
If Bayezid is killed, the result is war.
If he is imprisoned, war again.
If he is dishonored and dismissed, retaliation will be required.
Carlo?
You took long enough.
King Alfonso pledges to act as the Sword of Rome, rejecting your offer of alliance.
Girolamo Riario, you were dead.
Now you're born again.
Who are you?
What did you just say?
I have said enough!
Aagh!
No!
I will make this right.

He needs a physic.
Staunch his wounds as best you can.
We need to ensure no one else is harmed!
Carlo de Medici.
He's in there as well?
No, no.
He's the one who did this.
He killed Andrea.
No.
Are you sure?
I have to go after him.
Maestro, you're bleeding!

No!
We'll mount a search for Carlo as soon as this fire is out.
Let me go!
Maestro!
Sorry, artista, my duty is to Florence.
Move!
Yaargh!
Maestro?
Am I in trouble again?
Close the door, Leonardo.
This space... will be your workshop, Leo.
My workshop?
The time has come for you to go out on your own.
To become a maestro.
Let your work speak for what you believe and love.
Soar, my boy, and be bold and fearless.
And the world will never forget you.
I don't know what to say.
Shake my hand and accept this.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Maestro.
No, no.
It's Andrea now.
Leo?
You should go and tell your father about this.
There's no need.
He just told me.
Andrea.
Andrea.
We've controlled the fire, signora.
All of Florence will mourn him.
Yes, they will.
And you sheltered his murderer.
What?
Carlo did this.
The man you've shared your bed with.
He tried to kill Leonardo as well.
There must be some mistake.
Several reports confirm Carlo fleeing on horseback.
Da Vinci is in pursuit.
But Da Vinci...
We must clear the streets.
Of course.
Come, Vanessa.
I'm not going anywhere.
It isn't safe here.
Safer than the palace, where I lived with a killer!
Don't make this more difficult than it needs to be.
I'm never going back.
Captain, escort Vanessa to the palace.
Do it.
You can't force her back there.
The child she carries is a Medici.
I make the decisions for this family.
And all of Florence.
Florence is a republic.
It is her right, as a citizen, to choose how and where she wants to live.
If she believes she's better off away from the palace, you have no right...
Leave him alone.
Who are you, that dares speak so disrespectfully to me?
A citizen who knows the law.
I find that very hard to believe.
My name is Nico Machiavelli, son to the honorable legal scholar, Bernardo.
It's a pleasure, signora.
Oh, my God.
Vanessa.
Oh, my God!
Come on, my lady.
Push.
I can see the head.
That's it, my lady.
That's it, it's coming.
Let's wrap him up.
There.
It's a little boy, my lady.
A male heir at last.
Lorenzo will be pleased.
Be still, Da Vinci.
You need to rest.
Are you really here?
Of course.
I reached the Vault of Heaven.
But the Book of Leaves was gone.
You lied to me.
It was your mother who lied.

The Sons of Mithras believed her an ally.
She would not be the first of our kind to falter.
Cosimo's son, Carlo.
He's a member of the Labyrinth.
He killed my mentor.
I warned you.
They will stop at nothing.
He heard my mother's message.
And now he is on his way to find the Book.
To us, the Book represents knowledge.
In the hands of the Enemies of Man, it will be a weapon more powerful than any army.
Oh, I will fix this.
Why, to stop the Labyrinth?
Or to avenge your mentor's death?
I owe Verrocchio... ..everything I am.
So unless you are willing to help me find the man who killed him,
I suggest you get out of my way.
This death, it has already changed you.
Your quest has changed me!
Do you even know where you're going?
My mother's code...
It said "Book", "Home", "Child".
I thought she was talking about Vinci, but... ..Carlo spoke of another meaning.
Perhaps she was not sending you to your childhood home.
She was sending you to hers.
The Book is in Constantinople.
It is...if we are to believe your mother.
The journey before you will be monumental.
At every turn, you risk losing your way.
Then come with me.
There is... a port city in the Kingdom of Naples.
A place called Otranto.
In every possible outcome, that is where you will find what you seek.
We have seen the lives that you've taken in the name of a false god.
We know the man that you've become.
What do you know about the man I've become?
We have many eyes.
You've gone to great lengths to find the Book of Leaves.
It was all in vain.
The Book will never be found.
And if your faction and the Sons of Mithras and God and the devil himself want to kill each other to use it, the world will be a better place without every single one of you.
The Sons of Mithras may be tempted by the idea of the Book's existence.
But this is where they fail to see.
Man is imperfect.
Imagine the horrors they would bring unto themselves if they ever found the Book of Leaves.
What do you want from me?
We want nothing from you, brother.
We want something for you.
From the Carpathian Sea, a body of water so dense with the earth's salt, it remains untainted by life.
Girolamo.
Your vision is clouded, but in time, we will make you see.
Aargh!
Leo?
Leo?
Hey.
Hey.
Good work.
No, it was Al-Rahim.
Here.
I'm sorry, Leo.
Andrea was...
I know.
I'd tell you to heal first but I know you've got a plan.
Carlo's headed to Otranto.
From there...
Constantinople.
It's where my mother hid the Book.
I'm sorry, Zo.
I can't ask you to come with me.
Not this time.
Good.
The answer's no, anyway.
But... if I happen to be heading to Otranto to slay the bastard fuck who killed my friend's mentor, you wouldn't mind if I tagged along, would you?
Not at all.
He deserves every inch of this.
He'll receive worse.
Ah, Lorenzo.
Do join us.
It's time to conclude our business.
Once you provide the locations of the Medici gold reserves,
I will guarantee the safety of your family.
I come bearing news from Florence.
Duke Federico of Urbino is... dead.
Impossible.
He holds the city in his grasp.
He did, until a citizen uprising overthrew him.
Led by Leonardo Da Vinci.
Mm-hm.
So in light of this,
I believe our business is concluded.
You think I'll just let you leave?
You can throw me back in chains if you wish.
But the time for negotiations between us is over.
I am no longer interested in putting you back in chains, but in the ground!
Don't do this, husband.
What Italian states will trade with us if you kill one of their own?
Something tells me, they won't all miss him quite as much as you.
Bring the banker his sword.
Ever the child.
The only way out of Naples is through its king.
Kings are crowned.
You were anointed with your father's blood.
My father was a monster who deserved his end.
And you are every bit his son.
Hold!
You know nothing of leadership!
Make it quick, but know my men will cut you down as soon as you've finished.
Magnificence, perhaps you should reconsider.
I've been considering this for months.
Your Majesty?
My apologies, I have an urgent message.
What is it?
A naval fleet is heading towards the Neapolitan city of Otranto.
My liege, it is the Ottoman Empire.
Kill me... and you'll all die at the hands of the heathens.
Put up your sword, Medici.
Today the Lord shows us that the only way to fight one's true enemies is to embrace one's fellow Christians.
Do you know how far the Ottomans will have to travel before they reach Florence?
You would abandon us?
Florence is ex-communicated.
You abandoned us long ago.
Then perhaps it is time for the Lord to accept Florence back into his fold.
What the fuck's going on here?
Hey, hey, hey!
What the fuck's going on here?
Harbor's closed.
Unless you're keen to face 20 ships of bloodthirsty Turks.
Are there no other ports open down the coast?
No.
Shit.
This way.
You realize we're the only ones trying to get into this fucking city?
Look.
Carlo!
Urgh!
Aargh!
Argh!
What?
Zo!
No, no, no, no!
Where did Carlo go?
You're too late, Da Vinci, he's gone.
The last port has closed.
You had your chance but failed.
Who the hell are we facing here?
My Lord, there they are.
The thorn in the side of Christendom.
Good reason, if any, to unite.
Manned with 2, 000 janissaries, trained for battle since they could walk.
The Ottomans just brought the next Holy War to my doorstep.
What resources do you have?
Four cannons, not one able to reach their ships.
And 800 soldiers.
I'll send lucrative offers of assistance to the Knights of St.John and the Order of the Dragon.
It's possible we can hold the city till reinforcements arrive.
For a day, a week.
If they breach these walls, they'll behead me like they did the King of Varna.
You must send for your Swiss mercenaries in Rome.
Leave the Church of St. Peter defenseless?
Absolutely not.
Your hand guided them here.
When the son of the Sultan came to Rome weeks ago, he brought with him an offer of peace.
A hollow offer.
You killed his men and disgraced him.
I don't recall you objecting.
If the Turks are victorious here, it gives them a strong hold to take all of Italy.
And they will.
Unless you enlist a war engineer to help.
Where's my fucking ship?
Ssh!
Give me one reason not to kill you where you stand.
You have 20 reasons not to.
Da Vinci?
The Book of Leaves?
Not yet.
I must get to Constantinople.
But cannot, with an invasion fleet in your path.
It's your obsessions that drive this.
What does that matter?
Da Vinci has many interests.
But you have no reason to believe his intentions are less than honorable.
Let's save the reunion.
What's your offer, Da Vinci?
Will you build weapons to defend Otranto from a siege?
No.
But I will help you mount an offensive.
What is that sound?
An Ottoman custom.
It means they want to talk.
No.
Lucrezia.
You would protect her?
Yeah, and you.
Let's hear what she has to say.
Does she still serve at your behest?
Is this your scheme?
Of course not.
I've no idea why she's here.
Who is this woman?
A traitor.
Used for the Holy father's machinations.
With whom you willingly shared your bed.
Lucrezia Donati?
How is it possible your mistress is an emissary of the Ottoman Empire?
Leaders of the Italian peninsula.
Bayezid II, the son of the Sultan, Mehmed the Conqueror, offers you the safety of the Italian people upon your meeting his three conditions.
That heathen dares come to us with conditions?
The first: you must cede control of the city of Otranto to the great Ottoman Empire, without resistance.
The second: all heads of state throughout Italy shall renounce Christianity, accept the call of Allah and convert to Islam.
Lucrezia, what are you doing?
The third:
your Church's Holy Father, the man who has taken the title of Pope, must journey to Constantinople, crawl across the Topkapi Palace, and kiss the feet of the Sultan.
Guards, tear out this whore's blasphemous heart.
No, wait!
Wait, wait.
Why are you doing this?
Because of him.
The man you know as Pope Sixtus is not the true Pope but an imposter.
She's an infidel.
A murderer who's made a mockery of the Roman Church and every one of you.
The true Pope, the man chosen by God, rots in a cell in the Vatican.
His twin brother.
My father.
And this monster took my... ..took my sister's life before my eyes.
He is no Pope, nor even a priest.
Lies.
All lies.
You know.
You saw my father imprisoned in the tower of Castel Sant'Angelo.
Tell them.
You know this to be true?
Tell them.
I knew the prisoner was her father.
But not the true Pope.
He never revealed his face to me.
I am the Pope, the one and only.
Anointed by God!
Do you not understand yet?
Why this is all happening, why Bayezid came to you.
Why it is I that stand before you now?
It is my father who has guided you all to this place.
No.
You'll not dispose of her so quickly.
I'll know the truth first.
Let's keep her locked under guard for now.
I demand you kill her.
Take her to a cell.
Otranto is under my authority.
And what of him?
He shall remain unharmed as well.
Any attempt otherwise, and I shall show you God's wrath.
You haven't considered Bayezid's offer.
I think I'll let my army give him my answer.
For several nights, 20 of Bayezid's ships have stood at the ready.
At dawn, you will feel the full power of the Ottoman Empire.
When it brings us all to our knees.
I suggest you consider their offer.
Have mercy upon me, O, God.
Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity.
And cleanse me from my sin.
Amen.
You believe I should run?
I am the King of Naples!
Only if you survive.
Sacrifice Otranto and you may ultimately be hailed as your kingdom's savior.
Hundreds of citizens will die!
A necessary price.
Ready the horses for Rome.
Your Holiness!
Release me.
Surely you don't expect me to number among your dead?
Perhaps you scurry away because that Donati woman's accusations are true.
You seek truth?
Perhaps your citizens should learn the real story of your father's demise.
Yes.
I thought not.
There are other battles to fight, young king.
The palace has sustained significant damage under Duke Federico.
Such is the price of liberty.
I'm sure you'll see to the restoration of the palace in due time, signore.
There is one more thing, signora.
Yes?
A substantial sum was withdrawn from the bank before the Duke's troops ever even arrived.
Orchestrated by someone with Medici signatory powers.
500,000 florins.
More than we keep in our Bruges and London vaults combined.
Now that Carlo has gone, someone will have to assume the blame.
Leave me.
Bastard.
Bastard!
She's trying to take him from me.
All this document does is officially establish Giuliano is his father, thereby giving him the right to the Medici surname.
Do you know how many bastard children...
I've made my decision, Nico.
I am not signing it.
As bad as this place may be, he'd have a wealth of advantages.
He is a Medici.
His father was slaughtered for that name.
As soon as I've regained my strength,
I'm taking him as far from here as I can.
What?
It'd be better to start over some place.
You're leaving?
You said it yourself.
I'm a citizen of Florence.
A free one.
You're making a mistake.
The only mistake would be staying any longer than we have to.
Argh!
We are the horns of the increate.
We're the shadows at the center of the Labyrinth.
But we are men, not gods.
We live in flesh and blood and bone.
How many of us occupy this chamber?
Stop asking me the same question.
Girolamo.
How many of us occupy this chamber?
Four.
There are four of you, as I've told you again and again.
Aargh!
Girolamo, Icarus flew so close to the sun that he crashed to the earth.
But the fault lay not with him.
It was his father, Daedalus, the clever inventor, who built his son wings so that he could fly.
We have been tasked to destroy the Book.
For if it is ever found, well, then we will all pay for the sins of Daedalus.
What do you want from me?
For you to see what we see.
How many of us occupy this chamber?
Aargh!
You should have never come here.
Even this far from Florence, you're still trying to control me.
I'm trying to save your life, boy.
There is a way through them.
You do not honor Verrocchio by following him to the grave.
I may not have known him well, but I believe he'd tell you the same.
If I do not reach Constantinople,
whatever happens here... it won't matter.
Our fates will be sealed.
We're animals in the end, nothing more, nothing less.
Lorenzo and I are leaving for Florence.
You could join us.
There is no cowardice in standing down.
Not with gifts like yours.
Ohh!
Gather your things, Da Vinci.
Time to return home.
No, no!
This battle can be won.
I have seen you perform marvels, Da Vinci, but this is beyond even you.
We are outnumbered by thousands.
Yes, just as the Greeks were by the Persians in the Battle of Salamis.
Look.
Say we can disable the Ottoman ships as each enters the harbor.
We create a barrier no other ship could pass, rendering their numbers irrelevant.
It'd force the remaining ships to retreat.
In theory, yes, but...
Such a thing is not possible not with the meager resources they have here.
What if we use this - a turret gun.
Enabled with your four cannons, a pivoting base which would allow it to fire on different ships and a spy glass to ensure accuracy.
My cannons can only travel half the distance you need.
Yes.
Shush.
That's why this is only half the solution.
The other half...
specialized projectiles.
We'll hollow out the center, which will reduce the weight and increase the distance they can travel.
Bore a hole?
Yes.
Bore a hole.
Much in the same way that you bore a room.
It was first attempted by Sigismondo Malatesta when he was fighting the Turks for Venice.
We then fill the hollow center with gunpowder, attach a fuse.
We will then have bombshells capable of crippling the Ottoman fleet in the harbor.
You expect me to risk...
my entire kingdom on this?
Your kingdom is beyond risk already.
What do you need from me?
Giulio?
The boy is fine.
Perfect, in fact.
Ssh.
When I first came to this palace,
I considered myself much more than Lorenzo's youthful bride.
I was an educated woman.
But I still had so much to learn.
But from the day you came here... ..you carried something deep with you.
More than just the boy.
I know it was a difficult decision.
But the things we do... we do them for Florence.
It was better when I believed you dead.
I'm so sorry for everything I've done to you, Lorenzo.
You expect my forgiveness?
No.
I came here knowing this day would... most likely be my last.
Was it ever true, Lucrezia... what happened between us, what you said you felt?
You owe me the truth.
Just this once.
No.
I didn't love you.
I'm sorry.
Lorenzo!
Lorenzo, you cannot do this!
We may all soon be dead.
I will not leave the satisfaction of killing this traitor to the Turks.
She may have unmasked the very man who sought to take our city.
She brought the conspirators to within a hair's breadth of murdering my entire family!
She sent me to save you at the Duomo that day.
We will not be safe until we rid ourselves of every duplicitous fucking one of them!
Cosimo intended those swords of ours to defend the people of Florence.
I am.
When you are faced with Andrea's killer... will you yield, let anyone stand in your way?
No.
Then, why, Da Vinci, why...
You still wear her ring.
You're in love with someone... utterly incapable of it.
Perhaps the same could be said of me.
Perhaps... you deserve one another.
Eventually even you won't be able to stop him.
Would you have preferred I not?
I told myself, once, once I had exposed Sixtus, relief would come.
And has it?
I didn't do this for me.
I just need you to know that.
I do.
I know.
Avenging a father... is a cause...
I now understand.
This wasn't about my father.
This was about my sister.
I wanted her life... her death to mean something.
It will.
It will.
You gave me your most... cherished possession.
I've just realized,
I never gave you anything in return.
No, wait.
You will be tried as a traitor.
Yeah.
I am now responsible, for every life in Otranto.
And that includes yours.
I don't deserve this.
Yes, you do.
Come with me.
Bayezid will take no prisoners.
I can't.
I can't.
But I give you my vow,
I will see you again in this waking life.
We are the horns of the increate.
We are the shadows at the center of the Labyrinth but we are men, not gods.
We live in flesh and blood and bone.
How many of us occupy this chamber?
We are the horns...
End this.
Do with me...what you will.
Girolamo.
How many of us occupy this chamber?
Four of you.
Girolamo.
Tell me what you see.
Four.
There are four of you.
How many of us occupy this chamber?
How many of us occupy this chamber?
How many of us occupy this chamber?
How many of us occupy this chamber?
One.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
We are one.
We are one, Girolamo.
You can't just leave.
You sound like the rest of them.
Clarice will eventually respect the fact you are Giulio's mother.
You're wrong, Nico.
She's not capable of respect.
Signorina?
I apologize for the intrusion.
Something wrong, Captain?
Signora Orsini.
Last night, she sent the girls to Villa del Trebbio.
She gave a footman strict instructions to deliver this to me.
Clarice has gone.
Where?
She asks that no one attempts to find her.
I brought this to you as soon as I could.
Your son is the only Medici left in Florence.
No, he's not, I never...
Yes, you did.
You did sign it, didn't you?
Forgery is no minor offense.
Of course I did.
My son is a Medici, after all.
With Lorenzo and Clarice both absent, your son is the sole representative of their bloodline.
Which makes you... as his mother... the Regent Head of the House of Medici.
And the most powerful person in all of Florence.
What does the other side of the world look like?
Different.
Did you ever consider staying, leaving all this behind?
And miss all the fun?
The fleet is preparing.
Judging by wind speed, they should be within range in two minutes.
Right, turn it to the left.
Stop, stop, stop.
That's it, stop.
Load the cannons.
Load the cannons!
Three... two... one...
Now!
The deaths that happen, have to happen.
Enjoy the view.
It may be the last thing we e6er see.
No, it cannot be.
What's wrong?
What?
Leonardo, the woman on the deck standing next to the Ottoman prince.
That is your mother.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
Who are you?
Carlo de Medici,
Cosimo's son.
You'll never know how absolution soothes my soul.
There is no absolution.
Not from me.
Your only mission was to get the son of the Sultan to Rome.
Once that was accomplished, the outcome was all but assured.
If Bayezid is killed, the result is war.
If he is imprisoned, war again.
If he is dishonored and dismissed, retaliation will be required.
Carlo?
You took long enough.
King Alfonso pledges to act as the Sword of Rome, rejecting your offer of alliance.
Girolamo Riario, you were dead.
Now you're born again.
Who are you?
What did you just say?
I have said enough!
Aagh!
No!
I will make this right.

What the hell's happened?
He needs a physic.
Staunch his wounds as best you can.
We need to ensure no one else is harmed!
Carlo de Medici.
He's in there as well?
No, no.
He's the one who did this.
He killed Andrea.
No.
Are you sure?
I have to go after him.
Maestro, you're bleeding!
Leo.
No!
We'll mount a search for Carlo as soon as this fire is out.
Let me go!
Maestro!
Sorry, artista, my duty is to Florence.

Move!
Yaargh!

(Groans, horse whinnies)
(Grunts)
(Groans in frustration)
Maestro?
Am I in trouble again?
(VERROCCHIO) Close the door, Leonardo.
(Grunts)
This space... will be your workshop, Leo.
My workshop?
The time has come for you to go out on your own.
To become a maestro.
Let your work speak for what you believe and love.
Soar, my boy, and be bold and fearless.
And the world will never forget you.
I don't know what to say.
Shake my hand and accept this.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Maestro.
No, no.
It's Andrea now.
(Sobs)
Leo?
You should go and tell your father about this.
There's no need.
He just told me.
Andrea.
Andrea.
We've controlled the fire, signora.
All of Florence will mourn him.
Yes, they will.
And you sheltered his murderer.
What?
Carlo did this.
The man you've shared your bed with.
He tried to kill Leonardo as well.
There must be some mistake.
Several reports confirm Carlo fleeing on horseback.
Da Vinci is in pursuit.
But Da Vinci...
We must clear the streets.
Of course.
Come, Vanessa.
I'm not going anywhere.
It isn't safe here.
Safer than the palace, where I lived with a killer!
Don't make this more difficult than it needs to be.
I'm never going back.
Captain, escort Vanessa to the palace.
Do it.
(NICO) You can't force her back there.
The child she carries is a Medici.
I make the decisions for this family.
And all of Florence.
Florence is a republic.
It is her right, as a citizen, to choose how and where she wants to live.
If she believes she's better off away from the palace, you have no right...
Leave him alone.
Who are you, that dares speak so disrespectfully to me?
A citizen who knows the law.
I find that very hard to believe.
My name is Nico Machiavelli, son to the honorable legal scholar, Bernardo.
It's a pleasure, signora.
Oh, my God.
Vanessa.
Oh, my God!
(Yells in pain)
Come on, my lady.
Push.

I can see the head.
That's it, my lady.
That's it, it's coming.

(Baby cries)
(MIDWIFE) Let's wrap him up.
There.
It's a little boy, my lady.
A male heir at last.
Lorenzo will be pleased.
Be still, Da Vinci.
You need to rest.
Are you really here?
Of course.
I reached the Vault of Heaven.
But the Book of Leaves was gone.
You lied to me.
It was your mother who lied.
To us.
The Sons of Mithras believed her an ally.
She would not be the first of our kind to falter.
Cosimo's son, Carlo.
He's a member of the Labyrinth.
He killed my mentor.
I warned you.
They will stop at nothing.
He heard my mother's message.
And now he is on his way to find the Book.
To us, the Book represents knowledge.
In the hands of the Enemies of Man, it will be a weapon more powerful than any army.
Oh, I will fix this.
Why, to stop the Labyrinth?
Or to avenge your mentor's death?
I owe Verrocchio... ..everything I am.
So unless you are willing to help me find the man who killed him,
I suggest you get out of my way.
This death, it has already changed you.
Your quest has changed me!
Do you even know where you're going?
My mother's code...
It said "Book", "Home", "Child".
I thought she was talking about Vinci, but... ..Carlo spoke of another meaning.
Perhaps she was not sending you to your childhood home.
She was sending you to hers.
The Book is in Constantinople.
It is...if we are to believe your mother.
The journey before you will be monumental.
At every turn, you risk losing your way.
Then come with me.
(Groans)
There is... a port city in the Kingdom of Naples.
A place called Otranto.
In every possible outcome, that is where you will find what you seek.
We have seen the lives that you've taken in the name of a false god.
We know the man that you've become.
What do you know about the man I've become?
We have many eyes.
You've gone to great lengths to find the Book of Leaves.
It was all in vain.
The Book will never be found.
And if your faction and the Sons of Mithras and God and the devil himself want to kill each other to use it, the world will be a better place without every single one of you.
The Sons of Mithras may be tempted by the idea of the Book's existence.
But this is where they fail to see.
Man is imperfect.
Imagine the horrors they would bring unto themselves if they ever found the Book of Leaves.
What do you want from me?
We want nothing from you, brother.
We want something for you.
From the Carpathian Sea, a body of water so dense with the earth's salt, it remains untainted by life.
Girolamo.
Your vision is clouded, but in time, we will make you see.
Aargh!
(ZOROASTER) Leo?
Leo?
Hey.
Hey.
Good work.
No, it was Al-Rahim.
Here.
I'm sorry, Leo.
Andrea was...
I know.
I'd tell you to heal first but I know you've got a plan.
Carlo's headed to Otranto.
From there... (Winces) Constantinople.
It's where my mother hid the Book.
I'm sorry, Zo.
I can't ask you to come with me.
Not this time.
Good.
The answer's no, anyway.
But... if I happen to be heading to Otranto to slay the bastard fuck who killed my friend's mentor, you wouldn't mind if I tagged along, would you?
Not at all.
He deserves every inch of this.
He'll receive worse.
Ah, Lorenzo.
Do join us.
It's time to conclude our business.
Once you provide the locations of the Medici gold reserves,
I will guarantee the safety of your family.
I come bearing news from Florence.
Duke Federico of Urbino is... dead.
Impossible.
He holds the city in his grasp.
He did, until a citizen uprising overthrew him.
Led by Leonardo Da Vinci.
Mm-hm.
So in light of this,
I believe our business is concluded.
You think I'll just let you leave?
You can throw me back in chains if you wish.
But the time for negotiations between us is over.
I am no longer interested in putting you back in chains, but in the ground!
Don't do this, husband.
What Italian states will trade with us if you kill one of their own?
Something tells me, they won't all miss him quite as much as you.
(Gasps)
Bring the banker his sword.
Ever the child.
The only way out of Naples is through its king.
Kings are crowned.
You were anointed with your father's blood.
My father was a monster who deserved his end.
And you are every bit his son.
Hold!
You know nothing of leadership!
Make it quick, but know my men will cut you down as soon as you've finished.
Magnificence, perhaps you should reconsider.
I've been considering this for months.
Your Majesty?
My apologies, I have an urgent message.
What is it?
A naval fleet is heading towards the Neapolitan city of Otranto.
My liege, it is the Ottoman Empire.
Kill me... and you'll all die at the hands of the heathens.
Put up your sword, Medici.
Today the Lord shows us that the only way to fight one's true enemies is to embrace one's fellow Christians.
Do you know how far the Ottomans will have to travel before they reach Florence?
You would abandon us?
Florence is ex-communicated.
You abandoned us long ago.
Then perhaps it is time for the Lord to accept Florence back into his fold.
What the fuck's going on here?
Hey, hey, hey!
What the fuck's going on here?
Harbor's closed.
Unless you're keen to face 20 ships of bloodthirsty Turks.
Are there no other ports open down the coast?
No.
Shit.
This way.
You realize we're the only ones trying to get into this fucking city?
Look.
Carlo!
Urgh!
Aargh!
Argh!
What?
Zo!
No, no, no, no!
Where did Carlo go?
(Chuckles)
You're too late, Da Vinci, he's gone.
The last port has closed.
You had your chance but failed.
(Chokes)
Who the hell are we facing here?
My Lord, there they are.
The thorn in the side of Christendom.
Good reason, if any, to unite.
(ALFONSO) Manned with 2, 000 janissaries, trained for battle since they could walk.
The Ottomans just brought the next Holy War to my doorstep.
What resources do you have?
Four cannons, not one able to reach their ships.
And 800 soldiers.
I'll send lucrative offers of assistance to the Knights of St.John and the Order of the Dragon.
It's possible we can hold the city till reinforcements arrive.
(ALFONSO) For a day, a week.
If they breach these walls, they'll behead me like they did the King of Varna.
You must send for your Swiss mercenaries in Rome.
Leave the Church of St. Peter defenseless?
Absolutely not.
Your hand guided them here.
When the son of the Sultan came to Rome weeks ago, he brought with him an offer of peace.
A hollow offer.
You killed his men and disgraced him.
I don't recall you objecting.
If the Turks are victorious here, it gives them a strong hold to take all of Italy.
(DA VINCI) And they will.
Unless you enlist a war engineer to help.
Where's my fucking ship?
Ssh!
Give me one reason not to kill you where you stand.
You have 20 reasons not to.
Da Vinci?
The Book of Leaves?
Not yet.
I must get to Constantinople.
But cannot, with an invasion fleet in your path.
It's your obsessions that drive this.
What does that matter?
Da Vinci has many interests.
But you have no reason to believe his intentions are less than honorable.
Let's save the reunion.
What's your offer, Da Vinci?
Will you build weapons to defend Otranto from a siege?
No.
But I will help you mount an offensive.
(Horn blows)
What is that sound?
An Ottoman custom.
It means they want to talk.
No.
Lucrezia.
You would protect her?
Yeah, and you.
Let's hear what she has to say.
Does she still serve at your behest?
Is this your scheme?
Of course not.
I've no idea why she's here.
Who is this woman?
A traitor.
Used for the Holy father's machinations.
With whom you willingly shared your bed.
Lucrezia Donati?
How is it possible your mistress is an emissary of the Ottoman Empire?
Leaders of the Italian peninsula.
Bayezid II, the son of the Sultan, Mehmed the Conqueror, offers you the safety of the Italian people upon your meeting his three conditions.
That heathen dares come to us with conditions?
The first: you must cede control of the city of Otranto to the great Ottoman Empire, without resistance.
The second: all heads of state throughout Italy shall renounce Christianity, accept the call of Allah and convert to Islam.
Lucrezia, what are you doing?
The third:
your Church's Holy Father, the man who has taken the title of Pope, must journey to Constantinople, crawl across the Topkapi Palace, and kiss the feet of the Sultan.
Guards, tear out this whore's blasphemous heart.
No, wait!
Wait, wait.
Why are you doing this?
Because of him.
The man you know as Pope Sixtus is not the true Pope but an imposter.
She's an infidel.
A murderer who's made a mockery of the Roman Church and every one of you.
The true Pope, the man chosen by God, rots in a cell in the Vatican.
His twin brother.
My father.
And this monster took my... ..took my sister's life before my eyes.
He is no Pope, nor even a priest.
Lies.
All lies.
You know.
You saw my father imprisoned in the tower of Castel Sant'Angelo.
Tell them.
You know this to be true?
Tell them.
I knew the prisoner was her father.
But not the true Pope.
He never revealed his face to me.
I am the Pope, the one and only.
Anointed by God!
Do you not understand yet?
Why this is all happening, why Bayezid came to you.
Why it is I that stand before you now?
It is my father who has guided you all to this place.
No.
You'll not dispose of her so quickly.
I'll know the truth first.
Let's keep her locked under guard for now.
I demand you kill her.
Take her to a cell.
Otranto is under my authority.
And what of him?
He shall remain unharmed as well.
Any attempt otherwise, and I shall show you God's wrath.
You haven't considered Bayezid's offer.
I think I'll let my army give him my answer.
For several nights, 20 of Bayezid's ships have stood at the ready.
At dawn, you will feel the full power of the Ottoman Empire.
When it brings us all to our knees.
I suggest you consider their offer.
Have mercy upon me, O, God.
Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity.
And cleanse me from my sin.
Amen.
You believe I should run?
I am the King of Naples!
Only if you survive.
Sacrifice Otranto and you may ultimately be hailed as your kingdom's savior.
Hundreds of citizens will die!
A necessary price.
Ready the horses for Rome.
Your Holiness!
Release me.
Surely you don't expect me to number among your dead?
Perhaps you scurry away because that Donati woman's accusations are true.
You seek truth?
Perhaps your citizens should learn the real story of your father's demise.
Yes.
I thought not.
There are other battles to fight, young king.
The palace has sustained significant damage under Duke Federico.
Such is the price of liberty.
I'm sure you'll see to the restoration of the palace in due time, signore.
There is one more thing, signora.
Yes?
A substantial sum was withdrawn from the bank before the Duke's troops ever even arrived.
Orchestrated by someone with Medici signatory powers.
500,000 florins.
More than we keep in our Bruges and London vaults combined.
Now that Carlo has gone, someone will have to assume the blame.
Leave me.
Bastard.
Bastard!
(Sobs)
She's trying to take him from me.
All this document does is officially establish Giuliano is his father, thereby giving him the right to the Medici surname.
Do you know how many bastard children...
I've made my decision, Nico.
I am not signing it.
As bad as this place may be, he'd have a wealth of advantages.
He is a Medici.
His father was slaughtered for that name.
As soon as I've regained my strength,
I'm taking him as far from here as I can.
What?
It'd be better to start over some place.
You're leaving?
You said it yourself.
I'm a citizen of Florence.
A free one.
(Baby cries)
You're making a mistake.
The only mistake would be staying any longer than we have to.
Argh!
We are the horns of the increate.
We're the shadows at the center of the Labyrinth.
But we are men, not gods.
We live in flesh and blood and bone.
How many of us occupy this chamber?
Stop asking me the same question.
Girolamo.
How many of us occupy this chamber?
Four.
There are four of you, as I've told you again and again.
Aargh!
Girolamo, Icarus flew so close to the sun that he crashed to the earth.
But the fault lay not with him.
It was his father, Daedalus, the clever inventor, who built his son wings so that he could fly.
We have been tasked to destroy the Book.
For if it is ever found, well, then we will all pay for the sins of Daedalus.
What do you want from me?
For you to see what we see.
How many of us occupy this chamber?
Aargh!
(Horse whinnies in distance)
You should have never come here.
Even this far from Florence, you're still trying to control me.
I'm trying to save your life, boy.
There is a way through them.
You do not honor Verrocchio by following him to the grave.
I may not have known him well, but I believe he'd tell you the same.
If I do not reach Constantinople,
whatever happens here... it won't matter.
Our fates will be sealed.
(Distant shouting)
We're animals in the end, nothing more, nothing less.
Lorenzo and I are leaving for Florence.
You could join us.
There is no cowardice in standing down.
Not with gifts like yours.
(Cannon fire)
(Laughs) Ohh!
Gather your things, Da Vinci.
Time to return home.
No, no!
This battle can be won.
I have seen you perform marvels, Da Vinci, but this is beyond even you.
We are outnumbered by thousands.
Yes, just as the Greeks were by the Persians in the Battle of Salamis.
Look.
Say we can disable the Ottoman ships as each enters the harbor.
We create a barrier no other ship could pass, rendering their numbers irrelevant.
It'd force the remaining ships to retreat.
In theory, yes, but...
Such a thing is not possible not with the meager resources they have here.
What if we use this - a turret gun.
Enabled with your four cannons, a pivoting base which would allow it to fire on different ships and a spy glass to ensure accuracy.
My cannons can only travel half the distance you need.
Yes.
Shush.
That's why this is only half the solution.
The other half...
specialized projectiles.
We'll hollow out the center, which will reduce the weight and increase the distance they can travel.
Bore a hole?
Yes.
Bore a hole.
Much in the same way that you bore a room.
It was first attempted by Sigismondo Malatesta when he was fighting the Turks for Venice.
We then fill the hollow center with gunpowder, attach a fuse.
We will then have bombshells capable of crippling the Ottoman fleet in the harbor.
You expect me to risk...
my entire kingdom on this?
Your kingdom is beyond risk already.
What do you need from me?
Giulio?
The boy is fine.
Perfect, in fact.
Ssh.
When I first came to this palace,
I considered myself much more than Lorenzo's youthful bride.
I was an educated woman.
But I still had so much to learn.
But from the day you came here... ..you carried something deep with you.
More than just the boy.
I know it was a difficult decision.
But the things we do... we do them for Florence.
(Footsteps approaching)
It was better when I believed you dead.
I'm so sorry for everything I've done to you, Lorenzo.
You expect my forgiveness?
No.
I came here knowing this day would... most likely be my last.
Was it ever true, Lucrezia... what happened between us, what you said you felt?
You owe me the truth.
Just this once.
No.
I didn't love you.
I'm sorry.
(Gasps)
Lorenzo!
Lorenzo, you cannot do this!
We may all soon be dead.
I will not leave the satisfaction of killing this traitor to the Turks.
She may have unmasked the very man who sought to take our city.
She brought the conspirators to within a hair's breadth of murdering my entire family!
She sent me to save you at the Duomo that day.
We will not be safe until we rid ourselves of every duplicitous fucking one of them!
Cosimo intended those swords of ours to defend the people of Florence.
I am.
When you are faced with Andrea's killer... will you yield, let anyone stand in your way?
No.
Then, why, Da Vinci, why...
You still wear her ring.
You're in love with someone... utterly incapable of it.
Perhaps the same could be said of me.
Perhaps... you deserve one another.
Eventually even you won't be able to stop him.
Would you have preferred I not?
I told myself, once, once I had exposed Sixtus, relief would come.
And has it?
I didn't do this for me.
I just need you to know that.
I do.
I know.
Avenging a father... is a cause...
I now understand.
This wasn't about my father.
This was about my sister.
I wanted her life... her death to mean something.
It will.
It will.
You gave me your most... cherished possession.
I've just realized,
I never gave you anything in return.
No, wait.
You will be tried as a traitor.
Yeah.
I am now responsible, for every life in Otranto.
And that includes yours.
I don't deserve this.
Yes, you do.
Come with me.
Bayezid will take no prisoners.
I can't.
I can't.
But I give you my vow,
I will see you again in this waking life.
We are the horns of the increate.
We are the shadows at the center of the Labyrinth but we are men, not gods.
We live in flesh and blood and bone.
How many of us occupy this chamber?
We are the horns...
End this.
Do with me...what you will.
Girolamo.
How many of us occupy this chamber?
Four of you.
Girolamo.
Tell me what you see.
Four.
There are four of you.
How many of us occupy this chamber?
(Voices echo)
How many of us occupy this chamber?
How many of us occupy this chamber?
(Riario yells)
How many of us occupy this chamber?
One.
Yes.
(Riario laughing) Yes.
Yes.
(Laughs)
Yes.
We are one.
We are one, Girolamo.
You can't just leave.
You sound like the rest of them.
Clarice will eventually respect the fact you are Giulio's mother.
You're wrong, Nico.
She's not capable of respect.
Signorina?
I apologize for the intrusion.
Something wrong, Captain?
Signora Orsini.
Last night, she sent the girls to Villa del Trebbio.
She gave a footman strict instructions to deliver this to me.
Clarice has gone.
Where?
She asks that no one attempts to find her.
I brought this to you as soon as I could.
Your son is the only Medici left in Florence.
No, he's not, I never...
Yes, you did.
You did sign it, didn't you?
Forgery is no minor offense.
Of course I did.
My son is a Medici, after all.
With Lorenzo and Clarice both absent, your son is the sole representative of their bloodline.
Which makes you... as his mother... the Regent Head of the House of Medici.
And the most powerful person in all of Florence.
What does the other side of the world look like?
Different.
Did you ever consider staying, leaving all this behind?
And miss all the fun?
(Horn sounds)
(Battle cry)
The fleet is preparing.
Judging by wind speed, they should be within range in two minutes.
Right, turn it to the left.
Stop, stop, stop.
That's it, stop.
Load the cannons.
Load the cannons!
(Soldiers yelling)
Three... two... one...
Now!
The deaths that happen, have to happen.
Enjoy the view.
It may be the last thing we e6er see.
No, it cannot be.
What's wrong?
What?
Leonardo, the woman on the deck standing next to the Ottoman prince.
That is your mother.

Who are you?
Carlo de Medici,
Cosimo's son.
You'll never know how absolution soothes my soul.
There is no absolution.
Not from me.
Your only mission was to get the son of the Sultan to Rome.
Once that was accomplished, the outcome was all but assured.
If Bayezid is killed, the result is war.
If he is imprisoned, war again.
If he is dishonored and dismissed, retaliation will be required.
Carlo?
You took long enough.
King Alfonso pledges to act as the Sword of Rome, rejecting your offer of alliance.

Staunch his wounds as best you can.
We need to ensure no one else is harmed!
Carlo de Medici.
He's in there as well?
No, no.
He's the one who did this.
He killed Andrea.
No.
Are you sure?
I have to go after him.
Maestro, you're bleeding!

This space... will be your workshop, Leo.
My workshop?
The time has come for you to go out on your own.
To become a maestro.
Let your work speak for what you believe and love.
Soar, my boy, and be bold and fearless.
And the world will never forget you.
I don't know what to say.
Shake my hand and accept this.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Maestro.
No, no.
It's Andrea now.

Leo?
You should go and tell your father about this.
There's no need.
He just told me.
Andrea.
Andrea.
We've controlled the fire, signora.
All of Florence will mourn him.
Yes, they will.
And you sheltered his murderer.
What?
Carlo did this.
The man you've shared your bed with.
He tried to kill Leonardo as well.
There must be some mistake.
Several reports confirm Carlo fleeing on horseback.
Da Vinci is in pursuit.
But Da Vinci...
We must clear the streets.
Of course.
Come, Vanessa.
I'm not going anywhere.
It isn't safe here.
Safer than the palace, where I lived with a killer!
Don't make this more difficult than it needs to be.
I'm never going back.
Captain, escort Vanessa to the palace.
Do it.
(NICO) You can't force her back there.
The child she carries is a Medici.
I make the decisions for this family.
And all of Florence.
Florence is a republic.
It is her right, as a citizen, to choose how and where she wants to live.
If she believes she's better off away from the palace, you have no right...
Leave him alone.
Who are you, that dares speak so disrespectfully to me?
A citizen who knows the law.
I find that very hard to believe.
My name is Nico Machiavelli, son to the honorable legal scholar, Bernardo.
It's a pleasure, signora.
Oh, my God.
Vanessa.
Oh, my God!

There.
It's a little boy, my lady.
A male heir at last.
Lorenzo will be pleased.
Be still, Da Vinci.
You need to rest.
Are you really here?
Of course.
I reached the Vault of Heaven.
But the Book of Leaves was gone.
You lied to me.
It was your mother who lied.
To us.
The Sons of Mithras believed her an ally.
She would not be the first of our kind to falter.
Cosimo's son, Carlo.
He's a member of the Labyrinth.
He killed my mentor.
I warned you.
They will stop at nothing.
He heard my mother's message.
And now he is on his way to find the Book.
To us, the Book represents knowledge.
In the hands of the Enemies of Man, it will be a weapon more powerful than any army.
Oh, I will fix this.
Why, to stop the Labyrinth?
Or to avenge your mentor's death?
I owe Verrocchio... ..everything I am.
So unless you are willing to help me find the man who killed him,
I suggest you get out of my way.
This death, it has already changed you.
Your quest has changed me!
Do you even know where you're going?
My mother's code...
It said "Book", "Home", "Child".
I thought she was talking about Vinci, but... ..Carlo spoke of another meaning.
Perhaps she was not sending you to your childhood home.
She was sending you to hers.
The Book is in Constantinople.
It is...if we are to believe your mother.
The journey before you will be monumental.
At every turn, you risk losing your way.
Then come with me.
(Groans)
There is... a port city in the Kingdom of Naples.
A place called Otranto.
In every possible outcome, that is where you will find what you seek.
We have seen the lives that you've taken in the name of a false god.
We know the man that you've become.
What do you know about the man I've become?
We have many eyes.
You've gone to great lengths to find the Book of Leaves.
It was all in vain.
The Book will never be found.
And if your faction and the Sons of Mithras and God and the devil himself want to kill each other to use it, the world will be a better place without every single one of you.
The Sons of Mithras may be tempted by the idea of the Book's existence.
But this is where they fail to see.
Man is imperfect.
Imagine the horrors they would bring unto themselves if they ever found the Book of Leaves.
What do you want from me?
We want nothing from you, brother.
We want something for you.
From the Carpathian Sea, a body of water so dense with the earth's salt, it remains untainted by life.
Girolamo.
Your vision is clouded, but in time, we will make you see.
Aargh!
(ZOROASTER) Leo?
Leo?
Hey.
Hey.
Good work.
No, it was Al-Rahim.
Here.
I'm sorry, Leo.
Andrea was...
I know.
I'd tell you to heal first but I know you've got a plan.
Carlo's headed to Otranto.
From there... (Winces) Constantinople.
It's where my mother hid the Book.
I'm sorry, Zo.
I can't ask you to come with me.
Not this time.
Good.
The answer's no, anyway.
But... if I happen to be heading to Otranto to slay the bastard fuck who killed my friend's mentor, you wouldn't mind if I tagged along, would you?
Not at all.
He deserves every inch of this.
He'll receive worse.
Ah, Lorenzo.
Do join us.
It's time to conclude our business.
Once you provide the locations of the Medici gold reserves,
I will guarantee the safety of your family.
I come bearing news from Florence.
Duke Federico of Urbino is... dead.
Impossible.
He holds the city in his grasp.
He did, until a citizen uprising overthrew him.
Led by Leonardo Da Vinci.
Mm-hm.
So in light of this,
I believe our business is concluded.
You think I'll just let you leave?
You can throw me back in chains if you wish.
But the time for negotiations between us is over.
I am no longer interested in putting you back in chains, but in the ground!
Don't do this, husband.
What Italian states will trade with us if you kill one of their own?
Something tells me, they won't all miss him quite as much as you.
(Gasps)
Bring the banker his sword.
Ever the child.
The only way out of Naples is through its king.
Kings are crowned.
You were anointed with your father's blood.
My father was a monster who deserved his end.
And you are every bit his son.
Hold!
You know nothing of leadership!
Make it quick, but know my men will cut you down as soon as you've finished.
Magnificence, perhaps you should reconsider.
I've been considering this for months.
Your Majesty?
My apologies, I have an urgent message.
What is it?
A naval fleet is heading towards the Neapolitan city of Otranto.
My liege, it is the Ottoman Empire.
Kill me... and you'll all die at the hands of the heathens.
Put up your sword, Medici.
Today the Lord shows us that the only way to fight one's true enemies is to embrace one's fellow Christians.
Do you know how far the Ottomans will have to travel before they reach Florence?
You would abandon us?
Florence is ex-communicated.
You abandoned us long ago.
Then perhaps it is time for the Lord to accept Florence back into his fold.
What the fuck's going on here?
Hey, hey, hey!
What the fuck's going on here?
Harbor's closed.
Unless you're keen to face 20 ships of bloodthirsty Turks.
Are there no other ports open down the coast?
No.
Shit.
This way.
You realize we're the only ones trying to get into this fucking city?
Look.
Carlo!
Urgh!
Aargh!
Argh!
What?
Zo!
No, no, no, no!
Where did Carlo go?
(Chuckles)
You're too late, Da Vinci, he's gone.
The last port has closed.
You had your chance but failed.
(Chokes)
Who the hell are we facing here?
My Lord, there they are.
The thorn in the side of Christendom.
Good reason, if any, to unite.
(ALFONSO) Manned with 2, 000 janissaries, trained for battle since they could walk.
The Ottomans just brought the next Holy War to my doorstep.

Lucrezia Donati?
How is it possible your mistress is an emissary of the Ottoman Empire?
Leaders of the Italian peninsula.
Bayezid II, the son of the Sultan, Mehmed the Conqueror, offers you the safety of the Italian people upon your meeting his three conditions.
That heathen dares come to us with conditions?
The first: you must cede control of the city of Otranto to the great Ottoman Empire, without resistance.
The second: all heads of state throughout Italy shall renounce Christianity, accept the call of Allah and convert to Islam.
Lucrezia, what are you doing?
The third:
your Church's Holy Father, the man who has taken the title of Pope, must journey to Constantinople, crawl across the Topkapi Palace, and kiss the feet of the Sultan.
Guards, tear out this whore's blasphemous heart.
No, wait!
Wait, wait.
Why are you doing this?
Because of him.
The man you know as Pope Sixtus is not the true Pope but an imposter.
She's an infidel.
A murderer who's made a mockery of the Roman Church and every one of you.
The true Pope, the man chosen by God, rots in a cell in the Vatican.
His twin brother.
My father.
And this monster took my... ..took my sister's life before my eyes.
He is no Pope, nor even a priest.
Lies.
All lies.
You know.
You saw my father imprisoned in the tower of Castel Sant'Angelo.
Tell them.
You know this to be true?
Tell them.
I knew the prisoner was her father.
But not the true Pope.
He never revealed his face to me.
I am the Pope, the one and only.
Anointed by God!
Do you not understand yet?
Why this is all happening, why Bayezid came to you.
Why it is I that stand before you now?
It is my father who has guided you all to this place.
No.
You'll not dispose of her so quickly.
I'll know the truth first.
Let's keep her locked under guard for now.
I demand you kill her.
Take her to a cell.
Otranto is under my authority.
And what of him?
He shall remain unharmed as well.
Any attempt otherwise, and I shall show you God's wrath.
You haven't considered Bayezid's offer.
I think I'll let my army give him my answer.
For several nights, 20 of Bayezid's ships have stood at the ready.
At dawn, you will feel the full power of the Ottoman Empire.
When it brings us all to our knees.
I suggest you consider their offer.
Have mercy upon me, O, God.
Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity.
And cleanse me from my sin.
Amen.
You believe I should run?
I am the King of Naples!
Only if you survive.
Sacrifice Otranto and you may ultimately be hailed as your kingdom's savior.
Hundreds of citizens will die!
A necessary price.
Ready the horses for Rome.
Your Holiness!
Release me.
Surely you don't expect me to number among your dead?
Perhaps you scurry away because that Donati woman's accusations are true.
You seek truth?
Perhaps your citizens should learn the real story of your father's demise.
Yes.
I thought not.
There are other battles to fight, young king.
The palace has sustained significant damage under Duke Federico.
Such is the price of liberty.
I'm sure you'll see to the restoration of the palace in due time, signore.
There is one more thing, signora.
Yes?
A substantial sum was withdrawn from the bank before the Duke's troops ever even arrived.
Orchestrated by someone with Medici signatory powers.
500,000 florins.
More than we keep in our Bruges and London vaults combined.
Now that Carlo has gone, someone will have to assume the blame.
Leave me.
Bastard.
Bastard!
(Sobs)
She's trying to take him from me.
All this document does is officially establish Giuliano is his father, thereby giving him the right to the Medici surname.
Do you know how many bastard children...
I've made my decision, Nico.
I am not signing it.
As bad as this place may be, he'd have a wealth of advantages.
He is a Medici.
His father was slaughtered for that name.
As soon as I've regained my strength,
I'm taking him as far from here as I can.
What?
It'd be better to start over some place.
You're leaving?
You said it yourself.
I'm a citizen of Florence.
A free one.
(Baby cries)
You're making a mistake.
The only mistake would be staying any longer than we have to.
Argh!
We are the horns of the increate.
We're the shadows at the center of the Labyrinth.
But we are men, not gods.
We live in flesh and blood and bone.
How many of us occupy this chamber?
Stop asking me the same question.
Girolamo.
How many of us occupy this chamber?
Four.
There are four of you, as I've told you again and again.
Aargh!
Girolamo, Icarus flew so close to the sun that he crashed to the earth.
But the fault lay not with him.
It was his father, Daedalus, the clever inventor, who built his son wings so that he could fly.
We have been tasked to destroy the Book.
For if it is ever found, well, then we will all pay for the sins of Daedalus.
What do you want from me?
For you to see what we see.
How many of us occupy this chamber?
Aargh!
(Horse whinnies in distance)
You should have never come here.
Even this far from Florence, you're still trying to control me.
I'm trying to save your life, boy.
There is a way through them.
You do not honor Verrocchio by following him to the grave.
I may not have known him well, but I believe he'd tell you the same.
If I do not reach Constantinople,
whatever happens here... it won't matter.
Our fates will be sealed.
(Distant shouting)
We're animals in the end, nothing more, nothing less.
Lorenzo and I are leaving for Florence.
You could join us.
There is no cowardice in standing down.
Not with gifts like yours.
(Cannon fire)
(Laughs) Ohh!
Gather your things, Da Vinci.
Time to return home.
No, no!
This battle can be won.
I have seen you perform marvels, Da Vinci, but this is beyond even you.
We are outnumbered by thousands.
Yes, just as the Greeks were by the Persians in the Battle of Salamis.
Look.
Say we can disable the Ottoman ships as each enters the harbor.
We create a barrier no other ship could pass, rendering their numbers irrelevant.
It'd force the remaining ships to retreat.
In theory, yes, but...
Such a thing is not possible not with the meager resources they have here.
What if we use this - a turret gun.
Enabled with your four cannons, a pivoting base which would allow it to fire on different ships and a spy glass to ensure accuracy.
My cannons can only travel half the distance you need.
Yes.
Shush.
That's why this is only half the solution.
The other half...
specialized projectiles.
We'll hollow out the center, which will reduce the weight and increase the distance they can travel.
Bore a hole?
Yes.
Bore a hole.
Much in the same way that you bore a room.
It was first attempted by Sigismondo Malatesta when he was fighting the Turks for Venice.
We then fill the hollow center with gunpowder, attach a fuse.
We will then have bombshells capable of crippling the Ottoman fleet in the harbor.
You expect me to risk...
my entire kingdom on this?
Your kingdom is beyond risk already.
What do you need from me?
Giulio?
The boy is fine.
Perfect, in fact.
Ssh.
When I first came to this palace,
I considered myself much more than Lorenzo's youthful bride.
I was an educated woman.
But I still had so much to learn.
But from the day you came here... ..you carried something deep with you.
More than just the boy.
I know it was a difficult decision.
But the things we do... we do them for Florence.
(Footsteps approaching)
It was better when I believed you dead.
I'm so sorry for everything I've done to you, Lorenzo.
You expect my forgiveness?
No.
I came here knowing this day would... most likely be my last.
Was it ever true, Lucrezia... what happened between us, what you said you felt?
You owe me the truth.
Just this once.
No.
I didn't love you.
I'm sorry.
(Gasps)
Lorenzo!
Lorenzo, you cannot do this!
We may all soon be dead.
I will not leave the satisfaction of killing this traitor to the Turks.
She may have unmasked the very man who sought to take our city.
She brought the conspirators to within a hair's breadth of murdering my entire family!
She sent me to save you at the Duomo that day.
We will not be safe until we rid ourselves of every duplicitous fucking one of them!
Cosimo intended those swords of ours to defend the people of Florence.
I am.
When you are faced with Andrea's killer... will you yield, let anyone stand in your way?
No.
Then, why, Da Vinci, why...
You still wear her ring.
You're in love with someone... utterly incapable of it.
Perhaps the same could be said of me.
Perhaps... you deserve one another.
Eventually even you won't be able to stop him.
Would you have preferred I not?
I told myself, once, once I had exposed Sixtus, relief would come.
And has it?
I didn't do this for me.
I just need you to know that.
I do.
I know.
Avenging a father... is a cause...
I now understand.
This wasn't about my father.
This was about my sister.
I wanted her life... her death to mean something.
It will.
It will.
You gave me your most... cherished possession.
I've just realized,
I never gave you anything in return.
No, wait.
You will be tried as a traitor.
Yeah.
I am now responsible, for every life in Otranto.
And that includes yours.
I don't deserve this.
Yes, you do.
Come with me.
Bayezid will take no prisoners.
I can't.
I can't.
But I give you my vow,
I will see you again in this waking life.
We are the horns of the increate.
We are the shadows at the center of the Labyrinth but we are men, not gods.
We live in flesh and blood and bone.
How many of us occupy this chamber?
We are the horns...
End this.
Do with me...what you will.
Girolamo.
How many of us occupy this chamber?
Four of you.
Girolamo.
Tell me what you see.
Four.
There are four of you.
How many of us occupy this chamber?
(Voices echo)
How many of us occupy this chamber?
How many of us occupy this chamber?
(Riario yells)
How many of us occupy this chamber?
One.
Yes.
(Riario laughing) Yes.
Yes.
(Laughs)
Yes.
We are one.
We are one, Girolamo.
You can't just leave.
You sound like the rest of them.
Clarice will eventually respect the fact you are Giulio's mother.
You're wrong, Nico.
She's not capable of respect.
Signorina?
I apologize for the intrusion.
Something wrong, Captain?
Signora Orsini.
Last night, she sent the girls to Villa del Trebbio.
She gave a footman strict instructions to deliver this to me.
Clarice has gone.
Where?
She asks that no one attempts to find her.
I brought this to you as soon as I could.
Your son is the only Medici left in Florence.
No, he's not, I never...
Yes, you did.
You did sign it, didn't you?
Forgery is no minor offense.
Of course I did.
My son is a Medici, after all.
With Lorenzo and Clarice both absent, your son is the sole representative of their bloodline.
Which makes you... as his mother... the Regent Head of the House of Medici.
And the most powerful person in all of Florence.
What does the other side of the world look like?
Different.
Did you ever consider staying, leaving all this behind?
And miss all the fun?
(Horn sounds)
(Battle cry)
The fleet is preparing.
Judging by wind speed, they should be within range in two minutes.
Right, turn it to the left.
Stop, stop, stop.
That's it, stop.
Load the cannons.
Load the cannons!
(Soldiers yelling)
Three... two... one...
Now!
The deaths that happen, have to happen.
Enjoy the view.
It may be the last thing we e6er see.
No, it cannot be.
What's wrong?
What?
Leonardo, the woman on the deck standing next to the Ottoman prince.
That is your mother.

Carlo de Medici,

You'll never know how absolution soothes my soul.
There is no absolution.
Not from me.
Your only mission was to get the son of the Sultan to Rome.
Once that was accomplished, the outcome was all but assured.
If Bayezid is killed, the result is war.
If he is imprisoned, war again.
If he is dishonored and dismissed, retaliation will be required.

Somebody get some water!
Over here!
Leo!
Leo!
Leo!
What the hell's happened?
He needs a physic.
Staunch his wounds as best you can.
We need to ensure no one else is harmed!
Carlo de Medici.
He's in there as well?
No, no.
He's the one who did this.
He killed Andrea.
No.
Are you sure?
I have to go after him.
Maestro, you're bleeding!
Leo.
No!
We'll mount a search for Carlo as soon as this fire is out.
Let me go!
Maestro!
Sorry, artista, my duty is to Florence.
Move!
Yaargh!
Maestro?
Am I in trouble again?
Close the door, Leonardo.
This space... will be your workshop, Leo.
My workshop?
The time has come for you to go out on your own.
To become a maestro.
Let your work speak for what you believe and love.
Soar, my boy, and be bold and fearless.
And the world will never forget you.
I don't know what to say.
Shake my hand and accept this.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you, Maestro.
No, no.
It's Andrea now.
Leo?
You should go and tell your father about this.
There's no need.
He just told me.
Andrea.
Andrea.
We've controlled the fire, signora.
All of Florence will mourn him.
Yes, they will.
And you sheltered his murderer.
What?
Carlo did this.
The man you've shared your bed with.
He tried to kill Leonardo as well.
There must be some mistake.
Several reports confirm Carlo fleeing on horseback.
Da Vinci is in pursuit.
But Da Vinci...
We must clear the streets.
Of course.
Come, Vanessa.
I'm not going anywhere.
It isn't safe here.
Safer than the palace, where I lived with a killer!
Don't make this more difficult than it needs to be.
I'm never going back.
Captain, escort Vanessa to the palace.
Do it.
You can't force her back there.
The child she carries is a Medici.
I make the decisions for this family.
And all of Florence.
Florence is a republic.
It is her right, as a citizen, to choose how and where she wants to live.
If she believes she's better off away from the palace, you have no right...
Leave him alone.
Who are you, that dares speak so disrespectfully to me?
A citizen who knows the law.
I find that very hard to believe.
My name is Nico Machiavelli, son to the honorable legal scholar, Bernardo.
It's a pleasure, signora.
Oh, my God.
Vanessa.
Oh, my God!
Come on, my lady.
Push.
I can see the head.
That's it, my lady.
That's it, it's coming.
Let's wrap him up.
There.
It's a little boy, my lady.
A male heir at last.
Lorenzo will be pleased.
Be still, Da Vinci.
You need to rest.
Are you really here?
Of course.
I reached the Vault of Heaven.
But the Book of Leaves was gone.
You lied to me.
It was your mother who lied.
To us.
The Sons of Mithras believed her an ally.
She would not be the first of our kind to falter.
Cosimo's son, Carlo.
He's a member of the Labyrinth.
He killed my mentor.
I warned you.
They will stop at nothing.
He heard my mother's message.
And now he is on his way to find the Book.
To us, the Book represents knowledge.
In the hands of the Enemies of Man, it will be a weapon more powerful than any army.
Oh, I will fix this.
Why, to stop the Labyrinth?
Or to avenge your mentor's death?
I owe Verrocchio... ..everything I am.
So unless you are willing to help me find the man who killed him,
I suggest you get out of my way.
This death, it has already changed you.
Your quest has changed me!
Do you even know where you're going?
My mother's code...
It said "Book", "Home", "Child".
I thought she was talking about Vinci, but... ..Carlo spoke of another meaning.
Perhaps she was not sending you to your childhood home.
She was sending you to hers.
The Book is in Constantinople.
It is...if we are to believe your mother.
The journey before you will be monumental.
At every turn, you risk losing your way.
Then come with me.
There is... a port city in the Kingdom of Naples.
A place called Otranto.
In every possible outcome, that is where you will find what you seek.
We have seen the lives that you've taken in the name of a false god.
We know the man that you've become.
What do you know about the man I've become?
We have many eyes.
You've gone to great lengths to find the Book of Leaves.
It was all in vain.
The Book will never be found.
And if your faction and the Sons of Mithras and God and the devil himself want to kill each other to use it, the world will be a better place without every single one of you.
The Sons of Mithras may be tempted by the idea of the Book's existence.
But this is where they fail to see.
Man is imperfect.
Imagine the horrors they would bring unto themselves if they ever found the Book of Leaves.
What do you want from me?
We want nothing from you, brother.
We want something for you.
From the Carpathian Sea, a body of water so dense with the earth's salt, it remains untainted by life.
Girolamo.
Your vision is clouded, but in time, we will make you see.
Aargh!
Leo?
Leo?
Hey.
Hey.
Good work.
No, it was Al-Rahim.
Here.
I'm sorry, Leo.
Andrea was...
I know.
I'd tell you to heal first but I know you've got a plan.
Carlo's headed to Otranto.
From there...
Constantinople.
It's where my mother hid the Book.
I'm sorry, Zo.
I can't ask you to come with me.
Not this time.
Good.
The answer's no, anyway.
But... if I happen to be heading to Otranto to slay the bastard fuck who killed my friend's mentor, you wouldn't mind if I tagged along, would you?
Not at all.
He deserves every inch of this.
He'll receive worse.
Ah, Lorenzo.
Do join us.
It's time to conclude our business.
Once you provide the locations of the Medici gold reserves,
I will guarantee the safety of your family.
I come bearing news from Florence.
Duke Federico of Urbino is... dead.
Impossible.
He holds the city in his grasp.
He did, until a citizen uprising overthrew him.
Led by Leonardo Da Vinci.
Mm-hm.
So in light of this,
I believe our business is concluded.
You think I'll just let you leave?
You can throw me back in chains if you wish.
But the time for negotiations between us is over.
I am no longer interested in putting you back in chains, but in the ground!
Don't do this, husband.
What Italian states will trade with us if you kill one of their own?
Something tells me, they won't all miss him quite as much as you.
Bring the banker his sword.
Ever the child.
The only way out of Naples is through its king.
Kings are crowned.
You were anointed with your father's blood.
My father was a monster who deserved his end.
And you are every bit his son.
Hold!
You know nothing of leadership!
Make it quick, but know my men will cut you down as soon as you've finished.
Magnificence, perhaps you should reconsider.
I've been considering this for months.
Your Majesty?
My apologies, I have an urgent message.
What is it?
A naval fleet is heading towards the Neapolitan city of Otranto.
My liege, it is the Ottoman Empire.
Kill me... and you'll all die at the hands of the heathens.
Put up your sword, Medici.
Today the Lord shows us that the only way to fight one's true enemies is to embrace one's fellow Christians.
Do you know how far the Ottomans will have to travel before they reach Florence?
You would abandon us?
Florence is ex-communicated.
You abandoned us long ago.
Then perhaps it is time for the Lord to accept Florence back into his fold.
What the fuck's going on here?
Hey, hey, hey!
What the fuck's going on here?
Harbor's closed.
Unless you're keen to face 20 ships of bloodthirsty Turks.
Are there no other ports open down the coast?
No.
Shit.
This way.
You realize we're the only ones trying to get into this fucking city?
Look.
Carlo!
Urgh!
Aargh!
Argh!
What?
Zo!
No, no, no, no!
Where did Carlo go?
You're too late, Da Vinci, he's gone.
The last port has closed.
You had your chance but failed.
Who the hell are we facing here?
My Lord, there they are.
The thorn in the side of Christendom.
Good reason, if any, to unite.
Manned with 2, 000 janissaries, trained for battle since they could walk.
The Ottomans just brought the next Holy War to my doorstep.
What resources do you have?
Four cannons, not one able to reach their ships.
And 800 soldiers.
I'll send lucrative offers of assistance to the Knights of St.John and the Order of the Dragon.
It's possible we can hold the city till reinforcements arrive.
For a day, a week.
If they breach these walls, they'll behead me like they did the King of Varna.
You must send for your Swiss mercenaries in Rome.
Leave the Church of St. Peter defenseless?
Absolutely not.
Your hand guided them here.
When the son of the Sultan came to Rome weeks ago, he brought with him an offer of peace.
A hollow offer.
You killed his men and disgraced him.
I don't recall you objecting.
If the Turks are victorious here, it gives them a strong hold to take all of Italy.
And they will.
Unless you enlist a war engineer to help.
Where's my fucking ship?
Ssh!
Give me one reason not to kill you where you stand.
You have 20 reasons not to.
Da Vinci?
The Book of Leaves?
Not yet.
I must get to Constantinople.
But cannot, with an invasion fleet in your path.
It's your obsessions that drive this.
What does that matter?
Da Vinci has many interests.
But you have no reason to believe his intentions are less than honorable.
Let's save the reunion.
What's your offer, Da Vinci?
Will you build weapons to defend Otranto from a siege?
No.
But I will help you mount an offensive.
What is that sound?
An Ottoman custom.
It means they want to talk.
No.
Lucrezia.
You would protect her?
Yeah, and you.
Let's hear what she has to say.
Does she still serve at your behest?
Is this your scheme?
Of course not.
I've no idea why she's here.
Who is this woman?
A traitor.
Used for the Holy father's machinations.
With whom you willingly shared your bed.
Lucrezia Donati?
How is it possible your mistress is an emissary of the Ottoman Empire?
Leaders of the Italian peninsula.
Bayezid II, the son of the Sultan, Mehmed the Conqueror, offers you the safety of the Italian people upon your meeting his three conditions.
That heathen dares come to us with conditions?
The first: you must cede control of the city of Otranto to the great Ottoman Empire, without resistance.
The second: all heads of state throughout Italy shall renounce Christianity, accept the call of Allah and convert to Islam.
Lucrezia, what are you doing?
The third:
your Church's Holy Father, the man who has taken the title of Pope, must journey to Constantinople, crawl across the Topkapi Palace, and kiss the feet of the Sultan.
Guards, tear out this whore's blasphemous heart.
No, wait!
Wait, wait.
Why are you doing this?
Because of him.
The man you know as Pope Sixtus is not the true Pope but an imposter.
She's an infidel.
A murderer who's made a mockery of the Roman Church and every one of you.
The true Pope, the man chosen by God, rots in a cell in the Vatican.
His twin brother.
My father.
And this monster took my... ..took my sister's life before my eyes.
He is no Pope, nor even a priest.
Lies.
All lies.
You know.
You saw my father imprisoned in the tower of Castel Sant'Angelo.
Tell them.
You know this to be true?
Tell them.
I knew the prisoner was her father.
But not the true Pope.
He never revealed his face to me.
I am the Pope, the one and only.
Anointed by God!
Do you not understand yet?
Why this is all happening, why Bayezid came to you.
Why it is I that stand before you now?
It is my father who has guided you all to this place.
No.
You'll not dispose of her so quickly.
I'll know the truth first.
Let's keep her locked under guard for now.
I demand you kill her.
Take her to a cell.
Otranto is under my authority.
And what of him?
He shall remain unharmed as well.
Any attempt otherwise, and I shall show you God's wrath.
You haven't considered Bayezid's offer.
I think I'll let my army give him my answer.
For several nights, 20 of Bayezid's ships have stood at the ready.
At dawn, you will feel the full power of the Ottoman Empire.
When it brings us all to our knees.
I suggest you consider their offer.
Have mercy upon me, O, God.
Wash me thoroughly from mine iniquity.
And cleanse me from my sin.
Amen.
You believe I should run?
I am the King of Naples!
Only if you survive.
Sacrifice Otranto and you may ultimately be hailed as your kingdom's savior.
Hundreds of citizens will die!
A necessary price.
Ready the horses for Rome.

But the things we do... we do them for Florence.
It was better when I believed you dead.
I'm so sorry for everything I've done to you, Lorenzo.
You expect my forgiveness?
No.
I came here knowing this day would... most likely be my last.
Was it ever true, Lucrezia... what happened between us, what you said you felt?
You owe me the truth.
Just this once.
No.
I didn't love you.
I'm sorry.
Lorenzo!
Lorenzo, you cannot do this!
We may all soon be dead.
I will not leave the satisfaction of killing this traitor to the Turks.
She may have unmasked the very man who sought to take our city.
She brought the conspirators to within a hair's breadth of murdering my entire family!
She sent me to save you at the Duomo that day.
We will not be safe until we rid ourselves of every duplicitous fucking one of them!
Cosimo intended those swords of ours to defend the people of Florence.
I am.
When you are faced with Andrea's killer... will you yield, let anyone stand in your way?
No.
Then, why, Da Vinci, why...
You still wear her ring.
You're in love with someone... utterly incapable of it.
Perhaps the same could be said of me.
Perhaps... you deserve one another.
Eventually even you won't be able to stop him.
Would you have preferred I not?
I told myself, once, once I had exposed Sixtus, relief would come.
And has it?
I didn't do this for me.
I just need you to know that.
I do.
I know.
Avenging a father... is a cause...
I now understand.
This wasn't about my father.
This was about my sister.
I wanted her life... her death to mean something.
It will.
It will.
You gave me your most... cherished possession.
I've just realized,
I never gave you anything in return.
No, wait.
You will be tried as a traitor.
Yeah.
I am now responsible, for every life in Otranto.
And that includes yours.
I don't deserve this.
Yes, you do.
Come with me.
Bayezid will take no prisoners.
I can't.
I can't.
But I give you my vow,
I will see you again in this waking life.
We are the horns of the increate.
We are the shadows at the center of the Labyrinth but we are men, not gods.
We live in flesh and blood and bone.
How many of us occupy this chamber?
We are the horns...
End this.
Do with me...what you will.
Girolamo.
How many of us occupy this chamber?
Four of you.
Girolamo.
Tell me what you see.
Four.
There are four of you.
How many of us occupy this chamber?
How many of us occupy this chamber?
How many of us occupy this chamber?
How many of us occupy this chamber?
One.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
Yes.
We are one.
We are one, Girolamo.
You can't just leave.
You sound like the rest of them.
Clarice will eventually respect the fact you are Giulio's mother.
You're wrong, Nico.
She's not capable of respect.
Signorina?
I apologize for the intrusion.
Something wrong, Captain?
Signora Orsini.
Last night, she sent the girls to Villa del Trebbio.
She gave a footman strict instructions to deliver this to me.
Clarice has gone.
Where?
She asks that no one attempts to find her.
I brought this to you as soon as I could.
Your son is the only Medici left in Florence.
No, he's not, I never...
Yes, you did.
You did sign it, didn't you?
Forgery is no minor offense.
Of course I did.
My son is a Medici, after all.
With Lorenzo and Clarice both absent, your son is the sole representative of their bloodline.
Which makes you... as his mother... the Regent Head of the House of Medici.
And the most powerful person in all of Florence.
What does the other side of the world look like?
Different.
Did you ever consider staying, leaving all this behind?
And miss all the fun?
The fleet is preparing.
Judging by wind speed, they should be within range in two minutes.
Right, turn it to the left.
Stop, stop, stop.
That's it, stop.
Load the cannons.
Load the cannons!
Three... two... one...
Now!
The deaths that happen, have to happen.
Enjoy the view.
It may be the last thing we e6er see.
No, it cannot be.
What's wrong?
What?
Leonardo, the woman on the deck standing next to the Ottoman prince.
That is your mother.

( wind meter squeaking )
( rumbling )
( snoring )
( snoring )
Thirty long years and it's all led up to this.
My greatest achievement!
Probably should have worn pants.
Agh!
( chuckles )
Feisty, I like it.
If I finally pull this off, it will all have been worth it.
I just need to keep playing it cool.
If anyone ever finds out about this...
( scoffs ) Yeah, right.
I've come this far.
Who could possibly catch me now?
( beeping )
AGENT 1:
See there, there it is again.
AGENT 2:
We haven't seen readings like this for 30 years.
Is it coming from deep space?
An enemy weapons site?
Just as I suspected.
Gentlemen, we're going to Gravity Falls.
( alarm buzzing )
Oh, right.
Show time.
STAN:
Welcome to the grand re-opening of the Mystery Shack!
( cheers and applause )
Mystery Shack!
We're here to celebrate the defeat of that skunk little Gideon.
CROWD:
Boo!
Please, please, boo harder.
CROWD:
Boo!
But I didn't catch that pork chop all alone.
These two scams deserve some of the glory.
Oh!
Okay, okay.
Most of the glory.
Smile for the camera.
Your camera's a cinder block, Toby.
I just want to be a part of things.
Smile for a real camera.
Everyone say "something stupid."
TOGETHER:
Something stupid!
And don't forget to come to the after party tonight at 8:00.
We're doing a karaoke bonanza, people.
Lights!
Music!
Enchantment!
Phoo!
And an amazing karaoke performance by our family band,
Love Patrol Alpha.
Oh, I don't know about that.
I would never agree to that ever.
Too late, I wrote your names on the list.
It's happening.
( blows horn )
Buy your ticket, people.
You know you don't have anything else going on in your lives.
I'm talking to you, pizza guy.
Don't lame out on me.
Ha!
The town loves us.
We finally got that Gideon smell out of the carpet.
Everything is finally going my way.
Hey, Grunkle Stan, now that we have a moment,
I've been meaning to ask you for my journal back.
What?
Journal?
Oh, you mean this old thing?
It was so boring I couldn't even finish it.
( squeals )
You didn't see nothing.
Wait, you're just gonna give it to me?
Just like that?
What else do you want?
A kiss on the cheek?
I-
- I got to go.
Whoa!
I wouldn't mind a kiss on the cheek.
Not gonna happen.
Mabel, we've got to talk.
Almost losing my journal made me realize that I'm halfway through the summer and still no closer to figuring out the big mysteries of Gravity Falls.
Gideon almost destroyed the town to get his hands on this journal.
But why?
Who wrote it?
Where are all the other journals?
What was Bill talking about when he said everything was going to change?
There's something huge going on right under our noses.
And it's time we stop goofing around and get to the bottom of it.
Bro, you've looked at that thing, like, a bazillion times.
There's nothing left to discover.
Half the pages are blank, remember?
I just feel like I'm one puzzle piece away from figuring out everything.
Don't worry, Dipper.
Lord Mystery Ham is on the case.
"I play by me own rules!
What?
What?"
I don't know why I tell you things.
Do you hear that?
Hey, Mr. Pines, what's that code word
I'm supposed to yell when I see a government vehicle?
Wait, what?
Government vehicle?
The Mystery Shack is now closed.
Everybody out!
I will not hesitate to use the hose on the elderly.
Uncle Stan, what's happening?
Yeah, you never shut down the gift shop.
( doorbell ringing )
( knocking on door )
Welcome to the Mystery Shack, gentlemen.
What can I get you?
Key chains?
Snow globes?
These rare photos of American Presidents?
My name is Agent Powers.
This is Agent Trigger.
We're here to investigate reports of mysterious activity in this town.
Activity.
Mysterious activity in the Mystery Shack?
You got to be joking.
I assure you I am not.
I was born with a rare disorder that makes me physically incapable of experiencing humor.
( nervous laughter )
I don't understand that sound you're making with your mouth.
Now if you'll excuse us, we're conducting an investigation.
Investigation.
Wait, wait.
Did you guys say you're investigating the mysteries of this town?
That information is classified.
But, yes.
Look, between you and me,
I believe there is a conspiracy of paranormal origin all connected to this town.
We're just one small lead away from blowing the lid off this entire mystery.
Are you kidding me?
I'm investigating the exact same thing.
I found this journal in the woods which has almost all the answers.
If we work together, we could crack the case.
If you have evidence of these claims, we should talk.
We can talk right now.
Please, please, come in.
I have so much to show you.
I'm sorry, agents.
Kid has an overactive imagination and, like, a sweating problem.
MABEL: ( laughs ) Zing!
Paranormal town stuff, it's just part of gift shop lore.
Sells more tickets, you know.
Pop-poro-po-po.
Swag.
We have other spots to investigate.
We'll be on our way.
I'm confiscating this for evidence.
POWERS:
Smart move.
Wait!
No, wait!
We have so much to talk about.
Hold it, kiddo.
Trust me, the last thing you want around here in a party is cops.
I'm confiscating that card.
And how's about you go be a normal kid?
Flirt with a girl, or steal a pie off a windowsill.
But, Grunkle Stan, you don't understand.
And don't go talking to those agents.
( groans ) That could have been my big break.
Bro, maybe Grunkle Stan is right.
We're throwing a party tonight.
Can't you go one night without searching for aliens or raising the dead or whatever?
I'm not gonna raise the dead.
I just need a chance to show those agents my book.
Trust me, Dipper.
The only book you'll need tonight is right here.
Boo!
I say "kara," you say "oke." Kara...
Kara...
Kara...
I could do this all day.
Agh!
Well, the confetti cannon works.
( gasps )
And the karaoke machine has all the best songs.
"We built this township on rock and roll."
"Danger lane to highway town."
"Taking over midnight" by AmperSandra.
Listen, kid, you do not want to hear this voice singing.
Trust me.
Grunkle Stan, karaoke isn't about sounding good.
It's about sounding terrible, together.
( laughing )
Check it out!
These black lights make my teeth look scary.
It's like a crime scene in my mouth.
Come on, you'll love it.
( sighs ) It's not fair.
Finally I meet someone who can help me solve the mysteries of this town and Stan confiscates their card.
Dude, I probably shouldn't be telling you this, but I'm pretty sure Stan hides like everything in his room.
If I go into Stan's room, I could get in so much trouble.
Yeah, you're probably right.
That's what makes it fun, dummy.
Man, I can't wait to smash these Stanatas.
Smash!
Grenda has entered the party!
Stan's brains look delicious.
Girls!
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh, Mabel!
Is that a boom box sweater?
See for yourself.
Poke!
( music playing )
Yeah, yeah!
Work it!
Ah!
Aw!
I thought this was gonna be a rave.
Thompson, take off your shirt and make it a rave.
I'll do anything for your approval.
Oh, come on.
I promise I won't send it to anyone.
Who's got one good eye and one good pie?
These kegs are full of meat.
( giggles )
Tambry sends me the craziest text.
The whole town is showing up and no sign of those pesky agents.
Wendy, Dipper, how are those posters coming along?
Hmm.
I'll keep an eye out for Stan.
You go rustle through his weird old man biz.
( creaking )
All right, Grunkle Stan, where did you hide that card?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Ew!
Pretending I never saw that.
Wait a minute.
( laughs ) Yes!
I got it!
( dialing )
( line ringing )
POWERS:
Agent Powers.
Hi, this is Dipper.
The kid from the Mystery Shack, the one with the, um, sweating problem.
I have that journal I wanted to show you.
And you're certain this journal will help our case?
I'm 100% positive.
Very well.
We're on our way.
( gasps )
Sorry, Dipper.
I got distracted.
Kid, why did you call those agents?
I've told you once, I've told you 100 times, there's nothing supernatural going on in Gravity Falls.
Yes, there is.
After everything that's happened, you have to know that by now.
All I know is that your dumb obsession is gonna get us all in trouble one of these days.
Now go enjoy the rest of the party, 'cause when it's over, you're grounded.
Hmm.
( party music playing ) Hey, boys, looking good!
Gorney, you clean up nice.
Mr. Poolcheck, move those crazy legs.
You-
- You weird pool man.
What's the problem, officers?
Did you catch my face going 90 smiles per hour?
We've got complaints about the loudest party in town.
Three words.
We want in.
Welcome to your dreams.
( whistles blowing )
Guys, I'm so glad to see you.
Working together, we can crack all the big questions of Gravity Falls.
Trust me, this book is the lead you've been looking for.
I'm thinking full-scale investigation.
Forensics, researchers.
Do you guys have a helicopter?
( chuckles )
I'm sorry, "helicopters."
Kid, I'd love to believe you, but this just looks like more junk from your uncle's gift shop.
I mean, "leprecorn"?
I can't be the only one that thinks that it's not funny.
I can confirm.
Not funny.
No, it's real, I swear.
You should "send it to the lab."
Am I saying that right?
Your uncle was right about that overactive imagination.
We've got paperwork to do, kid.
Boring paperwork.
Wait!
This book is real.
Gnomes, cursed objects, spells!
Listen!
Uh...
Uh...
Corpus Levitas!
Uh, Diablo Dominus!
Um, Mondo Vicium!
( howling )
Huh?
Huh?
( growling )
Ha, a zombie!
A real actual zombie, see.
Spooky journal, 100% real.
Now can we work together?
Mother of all that is holy.
What do we do?
It's just one zombie.
Trust me, I see stuff like this all the time.
( roars )
( screams )
( sighs in relief )
Good thing it was just that one.
Oh, my gosh.
You guys can help, right?
Kid, we've been chasing the paranormal for years, but we've never seen anything like this before.
Get down!
( screaming )
( screaming )
Oh, my gosh.
What have I done?
♪ What up, fools?
It's Blubs and Durls ♪
♪ Making all that money and getting them girls ♪
Oh!
What do you say, guys?
Is this party legendary?
When I say Mabel, you say Pines.
( rumbling )
Mabel!
( screams ) Mabel!
We're all gonna die!
Why does that never work?
Whoa, whoa.
I think it's an earthquake.
( blows horn )
Hey, everybody, we got to get out of here!
We're all doomed.
Quick!
Into my getaway pouch!
Mabel, escape while you still can!
Wait!
No!
Don't leave!
You haven't even done our family karaoke song yet.
( all screaming )
( panting )
Dipper, what's the one thing
I asked you not to do tonight?
Raise the dead.
And what did you do?
Raise the dead.
( growling )
Get back, dudes.
This is about to get intense.
( screaming )
Sorry, one second.
You've got to admit this is pretty cool.
( growling )
Zombies!
Don't panic.
Maybe they're just a really ugly flash mob.
Dudes, stay calm.
I've been training for this moment my whole life.
With all the horror movies I've seen,
I know literally everything there is to know about how to avoid zombies.
Second thought, gonna flip the script.
Can I eat your brains?
Yay or nay?
Seeing some yay faces over here.
( shrieking )
Quick, the golf cart.
Oh, come on.
( chuckles ) That's a bummer.
Good news for me though.
Soos!
Sorry, dude, I just really want those brains.
Stay back!
Give it up, dudes.
Your fighting only makes us look more rad.
What do we do?
Where's Grunkle Stan?
How's he supposed to help?
He doesn't even believe in the supernatural.
Those agents could ruin everything.
Darn kid!
He has no idea what he's messing with.
He's stubborn.
That's his problem.
Sort of like me, I suppose.
I got too much on my mind to worry about those kids right now.
All right, let's see.
( panting )
( growling )
Take that, sucker!
This thing's a surprisingly good weapon.
We need to board up all the windows.
Okay, maybe that will hold them.
Oh!
Hi, dudes.
By the way, I taught the zombies how to get to the fuse box.
Among these dudes I'm like a genius.
Get those brains, dog.
( growling )
Dipper, isn't there something in the journal about defeating zombies?
No!
There's nothing in here about weaknesses.
( sighs ) This can't be happening.
I wanted answers so bad I put everyone in danger.
Now we're toast.
It's all my fault and no one can save us.
( growling )
No!
Mabel, I'm sorry!
Dipper!
( screaming )
( panting )
You two, attic, now!
Grunkle-
- Grunkle Stan?
I said now!
All right, you undead jerks, you ready to die twice?
( panting )
The only wrinkly monster who harasses my family is me.
Take that!
And that!
Beat it, no-eyes.
( growls )
Anyone else want a piece?
( grunts )
( creaks )
( panting )
( banging on door )
( whimpering )
( coughing )
Oh!
Ow!
Everything hurts.
Grunkle Stan, that was amazing!
Are you all right?
( nervous chuckle )
Well, at least, you can't deny magic exists anymore, right?
Kid, I've always known.
Wait.
What are you talking about?
I'm not an idiot, Dipper.
Of course, this town is weird and the one thing
I know about that weirdness is that it's dangerous.
I've been lying about it to try to keep you away from it, to try to protect you from it.
It looks like I didn't lie well enough.
( growling )
What do we do?
What do we do?
Normally, the journal would help us, but there's nothing in there about defeating zombies.
It's hopeless.
Wait, wait, wait, the text!
It's glowing in the black light.
What?
All this time I thought I knew all the journal secrets.
But they're written in some kind of invisible ink.
Invisible ink?
This is it.
"Zombies have a weakness!
Previously thought to be invincible, their skulls can be shattered by a perfect three part harmony."
Three part harmony?
How can we create that?
I have a naturally high pitched scream.
I can make noises with my body.
Sometimes intentionally.
Boys, boys.
I think you're both missing the obvious solution.
MABEL: ( on mic ) Hello.
Hello.
Does this seem loud?
Oh, Gossiping Housewives is on.
( growling )
Eh, I already sat down.
Zombies and gentlemen, I'm Mable, they're Dipper and Stan and together, we are Love Patrol Alpha!
I never agreed to that name.
Hit it!
( music playing )
Uh, Mabel, our lives may not be worth this.

TOGETHER:
Pines!
Pines!
Pines!
Pines!
I'm sorry about this, guys.
I totally ruined everything.
Dipper, are you kidding me?
I got to sing karaoke with my two favorite people in the world.
No party could ever top that.
Kids, listen, this town is crazy.
So you need to be careful.
I don't know what I'd do with myself if you got hurt on my watch.
I'll let you hold onto that spooky journal as long as you promise me you'll only use it for self-defense and not go looking for trouble.
Okay, as long as you promise me that you don't have any other bombshell secrets about this town.
Promise.
Promise.
Man, we have got a lot of zombie damage to clean up.
Where's my handyman anyway?
SOOS:
Brains!
Brains!
Holy Moses!
Wait!
There's a page in here about curing zombification.
It's gonna take a lot of formaldehyde.
Ooh, and cinnamon.
Come on, Soos, let's fix you up.
Brains!
Brains!
Soos, cut it out!
( chuckles ) Sorry, dude.
I can't believe it.
All this time the author's secrets were hiding in plain sight.
A whole new chapter of mysteries to explore.
That was insane.
I've never seen anything like it.
Who do we report to?
This is bigger than we imagined.
We need to bring in the big guns.
But they'll never believe us.
Then we'll make them believe us.
This is the town we've been searching for.
Ba-
- Ba-
- Bam.
Another zombie!
Drop your weapon!
Drop your weapon!
TOGETHER:
Oh, okay, it's just--
Who is that guy?
A very ugly man.

I'm confiscating this for evidence.
POWERS:
Smart move.
Wait!
No, wait!
We have so much to talk about.
Hold it, kiddo.
Trust me, the last thing you want around here in a party is cops.
I'm confiscating that card.
And how's about you go be a normal kid?
Flirt with a girl, or steal a pie off a windowsill.
But, Grunkle Stan, you don't understand.
And don't go talking to those agents.
( Groans ) That could have been my big break.
Bro, maybe Grunkle Stan is right.
We're throwing a party tonight.
Can't you go one night without searching for aliens or raising the dead or whatever?
I'm not gonna raise the dead.
I just need a chance to show those agents my book.
Trust me, Dipper.
The only book you'll need tonight is right here.
Boo!
I say "kara," you say "oke." Kara...
Kara...
Kara...
I could do this all day.
Agh!
Well, the confetti cannon works.
( Gasps )
And the karaoke machine has all the best songs.
"We built this township on rock and roll."
"Danger lane to highway town."
"Taking over midnight" by AmperSandra.
Listen, kid, you do not want to hear this voice singing.
Trust me.
Grunkle Stan, karaoke isn't about sounding good.
It's about sounding terrible, together.
( laughing )
Check it out!
These black lights make my teeth look scary.
It's like a crime scene in my mouth.
Come on, you'll love it.
( Sighs ) It's not fair.
Finally I meet someone who can help me solve the mysteries of this town and Stan confiscates their card.
Dude, I probably shouldn't be telling you this, but I'm pretty sure Stan hides like everything in his room.
If I go into Stan's room, I could get in so much trouble.
Yeah, you're probably right.
That's what makes it fun, dummy.
Man, I can't wait to smash these Stanatas.
Smash!
Grenda has entered the party!
Stan's brains look delicious.
Girls!
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh, Mabel!
Is that a boom box sweater?
See for yourself.
Poke!
( music playing )
Yeah, yeah!
Work it!
Ah!
Aw!
I thought this was gonna be a rave.
Thompson, take off your shirt and make it a rave.
I'll do anything for your approval.
Oh, come on.
I promise I won't send it to anyone.
Who's got one good eye and one good pie?
These kegs are full of meat.
( Giggles )
Tambry sends me the craziest text.
The whole town is showing up and no sign of those pesky agents.
Wendy, Dipper, how are those posters coming along?
Hmm.
I'll keep an eye out for Stan.
You go rustle through his weird old man biz.
( Creaking )
All right, Grunkle Stan, where did you hide that card?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Ew!
Pretending I never saw that.
Wait a minute.
( laughs ) Yes!
I got it!
( Dialing )
( line ringing )
POWERS:
Agent Powers.
Hi, this is Dipper.
The kid from the Mystery Shack, the one with the, um, sweating problem.
I have that journal I wanted to show you.
And you're certain this journal will help our case?
I'm 100% positive.
Very well.
We're on our way.
( gasps )
Sorry, Dipper.
I got distracted.
Kid, why did you call those agents?
I've told you once, I've told you 100 times, there's nothing supernatural going on in Gravity Falls.
Yes, there is.
After everything that's happened, you have to know that by now.
All I know is that your dumb obsession is gonna get us all in trouble one of these days.
Now go enjoy the rest of the party, 'cause when it's over, you're grounded.
Hmm.
( Party music playing ) Hey, boys, looking good!
Gorney, you clean up nice.
Mr. Poolcheck, move those crazy legs.
You-
- You weird pool man.
What's the problem, officers?
Did you catch my face going 90 smiles per hour?
We've got complaints about the loudest party in town.
Three words.
We want in.
Welcome to your dreams.
( Whistles blowing )
Guys, I'm so glad to see you.
Working together, we can crack all the big questions of Gravity Falls.
Trust me, this book is the lead you've been looking for.
I'm thinking full-scale investigation.
Forensics, researchers.
Do you guys have a helicopter?
( Chuckles )
I'm sorry, "helicopters".
Kid, I'd love to believe you, but this just looks like more junk from your uncle's gift shop.
I mean, "leprecorn"?
I can't be the only one that thinks that it's not funny.
I can confirm.
Not funny.
No, it's real, I swear.
You should "send it to the lab".
Am I saying that right?
Your uncle was right about that overactive imagination.
We've got paperwork to do, kid.
- Boring paperwork.
- Wait!
This book is real.
Gnomes, cursed objects, spells!
Listen!
Uh...
Uh...
Corpus Levitas!
Uh, Diablo Dominus!
Um, Mondo Vicium!
( Howling )
Huh?
Huh?
( Growling )
Ha, a zombie!
A real actual zombie, see.
Spooky journal, 100% real.
Now can we work together?
- Mother of all that is holy.
- What do we do?
It's just one zombie.
Trust me, I see stuff like this all the time.
( Roars )
( screams )
( sighs in relief )
Good thing it was just that one.
Oh, my gosh.
You guys can help, right?
Kid, we've been chasing the paranormal for years, but we've never seen anything like this before.
Get down!
( Screaming )
( screaming )
Oh, my gosh.
What have I done?
♪ What up, fools?
It's Blubs and Durls ♪
♪ Making all that money and getting them girls ♪
Oh!
What do you say, guys?
Is this party legendary?
When I say Mabel, you say Pines.
( Rumbling )
Mabel!
( Screams ) Mabel!
We're all gonna die!
Why does that never work?
Whoa, whoa.
I think it's an earthquake.
( blows horn )
Hey, everybody, we got to get out of here!
We're all doomed.
Quick!
Into my getaway pouch!
Mabel, escape while you still can!
Wait!
No!
Don't leave!
You haven't even done our family karaoke song yet.
( All screaming )
( panting )
Dipper, what's the one thing I asked you not to do tonight?
Raise the dead.
- And what did you do?
- Raise the dead.
( Growling )
Get back, dudes.
This is about to get intense.
( Screaming )
Sorry, one second.
You've got to admit this is pretty cool.
( Growling )
Zombies!
Don't panic.
Maybe they're just a really ugly flash mob.
Dudes, stay calm.
I've been training for this moment my whole life.
With all the horror movies I've seen,
I know literally everything there is to know about how to avoid zombies.
Second thought, gonna flip the script.
Can I eat your brains?
Yay or nay?
Seeing some yay faces over here.
( Shrieking )
Quick, the golf cart.
Oh, come on.
( Chuckles ) That's a bummer.
Good news for me though.
Soos!
Sorry, dude, I just really want those brains.
Stay back!
Give it up, dudes.
Your fighting only makes us look more rad.
What do we do?
Where's Grunkle Stan?
How's he supposed to help?
He doesn't even believe in the supernatural.
Those agents could ruin everything.
Darn kid!
He has no idea what he's messing with.
He's stubborn.
That's his problem.
Sort of like me, I suppose.
I got too much on my mind to worry about those kids right now.
All right, let's see.
( Panting )
( growling )
Take that, sucker!
This thing's a surprisingly good weapon.
We need to board up all the windows.
Okay, maybe that will hold them.
- Oh!
- Hi, dudes.
By the way, I taught the zombies how to get to the fuse box.
Among these dudes I'm like a genius.
Get those brains, dog.
( Growling )
Dipper, isn't there something in the journal about defeating zombies?
No!
There's nothing in here about weaknesses.
( Sighs ) This can't be happening.
I wanted answers so bad I put everyone in danger.
Now we're toast.
It's all my fault and no one can save us.
( Growling )
No!
Mabel, I'm sorry!
Dipper!
( Screaming )
( panting )
You two, attic, now!
Grunkle-
- Grunkle Stan?
I said now!
All right, you undead jerks, you ready to die twice?
( Panting )
The only wrinkly monster who harasses my family is me.
Take that!
And that!
Beat it, no-eyes.
( Growls )
Anyone else want a piece?
( Grunts )
( creaks )
( panting )
( banging on door )
( whimpering )
( coughing )
Oh!
Ow!
Everything hurts.
Grunkle Stan, that was amazing!
Are you all right?
( Nervous chuckle )
Well, at least, you can't deny magic exists anymore, right?
Kid, I've always known.
Wait.
What are you talking about?
I'm not an idiot, Dipper.
Of course, this town is weird and the one thing
I know about that weirdness is that it's dangerous.
I've been lying about it to try to keep you away from it, to try to protect you from it.
It looks like I didn't lie well enough.
( Growling )
What do we do?
What do we do?
Normally, the journal would help us, but there's nothing in there about defeating zombies.
It's hopeless.
Wait, wait, wait, the text!
It's glowing in the black light.
What?
All this time I thought I knew all the journal secrets.
But they're written in some kind of invisible ink.
Invisible ink?
This is it.
"Zombies have a weakness!
Previously thought to be invincible, their skulls can be shattered by a perfect three part harmony."
Three part harmony?
How can we create that?
I have a naturally high pitched scream.
I can make noises with my body.
Sometimes intentionally.
Boys, boys.
I think you're both missing the obvious solution.
MABEL: ( on mic ) Hello.
Hello.
Does this seem loud?
Oh, Gossiping Housewives is on.
( Growling )
Eh, I already sat down.
Zombies and gentlemen, I'm Mable, they're Dipper and Stan and together, we are Love Patrol Alpha!
I never agreed to that name.
Hit it!
( Music playing )
Uh, Mabel, our lives may not be worth this.

Duck!
Thank you!
We'll be here all night!
Deal with it, zombie idiots!
( laughs )
TOGETHER:
Pines!
Pines!
Pines!
Pines!
I'm sorry about this, guys.
I totally ruined everything.
Dipper, are you kidding me?
I got to sing karaoke with my two favorite people in the world.
No party could ever top that.
Kids, listen, this town is crazy.
So you need to be careful.
I don't know what I'd do with myself if you got hurt on my watch.
I'll let you hold onto that spooky journal as long as you promise me you'll only use it for self-defense and not go looking for trouble.
Okay, as long as you promise me that you don't have any other bombshell secrets about this town.
Promise.
Promise.
Man, we have got a lot of zombie damage to clean up.
Where's my handyman anyway?
SOOS:
Brains!
Brains!
Holy Moses!
Wait!
There's a page in here about curing zombification.
It's gonna take a lot of formaldehyde.
Ooh, and cinnamon.
Come on, Soos, let's fix you up.
Brains!
Brains!
Soos, cut it out!
( Chuckles ) Sorry, dude.
I can't believe it.
All this time the author's secrets were hiding in plain sight.
A whole new chapter of mysteries to explore.
That was insane.
I've never seen anything like it.
Who do we report to?
This is bigger than we imagined.
We need to bring in the big guns.
But they'll never believe us.
Then we'll make them believe us.
This is the town we've been searching for.
Ba-
- Ba-
- Bam.
Another zombie!
- Drop your weapon!
- Drop your weapon!
TOGETHER:
Oh, okay, it's just--
- Who is that guy?
- A very ugly man.
( wind meter squeaking )
( rumbling )
( snoring )
( snoring )
Thirty long years and it's all led up to this.
My greatest achievement!
Probably should have worn pants.
Agh!
( chuckles )
Feisty, I like it.
If I finally pull this off, it will all have been worth it.
I just need to keep playing it cool.
If anyone ever finds out about this...
( scoffs ) Yeah, right.
I've come this far.
Who could possibly catch me now?
( beeping )
AGENT 1:
See there, there it is again.
AGENT 2:
We haven't seen readings like this for 30 years.
Is it coming from deep space?
An enemy weapons site?
Just as I suspected.
Gentlemen, we're going to Gravity Falls.
( alarm buzzing )
Oh, right.
Show time.
STAN:
Welcome to the grand re-opening of the Mystery Shack!
( cheers and applause )
Mystery Shack!
We're here to celebrate the defeat of that skunk little Gideon.
CROWD:
Boo!
Please, please, boo harder.
CROWD:
Boo!
But I didn't catch that pork chop all alone.
These two scams deserve some of the glory.
Oh!
Okay, okay.
Most of the glory.
Smile for the camera.
Your camera's a cinder block, Toby.
I just want to be a part of things.
Smile for a real camera.
Everyone say "something stupid."
TOGETHER:
Something stupid!
And don't forget to come to the after party tonight at 8:00.
We're doing a karaoke bonanza, people.
Lights!
Music!
Enchantment!
Phoo!
And an amazing karaoke performance by our family band,
Love Patrol Alpha.
Oh, I don't know about that.
I would never agree to that ever.
Too late, I wrote your names on the list.
It's happening.
( blows horn )
Buy your ticket, people.
You know you don't have anything else going on in your lives.
I'm talking to you, pizza guy.
Don't lame out on me.
Ha!
The town loves us.
We finally got that Gideon smell out of the carpet.
Everything is finally going my way.
Hey, Grunkle Stan, now that we have a moment,
I've been meaning to ask you for my journal back.
What?
Journal?
Oh, you mean this old thing?
It was so boring I couldn't even finish it.
( squeals )
You didn't see nothing.
Wait, you're just gonna give it to me?
Just like that?
What else do you want?
A kiss on the cheek?
I-
- I got to go.
Whoa!
I wouldn't mind a kiss on the cheek.
Not gonna happen.
Mabel, we've got to talk.
Almost losing my journal made me realize that I'm halfway through the summer and still no closer to figuring out the big mysteries of Gravity Falls.
Gideon almost destroyed the town to get his hands on this journal.
But why?
Who wrote it?
Where are all the other journals?
What was Bill talking about when he said everything was going to change?
There's something huge going on right under our noses.
And it's time we stop goofing around and get to the bottom of it.
Bro, you've looked at that thing, like, a bazillion times.
There's nothing left to discover.
Half the pages are blank, remember?
I just feel like I'm one puzzle piece away from figuring out everything.
Don't worry, Dipper.
Lord Mystery Ham is on the case.
"I play by me own rules!
What?
What?"
I don't know why I tell you things.
Do you hear that?
Hey, Mr. Pines, what's that code word
I'm supposed to yell when I see a government vehicle?
Wait, what?
Government vehicle?
The Mystery Shack is now closed.
Everybody out!
I will not hesitate to use the hose on the elderly.
Uncle Stan, what's happening?
Yeah, you never shut down the gift shop.
( doorbell ringing )
( knocking on door )
Welcome to the Mystery Shack, gentlemen.
What can I get you?
Key chains?
Snow globes?
These rare photos of American Presidents?
My name is Agent Powers.
This is Agent Trigger.
We're here to investigate reports of mysterious activity in this town.
Activity.
Mysterious activity in the Mystery Shack?
You got to be joking.
I assure you I am not.
I was born with a rare disorder that makes me physically incapable of experiencing humor.
( nervous laughter )
I don't understand that sound you're making with your mouth.
Now if you'll excuse us, we're conducting an investigation.
Investigation.
Wait, wait.
Did you guys say you're investigating the mysteries of this town?
That information is classified.
But, yes.
Look, between you and me,
I believe there is a conspiracy of paranormal origin all connected to this town.
We're just one small lead away from blowing the lid off this entire mystery.
Are you kidding me?
I'm investigating the exact same thing.
I found this journal in the woods which has almost all the answers.
If we work together, we could crack the case.
If you have evidence of these claims, we should talk.
We can talk right now.
Please, please, come in.
I have so much to show you.
I'm sorry, agents.
Kid has an overactive imagination and, like, a sweating problem.
MABEL: ( laughs ) Zing!
Paranormal town stuff, it's just part of gift shop lore.
Sells more tickets, you know.
Pop-poro-po-po.
Swag.
We have other spots to investigate.
We'll be on our way.
I'm confiscating this for evidence.

It looks like I didn't lie well enough.
( growling )
What do we do?
What do we do?
Normally, the journal would help us, but there's nothing in there about defeating zombies.
It's hopeless.
Wait, wait, wait, the text!
It's glowing in the black light.
What?
All this time I thought I knew all the journal secrets.
But they're written in some kind of invisible ink.
Invisible ink?
This is it.
"Zombies have a weakness!
Previously thought to be invincible, their skulls can be shattered by a perfect three part harmony."
Three part harmony?
How can we create that?
I have a naturally high pitched scream.
I can make noises with my body.
Sometimes intentionally.
Boys, boys.
I think you're both missing the obvious solution.
MABEL: ( on mic ) Hello.
Hello.
Does this seem loud?
Oh, Gossiping Housewives is on.
( growling )
Eh, I already sat down.
Zombies and gentlemen, I'm Mable, they're Dipper and Stan and together, we are Love Patrol Alpha!
I never agreed to that name.
Hit it!
( music playing )
Uh, Mabel, our lives may not be worth this.

Duck!
Thank you!
We'll be here all night!
Deal with it, zombie idiots!
( laughs )
TOGETHER:
Pines!
Pines!
Pines!
Pines!
I'm sorry about this, guys.
I totally ruined everything.
Dipper, are you kidding me?
I got to sing karaoke with my two favorite people in the world.
No party could ever top that.
Kids, listen, this town is crazy.
So you need to be careful.
I don't know what I'd do with myself if you got hurt on my watch.
I'll let you hold onto that spooky journal as long as you promise me you'll only use it for self-defense and not go looking for trouble.
Okay, as long as you promise me that you don't have any other bombshell secrets about this town.
Promise.
Promise.
Man, we have got a lot of zombie damage to clean up.
Where's my handyman anyway?
SOOS:
Brains!
Brains!
Holy Moses!
Wait!
There's a page in here about curing zombification.
It's gonna take a lot of formaldehyde.
Ooh, and cinnamon.
Come on, Soos, let's fix you up.
Brains!
Brains!
Soos, cut it out!
( chuckles ) Sorry, dude.
I can't believe it.
All this time the author's secrets were hiding in plain sight.
A whole new chapter of mysteries to explore.
That was insane.
I've never seen anything like it.
Who do we report to?
This is bigger than we imagined.
We need to bring in the big guns.
But they'll never believe us.
Then we'll make them believe us.
This is the town we've been searching for.
Ba-
- Ba-
- Bam.
Another zombie!
Drop your weapon!
Drop your weapon!
TOGETHER:
Oh, okay, it's just--
Who is that guy?
A very ugly man.
Thirty long years and it's all led up to this.
My greatest achievement!
Probably should have worn pants.
Agh!
Feisty, I like it.
If I finally pull this off, it will all have been worth it.
I just need to keep playing it cool.
If anyone ever finds out about this...
Yeah, right.
I've come this far.
Who could possibly catch me now?
See there, there it is again.
We haven't seen readings like this for 30 years.
Is it coming from deep space?
An enemy weapons site?
Just as I suspected.
Gentlemen, we're going to Gravity Falls.
Oh, right.
Show time.
Welcome to the grand re-opening of the Mystery Shack!
Mystery Shack!
We're here to celebrate the defeat of that skunk little Gideon.
Boo!
Please, please, boo harder.
Boo!
But I didn't catch that pork chop all alone.
These two scams deserve some of the glory.
Oh!
Okay, okay.
Most of the glory.
Smile for the camera.
Your camera's a cinder block, Toby.
I just want to be a part of things.
Smile for a real camera.
Everyone say "something stupid."
Something stupid!
And don't forget to come to the after party tonight at 8:00.
We're doing a karaoke bonanza, people.
Lights!
Music!
Enchantment!
Phoo!
And an amazing karaoke performance by our family band,
Love Patrol Alpha.
Oh, I don't know about that.
I would never agree to that ever.
Too late, I wrote your names on the list.
It's happening.
Buy your ticket, people.
You know you don't have anything else going on in your lives.
I'm talking to you, pizza guy.
Don't lame out on me.
Ha!
The town loves us.
We finally got that Gideon smell out of the carpet.
Everything is finally going my way.
Hey, Grunkle Stan, now that we have a moment,
I've been meaning to ask you for my journal back.
What?
Journal?
Oh, you mean this old thing?
It was so boring I couldn't even finish it.
You didn't see nothing.
Wait, you're just gonna give it to me?
Just like that?
What else do you want?
A kiss on the cheek?
I-
- I got to go.
Whoa!
I wouldn't mind a kiss on the cheek.
Not gonna happen.
Mabel, we've got to talk.
Almost losing my journal made me realize that I'm halfway through the summer and still no closer to figuring out the big mysteries of Gravity Falls.
Gideon almost destroyed the town to get his hands on this journal.
But why?
Who wrote it?
Where are all the other journals?
What was Bill talking about when he said everything was going to change?
There's something huge going on right under our noses.
And it's time we stop goofing around and get to the bottom of it.
Bro, you've looked at that thing, like, a bazillion times.
There's nothing left to discover.
Half the pages are blank, remember?
I just feel like I'm one puzzle piece away from figuring out everything.
Don't worry, Dipper.
Lord Mystery Ham is on the case.
"I play by me own rules!
What?
What?"
I don't know why I tell you things.
Do you hear that?
Hey, Mr. Pines, what's that code word
I'm supposed to yell when I see a government vehicle?
Wait, what?
Government vehicle?
The Mystery Shack is now closed.
Everybody out!
I will not hesitate to use the hose on the elderly.
Uncle Stan, what's happening?
Yeah, you never shut down the gift shop.
Welcome to the Mystery Shack, gentlemen.
What can I get you?
Key chains?
Snow globes?
These rare photos of American Presidents?
My name is Agent Powers.
This is Agent Trigger.
We're here to investigate reports of mysterious activity in this town.
Activity.
Mysterious activity in the Mystery Shack?
You got to be joking.
I assure you I am not.
I was born with a rare disorder that makes me physically incapable of experiencing humor.
I don't understand that sound you're making with your mouth.
Now if you'll excuse us, we're conducting an investigation.
Investigation.
Wait, wait.
Did you guys say you're investigating the mysteries of this town?
That information is classified.
But, yes.
Look, between you and me,
I believe there is a conspiracy of paranormal origin all connected to this town.
We're just one small lead away from blowing the lid off this entire mystery.
Are you kidding me?
I'm investigating the exact same thing.
I found this journal in the woods which has almost all the answers.
If we work together, we could crack the case.
If you have evidence of these claims, we should talk.
We can talk right now.
Please, please, come in.
I have so much to show you.
I'm sorry, agents.
Kid has an overactive imagination and, like, a sweating problem.
Zing!
Paranormal town stuff, it's just part of gift shop lore.
Sells more tickets, you know.
Pop-poro-po-po.
Swag.
We have other spots to investigate.
We'll be on our way.
I'm confiscating this for evidence.
Smart move.
Wait!
No, wait!
We have so much to talk about.
Hold it, kiddo.
Trust me, the last thing you want around here in a party is cops.
I'm confiscating that card.
And how's about you go be a normal kid?
Flirt with a girl, or steal a pie off a windowsill.
But, Grunkle Stan, you don't understand.
And don't go talking to those agents.
That could have been my big break.
Bro, maybe Grunkle Stan is right.
We're throwing a party tonight.
Can't you go one night without searching for aliens or raising the dead or whatever?
I'm not gonna raise the dead.
I just need a chance to show those agents my book.
Trust me, Dipper.
The only book you'll need tonight is right here.
Boo!
I say "kara," you say "oke." Kara...
Kara...
Kara...
I could do this all day.
Agh!
Well, the confetti cannon works.
And the karaoke machine has all the best songs.
"We built this township on rock and roll."
"Danger lane to highway town."
"Taking over midnight" by AmperSandra.
Listen, kid, you do not want to hear this voice singing.
Trust me.
Grunkle Stan, karaoke isn't about sounding good.
It's about sounding terrible, together.
Check it out!
These black lights make my teeth look scary.
It's like a crime scene in my mouth.
Come on, you'll love it.
It's not fair.
Finally I meet someone who can help me solve the mysteries of this town and Stan confiscates their card.
Dude, I probably shouldn't be telling you this, but I'm pretty sure Stan hides like everything in his room.
If I go into Stan's room, I could get in so much trouble.
Yeah, you're probably right.
That's what makes it fun, dummy.
Man, I can't wait to smash these Stanatas.
Smash!
Grenda has entered the party!
Stan's brains look delicious.
Girls!
Oh, my gosh!
Oh, my gosh, Mabel!
Is that a boom box sweater?
See for yourself.
Poke!
Yeah, yeah!
Work it!
Ah!
Aw!
I thought this was gonna be a rave.
Thompson, take off your shirt and make it a rave.
I'll do anything for your approval.
Oh, come on.
I promise I won't send it to anyone.
Who's got one good eye and one good pie?
These kegs are full of meat.
Tambry sends me the craziest text.
The whole town is showing up and no sign of those pesky agents.
Wendy, Dipper, how are those posters coming along?
Hmm.
I'll keep an eye out for Stan.
You go rustle through his weird old man biz.
All right, Grunkle Stan, where did you hide that card?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Ew!
Pretending I never saw that.
Wait a minute.
Yes!
I got it!
Agent Powers.
Hi, this is Dipper.
The kid from the Mystery Shack, the one with the, um, sweating problem.
I have that journal I wanted to show you.
And you're certain this journal will help our case?
I'm 100% positive.
Very well.
We're on our way.
Sorry, Dipper.
I got distracted.
Kid, why did you call those agents?
I've told you once, I've told you 100 times, there's nothing supernatural going on in Gravity Falls.
Yes, there is.
After everything that's happened, you have to know that by now.
All I know is that your dumb obsession is gonna get us all in trouble one of these days.
Now go enjoy the rest of the party, 'cause when it's over, you're grounded.
Hmm.
Hey, boys, looking good!
Gorney, you clean up nice.
Mr. Poolcheck, move those crazy legs.
You-
- You weird pool man.
What's the problem, officers?
Did you catch my face going 90 smiles per hour?
We've got complaints about the loudest party in town.
Three words.
We want in.
Welcome to your dreams.
Guys, I'm so glad to see you.
Working together, we can crack all the big questions of Gravity Falls.
Trust me, this book is the lead you've been looking for.
I'm thinking full-scale investigation.
Forensics, researchers.
Do you guys have a helicopter?
I'm sorry, "helicopters".
Kid, I'd love to believe you, but this just looks like more junk from your uncle's gift shop.
I mean, "leprecorn"?
I can't be the only one that thinks that it's not funny.
I can confirm.
Not funny.
No, it's real, I swear.
You should "send it to the lab".
Am I saying that right?
Your uncle was right about that overactive imagination.
We've got paperwork to do, kid.
- Boring paperwork.
- Wait!
This book is real.
Gnomes, cursed objects, spells!
Listen!
Uh...
Uh...
Corpus Levitas!
Uh, Diablo Dominus!
Um, Mondo Vicium!
Huh?
Huh?
Ha, a zombie!
A real actual zombie, see.
Spooky journal, 100% real.
Now can we work together?
- Mother of all that is holy.
- What do we do?
It's just one zombie.
Trust me, I see stuff like this all the time.
Good thing it was just that one.
Oh, my gosh.
You guys can help, right?
Kid, we've been chasing the paranormal for years, but we've never seen anything like this before.
Get down!
Oh, my gosh.
What have I done?
♪ What up, fools?
It's Blubs and Durls ♪
♪ Making all that money and getting them girls ♪
Oh!
What do you say, guys?
Is this party legendary?
When I say Mabel, you say Pines.
Mabel!
Mabel!
We're all gonna die!
Why does that never work?
Whoa, whoa.
I think it's an earthquake.
Hey, everybody, we got to get out of here!
We're all doomed.
Quick!
Into my getaway pouch!
Mabel, escape while you still can!
Wait!
No!
Don't leave!
You haven't even done our family karaoke song yet.
Dipper, what's the one thing I asked you not to do tonight?
Raise the dead.
- And what did you do?
- Raise the dead.
Get back, dudes.
This is about to get intense.
Sorry, one second.
You've got to admit this is pretty cool.
Zombies!
Don't panic.
Maybe they're just a really ugly flash mob.
Dudes, stay calm.
I've been training for this moment my whole life.
With all the horror movies I've seen,
I know literally everything there is to know about how to avoid zombies.
Second thought, gonna flip the script.
Can I eat your brains?
Yay or nay?
Seeing some yay faces over here.
Quick, the golf cart.
Oh, come on.
That's a bummer.
Good news for me though.
Soos!
Sorry, dude, I just really want those brains.
Stay back!
Give it up, dudes.
Your fighting only makes us look more rad.
What do we do?
Where's Grunkle Stan?
How's he supposed to help?
He doesn't even believe in the supernatural.
Those agents could ruin everything.
Darn kid!
He has no idea what he's messing with.
He's stubborn.
That's his problem.
Sort of like me, I suppose.
I got too much on my mind to worry about those kids right now.
All right, let's see.
Take that, sucker!
This thing's a surprisingly good weapon.
We need to board up all the windows.
Okay, maybe that will hold them.
- Oh!
- Hi, dudes.
By the way, I taught the zombies how to get to the fuse box.
Among these dudes I'm like a genius.
Get those brains, dog.
Dipper, isn't there something in the journal about defeating zombies?
No!
There's nothing in here about weaknesses.
This can't be happening.
I wanted answers so bad I put everyone in danger.
Now we're toast.
It's all my fault and no one can save us.
No!
Mabel, I'm sorry!
Dipper!
You two, attic, now!
Grunkle-
- Grunkle Stan?
I said now!
All right, you undead jerks, you ready to die twice?
The only wrinkly monster who harasses my family is me.
Take that!
And that!
Beat it, no-eyes.
Anyone else want a piece?
Oh!
Ow!
Everything hurts.
Grunkle Stan, that was amazing!
Are you all right?
Well, at least, you can't deny magic exists anymore, right?
Kid, I've always known.
Wait.
What are you talking about?
I'm not an idiot, Dipper.
Of course, this town is weird and the one thing
I know about that weirdness is that it's dangerous.
I've been lying about it to try to keep you away from it, to try to protect you from it.
It looks like I didn't lie well enough.
What do we do?
What do we do?
Normally, the journal would help us, but there's nothing in there about defeating zombies.
It's hopeless.
Wait, wait, wait, the text!
It's glowing in the black light.
What?
All this time I thought I knew all the journal secrets.
But they're written in some kind of invisible ink.
Invisible ink?
This is it.
"Zombies have a weakness!
Previously thought to be invincible, their skulls can be shattered by a perfect three part harmony."
Three part harmony?
How can we create that?
I have a naturally high pitched scream.
I can make noises with my body.
Sometimes intentionally.
Boys, boys.
I think you're both missing the obvious solution.
Hello.
Hello.
Does this seem loud?
Oh, Gossiping Housewives is on.
Eh, I already sat down.
Zombies and gentlemen, I'm Mable, they're Dipper and Stan and together, we are Love Patrol Alpha!
I never agreed to that name.
Hit it!
Uh, Mabel, our lives may not be worth this.

The whole town is showing up and no sign of those pesky agents.
Wendy, Dipper, how are those posters coming along?
Hmm.
I'll keep an eye out for Stan.
You go rustle through his weird old man biz.
All right, Grunkle Stan, where did you hide that card?
Nothing.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Ew!
Pretending I never saw that.
Wait a minute.
Yes!
I got it!
Agent Powers.
Hi, this is Dipper.
The kid from the Mystery Shack, the one with the, um, sweating problem.
I have that journal I wanted to show you.
And you're certain this journal will help our case?
I'm 100% positive.
Very well.
We're on our way.
Sorry, Dipper.
I got distracted.
Kid, why did you call those agents?
I've told you once, I've told you 100 times, there's nothing supernatural going on in Gravity Falls.
Yes, there is.
After everything that's happened, you have to know that by now.
All I know is that your dumb obsession is gonna get us all in trouble one of these days.
Now go enjoy the rest of the party, 'cause when it's over, you're grounded.
Hmm.
Hey, boys, looking good!
Gorney, you clean up nice.
Mr. Poolcheck, move those crazy legs.
You-
- You weird pool man.
What's the problem, officers?
Did you catch my face going 90 smiles per hour?
We've got complaints about the loudest party in town.
Three words.
We want in.
Welcome to your dreams.
Guys, I'm so glad to see you.
Working together, we can crack all the big questions of Gravity Falls.
Trust me, this book is the lead you've been looking for.
I'm thinking full-scale investigation.
Forensics, researchers.
Do you guys have a helicopter?
I'm sorry, "helicopters."
Kid, I'd love to believe you, but this just looks like more junk from your uncle's gift shop.
I mean, "leprecorn"?
I can't be the only one that thinks that it's not funny.
I can confirm.
Not funny.
No, it's real, I swear.
You should "send it to the lab."
Am I saying that right?
Your uncle was right about that overactive imagination.
We've got paperwork to do, kid.
Boring paperwork.
Wait!
This book is real.
Gnomes, cursed objects, spells!
Listen!
Uh...
Uh...
Corpus Levitas!
Uh, Diablo Dominus!
Um, Mondo Vicium!
Huh?
Huh?
Ha, a zombie!
A real actual zombie, see.
Spooky journal, 100% real.
Now can we work together?
Mother of all that is holy.
What do we do?
It's just one zombie.
Trust me, I see stuff like this all the time.
Good thing it was just that one.
Oh, my gosh.
You guys can help, right?
Kid, we've been chasing the paranormal for years, but we've never seen anything like this before.
Get down!
Oh, my gosh.
What have I done?
♪ What up, fools?
It's Blubs and Durls ♪
♪ Making all that money and getting them girls ♪
Oh!
What do you say, guys?
Is this party legendary?
When I say Mabel, you say Pines.
Mabel!
Mabel!
We're all gonna die!
Why does that never work?
Whoa, whoa.
I think it's an earthquake.
Hey, everybody, we got to get out of here!
We're all doomed.
Quick!
Into my getaway pouch!
Mabel, escape while you still can!
Wait!
No!
Don't leave!
You haven't even done our family karaoke song yet.
Dipper, what's the one thing
I asked you not to do tonight?
Raise the dead.
And what did you do?
Raise the dead.
Get back, dudes.
This is about to get intense.
Sorry, one second.
You've got to admit this is pretty cool.
Zombies!
Don't panic.
Maybe they're just a really ugly flash mob.
Dudes, stay calm.
I've been training for this moment my whole life.
With all the horror movies I've seen,
I know literally everything there is to know about how to avoid zombies.
Second thought, gonna flip the script.
Can I eat your brains?
Yay or nay?
Seeing some yay faces over here.
Quick, the golf cart.
Oh, come on.
That's a bummer.
Good news for me though.
Soos!
Sorry, dude, I just really want those brains.
Stay back!
Give it up, dudes.
Your fighting only makes us look more rad.
What do we do?
Where's Grunkle Stan?
How's he supposed to help?
He doesn't even believe in the supernatural.
Those agents could ruin everything.
Darn kid!
He has no idea what he's messing with.
He's stubborn.
That's his problem.
Sort of like me, I suppose.
I got too much on my mind to worry about those kids right now.
All right, let's see.
Take that, sucker!
This thing's a surprisingly good weapon.
We need to board up all the windows.
Okay, maybe that will hold them.
Oh!
Hi, dudes.
By the way, I taught the zombies how to get to the fuse box.
Among these dudes I'm like a genius.
Get those brains, dog.
Dipper, isn't there something in the journal about defeating zombies?
No!
There's nothing in here about weaknesses.
This can't be happening.
I wanted answers so bad I put everyone in danger.
Now we're toast.
It's all my fault and no one can save us.
No!
Mabel, I'm sorry!
Dipper!
You two, attic, now!
Grunkle-
- Grunkle Stan?
I said now!
All right, you undead jerks, you ready to die twice?
The only wrinkly monster who harasses my family is me.
Take that!
And that!
Beat it, no-eyes.
Anyone else want a piece?
Oh!
Ow!
Everything hurts.
Grunkle Stan, that was amazing!
Are you all right?
Well, at least, you can't deny magic exists anymore, right?
Kid, I've always known.
Wait.
What are you talking about?
I'm not an idiot, Dipper.
Of course, this town is weird and the one thing
I know about that weirdness is that it's dangerous.
I've been lying about it to try to keep you away from it, to try to protect you from it.
It looks like I didn't lie well enough.
What do we do?
What do we do?
Normally, the journal would help us, but there's nothing in there about defeating zombies.
It's hopeless.
Wait, wait, wait, the text!
It's glowing in the black light.
What?
All this time I thought I knew all the journal secrets.
But they're written in some kind of invisible ink.
Invisible ink?
This is it.
"Zombies have a weakness!
Previously thought to be invincible, their skulls can be shattered by a perfect three part harmony."
Three part harmony?
How can we create that?
I have a naturally high pitched scream.
I can make noises with my body.
Sometimes intentionally.
Boys, boys.
I think you're both missing the obvious solution.
Hello.
Hello.
Does this seem loud?
Oh, Gossiping Housewives is on.
Eh, I already sat down.
Zombies and gentlemen, I'm Mable, they're Dipper and Stan and together, we are Love Patrol Alpha!
I never agreed to that name.
Hit it!
Uh, Mabel, our lives may not be worth this.

Thank you!
We'll be here all night!
Deal with it, zombie idiots!
Pines!
Pines!
Pines!
Pines!
I'm sorry about this, guys.
I totally ruined everything.
Dipper, are you kidding me?
I got to sing karaoke with my two favorite people in the world.
No party could ever top that.
Kids, listen, this town is crazy.
So you need to be careful.
I don't know what I'd do with myself if you got hurt on my watch.
I'll let you hold onto that spooky journal as long as you promise me you'll only use it for self-defense and not go looking for trouble.
Okay, as long as you promise me that you don't have any other bombshell secrets about this town.
Promise.
Promise.
Man, we have got a lot of zombie damage to clean up.
Where's my handyman anyway?
Brains!
Brains!
Holy Moses!
Wait!
There's a page in here about curing zombification.
It's gonna take a lot of formaldehyde.
Ooh, and cinnamon.
Come on, Soos, let's fix you up.
Brains!
Brains!
Soos, cut it out!
Sorry, dude.
I can't believe it.
All this time the author's secrets were hiding in plain sight.
A whole new chapter of mysteries to explore.
That was insane.
I've never seen anything like it.
Who do we report to?
This is bigger than we imagined.
We need to bring in the big guns.
But they'll never believe us.
Then we'll make them believe us.
This is the town we've been searching for.
Ba-
- Ba-
- Bam.
Another zombie!
Drop your weapon!
Drop your weapon!
Oh, okay, it's just--
Who is that guy?
A very ugly man.

Mucus.
Is there anything it can't do?
We have lift off!
Ugh...
Hand me the driver's manual.

Was gonna stop me from bagging my martian!
And is that when you realized you'd been set up?
Set up?
Like on a date?
Just can't resist the buttsquat allure huh?
Give up the alien, buttburger!
I need that back or you might recognize me.
Nice try bottom dwellers but no one touches my martin.
Ahhhhhhhh!

I don't wanna be a pancake.
Can I be a waffle instead?
Froggert, that save was outta this world!
Hey, you got it.
Just when we have to say goodbye.
We'll miss you, froggert.
Your goober, not so much.
I wish there was something we could give you.
Taken care of, camper.
I stocked the ship with all the bug chips and
Schvet vater this little hopper can gobble up.
Goodbye!
I will have revenge!
burp!
[evil laughter]
Mcgee:
Dear mom, remember how I asked you for a drum set?
Can we make that an accordion?
Whoohoo!
Awesome!
Nothing like beachcombing after a storm!
Free stuff!
Got it...
Got it...
Need it...
Yes!
Check out my sweet hat!
Ah!
Awesome!
Now I can snack and brush my teeth at the same time!
Fits like a glove!
Iee!
Whoa!
Guys!
Check this out!
Creeptastic!
What is it?
Well, it's no giant toothbrush... it looks like a chocolate bunny.
Without the ears.
Ow ow ow !
Or the chocolate.
My weird aunt irene has one of these on her mantle!
It's a tiki idol!
Well I bet aunt irene doesn't have a giant toothbrush!
Mmmmm dirty, tacky and clashes
With the camp decor!
You make those sound like bad things...
Bevare...
Dey say der tiki drum summons certain dooooom.
Ah..
Forget the doom and gloom, guys!
Just, shake your booty to the beat!
ugh!
Hey, I'm not bad!
Hey...
I'm not playing!
Whoa!
(gasp!
)
The drums of doom!
Sooo, does aunt irene's idol do that?
atlast!
Mighty tiki has been freed from his
Tacky idol prison!
Nice to meetcha, tiki, I'm mcgee...
The one who freed you?
That means I get three wishes, right?
Those are genies, mouthy one.
Still, tiki's gratitude blooms like the lotus flower.
Hmmm...
But his artistic soul droops like the
Rotting kumquat.
Whooooa!
I've got to hand it to him.
He definitely has a unique flair for exterior design.
With mother sun burning high in the sky we
Shall celebrate tiki's freedom...
With a tiki-tastic luau!
Tiki tiki tikiiiiiiiii!
Huh?
Ooooooo!
Ya!
Certain doom never tasted so good.
Like the hungry boa that feasts on the plump mouse!
Fill your bellies my new friends!
Ooooohh!
Ah ah..
Careful, campers.
Dis food is not like the tasty meals I cook...
Yaaaaayy!
Ughhhh
Nau mai!
Let the dancing begin!
Huh?
Hey!
I have no control of my muscles...
And I love it!
Luau!
Woo woooo!
It's ukulele time!
Let's get this party rockin'!
By the shriek of the fruit bat,
Tiki's crying ears command you to stop!
Not big on ukelele ?
I hear ya.
Alright.
Ex-na on the ul-ee-kay.
How about this?
Enough luau!
Now little ones, it is time for tiki to bestow a koha!
"bestow a koha"?
Oh oh..
Oookay, the outhouse is around back.
Take a left at the 3rd tree.
A koha is a precious gift from one warrior to another!
Ooooh.
That koha...
You didn't have to bring us anything.
Bring it on!
You little ones will have the honour of being
Tiki's prey in the great tiki hunt!
Yay!
We get to be prey!
Wait.
That doesn't sound so good when I say it.
Thanks for the great koha and everything,
But can we exchange it for something else?
No substitutions!
Tiki has looked forward to the hunt
For a thousand rise and falls of father moon...
So make it good!
If you survive - doubtful - tiki will bow like
Bamboo to your superior warrior spirits
And free your chieftains.
Free them?
From what?
Hahaha!
Let the hunt begin!
gahhhhhhh!
Ah-hahahahaha!
(whispering) follow me.
(yelling) encase you didn't hear him,
He said to follow him!
Tiki heeeeears you!
Haka!
gasp!
Wow.
That sneaky tiki plays for keepsies!
Run!
Drums of doom and abs of doom!
You must really work out!
Tiki thought you little ones had more warrior spirit...
You want spirit?
How's this!
?
That's more like it!
Now tiki rages with the fury of a
Thousand volcanoes!
Yeeeoow!
Dance the fire dance of really-hot-feet!
Hot!
Hot!
Hot!
Ah ha!
Awesome!
roar!
Tiki is steamed now!
roar!
Wonder what creepy
Tiki's gonna hit us with next?
Huh?
Aaaahhh!
--aahhhhhhh!
Hey - an apple a day keeps the cursed tiki warrior away.
shrunkenhead!
Can you eat shrunken heads?
No, but they can eat us!
Quick!
Into the schwamp!
We'll be safe there!
What exactly is your definition of safe?
Hey...
You guys know gary the gecko?
We're pals.
Gary's gonna hear about this!
Hope you little ones don't mind...
A few of tiki's friends dropped by...
For a bite!
the great hunt ends at last!
Let the jungle jingle with tiki's ancient victory song!
Oh'kpaullie oh'kapallie.
I guess this is it, guys.
It's been nice knowing ya.
Stay back.
I've got a stick!
I wouldn't celebrate yet, tiki!
Whooza good gator?
You want the stick?
Fetch!
huh?
Now who's the prey?
Technically, we still are.
Oh yeah!
haha!
Tiki has your scent now!
oooh?
Who da warriors?
We da warriors!
Yaaayyy!
A worthy trap, little ones...
Run!
... Worthy of a painful, tiki-fying!
Haka!
Heads up, guys!
Ya didn't say anything about ankles!
Guys!
Whoa!
Oof!
Ikki-ikki!
Good bye, mouthy one.
You fought with irritating - warrior spirit.
Mcgeeeeee!
The great mcgee hunt is on!
And maybe we can squeeze in a little game of fetch too!
The fires dim, and the hunt is over.
Time for some tiki-mood lighting...
Let them go log head!
Dip tiki's toes in lava and call him hotfoot!
Mouthy one still lives?
ahka!
(gasp!
)
Tiki has been tricked?
Huh?
Tiki is not for eating!
tarzan-yell whooop!
Oof!
Can we pretend that worked?
Hey, don't worry about ol' feather-brain.
He'll be busy for hours!
Time flies when you're about to get tikified.
Mouthy one, you have mocked tiki for the last time!
Not quite!
Um...
Er..
Yeah right.
No, no, yes!
Ahka!
I, mouthy one...
Challenge tiki to a...
Warrior's duel!
Lets trade some luau licks!
Uh, did the schwamp gas make you wonky in the head?
Tiki accepts!
Aarrrgh!
Tiki must...
Overpower...
The mouthy one!
Don't stop now, mcgee.
Do you know anything by billy blue jeans and the
Denim dudes?
Eat ukulele, tiki!
It sounds like billys jeans are too tight!
Make the plinky plink stop!
Now for the big finish!
Ahhhhhh!
Tiki's head splits like an overripe coconut...
Being hit by another overripe coconut!
Nooooooo!
Thank you, camp lakebottom!
Goodnight!
(whispering/spent) there will be no encore.
Best.
Ukulele.
Solo.
Ever!
So what do we do with it now?
What we shoulda done with it in the first, place.
Bye bye!
Whoaaa!
A tiki idol!
This'll look great on my mantle!
Oooh, cool drum.

Ryan:
I thought you were dead.
If something happened to you, that would end me.
Now you know how I feel.
So you have a plan?
I have an epic plan.
I need you, Em.
Ryan:
I want to make a trade-- your son for Joe Carroll.
I sacrificed too much, Joe.
I'm not willing to give up on you.
Can't have you running off after Ryan Hardy.
Give me my son.
Now!
Mark:
Where's Luke?
[Gunshots]
No!
It's too late!
Drive!
Max:
Mike, stop it!
Ryan:
What's going on with you?
I have Joe.
Where's the airstrip?
Mark:
Tillman Road.
We'll meet you there in 20 minutes.
What?
Ryan:
Where is he?
I don't know!
Ryan:
Joe was here.
Someone inside the FBI is helping him.
You made me give up the FBI.
Please, Jana.
I'm here for you when you need anything.
You've been so good to me.
They killed my son.
Carroll:
You are getting exactly what you deserved.
Aah!
I'm done with you, Lily.
Good-bye.
We're here.
_
Should we call somebody, let them know we're here?
Oh.
They know we're here.
Creepy.
How well do you know this Robert guy?
He already told you that.
Am I talking to you?
Hey, hey, girls.
We're all tired.
Let's not fight, huh?
Robert is an old friend, and he lives here with his friends.
So... what is the plan once we get inside?
Meet our host, figure out the hierarchy, feel our way, you know?
What kind of cult is this?
I hear they're quite a peaceful lot.
Roderick identified them as a vulnerable group, easily swayed.
And Robert has paved the way?
Yeah.
He seemed very enthusiastic.
Tell you the truth, I don't know Robert all that well.
He visited me a couple of times in prison, but he was very much Roderick's recruit.
Then ultimately, he never made it to Havenport, so we're kind of winging it here.
[Car approaching]
Somebody's coming.
Hey, Robert.
I'm sorry we're so late.
Sorry, Joe.
I wanted to bring you in a different way.
Hey.
Whoa!
All of you, on your knees!
I-
- I'm sorry?
It's ok.
You can trust us.
Woman:
Shut up, Robert.
If you want to enter, you must humble yourselves.
On your knees, hands behind your back now.
Ok.
Let's, uh-- let's do as the nice people ask.
Joe Carroll.
So it really is you.
Oh, yes, it's me.
Are you in charge here?
Can I have a word--
Joe!
[Coughs]
There's-- there's really no need for that.
I know out in the world you're a big deal with a killer cult and a bunch of followers, but in here, you are the follower.
[Grunts]
No!
Joe!
Man:
Go.
Get in the van!
[Indistinct chatter]
Woman:
Mr. Hardy, Mr. Hardy, Mr. Hardy!
Will you confirm your involvement in the search for Lily Gray?
Do you have anything to say?
People want to know what's going on.
[Cameras clicking]
Thanks for coming in, Mr. Hardy.
How's your wound?
I'll heal.
What can I do for you?
Well, I'm inclined to believe you.
About what?
That you saw Joe Carroll and that he is, in fact, alive and that he knew we were on to him.
Someone warned him not to get on that plane.
According to the pilot, he received a phone call just prior.
I went to the evidence warehouse in Virginia where Carroll's physical DNA was being stored, and it's possible that his DNA had been swapped.
That means that he would have someone inside the Bureau this entire time.
Any ideas on who that may be?
I need to know.
I cannot trust anyone.
Well, by your own logic, how can I trust you?
You're facing federal charges.
The only reason you're not in jail is because Director Franklin wanted to minimize the fallout.
However, there will be repercussions.
Gina, right?
Feel free to arrest me whenever you like, but till then...
You know, I actually like you.
I even respect your need to do this without the Bureau's help, but you put the people that you care about in danger, and I don't understand or respect that.
Mike, did you get my message?
They interview Luke yet?
He's not talking.
Everyone thinks Lily left the country.
DC found several different properties in various countries all linked to her.
Yeah, but she prepared for this.
Not gonna find her through the records.
Can you get me in to see Luke?
Maybe I can get him to talk.
No.
Uh, I'm leaving.
What?
I'm going home, Ryan.
I'm done.
Mike, wait.
Get out!
Move!
Mandy:
Joe, are you still there?
Carroll:
Still here, mouse.
It's gonna be fine.
Divest yourself of all your clothing and possessions and place them in a barrel.
What?
Emma:
She wants us to take off our clothes.
No.
It's all good.
Go ahead.
It's time for you to lose what you learned outside these walls.
Shower.
Cleanse yourself.
Divest.
Mike:
I asked to go.
I want to go.
Why?
I lost control.
I almost killed Luke.
He was trying to kill you.
You weren't there, Ryan.
I did a lot more than that.
I lost it.
I thought I was ready for this.
I thought... coming back would somehow help me.
A lot's happened in the past year--
Havenport...
Debra.
And, um, I've had some problems with my friends, my family.
I don't respond to normal situations... appropriately.
I can fake it most of the time.
Then I cloud over.
My dad won't talk to me.
He-- he doesn't get it.
Can you talk to somebody else?
I have.
I've talked to therapists,
I've talked to counselors.
I need to go, Ryan.
My flight's in the morning.
It's for the best.
Ryan:
For how long?
For 6 months or until this case is over, but I'm not going back to the Intel Division.
I'm so sorry, Max.
I didn't lose my career yet.
I got suspended.
- What if I call somebody at the Bureau?
- Don't, ok?
I knew the deal.
I'm ok with this.
What are you gonna do?
I'm more worried about what you're gonna do.
It's time to rethink this, what you've been doing, what we've all been doing.
I'm fine.
No.
You're obsessed, but go ahead and dodge the issue.
I'm not dodging anything, but I'm not gonna stop.
I can't.
Sure you can.
You make the decision right this moment.
You go back to teaching, you-- you forget about all of this.
I withdrew of the semester.
Look.
I'm not gonna lie to you, Max.
I can't, not after everything you've done for me, but I have to be the one to find him.
You mean to kill him.
Yeah.
I mean to kill him.
I stopped drinking so I could get clear-headed enough to find him, so I could get healthy enough to hunt him.
I started teaching because I knew it would anger him.
So this life you see, it's all for him.
So am I obsessed?
Yeah, I am, and I'm ok with it.
Maybe this new life was for Carroll, but it doesn't have to be anymore.
This is your life, Ryan, and it's very real.
You have a family-- me-- who loves you.
Just think about it, please.
Man on PA:
Korban-- love, unity, peace.
We are one.
Korban is family,
Korban is love.
Korban forever.
You can call me Julia for now.
We have beds set up for you in the main dorm.
Carroll:
And what is your role here, Julia?
I assist Micah in all areas of operation,
I'm his wife and lead deacon.
Why do we have to wear these masks?
Because you haven't earned an identity yet.
I don't see much identity here.
I see conformity.
Emma.
What you see is unity.
You see community and spirit.
It's sad that you don't recognize that, Emma.
[Whispering] Micah wants to see Joe.
It appears Micah has requested your presence.
Robert will take you.
Don't fear me, girls.
I'm not your enemy, I'm your champion.
Come on.
I'll show you around.
Let's go.
Man:
What did I tell you, huh?
What did I tell you?
You told me not to drink in the car.
That's right, and look what you did.
You're gonna clean it up!
Ok.
I'll do it.
Aah!
I've had it with you.
Look what you did!
You are such a spoiled brat!
Come on!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Ow!
That hurts!
Hey!
Is there a problem here?
This is family business.
Stay out of it!
Shut up!
NYPD!
Step away from the boy.
Step away!
- Police?
- Stay back.
Are you all right, son?
Smile, Miss Hardy.
[Grunting]
Did I do good?
You did great, son.
Great.
[Cell phone vibrating]
Hello, Ryan.
I'm sorry it's come to this, but I don't know any other way to express what my loss feels like.
You take from me,
I take from you.
[Indistinct chatter]
[Women giggling]
You wanted to see us?
Micah:
Oh, yes.
Thank you, girls.
Beautiful work.
We'll continue tomorrow.
Blessed be the children.
I'm Micah.
It's nice to meet you.
Robert, you wait outside.
I want to do some private bonding with our new friend.
Ok.
You guys, too.
I'll scream if our guest gets all alpha on me.
Take off the mask.
Yep.
That's really you.
Damn.
It's good to meet you, Micah.
You may not sit at my table.
No.
No.
Of course not.
How presumptuous of me.
So, Joe Carroll, you're a dead man.
How'd you pull that off?
Oh, it's-- it's all in the details.
So you faked it.
As opposed to?
So cool what you did last year with your-- with your cult.
Mad props.
I was impressed the way you organized and gathered all your followers.
Dude, how did you get them to kill for you?
I've always had an innate ability to-- to connect with people.
So I'm guessing you're looking for a place to hide out,
Korban is your crib of choice.
I'm interested in more than just refuge.
What can you offer me, Joe?
You're, like, the world's most deadly killer.
Why would I welcome you into my kingdom?
$30,000 in a bag in my car.
Yep.
Got it.
Thank you for your donation.
What else?
I think, given the chance,
I could be of great help to both you and your cause.
How so?
You tell me.
Surely you must have something in mind.
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here.
Heh heh!
I could find some use for you, but the question is your commitment and can I trust you?
This is the Micah show here, and you need to be down with that, but are you?
I need your help, Micah.
I offer you my humble service in exchange for-- for your hospitality.
Mendez:
Ryan, I'm sorry about Max.
Anything?
Lawrence:
Lily Gray's e-mail was tracked to a coffee shop just outside Boston.
Open wi-fi.
Whoever sent it didn't even have to get out of their car.
Any witnesses to Max's abduction?
It happened right outside her apartment.
Garage was already processed.
Security cameras were disabled.
No eye witnesses.
Ok.
We know the abductor was using an SUV, late seventies model, male on camera wearing a brown work jacket, flannel shirt.
All right, everybody.
Eyes up.
We're looking for two suspects.
We got camera footage from both corners near her apartment.
Hey.
I thought you left.
Mendez called me.
I'm here, Ryan.
Thank you.
Mendez:
Ryan, what time did she leave your place?
Uh, it was around 2:00.
She said she was heading home.
That puts her home near just after 2:30.
Let's go.
There!
Work jacket, flannel shirt.
Mike:
What about the license plate?
It's been taped over.
That's the best I can do.
Well, put it through facial recognition.
Come on.
There's a person that could help us-
- Luke.
Lily sent this guy to punish me for Luke.
He would know who he is, where Lily is.
Luke would know.
Well, he's recovering because he was almost killed, and he's refusing to talk.
Let me try.
Max is not dead, or it would be on that tape, and it's not.
We are wasting time.
Please, Gina.
[Gasps]
Hi.
Nice to meet you, Max.
Is that a tattoo?
[Grunting]
Well, isn't that something?
Do you have any more?
Where-- where am I?
Look at this.
Heh heh.
It's a butterfly.
I've got lots of tattoos.
I really like this one.
It's pretty, right?
Come on.
Tell me.
Do you have any more tattoos?
_
[Buzzer]
Ryan:
Hey!
I came to see you, but first, they have to secure me.
They don't trust me.
Anger issues.
[Buzzer]
So... how you feeling?
Listen.
I'm sorry about Giselle, but she was trying to kill me.
I mean, you can't hold that against me.
I mean, what would you do in my situation, huh?
What do you want?
I need your help, Luke, and I know you have no reason to help me, but I really hope that you will.
I'm not gonna help you find my mother.
This is not about your mother.
She really liked you, you know?
Aw.
That's so nice to hear, but I need your help finding this guy.
Ooh.
Ooh, ooh.
You don't want find that guy.
He's bad news.
If you're looking for him, you must be in real trouble.
Why is that?
A little too gory for my mom's taste.
So your mom knows him?
My mom knows lots of people, Ryan.
She's been looking for the right guy for a really, really long time, and they're not all princes.
There's a lot of toads out there.
So... your mom was auditioning killers?
Ha!
No, no, no, no.
No, not killers, Ryan.
People.
She just wants to be loved like everybody else.
She just wants someone to understand her and accept her for who she is.
I mean, no one wants to be alone.
So where can I find this guy?
You already know him.
Everybody does.
What's his name?
Why do you need to know his--
[Laughs]
I know what's happening.
Ha!
Mom got clever.
Tit for tat.
Oh.
This guy, he's hot for my mom.
He'll do anything for her.
[Laughs] What did he do?
Ooh!
Who is he?
His name's Kurt something or other.
I don't know his last name, but... you know him as The Huntsman.
Mike:
The Huntsman is a known serial killer of women, all prostitutes.
He's believed to be in the Northeast Coast region of the country.
He's been evading Quantico for years-- no eye witnesses, no survivors.
Now the victim's time of death is roughly 24 hours after their abduction.
They're all killed with a high-velocity bow.
I see a lot of superficial cuts on their faces, arms, legs.
Yeah, we believe those were sustained while they ran for their lives through the woods.
He hunted them like prey.
He's a mission killer.
He's ridding the world of sin.
He hunts them, he guts them, he skins them.
We know what he looks like.
Mendez:
And we've got a first name.
Kurt.
Come on, guys.
We've only got 12 hours if he sticks to this MO.
I need those DMV records.
Max is not his typical victim.
He may be following different methods.
Lawrence:
I have a match.
Kurt Bolen of Trenton, New Jersey.
That's him.
Let's go!
Carroll:
What is this?
The reckoning.
It's perfectly safe.
Right.
All community members have been through the reckoning many times.
This works better if you remain still.
Ok.
May I?
Of course.
I'm gonna ask you a series of questions.
These electrodes will measure your blood pressure, breathing rate, and body temp.
Oh.
So it's a glorified lie detector.
Mmm.
I should warn you that these machines tend not to work terribly well on people with my psychological profile.
You mean sociopaths?
Psychopaths?
Oh.
Who wants to be reduced to a label, hmm?
People of your ilk may respond differently, but they do respond.
A response that allows you to determine truthfulness?
I'm very good at this.
Oh.
Let me just get a level.
Your name is Joe Carroll?
Yes.
Did you like the view of my breasts when I leaned over?
No.
See?
It works.
Liar.
[Chuckles]
Shall we begin?
By all means.
[Sirens]
Move in, move in!
Ohh!
Don't move!
Hands up!
Is Kurt Bolen your husband?
Where is he?
Where is he?
!
He w-went away for a few days.
Boy:
Mom!
Come here.
We don't have time for this.
I know that this is difficult to accept, but we need your help.
No.
I told you.
He's traveling for work.
He sells office supplies.
Mike:
We checked.
There's no business trip.
What?
No.
This is impossible.
Come on, Shannon.
Don't be that wife.
You know it's true.
Boy:
Hey!
Shut up!
You don't know my dad.
Chris!
You don't know him.
Yeah.
Look at that camera angle.
Max is about 5'8".
That camera's shooting up at her from below.
You think whoever shot this was shorter than her.
By about a foot.
Hey.
You can't just come in here.
This is my room.
Where's your father, Chris?
What?
Where is your father?
Why are you asking me?
Because I think you shot that.
No, I didn't.
You see that girl?
That's my niece.
That's my family, and I'm not gonna let your sick, twisted father kill my niece.
Is she a whore?
Heh.
My dad hates whores.
He, uh, gives them what they deserve.
Chris:
Mom, help!
Help!
Stop!
Mendez:
Ryan, Mike?
Open the door!
Stop!
Mom, help!
Open up!
I said open up!
Kurt has a cabin near Black River.
We have an address.
We need a search team at the following location.
Take that kid in for questioning.
[Grunts]
Why do you murder?
I thought these machines only worked with yes or no questions.
Evasive.
I have a need that cannot be denied.
Have you reformed?
I don't believe I need to reform.
Have you murdered anyone in the last week?
Oh, yes.
Describe to me the feeling you get when you take a life.
It's... phew-- very hard to describe.
Is it sexual?
Very.
How so?
I'll have to show you sometime.
Why are you here?
What do you want?
I want to become part of Micah's flock.
Is that true?
Yes.
That's your only motive for being here?
Yes.
I wish to start anew, become something new.
I...
I want a new life.
We're done.
You can release him.
You gonna tell me how I did?
You know what the truth is, Joe.
How did you do?
Hmm.
Man on PA:
Love, unity, peace.
We are one.
Korban is family, Korban is love.
And?
He's all truth, Micah.
Man on PA:
Love, unity, peace.
We are one.
Korban is family.
Korban is love...
[Sighs]
So where's your son?
He has school tomorrow.
I know who you are.
I would expect you to.
So how's this work, huh?
I'm not much of a hunt tied up.
I'm doing a favor for a friend, so we are going to skip the hunt and move immediately to the after party.
A friend?
Is her-- is her name Lily?
Ah.
Look at you, Miss Smarty Pants.
You-- you don't want to skip the hunt.
No more talking.
You could do her a favor, but don't be less than you are.
What do you mean?
Hunt... me.
Come on!
I'm a challenge!
You hunt hookers and drug addicts.
How hard is that?
I run a mile in under 6 minutes,
I'm a trained paramilitary officer.
Hunt me!
I am being paid to kill you here like this.
Yeah, but if you're as good as you claim, what difference does it make?
You're just gonna kill me anyway.
I could be a prize trophy to brag to your son about.
Hmm?
No deal.
All right, bitch.
You asked for it.
[Sirens]
Check that door!
Are we too late?
No.
There's nothing on the camera.
There was a struggle.
Get the K-9 unit moving!
Move out, move out!
[Barking]
[Tape ripping]
Sit here.
Please explain, Robert.
What exactly is this?
It's for you.
We're going to celebrate our new recruits.
You'll enjoy it.
It's fun.
Are we ok here?
Yes, very.
[Drums play]
I think.
[Boom]
[Boom]
[Boom]
[Boom]
[Boom]
[Boom]
[Boom]
[Boom]
[Boom]
[Boom]
[Boom]
[Boom boom]
All right, man.
Find her, find her!
[Barking]
[Barking]
What is it?
This way.
He has the scent now.
This way.
Come on.
Mike.
Mike!
Max!
Thank God.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You ok?
Yeah.
[Gunshots]
[Dogs barking]
I knew you'd come.
[Crying]
I knew you'd come.
Micah:
Tonight, we rejoice, family.
We cleanse ourselves of sin.
With the blood of one, we may wash away the sins of many, and we will be one step closer to... going home.
Crowd: ♪ Ohh ♪
[Drum plays]
[Cheering and applause]
Let me, Micah!
Where's home?
Hell if I know.
Micah:
Who among you is ready to make the sacrifice?
Choose me!
Choose me!
Through God's will, the choice will be made.
[Crowd clamoring]
You.
Joe.
Joe!
Joe!
Micah:
Bless you, child, for God has chosen you today!
The Lord has spoken!
His will must be done.
No, Micah, please!
We must trust each other.
Emma:
No!
Joe!
Joe!
[Cheering]
Joe!
[Screams]
[Laughs]
No!
No.
No!
Joe!
Joe!
Joe!
Help me!
Ahh!
Joe!
[Emma whimpering]
Joe, what are they doing?
No!
No!
No!
For our sins!
Emma:
Oh, my God!
Carroll:
No!
Micah!
[Screams]
[Laughs]
[Cheering]
Micah:
Through her blood, we are saved.
No, no!
[Laughs]
[Door opens]
You wanted to see me?
Why did you do it?
I only did what I was compelled to do.
The Spirit spoke through me, Joe.
Emma is alive.
You'll see her soon.
No, no, no.
You targeted Emma on purpose to weaken me.
You've never used a little subterfuge in the name of truth?
I think it was a necessary introduction to our ways.
You're scared of me.
What happened?
I fail your little lie detector test, or did I pass it?
You're here because my husband wants you here, but don't think for a second I trust you.
Mendez:
Anything on Bolen's phone?
No.
Are you staying?
I'm leaving in the morning.
Hey.
- How's Max?
- She's good.
[Cell phone vibrating]
Lily just sent me a text.
It's another link to a video.
All right.
Let's get it up on the big screen.
Hey, Hopkins.
Lily:
Hello, Ryan.
Mendez:
Is this live?
Hopkins:
No.
It's time-stamped a few hours ago.
Where is she?
House, dining room, where?
Lily:
I'm sorry about your niece.
She must be a terrible loss in your life.
She doesn't realize you saved her.
I have one more surprise.
You weren't the only one to hurt me, Ryan.
Another was involved, and he must pay for what he...
I know that place.
That's my dad's house.
...did to Luke.
She's in his living room.
Oh, my God.
Say hello to your son, Richard.
Go to hell.
All right.
Somebody, help.
344 Cherokee Lane,
Hampton, Virginia, now!
Such a hard man.
All right.
- Now!
- Go ahead, Mark.
Ryan:
Stop the video.
Stop it!
Mike, Mike.
[Richard gagging]
No.
No.
No.
Get off me, get off me!
Lily:
I have many more surprises for you, Ryan.
Get ready.
[Crying]
Mike.
Oh, Mike.
He's gone.
He's gone.
Oh, my God.
No, no, no, no.
_
I thought you were dead.
If something happened to you, that would end me.
Now you know how I feel.
So you have a plan?
I have an epic plan.
I need you, Em.
I want to make a trade-- your son for Joe Carroll.
I sacrificed too much, Joe.
I'm not willing to give up on you.
Can't have you running off after Ryan Hardy.
Give me my son.
Now!
Where's Luke?
No!
It's too late!
Drive!
Mike, stop it!
What's going on with you?
I have Joe.
Where's the airstrip?
Tillman Road.
We'll meet you there in 20 minutes.
What?
Where is he?
I don't know!
Joe was here.
Someone inside the FBI is helping him.
You made me give up the FBI.
Please, Jana.
I'm here for you when you need anything.
You've been so good to me.
They killed my son.
You are getting exactly what you deserved.
Aah!
I'm done with you, Lily.
Good-bye.
We're here.
_
Should we call somebody, let them know we're here?
Oh.
They know we're here.
Creepy.
How well do you know this Robert guy?
He already told you that.
Am I talking to you?
Hey, hey, girls.
We're all tired.
Let's not fight, huh?
Robert is an old friend, and he lives here with his friends.
So... what is the plan once we get inside?
Meet our host, figure out the hierarchy, feel our way, you know?
What kind of cult is this?
I hear they're quite a peaceful lot.
Roderick identified them as a vulnerable group, easily swayed.
And Robert has paved the way?
Yeah.
He seemed very enthusiastic.
Tell you the truth, I don't know Robert all that well.
He visited me a couple of times in prison, but he was very much Roderick's recruit.
Then ultimately, he never made it to Havenport, so we're kind of winging it here.
Somebody's coming.
Hey, Robert.
I'm sorry we're so late.
Sorry, Joe.
I wanted to bring you in a different way.
Hey.
Whoa!
All of you, on your knees!
I-
- I'm sorry?
It's ok.
You can trust us.
Shut up, Robert.
If you want to enter, you must humble yourselves.
On your knees, hands behind your back now.
Ok.
Let's, uh-- let's do as the nice people ask.
Joe Carroll.
So it really is you.
Oh, yes, it's me.
Are you in charge here?
Can I have a word--
Joe!
There's-- there's really no need for that.
I know out in the world you're a big deal with a killer cult and a bunch of followers, but in here, you are the follower.
No!
Joe!
Go.
Get in the van!
Mr. Hardy, Mr. Hardy, Mr. Hardy!
Will you confirm your involvement in the search for Lily Gray?
Do you have anything to say?
People want to know what's going on.
Thanks for coming in, Mr. Hardy.
How's your wound?
I'll heal.
What can I do for you?
Well, I'm inclined to believe you.
About what?
That you saw Joe Carroll and that he is, in fact, alive and that he knew we were on to him.
Someone warned him not to get on that plane.
According to the pilot, he received a phone call just prior.
I went to the evidence warehouse in Virginia where Carroll's physical DNA was being stored, and it's possible that his DNA had been swapped.
That means that he would have someone inside the Bureau this entire time.
Any ideas on who that may be?
I need to know.
I cannot trust anyone.
Well, by your own logic, how can I trust you?
You're facing federal charges.
The only reason you're not in jail is because Director Franklin wanted to minimize the fallout.
However, there will be repercussions.
Gina, right?
Feel free to arrest me whenever you like, but till then...
You know, I actually like you.
I even respect your need to do this without the Bureau's help, but you put the people that you care about in danger, and I don't understand or respect that.
Mike, did you get my message?
They interview Luke yet?
He's not talking.
Everyone thinks Lily left the country.
DC found several different properties in various countries all linked to her.
Yeah, but she prepared for this.
Not gonna find her through the records.
Can you get me in to see Luke?
Maybe I can get him to talk.
No.
Uh, I'm leaving.
What?
I'm going home, Ryan.
I'm done.
Mike, wait.
Get out!
Move!
Joe, are you still there?
Still here, mouse.
It's gonna be fine.
Divest yourself of all your clothing and possessions and place them in a barrel.
What?
She wants us to take off our clothes.
No.
It's all good.
Go ahead.
It's time for you to lose what you learned outside these walls.
Shower.
Cleanse yourself.
Divest.
I asked to go.
I want to go.
Why?
I lost control.
I almost killed Luke.
He was trying to kill you.
You weren't there, Ryan.
I did a lot more than that.
I lost it.
I thought I was ready for this.
I thought... coming back would somehow help me.
A lot's happened in the past year--
Havenport...
Debra.
And, um, I've had some problems with my friends, my family.
I don't respond to normal situations... appropriately.
I can fake it most of the time.
Then I cloud over.
My dad won't talk to me.
He-- he doesn't get it.
Can you talk to somebody else?
I have.
I've talked to therapists,
I've talked to counselors.
I need to go, Ryan.
My flight's in the morning.
It's for the best.
For how long?
For 6 months or until this case is over, but I'm not going back to the Intel Division.
I'm so sorry, Max.
I didn't lose my career yet.
I got suspended.
- What if I call somebody at the Bureau?
- Don't, ok?
I knew the deal.
I'm ok with this.
What are you gonna do?
I'm more worried about what you're gonna do.
It's time to rethink this, what you've been doing, what we've all been doing.
I'm fine.
No.
You're obsessed, but go ahead and dodge the issue.
I'm not dodging anything, but I'm not gonna stop.
I can't.
Sure you can.
You make the decision right this moment.
You go back to teaching, you-- you forget about all of this.
I withdrew of the semester.
Look.
I'm not gonna lie to you, Max.
I can't, not after everything you've done for me, but I have to be the one to find him.
You mean to kill him.
Yeah.
I mean to kill him.
I stopped drinking so I could get clear-headed enough to find him, so I could get healthy enough to hunt him.
I started teaching because I knew it would anger him.
So this life you see, it's all for him.
So am I obsessed?
Yeah, I am, and I'm ok with it.
Maybe this new life was for Carroll, but it doesn't have to be anymore.
This is your life, Ryan, and it's very real.
You have a family-- me-- who loves you.
Just think about it, please.
Korban-- love, unity, peace.
We are one.
Korban is family,
Korban is love.
Korban forever.
You can call me Julia for now.
We have beds set up for you in the main dorm.
And what is your role here, Julia?
I assist Micah in all areas of operation,
I'm his wife and lead deacon.
Why do we have to wear these masks?
Because you haven't earned an identity yet.
I don't see much identity here.
I see conformity.
Emma.
What you see is unity.
You see community and spirit.
It's sad that you don't recognize that, Emma.
Micah wants to see Joe.
It appears Micah has requested your presence.
Robert will take you.
Don't fear me, girls.
I'm not your enemy, I'm your champion.
Come on.
I'll show you around.
Let's go.
What did I tell you, huh?
What did I tell you?
You told me not to drink in the car.
That's right, and look what you did.
You're gonna clean it up!
Ok.
I'll do it.
Aah!
I've had it with you.
Look what you did!
You are such a spoiled brat!
Come on!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
Ow!
That hurts!
Hey!
Is there a problem here?
This is family business.
Stay out of it!
Shut up!
NYPD!
Step away from the boy.
Step away!
- Police?
- Stay back.
Are you all right, son?
Smile, Miss Hardy.
Did I do good?
You did great, son.
Great.
Hello, Ryan.
I'm sorry it's come to this, but I don't know any other way to express what my loss feels like.
You take from me,
I take from you.
You wanted to see us?
Oh, yes.
Thank you, girls.
Beautiful work.
We'll continue tomorrow.
Blessed be the children.
I'm Micah.
It's nice to meet you.
Robert, you wait outside.
I want to do some private bonding with our new friend.
Ok.
You guys, too.
I'll scream if our guest gets all alpha on me.
Take off the mask.
Yep.
That's really you.
Damn.
It's good to meet you, Micah.
You may not sit at my table.
No.
No.
Of course not.
How presumptuous of me.
So, Joe Carroll, you're a dead man.
How'd you pull that off?
Oh, it's-- it's all in the details.
So you faked it.
As opposed to?
So cool what you did last year with your-- with your cult.
Mad props.
I was impressed the way you organized and gathered all your followers.
Dude, how did you get them to kill for you?
I've always had an innate ability to-- to connect with people.
So I'm guessing you're looking for a place to hide out,
Korban is your crib of choice.
I'm interested in more than just refuge.
What can you offer me, Joe?
You're, like, the world's most deadly killer.
Why would I welcome you into my kingdom?
$30,000 in a bag in my car.
Yep.
Got it.
Thank you for your donation.
What else?
I think, given the chance,
I could be of great help to both you and your cause.
How so?
You tell me.
Surely you must have something in mind.
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here.
Heh heh!
I could find some use for you, but the question is your commitment and can I trust you?
This is the Micah show here, and you need to be down with that, but are you?
I need your help, Micah.
I offer you my humble service in exchange for-- for your hospitality.
Ryan, I'm sorry about Max.
Anything?
Lily Gray's e-mail was tracked to a coffee shop just outside Boston.
Open wi-fi.
Whoever sent it didn't even have to get out of their car.
Any witnesses to Max's abduction?
It happened right outside her apartment.
Garage was already processed.
Security cameras were disabled.
No eye witnesses.
Ok.
We know the abductor was using an SUV, late seventies model, male on camera wearing a brown work jacket, flannel shirt.
All right, everybody.
Eyes up.
We're looking for two suspects.
We got camera footage from both corners near her apartment.
Hey.
I thought you left.
Mendez called me.
I'm here, Ryan.
Thank you.
Ryan, what time did she leave your place?
Uh, it was around 2:00.
She said she was heading home.
That puts her home near just after 2:30.
Let's go.
There!
Work jacket, flannel shirt.
What about the license plate?
It's been taped over.
That's the best I can do.
Well, put it through facial recognition.
Come on.
There's a person that could help us-
- Luke.
Lily sent this guy to punish me for Luke.
He would know who he is, where Lily is.
Luke would know.
Well, he's recovering because he was almost killed, and he's refusing to talk.
Let me try.
Max is not dead, or it would be on that tape, and it's not.
We are wasting time.
Please, Gina.
Hi.
Nice to meet you, Max.
Is that a tattoo?
Well, isn't that something?
Do you have any more?
Where-- where am I?
Look at this.
Heh heh.
It's a butterfly.
I've got lots of tattoos.
I really like this one.
It's pretty, right?
Come on.
Tell me.
Do you have any more tattoos?
_
Hey!
I came to see you, but first, they have to secure me.
They don't trust me.
Anger issues.
So... how you feeling?
Listen.
I'm sorry about Giselle, but she was trying to kill me.
I mean, you can't hold that against me.
I mean, what would you do in my situation, huh?
What do you want?
I need your help, Luke, and I know you have no reason to help me, but I really hope that you will.
I'm not gonna help you find my mother.
This is not about your mother.
She really liked you, you know?
Aw.
That's so nice to hear, but I need your help finding this guy.
Ooh.
Ooh, ooh.
You don't want find that guy.
He's bad news.
If you're looking for him, you must be in real trouble.
Why is that?
A little too gory for my mom's taste.
So your mom knows him?
My mom knows lots of people, Ryan.
She's been looking for the right guy for a really, really long time, and they're not all princes.
There's a lot of toads out there.
So... your mom was auditioning killers?
Ha!
No, no, no, no.
No, not killers, Ryan.
People.
She just wants to be loved like everybody else.
She just wants someone to understand her and accept her for who she is.
I mean, no one wants to be alone.
So where can I find this guy?
You already know him.
Everybody does.
What's his name?
Why do you need to know his--
I know what's happening.
Ha!
Mom got clever.
Tit for tat.
Oh.
This guy, he's hot for my mom.
He'll do anything for her.
What did he do?
Ooh!
Who is he?
His name's Kurt something or other.
I don't know his last name, but... you know him as The Huntsman.
The Huntsman is a known serial killer of women, all prostitutes.
He's believed to be in the Northeast Coast region of the country.
He's been evading Quantico for years-- no eye witnesses, no survivors.
Now the victim's time of death is roughly 24 hours after their abduction.
They're all killed with a high-velocity bow.
I see a lot of superficial cuts on their faces, arms, legs.
Yeah, we believe those were sustained while they ran for their lives through the woods.
He hunted them like prey.
He's a mission killer.
He's ridding the world of sin.
He hunts them, he guts them, he skins them.
We know what he looks like.
And we've got a first name.
Kurt.
Come on, guys.
We've only got 12 hours if he sticks to this MO.
I need those DMV records.
Max is not his typical victim.
He may be following different methods.
I have a match.
Kurt Bolen of Trenton, New Jersey.
That's him.
Let's go!
What is this?
The reckoning.
It's perfectly safe.
Right.
All community members have been through the reckoning many times.
This works better if you remain still.
Ok.
May I?
Of course.
I'm gonna ask you a series of questions.
These electrodes will measure your blood pressure, breathing rate, and body temp.
Oh.
So it's a glorified lie detector.
Mmm.
I should warn you that these machines tend not to work terribly well on people with my psychological profile.
You mean sociopaths?
Psychopaths?
Oh.
Who wants to be reduced to a label, hmm?
People of your ilk may respond differently, but they do respond.
A response that allows you to determine truthfulness?
I'm very good at this.
Oh.
Let me just get a level.
Your name is Joe Carroll?
Yes.
Did you like the view of my breasts when I leaned over?
No.
See?
It works.
Liar.
Shall we begin?
By all means.
Move in, move in!
Ohh!
Don't move!
Hands up!
Is Kurt Bolen your husband?
Where is he?
Where is he?
!
He w-went away for a few days.
Mom!
Come here.
We don't have time for this.
I know that this is difficult to accept, but we need your help.
No.
I told you.
He's traveling for work.
He sells office supplies.
We checked.
There's no business trip.
What?
No.
This is impossible.
Come on, Shannon.
Don't be that wife.
You know it's true.
Hey!
Shut up!
You don't know my dad.
Chris!
You don't know him.
Yeah.
Look at that camera angle.
Max is about 5'8".
That camera's shooting up at her from below.
You think whoever shot this was shorter than her.
By about a foot.
Hey.
You can't just come in here.
This is my room.
Where's your father, Chris?
What?
Where is your father?
Why are you asking me?
Because I think you shot that.
No, I didn't.
You see that girl?
That's my niece.
That's my family, and I'm not gonna let your sick, twisted father kill my niece.
Is she a whore?
Heh.
My dad hates whores.
He, uh, gives them what they deserve.
Mom, help!
Help!
Stop!
Ryan, Mike?
Open the door!
Stop!
Mom, help!
Open up!
I said open up!
Kurt has a cabin near Black River.
We have an address.
We need a search team at the following location.
Take that kid in for questioning.
Why do you murder?
I thought these machines only worked with yes or no questions.
Evasive.
I have a need that cannot be denied.
Have you reformed?
I don't believe I need to reform.
Have you murdered anyone in the last week?
Oh, yes.
Describe to me the feeling you get when you take a life.
It's... phew-- very hard to describe.
Is it sexual?
Very.
How so?
I'll have to show you sometime.
Why are you here?
What do you want?
I want to become part of Micah's flock.
Is that true?
Yes.
That's your only motive for being here?
Yes.
I wish to start anew, become something new.
I...
I want a new life.
We're done.
You can release him.
You gonna tell me how I did?
You know what the truth is, Joe.
How did you do?
Hmm.
Love, unity, peace.
We are one.
Korban is family, Korban is love.
And?
He's all truth, Micah.
Love, unity, peace.
We are one.
Korban is family.
Korban is love...
So where's your son?
He has school tomorrow.
I know who you are.
I would expect you to.
So how's this work, huh?
I'm not much of a hunt tied up.
I'm doing a favor for a friend, so we are going to skip the hunt and move immediately to the after party.
A friend?
Is her-- is her name Lily?
Ah.
Look at you, Miss Smarty Pants.
You-- you don't want to skip the hunt.
No more talking.
You could do her a favor, but don't be less than you are.
What do you mean?
Hunt... me.
Come on!
I'm a challenge!
You hunt hookers and drug addicts.
How hard is that?
I run a mile in under 6 minutes,
I'm a trained paramilitary officer.
Hunt me!
I am being paid to kill you here like this.
Yeah, but if you're as good as you claim, what difference does it make?
You're just gonna kill me anyway.
I could be a prize trophy to brag to your son about.
Hmm?
No deal.
All right, bitch.
You asked for it.
Check that door!
Are we too late?
No.
There's nothing on the camera.
There was a struggle.
Get the K-9 unit moving!
Move out, move out!
Sit here.
Please explain, Robert.
What exactly is this?
It's for you.
We're going to celebrate our new recruits.
You'll enjoy it.
It's fun.
Are we ok here?
Yes, very.
I think.
All right, man.
Find her, find her!
What is it?
This way.
He has the scent now.
This way.
Come on.
Mike.
Mike!
Max!
Thank God.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You ok?
Yeah.
I knew you'd come.
I knew you'd come.
Tonight, we rejoice, family.
We cleanse ourselves of sin.
With the blood of one, we may wash away the sins of many, and we will be one step closer to... going home.
♪ Ohh ♪
Let me, Micah!
Where's home?
Hell if I know.
Who among you is ready to make the sacrifice?
Choose me!
Choose me!
Through God's will, the choice will be made.
You.
Joe.
Joe!
Joe!
Bless you, child, for God has chosen you today!
The Lord has spoken!
His will must be done.
No, Micah, please!
We must trust each other.
No!
Joe!
Joe!
Joe!
No!
No.
No!
Joe!
Joe!
Joe!
Help me!
Ahh!
Joe!
Joe, what are they doing?
No!
No!
No!
For our sins!
Oh, my God!
No!
Micah!
Through her blood, we are saved.
No, no!
You wanted to see me?
Why did you do it?
I only did what I was compelled to do.
The Spirit spoke through me, Joe.
Emma is alive.
You'll see her soon.
No, no, no.
You targeted Emma on purpose to weaken me.
You've never used a little subterfuge in the name of truth?
I think it was a necessary introduction to our ways.
You're scared of me.
What happened?
I fail your little lie detector test, or did I pass it?
You're here because my husband wants you here, but don't think for a second I trust you.
Anything on Bolen's phone?
No.
Are you staying?
I'm leaving in the morning.
Hey.
- How's Max?
- She's good.
Lily just sent me a text.
It's another link to a video.
All right.
Let's get it up on the big screen.
Hey, Hopkins.
Hello, Ryan.
Is this live?
No.
It's time-stamped a few hours ago.
Where is she?
House, dining room, where?
I'm sorry about your niece.
She must be a terrible loss in your life.
She doesn't realize you saved her.
I have one more surprise.
You weren't the only one to hurt me, Ryan.
Another was involved, and he must pay for what he...
I know that place.
That's my dad's house.
...did to Luke.
She's in his living room.
Oh, my God.
Say hello to your son, Richard.
Go to hell.
All right.
Somebody, help.
344 Cherokee Lane,
Hampton, Virginia, now!
Such a hard man.
All right.
- Now!
- Go ahead, Mark.
Stop the video.
Stop it!
Mike, Mike.
No.
No.
No.
Get off me, get off me!
I have many more surprises for you, Ryan.
Get ready.
Mike.
Oh, Mike.
He's gone.
He's gone.
Oh, my God.
No, no, no, no.
_
I thought you were dead.
If something happened to you, that would end me.
Now you know how I feel.
So you have a plan?
I have an epic plan.
I need you, Em.
I want to make a trade... your son for Joe Carroll.
I sacrificed too much, Joe.
I'm not willing to give up on you.
Can't have you running off after Ryan Hardy.
Give me my son.
Now!
Where's Luke?
No!
It's too late!
Drive!
Mike, stop it!
What's going on with you?
I have Joe.
Where's the airstrip?
Tillman Road.
We'll meet you there in 20 minutes.
What?
Where is he?
I don't know!
Joe was here.
Someone inside the FBI is helping him.
You made me give up the FBI.
Please, Jana.
I'm here for you when you need anything.
You've been so good to me.
They killed my son.
You are getting exactly what you deserved.
Aah!
I'm done with you, Lily.
Good-bye.
We're here.
_
Should we call somebody, let them know we're here?
Oh.
They know we're here.
Creepy.
How well do you know this Robert guy?
He already told you that.
Am I talking to you?
Hey, hey, girls.
We're all tired.
Let's not fight?
Robert is an old friend, and he lives here with his friends.
So... what is the plan once we get inside?
Meet our host, figure out the hierarchy, feel our way, you know?
What kind of cult is this?
I hear they're quite a peaceful lot.
Roderick identified them as a vulnerable group, easily swayed.
And Robert has paved the way?
Yeah.
He seemed very enthusiastic.
Tell you the truth, I don't know Robert all that well.
He visited me a couple of times in prison, but he was very much Roderick's recruit.
Then ultimately, he never made it to Havenport, so we're kind of winging it here.
Somebody's coming.
Hey, Robert.
I'm sorry we're so late.
Sorry, Joe.
I wanted to bring you in a different way.
Hey.
Whoa!
All of you, on your knees!
I...
I'm sorry?
It's ok.
You can trust us.
Shut up, Robert.
If you want to enter, you must humble yourselves.
On your knees, hands behind your back now.
Ok.
Let's...
let's do as the nice people ask.
Joe Carroll.
So it really is you.
Oh, yes, it's me.
Are you in charge here?
Can I have a word...
Joe!
There's... there's really no need for that.
I know out in the world you're a big deal with a killer cult and a bunch of followers, but in here, you are the follower.
No!
Joe!
Go.
Get in the van!
Mr. Hardy, Mr. Hardy, Mr. Hardy!
Will you confirm your involvement in the search for Lily Gray?
Do you have anything to say?
People want to know what's going on.
Thanks for coming in, Mr. Hardy.
How's your wound?
I'll heal.
What can I do for you?
Well, I'm inclined to believe you.
About what?
That you saw Joe Carroll and that he is, in fact, alive and that he knew we were on to him.
Someone warned him not to get on that plane.
According to the pilot, he received a phone call just prior.
I went to the evidence warehouse in Virginia where Carroll's physical DNA was being stored, and it's possible that his DNA had been swapped.
That means that he would have someone inside the Bureau this entire time.
Any ideas on who that may be?
I need to know.
I cannot trust anyone.
Well, by your own logic, how can I trust you?
You're facing federal charges.
The only reason you're not in jail is because Director Franklin wanted to minimize the fallout.
However, there will be repercussions.
Gina, right?
Feel free to arrest me whenever you like, but till then...
You know, I actually like you.
I even respect your need to do this without the Bureau's help, but you put the people that you care about in danger, and I don't understand or respect that.
Mike, did you get my message?
They interview Luke yet?
He's not talking.
Everyone thinks Lily left the country.
DC found several different properties in various countries all linked to her.
Yeah, but she prepared for this.
Not gonna find her through the records.
Can you get me in to see Luke?
Maybe I can get him to talk.
No.
I'm leaving.
What?
I'm going home, Ryan.
I'm done.
Mike, wait.
Get out!
Move!
Joe, are you still there?
Still here, mouse.
It's gonna be fine.
Divest yourself of all your clothing and possessions and place them in a barrel.
What?
She wants us to take off our clothes.
No.
It's all good.
Go ahead.
It's time for you to lose what you learned outside these walls.
Shower.
Cleanse yourself.
Divest.
I asked to go.
I want to go.
Why?
I lost control.
I almost killed Luke.
He was trying to kill you.
You weren't there, Ryan.
I did a lot more than that.
I lost it.
I thought I was ready for this.
I thought... coming back would somehow help me.
A lot's happened in the past year...
Havenport...
Debra.
And, um, I've had some problems with my friends, my family.
I don't respond to normal situations... appropriately.
I can fake it most of the time.
Then I cloud over.
My dad won't talk to me.
He... he doesn't get it.
Can you talk to somebody else?
I have.
I've talked to therapists,
I've talked to counselors.
I need to go, Ryan.
My flight's in the morning.
It's for the best.
For how long?
For 6 months or until this case is over, but I'm not going back to the Intel Division.
I'm so sorry, Max.
I didn't lose my career yet.
I got suspended.
- What if I call somebody at the Bureau?
- Don't, ok?
I knew the deal.
I'm ok with this.
What are you gonna do?
I'm more worried about what you're gonna do.
It's time to rethink this, what you've been doing, what we've all been doing.
I'm fine.
No.
You're obsessed, but go ahead and dodge the issue.
I'm not dodging anything, but I'm not gonna stop.
I can't.
Sure you can.
You make the decision right this moment.
You go back to teaching, you... you forget about all of this.
I withdrew of the semester.
Look.
I'm not gonna lie to you, Max.
I can't, not after everything you've done for me, but I have to be the one to find him.
You mean to kill him.
Yeah.
I mean to kill him.
I stopped drinking so I could get clear-headed enough to find him, so I could get healthy enough to hunt him.
I started teaching because I knew it would anger him.
So this life you see, it's all for him.
So am I obsessed?
Yeah, I am, and I'm ok with it.
Maybe this new life was for Carroll, but it doesn't have to be anymore.
This is your life, Ryan, and it's very real.
You have a family... me... who loves you.
Just think about it, please.
Korban...
love, unity, peace.
We are one.
Korban is family, Korban is love.
Korban forever.
You can call me Julia for now.
We have beds set up for you in the main dorm.
And what is your role here, Julia?
I assist Micah in all areas of operation,
I'm his wife and lead deacon.
Why do we have to wear these masks?
Because you haven't earned an identity yet.
I don't see much identity here.
I see conformity.
Emma.
What you see is unity.
You see community and spirit.
It's sad that you don't recognize that, Emma.
Micah wants to see Joe.
It appears Micah has requested your presence.
Robert will take you.
Don't fear me, girls.
I'm not your enemy, I'm your champion.
Come on.
I'll show you around.
Let's go.
What did I tell you?
What did I tell you?
You told me not to drink in the car.
That's right, and look what you did.
You're gonna clean it up!
Ok.
I'll do it.
Aah!
I've had it with you.
Look what you did!
You are such a spoiled brat!
Come on!
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
That hurts!
Hey!
Is there a problem here?
This is family business.
Stay out of it!
Shut up!
NYPD!
Step away from the boy.
Step away!
- Police?
- Stay back.
Are you all right, son?
Smile, Miss Hardy.
Did I do good?
You did great, son.
Great.
Hello, Ryan.
I'm sorry it's come to this, but I don't know any other way to express what my loss feels like.
You take from me, I take from you.
You wanted to see us?
Oh, yes.
Thank you, girls.
Beautiful work.
We'll continue tomorrow.
Blessed be the children.
I'm Micah.
It's nice to meet you.
Robert, you wait outside.
I want to do some private bonding with our new friend.
Ok.
You guys, too.
I'll scream if our guest gets all alpha on me.
Take off the mask.
Yep.
That's really you.
Damn.
It's good to meet you, Micah.
You may not sit at my table.
No.
No.
Of course not.
How presumptuous of me.
So, Joe Carroll, you're a dead man.
How'd you pull that off?
Oh, it's... it's all in the details.
So you faked it.
As opposed to?
So cool what you did last year with your... with your cult.
Mad props.
I was impressed the way you organized and gathered all your followers.
Dude, how did you get them to kill for you?
I've always had an innate ability to... to connect with people.
So I'm guessing you're looking for a place to hide out,
Korban is your crib of choice.
I'm interested in more than just refuge.
What can you offer me, Joe?
You're, like, the world's most deadly killer.
Why would I welcome you into my kingdom?
$30,000 in a bag in my car.
Yep.
Got it.
Thank you for your donation.
What else?
I think, given the chance, I could be of great help to both you and your cause.
How so?
You tell me.
Surely you must have something in mind.
Otherwise, I wouldn't be here.
Heh heh!
I could find some use for you, but the question is your commitment and can I trust you?
This is the Micah show here, and you need to be down with that, but are you?
I need your help, Micah.
I offer you my humble service in exchange for... for your hospitality.
Ryan, I'm sorry about Max.
Anything?
Lily Gray's e-mail was tracked to a coffee shop just outside Boston.
Open wi-fi.
Whoever sent it didn't even have to get out of their car.
Any witnesses to Max's abduction?
It happened right outside her apartment.
Garage was already processed.
Security cameras were disabled.
No eye witnesses.
Ok.
We know the abductor was using an SUV, late seventies model, male on camera wearing a brown work jacket, flannel shirt.
All right, everybody.
Eyes up.
We're looking for two suspects.
We got camera footage from both corners near her apartment.
Hey.
I thought you left.
Mendez called me.
I'm here, Ryan.
Thank you.
Ryan, what time did she leave your place?
It was around 2:00.
She said she was heading home.
That puts her home near just after 2:30.
Let's go.
There!
Work jacket, flannel shirt.
What about the license plate?
It's been taped over.
That's the best I can do.
Well, put it through facial recognition.
Come on.
There's a person that could help us...
Luke.
Lily sent this guy to punish me for Luke.
He would know who he is, where Lily is.
Luke would know.
Well, he's recovering because he was almost killed, and he's refusing to talk.
Let me try.
Max is not dead, or it would be on that tape, and it's not.
We are wasting time.
Please, Gina.
Hi.
Nice to meet you, Max.
Is that a tattoo?
Well, isn't that something?
Do you have any more?
Where... where am I?
Look at this.
Heh heh.
It's a butterfly.
I've got lots of tattoos.
I really like this one.
It's pretty, right?
Come on.
Tell me.
Do you have any more tattoos?
_
Hey!
I came to see you, but first, they have to secure me.
They don't trust me.
Anger issues.
So... how you feeling?
Listen.
I'm sorry about Giselle, but she was trying to kill me.
I mean, you can't hold that against me.
I mean, what would you do in my situation?
What do you want?
I need your help, Luke, and I know you have no reason to help me, but I really hope that you will.
I'm not gonna help you find my mother.
This is not about your mother.
She really liked you, you know?
Aw.
That's so nice to hear, but I need your help finding this guy.
Ooh.
Ooh, ooh.
You don't want find that guy.
He's bad news.
If you're looking for him, you must be in real trouble.
Why is that?
A little too gory for my mom's taste.
So your mom knows him?
My mom knows lots of people, Ryan.
She's been looking for the right guy for a really, really long time, and they're not all princes.
There's a lot of toads out there.
So... your mom was auditioning killers?
Ha!
No, no, no, no.
No, not killers, Ryan.
People.
She just wants to be loved like everybody else.
She just wants someone to understand her and accept her for who she is.
I mean, no one wants to be alone.
So where can I find this guy?
You already know him.
Everybody does.
What's his name?
Why do you need to know his...
I know what's happening.
Ha!
Mom got clever.
Tit for tat.
Oh.
This guy, he's hot for my mom.
He'll do anything for her.
What did he do?
Ooh!
Who is he?
His name's Kurt something or other.
I don't know his last name, but... you know him as The Huntsman.
The Huntsman is a known serial killer of women, all prostitutes.
He's believed to be in the Northeast Coast region of the country.
He's been evading Quantico for years... no eye witnesses, no survivors.
Now the victim's time of death is roughly 24 hours after their abduction.
They're all killed with a high-velocity bow.
I see a lot of superficial cuts on their faces, arms, legs.
Yeah, we believe those were sustained while they ran for their lives through the woods.
He hunted them like prey.
He's a mission killer.
He's ridding the world of sin.
He hunts them, he guts them, he skins them.
We know what he looks like.
And we've got a first name.
Kurt.
Come on, guys.
We've only got 12 hours if he sticks to this MO.
I need those DMV records.
Max is not his typical victim.
He may be following different methods.
I have a match.
Kurt Bolen of Trenton, New Jersey.
That's him.
Let's go!
What is this?
The reckoning.
It's perfectly safe.
Right.
All community members have been through the reckoning many times.
This works better if you remain still.
Ok.
May I?
Of course.
I'm gonna ask you a series of questions.
These electrodes will measure your blood pressure, breathing rate, and body temp.
Oh.
So it's a glorified lie detector.
I should warn you that these machines tend not to work terribly well on people with my psychological profile.
You mean sociopaths?
Psychopaths?
Oh.
Who wants to be reduced to a label?
People of your ilk may respond differently, but they do respond.
A response that allows you to determine truthfulness?
I'm very good at this.
Oh.
Let me just get a level.
Your name is Joe Carroll?
Yes.
Did you like the view of my breasts when I leaned over?
No.
See?
It works.
Liar.
Shall we begin?
By all means.
Move in, move in!
Don't move!
Hands up!
Is Kurt Bolen your husband?
Where is he?
Where is he?
!
He w-went away for a few days.
Mom!
Come here.
We don't have time for this.
I know that this is difficult to accept, but we need your help.
No.
I told you.
He's traveling for work.
He sells office supplies.
We checked.
There's no business trip.
What?
No.
This is impossible.
Come on, Shannon.
Don't be that wife.
You know it's true.
Hey!
Shut up!
You don't know my dad.
Chris!
You don't know him.
Yeah.
Look at that camera angle.
Max is about 5'8".
That camera's shooting up at her from below.
You think whoever shot this was shorter than her.
By about a foot.
Hey.
You can't just come in here.
This is my room.
Where's your father, Chris?
What?
Where is your father?
Why are you asking me?
Because I think you shot that.
No, I didn't.
You see that girl?
That's my niece.
That's my family, and I'm not gonna let your sick, twisted father kill my niece.
Is she a whore?
Heh.
My dad hates whores.
He, gives them what they deserve.
Mom, help!
Help!
Stop!
Ryan, Mike?
Open the door!
Stop!
Mom, help!
Open up!
I said open up!
Kurt has a cabin near Black River.
We have an address.
We need a search team at the following location.
Take that kid in for questioning.
Why do you murder?
I thought these machines only worked with yes or no questions.
Evasive.
I have a need that cannot be denied.
Have you reformed?
I don't believe I need to reform.
Have you murdered anyone in the last week?
Oh, yes.
Describe to me the feeling you get when you take a life.
It's... very hard to describe.
Is it sexual?
Very.
How so?
I'll have to show you sometime.
Why are you here?
What do you want?
I want to become part of Micah's flock.
Is that true?
Yes.
That's your only motive for being here?
Yes.
I wish to start anew, become something new.
I...
I want a new life.
We're done.
You can release him.
You gonna tell me how I did?
You know what the truth is, Joe.
How did you do?
Love, unity, peace.
We are one.
Korban is family, Korban is love.
And?
He's all truth, Micah.
Love, unity, peace.
We are one.
Korban is family.
Korban is love...
So where's your son?
He has school tomorrow.
I know who you are.
I would expect you to.
So how's this work?
I'm not much of a hunt tied up.
I'm doing a favor for a friend, so we are going to skip the hunt and move immediately to the after party.
A friend?
Is her...
is her name Lily?
Look at you, Miss Smarty Pants.
You... you don't want to skip the hunt.
No more talking.
You could do her a favor, but don't be less than you are.
What do you mean?
Hunt... me.
Come on!
I'm a challenge!
You hunt hookers and drug addicts.
How hard is that?
I run a mile in under 6 minutes,
I'm a trained paramilitary officer.
Hunt me!
I am being paid to kill you here like this.
Yeah, but if you're as good as you claim, what difference does it make?
You're just gonna kill me anyway.
I could be a prize trophy to brag to your son about.
No deal.
All right, bitch.
You asked for it.
Check that door!
Are we too late?
No.
There's nothing on the camera.
There was a struggle.
Get the K-9 unit moving!
Move out, move out!
Sit here.
Please explain, Robert.
What exactly is this?
It's for you.
We're going to celebrate our new recruits.
You'll enjoy it.
It's fun.
Are we ok here?
Yes, very.
I think.
All right, man.
Find her, find her!
What is it?
This way.
He has the scent now.
This way.
Come on.
Mike.
Mike!
Max!
Thank God.
Hey.
- Hey.
- Hey.
You ok?
Yeah.
I knew you'd come.
I knew you'd come.
Tonight, we rejoice, family.
We cleanse ourselves of sin.
With the blood of one, we may wash away the sins of many, and we will be one step closer to... going home.
Let me, Micah!
Where's home?
Hell if I know.
Who among you is ready to make the sacrifice?
Choose me!
Choose me!
Through God's will, the choice will be made.
You.
Joe.
Joe!
Joe!
Bless you, child, for God has chosen you today!
The Lord has spoken!
His will must be done.
No, Micah, please!
We must trust each other.
No!
Joe!
Joe!
Joe!
No!
No.
No!
Joe!
Joe!
Joe!
Help me!
Joe!
Joe, what are they doing?
No!
No!
No!
For our sins!
Oh, my God!
No!
Micah!
Through her blood, we are saved.
No, no!
You wanted to see me?
Why did you do it?
I only did what I was compelled to do.
The Spirit spoke through me, Joe.
Emma is alive.
You'll see her soon.
No, no, no.
You targeted Emma on purpose to weaken me.
You've never used a little subterfuge in the name of truth?
I think it was a necessary introduction to our ways.
You're scared of me.
What happened?
I fail your little lie detector test, or did I pass it?
You're here because my husband wants you here, but don't think for a second I trust you.
Anything on Bolen's phone?
No.
Are you staying?
I'm leaving in the morning.
Hey.
- How's Max?
- She's good.
Lily just sent me a text.
It's another link to a video.
All right.
Let's get it up on the big screen.
Hey, Hopkins.
Hello, Ryan.
Is this live?
No.
It's time-stamped a few hours ago.
Where is she?
House, dining room, where?
I'm sorry about your niece.
She must be a terrible loss in your life.
She doesn't realize you saved her.
I have one more surprise.
You weren't the only one to hurt me, Ryan.
Another was involved, and he must pay for what he...
I know that place.
That's my dad's house.
...did to Luke.
She's in his living room.
Oh, my God.
Say hello to your son, Richard.
Go to hell.
All right.
Somebody, help.
344 Cherokee Lane,
Hampton, Virginia, now!
Such a hard man.
All right.
- Now!
- Go ahead, Mark.
Stop the video.
Stop it!
Mike, Mike.
No.
No.
No.
Get off me, get off me!
I have many more surprises for you, Ryan.
Get ready.
Mike.
Oh, Mike.
He's gone.
He's gone.
Oh, my God.
No, no, no, no.
Help!
Somebody help me!
Somebody help me!
Help me!
Help me!
Help me, please, you have to help me!
Please!
Hey, what's that place with great turkey panini?
Mancolo's.
No, no the--
Oh, um, Castellani's.
Mm.
Order lunch from there for the department budget meeting.
Love that panini.
♪ The Librarians 01x03 ♪ And the Horns of a Dilemma Original Air Date on December 14, 2014
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
Go, go.
Oomph.
It took me two minutes to disable all three of you.
Stone, you've got an IQ of 190.
You should know you can't solve everything with brute force alone.
It's worked so far.
Fight smarter, not harder.
Still, at least you can fight.
Ezekiel bailed on his team.
These are the hands of a world-class thief.
I don't do punchy.
And Cassandra hid.
Badly.
I'm here to do science and math.
And occasionally hallucinate.
You're just not being fair.
You think I'm not fair, wait until you meet the bad guys, which is why we'll run drills again tomorrow and every day until I'm sure I can take you out into the field with even a chance of you coming back in one piece.
How substandard were they?
Good pep talk, Jenkins.
While you were out, a new page appeared in the clipping book.
Looks fascinating.
No.
Not yet.
Well, this is crazy.
Every day a new page shows up of weird newspaper clippings in this book.
And every day you tell us to ignore it.
We've hardly opened it since the day Flynn left.
Because you're not ready.
Flynn told us we were supposed to help people.
Ezekiel's right.
Flynn gave us a job.
We're supposed to be checking out the weird-- not sit around here.
Ezekiel's right.
I said that.
Jenkins, stay out--
Marvelous, isn't it?
I told you, this is where I do my research.
Judson always insisted we just lock the artifacts away but I experiment on them, study them.
Improve them.
It's hard enough to rein them in without you dangling that clippings book in front of them.
Why rein them?
You'll have to put them in the field sooner or later.
I've gone into the field with experienced soldiers with a good plan, good Intel and still come home with nothing but dog tags.
I'm talking soldiers with training who've seen combat.
These three?
I promised Flynn I'd keep them alive.
They're not even close to ready.
We're doing this, right?
Hell yeah, we are.
Let's go.
I appreciate you wanting to keep them out of harm's way.
But librarians exist to keep magic out of the wrong hands.
Their job is to be in harm's way.
I can't protect three of them at once and they can't take care of themselves.
Not without a lot more training.
We used to put librarians in the field with no training at all.
Oh, yeah?
And how many came back?
The best ones.
I said--
Henry Birch.
Twenty-one.
He was on a full-scholarship in chemical engineering at Boston University.
He went missing two days ago.
Seven other clippings, all missing people, disappeared this year.
That many, the police are on it.
Nope.
Victims are from all around the country.
The only reason to suspect they're connected is that they all showed up in our magic book.
That's eight people gone.
Maybe dead.
We don't have any-- you know?
How many more are gonna go missing before we step in?
What if he's still alive?
What if we have a chance to save Henry Birch and we don't?
And you're willing to risk your lives for him?
I won't risk my life.
But I assume I can outrun anything, so I'm in.
Fine, but we're going in with a plan.
I want full breakdowns on the missing, backgrounds on their workplaces, magical and supernatural possibilities.
Oh, God, what have I done?
Even though the victims were from all over, they all disappeared in Boston.
Any connection beyond the city?
Yes.
Golden Axe Foods.
They all worked and this was tricky, some of them under subsidiaries, some under shell companies,
Henry Birch was for a scholarship, but...
In conclusion, they were all interns at Golden Axe Foods.
I'm familiar with the logo.
They were all over the farms in my home town.
They sell, like, engineered seeds and stuff, it's huge.
I've scoped the security.
Run of the mill guards, boring alarms, when do we break in?
We don't break in, we go in, we ask questions, no picking fights--
What are you doing?
Sending you to Boston.
I present to you the back door.
Yeah, that's the broom closet.
Ah, no!
It is a door behind which presently exists the broom closet.
Mr. Stone, hook those up.
Put 'em here.
You see, magic works on similarities.
Uh, symbolic resonance.
Yes.
A voodoo doll is symbolic of a person.
And lead can be transformed into gold because it is already similar.
So, with a little magic and I might add a great deal of underappreciated work, that broom closet door can become a symbolic representation of any other door.
Oh!
That first step might be just a little--
Yeah, thanks for the warning, Jenkins.
This is Boston.
You moved the annex to Boston?
No, just the door.
Does no one listen?
It's an Einstein-Rosen bridge.
It's a wormhole.
The back door is on the East Coast--
and the front door is still on the West Coast.
Wait, we can go anywhere we want in the world?
Absolutely anywhere, that has a door.
Still working out the kinks.
You know, it doesn't stay open very long.
And it's not the most accurate thing.
And most frankly, getting to the right city is a win--
Any door?
Like, say, a bank vault door?
I'm asking for a mate.
We do this, you do what I say, when I say.
Clear?
Good luck.
What?
Nothing.
Go away.
I'm working.
Eight of our interns have gone missing.
Golden Axe Foods is one of the oldest companies in the world.
Over the decades, the centuries, no matter war, famine, plague, Golden Axe always prevails and we've done so through integrity.
So the idea of any wrongdoing is--
Well, I for one am shocked.
Franklin, did you know about this?
I'm also shocked.
And your interest in this, miss?
Colonel Baird, NATO counter-terrorism.
I am less shocked.
You think our interns were terrorists?
You're a big agribusiness.
You have access to the food supply.
We prefer not to take any chances.
Miss Willis?
The Tokyo office is on the line.
Not now, Jennie.
Well, as CEO of Golden Axe, I am, of course, deeply concerned about this chain of events.
But I don't know how much more I can tell you.
We throughput interns pretty quickly here.
Most don't have the skills to compete.
You can imagine what it's like to deal with utter amateurs.
You know, why don't you speak to human resources?
I'm sure they have the records of the people you're looking for.
Would you show them the way?
Mr. Franklin, Tokyo really needs to confirm the shipping price.
Hai.
They know something.
How do you know they know something?
Eight missing interns, they should've buried us in lawyers, not danced us straight in to meet Karen Willis, the CEO.
She wanted to size us up.
Find out what we know.
So they know now that we know something but do we now know they know something more than just knowing we know something?
I betcha whatever they're about to show us in HR is gonna be faked up.
You know, just for show.
The originals might be on the main server, if I can find the server room.
We just passed it.
Back there.
Yeah, air seals for climate control.
Most security I've seen on this floor.
Good, you three go to HR.
If she wants to put on a show, you're the audience.
I'm gonna break into the server room.
Uh, Ezekiel Jones, world-class thief.
Why am I playing audience and you're a burglar?
Because I want the three of you together, safe, in a place that is very boring.
What I say, when I say it.
Excuse me?
Restroom?
Down the hall.
Go ahead.
I'll catch up.
Please.
I'll wait for your friend.
Room zero-fourteen.
Go left, left, then right.
We should have warned Baird that guy was going back after her.
Hey, she's the one who sent us on a snipe hunt.
Let her sweat a little.
What did he say?
Left, left and right?
You are not servers.
Look at this.
Looks like Greek frescoes.
This is late Helladic, I think.
Now why would these be down here in the basement?
More like, sub-basement.
Did we down a little and nobody noticed?
Guys, can we just hurry up and find Human Resources?
This lighting is giving me a headache.
Are you sure it's not your brain grape about to pop?
Okay, new rule.
How about we not refer to the tumor that will one day kill me as a brain grape?
Ah, here we go.
And I was worried we were getting lost.
We're not in Human Resources.
Go, go.
Baird!
I'm texting you some pictures.
I found something real weird.
Wow, did you?
We found something weird too!
I found a room full of really old art.
That is weird.
We found a room full of human skulls!
What do you mean human skulls?
How many ways can I mean human skulls?
Left, to left and right, guys.
This doesn't make any sense.
Wait a minute, this is not late Helladic.
This is Minoan.
There's barely any complete Minoan art known to exist.
Minoan.
Why do I know that name?
Greek mythology.
Theseus and the Minotaur.
Big monster, head of a bull.
Inescapable Labyrinth.
Theseus had a big ball of thread, used it so he wouldn't get lost--
This place is kind of Labyrinth-y.
And I'm looking at a really old ball of thread.
Well, that's clearly stupid.
There is no way under a skyscraper we are in a Labyrinth.
Okay, maybe we are in a Labyrinth.
Let's go!
Yes.
Jenkins, quick question.
Any chance someone could have recreated the Minotaur's Labyrinth in a skyscraper in Boston?
Goodness, no.
don't be absurd.
Even assuming that you had enough power, you would need a, just a magnificent collection of ancient Minoan artifacts to focus it.
The librarians are in the Labyrinth.
I sent them there alone.
Why?
To keep them safe.
That was a very bad idea.
Although I will say I'm impressed.
We've had guardians lose librarians in the past of course.
But never three in one day.
It'll be quite some time before anyone beats that.
So how do we get them out?
We don't.
It's a Labyrinth.
The whole point is you can't get out.
Well, what about your magic back door?
Can't you open that inside the Labyrinth?
Colonel, I told you, I was lucky we found Boston.
I, I can't pinpoint them in a maze.
Okay, so what about that other thing you said, symbolic whose-ee-flopper, whatchamacallit, thingamajiggy?
The Labyrinth isn't just a maze, it's a magic maze.
All right?
It exists in more than three dimensions and you know what I seriously doubt?
Putting an extra-dimensional hole in a multi-dimensional space is a very good idea!
That was not a request.
Guys, wait.
Something isn't--
Hm, just give me a minute.
Wasn't it right, then right, then left?
No, no, no, no, no.
This is not the time, kid.
Okay?
We got to run because--
Do not say because the Minotaur is coming.
Because there is no Minotaur and I'll tell you why.
In your myth, what's-his-face?
Theseus.
Yeah, right.
He killed the Minotaur.
So the Minotaur is dead, and if it's dead, he's not here.
Right?
Right?
This is wrong.
The hallway we were in before should cut through here, but it doesn't.
It's impossible.
Hey, guys, I think we should go this way.
This is great.
Stuck in a magic maze with two of the least reliable people I know.
Wait, least reliable?
You have been on my case non-stop.
Why am I "unreliable"?
Not now, all right?
We got to move.
I know.
I betrayed you that first time, so--
Not now.
Hey.
I was scared.
I have a death sentence inside my head and they offered me a cure, so what was I supposed to do?
Not sell us out.
So self-righteous.
Look at me and all I've sacrificed;
I'm such a good boy.
Well, I take my responsibility seriously--
Shh.
You made your bed.
I didn't get a choice in mine.
So you don't get to judge me for a--
There's a pattern.
Pattern, pattern.
Pattern, pattern.
Circles inside squares inside triangles.
That's why I have the headache.
My brain knew that we were in a maze before we even really noticed it ourselves.
I can see it.
Kind of.
Can you kind of get us out of here?
Oy!
Whatever issues you two are having, save it.
I saw we follow the brain grape.
We are not calling it a brain grape.
Follow the brain grape.
This way.
Ha!
Where next?
Kind of more guessing than knowing, but I guess this way.
One short, one long, two short.
What?
Morse code?
That's an L. For librarians?
It's Baird.
Let's go.
Anyone else worried the monster heard those gunshots, too?
I'm hoping we find Baird first.
Human Resources.
So safe.
So boring.
Go!
We have to hold out as long as we can!
Well, I'll be damned.
I did not think that would work with a cabinet door.
Go, go!
Symbolic representation of you in the Labyrinth.
That's a trick I won't be trying any time soon again.
Ha.
So.
First time out.
How'd it go?
As far as we can tell, ma'am, she doesn't see to have disturbed anything.
Why was she in here?
She can't know what we're doing unless-- no.
There's only one librarian and he was just spotted in--?
Budapest, I think.
Expedite the timetable just in case.
Start tomorrow, with that blonde idiot at my desk.
Honestly, how hard is it to knock?
And if these people come back?
They won't.
Nobody escapes the Labyrinth.
It's the thread.
The thread.
What's all this other stuff?
Magic has three parts.
Power, to change reality.
Focus to direct that change and an effect that change in the real world.
The effect would be the Labyrinth, right?
Created by the focus of the Minoan artifacts.
Mr. Stone, you have a knack for this.
But the power that holds it all together, that's the original thread in the myth.
Millennia old.
"Millennia" means thousands of years--
Yes, thank you.
Once you take the thread out, it would be like taking the battery out of a car.
Yes.
Crude analogy but totally accurate.
We destroy the thread and the entire multi-dimensional hoo-ha collapses in on itself with a whoosh.
All we have to do is get past that Minotaur.
Everything I have on Minotaurs.
Nasty creatures.
Hold a grudge.
I put seven rounds into the thing and it still got back up.
There are many immortal beings that can be injured but not killed.
Nicolas Flamel.
The Wandering Jew.
The Black Mask, the sources reported him killed many times but he always seems to pop up when needed.
If I can't kill this thing, what am I supposed to do?
Colonel, the library chose you for a reason and trust me, it wasn't because of your ability to kill.
We're not gonna save Henry Birch.
Well, then we get him justice.
We're here to protect innocent people from out-of-control magic.
I say this qualifies.
Golden Axe Foods has the Labyrinth in its basement.
Tell me why.
Well the myth is that the King imprisoned the Minotaur in the Labyrinth.
Every seven years he sends down 14 virgins, seven men, seven women, for sacrifice.
Good luck finding 14 virgins these days.
The Greek words for "virgin" are eitheos and parthenos, they both literally mean unmarried man and woman.
You-- it could mean youth, it could mean inexperienced--
Interns.
Okay?
So in the myth, what did the King get for his sacrifices?
He gets power.
He gets prosperity and wealth.
"Through war, famine and plague, Golden Axe will always prevail".
The myth calls for fourteen sacrifices.
They're gonna kill six more people if we don't do anything about it.
Six more people are gonna be screaming, run down by that.
At least.
I mean, this has been going on for centuries, who's to say they're ever going to stop?
We have to get that thread.
Have I mentioned, you know, world class thief?
Relentlessly.
So the cases themselves have some heavy-duty security.
Taser nets are built in.
Touch one of the cases without deactivating the net and zap, 50,000 volts.
But the trick is getting back into that building, past that monster and tunneling underground is obviously out of the question--
Guys?
That's impossible.
This is exactly like the frescoes that were in the--
We're back in the Labyrinth.
Okay, so I've got a phone signal, but no GPS.
How is this happening?
Sorry, could you tell me where the nearest subway is?
Sure.
Thanks.
Yes?
Jenkins, quick question.
We're on the street outside the annex but we seem to be back in the Labyrinth.
Huh.
So, annoying or cryptic, those are your two speeds, huh?
It's possible the Labyrinth isn't just a place, it is a lingering effect.
Like a curse?
Yes.
The Labyrinth won't let you out.
It's confusing your senses, warping space around you.
It doesn't matter where you go, you'll get lost, eventually wandering back into its clutches.
Fascinating.
So how do we find the thread and shut down the maze if we're stuck in the maze?
Huh.
If you say "huh" one more time, so help me--
Colonel Baird!
Colonel Baird?
Run!
Jenkins!
The Minotaur's in the maze with us!
Get us out of here!
I told you, I cannot pull that trick off twice.
Um...
But perhaps I could use the Labyrinth itself to buy you some time.
He's right behind us!
The Labyrinth confuses the senses, distorts space.
I can actually amplify the effect.
If I create a dimensional bubble around you so confusing even the Minotaur can't find you.
For how long?
Five minutes.
Maybe less, certainly not more.
Good luck, Colonel.
Oh, and run.
Come on.
Okay, stay calm.
I've been in worse spots than this before.
Well, that strains credibility.
Stone, you take point.
Ezekiel, watch the rear, there's a high roof up there.
There isn't.
You heard what Jenkins said, the Labyrinth is just trying to confuse us.
Even it was there, we couldn't reach it.
It's not a suggestion, it's an order.
And I'm not a soldier!
You're right.
I am, but you're not.
You're librarians.
Librarians win because of what they know.
So, what do you know?
Come on, guys, what do you know?
Theseus.
Bloke from the story.
He went into the maze and killed the Minotaur.
The Minotaur can't be killed.
Then how did he escape?
You said the Minotaur was imprisoned inside the Labyrinth.
Every prison I've ever seen had a control center inside the walls.
Your man Theseus, maybe he didn't go to the center to try and kill the Minotaur--
Maybe he went to the center to pull the plug on the maze, same as us.
You want to bet that maze leads back to those artifacts?
No, because I was in that artifact room, I wasn't-- keycard.
I used that stolen keycard.
The executive keycards keep them from getting lost in the Labyrinth.
We don't try to escape.
We go deeper in.
I can get us to the center.
My brain started trying to figure out the maze when I was in it before.
I've seen, experienced more of it now.
I bet I can get us through.
Okay, Cassandra's our thread.
Follow her.
Outrun the Minotaur, steal the power source for the maze, shut it down.
Librarians, we have a plan.
The Labyrinth:
Imagine a building where every floor has a different layout.
And sometimes, when you walk around, you move between floors without even knowing it.
So from your perspective, the layout looks different but if you know what floor you're on, it makes perfect sense.
Sure.
Duh.
I just need to know how many floors are in the building.
That number, all the core geometry is gonna be based on that.
- Without it--
- It should be seven.
Seven's the number.
The myth is built on seven.
Seven male victims.
Seven female, sacrificed every seven years.
Seven.
Seven is violet.
Three seven-dimensional polytypes:
Seven simplex, seven-cube and the seven-orthoplex.
There aren't enough vertices.
It's a demihepteract!
Gotcha!
Okay.
Is this the way in?
It's the way back to the annex.
Probably.
Maybe.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Where are you going?
We have to split up.
And you don't want to be in the Labyrinth when it goes poof.
We're staying together.
I'm not letting you out of my sight again.
If we stick together he's got us.
This doesn't work unless someone distracts Mister Stompy.
Fine, I'll distract him.
On your own, you don't stand a chance.
And if he kills you, then he's gonna chase us down.
So we send these two in alone?
Cassandra to find the center, me to grab the thread.
It's the only way.
You can't protect us all.
How much time do you need?
Ten minutes to find the center.
Five to crack the case holding the thread.
15 minutes.
Check.
Don't jump the gun.
Don't lose the bull.
And don't stray off the path.
Good hunting.
Remember, we do this--
I know-- smarter, not harder.
I got it.
Minotaur growls )
Yo!
Come on, boy.
Okay, which way to the center?
That way.
No, wait.
That way.
You sure?
Back off, I'm doing math.
That way.
He's gaining on us.
Seven times seven is forty-nine.
Forty-nine times seven is three-forty-three.
Wait.
It's here.
It's right here.
Good for math.
This way!
We're not gonna make it.
What are you doing?
I'll buy you as much time as I can.
- What?
- Go!
No!
Baird!
--Seven points on a heptagon-- seven is a Mersenne prime, two to the third minus one equals seven---
I--
I can't do it.
No, I can't do it.
Seven dimensions is-- it's too much.
I can't.
Seven's nothing.
Leaves you with what, three fingers?
I once stole a gun out of a cop's hand using three fingers.
Stone was right.
You can't trust me.
I'll let everyone down.
If I was in your shoes, with that thing growing in my head,
I'd have sold everybody out for a cure, too.
The only difference is, I would have stuck the landing.
Let Flynn die.
Let the serpent brotherhood win.
Let the world burn.
But you didn't.
Yeah, you screwed people over but you didn't let them down.
I can't hold it though, it's too much.
So close your eyes.
Focus on your other senses.
My other senses and I don't get along so well.
Brain grape.
So I'll be your other senses.
Shut your eyes and see the map inside your head.
I'll lead you through.
You really trust me to do that?
I'm the thief that bails on everybody.
Pretty sure you're the one trusting me.
Okay.
We need to go down and to the left.
That's good.
Good.
Good.
Look at that.
Smarter and harder.
You did it.
We made it.
You okay?
Yeah.
Go.
I just need to count down from seven.
Seven is violet, six is indigo, five is blue--
Shut down the tasers, pop the case, grab the thread.
Five minutes is all we need.
You don't have it.
Who are you?
We're the librarians.
We accept your surrender.
There's only one librarian and you are not him.
But something has changed.
There's more magic in the world, more power to our sacrifices.
Golden Axe, in one form or another has been sacrificing innocents to the Labyrinth for 3,000 years and we have never seen a stock bump like we got off our last offering.
We made it.
Is it still behind us?
Assume yes.
You are the first modern people to reach the center.
No intern has ever managed that.
Kids today.
There's no initiative!
You are a more old-fashioned, ritual sacrifice kind of person?
I single-handedly modernized the process.
I said, "let's amortize".
Spread the sacrifices out over the year instead of doing them all at once.
Increases the overhead but the decrease in visibility means your return on investment is even higher on a per-intern basis.
Hey.
You got to spend money to make money.
I get it.
Let's say we all part as friends--
You know, I'm not sure if shooting you here counts towards our fourteen or if the Minotaur has to make the kill itself.
I guess I'll find out tomorrow when I see the market returns.
Oh!
Oh!
Only two of you?
I never thought they were cut out for--
Is that thing trying to get into my annex?
You led that back to my--?
Not now!
Hey!
This is delicate.
That's good, too.
Come on, then.
Give me that thread.
If you drop it, we're all doomed.
Uh, any ideas?
Hey, let's be professional.
I have the resources.
You obviously have the talent.
Name your price.
Double if you take it in stock options.
Jenkins.
He said that magic depends on symbols.
What better symbol of a Labyrinth than a straight line rapped around and around and around itself?
Here.
Catch!
The Labyrinth!
The Labyrinth!
I believe I said with a "whoosh".
Cassandra, Jones!
Whoa!
Got it.
Ha ha!
Whoa!
We made it.
Yeah.
You did.
This time, you did.
You should have seen her.
No hiding.
Took the fight right to the big bad.
And Ezekiel.
He did kind of save the day by bailing on me.
I told you.
I don't do punchy.
Well done.
May I?
Now without this to serve as a power source, the Labyrinth should shrivel up and wink out of existence.
Eventually.
We ought to lock that up.
Yes.
Well, we don't have the facilities of the main library, but I'll think of something.
What about Willis?
I mean, I know we stopped her, but shouldn't she go to jail or something for what she did to Henry Birch and the others?
I wouldn't worry about Ms. Willis.
She imprisoned a Minotaur.
Nasty creatures.
Hold a grudge.
Those people do not know who they're messing with.
Librarians or not, we will find them, destroy them and get back what we--
Hey.
Look, um, things got a little heated in there--
Don't worry about it.
I'm not.
Kind of worried about what you said to me.
You know, if we're gonna work together, you're gonna need to trust--
Nobody knows.
Nobody back home knows about this.
I have kept it a secret for twenty years.
Why would you hide that?
You're a genius, you know about culture and art and beautiful things.
I told you before, family ain't ever easy.
For me...
You don't-- No.
That's enough for now.
The point is, I'm used to keeping my life separated.
All right?
My family, my friends, I love 'em.
I like 'em.
No problem working right along side of them.
Any of them.
But I don't trust a single one of 'em to tell them...
I mean, can you imagine meeting Flynn, meeting you, meeting Baird and the thief.
Finding out about this library.
Finding people I could trust.
Well, you know how that felt?
I do.
I really do.
And then to have it broken?
I like you, Cassie.
There's no way around it, I just do.
But I trusted you and, uh, I learned my lesson.
Not, it's not-- look, it always ends bad so--
old way's best.
So, end of day, not too bad for a first time out, was it?
You did okay.
I, I could do better.
I spent my entire adult life in the military.
Everybody fits into a box.
You don't.
You're not assets to be protected, you're not soldiers I can order around.
I don't know what you are.
Well, maybe the term you're looking for is "partners".
Fair enough.
Can you go back to the part where you said we were awesome?
I said you did okay.
Yeah, but I'm gonna take that as "we rule."
Mostly me.
You guys were okay.
Okay?
I did math.
True.
Points for math.
Stone, though, you mostly just got beat up.
I do rule.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man
( lights buzzing )
( creature roars )
Help!
Somebody help me!
( roaring )
Somebody help me!
Help me!
- Help me!
- ( creature roars )
Help me, please, you have to help me!
Please!
( speaking in ancient greek )
( screaming )
Hey, what's that place with great turkey panini?
Mancolo's.
No, no the--
Oh, um, castellani's.
Mm.
Order lunch from there for the department budget meeting.
Love that panini.
Go, go.
( grunts )
( grunts )
Oomph.
( sighs )
It took me two minutes to disable all three of you.
Stone, you've got an iq of 190.
You should know you can't solve everything with brute force alone.
It's worked so far.
Fight smarter, not harder.
Still, at least you can fight.
Ezekiel bailed on his team.
These are the hands of a world-class thief.
I don't do punchy.
And cassandra hid.
Badly.
I'm here to do science and math.
And occasionally hallucinate.
You're just not being fair.
You think i'm not fair, wait until you meet
The bad guys, which is why we'll run drills again tomorrow
And every day until i'm sure i can take you out
Into the field with even a chance of you coming back in one piece.
How substandard were they?
Good pep talk, jenkins.
While you were out, a new page appeared in the clipping book.
Looks fascinating.
No.
Not yet.
Well, this is crazy.
Every day a new page shows up
Of weird newspaper clippings in this book.
And every day you tell us to ignore it.
We've hardly opened it since the day flynn left.
Because you're not ready.
Flynn told us we were supposed to help people.
Ezekiel's right.
Flynn gave us a job.
We're supposed to be checking out the weird--
Not sit around here.
Ezekiel's right.
I said that.
Jenkins, stay out--
Marvelous, isn't it?
I told you, this is where i do my research.
Judson always insisted we just lock the artifacts away
But i experiment on them, study them.
Improve them.
( electricity buzz )
( chuckles )
It's hard enough to rein them in without you dangling
That clippings book in front of them.
Why rein them?
You'll have to put them in the field sooner or later.
I've gone into the field with experienced soldiers
With a good plan, good intel and still come home
With nothing but dog tags.
I'm talking soldiers with training who've seen combat.
These three?
I promised flynn i'd keep them alive.
They're not even close to ready.
We're doing this, right?
Hell yeah, we are.
Let's go.
I appreciate you wanting to keep them out of harm's way.
But librarians exist to keep magic out of the wrong hands.
Their job is to be in harm's way.
I can't protect three of them at once
And they can't take care of themselves.
Not without a lot more training.
We used to put librarians in the field with no training at all.
Oh, yeah?
And how many came back?
The best ones.
I said--
Henry birch.
Twenty-one.
He was on a full-scholarship in chemical engineering at boston university.
He went missing two days ago.
Seven other clippings, all missing people, disappeared this year.
That many, the police are on it.
Nope.
Victims are from all around the country.
The only reason to suspect they're connected
Is that they all showed up in our magic book.
That's eight people gone.
Maybe dead.
We don't have any-- you know?
How many more are gonna go missing before we step in?
What if he's still alive?
What if we have a chance to save henry birch and we don't?
And you're willing to risk your lives for him?
I won't risk my life.
But i assume i can outrun anything, so i'm in.
( inhales deeply, exhales )
Fine, but we're going in with a plan.
I want full breakdowns on the missing,
Backgrounds on their workplaces,
Magical and supernatural possibilities.
Oh, god, what have i done?
Even though the victims were from all over,
They all disappeared in boston.
Any connection beyond the city?
Yes.
Golden axe foods.
They all worked and this was tricky,
Some of them under subsidiaries,
Some under shell companies,
Henry birch was for a scholarship, but...
In conclusion, they were all interns at golden axe foods.
I'm familiar with the logo.
They were all over the farms in my home town.
They sell, like, engineered seeds and stuff, it's huge.
I've scoped the security.
Run of the mill guards, boring alarms, when do we break in?
We don't break in, we go in, we ask questions,
No picking fights--
What are you doing?
Sending you to boston.
I present to you the back door.
Yeah, that's the broom closet.
Ah, no!
It is a door
Behind which presently exists the broom closet.
Mr. Stone, hook those up.
Put 'em here.
You see, magic works on similarities.
Uh, symbolic resonance.
Yes.
A voodoo doll is symbolic of a person.
And lead can be transformed into gold
Because it is already similar.
So, with a little magic
And i might add a great deal
Of underappreciated work,
That broom closet door
Can become a symbolic representation
Of any other door.
Oh!
That first step might be just a little--
Yeah, thanks for the warning, jenkins.
This is boston.
You moved the annex to boston?
No, just the door.
Does no one listen?
It's an einstein-rosen bridge.
It's a wormhole.
( giggles )
The back door is on the east coast--
And the front door is still on the west coast.
Wait, we can go anywhere we want in the world?
Absolutely anywhere, that has a door.
Still working out the kinks.
You know, it doesn't stay open very long.
And it's not the most accurate thing.
And most frankly, getting to the right city is a win--
Any door?
Like, say, a bank vault door?
I'm asking for a mate.
We do this, you do what i say, when i say.
Clear?
Good luck.
What?
Nothing.
Go away.
I'm working.
Eight of our interns have gone missing.
Golden axe foods is one of the oldest companies in the world.
Over the decades, the centuries,
No matter war, famine, plague, golden axe
Always prevails and we've done so through integrity.
So the idea of any wrongdoing is--
Well, i for one am shocked.
Franklin, did you know about this?
I'm also shocked.
And your interest in this, miss?
Colonel baird, nato counter-terrorism.
I am less shocked.
( chuckles )
You think our interns were terrorists?
You're a big agribusiness.
You have access to the food supply.
We prefer not to take any chances.
Miss willis?
The tokyo office is on the line.
Not now, jennie.
( door closes )
Well, as ceo of golden axe, i am, of course,
Deeply concerned about this chain of events.
But i don't know how much more i can tell you.
We throughput interns pretty quickly here.
Most don't have the skills to compete.
You can imagine what it's like to deal with utter amateurs.
You know, why don't you speak to human resources?
I'm sure they have the records of the people you're looking for.
Would you show them the way?
Mr. Franklin, tokyo really needs to confirm the shipping price.
Hai.
They know something.
How do you know they know something?
Eight missing interns, they should've buried us in lawyers,
Not danced us straight in to meet karen willis, the ceo.
She wanted to size us up.
Find out what we know.
So they know now that we know something but do we now know
They know something more than just knowing we know something?
I betcha whatever they're about to show us in hr is gonna be faked up.
You know, just for show.
The originals might be on the main server,
If i can find the server room.
We just passed it.
Back there.
Yeah, air seals for climate control.
Most security i've seen on this floor.
Good, you three go to hr.
If she wants to put on a show, you're the audience.
I'm gonna break into the server room.
Uh, ezekiel jones, world-class thief.
Why am i playing audience and you're a burglar?
Because i want the three of you together, safe,
In a place that is very boring.
What i say, when i say it.
Excuse me?
Restroom?
Down the hall.
Go ahead.
I'll catch up.
( speaks japanese )
Please.
I'll wait for your friend.
Room zero-fourteen.
Go left, left, then right.
We should have warned baird that guy was going back after her.
Hey, she's the one who sent us on a snipe hunt.
Let her sweat a little.
What did he say?
Left, left and right?
You are not servers.
Look at this.
Looks like greek frescoes.
This is late helladic, i think.
Now why would these be down here in the basement?
More like, sub-basement.
Did we down a little and nobody noticed?
Guys, can we just hurry up and find human resources?
This lighting is giving me a headache.
Are you sure it's not your brain grape about to pop?
Okay, new rule.
How about we not refer to the tumor that
Will one day kill me as a brain grape?
Ah, here we go.
And i was worried we were getting lost.
We're not in human resources.
Go, go.
Baird!
I'm texting you some pictures.
I found something real weird.
Wow, did you?
We found something weird too!
I found a room full of really old art.
That is weird.
We found a room full of human skulls!
What do you mean human skulls?
How many ways can i mean human skulls?
Left, to left and right, guys.
This doesn't make any sense.
Wait a minute, this is not late helladic.
This is minoan.
There's barely any complete minoan art known to exist.
Minoan.
Why do i know that name?
Greek mythology.
Theseus and the minotaur.
Big monster, head of a bull.
Inescapable labyrinth.
Theseus had a big ball of thread,
Used it so he wouldn't get lost--
This place is kind of labyrinth-y.
And i'm looking at a really old ball of thread.
Well, that's clearly stupid.
There is no way under a skyscraper
We are in a labyrinth.
( groans )
Okay, maybe we are in a labyrinth.
Let's go!
( phone rings )
Yes.
Jenkins, quick question.
Any chance someone could have recreated
The minotaur's labyrinth in a skyscraper in boston?
Goodness, no.
Don't be absurd.
Even assuming that you had enough power,
You would need a, just a magnificent collection
Of ancient minoan artifacts to focus it.
The librarians are in the labyrinth.
I sent them there alone.
Why?
To keep them safe.
That was a very bad idea.
( punching, grunting )
Although i will say i'm impressed.
We've had guardians lose librarians in the past of course.
But never three in one day.
It'll be quite some time before anyone beats that.
So how do we get them out?
We don't.
It's a labyrinth.
The whole point is you can't get out.
Well, what about your magic back door?
Can't you open that inside the labyrinth?
Colonel, i told you, i was lucky we found boston.
I, i can't pinpoint them in a maze.
Okay, so what about that other thing you said,
Symbolic whose-ee-flopper, whatchamacallit, thingamajiggy?
The labyrinth isn't just a maze, it's a magic maze.
All right?
It exists in more than three dimensions
And you know what i seriously doubt?
Putting an extra-dimensional hole
In a multi-dimensional space is a very good idea!
That was not a request.
Guys, wait.
Something isn't--
Hm, just give me a minute.
Wasn't it right, then right, then left?
No, no, no, no, no.
This is not the time, kid.
Okay?
We got to run because--
Do not say because the minotaur is coming.
Because there is no minotaur and i'll tell you why.
In your myth, what's-his-face?
Theseus.
Yeah, right.
He killed the minotaur.
So the minotaur is dead, and if it's dead,
He's not here.
Right?
Right?
( creature roars )
This is wrong.
The hallway we were in before should
Cut through here, but it doesn't.
It's impossible.
Hey, guys, i think we should go this way.
This is great.
Stuck in a magic maze with two of the least reliable people i know.
Wait, least reliable?
You have been on my case non-stop.
Why am i "unreliable"?
Not now, all right?
We got to move.
I know.
I betrayed you that first time, so--
Not now.
Hey.
I was scared.
I have a death sentence inside my head
And they offered me a cure, so what was i supposed to do?
Not sell us out.
So self-righteous.
Look at me and all i've sacrificed;
I'm such a good boy.
Well, i take my responsibility seriously--
Shh.
You made your bed.
I didn't get a choice in mine.
So you don't get to judge me for a--
( gasps )
There's a pattern.
Pattern, pattern.
Pattern, pattern.
Circles inside squares inside triangles.
That's why i have the headache.
My brain knew that we were in a maze before we even really noticed it ourselves.
I can see it.
Kind of.
Can you kind of get us out of here?
Oy!
Whatever issues you two are having, save it.
I saw we follow the brain grape.
We are not calling it a brain grape.
( creature roars )
Follow the brain grape.
This way.
Ha!
Where next?
Kind of more guessing than knowing, but i guess this way.
( gunshots )
One short, one long, two short.
What?
Morse code?
That's an l.
For librarians?
It's baird.
Let's go.
Anyone else worried the monster heard those gunshots, too?
I'm hoping we find baird first.
( creature roars )
( gunshots )
Human resources.
So safe.
So boring.
( creature roars )
Go!
We have to hold out as long as we can!
Well, i'll be damned.
I did not think that would work with a cabinet door.
Go, go!
Symbolic representation of you in the labyrinth.
That's a trick i won't be trying any time soon again.
Ha.
So.
First time out.
How'd it go?
As far as we can tell, ma'am,
She doesn't see to have disturbed anything.
Why was she in here?
She can't know what we're doing unless-- no.
There's only one librarian and he was just spotted in--?
Budapest, i think.
Expedite the timetable just in case.
Start tomorrow, with that blonde idiot at my desk.
Honestly, how hard is it to knock?
And if these people come back?
They won't.
Nobody escapes the labyrinth.
It's the thread.
The thread.
What's all this other stuff?
Magic has three parts.
Power, to change reality.
Focus to direct that change
And an effect that change in the real world.
The effect would be the labyrinth, right?
Created by the focus of the minoan artifacts.
Mr. Stone, you have a knack for this.
But the power that holds it all together,
That's the original thread in the myth.
Millennia old.
"millennia" means thousands of years--
Yes, thank you.
Once you take the thread out,
It would be like taking the battery out of a car.
Yes.
Crude analogy but totally accurate.
We destroy the thread and the entire multi-dimensional
Hoo-ha collapses in on itself with a whoosh.
All we have to do is get past that minotaur.
Everything i have on minotaurs.
Nasty creatures.
Hold a grudge.
I put seven rounds into the thing and it still got back up.
There are many immortal beings that can be injured but not killed.
Nicolas flamel.
The wandering jew.
The black mask, the sources reported him killed
Many times but he always seems to pop up when needed.
If i can't kill this thing, what am i supposed to do?
Colonel, the library chose you for a reason and trust me,
It wasn't because of your ability to kill.
We're not gonna save henry birch.
Well, then we get him justice.
We're here to protect innocent people from out-of-control magic.
I say this qualifies.
Golden axe foods has the labyrinth in its basement.
Tell me why.
Well the myth is that the king imprisoned
The minotaur in the labyrinth.
Every seven years he sends down 14 virgins, seven men, seven women, for sacrifice.
Good luck finding 14 virgins these days.
The greek words for "virgin" are eitheos and parthenos,
They both literally mean unmarried man and woman.
You-- it could mean youth, it could mean inexperienced--
Interns.
Okay?
So in the myth,
What did the king get for his sacrifices?
He gets power.
He gets prosperity and wealth.
"through war, famine and plague, golden axe will always prevail".
The myth calls for fourteen sacrifices.
They're gonna kill six more people
If we don't do anything about it.
Six more people are gonna be screaming, run down by that.
At least.
I mean, this has been going on for centuries,
Who's to say they're ever going to stop?
We have to get that thread.
Have i mentioned, you know, world class thief?
Relentlessly.
So the cases themselves have some heavy-duty security.
Taser nets are built in.
Touch one of the cases without deactivating
The net and zap, 50,000 volts.
But the trick is getting back into that building,
Past that monster and tunneling underground
Is obviously out of the question--
Guys?
That's impossible.
This is exactly like the frescoes that were in the--
We're back in the labyrinth.
Okay, so i've got a phone signal, but no gps.
How is this happening?
Sorry, could you tell me where the nearest subway is?
Sure.
( distorted voice )
Thanks.
Yes?
Jenkins, quick question.
We're on the street outside the annex but we seem to be back in the labyrinth.
Huh.
So, annoying or cryptic, those are your two speeds, huh?
It's possible the labyrinth isn't just a place,
It is a lingering effect.
Like a curse?
Yes.
The labyrinth won't let you out.
It's confusing your senses, warping space around you.
It doesn't matter where you go, you'll get lost,
Eventually wandering back into its clutches.
Fascinating.
So how do we find the thread and shut down the maze
If we're stuck in the maze?
Huh.
If you say "huh" one more time, so help me--
( growls )
Colonel baird!
Colonel baird?
Run!
( snarls )
Jenkins!
The minotaur's in the maze with us!
Get us out of here!
I told you, i cannot pull that trick off twice.
Um...
But perhaps i could use the labyrinth itself
To buy you some time.
He's right behind us!
The labyrinth confuses the senses, distorts space.
I can actually amplify the effect.
If i create a dimensional bubble
Around you so confusing even the minotaur can't find you.
For how long?
Five minutes.
Maybe less, certainly not more.
Good luck, colonel.
Oh, and run.
Come on.
Okay, stay calm.
I've been in worse spots than this before.
Well, that strains credibility.
Stone, you take point.
Ezekiel, watch the rear, there's a high roof up there.
There isn't.
You heard what jenkins said,
The labyrinth is just trying to confuse us.
Even it was there, we couldn't reach it.
It's not a suggestion, it's an order.
And i'm not a soldier!
You're right.
I am, but you're not.
You're librarians.
Librarians win because of what they know.
So, what do you know?
Come on, guys, what do you know?
Theseus.
Bloke from the story.
He went into the maze and killed the minotaur.
The minotaur can't be killed.
Then how did he escape?
You said the minotaur was imprisoned inside the labyrinth.
Every prison i've ever seen had a control center inside the walls.
Your man theseus, maybe he didn't go to the center
To try and kill the minotaur--
Maybe he went to the center to pull the plug on the maze,
Same as us.
You want to bet that maze leads back to those artifacts?
No, because i was in that artifact room, i wasn't--
Keycard.
I used that stolen keycard.
The executive keycards keep them from getting lost in the labyrinth.
We don't try to escape.
We go deeper in.
I can get us to the center.
My brain started trying to figure out the maze when i was in it before.
I've seen, experienced more of it now.
I bet i can get us through.
Okay, cassandra's our thread.
Follow her.
Outrun the minotaur,
Steal the power source for the maze, shut it down.
Librarians, we have a plan.
The labyrinth:
Imagine a building where every floor
Has a different layout.
And sometimes, when you walk around,
You move between floors without even knowing it.
So from your perspective, the layout looks different
But if you know what floor you're on,
It makes perfect sense.
Sure.
Duh.
I just need to know how many floors are in the building.
That number, all the core geometry is gonna be based on that.
- Without it-- - it should be seven.
Seven's the number.
The myth is built on seven.
Seven male victims.
Seven female, sacrificed every seven years.
Seven.
Seven is violet.
Three seven-dimensional polytypes:
Seven simplex, seven-cube and the seven-orthoplex.
There aren't enough vertices.
It's a demihepteract!
Gotcha!
Okay.
Is this the way in?
It's the way back to the annex.
Probably.
Maybe.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Where are you going?
We have to split up.
And you don't want to be in the labyrinth when it goes poof.
We're staying together.
I'm not letting you out of my sight again.
If we stick together he's got us.
This doesn't work unless someone distracts mister stompy.
Fine, i'll distract him.
On your own, you don't stand a chance.
And if he kills you, then he's gonna chase us down.
So we send these two in alone?
Cassandra to find the center, me to grab the thread.
It's the only way.
You can't protect us all.
( sighs )
How much time do you need?
Ten minutes to find the center.
Five to crack the case holding the thread.
15 minutes.
Check.
Don't jump the gun.
Don't lose the bull.
And don't stray off the path.
Good hunting.
Remember, we do this--
I know-- smarter, not harder.
I got it.
( minotaur growls )
Yo!
( whistles )
Come on, boy.
Okay, which way to the center?
That way.
No, wait.
That way.
You sure?
Back off, i'm doing math.
That way.
He's gaining on us.
Seven times seven is forty-nine.
Forty-nine times seven is three-forty-three.
Wait.
It's here.
It's right here.
Good for math.
This way!
We're not gonna make it.
What are you doing?
I'll buy you as much time as i can.
- What?
- Go!
No!
Baird!
( roars )
--Seven points on a heptagon--
Seven is a mersenne prime,
Two to the third minus one equals seven---
I--
I can't do it.
No, i can't do it.
Seven dimensions is-- it's too much.
I can't.
Seven's nothing.
Leaves you with what, three fingers?
I once stole a gun out of a cop's hand using three fingers.
Stone was right.
You can't trust me.
I'll let everyone down.
( sighs )
If i was in your shoes, with that thing
Growing in my head,
I'd have sold everybody out for a cure, too.
The only difference is, i would have stuck the landing.
Let flynn die.
Let the serpent brotherhood win.
Let the world burn.
But you didn't.
Yeah, you screwed people over but you didn't let them down.
I can't hold it though, it's too much.
So close your eyes.
Focus on your other senses.
My other senses and i don't get along so well.
Brain grape.
So i'll be your other senses.
Shut your eyes and see the map inside your head.
I'll lead you through.
You really trust me to do that?
( scoffs )
I'm the thief that bails on everybody.
Pretty sure you're the one trusting me.
Okay.
We need to go down and to the left.
That's good.
Good.
Good.
( roars )
( grunts )
Look at that.
Smarter and harder.
You did it.
We made it.
You okay?
Yeah.
Go.
I just need to count down from seven.
Seven is violet, six is indigo, five is blue--
Shut down the tasers, pop the case, grab the thread.
Five minutes is all we need.
You don't have it.
Who are you?
We're the librarians.
We accept your surrender.
There's only one librarian and you are not him.
But something has changed.
There's more magic in the world, more power to our sacrifices.
Golden axe, in one form or another has been
Sacrificing innocents to the labyrinth for 3,000 years
And we have never seen a stock bump like we got
Off our last offering.
We made it.
Is it still behind us?
Assume yes.
You are the first modern people to reach the center.
No intern has ever managed that.
Kids today.
There's no initiative!
You are a more old-fashioned,
Ritual sacrifice kind of person?
I single-handedly modernized the process.
I said, "let's amortize".
Spread the sacrifices out over the year instead of doing them all at once.
Increases the overhead but the decrease in visibility
Means your return on investment is even higher on a per-intern basis.
Hey.
You got to spend money to make money.
I get it.
Let's say we all part as friends--
You know, i'm not sure if shooting you here
Counts towards our fourteen
Or if the minotaur has to make the kill itself.
I guess i'll find out tomorrow when i see the market returns.
Oh!
Oh!
( gunshot )
( growls )
Only two of you?
I never thought they were cut out for--
( banging )
Is that thing trying to get into my annex?
You led that back to my--?
Not now!
Hey!
This is delicate.
( alarm rings )
That's good, too.
Come on, then.
Give me that thread.
If you drop it, we're all doomed.
Uh, any ideas?
Hey, let's be professional.
I have the resources.
You obviously have the talent.
Name your price.
Double if you take it in stock options.
Jenkins.
He said that magic depends on symbols.
What better symbol of a labyrinth than
A straight line rapped around and around and around itself?
Here.
Catch!
( rumbling )
( roars )
The labyrinth!
The labyrinth!
( rushing wind )
I believe i said with a "whoosh".
Cassandra, jones!
Whoa!
Got it.
Ha ha!
( wind rushes )
Whoa!
We made it.
Yeah.
You did.
This time, you did.
You should have seen her.
No hiding.
Took the fight right to the big bad.
And ezekiel.
He did kind of save the day by bailing on me.
I told you.
I don't do punchy.
Well done.
May i?
Now without this to serve as a power source,
The labyrinth should shrivel up and wink out of existence.
Eventually.
We ought to lock that up.
Yes.
Well, we don't have the facilities
Of the main library, but i'll think of something.
What about willis?
I mean, i know we stopped her, but shouldn't she go to jail
Or something for what she did to henry birch and the others?
I wouldn't worry about ms.
Willis.
She imprisoned a minotaur.
Nasty creatures.
Hold a grudge.
Those people do not know who they're messing with.
Librarians or not, we will find them,
Destroy them and get back what we--
( roaring )
( stomping )
( roars )
Hey.
Look, um, things got a little heated in there--
Don't worry about it.
I'm not.
Kind of worried about what you said to me.
You know, if we're gonna work together,
You're gonna need to trust--
Nobody knows.
Nobody back home knows about this.
I have kept it a secret
For twenty years.
Why would you hide that?
You're a genius, you know about culture
And art and beautiful things.
I told you before, family ain't ever easy.
For me...
You don't-- no.
That's enough for now.
The point is, i'm used to keeping my life separated.
All right?
My family, my friends, i love 'em.
I like 'em.
No problem working right along side of them.
Any of them.
But i don't trust a single one of 'em to tell them...
I mean, can you imagine meeting flynn,
Meeting you,
Meeting baird
And the thief.
Finding out about this library.
Finding people i could trust.
Well, you know how that felt?
I do.
I really do.
And then to have it broken?
I like you, cassie.
There's no way around it, i just do.
But i trusted you and,
Uh, i learned my lesson.
Not, it's not--
Look, it always ends bad so--
Old way's best.
So, end of day, not too bad for a first time out, was it?
You did okay.
I, i could do better.
I spent my entire adult life in the military.
Everybody fits into a box.
You don't.
You're not assets to be protected,
You're not soldiers i can order around.
I don't know what you are.
Well, maybe the term you're looking for is "partners".
Fair enough.
Can you go back to the part where you said we were awesome?
I said you did okay.
Yeah, but i'm gonna take that as "we rule."
Mostly me.
You guys were okay.
Okay?
I did math.
True.
Points for math.
Stone, though, you mostly just got beat up.
I do rule.
[Roaring]
- [Thudding]
- Help!
Somebody help me!
- [Roaring continues]
- Somebody help me!
Help me!
Help me!
[Grunts]
Help me!
Please!
You have to help me!
Please!
- [Speaking ancient Greek]
- No!
- [Roaring]
- No!
Help!
No!
No!
Help me!
[Keypad beeps]
Hey, what's that place with the great turkey panini?
- Mancolo's.
- [Elevator bell dings]
[Sighs]
No.
No, the...
Oh, um...
Castellani's.
Mmm.
Order lunch from there for the department budget meeting.
I love that panini.
Go, go, go!
[Grunts]
[Groans]
[Sighs]
[Grunts]
[Thud] [Gasps]
[Thud] Ohh!
[Sighs]
It took me two minutes to disable all three of you.
Stone, you've got an IQ of 190.
You should know you can't solve everything with brute force alone.
It's worked so far.
Fight smarter, not harder.
Still, at least you can fight.
Ezekiel bailed on his team.
These are the hands of a world-class thief.
- I don't do punchy.
- And Cassandra hid... badly.
I am here to do science and math and occasionally hallucinate.
You're just not being fair.
You think I'm not fair, wait until you meet the bad guys, which is why we'll run drills again tomorrow and every day until I'm sure I can take you out into the field with even a chance of you coming back in one piece.
Oh, how substandard were they?
Good pep talk, Jenkins.
While you were out, a new page appeared in the clipping book.
- Looks fascinating.
- No!
Not yet!
Well, this is crazy.
Every day, a new page shows up of weird newspaper clippings in this book.
And every day, you tell us to ignore it.
We've hardly opened it since the day Flynn left.
Because you're not ready.
Flynn told us we were supposed to help people.
Yeah.
Ezekiel's right.
Flynn gave us a job.
We're supposed to be checking out the... weird...
Not sit around here.
Ezekiel's right.
I said that.
Jenkins, stay out...
Marvelous, isn't it?
I told you, this is where I do my research.
Judson always insists that we just lock the artifacts away.
But I experiment on them, study them, improve them.
Ha.
It's hard enough to rein them in without you dangling that clippings book in front of them.
Why rein them?
You've got to put them in the field sooner or later.
I've gone into the field with experienced soldiers with a good plan, good Intel, and still come home with nothing but dog tags.
I'm talking soldiers with training who've seen combat.
These three...
I promised Flynn I'd keep them alive.
They're not even close to ready.
We're doing this, right?
Hell yeah, we are.
Let's go.
I appreciate you wanting to keep them out of harm's way, but librarians exist to keep magic out of the wrong hands.
Their job is to be in harm's way.
I can't protect three of them at once and they can't take care of themselves, not without a lot more training.
We used to put librarians in the field
- with no training at all.
- Oh, yeah?
And how many came back?
The best ones.
- I said...
- Henry Birch, 21.
He was on a full scholarship in chemical engineering at Boston university.
He went missing two days ago.
Seven other clippings, all missing people disappeared this year.
- That many, the police are on it.
- Ezekiel:
Nope.
The victims are from all around the country.
The only reason to suspect they're connected is that
- they all showed up in our magic book.
- That's eight people gone.
Maybe dead.
We don't...
I mean, you know?
And how many more are gonna go missing before we step in?
What if he's still alive?
What if we have a chance to save Henry Birch and we don't?
And you're willing to risk your lives for him?
I won't risk my life.
But...
I assume I can outrun anything, so I'm in.
[Breathes deeply]
Fine.
But we're going in with a plan.
I want full breakdowns on the missing, backgrounds on their work places, magical and supernatural possibilities.
Oh, God.
What have I done?
Even though the victims were from all over, they all disappeared in Boston.
Any connection beyond the city?
Yes.
Golden Axe foods.
They all worked... and this was tricky... some of them under subsidiaries, some under shell companies,
Henry Birch was for his scholarship, but... in conclusion, they were all interns at Golden Axe foods.
Yeah.
I'm familiar with the logo.
They were all over the farms in my hometown.
And they sell, like, engineered seeds and stuff.
It's huge.
I've scouted the security.
Run-of-the-mill guards, boring alarms.
When do we break in?
We don't break in.
We go in.
We ask questions.
No picking fights.
What... what... what are you doing?
Sending you to Boston.
I present to you...
The back door.
Yeah, that's the broom closet.
Ah, no... it is a door behind which presently exists the broom closet.
Mr. Stone, hook those up.
Put them here.
You see, magic works on similarities.
Uh, a symbolic resonance.
Yes.
Uh, a voodoo doll is symbolic of a person.
And lead can be transformed into gold because it is already similar.
So, with a little...
Magic...
That broom-closet door can become a symbolic representation of any other door.
[Bell ringing]
Ohh!
Ow.
Uh, s... uh, that first step might be just a little...
Baird:
Hey, yeah, thanks for the warning, Jenkins.
Th-this is Boston.
You moved the annex to Boston?
No.
Just the door.
Does no one listen?
It's an Einstein-Rosen bridge.
It's a wormhole. [Chuckles]
The back door's on the east coast...
And the front door...
Is still on the west coast.
[Giggles]
Wait, wait.
We can go anywhere we want in the world?
Absolutely anywhere that has a door.
Still working out the kinks.
You know, it doesn't stay open very long and it's not the most accurate thing.
Well, frankly, getting the right city is a win.
[Chuckles]
Any door?
Like, say...
A bank-vault door?
I'm asking for a mate.
We do this, you do what I say, when I say.
Clear?
- Good luck.
- What?
Nothing.
Go away.
I'm working.
Willis:
Eight of our interns have gone missing.
[Sighs]
Golden Axe foods is one of the oldest companies in the world.
Over the decades... the... centuries, no matter war, famine, plague,
Golden Axe always prevails.
And we've done so through integrity.
So the idea of any wrongdoing is...
[Sighs]
Well, I, for one, am shocked.
Franklin, did you know about this?
I'm also shocked.
And your interest in this, Miss...
Colonel Baird, NATO Counterterrorism.
I am less shocked.
You think our interns were terrorists?
You're big agribusiness.
You have access to the food supply.
We prefer not to take any chances.
Miss Willis?
The Tokyo office is on the line.
Not now, Jennie.
[Door closes]
Well, as C.E.O. of Golden Axe,
I am, of course, deeply concerned about this chain of events.
But I don't know how much more I can tell you.
We throughput interns pretty quickly here.
Most don't have the skills to compete.
You know, why don't you speak to Human Resources?
I'm sure they have the records of the people you're looking for.
Would you show them the way?
Mr. Franklin, Tokyo really needs to confirm
- the shipping price.
- Hai?
- They know something.
- How do you know they know something?
Eight missing interns, they should have buried us in lawyers, not danced us straight in to meet Karen Willis, the C.E.O.
She wanted to size us up, find out what we know.
So, they now know that we know something?
But do we now know that they know something more
- than just knowing we know something?
- I'll bet you whatever they're about to show us in the H.R.
Is gonna be faked up, you know, just for show.
The originals might be on the main server if I can find the server room.
We just passed it back there.
Yeah, air seals for climate control, most security I've seen on this floor.
Good.
You three go to H.R.
If she wants to put on a show, you're the audience.
I'm gonna break into the server room.
Uh, Ezekiel Jones, world-class thief.
Why am I playing audience and you're burglar?
Because I want the three of you together, safe, in a place that is very boring.
What I say, when I say it.
Excuse me?
Restroom?
Down the hall.
Go ahead.
I'll catch up.
Hai.
Domo.
Please.
I'll wait for your friend.
Room 014.
Go left, left, then right.
[Elevator bell dings]
[Indistinct conversations]
[Elevator bell dings]
We should have warned Baird that guy was going back after her.
Hey, she's the one who sends us on a snipe hunt.
Let her sweat a little.
What did he say, a left, a left, and a right?
You are not servers.
Look at this.
Looks like Greek frescos.
This is late Helladic, I think.
Now, why would these be down here in the basement?
More like subbasement.
Did we go down a level and nobody noticed?
Guys, could we just hurry up and find Human Resources?
This lighting is giving me a headache.
Are you sure it's not your brain grape about to pop?
Okay, new rule... how about we not refer to
- the tumor that will one day kill me as a "brain grape"?
- Ah.
Here we go.
And I was worried we were getting lost.
You are not Human Resources.
Go.
Go.
[Camera shutter clicking]
- [Dialing, ringing]
- Baird!
I'm texting you some pictures.
I found something real weird.
Oh, did you?
We found something weird, too.
I found a room full of really old art.
That is weird.
We found a room full of human skulls!
What do you mean, human skulls?
How many ways can I mean "human skulls"?
Left, then left, then right guys.
- This doesn't make any sense.
- Wait a minute.
This is not late Helladic.
This is Minoan.
There's barely any complete Minoan art known to exist.
Minoan.
Why do I know that name?
Greek mythology.
Theseus and the Minotaur.
Big monster.
Head of a bull, inescapable labyrinth.
Theseus had a big ball of thread.
He used it so he wouldn't get lost.
This place is... kind of labyrinth-y.
And I'm looking at a really old ball of thread.
Ezekiel:
Well, that's clearly stupid.
There is no way, under a skyscraper, we're in a labyrinth.
Oh!
Okay.
Maybe we are in a labyrinth.
Let's go.
[Telephone rings]
Yes?
Jenkins, quick question.
Any chance someone could have re-created the Minotaur's labyrinth in a skyscraper in Boston?
Goodness, no.
Don't be absurd.
Even assuming you had enough power, you would need a magnificent collection of ancient Minoan artifacts to focus it.
The Librarians are in the labyrinth.
I sent them there alone.
Why?
To keep them safe.
That was a very bad idea.
[Grunting, thudding]
Uh, although I will say I'm impressed.
We've had guardians lose Librarians in the past, of course, but never three in one day.
It will be quite some time before anyone beats that.
So how do we get them out?
You don't.
It's a labyrinth.
The whole point is you can't get out.
Well, what about your magic back door?
Can't you open that inside the labyrinth?
Colonel, I told you, I was lucky we found Boston.
I-I can't pinpoint them in the maze.
Okay, so what about that other thing you said, symbolic whosey-flopper whatchamacallit thingamajigy?
The labyrinth isn't just a maze.
It's a magic maze, all right?
It exists in more than three dimensions.
And you know what I seriously doubt?
Putting an extra-dimensional hole in a multi-dimensional space is a very good idea.
That was not a request.
Guys, wait.
Something isn't...
Mm.
Just give me a minute.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
This is not the time, kid, okay?
- We got to run because...
- No!
No, no, no, no.
Do not say "because the Minotaur is coming."
Because there is no Minotaur, and I'll tell you why.
In your myth, uh, what's-his-face?
Theseus!
Yeah, right.
He killed the Minotaur.
So the Minotaur is dead.
And if he's dead, he's not here.
Right?
[Growling in distance]
Right?
Right?
[Thudding] [Growling]
[Elevator bell dings]
[Elevator bell dings]
Ugh.
This is wrong.
The hallway we were in before should cut through here.
But it doesn't.
I-it's impossible.
Wait, guys.
I think we should go this way.
That's great.
I'm stuck in a magic maze with two of the least reliable people I know.
Wait.
Least reliable?
You know what?
You have been on my case nonstop.
Why am I unreliable?
Not now, all right?
We got to move.
I know.
I betrayed you that first time, so...
Not now.
Hey.
I was scared.
I have a death sentence inside my head and they offered me a cure, so what was I supposed to do?
Not sell us out.
So self-righteous.
"Look at me and all I've sacrificed.
I'm such a good boy."
Well, I take my responsibilities seriously.
- Shh!
- And you made your bed.
I didn't get a choice in mine.
So you don't get to judge me for... [gasps]
There's a pattern.
Pattern, pattern.
Pattern, pattern.
Circles insides of squares inside of triangles.
That's why I have the headache.
My brain knew that we were in a maze before we even realized it ourselves.
I can see it.
Kind of.
Can you kind of get us out of here?
Oi!
Whatever issues you two are having, save it.
I say we follow the brain grape.
We are not calling it a brain grape!
[Roaring]
Follow the brain grape.
This way.
Ha!
- Where next?
- Kind of more guessing than knowing, but...
I guess this way.
[Two gunshots]
One short, one long, two short.
What, Morse code?
It's an "L" For "Librarians"?
It's Baird.
Let's go.
Anyone else worried that the monster heard
- those gunshots, too?
- I'm hoping we find Baird first.
[Growling]
[Roars]
[Gunshots]
[Snorts]
Human resources... so safe, so boring.
[Snorts]
Go on.
Come on.
Do it, do it.
[Roars] Ooh!
We have to hold out as long as we can!
Jenkins:
Well, I'll be damned.
I did not think that would work with a cabinet door.
Go!
Go!
[Roars]
[Powering down]
[Gun cocks]
[Bell ringing]
Uh, a symbolic representation of you in the labyrinth.
That's a trick I won't be trying anytime soon again.
So...
First time out.
How did it go?
[Sighs] [Sword clatters]
As far as we can tell, ma'am, she doesn't seem
- to have disturbed anything.
- Why was she in here?
She can't know what we're doing unless...
[Sighs] No, there's only one Librarian,
- and he was just spotted in...
- Budapest, I think.
Expedite the time table just in case.
Start tomorrow with that blonde idiot at my desk.
Honestly, how hard is it to knock?
And if these people come back?
They won't.
Nobody escapes the labyrinth.
It's the thread.
The thread?
There's all this other stuff.
Magic has three parts...
power to change reality, focus to direct that change, and an effect, that change in the real world.
The effect would be the labyrinth, right?
Mm-hmm.
Created by the focus of the Minoan artifacts.
Mr. Stone, you have a knack for this.
[Chuckles]
But the power that holds it all together, that's the original thread in the myth, millennia old.
- Millennia means thousands of years.
- Yes, thank you.
If you take the thread out, it would be like taking the battery out of a car.
Yes.
Crude analogy, but totally accurate.
We destroy the thread, and the entire multi-dimensional hoo-ha collapses in on itself with a whoosh.
All we have to do is get past that Minotaur.
Yeah.
Everything I have on minotaurs.
Nasty creatures, hold a grudge.
I put seven rounds into the thing, and it still got back up.
There are many immortal beings that can be injured but not killed.
Nicholas Flamel, the wandering Jew, the black mask.
Sources reported him killed many times, but he always seems to pop up when needed.
If I can't kill this thing, what am I supposed to do?
Colonel, the library chose you for a reason.
And, trust me, it wasn't because of your ability to kill.
We're not gonna save Henry Birch.
Well, then, we get him justice.
We're here to protect innocent people from out-of-control magic.
I say this qualifies.
Golden Axe Foods has the labyrinth in its basement.
Tell me why.
Well, the myth is that the King imprisoned the Minotaur in the labyrinth.
Every 7 years, he sends down 14 virgins... seven men, seven women...
for a sacrifice.
Good luck finding 14 virgins these days.
The Greek words for "virgin" are eitheos and parthenos.
They both literally mean unmarried man and woman.
It could mean youth, it could mean inexperience.
Interns.
Okay.
So, in the myth, what did the King get for his sacrifices?
He gets power.
He gets prosperity and wealth.
"Through war, famine, plague, Golden Axe will always prevail."
The myth calls for 14 sacrifices.
They're gonna kill six more people if we don't do anything about it.
Six more people are gonna be screaming, run down by that.
At least.
I mean, this has been going on for centuries.
Who's to say they're ever gonna stop?
We have to get that thread.
Have I mentioned you know a world-class thief?
Relentlessly.
So, the cases themselves have some heavy-duty security.
Paulco taser nets are built-in.
Touch one of the cases without deactivating the nets, and, zap, 50,000 volts.
But the trick is getting back into that building, past that monster.
And tunneling underground is obviously out of the question.
Cassandra:
Guys.
That's impossible.
This is exactly like the frescos that were in the...
[Sighs]
We're back in the labyrinth.
[Sniffs]
Okay.
So, I've got a phone signal but no GPS.
How is this happening?
Sorry.
Could you tell me where the nearest subway is?
[Distorted] Sure... take a raft at Boybridge Street, go four blocks down, then go late at mart.
Oh, and here in Bossville, we call it the Q.
- Thanks.
- [Dialing]
- [Sighs]
- Jenkins:
Yes?
Jenkins, quick question.
We're on the street outside the annex but we seem to be back in the labyrinth.
Huh.
So...
Annoying or cryptic, those are your two speeds, huh?
It's possible the labyrinth isn't just a place.
It... is a lingering effect.
- Like a curse?
- Yes.
The labyrinth won't let you out.
It's confusing your senses, warping space around you.
It doesn't matter where you go, you'll get lost, eventually wandering back into its clutches.
Fascinating.
So, how do we find the thread and shut down the maze if we're stuck in the maze?
Huh.
If you say "huh" one more time, so help me... [growls]
Colonel Baird.
Colonel Baird?
!
[Growls]
[Roars]
[Growls]
Run!
[Roars]
Jenkins, the Minotaur's in the maze with us.
- Get us out of here!
- I told you,
I cannot pull that trick off twice.
Um...
But...
Perhaps I could use the labyrinth itself to buy you some time.
He's right behind us!
The labyrinth, well, it confuses senses, distorts space.
I can actually amplify that effect, create a-a dimensional bubble around you, so confusing even the Minotaur can't find you.
For how long?
Uh, five minutes.
Maybe less.
Certainly not more.
Uh, good luck, Colonel.
Oh, and run.
Come on.
Okay.
Stay calm.
I've been in worse spots than this before.
Well, that strains credibility.
- Stone, you take point.
- All right.
Ezekiel, watch the rear.
- And there's a high roof up there.
- Cassandra:
There isn't.
You heard what Jenkins said.
The labyrinth is just trying to confuse us.
Even if it was there, we couldn't reach it.
It's not a suggestion.
It's an order.
And I'm not a soldier.
[Sighs] You're right.
I am, but you're not.
You're librarians.
Librarians win because of what they know.
So, what do you know?
Come on, guys.
What do you know?
Uh, Theseus, bloke from the story, he went into the maze and killed the Minotaur.
A Minotaur can't be killed.
Well, then, how did he escape?
You said the Minotaur was imprisoned inside the labyrinth.
Every prison I've ever seen had a control center inside the walls.
Your man Theseus, maybe he didn't go to the center to try and kill the Minotaur.
Maybe he went to the center to pull the plug on the maze,
- same as us.
- What do you want to bet that maze leads back to those artifacts?
No, 'cause I was in that artifacts room and I wasn't... key card.
I used that stolen key card.
The executive key cards keep them from getting lost in the labyrinth.
We don't try to escape.
We go deeper in.
Cassandra:
I can get us to the center.
My brain started trying to figure out the maze when I was in it before.
I've seen, experienced more of it now.
I bet I can get us through.
Okay.
Cassandra's our thread.
Follow her.
Outrun the Minotaur, steal the power source for the maze, shut it down.
Librarians, we have a plan.
The labyrinth.
Imagine a building where every floor has a different layout.
Sometimes, when you walk around, you move between floors without even knowing it.
So, from your perspective, the layout looks different.
But if you know what floor you're on,
- it makes perfect sense.
- Sure.
Duh.
Just need to know how many floors are in the building.
That number, all the core geometry's gonna be based on that.
Without it...
It's gonna be seven.
Seven's the number.
The myth is built on seven.
Seven male victims, seven female, sacrificed every seven years.
Seven.
Seven is violet.
Three seven-dimensional polytypes.
Seven-simplex, seven-cube, seven-orthoplex.
There aren't enough vertices.
It's a demihepteract.
Gotcha.
Okay.
Is this the way in?
It's the way back to the annex.
Probably.
Maybe.
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Where are you going?
We have to split up, and you don't want to be
- in the labyrinth when it goes poof.
- We're staying together.
I'm not letting you out of my sight again.
If we stick together, he's got us.
This doesn't work unless someone distracts Mr. Stompy.
Fine.
I'll distract him.
On your own, you don't stand a chance.
And if he kills you, then he's gonna chase us down.
So we send these two in alone?
Oh, Cassandra to find the center, me to grab the thread.
It's the only way.
You can't protect us all.
[Sighs] How much time do you need?
10 minutes to find the center.
Five to crack the case holding the thread.
15 minutes, check.
- Don't jump the gun.
- Don't lose the bull.
And don't stray off the path.
Good hunting.
Remember, we do this...
I know.
Smarter, not harder.
I got it.
[Minotaur growling]
Yo!
[Whistles] Come on, boy.
He's gaining on us.
7 times 7 is 49. 49 times 7 is 343.
Wait.
It's here.
It's right here.
[Chuckles] Good for math.
This way!
We're not gonna make it.
What are you doing?
I'll buy you as much time as I can.
- What?
- Go!
No!
Baird!
[Roars]
[Grunts]
[Roars]
Seven points on a heptagon.
Seven is a mersenne prime.
Two to the third minus one equals seven.
[Sighs]
[Creaking]
I...
I can't do it.
No, I can't do it.
Seven dimensions.
It's... it's too much.
I can't.
- Ezekiel:
Seven's nothing.
- Mm-hmm.
Leaves you with, what, three fingers?
I once stole a gun out of a cop's hand using three fingers.
Stone was right.
You can't trust me.
I let everyone down.
If I was in your shoes, with that thing growing in my head,
I'd have sold everybody out for a cure, too.
The only difference is, I would have stuck the landing, let Flynn die, let the Serpent Brotherhood win, let the world burn.
But you didn't.
Yeah, you screwed people over, but you didn't let them down.
I just can't hold it, though.
It's too much.
So, close your eyes.
Focus on your other senses.
My other senses and I don't get along so well.
Brain grape.
So I'll be your other senses.
Shut your eyes and see the map inside your head.
I'll lead you through.
You really trust me to do that?
[Chuckles]
I'm the thief that bails on everybody.
Pretty sure you're the one trusting me.
Okay. [Sighs]
We need to go down and to the left.
That's good.
Good.
Good.
[Roars]
Ohh!
[Roars]
Look at that... smarter and harder.
[Tires screech]
[Gasps]
You did it.
We made it.
- Oh.
- [Gasps]
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Go.
I just need to count down from seven.
Seven is violet.
Six is indigo.
Five is blue.
Shut down the tasers, pop the case,
- and grab the thread.
- Four...
Five minutes is all we need.
[Gun cocks] You don't have it.
Who are you?
[Sighs] We're the Librarians.
We accept your surrender.
There's only one Librarian, and you are not him.
But something has changed.
There's more magic in the world, more power to our sacrifices.
Golden Axe, in one form or another, has been sacrificing innocents to the labyrinth for 3,000 years and we have never seen a stock bump like we got off our last offering.
[Tires screech]
We made it.
Is he still behind us?
Assume yes.
You are the first modern people to reach the center.
No intern has ever managed that.
Kids today, there's no initiative.
You're a more old-fashioned, ritual-sacrifice kind of person.
I single-handedly modernized the process.
I said, "let's amortize."
Spread the sacrifices out over the year instead of doing them all at once.
Increases the overhead, but the decrease in visibility means the return on investment is even higher on a per-intern basis.
Hey, you got to spend money to make money.
I get it.
Let's say we all part as friends.
You know, I'm not sure if shooting you here counts towards our 14 or if the Minotaur has to make the kill itself.
I guess I'll find out tomorrow when I see the market returns.
Oh!
[Gunshot]
[Roars]
Huh.
Only two of you.
Frankly, I never thought that they were cut out for... [banging] That thing is trying to get into my annex?
[Grunting]
You led that back here?
Not now!
Aah!
Oh!
Hey!
This is delicate.
That's good, too.
[Grunts]
Come on, then.
Give me that thread.
If you drop it, we're all doomed.
Uh, any ideas?
Jenkins.
He said that magic depends on symbols.
What better symbol of our labyrinth than a straight line wrapped around and around and around itself?
Here, catch.
No!
[Rumbling]
[Grunting]
[Wind blowing]
[Gasping] The labyrinth.
The labyrinth!
[Wind blowing]
I believe I said, "with a whoosh!"
Cassandra.
Jones.
[Grunts]
Got it.
Ha. [Chuckles]
Whoa!
[Grunts]
- Come on.
- [Gasps]
[Grunting]
We made it.
Yeah.
You did.
This time, you did.
Okay.
Ezekiel:
Should have seen her.
No hiding, took the fight right to the big bad.
And Ezekiel, I mean, he did kind of save the day by bailing on me.
Told you.
I don't do punchy.
Well done.
May I?
Now, without this to serve as a power source, the labyrinth should shrivel up and wink out of existence, eventually.
We ought to lock that up.
Yes, well, we don't have the facilities of the main library, but I'll think of something.
What about Willis?
I mean, I know we stopped her, but shouldn't she go to jail or something for what she did to Henry Birch and the others?
I wouldn't worry about Ms. Willis.
She imprisoned a Minotaur... nasty creatures.
Hold a grudge.
Those people do not know who they're messing with.
Librarians or not, we will find them, destroy them, and get back what we have... [roaring in distance]
[Roaring]
Hey.
Look, um, things got a little heated in there.
Don't worry about it.
I'm not.
I'm kind of worried about what you said to me.
You know, if we're gonna work together,
- you're gonna need to trust...
- Nobody knows.
Nobody back home knows about this.
I have kept it a secret...
for 20 years.
Why would you hide that?
You're a genius.
You know about culture and art and beautiful things.
I told you before.
Family ain't ever easy.
You don't... no.
That's enough for now.
Look... the point is,
I'm used to keeping my life separated, all right?
My family, my friends, I like 'em.
No problem.
Work right alongside 'em, any of 'em.
But I don't trust a single one of them...
To tell m...
I like you, Cassie.
There's no way around it.
I just do.
But I trusted you, and, uh...
I learned my lesson.
Um, not... it's not...
look.
It always ends bad.
So...
Old way's best.
So, end of day, not too bad for a first time out, was it?
You did okay.
I...
I could do better.
I spent my entire adult life in the military.
Everybody fits into a box.
You don't.
You're not assets to be protected.
You're not soldiers I can order around.
I don't know what you are.
Well, maybe the term you're looking for is "partners."
Fair enough.
Can you go back to the part where you said we were awesome?
I said you did okay.
Yeah, but I'm gonna take that as we rule.
Mostly me.
You guys were... okay.
- "Okay"?
I did math.
- True.
- Points for math.
- Thank you.
Stone, though, you mostly just got beat up.
[Sighs]
I do rule.
Help!
Somebody help me!
Somebody help me!
Help me, please, you have to help me!
Please!
Hey, what's that place with great turkey panini?
Mancolo's.
Castellani's.
Order lunch from there for the department budget meeting.
Love that panini.
It took me two minutes to disable all three of you.
Stone, you've got an IQ of 190.
You should know you can't solve everything with brute force alone.
It's worked so far.
Fight smarter, not harder.
Still, at least you can fight.
Ezekiel bailed on his team.
These are the hands of a world-class thief.
I don't do punchy.
And Cassandra hid.
Badly.
I'm here to do science and math.
And occasionally hallucinate.
You're just not being fair.
You think I'm not fair, wait until you meet
The bad guys, which is why we'll run drills again tomorrow
And every day until I'm sure I can take you out
Into the field with even a chance of you coming back in one piece.
How substandard were they?
Good pep talk, Jenkins.
While you were out, a new page appeared in the clipping book.
Looks fascinating.
No.
Not yet.
Well, this is crazy.
Every day a new page shows up
Of weird newspaper clippings in this book.
And every day you tell us to ignore it.
We've hardly opened it since the day Flynn left.
Because you're not ready.
Flynn told us we were supposed to help people.
Ezekiel's right.
Flynn gave us a job.
We're supposed to be checking out the weird...
Not sit around here.
Ezekiel's right.
I said that.
Jenkins, stay out...
Marvelous, isn't it?
I told you, this is where I do my research.
Judson always insisted we just lock the artifacts away
But I experiment on them, study them.
Improve them.
It's hard enough to rein them in without you dangling
That clippings book in front of them.
Why rein them?
You'll have to put them in the field sooner or later.
I've gone into the field with experienced soldiers
With a good plan, good intel and still come home
With nothing but dog tags.
I'm talking soldiers with training who've seen combat.
These three?
I promised Flynn I'd keep them alive.
They're not even close to ready.
We're doing this, right?
Hell yeah, we are.
Let's go.
I appreciate you wanting to keep them out of harm's way.
But Librarians exist to keep magic out of the wrong hands.
Their job is to be in harm's way.
I can't protect three of them at once
And they can't take care of themselves.
Not without a lot more training.
We used to put Librarians in the field with no training at all.
Yeah?
And how many came back?
The best ones.
I said...
Henry Birch.
Twenty-one.
He was on a full-scholarship in chemical engineering at Boston university.
He went missing two days ago.
Seven other clippings, all missing people, disappeared this year.
That many, the police are on it.
Nope.
Victims are from all around the country.
The only reason to suspect they're connected
Is that they all showed up in our magic book.
That's eight people gone.
Maybe dead.
We don't have any... you know?
How many more are gonna go missing before we step in?
What if he's still alive?
What if we have a chance to save Henry Birch and we don't?
And you're willing to risk your lives for him?
I won't risk my life.
But I assume I can outrun anything, so I'm in.
Fine, but we're going in with a plan.
I want full breakdowns on the missing,
Backgrounds on their workplaces,
Magical and supernatural possibilities.
God, what have I done?
Even though the victims were from all over,
They all disappeared in Boston.
Any connection beyond the city?
Yes.
Golden axe foods.
They all worked and this was tricky,
Some of them under subsidiaries,
Some under shell companies,
Henry Birch was for a scholarship, but...
In conclusion, they were all interns at golden axe foods.
I'm familiar with the logo.
They were all over the farms in my home town.
They sell, like, engineered seeds and stuff, it's huge.
I've scoped the security.
Run of the mill guards, boring alarms, when do we break in?
We don't break in, we go in, we ask questions,
No picking fights...
What are you doing?
Sending you to Boston.
I present to you the back door.
Yeah, that's the broom closet.
No!
It is a door
Behind which presently exists the broom closet.
Mr. Stone, hook those up.
Put 'em here.
You see, magic works on similarities.
Symbolic resonance.
Yes.
A voodoo doll is symbolic of a person.
And lead can be transformed into gold
Because it is already similar.
So, with a little magic
And I might add a great deal
Of underappreciated work,
That broom closet door
Can become a symbolic representation
Of any other door.
That first step might be just a little...
Yeah, thanks for the warning, Jenkins.
This is Boston.
You moved the annex to Boston?
No, just the door.
Does no one listen?
It's an einstein-rosen bridge.
It's a wormhole.
The back door is on the east coast...
And the front door is still on the west coast.
Wait, we can go anywhere we want in the world?
Absolutely anywhere, that has a door.
Still working out the kinks.
You know, it doesn't stay open very long.
And it's not the most accurate thing.
And most frankly, getting to the right city is a win...
Any door?
Like, say, a bank vault door?
I'm asking for a mate.
We do this, you do what I say, when I say.
Clear?
Good luck.
What?
Nothing.
Go away.
I'm working.
Eight of our interns have gone missing.
Golden axe foods is one of the oldest companies in the world.
Over the decades, the centuries,
No matter war, famine, plague, golden axe
Always prevails and we've done so through integrity.
So the idea of any wrongdoing is...
Well, I for one am shocked.
Franklin, did you know about this?
I'm also shocked.
And your interest in this, miss?
Colonel Baird, nato counter-terrorism.
I am less shocked.
You think our interns were terrorists?
You're a big agribusiness.
You have access to the food supply.
We prefer not to take any chances.
Miss Willis?
The Tokyo office is on the line.
Not now, Jennie.
Well, as CEO of golden axe, I am, of course,
Deeply concerned about this chain of events.
But I don't know how much more I can tell you.
We throughput interns pretty quickly here.
Most don't have the skills to compete.
You can imagine what it's like to deal with utter amateurs.
You know, why don't you speak to Human Resources?
I'm sure they have the records of the people you're looking for.
Would you show them the way?
Mr. Franklin, Tokyo really needs to confirm the shipping price.
Hai.
They know something.
How do you know they know something?
Eight missing interns, they should've buried us in lawyers,
Not danced us straight in to meet Karen Willis, the CEO.
She wanted to size us up.
Find out what we know.
So they know now that we know something but do we now know
They know something more than just knowing we know something?
I betcha whatever they're about to show us in hr is gonna be faked up.
You know, just for show.
The originals might be on the main server,
If I can find the server room.
We just passed it.
Back there.
Yeah, air seals for climate control.
Most security I've seen on this floor.
Good, you three go to HR.
If she wants to put on a show, you're the audience.
I'm gonna break into the server room.
Ezekiel Jones, world-class thief.
Why am I playing audience and you're a burglar?
Because I want the three of you together, safe,
In a place that is very boring.
What I say, when I say it.
Excuse me?
Restroom?
Down the hall.
Go ahead.
I'll catch up.
Please.
I'll wait for your friend.
Room zero-fourteen.
Go left, left, then right.
We should have warned Baird that guy was going back after her.
Hey, she's the one who sent us on a snipe hunt.
Let her sweat a little.
What did he say?
Left, left and right?
You are not servers.
Look at this.
Looks like Greek frescoes.
This is late Helladic, I think.
Now why would these be down here in the basement?
More like, sub-basement.
Did we down a little and nobody noticed?
Guys, can we just hurry up and find human resources?
This lighting is giving me a headache.
Are you sure it's not your brain grape about to pop?
Okay, new rule.
How about we not refer to the tumor that
Will one day kill me as a brain grape?
Here we go.
And I was worried we were getting lost.
We're not in human resources.
Go, go.
Baird!
I'm texting you some pictures.
I found something real weird.
Did you?
We found something weird too!
I found a room full of really old art.
That is weird.
We found a room full of human skulls!
What do you mean human skulls?
How many ways can I mean human skulls?
Left, to left and right, guys.
This doesn't make any sense.
Wait a minute, this is not late Helladic.
This is Minoan.
There's barely any complete Minoan art known to exist.
Minoan.
Why do I know that name?
Greek mythology.
Theseus and the Minotaur.
Big monster, head of a bull.
Inescapable labyrinth.
Theseus had a big ball of thread,
Used it so he wouldn't get lost...
This place is kind of labyrinth-y.
And I'm looking at a really old ball of thread.
Well, that's clearly stupid.
There is no way under a skyscraper
We are in a labyrinth.
Okay, maybe we are in a labyrinth.
Let's go!
Yes.
Jenkins, quick question.
Any chance someone could have recreated
The Minotaur's labyrinth in a skyscraper in Boston?
Goodness, no.
Don't be absurd.
Even assuming that you had enough power,
You would need a, just a magnificent collection
Of ancient Minoan artifacts to focus it.
The Librarians are in the labyrinth.
I sent them there alone.
Why?
To keep them safe.
That was a very bad idea.
Although I will say I'm impressed.
We've had guardians lose Librarians in the past of course.
But never three in one day.
It'll be quite some time before anyone beats that.
So how do we get them out?
We don't.
It's a labyrinth.
The whole point is you can't get out.
Well, what about your magic back door?
Can't you open that inside the labyrinth?
Colonel, I told you, I was lucky we found Boston.
I, I can't pinpoint them in a maze.
Okay, so what about that other thing you said,
Symbolic whose-ee-flopper, whatchamacallit, thingamajiggy?
The labyrinth isn't just a maze, it's a magic maze.
All right?
It exists in more than three dimensions
And you know what I seriously doubt?
Putting an extra-dimensional hole
In a multi-dimensional space is a very good idea!
That was not a request.
Guys, wait.
Something isn't...
Just give me a minute.
Wasn't it right, then right, then left?
No, no, no, no, no.
This is not the time, kid.
Okay?
We got to run because...
Do not say because the Minotaur is coming.
Because there is no Minotaur and I'll tell you why.
In your myth, what's-his-face?
Theseus.
Yeah, right.
He killed the Minotaur.
So the Minotaur is dead, and if it's dead,
He's not here.
Right?
Right?
This is wrong.
The hallway we were in before should
Cut through here, but it doesn't.
It's impossible.
Hey, guys, I think we should go this way.
This is great.
Stuck in a magic maze with two of the least reliable people I know.
Wait, least reliable?
You have been on my case non-stop.
Why am I unreliable?
Not now, all right?
We got to move.
I know.
I betrayed you that first time, so...
Not now.
I was scared.
I have a death sentence inside my head
And they offered me a cure, so what was I supposed to do?
Not sell us out.
So self-righteous.
Look at me and all I've sacrificed;
I'm such a good boy.
Well, I take my responsibility seriously...
Shh.
You made your bed.
I didn't get a choice in mine.
So you don't get to judge me for a...
There's a pattern.
Pattern, pattern.
Pattern, pattern.
Circles inside squares inside triangles.
That's why I have the headache.
My brain knew that we were in a maze before we even really noticed it ourselves.
I can see it.
Kind of.
Can you kind of get us out of here?
Oy!
Whatever issues you two are having, save it.
I saw we follow the brain grape.
We are not calling it a brain grape.
Follow the brain grape.
This way.
Where next?
Kind of more guessing than knowing, but I guess this way.
One short, one long, two short.
What?
Morse code?
That's an I. For Librarians?
It's Baird.
Let's go.
Anyone else worried the monster heard those gunshots, too?
I'm hoping we find Baird first.
Human resources.
So safe.
So boring.
Go!
We have to hold out as long as we can!
Well, I'll be damned.
I did not think that would work with a cabinet door.
Go, go!
Symbolic representation of you in the labyrinth.
That's a trick I won't be trying any time soon again.
So.
First time out.
How'd it go?
As far as we can tell, ma'am,
She doesn't see to have disturbed anything.
Why was she in here?
She can't know what we're doing unless... no.
There's only one Librarian and he was just spotted in...?
Budapest, I think.
Expedite the timetable just in case.
Start tomorrow, with that blonde idiot at my desk.
Honestly, how hard is it to knock?
And if these people come back?
They won't.
Nobody escapes the labyrinth.
It's the thread.
The thread.
What's all this other stuff?
Magic has three parts.
Power, to change reality.
Focus to direct that change
And an effect that change in the real world.
The effect would be the labyrinth, right?
Created by the focus of the Minoan artifacts.
Mr. Stone, you have a knack for this.
But the power that holds it all together,
That's the original thread in the myth.
Millennia old.
"Millennia" means thousands of years...
Yes, thank you.
Once you take the thread out,
It would be like taking the battery out of a car.
Yes.
Crude analogy but totally accurate.
We destroy the thread and the entire multi-dimensional
Hoo-collapses in on itself with a whoosh.
All we have to do is get past that Minotaur.
Everything I have on Minotaurs.
Nasty creatures.
Hold a grudge.
I put seven rounds into the thing and it still got back up.
There are many immortal beings that can be injured but not killed.
Nicolas Flamel.
The wandering jew.
The black mask, the sources reported him killed
Many times but he always seems to pop up when needed.
If I can't kill this thing, what am I supposed to do?
Colonel, the library chose you for a reason and trust me,
It wasn't because of your ability to kill.
We're not gonna save Henry Birch.
Well, then we get him justice.
We're here to protect innocent people from out-of-control magic.
I say this qualifies.
Golden axe foods has the labyrinth in its basement.
Tell me why.
Well the myth is that the king imprisoned
The Minotaur in the labyrinth.
Every seven years he sends down 14 virgins, seven men, seven women, for sacrifice.
Good luck finding 14 virgins these days.
The Greek words for "virgin" are eitheos and parthenos,
They both literally mean unmarried man and woman.
You... it could mean youth, it could mean inexperienced...
Interns.
Okay?
So in the myth,
What did the king get for his sacrifices?
He gets power.
He gets prosperity and wealth.
"Through war, famine and plague, golden axe will always prevail".
The myth calls for fourteen sacrifices.
They're gonna kill six more people
If we don't do anything about it.
Six more people are gonna be screaming, run down by that.
At least.
I mean, this has been going on for centuries,
Who's to say they're ever going to stop?
We have to get that thread.
Have I mentioned, you know, world class thief?
Relentlessly.
So the cases themselves have some heavy-duty security.
Taser nets are built in.
Touch one of the cases without deactivating
The net and zap, 50,000 volts.
But the trick is getting back into that building,
Past that monster and tunneling underground
Is obviously out of the question...
Guys?
That's impossible.
This is exactly like the frescoes that were in the...
We're back in the labyrinth.
Okay, so I've got a phone signal, but no gps.
How is this happening?
Sorry, could you tell me where the nearest subway is?
Sure.
Thanks.
Yes?
Jenkins, quick question.
We're on the street outside the annex but we seem to be back in the labyrinth.
So, annoying or cryptic, those are your two speeds?
It's possible the labyrinth isn't just a place,
It is a lingering effect.
Like a curse?
Yes.
The labyrinth won't let you out.
It's confusing your senses, warping space around you.
It doesn't matter where you go, you'll get lost,
Eventually wandering back into its clutches.
Fascinating.
So how do we find the thread and shut down the maze
If we're stuck in the maze?
If you say "" one more time, so help me...
Colonel Baird!
Colonel Baird?
Run!
Jenkins!
The Minotaur's in the maze with us!
Get us out of here!
I told you, I cannot pull that trick off twice.
But perhaps I could use the labyrinth itself
To buy you some time.
He's right behind us!
The labyrinth confuses the senses, distorts space.
I can actually amplify the effect.
If I create a dimensional bubble
Around you so confusing even the Minotaur can't find you.
For how long?
Five minutes.
Maybe less, certainly not more.
Good luck, colonel.
And run.
Come on.
Okay, stay calm.
I've been in worse spots than this before.
Well, that strains credibility.
Stone, you take point.
Ezekiel, watch the rear, there's a high roof up there.
There isn't.
You heard what Jenkins said,
The labyrinth is just trying to confuse us.
Even it was there, we couldn't reach it.
It's not a suggestion, it's an order.
And I'm not a soldier!
You're right.
I am, but you're not.
You're Librarians.
Librarians win because of what they know.
So, what do you know?
Come on, guys, what do you know?
Theseus.
Bloke from the story.
He went into the maze and killed the Minotaur.
The Minotaur can't be killed.
Then how did he escape?
You said the Minotaur was imprisoned inside the labyrinth.
Every prison I've ever seen had a control center inside the walls.
Your man Theseus, maybe he didn't go to the center
To try and kill the Minotaur...
Maybe he went to the center to pull the plug on the maze,
Same as us.
You want to bet that maze leads back to those artifacts?
No, because I was in that artifact room, I wasn't...
Keycard.
I used that stolen keycard.
The executive keycards keep them from getting lost in the labyrinth.
We don't try to escape.
We go deeper in.
I can get us to the center.
My brain started trying to figure out the maze when I was in it before.
I've seen, experienced more of it now.
I bet I can get us through.
Okay, Cassandra's our thread.
Follow her.
Outrun the Minotaur,
Steal the power source for the maze, shut it down.
Librarians, we have a plan.
Imagine a building where every floor
Has a different layout.
And sometimes, when you walk around,
You move between floors without even knowing it.
So from your perspective, the layout looks different
But if you know what floor you're on,
It makes perfect sense.
Sure.
Duh.
I just need to know how many floors are in the building.
That number, all the core geometry is gonna be based on that.
- Without it...
- It should be seven.
Seven's the number.
The myth is built on seven.
Seven male victims.
Seven female, sacrificed every seven years.
Seven.
Seven is violet.
Three seven-dimensional polytypes:
Seven simplex, seven-cube and the seven-orthoplex.
There aren't enough vertices.
It's a demihepteract!
Gotcha!
Okay.
Is this the way in?
It's the way back to the annex.
Probably.
Maybe.
Where are you going?
We have to split up.
And you don't want to be in the labyrinth when it goes poof.
We're staying together.
I'm not letting you out of my sight again.
If we stick together he's got us.
This doesn't work unless someone distracts mister stompy.
Fine, I'll distract him.
On your own, you don't stand a chance.
And if he kills you, then he's gonna chase us down.
So we send these two in alone?
Cassandra to find the center, me to grab the thread.
It's the only way.
You can't protect us all.
How much time do you need?
Ten minutes to find the center.
Five to crack the case holding the thread.
15 minutes.
Check.
Don't jump the gun.
Don't lose the bull.
And don't stray off the path.
Good hunting.
Remember, we do this...
I know... smarter, not harder.
I got it.
Yo!
Come on, boy.
Okay, which way to the center?
That way.
No, wait.
That way.
You sure?
Back off, I'm doing math.
That way.
He's gaining on us.
Seven times seven is forty-nine.
Forty-nine times seven is three-forty-three.
Wait.
It's here.
It's right here.
Good for math.
This way!
We're not gonna make it.
What are you doing?
I'll buy you as much time as I can.
- What?
- Go!
No!
Baird!
Seven points on a heptagon...
Seven is a mersenne prime,
Two to the third minus one equals seven...
I can't do it.
No, I can't do it.
Seven dimensions is...
it's too much.
I can't.
Seven's nothing.
Leaves you with what, three fingers?
I once stole a gun out of a cop's hand using three fingers.
Stone was right.
You can't trust me.
I'll let everyone down.
If I was in your shoes, with that thing
Growing in my head,
I'd have sold everybody out for a cure, too.
The only difference is, I would have stuck the landing.
Let Flynn die.
Let the serpent brotherhood win.
Let the world burn.
But you didn't.
Yeah, you screwed people over but you didn't let them down.
I can't hold it though, it's too much.
So close your eyes.
Focus on your other senses.
My other senses and I don't get along so well.
Brain grape.
So I'll be your other senses.
Shut your eyes and see the map inside your head.
I'll lead you through.
You really trust me to do that?
I'm the thief that bails on everybody.
Pretty sure you're the one trusting me.
Okay.
We need to go down and to the left.
That's good.
Good.
Good.
Look at that.
Smarter and harder.
You did it.
We made it.
You okay?
Yeah.
Go.
I just need to count down from seven.
Seven is violet, six is indigo, five is blue...
Shut down the tasers, pop the case, grab the thread.
Five minutes is all we need.
You don't have it.
Who are you?
We're the Librarians.
We accept your surrender.
There's only one Librarian and you are not him.
But something has changed.
There's more magic in the world, more power to our sacrifices.
Golden axe, in one form or another has been
Sacrificing innocents to the labyrinth for 3,000 years
And we have never seen a stock bump like we got
Off our last offering.
We made it.
Is it still behind us?
Assume yes.
You are the first modern people to reach the center.
No intern has ever managed that.
Kids today.
There's no initiative!
You are a more old-fashioned,
Ritual sacrifice kind of person?
I single-handedly modernized the process.
I said, "let's amortize".
Spread the sacrifices out over the year instead of doing them all at once.
Increases the overhead but the decrease in visibility
Means your return on investment is even higher on a per-intern basis.
You got to spend money to make money.
I get it.
Let's say we all part as friends...
You know, I'm not sure if shooting you here
Counts towards our fourteen
Or if the Minotaur has to make the kill itself.
I guess I'll find out tomorrow when I see the market returns.
Only two of you?
I never thought they were cut out for...
Is that thing trying to get into my annex?
You led that back to my...?
Not now!
Hey!
This is delicate.
That's good, too.
Come on, then.
Give me that thread.
If you drop it, we're all doomed.
Any ideas?
Hey, let's be professional.
I have the resources.
You obviously have the talent.
Name your price.
Double if you take it in stock options.
Jenkins.
He said that magic depends on symbols.
What better symbol of a labyrinth than
A straight line rapped around and around and around itself?
Here.
Catch!
The labyrinth!
The labyrinth!
I believe I said with a "whoosh".
Cassandra, Jones!
Got it.
We made it.
Yeah.
You did.
This time, you did.
You should have seen her.
No hiding.
Took the fight right to the big bad.
And Ezekiel.
He did kind of save the day by bailing on me.
I told you.
I don't do punchy.
Well done.
May I?
Now without this to serve as a power source,
The labyrinth should shrivel up and wink out of existence.
Eventually.
We ought to lock that up.
Yes.
Well, we don't have the facilities
Of the main library, but I'll think of something.
What about Willis?
I mean, I know we stopped her, but shouldn't she go to jail
Or something for what she did to Henry Birch and the others?
I wouldn't worry about Ms. Willis.
She imprisoned a Minotaur.
Nasty creatures.
Hold a grudge.
Those people do not know who they're messing with.
Librarians or not, we will find them,
Destroy them and get back what we...
Look, things got a little heated in there...
Don't worry about it.
I'm not.
Kind of worried about what you said to me.
You know, if we're gonna work together,
You're gonna need to trust...
Nobody knows.
Nobody back home knows about this.
I have kept it a secret
For twenty years.
Why would you hide that?
You're a genius, you know about culture
And art and beautiful things.
I told you before, family ain't ever easy.
For me...
You don't... no.
That's enough for now.
The point is, I'm used to keeping my life separated.
All right?
My family, my friends, I love 'em.
I like 'em.
No problem working right along side of them.
Any of them.
But I don't trust a single one of 'em to tell them...
I mean, can you imagine meeting Flynn,
Meeting you,
Meeting Baird
And the thief.
Finding out about this library.
Finding people I could trust.
Well, you know how that felt?
I do.
I really do.
And then to have it broken?
I like you, Cassie.
There's no way around it, I just do.
But I trusted you and,
I learned my lesson.
Not, it's not...
Look, it always ends bad so...
Old way's best.
So, end of day, not too bad for a first time out, was it?
You did okay.
I could do better.
I spent my entire adult life in the military.
Everybody fits into a box.
You don't.
You're not assets to be protected,
You're not soldiers I can order around.
I don't know what you are.
Well, maybe the term you're looking for is "partners".
Fair enough.
Can you go back to the part where you said we were awesome?
I said you did okay.
Yeah, but I'm gonna take that as "we rule."
Mostly me.
You guys were okay.
Okay?
I did math.
True.
Points for math.
Stone, though, you mostly just got beat up.
I do rule.
Help!
Somebody help me!
Somebody help me!
Help me!
Help me!
Help me!
Please!
You have to help me!
Please!
No!
No!
Help!
No!
No!
Help me!
Hey, what's that place with the great turkey panini?
Mancolo's.
No.
No, the...
Oh, um...
Castellani's.
Mmm.
Order lunch from there for the department budget meeting.
I love that panini.
Go, go, go!
Ohh!
It took me two minutes to disable all three of you.
Stone, you've got an IQ of 190.
You should know you can't solve everything with brute force alone.
It's worked so far.
Fight smarter, not harder.
Still, at least you can fight.
Ezekiel bailed on his team.
These are the hands of a world-class thief.
- I don't do punchy.
- And Cassandra hid... badly.
I am here to do science and math and occasionally hallucinate.
You're just not being fair.
You think I'm not fair, wait until you meet the bad guys, which is why we'll run drills again tomorrow and every day until I'm sure I can take you out into the field with even a chance of you coming back in one piece.
Oh, how substandard were they?
Good pep talk, Jenkins.
While you were out, a new page appeared in the clipping book.
- Looks fascinating.
- No!
Not yet!
Well, this is crazy.
Every day, a new page shows up of weird newspaper clippings in this book.
And every day, you tell us to ignore it.
We've hardly opened it since the day Flynn left.
Because you're not ready.
Flynn told us we were supposed to help people.
Yeah.
Ezekiel's right.
Flynn gave us a job.
We're supposed to be checking out the... weird...
Not sit around here.
Ezekiel's right.
I said that.
Jenkins, stay out...
Marvelous, isn't it?
I told you, this is where I do my research.
Judson always insists that we just lock the artifacts away.
But I experiment on them, study them, improve them.
Ha.
It's hard enough to rein them in without you dangling that clippings book in front of them.
Why rein them?
You've got to put them in the field sooner or later.
I've gone into the field with experienced soldiers with a good plan, good Intel, and still come home with nothing but dog tags.
I'm talking soldiers with training who've seen combat.
These three...
I promised Flynn I'd keep them alive.
They're not even close to ready.
We're doing this, right?
Hell yeah, we are.
Let's go.
I appreciate you wanting to keep them out of harm's way, but librarians exist to keep magic out of the wrong hands.
Their job is to be in harm's way.
I can't protect three of them at once and they can't take care of themselves, not without a lot more training.
We used to put librarians in the field
- with no training at all.
- Oh, yeah?
And how many came back?
The best ones.
- I said...
- Henry Birch, 21.
He was on a full scholarship in chemical engineering at Boston university.
He went missing two days ago.
Seven other clippings, all missing people disappeared this year.
- That many, the police are on it.
- Nope.
The victims are from all around the country.
The only reason to suspect they're connected is that
- they all showed up in our magic book.
- That's eight people gone.
Maybe dead.
We don't...
I mean, you know?
And how many more are gonna go missing before we step in?
What if he's still alive?
What if we have a chance to save Henry Birch and we don't?
And you're willing to risk your lives for him?
I won't risk my life.
But...
I assume I can outrun anything, so I'm in.
Fine.
But we're going in with a plan.
I want full breakdowns on the missing, backgrounds on their work places, magical and supernatural possibilities.
Oh, God.
What have I done?
Even though the victims were from all over, they all disappeared in Boston.
Any connection beyond the city?
Yes.
Golden Axe foods.
They all worked... and this was tricky... some of them under subsidiaries, some under shell companies,
Henry Birch was for his scholarship, but... in conclusion, they were all interns at Golden Axe foods.
Yeah.
I'm familiar with the logo.
They were all over the farms in my hometown.
And they sell, like, engineered seeds and stuff.
It's huge.
I've scouted the security.
Run-of-the-mill guards, boring alarms.
When do we break in?
We don't break in.
We go in.
We ask questions.
No picking fights.
What... what... what are you doing?
Sending you to Boston.
I present to you...
The back door.
Yeah, that's the broom closet.
Ah, no... it is a door behind which presently exists the broom closet.
Mr. Stone, hook those up.
Put them here.
You see, magic works on similarities.
Uh, a symbolic resonance.
Yes.
Uh, a voodoo doll is symbolic of a person.
And lead can be transformed into gold because it is already similar.
So, with a little...
Magic...
That broom-closet door can become a symbolic representation of any other door.
Ohh!
Ow.
Uh, s... uh, that first step might be just a little...
Hey, yeah, thanks for the warning, Jenkins.
Th-this is Boston.
You moved the annex to Boston?
No.
Just the door.
Does no one listen?
It's an Einstein-Rosen bridge.
It's a wormhole.
The back door's on the east coast...
And the front door...
Is still on the west coast.
Wait, wait.
We can go anywhere we want in the world?
Absolutely anywhere that has a door.
Still working out the kinks.
You know, it doesn't stay open very long and it's not the most accurate thing.
Well, frankly, getting the right city is a win.
Any door?
Like, say...
A bank-vault door?
I'm asking for a mate.
We do this, you do what I say, when I say.
Clear?
- Good luck.
- What?
Nothing.
Go away.
I'm working.
Eight of our interns have gone missing.
Golden Axe foods is one of the oldest companies in the world.
Over the decades... the... centuries, no matter war, famine, plague,
Golden Axe always prevails.
And we've done so through integrity.
So the idea of any wrongdoing is...
Well, I, for one, am shocked.
Franklin, did you know about this?
I'm also shocked.
And your interest in this, Miss...
Colonel Baird, NATO Counterterrorism.
I am less shocked.
You think our interns were terrorists?
You're big agribusiness.
You have access to the food supply.
We prefer not to take any chances.
Miss Willis?
The Tokyo office is on the line.
Not now, Jennie.
Well, as C.E.O. of Golden Axe,
I am, of course, deeply concerned about this chain of events.
But I don't know how much more I can tell you.
We throughput interns pretty quickly here.
Most don't have the skills to compete.
You know, why don't you speak to Human Resources?
I'm sure they have the records of the people you're looking for.
Would you show them the way?
Mr. Franklin, Tokyo really needs to confirm
- the shipping price.
- Hai?
- They know something.
- How do you know they know something?
Eight missing interns, they should have buried us in lawyers, not danced us straight in to meet Karen Willis, the C.E.O.
She wanted to size us up, find out what we know.
So, they now know that we know something?
But do we now know that they know something more
- than just knowing we know something?
- I'll bet you whatever they're about to show us in the H.R.
Is gonna be faked up, you know, just for show.
The originals might be on the main server if I can find the server room.
We just passed it back there.
Yeah, air seals for climate control, most security I've seen on this floor.
Good.
You three go to H.R.
If she wants to put on a show, you're the audience.
I'm gonna break into the server room.
Uh, Ezekiel Jones, world-class thief.
Why am I playing audience and you're burglar?
Because I want the three of you together, safe, in a place that is very boring.
What I say, when I say it.
Excuse me?
Restroom?
Down the hall.
Go ahead.
I'll catch up.
Hai.
Domo.
Please.
I'll wait for your friend.
Room 014.
Go left, left, then right.
We should have warned Baird that guy was going back after her.
Hey, she's the one who sends us on a snipe hunt.
Let her sweat a little.
What did he say, a left, a left, and a right?
You are not servers.
Look at this.
Looks like Greek frescos.
This is late Helladic, I think.
Now, why would these be down here in the basement?
More like subbasement.
Did we go down a level and nobody noticed?
Guys, could we just hurry up and find Human Resources?
This lighting is giving me a headache.
Are you sure it's not your brain grape about to pop?
Okay, new rule... how about we not refer to
- the tumor that will one day kill me as a "brain grape"?
- Ah.
Here we go.
And I was worried we were getting lost.
You are not Human Resources.
Go.
Go.
Baird!
I'm texting you some pictures.
I found something real weird.
Oh, did you?
We found something weird, too.
I found a room full of really old art.
That is weird.
We found a room full of human skulls!
What do you mean, human skulls?
How many ways can I mean "human skulls"?
Left, then left, then right guys.
- This doesn't make any sense.
- Wait a minute.
This is not late Helladic.
This is Minoan.
There's barely any complete Minoan art known to exist.
Minoan.
Why do I know that name?
Greek mythology.
Theseus and the Minotaur.
Big monster.
Head of a bull, inescapable labyrinth.
Theseus had a big ball of thread.
He used it so he wouldn't get lost.
This place is... kind of labyrinth-y.
And I'm looking at a really old ball of thread.
Well, that's clearly stupid.
There is no way, under a skyscraper, we're in a labyrinth.
Oh!
Okay.
Maybe we are in a labyrinth.
Let's go.
Yes?
Jenkins, quick question.
Any chance someone could have re-created the Minotaur's labyrinth in a skyscraper in Boston?
Goodness, no.
Don't be absurd.
Even assuming you had enough power, you would need a magnificent collection of ancient Minoan artifacts to focus it.
The Librarians are in the labyrinth.
I sent them there alone.
Why?
To keep them safe.
That was a very bad idea.
Uh, although I will say I'm impressed.
We've had guardians lose Librarians in the past, of course, but never three in one day.
It will be quite some time before anyone beats that.
So how do we get them out?
You don't.
It's a labyrinth.
The whole point is you can't get out.
Well, what about your magic back door?
Can't you open that inside the labyrinth?
Colonel, I told you, I was lucky we found Boston.
I-I can't pinpoint them in the maze.
Okay, so what about that other thing you said, symbolic whosey-flopper whatchamacallit thingamajigy?
The labyrinth isn't just a maze.
It's a magic maze, all right?
It exists in more than three dimensions.
And you know what I seriously doubt?
Putting an extra-dimensional hole in a multi-dimensional space is a very good idea.
That was not a request.
Guys, wait.
Something isn't...
Mm.
Just give me a minute.
No, no, no, no, no, no.
This is not the time, kid, okay?
- We got to run because...
- No!
No, no, no, no.
Do not say "because the Minotaur is coming."
Because there is no Minotaur, and I'll tell you why.
In your myth, uh, what's-his-face?
Theseus!
Yeah, right.
He killed the Minotaur.
So the Minotaur is dead.
And if he's dead, he's not here.
Right?
Right?
Right?
Ugh.
This is wrong.
The hallway we were in before should cut through here.
But it doesn't.
I-it's impossible.
Wait, guys.
I think we should go this way.
That's great.
I'm stuck in a magic maze with two of the least reliable people I know.
Wait.
Least reliable?
You know what?
You have been on my case nonstop.
Why am I unreliable?
Not now, all right?
We got to move.
I know.
I betrayed you that first time, so...
Not now.
Hey.
I was scared.
I have a death sentence inside my head and they offered me a cure, so what was I supposed to do?
Not sell us out.
So self-righteous.
"Look at me and all I've sacrificed.
I'm such a good boy."
Well, I take my responsibilities seriously.
- Shh!
- And you made your bed.
I didn't get a choice in mine.
So you don't get to judge me for...
There's a pattern.
Pattern, pattern.
Pattern, pattern.
Circles insides of squares inside of triangles.
That's why I have the headache.
My brain knew that we were in a maze before we even realized it ourselves.
I can see it.
Kind of.
Can you kind of get us out of here?
Oi!
Whatever issues you two are having, save it.
I say we follow the brain grape.
We are not calling it a brain grape!
Follow the brain grape.
This way.
Ha!
- Where next?
- Kind of more guessing than knowing, but...
I guess this way.
One short, one long, two short.
What, Morse code?
It's an "L" For "Librarians"?
It's Baird.
Let's go.
Anyone else worried that the monster heard
- those gunshots, too?
- I'm hoping we find Baird first.
Human resources... so safe, so boring.
Go on.
Come on.
Do it, do it.
Ooh!
We have to hold out as long as we can!
Well, I'll be damned.
I did not think that would work with a cabinet door.
Go!
Go!
Uh, a symbolic representation of you in the labyrinth.
That's a trick I won't be trying anytime soon again.
So...
First time out.
How did it go?
As far as we can tell, ma'am, she doesn't seem
- to have disturbed anything.
- Why was she in here?
She can't know what we're doing unless...
No, there's only one Librarian,
- and he was just spotted in...
- Budapest, I think.
Expedite the time table just in case.
Start tomorrow with that blonde idiot at my desk.
Honestly, how hard is it to knock?
And if these people come back?
They won't.
Nobody escapes the labyrinth.
It's the thread.
The thread?
There's all this other stuff.
Magic has three parts...
power to change reality, focus to direct that change, and an effect, that change in the real world.
The effect would be the labyrinth, right?
Mm-hmm.
Created by the focus of the Minoan artifacts.
Mr. Stone, you have a knack for this.
But the power that holds it all together, that's the original thread in the myth, millennia old.
- Millennia means thousands of years.
- Yes, thank you.
If you take the thread out, it would be like taking the battery out of a car.
Yes.
Crude analogy, but totally accurate.
We destroy the thread, and the entire multi-dimensional hoo-ha collapses in on itself with a whoosh.
All we have to do is get past that Minotaur.
Yeah.
Everything I have on minotaurs.
Nasty creatures, hold a grudge.
I put seven rounds into the thing, and it still got back up.
There are many immortal beings that can be injured but not killed.
Nicholas Flamel, the wandering Jew, the black mask.
Sources reported him killed many times, but he always seems to pop up when needed.
If I can't kill this thing, what am I supposed to do?
Colonel, the library chose you for a reason.
And, trust me, it wasn't because of your ability to kill.
We're not gonna save Henry Birch.
Well, then, we get him justice.
We're here to protect innocent people from out-of-control magic.
I say this qualifies.
Golden Axe Foods has the labyrinth in its basement.
Tell me why.
Well, the myth is that the King imprisoned the Minotaur in the labyrinth.
Every 7 years, he sends down 14 virgins... seven men, seven women... for a sacrifice.
Good luck finding 14 virgins these days.
The Greek words for "virgin" are eitheos and parthenos.
They both literally mean unmarried man and woman.
It could mean youth, it could mean inexperience.
Interns.
Okay.
So, in the myth, what did the King get for his sacrifices?
He gets power.
He gets prosperity and wealth.
"Through war, famine, plague, Golden Axe will always prevail."
The myth calls for 14 sacrifices.
They're gonna kill six more people if we don't do anything about it.
Six more people are gonna be screaming, run down by that.
At least.
I mean, this has been going on for centuries.
Who's to say they're ever gonna stop?
We have to get that thread.
Have I mentioned you know a world-class thief?
Relentlessly.
So, the cases themselves have some heavy-duty security.
Paulco taser nets are built-in.
Touch one of the cases without deactivating the nets, and, zap, 50,000 volts.
But the trick is getting back into that building, past that monster.
And tunneling underground is obviously out of the question.
Guys.
That's impossible.
This is exactly like the frescos that were in the...
We're back in the labyrinth.
Okay.
So, I've got a phone signal but no GPS.
How is this happening?
Sorry.
Could you tell me where the nearest subway is?
Sure... take a raft at Boybridge Street, go four blocks down, then go late at mart.
Oh, and here in Bossville, we call it the Q.
Thanks.
Yes?
Jenkins, quick question.
We're on the street outside the annex but we seem to be back in the labyrinth.
Huh.
So...
Annoying or cryptic, those are your two speeds, huh?
It's possible the labyrinth isn't just a place.
It... is a lingering effect.
- Like a curse?
- Yes.
The labyrinth won't let you out.
It's confusing your senses, warping space around you.
It doesn't matter where you go, you'll get lost, eventually wandering back into its clutches.
Fascinating.
So, how do we find the thread and shut down the maze if we're stuck in the maze?
Huh.
If you say "huh" one more time, so help me...
Colonel Baird.
Colonel Baird?
!
Run!
Jenkins, the Minotaur's in the maze with us.
- Get us out of here!
- I told you,
I cannot pull that trick off twice.
Um...
But...
Perhaps I could use the labyrinth itself to buy you some time.
He's right behind us!
The labyrinth, well, it confuses senses, distorts space.
I can actually amplify that effect, create a-a dimensional bubble around you, so confusing even the Minotaur can't find you.
For how long?
Uh, five minutes.
Maybe less.
Certainly not more.
Uh, good luck, Colonel.
Oh, and run.
Come on.
Okay.
Stay calm.
I've been in worse spots than this before.
Well, that strains credibility.
- Stone, you take point.
- All right.
Ezekiel, watch the rear.
- And there's a high roof up there.
- There isn't.
You heard what Jenkins said.
The labyrinth is just trying to confuse us.
Even if it was there, we couldn't reach it.
It's not a suggestion.
It's an order.
And I'm not a soldier.
You're right.
I am, but you're not.
You're librarians.
Librarians win because of what they know.
So, what do you know?
Come on, guys.
What do you know?
Uh, Theseus, bloke from the story, he went into the maze and killed the Minotaur.
A Minotaur can't be killed.
Well, then, how did he escape?
You said the Minotaur was imprisoned inside the labyrinth.
Every prison I've ever seen had a control center inside the walls.
Your man Theseus, maybe he didn't go to the center to try and kill the Minotaur.
Maybe he went to the center to pull the plug on the maze,
- same as us.
- What do you want to bet that maze leads back to those artifacts?
No, 'cause I was in that artifacts room and I wasn't... key card.
I used that stolen key card.
The executive key cards keep them from getting lost in the labyrinth.
We don't try to escape.
We go deeper in.
I can get us to the center.
My brain started trying to figure out the maze when I was in it before.
I've seen, experienced more of it now.
I bet I can get us through.
Okay.
Cassandra's our thread.
Follow her.
Outrun the Minotaur, steal the power source for the maze, shut it down.
Librarians, we have a plan.
The labyrinth.
Imagine a building where every floor has a different layout.
Sometimes, when you walk around, you move between floors without even knowing it.
So, from your perspective, the layout looks different.
But if you know what floor you're on,
- it makes perfect sense.
- Sure.
Duh.
Just need to know how many floors are in the building.
That number, all the core geometry's gonna be based on that.
Without it...
It's gonna be seven.
Seven's the number.
The myth is built on seven.
Seven male victims, seven female, sacrificed every seven years.
Seven.
Seven is violet.
Three seven-dimensional polytypes.
Seven-simplex, seven-cube, seven-orthoplex.
There aren't enough vertices.
It's a demihepteract.
Gotcha.
Okay.
Is this the way in?
It's the way back to the annex.
Probably.
Maybe.
Whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Where are you going?
We have to split up, and you don't want to be
- in the labyrinth when it goes poof.
- We're staying together.
I'm not letting you out of my sight again.
If we stick together, he's got us.
This doesn't work unless someone distracts Mr. Stompy.
Fine.
I'll distract him.
On your own, you don't stand a chance.
And if he kills you, then he's gonna chase us down.
So we send these two in alone?
Oh, Cassandra to find the center, me to grab the thread.
It's the only way.
You can't protect us all.
How much time do you need?
10 minutes to find the center.
Five to crack the case holding the thread.
15 minutes, check.
- Don't jump the gun.
- Don't lose the bull.
And don't stray off the path.
Good hunting.
Remember, we do this...
I know.
Smarter, not harder.
I got it.
Yo!
Come on, boy.
He's gaining on us.
7 times 7 is 49. 49 times 7 is 343.
Wait.
It's here.
It's right here.
Good for math.
This way!
We're not gonna make it.
What are you doing?
I'll buy you as much time as I can.
- What?
- Go!
No!
Baird!
Seven points on a heptagon.
Seven is a mersenne prime.
Two to the third minus one equals seven.
I...
I can't do it.
No, I can't do it.
Seven dimensions.
It's... it's too much.
I can't.
- Seven's nothing.
- Mm-hmm.
Leaves you with, what, three fingers?
I once stole a gun out of a cop's hand using three fingers.
Stone was right.
You can't trust me.
I let everyone down.
If I was in your shoes, with that thing growing in my head,
I'd have sold everybody out for a cure, too.
The only difference is, I would have stuck the landing, let Flynn die, let the Serpent Brotherhood win, let the world burn.
But you didn't.
Yeah, you screwed people over, but you didn't let them down.
I just can't hold it, though.
It's too much.
So, close your eyes.
Focus on your other senses.
My other senses and I don't get along so well.
Brain grape.
So I'll be your other senses.
Shut your eyes and see the map inside your head.
I'll lead you through.
You really trust me to do that?
I'm the thief that bails on everybody.
Pretty sure you're the one trusting me.
Okay.
We need to go down and to the left.
That's good.
Good.
Good.
Ohh!
Look at that... smarter and harder.
You did it.
We made it.
Oh.
- You okay?
- Yeah.
Go.
I just need to count down from seven.
Seven is violet.
Six is indigo.
Five is blue.
Shut down the tasers, pop the case,
- and grab the thread.
- Four...
Five minutes is all we need.
You don't have it.
Who are you?
We're the Librarians.
We accept your surrender.
There's only one Librarian, and you are not him.
But something has changed.
There's more magic in the world, more power to our sacrifices.
Golden Axe, in one form or another, has been sacrificing innocents to the labyrinth for 3,000 years and we have never seen a stock bump like we got off our last offering.
We made it.
Is he still behind us?
Assume yes.
You are the first modern people to reach the center.
No intern has ever managed that.
Kids today, there's no initiative.
You're a more old-fashioned, ritual-sacrifice kind of person.
I single-handedly modernized the process.
I said, "let's amortize."
Spread the sacrifices out over the year instead of doing them all at once.
Increases the overhead, but the decrease in visibility means the return on investment is even higher on a per-intern basis.
Hey, you got to spend money to make money.
I get it.
Let's say we all part as friends.
You know, I'm not sure if shooting you here counts towards our 14 or if the Minotaur has to make the kill itself.
I guess I'll find out tomorrow when I see the market returns.
Oh!
Huh.
Only two of you.
Frankly, I never thought that they were cut out for...
That thing is trying to get into my annex?
You led that back here?
Not now!
Aah!
Oh!
Hey!
This is delicate.
That's good, too.
Come on, then.
Give me that thread.
If you drop it, we're all doomed.
Uh, any ideas?
Jenkins.
He said that magic depends on symbols.
What better symbol of our labyrinth than a straight line wrapped around and around and around itself?
Here, catch.
No!
The labyrinth.
The labyrinth!
I believe I said, "with a whoosh!"
Cassandra.
Jones.
Got it.
Ha.
Whoa!
Come on.
We made it.
Yeah.
You did.
This time, you did.
Okay.
Should have seen her.
No hiding, took the fight right to the big bad.
And Ezekiel, I mean, he did kind of save the day by bailing on me.
Told you.
I don't do punchy.
Well done.
May I?
Now, without this to serve as a power source, the labyrinth should shrivel up and wink out of existence, eventually.
We ought to lock that up.
Yes, well, we don't have the facilities of the main library, but I'll think of something.
What about Willis?
I mean, I know we stopped her, but shouldn't she go to jail or something for what she did to Henry Birch and the others?
I wouldn't worry about Ms. Willis.
She imprisoned a Minotaur... nasty creatures.
Hold a grudge.
Those people do not know who they're messing with.
Librarians or not, we will find them, destroy them, and get back what we have...
Hey.
Look, um, things got a little heated in there.
Don't worry about it.
I'm not.
I'm kind of worried about what you said to me.
You know, if we're gonna work together,
- you're gonna need to trust...
- Nobody knows.
Nobody back home knows about this.
I have kept it a secret... for 20 years.
Why would you hide that?
You're a genius.
You know about culture and art and beautiful things.
I told you before.
Family ain't ever easy.
You don't... no.
That's enough for now.
Look... the point is,
I'm used to keeping my life separated, all right?
My family, my friends, I like 'em.
No problem.
Work right alongside 'em, any of 'em.
But I don't trust a single one of them...
To tell m...
I like you, Cassie.
There's no way around it.
I just do.
But I trusted you, and, uh...
I learned my lesson.
Um, not... it's not...
look.
It always ends bad.
So...
Old way's best.
So, end of day, not too bad for a first time out, was it?
You did okay.
I...
I could do better.
I spent my entire adult life in the military.
Everybody fits into a box.
You don't.
You're not assets to be protected.
You're not soldiers I can order around.
I don't know what you are.
Well, maybe the term you're looking for is "partners."
Fair enough.
Can you go back to the part where you said we were awesome?
I said you did okay.
Yeah, but I'm gonna take that as we rule.
Mostly me.
You guys were... okay.
- "Okay"?
I did math.
- True.
- Points for math.
- Thank you.
Stone, though, you mostly just got beat up.
I do rule.
NOLAN:
Previously on Defiance...
Christie.
Mom?
Look at you.
Quentin says you're okay these days.
Is that true?
Never been better.
So I was possessed by what?
A machine?
Kaziri.
It's an ancient spaceship buried under Old Saint Louis.
An artificial intelligence pretending to be a god.
You know it wants to destroy the world, right?
Irzu wants to terraform the planet and start fresh with its chosen few.
Mordecai.
Traveling solicitor for the Irathient tribe.
Irisa showed us a picture of him.
She told us to kill him any time we saw him.
She sounded scared.
Irisa would only be scared of him if she knew he could stop her.
BERLIN:
Nolan!
(STRAINING)
What happened?
How, Nolan?
Did Irisa kill Tommy?
Yes.
The Kaziri's been activated.
It has to be Irisa.
Both keys are inside of her.
So you're saying in some past life, you and Irisa removed the keys to this ship.
Past lives, maybe our ancestors, I don't really understand it.
All I know is they scuttled the Kaziri and saved humanity.
(SIGHS) Stupid bags.
This is crazy.
Here.
Let me help.
Hey, what are you doing?
(GRUNTS)
What was that for?
A savior ought to travel light.
I never claimed to be a savior.
These...
Ow!
These visions, they could be fantasies.
I don't think so.
That ship that's controlling Irisa is scared of you, which means you are a threat.
How could I be a threat to a big, scary spaceship?
All right.
Having both the keys inside Irisa reactivated the Kaziri.
We need to separate the keys.
Separate.
Separate how?
Same way your ancestor did.
By putting one inside me?
No way!
Ah!
I'm gonna break this down for you.
You can come with me willingly or you can come strapped to the hood of my roller.
Either way, you're gonna help me stop my daughter.
Stop her?
I thought we were trying to help her.
Stop her from doing what?
(SCREECHING)
(ANIMALS ROARING)
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)
Hey, you want this?
Come get it.
Here.
Here.
(CHUCKLES)
Andina, right?
Yes, Favi Datak.
Welcome home.
Where is my wife?
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)
She is entertaining Favi Christie's mother.
If you think I'm gonna let some snooty shanje stick insect raise my family, you are crazy.
You gave up any claim to parenting when you left Defiance.
Is there a problem?
Datak.
Welcome home, my love.
You remember Pilar, Rafe's wife.
I do.
She was something of a junkie for the mood stabilizers
I would procure for her back in the old days.
That was a long time ago.
I'm much better now.
Good.
I would hate to return after a long absence to find you insulting my wife in our own home.
It might lead me to extreme actions.
No offense was taken, my love.
Pilar was merely asking if we might allow Alak and Christie to live under her roof for a while.
I'm afraid my answer disappointed her.
Well, that is a shame.
Well, while I've been gone, you two have carved out quite the niche for yourselves.
I've asked around.
You know, some people find you scary.
Hmm.
I don't, of course.
I think you're a carnival act.
Funny, little white-faced clowns.
I remember when Datak used to do card tricks for Old Earth dollars.
You, Stahma, you were a housemaid.
Do you remember that one time when our regular maid was sick?
And you came over and cleaned my toilets?
You had a gift.
As you say, that was a long time ago.
Now your beautiful home belongs to the Earth Republic, your wealthy husband is in prison, and your daughter's love is mine.
Nothing remains for you here.
Take your unfortunate son and leave our town.
Mmm.
I won't warn you twice.
You know, she blew my husband.
Just thought you should know.
She's lying, of course.
Of course.
Welcome home, hanizu.
Hmm.
E-Rep's a bit jumpy today.
New York's been radio silent all morning.
They're saying it's probably just the defective relay station, but it's got the E-Rats spooked.
Animals.
PILAR:
Have you two really considered the future?
In what way?
PILAR:
Defiance used to be a free city.
Now it's a satellite of the Earth Republic.
Dad says that's temporary.
Dad's in E-Rep jail.
Quentin, don't talk with your mouth full.
No matter what the propaganda says, the E-Rep has always been about human primacy.
Mixed species children are treated like second-class citizens.
The Votanis Collective isn't any better.
There are seven races of Votans.
They have been forced to deal with one another for thousands of years.
The Votans understand the value of assimilation.
I could show you.
Show us what?
There's a harmony collective.
South of here, maybe 300 clicks past Cedars.
Humans and Votans living side by side.
It's everything that Defiance was supposed to be.
Plenty of mixed-species children, so the baby won't feel like an outcast.
Why have I never heard of this place?
It's also a research facility.
Some of the tech they use there is classified.
For example, they breed horses there.
Horses?
Seriously?
That's impossible.
All the horses died in the plagues.
Indogene technology brought them back.
Six weeks ago, I rode a palomino mare.
Gorgeous.
Indescribable.
Do you wanna ride her?
I would love to ride a horse, but, um, I don't want to give you the wrong idea.
Our home is here.
Well, just for an overnight.
A visit.
And if you like it there, then we can talk about staying longer term.
You expect us to, what, just abandon my mother?
No.
I'm sure we could work something out.
And I assume your dad will wanna come, too, since he's moved back in.
He...
Oh, maybe your mother wanted to surprise you.
Excuse me.
Could you excuse us please?
Sure, honey.
I'll get the check.
There is no commune, is there?
You made that whole thing up.
Pay the bill, genius.
(DOOR OPENS)
Mmm.
Why is he here?
Your father and I have decided to move forward.
Together.
Mmm-hmm.
As a family.
After everything he's done?
All my misdeeds are behind us, hanya tavo.
I'm not your hanya tavo.
Let us look to the future.
One that would be incomplete without the family together.
Our family?
You mean the one you scarred and tried to drown?
Are you aware of how much pain you've caused?
Well, it's not like I dropped a whore from the top of the Gateway Arch, now is it?
You will never know my child.
Never.
Christie.
I'm sorry.
That was...
Thank you for that.
Just...
I appreciate it.
Father of the year.
Could you make this any more difficult?
I meant it as a joke.
I...
I thought it was funny.
You okay, boss?
New York's gone dark.
The relay posts are receiving dead air.
There's no chatter of any kind.
We're hoping it's a technical glitch.
What's this for?
Berlin.
What is it?
What's wrong?
Tommy's dead.
What?
How?
Irisa.
She killed him.
She wouldn't.
(SCOFFS)
Nolan says it's not her fault that she's not acting like herself, but, see, I don't believe that because Tommy knew that she was dangerous.
And he didn't want her anywhere near me.
He knew.
(SIGHS)
Sorry.
I don't know what to say.
I can't believe it.
(CELL PHONE CHIMING)
(CELL PHONE CHIMING)
And that's confirmed?
Madame Mayor.
We got the news on the trip back to New York.
Defiance was the closest town.
We're setting up a command center in Mayor Pottinger's office, and I'd like you to join.
Captain, have you been drinking?
Yes, sir.
You might want to gargle.
Amanda, you're with me.
Something's up.
Come on.
Come on.
POTTINGER:
Nope.
I don't believe it.
Only the Votanis Collective has the firepower to terraform the entire city.
Clearly, we are at war.
NOLAN:
I'm telling you, Irisa is the key.
And that arkbrain that's controlling her has no intention of stopping with New York.
For the moment, let's assume we're buying your story.
What's your plan?
We need to get this man next to Irisa.
This guy?
He can extract the tech that's controlling Irisa.
Whenever I was near her, I could feel something pulling at me.
It felt as though one of the pieces of tech wants me.
I mean, to be inside me.
That's not coming out right.
I...
Look, you know Colonel Marsh has a sealed file on Irisa.
Unseal it.
It'll back up everything I'm saying.
Classified files are kept in New York, which proves somewhat inconvenient.
MERCADO:
Actually, I believe Mr. Nolan.
Votan-controlled Belize just went dark.
The Votans would never strike their own people.
What I have trouble believing is that you knew this girl was on the watch list and you gave her a badge.
Would you care to explain that?
He did it for me.
Jeez, Niles.
Can't you just pay for sex like a normal person?
I did it because Amanda believed it was best for the town and I trust her judgment.
And I would make the same decision again and again and again.
I think you should leave.
With pleasure.
Hold it right there!
On your knees!
Now!
On your knees!
Don't move a muscle!
There's no need to fire, boys.
I'm unarmed.
I need you to take me to your commanding officer immediately.
There's an extremely powerful sentient computer that intends to destroy the planet.
That's the bad news.
Good news is I know how to kill it.
Congratulations, Doctor.
You're no longer a war criminal.
Your turn now.
You believe you can stop Irisa?
I've been inside the ship that's controlling her.
And I got my hands on some higher cognitive data crystals.
I can introduce a virus that will order the arkbrain fragments inside of Irisa to self-detonate.
Is that gonna hurt her?
Brief, intense flash of pain.
Her death will transmit the infected fragments...
Whoa.
Hold on.
...back to the Kaziri and kill it.
You are not to go anywhere near my daughter.
Terraforming will end.
Do you understand me?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought we were all serious about saving the planet, my bad.
I can do this without bloodshed.
What do you need to make this happen?
An hour in my lab.
Sir, this woman is a liar.
You can't trust her.
My plan will work.
Amanda, tell him.
If Yewll thinks that she can save her skin by killing Irisa and saving the planet, then that's exactly what she would do.
Amanda, escort the good doctor to her lab.
If she gets tricky, you can kill her.
No, hold on.
I said, hold on!
I hope you'll forgive me for this.
Forgive you for what?
Nolan needs to be locked up.
He'll never let us do what has to be done.
No, no, no.
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey!
Sir, no.
Look.
I'm a realist, okay.
I understand.
I do.
I get it.
The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few and all that, I understand.
NOLAN:
All right.
Now we walk outta here nice and easy.
AMANDA:
Nolan.
Oh, come on.
Really?
Is that a letter opener?
It's a popular weapon in this office.
Don't make me use it.
NOLAN:
Empty threat, sweetheart.
You'd never kill an innocent kid.
Sure I will.
I'll stab this kid in the throat, your rescue plan will go down the tubes and you'll be forced to play it our way.
It's an attractive option.
It's up to you to come up with something better.
Take them both into custody.
MAN:
Yes, sir.
I trusted you.
I know.
POTTINGER:
Why a rifle?
Dangerous to get too close.
Irisa catches you sneaking up behind her, she'll bring an ark down on your head.
Our snipers are on the first transport out.
I'll radio for them to circle back.
I can do it.
You sure?
I'm an excellent shot.
Better be.
You'll find out soon enough.
Okay, can I explain myself?
You wanna explain why you genetically modified a crazed Indogene to impersonate my sister?
Yeah, I'd like to hear that one.
Now is not the time for this.
We need to be focusing...
Now is exactly the time.
Nobody wants to hear another word out of your lying little mouth!
I've finished creating this super weapon.
There is nothing stopping Amanda from putting a bullet in my head.
I'll put one in you right now!
I have to come clean!
If there's an explanation, I want to hear it.
Now.
I was sick in Camp Reverie.
Starving.
The mayor here made me an offer that I couldn't refuse.
Remember what Nolan said.
My freedom...
That she's a liar!
I was to be a spy for the Votanis Collective, a double agent.
Is that true?
Did you make her a spy?
Well, go on, then.
Now the cat's out of the bag.
Why don't you tell her the rest?
My plan worked.
Given my colorful wartime past, the V.C. were eager to work with me.
But then something strange happened.
Someone in the Votanis Collective, they never told me who, wanted leverage over you.
This unnamed individual forced me to build Kenya.
What I'd like to know is why you've failed to tell me this.
None of this was mentioned in your reports.
Well, if you had known that I was creating that monstrosity, you would have forced me stop, right?
For Amanda's sake.
Of course.
AMANDA:
Oh, come on.
You would've ruined an E-Rep sting just to protect my feelings?
I've done worse.
I'm sorry if I caused you pain, but I had to save my own neck.
Hmm.
I hope you'll remember that later when you put a bullet in Nolan's little girl.
She's coming with us.
I'll grab the roller.
Thanks for that.
I expect you'll find a way to pay me back, Mr. Mayor.
(GRUNTS)
(SCREAMING)
(GRUNTS)
(GROANING)
It's over.
(PANTING)
Are you gonna fall?
Think so.
Oh.
If my parents find out about this, we're dead.
They won't find out.
You know my mom.
Look, we'll be back before they realize we left.
We owe it to the baby to at least explore the option.
And we need to protect her from your father.
Her?
What makes you say "her"?
I have a feeling.
Andina, I hope that we can trust you.
It's my sworn oath to keep family confidences.
Even from other family members.
What's going on?
We should get moving.
Well, hang on.
It might not be safe to travel.
We shouldn't go anywhere until we find out what's going on.
I think we'll be safer on the road.
Let's go.
Why are you pushing so much?
I'm not pushing.
Yeah, you are.
You seem awfully anxious to get us in that car.
I want nothing more than what is best for both of you.
You're family.
Come on.
Alak!
What is wrong with you?
Get in the roller!
Mommy's here.
Let go of me!
And if you struggle, you'll hurt the baby!
Come on.
Get in the car.
(SCREAMS)
Shall I take the shot?
I can do this.
(GUNSHOT) Ah!
(YELLING) (GUNSHOT)
AMANDA:
Don't kill him!
POTTINGER:
Freeze!
Stupid bastard.
(YELLING)
Nolan, you have to stop.
Nolan.
Why don't you throw down the gun?
We settle this like men.
No.
Because you're a bully.
And bullies don't much care for fair fights, do they?
We much prefer results.
Ah.
Sorry, I only brought one pair of cuffs.
You've been waiting for this moment, haven't you?
I have.
Do you know what you've done?
No, I'm not finished yet.
Nolan!
IRISA:
You're too late.
This planet will feel the love of its devouring mother.
Stay away from me.
Stay back!
Kaziri will be harmless
Get away!
so long as the two Kelovan
Just stay back!
Stay away!

I can die!
Please!
Never gonna happen.

Do you know how many people you can still save?
Look at the sky!
Kiddo, look up.
That's it.
This thing's not over.
And the two of you may be the only people who can stop it.
Hey, look at me.
Look at me.
Look at me.
When this thing's over, (SOBBING) you still want that bullet, I will oblige you.
I swear to you.
But until then, you stop this whining, you get on your feet.
Come on.
Come on.
DATAK:
The lights are beautiful.
Do you suppose they bring death?
STAHMA:
Given the evil we've done, and the people we've hurt, a blow struck from the heavens is better than we might have hoped for.
Always the optimist.
ANDINA:
Favis!
Favis!
I have been looking for you everywhere.
Well?
Spit it out.
Our best hope is Rafe McCawley.
He knows that woman.
Knows where she might run.
He'll be able to get inside her head.
Getting inside her head will be easy, once I've blown a large hole in it.
All right.
Come on.
Come on.
Move it.
We don't have all day.
Let's go.
Line up.
Line it up.
Ready?
And fire.
Hey!
What the hell is going on here?
Have you seen the purple lights?
Huh?
The prisoners panicked and started a riot.
We don't have any backup.
I'm taking matters into my own hands.
You make me sick, Sergeant.
You are relieved of your command.
Take those prisoners back inside.
Go!

KAI:

That's right.
We're gonna do it all over again.
Sukar.
Well, that's a new look for him.
I take it we're looking for this arkbrain?
It's this way.
We should be able to control it with our keys.
Force it to send the terraspheres back into orbit before they blow.
What?
Company.
No.
No, no.
No!
No!
(SCREAMING)
So many ways to die in this new world.
Hellbugs, wulokot fever.
A firing squad feels...
Quaint?
Yeah.
Quaint.
Ready!
And... (MACHINE GUN FIRING)
Good evening, Captain.
We need this man.
Family emergency.
(LAUGHS)
What's going on?
Pilar has kidnapped Alak and Christie.
Oh, God.
Do you know where she might've taken them?
I dunno.
I'll have to think about that.
You should've killed her all those years ago.
Yeah, well, live and learn.
Tommy.
How are you here?
Let me out.
I have to get back to the mines.
You're still in the mines.
A year ago you let Kaziri inside you.
To save Nolan.
Yes.
But you let me die.
I didn't deserve it.
Nolan is the one you shoulda let die.
You know what kinda man he is.
But you sacrifice everything to save him.
Where's my sacrifice?
I deserve better from you.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Don't say you're sorry.
Fix it.
How?
Kaziri can bring me back.
Just let her finish her mission.
NOLAN:
The ship is scared.
She'll bring me back.
I can live.
We can live.
NOLAN:
It knows we can stop it.
I can be with you.
NOLAN:
Kiddo, none of this is real.
Wake up.
The Kaziri is messing with your head.
Ignore whatever it's telling you.
I can be with you.
You can be my beautiful wife.
All you have to do is say yes.
She obeys her programing.
She never falters on her promises.
She'll bring me back.
Just like Sukar and Nolan.
I just want my chance to live.
Please.
The Kaziri is trying to stall you!
And I wanna spend the rest of my life with you.
NOLAN: (WHISPERS) Listen to me carefully.
In your heart, you know this is not Tommy LaSalle.
Tommy is dead.
You have to let him go.
I know that's hard, but I raised you to do the right thing.
You know what's right.
I believe in you.
Please.
I'm sorry, Tommy.
The answer is no.
(SCREAMING) Why?
(PANTING)
KAI:
It was horrible.
I saw my dead parents.
They said I abandoned them in Tallahassee.
What was that?
NOLAN:
Proof that the ship is scared.
She ought to be.
NOLAN:
Okay, kiddo.
Do your thing.
Everything's riding on this.
The keys are overriding the system.
We should be linked now.
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
It's a little weird.
Your voice is really loud.
IRISA:
Can you access the terraspheres?
KAI:
No.
The arkbrain's blocking me.
IRISA:
I'm shutting it down now.
I'm dying.
And it's your fault.
I have to complete my mission.
It's okay.
No!
I have to!
No.
It's okay.
You can go.
IRISA:
Okay, Kai.
She's gone for good.
You're clear.
KAI:
The spheres are about to detonate.
IRISA:
Shoot them into orbit.
KAI:
Okay.
Here goes nothing.
He did it.
He did it!
We're all gonna live.
(GASPS)
That's it?
Looks like we just saved the world.
NOLAN:
This whole place is gonna come down on our ears.
Come on, you go.
Come on, kiddo.
On your feet.
Come on.
Here.
That's it.
Come on.
All right.
Look at me.
Hey.
Just look at me.
That's it.
That's it.
You're all right.
You're okay.

SOMEONE IN THE VOTANIS COLLECTIVE,
THEY NEVER TOLD ME WHO,
WANTED LEVERAGE OVER YOU.

YOU WOULD HAVE FORCED ME TO STOP, RIGHT?

YOU WOULD HAVE RUINED AN E-REP STING
JUST TO PROTECT MY FEELINGS?
- I'VE DONE WORSE.

So you're saying in some past life, you and Irisa removed the keys to the ship?
Past lives... maybe our ancestors?
I don't really understand it.
All I know is they scuttled the Kaziri and saved humanity.
Oh, stupid bags.
This is crazy.
Here, let me help.
Hey, what are you doing?
What was that for?
A savior ought to travel light.
I never claimed to be a savior.
These...
Ow!
These visions, they could be fantasies.
I don't think so.
That ship that's controlling Irisa is scared of you, which means you are a threat.
How could I be a threat to a big, scary spaceship?
All right.
Having both the keys inside Irisa reactivated the Kaziri.
We need to separate the keys.
Separate?
Separate how?
Same your ancestor did.
By putting one inside me?
No way.
Let me break this down for you.
You can come with me willingly, or you can come strapped to the hood of my roller.
Either way, you're gonna help me stop my daughter.
Stop her?
I thought we were trying to help her.
Stop her from doing what?
Here, you want this?
Come and get it.
Here, here.
Andina, right?
Yes, Favi Datak.
Welcome home.
Where is my wife?
She's entertaining Favi Christie's mother.
If you think I'm gonna let some snooty shanje stick insect raise my family, you are crazy.
You gave up any claim to parenting when you left Defiance.
Is there a problem?
Datak.
Welcome home, my love.
You remember Pilar, Rafe's wife.
I do.
She was something of a junkie for the mood stabilizers I would procure for her back in the old days.
That was a long time ago.
I'm much better now.
Good.
Well, I would hate to return after a long absence to find you insulting my wife in our own home.
It might lead me to extreme actions.
No offense was taken, my love.
Pilar was merely asking if we might allow
Alak and Christie to live under her roof for a while.
I'm afraid my answer disappointed her.
Well, that is a shame.
Well, while I've been gone, you two have carved out quite the niche for yourselves.
I've asked around.
You know, some people find you scary.
I don't, of course.
I think you're a carnival act.
Funny little white-faced clowns.
I remember when Datak used to do card tricks for old-earth dollars.
You, Stahma, you were a housemaid.
Do you remember that one time when our regular maid was sick and you came over and cleaned my toilets?
You had a gift.
As you say, that was a long time ago.
Now your beautiful home belongs to the Earth Republic, your wealthy husband is in prison, and your daughter's love is mine.
Nothing remains for you here.
Take your unfortunate son and leave our town.
I won't warn you twice.
You know, she blew my husband.
Just thought you should know.
She's lying, of course.
Of course.
Welcome home, hanizu.
E-rats a bit jumpy today.
New York's been radio silent all morning.
They're saying it's probably just a defective relay station, but it's got the E-rats spooked.
Animals.
Have you two really considered the future?
In what way?
Defiance used to be a free city.
Now it's a satellite of the Earth Republic.
Dad says that's temporary.
Dad's in an E-Rep jail.
Quentin, don't talk with your mouth full.
No matter what the propaganda says, the E-Rep has always been about Human primacy.
Mixed-species children are treated like second-class citizens.
The Votanis Collective isn't any better.
There are seven races of Votans.
They've been forced to deal with one another for thousands of years.
The Votans understand the value of assimilation.
I could show you.
Show us what?
There's a Harmony Collective.
South of here, maybe 300 klicks past Cedars...
Humans and Votans living side by side.
It's everything that Defiance was supposed to be.
Plenty of mixed-species children so the baby won't feel like an outcast.
Why have I never heard of this place?
It's also a research facility.
Some of the tech they use there is classified.
For example, they breed horses there.
Horses?
Seriously?
That's impossible.
All the horses died in the plagues.
Indogene technology brought them back.
Six weeks ago, I rode a palomino mare.
Gorgeous, indescribable.
Do you want to ride her?
I would love to ride a horse.
But I don't want to give you the wrong idea.
Our home is here.
Well, just for an overnight.
A visit.
And if you like it there, then we can talk about staying longer-term.
You expect us to, what, just abandon my mother?
No.
I'm sure we could work something out.
And I assume your dad will want to come too, since he's moved back in.
He...
Well, maybe your mother wanted to surprise you.
Excuse me.
Could you excuse us, please?
Sure, honey.
I'll get the check.
There is no commune, is there?
You made that whole thing up.
Pay the bill, genius.
Mmm...
Why is he here?
Your father and I have decided to move forward.
Together.
As a family.
After everything he's done?
All my misdeeds are behind us, hanya tavo.
I'm not your hanya tavo.
Let us look to the future, one that would be incomplete without the family together.
Our family?
You mean the one you scarred and tried to drown?
Are you aware of how much pain you've caused?
Well, it's not like I dropped a whore from the top of the gateway arch, now, is it?

I'm sorry.
That was... thank you for that.
Just...
I appreciate it.

Could you make this any more difficult?

I...
I thought it was funny.
You okay, boss?
New York's gone dark.
The relay posts are receiving dead air.
There's no chatter of any kind.
We're hoping it's a technical glitch.
What's this for?
Berlin, what is it?
What's wrong?
Tommy's dead.
What?
How?
Irisa.
She killed him.
- She wouldn't.
- Ho ho.
Nolan says it's not her fault, that she's not acting like herself.
But, see, I don't believe that because Tommy knew that she was dangerous and...
He didn't want her anywhere near me.
He knew.
Sorry.
I don't know what to say.
I can't believe it.
And that's confirmed?
What?
What just happened?
New York's gone.
Madame Mayor.
We got the news on the trip back to New York.
Defiance was the closest town.
We're setting up a command center in mayor Pottinger's office, and I'd like you to join.
Captain, have you been drinking?
Yes, sir.
You might want to gargle.
Amanda, you're with me.
Something's up.
Come on.
Come on.
Nope, I don't believe it.
Only the Votanis Collective has the firepower to terraform the entire city.
Clearly, we're at war.
I'm telling you, Irisa is the key.
And that arkbrain that's controlling her has no intention of stopping with New York.
For the moment, let's assume we're buying your story.
What's your plan?
We need to get this man next to Irisa.
This guy?
He can extract the tech that's controlling Irisa.
Whenever I was near her, I could feel something pulling at me.
It felt as though one of the pieces of tech wants me.
I mean, to be inside me.
That's not coming out right.
I...
Look, you know Colonel Marsh has a sealed file on Irisa.
Unseal it.
It'll back up everything I'm saying.
Classified files are kept in New York, which proves somewhat inconvenient.
Actually, I believe Mr. Nolan.
Votan-controlled Belize just went dark.
The Votans would never strike their own people.
What I have trouble believing is that you knew this girl was on the watch list, and you gave her a badge.
Would you care to explain that?
He did it for me.
Jesus, Niles.
Can't you just pay for sex like a normal person?
I did it because Amanda believed it was best for the town... and I trust her judgment.
And I would make the same decision again and again and again.
I think you should leave.
With pleasure.
Hold it right there!
On your knees!
- Go!
- On your knees!
Don't move a muscle.
There's no need to fire, boys.
I'm unarmed.
I need you to take me to your commanding officer immediately.
There's an extremely powerful sentient computer that intends to destroy the planet.
That's the bad news.
Good news is I know how to kill it.
Congratulations, Doctor.
You're no longer a war criminal.
Your turn now.
You believe you can stop Irisa?
I've been inside the ship that's controlling her.
I got my hands on some higher cognitive data crystals.
I can introduce a virus that will order the arkbrain fragments inside of Irisa to self-detonate.
- Is that gonna hurt her?
- Brief, intense flash of pain.
- Her death will transmit the...
- Whoa, hold on.
Infected fragments back to the Kaziri and kill it.
You are not to go anywhere near my daughter.
- Terraforming will end.
- Do you understand me?
Oh, I'm sorry.
I thought we were all serious about saving the planet.
My bad.
I can do this without bloodshed.
What do you need to make this happen?
An hour in my lab.
Sir, this woman is a liar.
You can't trust her.
My plan will work.
Amanda, tell him.
If Yewll thinks that she can save her skin by killing Irisa and saving the planet, then that's exactly what she would do.
Amanda, escort the good doctor to her lab.
If she gets tricky, you can kill her.
No, hold on.
I said hold on!
I hope you'll forgive me for this.
Forgive you for what?
Nolan needs to be locked up.
He'll never let us do what has to be done.
No, no, no.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Sir, no, look.
I'm a realist, okay.
I understand.
I do.
I get it.
The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few and all that...
I understand.
All right.
Now we walk out of here nice and easy.
Nolan.
Oh, come on.
Really?
Is that a letter opener?
It's a popular weapon in this office.
Don't make me use it.
Empty threat, sweetheart.
You'd never kill an innocent kid.
Sure I will.
I'll stab this kid in the throat, your rescue plan will go down the tubes, and you'll be forced to play it our way.
It's an attractive option.
It's up to you to come up with something better.
Take them both into custody.
Yes, sir.
I trusted you.
I know.
- Why a rifle?
- Dangerous to get too close.
Irisa catches you sneaking up behind her, she'll bring an ark down on your head.
Our snipers are on the first transport out.
I'll radio for them to circle back.
I can do it.
Are you sure?
- I'm an excellent shot.
- Better be.
Oh, you'll find out soon enough.
Okay, can I explain myself?
You want to explain why you genetically modified a crazed Indogene to impersonate my sister?
- Yeah, I'd like to hear that.
- Now is not the time for this.
- We need to be focusing...
- Now is exactly the time.
Nobody wants to hear another word out of your lying mouth.
I have finished creating this superweapon.
There is nothing stopping Amanda from putting a bullet in my head.
I'll put one in you right now.
If there's an explanation, I want to hear it, now.
I was sick in Camp Reverie.
Starving.
The mayor here made me an offer I couldn't refuse, my freedom.
Remember what Nolan said.
She's a liar!
I was to be a spy for the Votanis Collective, a double agent.
Is that true?
Did you make her a spy?
Hold on, now.
Now the cat's out of the bag.
Why don't you tell her the rest?
Our plan worked.
Given my colorful wartime past, the V.C. were eager to work with me.
But then something strange happened.
Someone in the Votanis Collective, they never told me who, wanted leverage over you.
This unnamed individual forced me to build Kenya.
What I'd like to know is why you failed to tell me this.
None of this was mentioned in your reports.
Well, if you had known that I was creating that monstrosity, you would have forced me to stop, right?
For Amanda's sake.
Of course.
Oh, come on.
You would have ruined an E-Rep sting just to protect my feelings?
I've done worse.
I'm sorry if I caused you pain, but I had to save my own neck.
I hope you'll remember that later when you put a bullet in Nolan's little girl.
She's coming with us.
I'll grab the roller.
Thanks for that.
I expect you'll find a way to pay me back, Mr. Mayor.
We got two more.
In aaah!
Ah-uhh-uhhhh...
Ah!
Oh.
Oh.
It's over.
Are you gonna fall?
Think so.
Whoa.
If my parents find out about this, we're dead.
They won't find out.
You know my mom.
Look, we'll be back before they realize we left.
We owe it to the baby to at least explore the option.
And we need to protect her from your father.
"Her"?
What makes you say "her"?
I have a feeling.
Andina, I hope that we can trust you.
It's my sworn oath to keep family confidences.
Even from other family members.
- Look, there it is again.
- There!
There.
Yeah, I see it.
What is that?
- Started about 20 minutes ago.
- Another arkfall?
- What's going on?
- We should get moving.
What... hang on.
It might not be safe to travel.
We shouldn't go anywhere until we find out what's going on.
I think we'll be safer on the road.
Let's go.
Why are you pushing so much?
I'm not pushing.
Yeah, you are.
You seem awfully anxious to get us in that car.
I want nothing more than what is best for both of you.
You're family.
Come on.
Alak!
What is wrong with you?
Get in the roller!
Mommy's here.
Let go of me!
And if you struggle, you'll hurt the baby.
Come on, get in the car.
Should I take the shot?
I can do this.
Ah!
Aaaah!
Don't kill him!
Freeze!
- Stupid bastard.
- Aaah!
Ugh!
- Nolan, you have to stop.
- Come here.
Nolan.
Why don't you throw down the gun and we settle this like men?
No.
Because you're a bully.
And bullies don't care much for fair fights, do they?
We much prefer results.
Doc.
Sorry, I only brought one pair of cuffs.
You've been waiting for this moment, haven't you?
I have.
Oh!
Do you know what you've done?
Dunno.
Not finished yet.
Nolan!
Ugh.
You're too late.
This planet will feel the love of its devouring mother.
Stay away from me.
Stay back.

- Just stay back.
Stay away.

- No.
No!
No!
No!

Hey, Irisa.
Hey.
Hey.
Come back to me.
That's it.
Come back.
There you are.
Hey, kiddo.
- Hey.
- Tommy.
That wasn't you.
No.
No.
No, that wasn't you.
- Give me your gun.
- No.
Stop it.
Give me your gun or shoot me yourself.
- Not gonna happen.
- It'll work now.
- I can die.
Please!
- Never gonna happen.
Do you know how many people I have killed?
Do you know how many people you can still save?
Look at the sky.
Kiddo, look up.
That's it.
This thing's not over.
And the two of you may be the only people who can stop it.
Hey, look at me.
Look at me.
Look at me.
When this thing's over, you still want that bullet,
I will oblige you, I swear to you.
But until then, you stop this whining and get on your feet.
Come on.
Come on.
The lights are beautiful.
Do you suppose they bring death?
Given the evil we've done and the people we've hurt, a blow struck from the heavens is better than we might have hoped for.
Always the optimist.
Favis!
Favis!
I've been looking for you everywhere.
Well, spit it out.
Our best hope is Rafe McCawley.
He knows that woman.
Knows where she might run.
He'll be able to get inside her head.
Getting inside her head will be easy, once I've blown a large hole in it.
Irina, come on!

Come on, move it.
We don't have all day.
Let's go.
Line up.
Line it up!
Ready!
And fire!
Hey!
What the hell is going on here?
Have you seen the purple lights?
Huh?
The prisoners panicked and started a riot.
We don't have any back-up.
I'm taking matters into my own hands.
You make me sick, Sergeant.
You are relieved of your command.
Take those prisoners back inside.
Go!
You filthy piece of...
Ugh!
I've been here before.
- You and I were here together.
- We scuttled the ship.
That's right.
We're going to do it all over again.
Sukar.
Well, that's a new look for him.
I take it we're looking for this arkbrain.
It's this way.
We should be able to control it with our keys, force it to send the terraspheres back into orbit before they blow.
What?
Company.
No.
No, no.
No!
No!
No!
No!
So many ways to die in this new world.
Hellbugs, wulokot fever.
A firing squad feels...
Quaint?
Yeah, quaint.
Ready!
And...
Good evening, Captain.
We need this man.
Family emergency.
What's going on?
Pilar has kidnapped Alak and Christie.
Oh, God.
Do you know where she might have taken them?
I don't know.
I'll have to think about that.
You should've killed her all those years ago.
Yeah, well, live and learn.
Tommy?
How are you here?
Let me out.
I have to get back to the mines.
You're still in the mines.
A year ago, you let Kaziri inside you.
To save Nolan.
Yes.
But you let me die.
I didn't deserve it.
Nolan is the one you should let die.
You know what kind of man he is.
But you sacrificed everything to save him.
Where is my sacrifice?
I deserve better from you.
I know.
I'm sorry.
Don't say you're sorry.
Fix it.
How?
Kaziri can bring me back.
Just let her finish her mission.
The ship is scared.
She'll bring me back.
I can live.
We can live.
It knows we can stop it.
I can be with you.
Do you know none of this is real.
Wake up.
The Kaziri's messing with your head.
Ignore whatever it's telling you.
I can be with you.
You can be my beautiful wife.
All you have to do is say yes.
She obeys her programming.
She never falters on her promises.
She'll bring me back.
Just like Sukar and Nolan.
I just want my chance to live.
Please.
The Kaziri's trying to stall you.
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.
Listen to me carefully.
In you heart, you know this is not Tommy Lasalle.
Tommy is dead.
You have to let him go.
I know that's hard, but I raised you to do the right thing.
You know what's right.
I believe in you.
Please.
I'm sorry, Tommy.
The answer is no.
Why?
It was horrible.
I saw my dead parents.
They said I abandoned them in Tallahassee.
What was that?
Proof that the ship is scared.
She ought to be.
Okay, kiddo, do your thing.
Everything's riding on this.
The keys are overriding the system.
We should be linked now.
Can you hear me?
Yeah.
It's a little weird.
Your voice is really loud.
Can you access the terraspheres?
No.
The arkbrain's blocking me.
I'm shutting it down now.
I'm dying.
And it's your fault.
I have to complete my mission.
- It's okay.
- No, I have to.
No, it's okay.
You can go.
Okay, Kai.
She's gone for good.
You're clear.
The spheres are about to detonate.
Shoot them into orbit.
Okay.
Here goes nothing.
He did it.
He did it.
We're all going to live.
That's it?
Looks like we just saved the world.
This whole place is gonna come down on our ears.
Come on, you go.
Come on, kiddo.
On your feet.
Come on.
Here.
That's it, all right.
All right, look at me.
Hey.
Look at me.
That's it.
That's it.
You're all right.
You're okay.
I love you, baby girl.

YOU CAN BE MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE.
ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS SAY YES.
SHE OBEYS HER PROGRAMMING.
SHE NEVER FALTERS ON HER PROMISES.
SHE'LL BRING ME BACK.
JUST LIKE SUKAR AND NOLAN.
I JUST WANT MY CHANCE TO LIVE.
PLEASE.
- THE KAZIRI'S TRYING TO STALL YOU.
- I WANT TO SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE WITH YOU.
[Nolan, whispering] LISTEN TO ME CAREFULLY.
IN YOU HEART, YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT TOMMY LASALLE.
TOMMY IS DEAD.
YOU HAVE TO LET HIM GO.
I KNOW THAT'S HARD,
BUT I RAISED YOU TO DO THE RIGHT THING.
YOU KNOW WHAT'S RIGHT.
I BELIEVE IN YOU.
- PLEASE.

THE ANSWER IS NO.

- IT WAS HORRIBLE.
I SAW MY DEAD PARENTS.

WHAT WAS THAT?
- PROOF THAT THE SHIP IS SCARED.

EVERYTHING'S RIDING ON THIS.

Petite Reine:
Downfall of a Champion
Really?
That's good.
Tell him.
He'll be happy.
The papers here didn't cover it.
That's how it is with women's racing.
A full page?
That's really cool.
- Tell him, already.
- l'm not even there, Dad.
- lt'll make him happy.
We're leaving in...
- ln an hour.
- About an hour.
Go out for supper?
What does Mom think?
I wanted to relax with just the two of you.
You decide, Dad.
Yeah.
Here he is.
Hi, Alain.
Yeah.
She surpassed her time trial.
20 kilometres in 27.45!
Yeah, it's amazing.
It's looking good?
Did you throw out all the food?
Go buy some champagne right now.
This is our year for the World Cup.
Definitely.
Alain, I have to go.
Yeah.
OK, perfect.
Bye.
But they were here yesterday.
I just injected myself.
JP, what do we do?
Get the iv bag, then do push-ups.
- No, no.
- Do it!
Keep going.
Come on!
- Where were you?
- Slowing him down.
It'll be OK.
Keep going!
It'll be fine!
C'mon, fuck.
Sit down.
Put it in, now.
- l can't do it, JP.
- C'mon, fuck.
- The stuff!
- Squeeze, damn it.
The stuff.
- Squeeze hard.
- l'm squeezing!
Let's go.
Squeeze.
- The bike!
- Fuck!
Get on and pedal.
Gimme that.
Come on!
Come on!
Right, good.
Come on, let's go!
Faster.
Break.
JP.
If he comes in, you slip out.
No, it'll be all right.
This way.
Hurry.
C'mon.
Hurry up.
Squeeze.
Keep squeezing.
Keep squeezing, fuck.
- l'm squeezing.
- Until he comes back.
When he does...
- Then what?
Then take it out.
And turn off the shower.
Squeeze!
Dad, can you put this in my room?
- Sure.
- Thanks.
He reserved at Baton Rouge.
- At Roberto's. lt's quieter.
- Thanks, Mom.
She's too tired to be hassled.
It's in half an hour, OK?
- Perfect.
Good.
Suzanne, the ones from Hamilton are nicer.
Yes, definitely.
We should put them in a special case.
- We'd see them better.
- Yes.
- You'll need another shelf.
- l guess so.
What's up with you two?
You know how she gets when you're gone.
You should talk.
He spent his weekends scrapbooking.
Seriously, Dad?
Albums are meant to be looked at sometimes.
Let's go.
Your mom's nerves get on my nerves.
Good.
Mom, in five minutes, OK?
When I dream, I see a medal and the podium.
Realizing your dream is great, but it's work.
- lt's not work.
- Yes, it is.
Ten races in less than four months.
It sounds fun, but I'm on my bike six hours a day.
I train in Arizona in winter and race the rest of the year.
Friends, computer games...
I've never known any of that.
I'm alone or with my coach, training hard.
- ls the money good?
- She isn't Lance Armstrong.
Not yet.
But you are a star.
No, that's not how it works.
- How does it work?
- When I win a race, I don't do it alone.
I have a team.
For example, a paceline is really important.
It's a way to position ourselves.
We take turns, being shielded from the wind.
Like geese.
I don't know about birds.
My team shields me the whole time, so I'm stronger for the final sprint.
And we have a great coach.
Fucking pedal, already!
He decides strategy, observes who's better on hills or flat roads and takes it from there.
It's all planned in advance.
When you win, is it you or the whole team?
- lt's me.
- Then you are the star.
Yes.
They could win, but their priority is the leader.
That sucks for them.
Why do they do it?
They love cycling and they get a salary.
But they're paid less than you.
Yes, that's true.
I'm also sponsored.
My contract states I get a bonus when I win.
So winning is important.
I'm not supposed to say that.
They don't teach that at school.
"lt's not winning, but taking part that counts."
Right, but if you don't win, what will you take part in?
You were good.
The kids loved it.
Sorry for not following the game plan.
It was perfect.
From the heart and no bullshit.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
Don't forget Saturday's telethon.
- Yes.
We have the outdoor fair on the 25th, the Breakfast Club the 26th, the radio interview the 29th, and the Gala after the race.
I left the schedule with your dad.
Perfect.
Drop me off at the next light.
- Don't you want a ride home?
- l'm meeting a friend.
- l can take you.
- Right here is perfect.
OK.
OK.
Bye.
- Bye.
- Take care.
Private Orthopedic Clinic
You really hurt yourself.
What were we supposed to do?
How much did you intake?
A half, two-thirds?
- Two-thirds.
- At least three-fourths.
- Three-fourths?
It's all right.
- Really?
I wasn't sure.
I had just injected myself.
It's not that bad!
The solution lowered your hematocrit by three points.
You were probably at 46 when you were tested.
Might raise a red flag, but it's within limits.
There.
What did I tell you?
She always argues with me.
- Drop it, Dr. JP.
You'll be fine, JP did good.
I know, but still.
Your pressure is good.
Any dizziness?
- No.
- Arrythmia?
- No.
Good.
Any pain?
- No. lt's good.
- Are you eating well?
- Not bad.
Oh, boy.
Don't mess with that, Julie.
None of my sport clients have built a career eating tofu and salad.
You have to eat.
I'll try harder.
But I am taking your supplements.
Attagirl!
You're my idol.
Should I renew the anti-inflammatories?
- l have some left.
- Same as usual?
Keep going.
One more minute.
Not too hard.
Keep it at 300 watts.
Why are you going so fast?
Hi, love.
Hi.
You okay?
- Yes.
You?
- Leave it there to dry.
- l got it.
Hi, sweetie.
C'mon, keep going.
What are you doing at 320?
I said 300.
Lower it or you won't be able to finish.
I said down.
Bring it to 300.
Not up.
Down.
I'll knock you down.
I said 300.
What the hell?
Shit.
That's what happens when you're overconfident.
I'm not overconfident.
You and your smug face.
- What smug face?
- That one.
Save the look you had in the garage for the track.
OK. lt's fine.
Really?
is that why you're half dead on my kitchen floor?
- My back hurts. lt feels good.
- Take two.
You don't appreciate people who want the best for you.
You don't listen during training.
Here, love.
What now?
The Federation left a message.
- Hello.
- Hi.
They're in François's office.
Why aren't you training?
- What are you doing here?
- He called.
- Hi.
- Hi.
is something wrong?
They don't have your itinerary for the upcoming months.
The Anti-Doping Agency has asked me for it three times.
Why didn't you ask JP to send it?
He never returns my calls.
Yeah...
There's a lot going on.
- They're so busy.
This isn't up-to-date, Dad.
- What?
- You know the rules.
They can suspend you for that.
I know. I'm really sorry.
I just forgot.
You coming, Dad?
They sent your last test results.
Have you seen them?
You have irregularities.
- Really?
- But all's good.
is it your anemia, again?
- You're anemic?
- She has been for years.
My blood sucks or it's their test.
That's that.
If it's your blood, fix it.
It's unhealthy.
Don't worry.
Dr. Henri says it's under control.
You should see a specialist.
- He is a specialist...
- An orthopedist.
It'll be fine, François.
It'd be a shame if she were disqualified.
- Disqualified?
- Why would I be?
- ls something wrong?
- Of course not.
- l've always respected requirements.
- But...
Hang on there.
Has she or not?
She has.
But at the Federation, we know sports-medicine specialists who would take excellent care of her.
François, athletes are fine-tuned but fragile machines.
You need the right person.
Dr. Henri has followed her since she's 14.
- Sure, but...
- l appreciate it, but it's fine.
Why are the Chinese such sourpusses on Olympic podiums?
They feel guilty for taking a break.
Pull up your zipper a bit.
Cheese, everyone!
- Perfect.
That's everything.
- Good.
I'm getting a drink.
I'm dying to leave.
I'll be in the hall.
Check out Ducros.
Hi.
Didn't she have chicken thighs?
That chicken's fed with hormones now.
Told you it was her on the track.
- When?
- We trained two days ago.
- Why didn't you call me?
- We did.
I called JP.
Didn't he tell you?
Julie. interview.
- With who?
- Thierry Côté.
Tall red-headed guy.
Really nice.
Mic.
Hi.
It's unusual to see you here, Ms. Lebigot.
The Canadian Anti-Doping Program is sending a clear message to all sport disciplines:
Our presence will be stronger.
Ms. Lebigot, can that really stop doping once and for all?
I don't know...
Lobster in Nantua sauce.
is that good?
OK for the appetizers and the lobster.
I hate it when she does that.
It's a good sign.
Means she's going to win.
035...
Put a three.
It doesn't work.
It'll cost a fortune!
- lt does work.
- Could you stop?
!
- lt's starting.
- And a pastry platter...
Suzanne.
Hurry up.
It played three times today.
Your feet.
- The two stars of this edition...
- Listen to this.
Belgian Renalda Ducros, 2nd in the standings, right behind Quebec's darling, the incredible Julie Arseneau...
"The incredible Julie Arseneau."
- Who's at the top...
- My daughter!
Julie, are you nervous about the next stage in the Cup?
Honestly, no.
We're ready.
We're so happy it's in Quebec.
It's an honour to race at home.
We're really looking forward to it.
That's that.
Thanks, Julie.
Good luck.
Climbing should be easy.
They've paved those streets.
But on Decelles and Côte-des-Neiges, there are potholes, so watch out.
...with a close second by Renalda Ducros from Belgium.
Faster, Julie!
...has managed to take the lead.
You three lead out on the last turn.
The French and Belgians will definitely be there.
Keep a fast pace to block an attack.
- OK.
- Cool.
Julie and Valerie, hide nearby for as long as possible.
Once on Parc Avenue,
Julie, sprint like hell.
No one's going to wait for you.
No problem.
Fuck!
My chain.
- What?
How the fuck did it fall off?
!
Get it back on and hustle!
Jess.
Cynthia--
- Too far.
We're stuck behind.
- Val, where are you?
Valerie Morin, from team Vita, overtakes her teammate, who's having some trouble.
She's speeding towards the French and Belgian leaders.
- Go!
Hammer it, Julie.
Go.
She's off the saddle.
Go for it.
Keep it up.
Jump across.
Go.
She's back in the race.
She's caught up with Ducros.
You're there. lt's yours.
This comes down to Frenchwoman Eugénie Polard and Quebec's darling, Julie Arseneau!
What a race!
It doesn't get better than this!
Arseneau rides to victory!
She gave everything she had on those last 500 metres!
What an extraordinary feat.
Miss Arseneau, new protocol.
We need a blood sample.
No problem.
is it the champagne?
There's one race left!
It's just sparkling wine.
The champagne is for Belgium.
- You OK, sweetie?
- My head hurts.
- A toast.
- Suzanne, here's a glass.
Everyone, a toast.
To the whole team.
Girls, two medals in one race.
I'm speechless.
JP, impeccable!
We're lucky to have you, coach.
- Thanks.
- lmpeccable.
And of course, our champion.
This race belongs to her.
We're proud of you.
Cheers!
- Cheers!
- Eat some meatballs.
- Not too many.
This smells delicious.
Same restaurant as last time?
Yes. lt's the best.
You're the best.
- Do you want anything?
- Here, champion.
- No, thanks.
- l'll take that.
Thanks.
Bring me a plate?
She has a migraine.
I'll go talk to her.
Suzanne, get me some meatballs.
Mind if I take a dip?
- Absolutely not.
- OK!
What's wrong?
They did a blood test after the race.
"New protocol."
Don't think about that, now.
I was the only one tested.
I'll have irregularities again.
I'll take care of it, OK?
Don't worry.
I'm really freaking out.
Tell me you'll take care of it.
I'll take care of it.
Promise?
Promise.
In the pool.
It's like training in high altitude.
It's perfectly legal.
- Did you invent this?
- This model, yes.
I have more sophisticated ones, but basically, they all lower oxygen in the blood.
After sleeping in this tent, a higher hematocrit level is normal.
It naturally increases the number of red blood cells.
Do people believe you?
Of course.
It's the latest craze.
- You OK?
- What?
Yes, I'm fine.
- How much for this model?
- Two thousand.
They're not cheap.
- lt's a good investment.
- For who?
Well?
- lt's ridiculous.
I've been asked to give out awards to the best Vita reps.
Honestly, it's an honour for me to be here and meet you.
- l'm starving.
- l have toothpaste.
- Doesn't work.
- lt does too.
Only for five minutes.
For those of you coming on stage, I'll keep close.
Because even if we won in Montreal last Sunday... lt's... lt's not over.
She found something.
We'll need all your energy, because in two weeks, we'll be in Belgium for the World Cup.
There's a vending machine by the pool.
I always gain weight between races.
Claude, even if you don't have the guts to ride with me - or is it because you're always playing with your phone...
Thank you for your faith in me and for your friendship.
The World Cup is yours!
We'll work hard.
That's for sure.
Yes!
Thank you.
The award for the best Vita Sales Team goes to...
She's not going out with us tonight.
- What is it?
- lt's Dr. Henri.
- What about him?
- lt's coming out tomorrow.
Tell Claude none of it is true.
is this a joke?
He ratted you out.
Talk to him when he gets off stage.
I'll be in the car.
Did he believe you?
I don't know.
I can't go home.
- You have to.
He won't drop it.
You know how he gets.
- Hi.
- JP, what's up?
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Either he was caught selling doping products to athletes, or someone sold him out.
He named just about anyone.
The list hasn't been made public yet, but you know reporters.
- ls Julie on that list?
- We just don't know.
He could have lied to save his ass.
We don't know a thing.
There will certainly be an inquiry.
Definitely.
Anyway, this is one big misunderstanding.
Why would anyone accuse Julie?
He got caught, so he said anything.
The police showed up and he panicked.
Why her?
He can denounce away, but Julie hasn't done anything wrong.
- She has nothing to be ashamed of.
- Exactly.
- Where is she?
- ls she OK?
She's still at the Vita Gala.
Claude is handling it.
- Go to her, Alain.
- No, don't.
She won't be long.
She might even be on her way.
The best thing is to avoid upsetting her.
- You think?
- Yes.
Holy shit.
We're stopping.
We have no choice but to stop.
We'll get caught.
We won't.
No one here is getting caught.
What now?
I don't know.
I don't want to go home.
No, no.
I have to go.
Nathalie is all nerves.
And... I don't wanna...
What about me?
I'll drive you home.
I barely said a thing.
They already knew everything.
In fact, they made assumptions.
I just answered their questions.
They treated me like a criminal.
They searched everywhere.
I didn't want to hurt you, Julie.
Fine.
Just write, then.
They threatened to revoke my licence, I had no choice.
Write.
Go on, write.
I've never taken any.
I've never seen any.
No one has ever offered me any.
I don't even know what it looks like.
You've never used doping products?
- Never.
- Any steroids?
- No.
- Any blood transfusions?
Vitamins.
Just vitamins.
Was Dr. Henri your doctor?
Yes.
We have his letter confirming that if she is on the list of athletes he said he supplied doping products to, it's a mistake.
You'll get a copy after the press conference.
Was he referred to you by another athlete?
No.
My coach knew him.
I've been a patient since I was fourteen.
For what?
- Anemia.
- Why then be followed by an orthopedist instead of a hematologist?
Dr. Henri was someone Julie and her coach trusted.
If her coach introduced them, why isn't he here?
Because this is about me.
You're targeted by the Anti-Doping Agency.
How long have suspicions surrounded you?
There are no suspicions surrounding me.
Top athletes are tested worldwide.
It's part of a normal process.
It doesn't mean anything.
There have been blood irregularities.
We won't go into details about her health.
Those irregularities are simply due to my altitude tent.
It's legal.
- Altitude tent?
It helps with recovery, but it raises hematocrit levels.
You must admit, for reporters covering you for years, an altitude tent seems to come out of nowhere.
It was a secret.
Now, it has to come out, though I'm not happy about my competitors knowing.
According to you, what happens next?
Nothing has changed.
My team and I are going for the Cup.
And we will make Quebec proud.
Vita reiterates its support for Julie Arseneau and her family.
It's an honour to have her as spokesperson, and we're confident Team Vita will succeed at the World Cup.
That's all for now.
Thank you.
- Very good.
- Sorry I never mentioned the tent.
- You hadn't?
- Not sure.
Technical stuff...
- Bravo.
- Good job.
Wasn't she amazing?
You were so impressive, facing down those reporters.
Claude did help.
Reporters will be hounding you.
Ignore them and don't worry.
I'll handle everything.
It'll be all right.
How did it go?
- Didn't you watch?
- l tried to, but...
- She was great.
Firm.
- Good.
You really didn't watch?
!
Why would I?
It's a bunch of lies.
- Not what I said.
- You know how emotional he gets.
- Alain is such a big softy.
- Whatever.
The inquiry into Dr. Henri's fraud falls under criminal jurisdiction and not the Agency's.
Damn right.
But Ms. Arseneau's evasive answers concerning her high hematocrit level and her altitude tent... leave much to be desired.
- What do they all have against her?
But her tent isn't illegal.
Exactly, it's not.
Wake up.
She has to justify her job.
The normal hematocrit level for a woman is 37-48%.
But levels normally remain stable.
Could an altitude tent alone explain the large gaps in irregularities observed in Ms. Arseneau?
Probably not.
- Thank you.
- Thank you.
Anything to be on TV.
- Are we eating?
- Yes.
What irregularities?
In six years of racing, I've had tons of blood tests.
They could have made mistakes.
- Due to your anemia.
- But what tent?
- We got one in Arizona.
- Didn't you see it in the garage?
Why haven't we heard about it before?
What the hell?
Are you a cop now?
- No one tells me anything.
- lt's tech stuff, Mom.
It's like me.
I've tried to keep up, but...
And remember, reporters aren't all experts.
A lot of bullshit's coming.
When the users' names come out, they'll let us be.
Fucking Dr. Henri.
I'd love two minutes with him.
Two minutes?
The bastard.
I never liked his face.
Never mind Dr. Henri.
Go get us that World Cup.
That'll shut them up.
In two days, this will be old news.
Drop it.
No one answers their phone. I got this.
But it's the Federation.
- Don't answer, Dad.
- Hello?
He should be here soon.
Can we start without him?
The Federation isn't at ease with renewing your licence.
I don't understand.
The irregularities...
Dr. Henri...
Dr. Henri... that was resolved at the press conference.
Not for us.
We're uneasy.
The Federation doesn't have the authority.
As long as you refuse to see a sports doctor, my hands are tied.
It's the World Cup Final.
François, we've put you on the map.
You've gotten great exposure.
And you're doing this over a sports doctor?
We can't grant a licence unless doping has been completely ruled out.
- Says who?
- l'm just following protocol.
You can't do this to me.
It's ridiculous.
I'm sorry.
OK.
Supposing we do see a sports doctor, would she get her licence in time?
Probably, but it's not guaranteed.
What does that mean?
We're going there to win the Cup, and you can't guarantee she'll have it for the race?
!
Julie!
Julie.
What was that?
- l'm going home.
- We're going to see his doctor.
- No.
- What then?
- Nothing. I've done nothing wrong.
- So let's see his doctor.
- l won't.
Why did you answer the phone?
Claude told you not to.
What will Claude think when he finds out?
We do what François says, then it's done.
He has no right to ask.
He's not the one asking.
After all I've done for you, I'm asking.
You have no right, either!
What am I supposed to do?
Give them my file?
- Why not?
- You know exactly why not.
No, I don't know.
Seriously, Dad?
You really suck.
You piss me off.
Where are you going?
You have a race in ten days.
Where is she going?
Will someone tell me what's going on?
Alain, do something.
We can't let her go like this.
- What was that about?
- What do you think?
Why are you giving me that look?
- l don't know.
I can't buy some at the duty-free shop.
You're not trying.
You're not trying at all.
- lt's not my fault, it's windy.
- lt'll be windy in Belgium.
I know that, JP.
Your race on Mount Royal, that was kid stuff.
Small time.
Over there, the last kilometre is the Wall of Huy, a 23% slope.
23!
So shut up and pedal.
Fuck.
What's going on?
- lt's windy.
- No.
What's going on?
I don't know.
Maybe I'm overwhelmed.
By what?
By what?
!
Everything.
I get it, it sucks.
But you have to get over it and move on.
Easy for you to say.
You're never there when the shit hits the fan.
You're crazy!
I'm not even at 30.
Stop it!
I set the cruise control at 35.
- That's enough!
- Pedal.
- Turn off your cruise control!
- Go.
It's fucking dangerous!
Only because you're not moving.
It's not my fault.
It's windy.
OK.
Fine.
Figure things out.
Let me know when you're ready.
JP!
We're in the middle of nowhere!
Fuck.
She'll have her licence.
Definitely.
What can I say?
Welcome to the States.
No jerking around.
You happy?
So quit fighting.
Why bother with that?
Forget it.
Once we've won, they'll shut their traps.
And us, what do you think?
Here she is.
It's your dad.
Alain, she's in the shower.
What's your problem?
You look beautiful.
I can't believe Dr. Henri never mentioned this.
It gives the exact hematocrit level.
What's the big deal?
I can avoid irregularities.
OK.
Let's say you check your level.
You're at 49.
Then the anti-doping guy is at the door.
It didn't help much.
But I can keep it under 48.
You'll still have irregularities.
With smaller gaps.
If you say so.
- Look. 45.
- Show me.
Right, 45.
That there is one nice irregularity.
Go to hell.
It's completely stupid.
- No, it isn't.
- Yes, it is.
You're camping tonight.
No way, I'm not sleeping in there.
That's stupid.
- You're camping.
- What a waste of money.
Go.
You can do it.
Push!
Push!
Push!
You can do it.
Harder!
Faster or I'll catch you.
Don't even try.
See you at the van.
Really?
Not if I get there first.
What's wrong?
I think I took too much.
I don't feel good.
It's just nerves.
JP, my heart stopped beating.
It's beating.
Sleep.
Come to bed.
JP.
I need a hospital.
Breathe.
Keep breathing.
My blood is too thick. I can feel it.
Get on the bike.
You have to pedal.
Get on.
- l can't.
- Get on.
- l can't.
- Pedal. lt has to go down.
It has to go down.
There.
Pedal.
Go.
Pedal!
You have to burn the surplus.
Fifty-six.
Holy shit, Julie.
What did you do?
The hospital!
Did you take 500 or 200?
Get on.
Good.
Go.
Don't fall.
It's OK.
Look at me.
- JP.
- lt's OK.
I'm going to die...
Here.
Good.
- l'm going to die.
You're not going to die.
Keep going.
Go.
You feeling better?
Yes?
Dad.
It's me.
Yes.
Where are you?
Have you guys left?
Not yet.
I... I need to talk to you.
JP told me about the licence.
He sure knows his stuff.
For sure.
Everything OK?
Yes.
I was just calling...
To see how things are going.
Good.
That's nice.
We'll see you there?
Yes.
OK, Dad.
OK.
Liège, Belgium
Room 51 1 1 .
- May I have another key?
- Of course.
Ms. Arseneau?
Hello. I'm Gilbert Lennel from WADA.
We need a blood sample.
Please follow me.
No problem.
Hey.
- Hi.
You good?
When did you arrive?
- Yesterday.
We were wondering where you guys were.
- We had things to take care of.
- l can imagine.
- How are the girls?
- Good.
Why?
You know it's all a smear campaign.
Yeah.
We watched the press conference.
Doesn't change a thing for you guys.
Sure.
But it still sucks.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Are you sleeping at the hotel?
What about your tent?
- Jessica.
- Can't I make a joke?
The truck is ready.
Let's go, girls.
- Shotgun.
- Eat shit.
You're heading towards the Wall.
Julie should be in the lead pack.
Valerie, protect Julie.
Anyone else who can, do the same.
Do what you can until the Chicane, then it's time.
Then, Julie, it'll be in your hands.
It'll be tough, but you can do this.
Why did you hug the inner curb?
It was obviously going to screw us up.
- They shoved you over like...
- A fucking amateur.
- What?
- Put a lid on the bickering.
Valerie did the best climbing.
Julie, keep up.
And go easy.
You're not even halfway up, yet.
Go back down and get it right.
I don't believe this.
Taking a bend is pretty basic.
I'm starving.
What are you eating?
- l'm not hungry.
- Get over it.
Bad day.
Tomorrow will be better.
No big deal.
We're having a drink later.
Feel free to come.
Room 5064.
Cool.
Thanks.
You thinking of going?
No.
Do you want people to think you're a lesbian?
No. I wasn't planning on going.
Are you hiding something?
What does the butch want with you, anyway?
You look beautiful.
You can't stay.
Sleep in your room.
Girls, I'm back.
Who wants some?
It's too hard for Canadians.
Just kidding!
Do you want a drink?
You need Belgian thighs!
To climb the Wall!
I'm so glad you came.
Really cool.
Julie, come play.
Take the paddle.
Give me your drink.
Everyone, the Champion is playing!
- Just hit it.
- You can do it.
- What the hell are you doing?
- Where were you?
Nowhere.
Partying with the Belgians?
I was playing Wii.
What did the butch want?
I'm talking to you.
What did the butch want?
Bitch.
Let go!
When did you stop?
The fucking vials are full.
- l'm scared!
- When did you stop?
- A couple of days ago.
- You fucking idiot!
I can win clean!
What the fuck, Julie?
Clean?
They're built like goons and they're gonna destroy you.
is that clean?
Nobody gets to the podium clean.
Clean, you come in twelfth!
Take an extra dose today and tomorrow.
You should be fine for the race.
It's too soon.
You don't care about losing, then?
If you stop the stuff, you'll stop winning!
And what will everyone think?
"Minor doping scandal and, oops, she stops winning."
Fucking brilliant.
No more sponsors, money, nothing.
We're screwed.
I'm scared I'll die.
What are you doing?
- None of this is yours.
Equipment.
Clothes.
Even the bike belongs to Team Vita.
Leave my things alone.
You don't care?
Fine.
I'll find someone who does.
Stop. lt isn't funny.
Enjoy your new day job, you crazy bitch.
You never finished high school.
Let's go.
C'mon, girls!
Keep going.
Keep tight together in the wind.
The pace is too slow.
OK, Valerie attack.
Valerie, I said:
Attack!
- What about me?
- Valerie is attacking.
It's the same plan, but with Valerie attacking.
It isn't complicated.
Go!
Fuck.
Who is it?
- lt's Marie-Eve.
Are you OK?
Yes, I'm fine.
What JP did was wrong.
I...
We're sorry.
It's fine.
Julie?
Don't put up with it.
You're really good.
I don't know.
Maybe...
There are other coaches.
Other teams.
Would it be better if Valerie were lead?
No, I didn't...
Sure would be convenient...
What did she promise you?
- What are you talking about?
- Save your breath.
Hello?
Already?
I injected myself earlier.
Bravo.
A dose and a half.
Why are you telling me now?
Isn't that what you wanted?
OK.
You know what?
I'm not going to play your little game.
I'm here to make you win, OK?
That's why you pay me.
You pay me 50% to make you win.
It's no small feat.
What I do must be worth something.
But now, you're playing the victim.
Before Dr. Henri ratted you out, you were happy to inject yourself and stand on podiums.
Don't pretend you're trying to make me happy.
I don't want you to feel anything.
I don't want to stop, either.
I told you.
I'm scared.
You're done being scared.
It's over.
- What's over?
- lt's over!
I can't want it for you.
Look at you go.
The other girls would kill to win this race.
But not you.
No way.
Do you have makeup?
You look like shit.
You'll freak out your parents.
Are you sure you're fine?
- Yes, Mom.
- Nervous for the big day?
It's all right.
I'm hungry, let's eat mussels.
It's on me.
I can't. I have too much work.
And I have to train.
Take some time to eat.
It'll do you good.
He's a French specialist who's followed top athletes with irregularities.
He's proven it wasn't doping.
He's exactly the guy we need.
Some more white.
Your father hasn't stopped.
It's really nice, but...
Money isn't an issue.
Vita will pay for all medical procedures.
If we have to go overseas, we'll go.
But it's OK now, I have my licence.
We'd like you to see a doctor.
Settle this once and for all.
You're not in this alone.
People stare at us too.
Co-workers, and especially neighbours.
Thank you.
Reporters won't stop.
If you saw a specialist, it would shut everybody up.
You have nothing to lose.
What is it?
Why don't you want to go?
Of course I'll go.
Give me his number.
I'll take care of it.
It's already booked.
- Where are JP and Valerie?
- We don't know.
- lt's an easy question.
Where?
- Chill out.
- Relax.
- Don't worry, I'm not after your JP.
- You think you're good.
- Stop acting up.
Acting up?
She's never done a thing.
She's been touring for ten years, winning off of others...
Now she thinks she can win.
You'll be crushed.
You don't have what it takes.
Being second is easy.
But will you do what it takes to win?
Like suck the coach's cock?
is that it?
Let go.
Let me go, fuck!
You want to stop?
Why?
I'm fed up.
Julie.
You're about to win the World Cup, and you want to stop?
What's wrong?
I'm burnt out.
I'm tired.
That's why we want you to see a doctor.
Would you stop bringing that up?
You know why I don't want to see one.
No, we don't.
Dad.
Stop.
You were there, with me at Dr. Henri's.
Why...
Why are you bringing this up?
It was six years ago.
Why bring it up now?
What do you think Dr. Henri sold us?
You were sick, Julie.
So what?
It doesn't change what we bought.
It was once.
Six years ago.
Calm down, Alain.
You were sick. lt was a one-time thing.
Just stop it.
That's what we always said.
Did you keep taking it, Julie?
I'm sorry.
I'm just tired.
Then that means everything is all right.
Everything is all right.
You're not on anything.
I'm not on anything.
Swear.
It's all right, OK?
You're right.
I'll race tomorrow.
I can't stop now.
Julie, swear you're on nothing.
I swear.
It's what we always said.
Julie.
I've been looking for you.
That was quite a punch.
She had it coming, the hypocrite.
As if I'd ever replace you with Valerie.
She'd have no qualms stealing your place.
But I know who my star is.
I did it to get you back.
And it worked.
Look at you.
The beast has risen.
Thanks.
Thank you
- Thanks.
Less than five minutes to start time.
There are only a few teams left to check in before they head to the start line.
Team USA is now being presented to the crowd.
Cynthia, fueling up is at Kilometre 40 and 80.
Jess, Marie-Eve, protect Julie on flat terrain.
Less than a minute...
Just so it's clear with everyone...
Valerie, we're doing the initial plan.
Julie leads.
You help her.
Good luck.
Start time in less than thirty seconds.
Three, two, one.
The Fleche Wallonne has begun!
After the race, we'll stop messing around, OK?
I'm going to do what it takes.
I'll talk to Nathalie.
- What?
- l'll get a divorce.
We'll really be together.
Are you happy?
We're at Kilometre 25.
The peloton is in the plains.
Where is she?
It's making me nervous.
I don't like it.
Sometimes, I'm afraid I'll lose you.
I'm so afraid you'll quit.
That you'll quit on me.
Julie, where are you?
Julie?
What's wrong?
Can anyone hear me?
- Yes.
- Yes.
- Yes.
Julie?
Jess?
Cynthia?
is Julie with you?
No.
She's behind.
I'm near her.
Your earpiece is off.
- l lost it.
- She lost her earpiece.
- Give her yours.
- She's gone.
- Gone where?
Toward Valerie.
I can't catch up.
- Valerie?
Are you with Julie?
- Yes.
Give her your earpiece.
No.
If I tell you to give it, then you fucking give it.
Simple.
I'm done coddling your princess, so too bad.
They're zipping through Andenne.
The leaders of the peloton are quickening the pace.
We won't let them get ahead.
Let's go.
The French cyclist Catherine Moranger is trying to escape.
She's breaking away and is now in the lead.
What the hell is going on?
!
I see everyone but our girl.
Calm down, Alain. lt's not even midway, yet.
No, it's... I got it.
It's only coffee.
Are you part of the break?
- We're in front with Valerie.
- What for?
It's too early.
- We're following Valerie.
Would you follow her off a bridge?
I'll come when the gong hits.
- Your damn coffee.
- Not my fault.
Then I suppose it's mine.
We mustn't ruin your nice shirt.
No.
We mustn't ruin my nice shirt.
Not today.
At Kilometre 40, the gap is widening.
Suzanne.
Permission to move ahead to join my team as soon as possible, please.
Team Vita, permission granted.
Cynthia, go back to Julie.
See if she needs fuel.
Do yourjob!
Gotta do my job...
Do you need fuel?
Cynthia, I'm right behind you.
Come talk to me.
Julie ignored me.
Marie-Eve needs water.
What are you doing?
Valerie is pushing us for nothing.
She's unplugged herself, so she can't hear.
It's a mess. lt's all fucked up.
- Help Julie.
- She's working alone.
She doesn't want help.
I'm done with her.
Where's Valerie?
We're nearing Kilometre 60.
There are two pelotons divided by a 55-second gap.
Moranger is still in the lead.
- l'm alone.
Let's team up.
- For how long?
Until the Wall.
Then you're on our own.
OK.
Hello?
With who?
Fine.
After that, the deal's over.
OK.
Bravo!
Bravo!
You're doing such a great job,
Julie's with the Belgian butch.
You're all fucking incompetent.
Next year, find yourselves another team.
You're all useless!
Fucking hell!
We're at Kilometre 80 and nothing has changed.
It's down to a 30-second gap.
In the lead, Moranger from France,
Team Vita's Valerie Morin,
Sandrine Bruquelle from Belgium, and Miriam Bosquet from France.
She's unwell and burned out.
It's stress.
She wanted to quit.
It's normal before a race.
You wouldn't let a child quit school.
You say no.
But we did let her quit school.
An attack at Kilometre 90.
Two racers have left the tail bunch.
They're trying to catch up to the leaders.
If you leave,
I'll die.
I'll kill myself.
You don't know how much I love you.
Say you love me.
I love you.
Come on.
Come on, goddamit.
Canadian Julie Arseneau from Team Vita and number 51 , Belgian Renalda Ducros, are closing in on the leaders past Kilometre 1 00.
Go!
I know you can do it.
Do it!
Numbers 31 and 51 have caught up to the leaders.
We've reached it.
The Wall of Huy, a gruelling ordeal.
This is where true climbers prove what they're made of.
Welcome to the merciless Chicane, where it's a hit or miss.
World Cup leader Julie Arseneau is moving away from longtime rival Renalda Ducros.
Final sprint, 1 00 meters from the finish line.
Julie Arseneau is ahead.
She's over the finish line!
It's a victory for Canadian Julie Arseneau, the new World Cup Champion, with Renalda Ducros in second and Catherine Moranger in third.
What an incredible race.
Ms. Arseneau?
Please follow me for your test.
I'm coming.
Champagne!
Champagne!
Marie-Eve!
Valerie!
Come here.
This champagne is amazing.
Here.
We sure do deserve it.
- l hope there's more than one case.
- Me, too.
- More.
More.
- l'm so emotional.
- Tonight we're allowed.
- Yes.
- Did you fall during the race?
- No.
- Poor you.
What happened?
- lt was while playing Wii.
It feels weird. I knew you'd win.
But it just hasn't sunk in, yet.
It hasn't sunk in for me, either.
The World Cup.
The World Cup!
- My little girl.
- The waiting is over.
We told you there'd be a bonus if you won.
Here it is.
Open it.
Go on.
Damn...
Not bad, huh?
I don't believe it.
- Cheers!
- You said it.
- To Julie.
- Cheers!
- With this cheque, I can finally retire.
- Come on!
I'm just kidding.
Are you happy, Julie?
- Of course I am, Mom.
- l can barely keep it in.
If it were up to me...
The sky's the limit!
The Olympics...
Name it!
Can we savour this victory first?
I haven't said a word.
News travels fast.
It's André from La Presse.
So?
Wasn't it beautiful?
Wasn't she amazing?
- You betcha!
Who told you that?
You didn't get tested after the race?
I forgot.
You've been disqualified.
What did you do?
I forgot.
It isn't something you forget.
I'm sorry.
Yes.
Exactly.
Disqualified.

Everyone's having a great time!
Chocolate after all.
too!
It's so expensive!
Everything is more expensive than yesterday.
I guess everyone's thinking the same thing.
Serara...
Nyanta!
Is something wrong?
No...
Um... is it?
It's a southern fruit used to make all kinds of things like sweets and drinks.
really?
though.
And People of the Land have a legend about them.
If you get the one you love to eat them your love will be returned.
today was Valentine's Day.
Th-That's right.
I have things to do!
Meow... 1)}2.14 A Sweet Trap
2.14 A Sweet Trap.
Master Naotsugu please train me again today!
sorry.
I have something to do today.
right?
Yeah.
it's Valentine's Day... huh?
Come to think of it we were once put through serious hell over that.
right?
Shiroe?
So was I.
And get off me.
I heard Kanami was the leader of the Party.
And she was beautiful and everyone loved her...
And she was older than you.
could she be...
Your girlfriend?
What are you talking about?
It wasn't like that.
right?
I've never heard this.
exactly?
It's written all over your face!
is freaking out.
It is not.
Liar!
You can't fool me!
Could she really be his love?
Older than he is?
Broad-minded?
Tetra... have a little modesty.
A girl will wilt if she doesn't have good food and tales of love.
has Master Naotsugu really not realized that Tetra is a guy?
Seems that way.
though!
Should I tell him?
I'm not sure what to do.
Is it "Miss Tetra" or "Mr. Tetra"?
And I'm not sure if it'd be "Big Sis Tetra" or "Big Bro Tetra.
Brother
Sister Brother
What are you talking about?
Big Sibro Tetra!
Sibro"?
Crap!
I combined "Sis" and "Bro"!
we were talking about what it would be best to call you.
That's an easy one.
Just call me "Tetra"!
I figured it wouldn't work.
Isuzu.
Rare?
What brings you here?
I wanted to use these to make some sweets.
Are these coconia fruits?
Yeah.
I don't really mean anything by it but I'm thinking of making some for Rudy.
my.
But I'm not a cook.
Then why don't we make them together?
they turn into gel...
I've got the perfect item.
1)}Newlywed's Apron Dress
The Newlywed's Apron Dress.
I'll lend it to you.
Oh!
In exchange for a temporary level drop it gives you a moderate cooking sub-skill.
Wow!
Even I'll be able to cook!
It looks great on you.
Chief?
It was a quest reward.
then.
Since you've professed that you're not a good cook
I'll start by teaching you how to make simple sweets.
peel the coconia fruits and and then boil them.
Once you can stick a toothpick clean through move them to a bowl and mash them with a spatula while they're still warm.
the taste will be much smoother.
I see!
then butter and mix them up.
Once they've cooled roll them into balls with your hands and brush on some egg yolk.
Then put them into an oven warmed with salamander heat and cook them until they turn brown.
And you've got sweet potato-style coconia.
It smells so good!
I'll go give them to Rudy before they get cold.
Chief!
then...
It's still early in the day.
I guess I'll clean.
so I'd like to give Shiroe a present.
it'd be embarrassing... that'd be even worse.
it's just to thank him.
Could she be...
Your girlfriend?
Kanami... there!
did you need something?
aren't you?
Wh-What are you talking about?
You're so easy to read.
Why not make it clear?
no.
exactly?
Here.
It's called a coconia fruit.
They say it has a special effect on Valentine's Day.
A special effect?
Here!
Look at the flavor text!
Coconia Fruit.
A southern fruit such as making various dishes and drinks.
If you feed them to someone on Valentine's Day you may find out who they heart-heart.
What does that mean?
right?
Which means you might figure out who Shiroe loves.
Wouldn't it be better to find out rather than sit here alone and suffer?
Bye!
Coconia fruit...
Coconia fruit!
Even if you have stat boosts from the item you're still doing quite well at this.
after all.
Girls?
Wh-Who is she making them for?
It's been six weeks since the magic circle protecting Akihabara vanished.
It's more peaceful than I expected.
Akihabara was always a place for high-level adventurers.
No monster would willingly wander in and any that did were wiped out immediately.
either.
Eins was really worried
We Have {\cH3256CA}Chocolate!
when the Royal Guard system went out of whack but it's actually working out.
we need to keep an eye out to ensure that no People of the Land get hurt.
the combat guilds are taking shifts to handle that.
That's right.
who's on duty today?
I think.
I haven't seen them.
of all days...
Soujirou!
Leave Your Valentine's Day Chocolate Here
Please accept this as a sign of my love!
I was here first!
I was!
Sou!
okay.
Stay in line.
Thanks.
okay?
thank you!
no cutting!
Crusty's been missing ever since that day.
where is that monster?
And what is he doing?
he could come back right away.
why are you in such sloppy dress again?
It's past noon.
I don't have any public duties today.
That isn't the problem.
It's important to remember your station.
so I used something else.
have some.
Elissa.
Honestly... anyway?
It's sweet and delicious!
Well?
I feel like I'm getting the hang of it.
I'm glad.
but...
I'll look for ingredients that don't put so much stress on the body.
We at Radio Market are working with the Roderic Merchant Guild on it.
Don't worry.
It'll work.
Thank you.
But where did my right arm go?
From the fact that healing magic doesn't work we can be certain it isn't a type of damage that was in the old game.
wherever he is.
this is a very extraordinary case.
Don't worry.
Just focus on getting better.
I'll work super hard until my lord returns!
thanks.
My lord...
Nyanta!
so I bought a lot.
I bet they weren't cheap at all.
Nyanta!
Yes?
Since Shiroe is always so good to me
I wanted to make something for him...
Meow?
N-Not like that!
It's nothing special!
I understand how you feel.
I'd be glad to help.
Nyanta... master.
I've returned from a training quest.
I just happened so...
You just happened to get all those?
I wanted to make my lord some...
Minori?
Akatsuki?
too.
For my lord?
Look how beaten up she got.
Does she also...
Wh-What a problem.
This is one of the worst things to happen in Log Horizon's history.
man.
This is too funny.
They're rivals in love.
then!
why not work together?
You're both after the same thing.
Work together?
but I only have one Newlywed's Apron Dress.
Look!
I got one from Marielle!
please teach me.
Fast!
too.
All right.
Go!
Go!
Maidens!
But remember that I'm the center of the galaxy!
That's strange...
Where did Rudy go?
well.
I'll head back.
Sorry for keeping you.
Naotsugu!
right?
Y-Yeah.
So...
So...
I made you a present!
Candy!
Thanks.
I...
Um...
I've been thinking...
You have that cute girl in your guild now.
but...
What kind of girl is your type?
O...
O"?
O...
Original style?
Pa...
Pa"?
...nti—
Naotsugu?
!
A new type of Royal Guard system?
Akatsuki?
it looked like you vanished.
You imagined it.
I swear...
Naotsugu's such a jerk!
there must be better ways to do it!
Shouryuu?
Hi.
right.
Want some candy?
I made too much.
For me?
Bye.
I-It still makes me happy!
I'm back!
I'm back.
What the hell was that about?
What's wrong?
out of nowhere.
Welcome back.
That looks good!
Let me take a—
It's not for you!
This is an offering from us to my lord.
For me?
That's right.
These two made this special cake for you.
They made it?
You mean they cooked it?
Indeed.
I gave them the necessary items and helped a little.
That was all.
too.
Come on!
Sit down.
Stare.
What is going on here?
And I have mild trauma when it comes to cakes.
hurry.
Please taste it.
Y-Yeah.
I'll try it.
This is...
It's good!
All right!
Akatsuki?
Yeah.
Meow?
This is it!
This is the Valentine's Day-only effect of the coconia fruit.
He'll answer anything we ask him now!
quickly!
But what should I ask?
Who he likes?
If it's Akatsuki...
No!
I'm too scared to ask!
What if he says "Kanami"?
anyway?
It's no use.
I can't do it.
that Rudy...
I never did find him.
And I spent all day training.
I'm so hungry...
I'm starved.
What's for dinner tonight?
I like curry!
we all know that.
Why say it?
Did I say something?
That's right.
then.
huh?
But you know...
This may have been for the best.
This is for me?
Yes.
and I thought they were pretty.
I was going to make him some sweets 209)}Coconia but coconia fruits were all sold out.
And I couldn't find a Newlywed's Apron Dress anywhere...
These flowers have thorns.
Did you pick them just for me?
I'm very grateful.
by the way.
Why not join us?
Can I?
Of course.
Thank you!
I'll help!
I would appreciate that.
Okay!
I'm back.
Where the heck have you been all day?
sorry...
I had something to do.
whatever.
Here.
What is this?
Sweet potato-style coconia fruit.
try one.
That was nice of you.
I'll try one.
This is great!
Miss Isuzu.
Good!
Huh?
Er...
Rudy?
I love you all!
I see.
So it isn't limited to romantic love.
Big Bro Rudy.
I see!
I see!
What's gotten into them?
No idea.
Shiro...
Nureha...
You're not using your bed again.
Intix?
Were you thinking about Shiroe?
Were you?
Don't talk about him.
I told you.
didn't I?
He's no good.
He's a man who can't be connected to any group.
He isn't even a player.
Just powerful interference.
He is not a man you can have.
He's just a traitor.
But he is smart.
You could say he's fastidious.
So he knows the smell of the gutter.
Do you honestly think anyone will ever care about you?
and ugly you are?
Stop it!
You're covered in lies.
There isn't the tiniest bit of truth in you.
Once someone gets to know you they'll find your past smells worse than a sewer.
who just kept staring longingly at us with that creepy smile...
Stop it!
Please understand.
Don't be arrogant enough to think that someone like you could ever be connected to anyone.
I'm the only one who would make a contract with a filthy woman like you.
You're the perfect princess for looking at from a distance.
Please realize that things aren't like they were when this was your salon.
Not here in Plant Hwyaden.
You'll collect lots of wooden dolls and make yourself a castle.
And I will gain the entire Yamato server.
right?
aren't you?
The Council of Ten Seats is about to begin.
you're only a figurehead so just come if you feel like it.
No.
Not anymore
Intix.
It isn't just about my contract with you.
I...
I can give you what you want more easily as a foe than a friend.
whenever you decide to find a reason.
I have a promise!
This is the China server.
The chaos of the Apocalypse continues across the world.
and fights to protect the people.
She is the former leader of the Debauchery Tea Party.
Her name is...
Go East.
Go East
I have friends to run with me.
Previously on Revenge...
- You set me up!
- I'm sorry.
I know it was you, Daniel.
I'm not going anywhere.
- We can build a future together.
- This is my future.
You're ending this with me?
I thought I could avenge my father's death by myself, but I can't.
I need you to help me.
Conrad is suing Voulez for libel.
I'm willing to drop my suit just as soon as you fire my son.
- If you think we're going to cave to your threats--
- I'll do it.
Jimmy Brennan?
Heard of him?
If I'm to believe what's in this police report, he may also go by "Dad."
- What did Jimmy Brennan do to you?
- He kisses me.
When I try to pull away, he pushes my face into the concrete.
I was expecting to see the former governor's wife.
I'm the first Mrs. Grayson.
- Are you okay?
- Since my head injury,
I'm getting a little dizzy sometimes.
You were marvelous last night, Mrs. Grayson.
Of all the weapons we take into battle, there is none more powerful than the mind.
It holds our instincts and our training and allows us to distinguish friend from foe, love from hate.
Hold perfectly still, Mrs. Grayson.
But if that weapon is unsound, it is by no means disarmed.
For the mind is all the more dangerous when damaged.
And there's no guarantee that it won't choose itself as its next victim.
Physically, you've recovered beyond expectation.
With regard to your head trauma, there are no permanent neurological problems evident.
However, there is a bit of swelling between the frontal and the left temporal lobes.
Would that explain the pounding in my ears, the blackouts?
I'm not a neurologist, Emily.
But the lab forwarded the results to one.
He'll have a better analysis for you tomorrow.
And until then, what do I do?
I...
I could be a risk to myself, to others.
Given your state of mind, maybe talking with someone would help.
At the least, it may help you remember what happened.
Because you still can't recall anything, right?
I'm glad to see I am still welcome.
I thought you'd have changed the locks by now.
Well, I have more important things on my mind than your departure, Conrad.
As have I while I've been staying at the South Fork.
I can only imagine what you've been up to.
Aside from having our son fired for your amusement, I mean.
Actually...
I've come to care about my new venture.
And, so that I may approach it with a clear mind,
I wanted to pop by in anticipation of convening our attorneys to cement our divorce tomorrow.
Oh, I assume, as always, my house will be the first thing you'll fight me over.
Why infringe on the beautiful memories of our first divorce by retreading the same duels during our second one?
Mrs. Grayson, there's been a fire at the gallery.
I still don't think we should have let ourselves in.
Ah, the realtor was late.
Besides, I needed to check for security issues.
Using break-in skills I was unaware of.
Oh, my account manager just quit.
That's the third person to leave since they heard of Conrad's maneuver.
Do not say "I told you so."
I'm taking the wait-and-see approach.
That's what I did when Conrad bought into the bar last year.
This is just to hurt Daniel.
Not me.
All right, look.
No more Conrad talk.
I don't want to bring in bad mojo right off the bat, 'cause...
I think this might be the place.
But you've only seen two houses.
I know, but my dad said that when you're looking, the first one you like is the one you should buy.
Though...
Are you sure you'd want to live here?
I know it's nowhere near what you're accustomed to.
I came here to start a new life and to leave the one I'd grown accustomed to in France far behind.
Since it's my birthday tomorrow and you probably forgot again,
I decided I'd just tell you what to get me.
Okay, guilty as charged.
So you name it, and it's yours.
I was rejected from the design institute.
I thought I had a shot, but I guess they thought I lacked experience.
So I was hoping you could find something for me at Voulez.
You want my job?
'Cause it's available.
Seems there's no end to Dad's insecurity.
He got me fired and took my stake in the magazine.
I'm so sorry, Daniel.
At least use it to your advantage.
I guarantee he'll flex his sagging muscles to help you.
But you know what?
I'd rather spend my time throwing you an epic birthday party.
You can't pull all that together in one day.
You deserve it, Sis.
After all, seems pretty clear it's me and you against the world.
What happened?
I came here last night to work, try to deal with what you told me, and I, uh...
Well, I got so upset that I, uh...
This is my fault.
I'm sorry.
No.
No, no, no.
It's my fault.
You should go, though, all right?
Let me deal with this.
No.
We're in this together.
Wow.
Somebody really did a number on this place, huh?
I'm Jimmy Brennan, the contractor you called.
I don't know how you heard about me.
It must've been good, right?
Hey.
Are those Aiden's?
Where's he going?
Wherever he tells my jet to take him.
Is he here?
Since I knew you were coming over,
I told him to scram.
I didn't want to confuse an already confusing situation.
Did you want to say goodbye to him?
No.
It's probably best this way, especially since I don't know what I'm doing half the time.
Which brings us to why you wanted twelve hours of South Fork security-cam footage.
Okay.
Here you are on the phone.
Any idea who you were talking to?
No.
Well, I bet Conrad does.
Picks up in the hallway.
You go in.
Conrad leaves.
At least he was a gentleman.
He didn't come back till 7:00.
When I woke up.
What is going on with you, Ems?
Blackouts?
Colluding with Conrad?
My C.A.T. scan showed swelling.
When that goes down, I'm sure whatever this is will stop.
Yeah, but is that what the doctor told you or what you wanted to hear?
She's sending my results to a specialist.
Maybe you should talk to a therapist.
You know I can't risk telling a stranger the truth.
Yeah, but isn't that a risk you're already taking?
I have survived on my own this long.
Trust me.
I can handle it.
You sure about that?
Who do you know in Los Angeles?
- Hello?
- Emily?
Stevie Grayson.
- It's nice to talk to you again.
- Yeah?
I'm in town, and I'm ready to process your divorce.
I begged you to leave well enough alone.
Yeah, that was before you told me what happened --
Before you told me that you were forced to sacrifice me, move across the ocean to stay away from that guy.
And I spent my life building a world to escape what he did.
And now he is in our space.
- I should never have told you what happened.
- Why?
So I wouldn't find out what a monster he was?
Or that I'm a child of rape?
- I'm gonna kill him.
- Patrick.
Please...
Don't do anything.
If I lost you because of that man...
You are the one good thing that came out of the worst time of my life.
It's why I hold you so dear.
Now, I want you to fire that man now.
- All right.
Okay.
- All right.
Got it.
Charlotte loves his music.
You really think you can get him?
For Daniel Grayson, I'll clone him if I have to.
Ah, there she is.
Larissa, this is my wife, Emily.
Daniel's told me everything you've been through.
You're lucky to have such a strong man by your side.
- You have no idea.
- Oh, I might.
He's pulling out all the stops for this birthday party.
For Charlotte?
That's nice of you, Daniel.
I do all I can for the people I love.
I'm gonna go check out where the band should set up.
Okay.
All right.
I heard you, uh -- you didn't come home last night.
I'm surprised you care, especially after you man-handled me.
Something I know you'll regret.
No, the only thing I'll regret is my marriage to you.
Because publishing my memoirs in serial form will only help to increase our circulation.
And with my pedigree, I can guarantee that Mr. LeMarchal will see us as something far more than a curiosity which lies an ocean away.
Wouldn't you agree, Margaux?
I need to speak to Conrad alone.
Now.
You have no right holding a creative meeting without me.
Oh, I can't help it if you're house hunting while I'm settling in.
I run things around here.
And not my father, as you seem to be implying.
You are absolutely correct.
He controls an international media empire.
Mm-hmm, which is why you're wasting your time hoping he'll care about this magazine.
Or maybe you just don't know how to get his attention.
- Emily?
- Yes.
- Stevie Grayson.
- Nice to meet you.
I thought it best that we meet someplace out of the way.
- Let's take a booth.
- Yeah.
I always like hiding out in this Stowaway.
I knew we'd get along great.
I used to come here years ago.
- Well, thank you for coming again.
- You kidding?
I've handled over a thousand divorces.
Nothing compares to a Grayson man.
Only they could get me to cross the country for a kindred spirit.
So, down to business.
Do you want to stick with the terms you suggested on the phone last night?
Well, um, now that you've had the night to sleep on it, I, well --
I think I'd rather get your opinion.
Obviously,
Daniel cheating in your residence is grounds for annulment -- slam dunk.
You know, I --
I don't know if I can go through with this.
Daniel and I -- yes, we've been having a hard time.
But...
Maybe I'm overreacting.
You know, I think we could work it out.
Really?
Last night, you were convinced otherwise.
In fact, you went as far to say that you were also in love with someone else.
No.
It's just Daniel.
Okay.
You can tell me whatever you want.
That look in your eyes...
Is a look of love, and not for the man you married.
I can't lose you.
Not to my plan or to Niko.
No, Emily.
Emily.
You can't do this now.
What is wrong with you?
Let go!
Look, I have to go.
If you want to have a sensible conversation...
I'll call you from London, but this isn't happening.
Have you been told where we're going?
What the hell are you doing, Niko?
Avenging my father, like I said I would.
You didn't think I'd find this under your bed?
Speechless?
That's funny, Aiden.
Because you knew exactly what to say when you showed up in Japan.
And when you tried to send me to Russia to kill someone for a crime you committed.
I can't believe I nursed my father's murderer back to health.
I didn't murder him.
We fought like warriors.
He attacked me, and I defended.
A death was inevitable.
I wanted to tell you, and one day, I would have.
But you had to help Emily first.
That was the code your father taught us.
- We go where we're needed.
- Oh, I'm counting on it.
I left her a clue just to see if she was really as good as he claimed.
And when she shows up here to save you,
I'm gonna kill her.
What?
You took someone I love on this spot.
You can watch while I do the same.
We'll tell him $5,000 a month in child support, another $5,000 in alimony, and --
Know what?
Uh...
I am back tomorrow.
Just sit tight.
I should have known you were behind this, Conrad.
So I assume Emily's whole divorce story was a sham?
Oh, no.
No.
Quite the contrary.
Emily would be wise to rid herself of my son.
That said...
I am glad you've come, especially as we're neighbors.
You're living in a hotel?
Yeah, while Emily's chosen to not follow through with her inevitable divorce, that hasn't stopped me from proceeding with my own.
And are you planning on treating Victoria as horribly as you did me?
Actually, that's why I'm here.
You know, I regret the way I handled things back then and would like this chance to make my sincere amends.
Hmm.
You know, I want you to read this.
I believe it makes ample restitution for my misdeeds...
With the added benefit of giving Victoria
- her overdue comeuppance.
- Hmm.
There was a period in my life when I would have wanted nothing more.
But there's one problem.
I'm happy now.
Oh, well...
Why don't you give that time?
That always changes.
Yeah, most of my crew's on another job.
But I couldn't pass up the chance to slap Grayson on my client list.
Yeah.
Hey, you got the power cut?
Uh...
There you go.
You're all safe.
So, you accidentally lit the blaze, huh?
Yeah, thanks for reminding me.
Yeah, don't beat yourself up.
Life's a bitch if you live with regret.
Yeah, well, you seem like the kind of guy who can just move past stuff.
Are you kidding?
There's a ton of crap I wish I'd done differently.
- Like what?
- Well, being a better husband.
Being a better father to the boy I see two days a month.
You, uh...
Just got the one?
Yeah.
Well, no, actually.
You want to talk regret -- back in the day when I lived in the Bronx,
I found out I had another one.
Found out, huh?
Must have been living the single life.
Hardly.
I wanted to be with his mother.
But she basically hid the pregnancy from me.
Just about killed me when I saw her pushing that stroller down Lexington.
Really?
I mean, how would you feel if you suddenly realized that there's this part of you out there somewhere that you never got to know?
It's a damn shame.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I know.
It is.
But you didn't hire me to hear my life story.
It's just my long-winded way of telling you that I can get this all fixed up and no one's worse for the wear.
Yeah, no.
I guess you're right.
You know, sometimes it's better just to move past stuff.
And if I do my job right, you'll forget anything bad ever happened.
Stevie Grayson?
If that's what you still call yourself.
It is, Victoria.
How are you?
Well, it seems I'm condemned to revisit the horrors of my past, if you must know.
I'm sorry you see me that way, especially since the last time we spoke, you were on my husband's arm.
I'm surprised you remember that at all, considering your level of inebriation.
But before I'm subjected to similar verbal assault, please excuse me -- It's my daughter's birthday.
Oh, the one fathered by David Clarke, right?
You certainly have made paternity quite a hobby.
Why are you here, Stevie?
For payback?
Because you still seem as out of sorts as you were all those years ago.
You won, Victoria.
Isn't that enough?
Though I guess you're still trying to take what I already have.
Hm.
- Emily.
Ems.
Hey.
It happened again, didn't it?
I got worried when I didn't hear from you.
It just never occurred to me that you'd come home, I guess.
The question is, where were you before this?
I, um...
I remember being at the Stowaway.
With Conrad's first wife?
Emily, that was yesterday.
Do you even remember what you talked about?
Uh...
Apparently when I called her, not only did I ask for a divorce, but I almost told her about Aiden.
Phew.
So, blackout Em speaks the truth?
I'm aware of that, Nolan.
And are you aware that you are living with the enemy in a place where the truth could cost you your life?
Maybe your mind just wants to throw in the towel, Ems.
Ems!
♪ Happy Birthday to you... ♪
♪ Happy Birthday to you... ♪
♪ Happy Birthday, dear Charlotte... ♪
♪ Happy Birthday to you!
♪
♪ Make no mistake, these are animal urges... ♪
♪ Make no mistake, these are animal urges... ♪
♪ Make no mistake, make no mistake... ♪
Nolan, call me as soon as you get this.
Well, Daniel threw a beautiful party.
I can't believe Charlotte's 19.
A birthday brings to mind many things.
For a parent, it stirs up memories of a day blessed by a miracle.
A joyful gift cherished for years to come.
Sadly, it's an experience you'll never have.
Which makes me wonder -- who were your parents?
Where did you come from?
And why are you still here?
Oh, I would be honored to help you find an internship.
The magazine needs more can-do spirits.
Thanks, Dad.
I'll make you proud.
A job at Voulez?
What a wonderful idea, Charlotte.
And one I told you, like, 30 minutes ago, when you got here.
Of course.
Sorry.
And at the risk of repeating myself, kudos to you for taking my recommendation to call my ex-wife.
Have you spoken to her?
I'm just curious to hear how she reacted to your plan.
I remain optimistic.
You should know that if at any moment you feel unsafe around my son again,
I've told them to keep that suite at the South Fork on reserve for you.
I'm fine.
But thank you, Conrad.
All right.
Really?
Okay, that's good to know.
Thanks for the info.
Please.
Hear me out.
Why would I want to listen to someone who fired me?
Your father forced my hand.
If he had moved forward with his lawsuit, the magazine would have folded.
I'm trying to save it...
- For both of us.
- Yeah, well, both of us are no longer there to fight for it, are we?
That's why I wanted to see you.
What do you know of Conrad's relationship to my father?
Probably the same as you.
A while back, your dad had some investments at Grayson Global.
But they haven't been in touch in years.
Then what would he want with Pascal's attention now?
I don't know.
But he's certainly forming a lot of new partnerships.
One in particular I plan to get to the bottom of.
Keep in touch.
Very nice.
- I want to be, yeah.
- You gonna live there?
Charlotte, your friends were asking for you on the veranda.
- Oh.
Nice meeting you, Mr. Brennan.
- And a Happy Birthday to you.
You're the spitting image of your mom.
I didn't mean to crash your party.
I just need your approval on these paint chips your son selected.
Oh, well, I'm afraid that he and I are going to have to discuss his choices.
No problem.
It can wait.
I... couldn't help but notice you staring at me just like that in the gallery.
I beg your pardon?
It's time to open presents!
Well, it took me till now to pick up on it.
Come on, everyone!
I understand.
I mean, you're the ex-governor's wife.
You have to keep up appearances.
I respect that.
You're mistaken, Mr. Brennan.
Maybe I am.
But I don't think so.
Excuse me.
I have guests to attend to.
Go.
Make your little girl's dreams come true.
Good night.
- Put it away.
- Calm down.
Talk to me.
Always hiding behind technology, afraid that everyone will find out what a freak you really are.
I said put it away!
And that's when you hulked out on my cell.
I hope that's the only thing I broke.
Other than my ego?
Look, thankfully, my phone bore the brunt of your wrath because you made it terrifyingly clear that you did not want to be followed when I tried to stop you from going back into the lion's den.
I'm so sorry, Nolan.
I can't believe I said those things to you.
I can handle it.
What I can't handle is you flying without a net.
I mean, do you even know what Conrad's master plan is?
Not yet.
Oh, God, I wish I could just keep you locked up here until the full moon passes.
I do have my guest room back.
Aiden certainly left enough crap here.
You think he would've mastered the art of packing at this point.
Though my pilot said he never showed up, so...
I don't know.
You think maybe he's coming back for it?
Was this in his room?
Yeah.
Why?
It goes with Takeda's sword.
I was the only one who had this.
You do things that aren't you during these blackouts.
What if you planted it for Niko to find?
And if she did, she knows that Aiden killed her father.
I've got to go.
Aiden.
Aiden.
Okay.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I knew you'd come.
Let him go, Niko.
Not gonna happen.
He's guilty of too many things.
Like killing my father, lying to me about it, choosing a failure over me.
- You're out of your league.
- You're out of practice, even if we were both trained by the same great man.
But only one of us was his favorite.
Emily, no!
She doesn't deserve to die.
Emily.
No.
You have every right to want to see me dead, but killing me or Emily won't give you the peace you're after.
I loved you...
And you betrayed me
- and my father.
- No.
Your father died by his own code.
Don't let the same happen to you.
Please, Niko.
Go.
Can I get you anything else?
Once upon a time, you all made the best sidecars.
- Which means you knew my father.
- Mm-hmm.
Well, those were his specialty.
So, I can't promise that I've got his skills,
- but I'm happy to try for a loyal customer.
- I'm fine, thanks.
I just wanted to stop by for old times' sake before leaving town.
Okay.
Is that your boy?
Yeah.
It's Carl.
Named for my dad, actually.
Great smile.
Stevie Grayson.
Jack...
Porter, obviously.
So you're Conrad's first wife, huh?
We all make mistakes, right?
At least you were smart enough to leave him behind.
Spoken like someone who knows him.
I wish I didn't.
He's just caused a lot of problems for my family.
How so?
It's long story.
I'll save it for next time you're in town.
Hey.
Looks like it's time to get the little man to bed.
All right.
Come on.
- Bye, Carl!
- Thanks so much.
Sure.
No problem.
It was nice to meet you, Stevie.
You, too, Jack.
Rachel, it's me.
Cancel my flight back to L.A.
And get me Conrad Grayson's cell number.
You deliberately defied me!
Continuing to employ that man, after I specifically asked you to fire him!
I know what you told me, all right?
I couldn't do it.
- You have to do it.
- No, actually, I don't have to.
And after listening to him, uh --
Maybe he's not a monster anymore, okay?
He's got regrets.
He's got things in life he wishes he had done differently.
Why are you choosing to hurt me in this way?
I'm not, Mom.
I'm --
I'm choosing to get to know him a little better.
There is nothing left to know.
He came to my home this evening -- my house.
He made advances toward me.
And I saw in him the same heinous man who drew me in all those years ago.
It is me who's suffering, Patrick.
Not him, like you wanted.
Like you wanted?
Forgot my tool belt.
Look, Jimmy, we -- we should talk.
It's a little too late for that.
I can't believe I didn't figure it out sooner.
Vicky Harper.
Been a long time.
And you must be the kid that she stole from me.
Quite the happy family reunion, huh?
Hey, kid.
Did your dear mom ever mention to you how she used me back then?
How she took advantage of my help to get what she needed out of life.
And how did she thank me?
By giving you away.
I was 15 years old, and I was looking for someone to trust, and you preyed on that.
You raped me.
You knocked on my door that night.
We had a drink.
We hung out.
You said you were feeling adventurous -- that you wanted me down in that basement.
Oh, you bastard!
- Don't you dare walk away from me.
- No!
Keep your hands off me!
Get your hands off her!
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
We need to call an ambulance.
And he pushes my face into the cold concrete, and he whispers, "relax, honey."
Relax, honey.
Help me.
Relax, honey.
I'm fine, Emily.
You can go.
- Aiden --
- I don't want to hear it.
I guess I should be thanking you for saving my life...
But I wouldn't have been in jeopardy if you hadn't have planted that sword.
- Do you hate me that much?
- Of course I don't.
Then why do it?
I don't know.
But what I did...
That wasn't me.
I've been blacking out.
Are you seriously gonna blame this on some kind of mental break?
You think I wanted you dead?
It's like whatever...
state I was in,
I could see our reality.
I'm never gonna give up my plan.
I can't give you a family, a normal life.
So...
I don't know.
Maybe I was trying to push you away.
So why show up yesterday and throw yourself at me, looking for some kind of reconciliation?
Or is that news to you, too?
And just so you know,
I never needed any of those things.
I just needed you.
But you never gave me a choice, Emily.
Get help...
Before you do something else you'll regret.
My party was a blast, Daniel.
Sadly, no potential boyfriends, but, still, thank you.
Stay single, Charlotte.
Life's far easier that way.
I think Emily's out to get me.
A bellhop at the South Fork told me that she and Dad are working together on something.
Why would she trust him when his mistress shot her?
I'm not sure.
But, uh...
They got close when he thought he was dying.
And -- and you know he always wanted me to marry Emily.
Listen, I need you to help me with something.
What do you want me to do?
Voulez is Dad's new base of operations.
Okay?
Now that you're working there, find out all you can about what he's up to.
All right?
Like I said, it's just you and me now.
The police called with an update.
The coroner said that Jimmy died from massive blood loss following a fall from his ladder.
He ruled it an accident.
Right, it's... an accident.
We're not guilty of anything, Patrick.
What you did, you did to protect me.
Yeah.
But still...
Standing there tonight, watching my father die...
What is wrong with us?
We're victims of our world.
Of men like Jimmy Brennan.
But this dark chapter in our lives is finally over, and we can move on.
I don't know if I can.
Please sign it as you agreed.
I've had a long night and would like some solitude in my home.
Well, there may be a slight wrinkle.
What game are you playing now?
Sorry I'm late, Conrad.
How low you must have stooped to put this one on your legal team.
Oh, she's not joining my legal team.
She's merely here to impart some pertinent information.
Copies of the Grayson manor property deed.
It turns out that the land was actually purchased by Conrad before our divorce was final.
And while I may not have gotten much money in the split,
I did get all undeveloped real-estate holdings.
This house belongs to me.
And I will fight you until my last breath.
Let's hope that's sooner rather than later.
But until then, I own this place.
And I want you out by the end of the week.
Homeless...
At your age, Victoria -- What a pity.
And you.
You're an idiot if you think this makes us partners.
You wreak havoc in the lives of others, and that is about to catch up to you.
Doctor's still out on your psychosis?
She called.
The anomaly in my scan isn't causing the blackouts.
Well...
I've been worried sick about you.
And then, uh...
Something occurred to me about your past.
- Someone, actually.
- Nolan...
Look, you have to face the possibility.
I know.
My mother.
She was your age when she had her first break, wasn't she?
When she tried to drown me.
If nothing ever worked for her...
What hope is there for me?
Don't do that to yourself.
- There are people here to help.
- Who I'm driving away.
I lashed out at you.
I jeopardized Aiden's life.
I'm starting to go after the wrong people, Nolan.
What am I gonna do?
Okay.
Great, thanks.
I just need the loan approved, and then I can make the offer on the house.
What?
The guy says I should have it in a couple days.
Oh, but then I won't be here to celebrate with you.
I know.
I'll bring you something for the house back from Paris.
You sure you know what you're doing?
I have to force my father to see me.
That's the only way he'll hear me about Conrad.
- All right.
- I'll call you when I land.
Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
You can't get enough of the old place, can you?
I'd actually like to hear the stories you alluded to last night.
About Conrad?
Um...
It's not really any of your business.
Actually, it is.
Why?
Because, Jack...
I'm your mother.
Previously on Revenge...
- You set me up!
- I'm sorry.
I know it was you, Daniel.
I'm not going anywhere.
- We can build a future together.
- This is my future.
You're ending this with me?
I thought I could avenge my father's death by myself, but I can't.
I need you to help me.
Conrad is suing Voulez for libel.
I'm willing to drop my suit just as soon as you fire my son.
- If you think we're going to cave to your threats--
- I'll do it.
Jimmy Brennan?
Heard of him?
If I'm to believe what's in this police report, he may also go by "Dad."
- What did Jimmy Brennan do to you?
- He kisses me.
When I try to pull away, he pushes my face into the concrete.
I was expecting to see the former governor's wife.
I'm the first Mrs. Grayson.
- Are you okay?
- Since my head injury,
I'm getting a little dizzy sometimes.
You were marvelous last night, Mrs. Grayson.
Of all the weapons we take into battle, there is none more powerful than the mind.
It holds our instincts and our training and allows us to distinguish friend from foe, love from hate.
Hold perfectly still, Mrs. Grayson.
But if that weapon is unsound, it is by no means disarmed.
For the mind is all the more dangerous when damaged.
And there's no guarantee that it won't choose itself as its next victim.
Physically, you've recovered beyond expectation.
With regard to your head trauma, there are no permanent neurological problems evident.
However, there is a bit of swelling between the frontal and the left temporal lobes.
Would that explain the pounding in my ears, the blackouts?
I'm not a neurologist, Emily.
But the lab forwarded the results to one.
He'll have a better analysis for you tomorrow.
And until then, what do I do?
I...
I could be a risk to myself, to others.
Given your state of mind, maybe talking with someone would help.
At the least, it may help you remember what happened.
Because you still can't recall anything, right?
I'm glad to see I am still welcome.
I thought you'd have changed the locks by now.
Well, I have more important things on my mind than your departure, Conrad.
As have I while I've been staying at the South Fork.
I can only imagine what you've been up to.
Aside from having our son fired for your amusement, I mean.
Actually...
I've come to care about my new venture.
And, so that I may approach it with a clear mind,
I wanted to pop by in anticipation of convening our attorneys to cement our divorce tomorrow.
Oh, I assume, as always, my house will be the first thing you'll fight me over.
Why infringe on the beautiful memories of our first divorce by retreading the same duels during our second one?
Mrs. Grayson, there's been a fire at the gallery.
I still don't think we should have let ourselves in.
Ah, the realtor was late.
Besides, I needed to check for security issues.
Using break-in skills I was unaware of.
Oh, my account manager just quit.
That's the third person to leave since they heard of Conrad's maneuver.
Do not say "I told you so."
I'm taking the wait-and-see approach.
That's what I did when Conrad bought into the bar last year.
This is just to hurt Daniel.
Not me.
All right, look.
No more Conrad talk.
I don't want to bring in bad mojo right off the bat, 'cause...
I think this might be the place.
But you've only seen two houses.
I know, but my dad said that when you're looking, the first one you like is the one you should buy.
Though...
Are you sure you'd want to live here?
I know it's nowhere near what you're accustomed to.
I came here to start a new life and to leave the one I'd grown accustomed to in France far behind.
Since it's my birthday tomorrow and you probably forgot again,
I decided I'd just tell you what to get me.
Okay, guilty as charged.
So you name it, and it's yours.
I was rejected from the design institute.
I thought I had a shot, but I guess they thought I lacked experience.
So I was hoping you could find something for me at Voulez.
You want my job?
'Cause it's available.
Seems there's no end to Dad's insecurity.
He got me fired and took my stake in the magazine.
I'm so sorry, Daniel.
At least use it to your advantage.
I guarantee he'll flex his sagging muscles to help you.
But you know what?
I'd rather spend my time throwing you an epic birthday party.
You can't pull all that together in one day.
You deserve it, Sis.
After all, seems pretty clear it's me and you against the world.
What happened?
I came here last night to work, try to deal with what you told me, and I, uh...
Well, I got so upset that I, uh...
This is my fault.
I'm sorry.
No.
No, no, no.
It's my fault.
You should go, though, all right?
Let me deal with this.
No.
We're in this together.
Wow.
Somebody really did a number on this place, huh?
I'm Jimmy Brennan, the contractor you called.
I don't know how you heard about me.
It must've been good, right?
Hey.
Are those Aiden's?
Where's he going?
Wherever he tells my jet to take him.
Is he here?
Since I knew you were coming over,
I told him to scram.
I didn't want to confuse an already confusing situation.
Did you want to say goodbye to him?
No.
It's probably best this way, especially since I don't know what I'm doing half the time.
Which brings us to why you wanted twelve hours of South Fork security-cam footage.
Okay.
Here you are on the phone.
Any idea who you were talking to?
No.
Well, I bet Conrad does.
Picks up in the hallway.
You go in.
Conrad leaves.
At least he was a gentleman.
He didn't come back till 7:00.
When I woke up.
What is going on with you, Ems?
Blackouts?
Colluding with Conrad?
My C.A.T. scan showed swelling.
When that goes down, I'm sure whatever this is will stop.
Yeah, but is that what the doctor told you or what you wanted to hear?
She's sending my results to a specialist.
Maybe you should talk to a therapist.
You know I can't risk telling a stranger the truth.
Yeah, but isn't that a risk you're already taking?
I have survived on my own this long.
Trust me.
I can handle it.
You sure about that?
Who do you know in Los Angeles?
- Hello?
- Emily?
Stevie Grayson.
- It's nice to talk to you again.
- Yeah?
I'm in town, and I'm ready to process your divorce.
I begged you to leave well enough alone.
Yeah, that was before you told me what happened --
Before you told me that you were forced to sacrifice me, move across the ocean to stay away from that guy.
And I spent my life building a world to escape what he did.
And now he is in our space.
- I should never have told you what happened.
- Why?
So I wouldn't find out what a monster he was?
Or that I'm a child of rape?
- I'm gonna kill him.
- Patrick.
Please...
Don't do anything.
If I lost you because of that man...
You are the one good thing that came out of the worst time of my life.
It's why I hold you so dear.
Now, I want you to fire that man now.
- All right.
Okay.
- All right.
Got it.
Charlotte loves his music.
You really think you can get him?
For Daniel Grayson, I'll clone him if I have to.
Ah, there she is.
Larissa, this is my wife, Emily.
Daniel's told me everything you've been through.
You're lucky to have such a strong man by your side.
- You have no idea.
- Oh, I might.
He's pulling out all the stops for this birthday party.
For Charlotte?
That's nice of you, Daniel.
I do all I can for the people I love.
I'm gonna go check out where the band should set up.
Okay.
All right.
I heard you, uh -- you didn't come home last night.
I'm surprised you care, especially after you man-handled me.
Something I know you'll regret.
No, the only thing I'll regret is my marriage to you.
Because publishing my memoirs in serial form will only help to increase our circulation.
And with my pedigree, I can guarantee that Mr. LeMarchal will see us as something far more than a curiosity which lies an ocean away.
Wouldn't you agree, Margaux?
I need to speak to Conrad alone.
Now.
You have no right holding a creative meeting without me.
Oh, I can't help it if you're house hunting while I'm settling in.
I run things around here.
And not my father, as you seem to be implying.
You are absolutely correct.
He controls an international media empire.
Mm-hmm, which is why you're wasting your time hoping he'll care about this magazine.
Or maybe you just don't know how to get his attention.
- Emily?
- Yes.
- Stevie Grayson.
- Nice to meet you.
I thought it best that we meet someplace out of the way.
- Let's take a booth.
- Yeah.
I always like hiding out in this Stowaway.
I knew we'd get along great.
I used to come here years ago.
- Well, thank you for coming again.
- You kidding?
I've handled over a thousand divorces.
Nothing compares to a Grayson man.
Only they could get me to cross the country for a kindred spirit.
So, down to business.
Do you want to stick with the terms you suggested on the phone last night?
Well, um, now that you've had the night to sleep on it, I, well --
I think I'd rather get your opinion.
Obviously,
Daniel cheating in your residence is grounds for annulment -- slam dunk.
You know, I --
I don't know if I can go through with this.
Daniel and I -- yes, we've been having a hard time.
But...
Maybe I'm overreacting.
You know, I think we could work it out.
Really?
Last night, you were convinced otherwise.
In fact, you went as far to say that you were also in love with someone else.
No.
It's just Daniel.
Okay.
You can tell me whatever you want.
That look in your eyes...
Is a look of love, and not for the man you married.
I can't lose you.
Not to my plan or to Niko.
No, Emily.
Emily.
You can't do this now.
What is wrong with you?
Let go!
Look, I have to go.
If you want to have a sensible conversation...
I'll call you from London, but this isn't happening.
Have you been told where we're going?
What the hell are you doing, Niko?
Avenging my father, like I said I would.
You didn't think I'd find this under your bed?
Speechless?
That's funny, Aiden.
Because you knew exactly what to say when you showed up in Japan.
And when you tried to send me to Russia to kill someone for a crime you committed.
I can't believe I nursed my father's murderer back to health.
I didn't murder him.
We fought like warriors.
He attacked me, and I defended.
A death was inevitable.
I wanted to tell you, and one day, I would have.
But you had to help Emily first.
That was the code your father taught us.
- We go where we're needed.
- Oh, I'm counting on it.
I left her a clue just to see if she was really as good as he claimed.
And when she shows up here to save you,
I'm gonna kill her.
What?
You took someone I love on this spot.
You can watch while I do the same.
We'll tell him $5,000 a month in child support, another $5,000 in alimony, and --
Know what?
Uh...
I am back tomorrow.
Just sit tight.
I should have known you were behind this, Conrad.
So I assume Emily's whole divorce story was a sham?
Oh, no.
No.
Quite the contrary.
Emily would be wise to rid herself of my son.
That said...
I am glad you've come, especially as we're neighbors.
You're living in a hotel?
Yeah, while Emily's chosen to not follow through with her inevitable divorce, that hasn't stopped me from proceeding with my own.
And are you planning on treating Victoria as horribly as you did me?
Actually, that's why I'm here.
You know, I regret the way I handled things back then and would like this chance to make my sincere amends.
Hmm.
You know, I want you to read this.
I believe it makes ample restitution for my misdeeds...
With the added benefit of giving Victoria
- her overdue comeuppance.
- Hmm.
There was a period in my life when I would have wanted nothing more.
But there's one problem.
I'm happy now.
Oh, well...
Why don't you give that time?
That always changes.
Yeah, most of my crew's on another job.
But I couldn't pass up the chance to slap Grayson on my client list.
Yeah.
Hey, you got the power cut?
Uh...
There you go.
You're all safe.
So, you accidentally lit the blaze, huh?
Yeah, thanks for reminding me.
Yeah, don't beat yourself up.
Life's a bitch if you live with regret.
Yeah, well, you seem like the kind of guy who can just move past stuff.
Are you kidding?
There's a ton of crap I wish I'd done differently.
- Like what?
- Well, being a better husband.
Being a better father to the boy I see two days a month.
You, uh...
Just got the one?
Yeah.
Well, no, actually.
You want to talk regret -- back in the day when I lived in the Bronx,
I found out I had another one.
Found out, huh?
Must have been living the single life.
Hardly.
I wanted to be with his mother.
But she basically hid the pregnancy from me.
Just about killed me when I saw her pushing that stroller down Lexington.
Really?
I mean, how would you feel if you suddenly realized that there's this part of you out there somewhere that you never got to know?
It's a damn shame.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I know.
It is.
But you didn't hire me to hear my life story.
It's just my long-winded way of telling you that I can get this all fixed up and no one's worse for the wear.
Yeah, no.
I guess you're right.
You know, sometimes it's better just to move past stuff.
And if I do my job right, you'll forget anything bad ever happened.
Stevie Grayson?
If that's what you still call yourself.
It is, Victoria.
How are you?
Well, it seems I'm condemned to revisit the horrors of my past, if you must know.
I'm sorry you see me that way, especially since the last time we spoke, you were on my husband's arm.
I'm surprised you remember that at all, considering your level of inebriation.
But before I'm subjected to similar verbal assault, please excuse me -- It's my daughter's birthday.
Oh, the one fathered by David Clarke, right?
You certainly have made paternity quite a hobby.
Why are you here, Stevie?
For payback?
Because you still seem as out of sorts as you were all those years ago.
You won, Victoria.
Isn't that enough?
Though I guess you're still trying to take what I already have.
Hm.
Emily.
Ems.
Hey.
It happened again, didn't it?
I got worried when I didn't hear from you.
It just never occurred to me that you'd come home, I guess.
The question is, where were you before this?
I, um...
I remember being at the Stowaway.
With Conrad's first wife?
Emily, that was yesterday.
Do you even remember what you talked about?
Uh...
Apparently when I called her, not only did I ask for a divorce, but I almost told her about Aiden.
Phew.
So, blackout Em speaks the truth?
I'm aware of that, Nolan.
And are you aware that you are living with the enemy in a place where the truth could cost you your life?
Maybe your mind just wants to throw in the towel, Ems.
Ems!
♪ Happy Birthday to you... ♪
♪ Happy Birthday to you... ♪
♪ Happy Birthday, dear Charlotte... ♪
♪ Happy Birthday to you!
♪
♪ Make no mistake, these are animal urges... ♪
♪ Make no mistake, these are animal urges... ♪
♪ Make no mistake, make no mistake... ♪
Nolan, call me as soon as you get this.
Well, Daniel threw a beautiful party.
I can't believe Charlotte's 19.
A birthday brings to mind many things.
For a parent, it stirs up memories of a day blessed by a miracle.
A joyful gift cherished for years to come.
Sadly, it's an experience you'll never have.
Which makes me wonder -- who were your parents?
Where did you come from?
And why are you still here?
Oh, I would be honored to help you find an internship.
The magazine needs more can-do spirits.
Thanks, Dad.
I'll make you proud.
A job at Voulez?
What a wonderful idea, Charlotte.
And one I told you, like, 30 minutes ago, when you got here.
Of course.
Sorry.
And at the risk of repeating myself, kudos to you for taking my recommendation to call my ex-wife.
Have you spoken to her?
I'm just curious to hear how she reacted to your plan.
I remain optimistic.
You should know that if at any moment you feel unsafe around my son again,
I've told them to keep that suite at the South Fork on reserve for you.
I'm fine.
But thank you, Conrad.
All right.
Really?
Okay, that's good to know.
Thanks for the info.
Please.
Hear me out.
Why would I want to listen to someone who fired me?
Your father forced my hand.
If he had moved forward with his lawsuit, the magazine would have folded.
I'm trying to save it...
- For both of us.
- Yeah, well, both of us are no longer there to fight for it, are we?
That's why I wanted to see you.
What do you know of Conrad's relationship to my father?
Probably the same as you.
A while back, your dad had some investments at Grayson Global.
But they haven't been in touch in years.
Then what would he want with Pascal's attention now?
I don't know.
But he's certainly forming a lot of new partnerships.
One in particular I plan to get to the bottom of.
Keep in touch.
Very nice.
- I want to be, yeah.
- You gonna live there?
Charlotte, your friends were asking for you on the veranda.
- Oh.
Nice meeting you, Mr. Brennan.
- And a Happy Birthday to you.
You're the spitting image of your mom.
I didn't mean to crash your party.
I just need your approval on these paint chips your son selected.
Oh, well, I'm afraid that he and I are going to have to discuss his choices.
No problem.
It can wait.
I... couldn't help but notice you staring at me just like that in the gallery.
I beg your pardon?
It's time to open presents!
Well, it took me till now to pick up on it.
Come on, everyone!
I understand.
I mean, you're the ex-governor's wife.
You have to keep up appearances.
I respect that.
You're mistaken, Mr. Brennan.
Maybe I am.
But I don't think so.
Excuse me.
I have guests to attend to.
Go.
Make your little girl's dreams come true.
Good night.
- Put it away.
- Calm down.
Talk to me.
Always hiding behind technology, afraid that everyone will find out what a freak you really are.
I said put it away!
And that's when you hulked out on my cell.
I hope that's the only thing I broke.
Other than my ego?
Look, thankfully, my phone bore the brunt of your wrath because you made it terrifyingly clear that you did not want to be followed when I tried to stop you from going back into the lion's den.
I'm so sorry, Nolan.
I can't believe I said those things to you.
I can handle it.
What I can't handle is you flying without a net.
I mean, do you even know what Conrad's master plan is?
Not yet.
Oh, God, I wish I could just keep you locked up here until the full moon passes.
I do have my guest room back.
Aiden certainly left enough crap here.
You think he would've mastered the art of packing at this point.
Though my pilot said he never showed up, so...
I don't know.
You think maybe he's coming back for it?
Was this in his room?
Yeah.
Why?
It goes with Takeda's sword.
I was the only one who had this.
You do things that aren't you during these blackouts.
What if you planted it for Niko to find?
And if she did, she knows that Aiden killed her father.
I've got to go.
Aiden.
Aiden.
Okay.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
I knew you'd come.
Let him go, Niko.
Not gonna happen.
He's guilty of too many things.
Like killing my father, lying to me about it, choosing a failure over me.
- You're out of your league.
- You're out of practice, even if we were both trained by the same great man.
But only one of us was his favorite.
Emily, no!
She doesn't deserve to die.
Emily.
No.
You have every right to want to see me dead, but killing me or Emily won't give you the peace you're after.
I loved you...
And you betrayed me
- and my father.
- No.
Your father died by his own code.
Don't let the same happen to you.
Please, Niko.
Go.
Can I get you anything else?
Once upon a time, you all made the best sidecars.
- Which means you knew my father.
- Mm-hmm.
Well, those were his specialty.
So, I can't promise that I've got his skills,
- but I'm happy to try for a loyal customer.
- I'm fine, thanks.
I just wanted to stop by for old times' sake before leaving town.
Okay.
Is that your boy?
Yeah.
It's Carl.
Named for my dad, actually.
Great smile.
Stevie Grayson.
Jack...
Porter, obviously.
So you're Conrad's first wife, huh?
We all make mistakes, right?
At least you were smart enough to leave him behind.
Spoken like someone who knows him.
I wish I didn't.
He's just caused a lot of problems for my family.
How so?
It's long story.
I'll save it for next time you're in town.
Hey.
Looks like it's time to get the little man to bed.
All right.
Come on.
- Bye, Carl!
- Thanks so much.
Sure.
No problem.
It was nice to meet you, Stevie.
You, too, Jack.
Rachel, it's me.
Cancel my flight back to L.A.
And get me Conrad Grayson's cell number.
You deliberately defied me!
Continuing to employ that man, after I specifically asked you to fire him!
I know what you told me, all right?
I couldn't do it.
- You have to do it.
- No, actually, I don't have to.
And after listening to him, uh --
Maybe he's not a monster anymore, okay?
He's got regrets.
He's got things in life he wishes he had done differently.
Why are you choosing to hurt me in this way?
I'm not, Mom.
I'm --
I'm choosing to get to know him a little better.
There is nothing left to know.
He came to my home this evening -- my house.
He made advances toward me.
And I saw in him the same heinous man who drew me in all those years ago.
It is me who's suffering, Patrick.
Not him, like you wanted.
Like you wanted?
Forgot my tool belt.
Look, Jimmy, we -- we should talk.
It's a little too late for that.
I can't believe I didn't figure it out sooner.
Vicky Harper.
Been a long time.
And you must be the kid that she stole from me.
Quite the happy family reunion, huh?
Hey, kid.
Did your dear mom ever mention to you how she used me back then?
How she took advantage of my help to get what she needed out of life.
And how did she thank me?
By giving you away.
I was 15 years old, and I was looking for someone to trust, and you preyed on that.
You raped me.
You knocked on my door that night.
We had a drink.
We hung out.
You said you were feeling adventurous -- that you wanted me down in that basement.
Oh, you bastard!
- Don't you dare walk away from me.
- No!
Keep your hands off me!
Get your hands off her!
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
We need to call an ambulance.
And he pushes my face into the cold concrete, and he whispers, "relax, honey."
Relax, honey.
Help me.
Relax, honey.
I'm fine, Emily.
You can go.
- Aiden --
- I don't want to hear it.
I guess I should be thanking you for saving my life...
But I wouldn't have been in jeopardy if you hadn't have planted that sword.
- Do you hate me that much?
- Of course I don't.
Then why do it?
I don't know.
But what I did...
That wasn't me.
I've been blacking out.
Are you seriously gonna blame this on some kind of mental break?
You think I wanted you dead?
It's like whatever...
state I was in,
I could see our reality.
I'm never gonna give up my plan.
I can't give you a family, a normal life.
So...
I don't know.
Maybe I was trying to push you away.
So why show up yesterday and throw yourself at me, looking for some kind of reconciliation?
Or is that news to you, too?
And just so you know,
I never needed any of those things.
I just needed you.
But you never gave me a choice, Emily.
Get help...
Before you do something else you'll regret.
My party was a blast, Daniel.
Sadly, no potential boyfriends, but, still, thank you.
Stay single, Charlotte.
Life's far easier that way.
I think Emily's out to get me.
A bellhop at the South Fork told me that she and Dad are working together on something.
Why would she trust him when his mistress shot her?
I'm not sure.
But, uh...
They got close when he thought he was dying.
And -- and you know he always wanted me to marry Emily.
Listen, I need you to help me with something.
What do you want me to do?
Voulez is Dad's new base of operations.
Okay?
Now that you're working there, find out all you can about what he's up to.
All right?
Like I said, it's just you and me now.
The police called with an update.
The coroner said that Jimmy died from massive blood loss following a fall from his ladder.
He ruled it an accident.
Right, it's... an accident.
We're not guilty of anything, Patrick.
What you did, you did to protect me.
Yeah.
But still...
Standing there tonight, watching my father die...
What is wrong with us?
We're victims of our world.
Of men like Jimmy Brennan.
But this dark chapter in our lives is finally over, and we can move on.
I don't know if I can.
Please sign it as you agreed.
I've had a long night and would like some solitude in my home.
Well, there may be a slight wrinkle.
What game are you playing now?
Sorry I'm late, Conrad.
How low you must have stooped to put this one on your legal team.
Oh, she's not joining my legal team.
She's merely here to impart some pertinent information.
Copies of the Grayson manor property deed.
It turns out that the land was actually purchased by Conrad before our divorce was final.
And while I may not have gotten much money in the split,
I did get all undeveloped real-estate holdings.
This house belongs to me.
And I will fight you until my last breath.
Let's hope that's sooner rather than later.
But until then, I own this place.
And I want you out by the end of the week.
Homeless...
At your age, Victoria -- What a pity.
And you.
You're an idiot if you think this makes us partners.
You wreak havoc in the lives of others, and that is about to catch up to you.
Doctor's still out on your psychosis?
She called.
The anomaly in my scan isn't causing the blackouts.
Well...
I've been worried sick about you.
And then, uh...
Something occurred to me about your past.
- Someone, actually.
- Nolan...
Look, you have to face the possibility.
I know.
My mother.
She was your age when she had her first break, wasn't she?
When she tried to drown me.
If nothing ever worked for her...
What hope is there for me?
Don't do that to yourself.
- There are people here to help.
- Who I'm driving away.
I lashed out at you.
I jeopardized Aiden's life.
I'm starting to go after the wrong people, Nolan.
What am I gonna do?
Okay.
Great, thanks.
I just need the loan approved, and then I can make the offer on the house.
What?
The guy says I should have it in a couple days.
Oh, but then I won't be here to celebrate with you.
I know.
I'll bring you something for the house back from Paris.
You sure you know what you're doing?
I have to force my father to see me.
That's the only way he'll hear me about Conrad.
- All right.
- I'll call you when I land.
Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
You can't get enough of the old place, can you?
I'd actually like to hear the stories you alluded to last night.
About Conrad?
Um...
It's not really any of your business.
Actually, it is.
Why?
Because, Jack...
I'm your mother.
Previously on Revenge...
- You set me up!
- I'm sorry.
[ Gunshots ]
I know it was you, Daniel.
I'm not going anywhere.
- We can build a future together.
- This is my future.
You're ending this with me?
I thought I could avenge my father's death by myself, but I can't.
I need you to help me.
Conrad is suing Voulez for libel.
I'm willing to drop my suit just as soon as you fire my son.
- If you think we're going to cave to your threats--
- I'll do it.
Jimmy Brennan?
Heard of him?
If I'm to believe what's in this police report, he may also go by "Dad."
- What did Jimmy Brennan do to you?
- He kisses me.
When I try to pull away, he pushes my face into the concrete.
I was expecting to see the former governor's wife.
I'm the first Mrs. Grayson.
- Are you okay?
- Since my head injury,
I'm getting a little dizzy sometimes.
You were marvelous last night, Mrs. Grayson.
Emily:
Of all the weapons we take into battle, there is none more powerful than the mind.
It holds our instincts and our training and allows us to distinguish friend from foe, love from hate.
Dr. Sturman:
Hold perfectly still, Mrs. Grayson.
But if that weapon is unsound, it is by no means disarmed.
For the mind is all the more dangerous when damaged.
And there's no guarantee that it won't choose itself as its next victim.
Dr. Sturman:
Physically, you've recovered beyond expectation.
With regard to your head trauma, there are no permanent neurological problems evident.
However, there is a bit of swelling between the frontal and the left temporal lobes.
Would that explain the pounding in my ears, the blackouts?
I'm not a neurologist, Emily.
But the lab forwarded the results to one.
He'll have a better analysis for you tomorrow.
And until then, what do I do?
I...
I could be a risk to myself, to others.
Given your state of mind, maybe talking with someone would help.
At the least, it may help you remember what happened.
Because you still can't recall anything, right?
Conrad:
I'm glad to see I am still welcome.
I thought you'd have changed the locks by now.
Well, I have more important things on my mind than your departure, Conrad.
As have I while I've been staying at the South Fork.
I can only imagine what you've been up to.
Aside from having our son fired for your amusement, I mean.
Actually...
I've come to care about my new venture.
And, so that I may approach it with a clear mind,
I wanted to pop by in anticipation of convening our attorneys to cement our divorce tomorrow.
Oh, I assume, as always, my house will be the first thing you'll fight me over.
Why infringe on the beautiful memories of our first divorce by retreading the same duels during our second one?
Mrs. Grayson, there's been a fire at the gallery.
Margaux:
I still don't think we should have let ourselves in.
Ah, the realtor was late.
Besides, I needed to check for security issues.
Using break-in skills I was unaware of.
[ Cellphone chimes ]
Oh, my account manager just quit.
That's the third person to leave since they heard of Conrad's maneuver.
Do not say "I told you so."
I'm taking the wait-and-see approach.
That's what I did when Conrad bought into the bar last year.
This is just to hurt Daniel.
Not me.
All right, look.
No more Conrad talk.
[ Chuckles ]
I don't want to bring in bad mojo right off the bat, 'cause...
[ Breathes deeply ]
I think this might be the place.
But you've only seen two houses.
I know, but my dad said that when you're looking, the first one you like is the one you should buy.
Though...
Are you sure you'd want to live here?
I know it's nowhere near what you're accustomed to.
I came here to start a new life and to leave the one I'd grown accustomed to in France far behind.
Since it's my birthday tomorrow and you probably forgot again,
I decided I'd just tell you what to get me.
Okay, guilty as charged.
So you name it, and it's yours.
I was rejected from the design institute.
I thought I had a shot, but I guess they thought I lacked experience.
So I was hoping you could find something for me at Voulez.
You want my job?
[ Chuckles ] 'Cause it's available.
Seems there's no end to Dad's insecurity.
He got me fired and took my stake in the magazine.
I'm so sorry, Daniel.
At least use it to your advantage.
I guarantee he'll flex his sagging muscles to help you.
But you know what?
I'd rather spend my time throwing you an epic birthday party.
You can't pull all that together in one day.
You deserve it, Sis.
After all, seems pretty clear it's me and you against the world.
What happened?
I came here last night to work, try to deal with what you told me, and I, uh...
Well, I got so upset that I, uh...
This is my fault.
I'm sorry.
No.
No, no, no.
It's my fault.
You should go, though, all right?
Let me deal with this.
No.
We're in this together.
Wow.
Somebody really did a number on this place, huh?
[ Sighs ]
I'm Jimmy Brennan, the contractor you called.
I don't know how you heard about me.
It must've been good, right?
Hey.
Are those Aiden's?
Where's he going?
Wherever he tells my jet to take him.
Is he here?
Since I knew you were coming over,
I told him to scram.
I didn't want to confuse an already confusing situation.
Did you want to say goodbye to him?
[ Sighs ] No.
It's probably best this way, especially since I don't know what I'm doing half the time.
Which brings us to why you wanted twelve hours of South Fork security-cam footage.
Okay.
Here you are on the phone.
Any idea who you were talking to?
[ Emily sighs ] No.
Well, I bet Conrad does.
[ Keyboard clacks ]
Picks up in the hallway.
You go in.
Conrad leaves.
[ Keyboard clacks ]
At least he was a gentleman.
He didn't come back till 7:00.
When I woke up.
What is going on with you, Ems?
Blackouts?
Colluding with Conrad?
My C.A.T. scan showed swelling.
When that goes down, I'm sure whatever this is will stop.
Yeah, but is that what the doctor told you or what you wanted to hear?
She's sending my results to a specialist.
Maybe you should talk to a therapist.
You know I can't risk telling a stranger the truth.
Yeah, but isn't that a risk you're already taking?
I have survived on my own this long.
Trust me.
I can handle it.
[ Cellphone ringing ]
You sure about that?
Who do you know in Los Angeles?
- Hello?
- Emily?
Stevie Grayson.
- It's nice to talk to you again.
- Yeah?
I'm in town, and I'm ready to process your divorce.
[ Sighs ]
I begged you to leave well enough alone.
Yeah, that was before you told me what happened --
Before you told me that you were forced to sacrifice me, move across the ocean to stay away from that guy.
And I spent my life building a world to escape what he did.
And now he is in our space.
- I should never have told you what happened.
- Why?
So I wouldn't find out what a monster he was?
Or that I'm a child of rape?
[ Inhales sharply ]
- I'm gonna kill him.
- Patrick.
Please...
Don't do anything.
If I lost you because of that man...
You are the one good thing that came out of the worst time of my life.
It's why I hold you so dear.
Now, I want you to fire that man now.
Jimmy:
All right.
Okay.
All right.
Got it.
Daniel:
Charlotte loves his music.
You really think you can get him?
For Daniel Grayson, I'll clone him if I have to.
[ Chuckles ]
Ah, there she is.
Larissa, this is my wife, Emily.
Daniel's told me everything you've been through.
You're lucky to have such a strong man by your side.
- You have no idea.
- Oh, I might.
He's pulling out all the stops for this birthday party.
For Charlotte?
That's nice of you, Daniel.
I do all I can for the people I love.
I'm gonna go check out where the band should set up.
Okay.
All right.
I heard you, uh -- you didn't come home last night.
I'm surprised you care, especially after you man-handled me.
Something I know you'll regret.
No, the only thing I'll regret is my marriage to you.
Conrad:
Because publishing my memoirs in serial form will only help to increase our circulation.
And with my pedigree, I can guarantee that Mr. LeMarchal will see us as something far more than a curiosity which lies an ocean away.
Wouldn't you agree, Margaux?
I need to speak to Conrad alone.
Now.
You have no right holding a creative meeting without me.
Oh, I can't help it if you're house hunting while I'm settling in.
I run things around here.
And not my father, as you seem to be implying.
You are absolutely correct.
He controls an international media empire.
Mm-hmm, which is why you're wasting your time hoping he'll care about this magazine.
Or maybe you just don't know how to get his attention.
- Emily?
- Yes.
- Stevie Grayson.
- Nice to meet you.
I thought it best that we meet someplace out of the way.
- Let's take a booth.
- Yeah.
I always like hiding out in this Stowaway.
I knew we'd get along great.
I used to come here years ago.
- Well, thank you for coming again.
- You kidding?
I've handled over a thousand divorces.
Nothing compares to a Grayson man.
Only they could get me to cross the country for a kindred spirit.
So, down to business.
Do you want to stick with the terms you suggested on the phone last night?
[ Inhales deeply ] Well, um, now that you've had the night to sleep on it, I, well --
I think I'd rather get your opinion.
Obviously,
Daniel cheating in your residence is grounds for annulment -- slam dunk.
[ Inhales deeply ]
You know, I -- [ Sighs ]
I don't know if I can go through with this.
Daniel and I -- yes, we've been having a hard time.
But...
Maybe I'm overreacting.
You know, I think we could work it out.
Really?
Last night, you were convinced otherwise.
In fact, you went as far to say that you were also in love with someone else.
No.
It's just Daniel.
Okay.
You can tell me whatever you want.
That look in your eyes...
Is a look of love, and not for the man you married.
[ Heartbeat pounding ] [ Sighs ]
[ Breathing heavily ]
I can't lose you.
Not to my plan or to Niko.
No, Emily.
Emily.
You can't do this now.
What is wrong with you?
Let go!
[ Panting ]
Look, I have to go.
If you want to have a sensible conversation...
I'll call you from London, but this isn't happening.
Have you been told where we're going?
[ Grunts ]
[ Grunts ]
What the hell are you doing, Niko?
Avenging my father, like I said I would.
You didn't think I'd find this under your bed?
Speechless?
That's funny, Aiden.
Because you knew exactly what to say when you showed up in Japan.
And when you tried to send me to Russia to kill someone for a crime you committed.
I can't believe I nursed my father's murderer back to health.
I didn't murder him.
We fought like warriors.
He attacked me, and I defended.
A death was inevitable.
I wanted to tell you, and one day, I would have.
But you had to help Emily first.
That was the code your father taught us.
- We go where we're needed.
- Oh, I'm counting on it.
I left her a clue just to see if she was really as good as he claimed.
And when she shows up here to save you,
I'm gonna kill her.
What?
You took someone I love on this spot.
You can watch while I do the same.
We'll tell him $5,000 a month in child support, another $5,000 in alimony, and --
[ Knock on door ]
Know what?
Uh...
I am back tomorrow.
Just sit tight.
[ Chuckles ]
I should have known you were behind this, Conrad.
So I assume Emily's whole divorce story was a sham?
Oh, no.
No.
Quite the contrary.
Emily would be wise to rid herself of my son.
That said...
I am glad you've come, especially as we're neighbors.
[ Chuckles ]
You're living in a hotel?
Yeah, while Emily's chosen to not follow through with her inevitable divorce, that hasn't stopped me from proceeding with my own.
And are you planning on treating Victoria as horribly as you did me?
Actually, that's why I'm here.
You know, I regret the way I handled things back then and would like this chance to make my sincere amends.
Hmm.
You know, I want you to read this.
I believe it makes ample restitution for my misdeeds...
With the added benefit of giving Victoria
- her overdue comeuppance.
- Hmm.
[ Chuckles ] There was a period in my life when I would have wanted nothing more.
But there's one problem.
I'm happy now.
Oh, well...
Why don't you give that time?
That always changes.
Yeah, most of my crew's on another job.
But I couldn't pass up the chance to slap Grayson on my client list.
Yeah.
[ Sighs ]
Hey, you got the power cut?
Uh...
There you go.
You're all safe.
So, you accidentally lit the blaze, huh?
Yeah, thanks for reminding me.
Yeah, don't beat yourself up.
Life's a bitch if you live with regret.
Yeah, well, you seem like the kind of guy who can just move past stuff.
Are you kidding?
There's a ton of crap I wish I'd done differently.
- Like what?
- Well, being a better husband.
Being a better father to the boy I see two days a month.
You, uh...
Just got the one?
Yeah.
Well, no, actually.
You want to talk regret -- back in the day when I lived in the Bronx,
I found out I had another one.
Found out, huh?
Must have been living the single life.
Hardly.
I wanted to be with his mother.
But she basically hid the pregnancy from me.
Just about killed me when I saw her pushing that stroller down Lexington.
Really?
Jimmy:
I mean, how would you feel if you suddenly realized that there's this part of you out there somewhere that you never got to know?
It's a damn shame.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I know.
It is.
But you didn't hire me to hear my life story.
It's just my long-winded way of telling you that I can get this all fixed up and no one's worse for the wear.
Yeah, no.
I guess you're right.
You know, sometimes it's better just to move past stuff.
And if I do my job right, you'll forget anything bad ever happened.
Stevie Grayson?
If that's what you still call yourself.
It is, Victoria.
How are you?
Well, it seems I'm condemned to revisit the horrors of my past, if you must know.
I'm sorry you see me that way, especially since the last time we spoke, you were on my husband's arm.
[ Chuckles ] I'm surprised you remember that at all, considering your level of inebriation.
[ Chuckles ]
But before I'm subjected to similar verbal assault, please excuse me -- It's my daughter's birthday.
Oh, the one fathered by David Clarke, right?
You certainly have made paternity quite a hobby.
Why are you here, Stevie?
For payback?
Because you still seem as out of sorts as you were all those years ago.
You won, Victoria.
Isn't that enough?
Though I guess you're still trying to take what I already have.
Hm.
Nolan:
Emily.
[ Footsteps approach ]
Ems.
Hey.
It happened again, didn't it?
I got worried when I didn't hear from you.
It just never occurred to me that you'd come home, I guess.
The question is, where were you before this?
I, um...
I remember being at the Stowaway.
With Conrad's first wife?
Emily, that was yesterday.
Do you even remember what you talked about?
Uh...
Apparently when I called her, not only did I ask for a divorce, but I almost told her about Aiden.
Phew.
So, blackout Em speaks the truth?
I'm aware of that, Nolan.
And are you aware that you are living with the enemy in a place where the truth could cost you your life?
[ Sighs ]
Maybe your mind just wants to throw in the towel, Ems.
[ Heartbeat pounding ] [ Breathing heavily ]
Ems!
Together: [ Distorted ] ♪ Happy Birthday to you... ♪
♪ Happy Birthday to you... ♪
♪ Happy Birthday, dear Charlotte... ♪
♪ Happy Birthday to you!
♪
[ Cheers and applause ]
♪ Make no mistake, these are animal urges... ♪
♪ Make no mistake, these are animal urges... ♪
♪ Make no mistake, make no mistake... ♪
[ Music continues ]
Nolan, call me as soon as you get this.
Well, Daniel threw a beautiful party.
I can't believe Charlotte's 19.
A birthday brings to mind many things.
For a parent, it stirs up memories of a day blessed by a miracle.
A joyful gift cherished for years to come.
Sadly, it's an experience you'll never have.
Which makes me wonder -- who were your parents?
Where did you come from?
And why are you still here?
Oh, I would be honored to help you find an internship.
The magazine needs more can-do spirits.
Thanks, Dad.
I'll make you proud.
Emily:
A job at Voulez?
What a wonderful idea, Charlotte.
And one I told you, like, 30 minutes ago, when you got here.
Of course.
Sorry.
And at the risk of repeating myself, kudos to you for taking my recommendation to call my ex-wife.
Have you spoken to her?
I'm just curious to hear how she reacted to your plan.
I remain optimistic.
You should know that if at any moment you feel unsafe around my son again,
I've told them to keep that suite at the South Fork on reserve for you.
I'm fine.
But thank you, Conrad.
All right.
Really?
Okay, that's good to know.
Thanks for the info.
Please.
Hear me out.
Why would I want to listen to someone who fired me?
Your father forced my hand.
If he had moved forward with his lawsuit, the magazine would have folded.
I'm trying to save it...
- For both of us.
- Yeah, well, both of us are no longer there to fight for it, are we?
That's why I wanted to see you.
What do you know of Conrad's relationship to my father?
Probably the same as you.
A while back, your dad had some investments at Grayson Global.
But they haven't been in touch in years.
Then what would he want with Pascal's attention now?
I don't know.
But he's certainly forming a lot of new partnerships.
One in particular I plan to get to the bottom of.
Keep in touch.
[ Laughs ]
Jimmy:
Very nice.
- I want to be, yeah.
- You gonna live there?
Charlotte, your friends were asking for you on the veranda.
- Oh.
Nice meeting you, Mr. Brennan.
- And a Happy Birthday to you.
You're the spitting image of your mom.
[ Chuckles ]
I didn't mean to crash your party.
I just need your approval on these paint chips your son selected.
Oh, well, I'm afraid that he and I are going to have to discuss his choices.
No problem.
It can wait.
[ Inhales deeply ]
[ Sighs ]
I... couldn't help but notice you staring at me just like that in the gallery.
I beg your pardon?
Woman:
It's time to open presents!
Well, it took me till now to pick up on it.
Come on, everyone!
I understand.
I mean, you're the ex-governor's wife.
You have to keep up appearances.
I respect that.
You're mistaken, Mr. Brennan.
Maybe I am.
But I don't think so.
Excuse me.
I have guests to attend to.
Go.
Make your little girl's dreams come true.
Good night.
- Put it away.
- Nolan:
Calm down.
Talk to me.
Always hiding behind technology, afraid that everyone will find out what a freak you really are.
I said put it away!
[ Breathes deeply ]
And that's when you hulked out on my cell.
I hope that's the only thing I broke.
[ Chuckles ] Other than my ego?
Look, thankfully, my phone bore the brunt of your wrath because you made it terrifyingly clear that you did not want to be followed when I tried to stop you from going back into the lion's den.
I'm so sorry, Nolan.
I can't believe I said those things to you.
I can handle it.
What I can't handle is you flying without a net.
I mean, do you even know what Conrad's master plan is?
Not yet.
Oh, God, I wish I could just keep you locked up here until the full moon passes.
I do have my guest room back.
[ Sighs ]
Aiden certainly left enough crap here.
You think he would've mastered the art of packing at this point.
Though my pilot said he never showed up, so...
I don't know.
You think maybe he's coming back for it?
Was this in his room?
Yeah.
Why?
It goes with Takeda's sword.
I was the only one who had this.
You do things that aren't you during these blackouts.
What if you planted it for Niko to find?
And if she did, she knows that Aiden killed her father.
[ Sighs ]
I've got to go.
Aiden.
Aiden.
Okay.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
[ Breathing heavily ]
I knew you'd come.
Let him go, Niko.
Not gonna happen.
He's guilty of too many things.
Like killing my father, lying to me about it, choosing a failure over me.
- You're out of your league.
- You're out of practice, even if we were both trained by the same great man.
But only one of us was his favorite.
[ Both grunting ]
Aiden:
Emily, no!
She doesn't deserve to die.
[ Breathing heavily ]
Emily.
No.
You have every right to want to see me dead, but killing me or Emily won't give you the peace you're after.
I loved you...
And you betrayed me
- and my father.
- No.
Your father died by his own code.
Don't let the same happen to you.
Please, Niko.
Go.
Can I get you anything else?
Once upon a time, you all made the best sidecars.
- Which means you knew my father.
- Mm-hmm.
Well, those were his specialty.
So, I can't promise that I've got his skills,
- but I'm happy to try for a loyal customer.
- I'm fine, thanks.
I just wanted to stop by for old times' sake before leaving town.
Okay.
Is that your boy?
Yeah.
It's Carl.
Named for my dad, actually.
Great smile.
Stevie Grayson.
Jack...
Porter, obviously.
So you're Conrad's first wife, huh?
We all make mistakes, right?
[ Chuckles softly ]
At least you were smart enough to leave him behind.
Spoken like someone who knows him.
I wish I didn't.
[Chuckles]
He's just caused a lot of problems for my family.
How so?
It's long story.
I'll save it for next time you're in town.
Hey.
Looks like it's time to get the little man to bed.
All right.
Come on.
- Babysitter:
Bye, Carl!
- Thanks so much.
Sure.
No problem.
It was nice to meet you, Stevie.
You, too, Jack.
[ Speed-dialing ]
Rachel, it's me.
Cancel my flight back to L.A.
And get me Conrad Grayson's cell number.
You deliberately defied me!
Continuing to employ that man, after I specifically asked you to fire him!
I know what you told me, all right?
I couldn't do it.
- You have to do it.
- No, actually, I don't have to.
And after listening to him, uh --
Maybe he's not a monster anymore, okay?
He's got regrets.
He's got things in life he wishes he had done differently.
Why are you choosing to hurt me in this way?
I'm not, Mom.
I'm --
I'm choosing to get to know him a little better.
There is nothing left to know.
He came to my home this evening -- my house.
He made advances toward me.
And I saw in him the same heinous man who drew me in all those years ago.
It is me who's suffering, Patrick.
Not him, like you wanted.
Jimmy:
Like you wanted?
Forgot my tool belt.
Look, Jimmy, we -- we should talk.
It's a little too late for that.
I can't believe I didn't figure it out sooner.
Vicky Harper.
Been a long time.
And you must be the kid that she stole from me.
Quite the happy family reunion, huh?
Hey, kid.
Did your dear mom ever mention to you how she used me back then?
How she took advantage of my help to get what she needed out of life.
And how did she thank me?
By giving you away.
I was 15 years old, and I was looking for someone to trust, and you preyed on that.
You raped me.
You knocked on my door that night.
We had a drink.
We hung out.
You said you were feeling adventurous -- that you wanted me down in that basement.
[ Crying ] Oh, you bastard!
- Don't you dare walk away from me.
- No!
Keep your hands off me!
Get your hands off her!
[ Both grunting ]
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
We need to call an ambulance.
[ Breathing heavily ]
And he pushes my face into the cold concrete, and he whispers, "relax, honey."
Relax, honey.
[ Weakly ] Help me.
Relax, honey.
I'm fine, Emily.
You can go.
- Aiden --
- I don't want to hear it.
I guess I should be thanking you for saving my life...
But I wouldn't have been in jeopardy if you hadn't have planted that sword.
- Do you hate me that much?
- Of course I don't.
Then why do it?
I don't know.
But what I did...
[ Sighs ] That wasn't me.
I've been blacking out.
Are you seriously gonna blame this on some kind of mental break?
You think I wanted you dead?
It's like whatever...
state I was in,
I could see our reality.
I'm never gonna give up my plan.
I can't give you a family, a normal life.
So...
[ Sniffles ]
I don't know.
Maybe I was trying to push you away.
So why show up yesterday and throw yourself at me, looking for some kind of reconciliation?
Or is that news to you, too?
And just so you know,
I never needed any of those things.
I just needed you.
But you never gave me a choice, Emily.
Get help...
Before you do something else you'll regret.
My party was a blast, Daniel.
Sadly, no potential boyfriends, but, still, thank you.
[ Chuckles ] Stay single, Charlotte.
Life's far easier that way.
I think Emily's out to get me.
A bellhop at the South Fork told me that she and Dad are working together on something.
Why would she trust him when his mistress shot her?
I'm not sure.
But, uh...
They got close when he thought he was dying.
And -- and you know he always wanted me to marry Emily.
Listen, I need you to help me with something.
What do you want me to do?
Voulez is Dad's new base of operations.
Okay?
Now that you're working there, find out all you can about what he's up to.
All right?
Like I said, it's just you and me now.
The police called with an update.
The coroner said that Jimmy died from massive blood loss following a fall from his ladder.
He ruled it an accident.
Right, it's... an accident.
We're not guilty of anything, Patrick.
What you did, you did to protect me.
Yeah.
But still...
Standing there tonight, watching my father die...
What is wrong with us?
We're victims of our world.
Of men like Jimmy Brennan.
But this dark chapter in our lives is finally over, and we can move on.
I don't know if I can.
Please sign it as you agreed.
I've had a long night and would like some solitude in my home.
Well, there may be a slight wrinkle.
What game are you playing now?
Sorry I'm late, Conrad.
How low you must have stooped to put this one on your legal team.
Oh, she's not joining my legal team.
She's merely here to impart some pertinent information.
Copies of the Grayson manor property deed.
It turns out that the land was actually purchased by Conrad before our divorce was final.
And while I may not have gotten much money in the split,
I did get all undeveloped real-estate holdings.
This house belongs to me.
And I will fight you until my last breath.
Let's hope that's sooner rather than later.
But until then, I own this place.
And I want you out by the end of the week.
Homeless...
At your age, Victoria -- What a pity.
And you.
You're an idiot if you think this makes us partners.
You wreak havoc in the lives of others, and that is about to catch up to you.
Nolan:
Doctor's still out on your psychosis?
She called.
The anomaly in my scan isn't causing the blackouts.
Well...
I've been worried sick about you.
And then, uh...
Something occurred to me about your past.
- Someone, actually.
- Nolan...
Look, you have to face the possibility.
[ Sighs ] I know.
My mother.
She was your age when she had her first break, wasn't she?
When she tried to drown me.
[ Inhales deeply, sighs ]
If nothing ever worked for her...
What hope is there for me?
Don't do that to yourself.
- There are people here to help.
- Who I'm driving away.
I lashed out at you.
I jeopardized Aiden's life.
I'm starting to go after the wrong people, Nolan.
[ Breathing shakily ]
What am I gonna do?
[ Sighs ]
Okay.
Great, thanks.
I just need the loan approved, and then I can make the offer on the house.
What?
The guy says I should have it in a couple days.
[ Chuckles ]
Oh, but then I won't be here to celebrate with you.
I know.
I'll bring you something for the house back from Paris.
You sure you know what you're doing?
I have to force my father to see me.
That's the only way he'll hear me about Conrad.
- All right.
- I'll call you when I land.
Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
You can't get enough of the old place, can you?
I'd actually like to hear the stories you alluded to last night.
About Conrad?
Um...
It's not really any of your business.
Actually, it is.
Why?
Because, Jack...
I'm your mother.
Previously on Revenge...
- You set me up!
- I'm sorry.
[ Gunshots ]
I know it was you, Daniel.
I'm not going anywhere.
- We can build a future together.
- This is my future.
You're ending this with me?
I thought I could avenge my father's death by myself, but I can't.
I need you to help me.
Conrad is suing Voulez for libel.
I'm willing to drop my suit just as soon as you fire my son.
- If you think we're going to cave to your threats--
- I'll do it.
Jimmy Brennan?
Heard of him?
If I'm to believe what's in this police report, he may also go by "Dad."
- What did Jimmy Brennan do to you?
- He kisses me.
When I try to pull away, he pushes my face into the concrete.
I was expecting to see the former governor's wife.
I'm the first Mrs. Grayson.
- Are you okay?
- Since my head injury,
I'm getting a little dizzy sometimes.
You were marvelous last night, Mrs. Grayson.
Emily:
Of all the weapons we take into battle, there is none more powerful than the mind.
It holds our instincts and our training and allows us to distinguish friend from foe, love from hate.
Dr. Sturman:
Hold perfectly still, Mrs. Grayson.
But if that weapon is unsound, it is by no means disarmed.
For the mind is all the more dangerous when damaged.
And there's no guarantee that it won't choose itself as its next victim.
Dr. Sturman:
Physically, you've recovered beyond expectation.
With regard to your head trauma, there are no permanent neurological problems evident.
However, there is a bit of swelling between the frontal and the left temporal lobes.
Would that explain the pounding in my ears, the blackouts?
I'm not a neurologist, Emily.
But the lab forwarded the results to one.
He'll have a better analysis for you tomorrow.
And until then, what do I do?
I...
I could be a risk to myself, to others.
Given your state of mind, maybe talking with someone would help.
At the least, it may help you remember what happened.
Because you still can't recall anything, right?
Conrad:
I'm glad to see I am still welcome.
I thought you'd have changed the locks by now.
Well, I have more important things on my mind than your departure, Conrad.
As have I while I've been staying at the South Fork.
I can only imagine what you've been up to.
Aside from having our son fired for your amusement, I mean.
Actually...
I've come to care about my new venture.
And, so that I may approach it with a clear mind,
I wanted to pop by in anticipation of convening our attorneys to cement our divorce tomorrow.
Oh, I assume, as always, my house will be the first thing you'll fight me over.
Why infringe on the beautiful memories of our first divorce by retreading the same duels during our second one?
Mrs. Grayson, there's been a fire at the gallery.
Margaux:
I still don't think we should have let ourselves in.
Ah, the realtor was late.
Besides, I needed to check for security issues.
Using break-in skills I was unaware of.
[ Cellphone chimes ]
Oh, my account manager just quit.
That's the third person to leave since they heard of Conrad's maneuver.
Do not say "I told you so."
I'm taking the wait-and-see approach.
That's what I did when Conrad bought into the bar last year.
This is just to hurt Daniel.
Not me.
All right, look.
No more Conrad talk.
[ Chuckles ]
I don't want to bring in bad mojo right off the bat, 'cause...
[ Breathes deeply ]
I think this might be the place.
But you've only seen two houses.
I know, but my dad said that when you're looking, the first one you like is the one you should buy.
Though...
Are you sure you'd want to live here?
I know it's nowhere near what you're accustomed to.
I came here to start a new life and to leave the one I'd grown accustomed to in France far behind.
Since it's my birthday tomorrow and you probably forgot again,
I decided I'd just tell you what to get me.
Okay, guilty as charged.
So you name it, and it's yours.
I was rejected from the design institute.
I thought I had a shot, but I guess they thought I lacked experience.
So I was hoping you could find something for me at Voulez.
You want my job?
[ Chuckles ] 'Cause it's available.
Seems there's no end to Dad's insecurity.
He got me fired and took my stake in the magazine.
I'm so sorry, Daniel.
At least use it to your advantage.
I guarantee he'll flex his sagging muscles to help you.
But you know what?
I'd rather spend my time throwing you an epic birthday party.
You can't pull all that together in one day.
You deserve it, Sis.
After all, seems pretty clear it's me and you against the world.
What happened?
I came here last night to work, try to deal with what you told me, and I, uh...
Well, I got so upset that I, uh...
This is my fault.
I'm sorry.
No.
No, no, no.
It's my fault.
You should go, though, all right?
Let me deal with this.
No.
We're in this together.
Wow.
Somebody really did a number on this place, huh?
[ Sighs ]
I'm Jimmy Brennan, the contractor you called.
I don't know how you heard about me.
It must've been good, right?
Revenge S03E58 "Payback"
Hey.
Are those Aiden's?
Where's he going?
Wherever he tells my jet to take him.
Is he here?
Since I knew you were coming over,
I told him to scram.
I didn't want to confuse an already confusing situation.
Did you want to say goodbye to him?
[ Sighs ] No.
It's probably best this way, especially since I don't know what I'm doing half the time.
Which brings us to why you wanted twelve hours of South Fork security-cam footage.
Okay.
Here you are on the phone.
Any idea who you were talking to?
[ Emily sighs ] No.
Well, I bet Conrad does.
[ Keyboard clacks ]
Picks up in the hallway.
You go in.
Conrad leaves.
[ Keyboard clacks ]
At least he was a gentleman.
He didn't come back till 7:00.
When I woke up.
What is going on with you, Ems?
Blackouts?
Colluding with Conrad?
My C.A.T. scan showed swelling.
When that goes down, I'm sure whatever this is will stop.
Yeah, but is that what the doctor told you or what you wanted to hear?
She's sending my results to a specialist.
Maybe you should talk to a therapist.
You know I can't risk telling a stranger the truth.
Yeah, but isn't that a risk you're already taking?
I have survived on my own this long.
Trust me.
I can handle it.
[ Cellphone ringing ]
You sure about that?
Who do you know in Los Angeles?
- Hello?
- Emily?
Stevie Grayson.
- It's nice to talk to you again.
- Yeah?
I'm in town, and I'm ready to process your divorce.
[ Sighs ]
I begged you to leave well enough alone.
Yeah, that was before you told me what happened --
Before you told me that you were forced to sacrifice me, move across the ocean to stay away from that guy.
And I spent my life building a world to escape what he did.
And now he is in our space.
- I should never have told you what happened.
- Why?
So I wouldn't find out what a monster he was?
Or that I'm a child of rape?
[ Inhales sharply ]
- I'm gonna kill him.
- Patrick.
Please...
Don't do anything.
If I lost you because of that man...
You are the one good thing that came out of the worst time of my life.
It's why I hold you so dear.
Now, I want you to fire that man now.
Jimmy:
All right.
Okay.
All right.
Got it.
Daniel:
Charlotte loves his music.
You really think you can get him?
For Daniel Grayson, I'll clone him if I have to.
[ Chuckles ]
Ah, there she is.
Larissa, this is my wife, Emily.
Daniel's told me everything you've been through.
You're lucky to have such a strong man by your side.
- You have no idea.
- Oh, I might.
He's pulling out all the stops for this birthday party.
For Charlotte?
That's nice of you, Daniel.
I do all I can for the people I love.
I'm gonna go check out where the band should set up.
Okay.
All right.
I heard you, uh -- you didn't come home last night.
I'm surprised you care, especially after you man-handled me.
Something I know you'll regret.
No, the only thing I'll regret is my marriage to you.
Conrad:
Because publishing my memoirs in serial form will only help to increase our circulation.
And with my pedigree, I can guarantee that Mr. LeMarchal will see us as something far more than a curiosity which lies an ocean away.
Wouldn't you agree, Margaux?
I need to speak to Conrad alone.
Now.
You have no right holding a creative meeting without me.
Oh, I can't help it if you're house hunting while I'm settling in.
I run things around here.
And not my father, as you seem to be implying.
You are absolutely correct.
He controls an international media empire.
Mm-hmm, which is why you're wasting your time hoping he'll care about this magazine.
Or maybe you just don't know how to get his attention.
- Emily?
- Yes.
- Stevie Grayson.
- Nice to meet you.
I thought it best that we meet someplace out of the way.
- Let's take a booth.
- Yeah.
I always like hiding out in this Stowaway.
I knew we'd get along great.
I used to come here years ago.
- Well, thank you for coming again.
- You kidding?
I've handled over a thousand divorces.
Nothing compares to a Grayson man.
Only they could get me to cross the country for a kindred spirit.
So, down to business.
Do you want to stick with the terms you suggested on the phone last night?
[ Inhales deeply ] Well, um, now that you've had the night to sleep on it, I, well --
I think I'd rather get your opinion.
Obviously,
Daniel cheating in your residence is grounds for annulment -- slam dunk.
[ Inhales deeply ]
You know, I -- [ Sighs ]
I don't know if I can go through with this.
Daniel and I -- yes, we've been having a hard time.
But...
Maybe I'm overreacting.
You know, I think we could work it out.
Really?
Last night, you were convinced otherwise.
In fact, you went as far to say that you were also in love with someone else.
No.
It's just Daniel.
Okay.
You can tell me whatever you want.
That look in your eyes...
Is a look of love, and not for the man you married.
[ Heartbeat pounding ] [ Sighs ]
[ Breathing heavily ]
I can't lose you.
Not to my plan or to Niko.
No, Emily.
Emily.
You can't do this now.
What is wrong with you?
Let go!
[ Panting ]
Look, I have to go.
If you want to have a sensible conversation...
I'll call you from London, but this isn't happening.
Have you been told where we're going?
[ Grunts ]
[ Grunts ]
What the hell are you doing, Niko?
Avenging my father, like I said I would.
You didn't think I'd find this under your bed?
Speechless?
That's funny, Aiden.
Because you knew exactly what to say when you showed up in Japan.
And when you tried to send me to Russia to kill someone for a crime you committed.
I can't believe I nursed my father's murderer back to health.
I didn't murder him.
We fought like warriors.
He attacked me, and I defended.
A death was inevitable.
I wanted to tell you, and one day, I would have.
But you had to help Emily first.
That was the code your father taught us.
- We go where we're needed.
- Oh, I'm counting on it.
I left her a clue just to see if she was really as good as he claimed.
And when she shows up here to save you,
I'm gonna kill her.
What?
You took someone I love on this spot.
You can watch while I do the same.
We'll tell him $5,000 a month in child support, another $5,000 in alimony, and --
[ Knock on door ]
Know what?
Uh...
I am back tomorrow.
Just sit tight.
[ Chuckles ]
I should have known you were behind this, Conrad.
So I assume Emily's whole divorce story was a sham?
Oh, no.
No.
Quite the contrary.
Emily would be wise to rid herself of my son.
That said...
I am glad you've come, especially as we're neighbors.
[ Chuckles ]
You're living in a hotel?
Yeah, while Emily's chosen to not follow through with her inevitable divorce, that hasn't stopped me from proceeding with my own.
And are you planning on treating Victoria as horribly as you did me?
Actually, that's why I'm here.
You know, I regret the way I handled things back then and would like this chance to make my sincere amends.
Hmm.
You know, I want you to read this.
I believe it makes ample restitution for my misdeeds...
With the added benefit of giving Victoria
- her overdue comeuppance.
- Hmm.
[ Chuckles ] There was a period in my life when I would have wanted nothing more.
But there's one problem.
I'm happy now.
Oh, well...
Why don't you give that time?
That always changes.
Yeah, most of my crew's on another job.
But I couldn't pass up the chance to slap Grayson on my client list.
Yeah.
[ Sighs ]
Hey, you got the power cut?
Uh...
There you go.
You're all safe.
So, you accidentally lit the blaze, huh?
Yeah, thanks for reminding me.
Yeah, don't beat yourself up.
Life's a bitch if you live with regret.
Yeah, well, you seem like the kind of guy who can just move past stuff.
Are you kidding?
There's a ton of crap I wish I'd done differently.
- Like what?
- Well, being a better husband.
Being a better father to the boy I see two days a month.
You, uh...
Just got the one?
Yeah.
Well, no, actually.
You want to talk regret -- back in the day when I lived in the Bronx,
I found out I had another one.
Found out, huh?
Must have been living the single life.
Hardly.
I wanted to be with his mother.
But she basically hid the pregnancy from me.
Just about killed me when I saw her pushing that stroller down Lexington.
Really?
Jimmy:
I mean, how would you feel if you suddenly realized that there's this part of you out there somewhere that you never got to know?
It's a damn shame.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I know.
It is.
But you didn't hire me to hear my life story.
It's just my long-winded way of telling you that I can get this all fixed up and no one's worse for the wear.
Yeah, no.
I guess you're right.
You know, sometimes it's better just to move past stuff.
And if I do my job right, you'll forget anything bad ever happened.
Stevie Grayson?
If that's what you still call yourself.
It is, Victoria.
How are you?
Well, it seems I'm condemned to revisit the horrors of my past, if you must know.
I'm sorry you see me that way, especially since the last time we spoke, you were on my husband's arm.
[ Chuckles ] I'm surprised you remember that at all, considering your level of inebriation.
[ Chuckles ]
But before I'm subjected to similar verbal assault, please excuse me -- It's my daughter's birthday.
Oh, the one fathered by David Clarke, right?
You certainly have made paternity quite a hobby.
Why are you here, Stevie?
For payback?
Because you still seem as out of sorts as you were all those years ago.
You won, Victoria.
Isn't that enough?
Though I guess you're still trying to take what I already have.
Hm.
Nolan:
Emily.
[ Footsteps approach ]
Ems.
Hey.
It happened again, didn't it?
I got worried when I didn't hear from you.
It just never occurred to me that you'd come home, I guess.
The question is, where were you before this?
I, um...
I remember being at the Stowaway.
With Conrad's first wife?
Emily, that was yesterday.
Do you even remember what you talked about?
Uh...
Apparently when I called her, not only did I ask for a divorce, but I almost told her about Aiden.
Phew.
So, blackout Em speaks the truth?
I'm aware of that, Nolan.
And are you aware that you are living with the enemy in a place where the truth could cost you your life?
[ Sighs ]
Maybe your mind just wants to throw in the towel, Ems.
[ Heartbeat pounding ] [ Breathing heavily ]
Ems!
Together: [ Distorted ] ♪ Happy Birthday to you... ♪
♪ Happy Birthday to you... ♪
♪ Happy Birthday, dear Charlotte... ♪
♪ Happy Birthday to you!
♪
[ Cheers and applause ]
♪ Make no mistake, these are animal urges... ♪
♪ Make no mistake, these are animal urges... ♪
♪ Make no mistake, make no mistake... ♪
[ Music continues ]
Nolan, call me as soon as you get this.
Well, Daniel threw a beautiful party.
I can't believe Charlotte's 19.
A birthday brings to mind many things.
For a parent, it stirs up memories of a day blessed by a miracle.
A joyful gift cherished for years to come.
Sadly, it's an experience you'll never have.
Which makes me wonder -- who were your parents?
Where did you come from?
And why are you still here?
Oh, I would be honored to help you find an internship.
The magazine needs more can-do spirits.
Thanks, Dad.
I'll make you proud.
Emily:
A job at Voulez?
What a wonderful idea, Charlotte.
And one I told you, like, 30 minutes ago, when you got here.
Of course.
Sorry.
And at the risk of repeating myself, kudos to you for taking my recommendation to call my ex-wife.
Have you spoken to her?
I'm just curious to hear how she reacted to your plan.
I remain optimistic.
You should know that if at any moment you feel unsafe around my son again,
I've told them to keep that suite at the South Fork on reserve for you.
I'm fine.
But thank you, Conrad.
All right.
Really?
Okay, that's good to know.
Thanks for the info.
Please.
Hear me out.
Why would I want to listen to someone who fired me?
Your father forced my hand.
If he had moved forward with his lawsuit, the magazine would have folded.
I'm trying to save it...
- For both of us.
- Yeah, well, both of us are no longer there to fight for it, are we?
That's why I wanted to see you.
What do you know of Conrad's relationship to my father?
Probably the same as you.
A while back, your dad had some investments at Grayson Global.
But they haven't been in touch in years.
Then what would he want with Pascal's attention now?
I don't know.
But he's certainly forming a lot of new partnerships.
One in particular I plan to get to the bottom of.
Keep in touch.
[ Laughs ]
Jimmy:
Very nice.
- I want to be, yeah.
- You gonna live there?
Charlotte, your friends were asking for you on the veranda.
- Oh.
Nice meeting you, Mr. Brennan.
- And a Happy Birthday to you.
You're the spitting image of your mom.
[ Chuckles ]
I didn't mean to crash your party.
I just need your approval on these paint chips your son selected.
Oh, well, I'm afraid that he and I are going to have to discuss his choices.
No problem.
It can wait.
[ Inhales deeply ]
[ Sighs ]
I... couldn't help but notice you staring at me just like that in the gallery.
I beg your pardon?
Woman:
It's time to open presents!
Well, it took me till now to pick up on it.
Come on, everyone!
I understand.
I mean, you're the ex-governor's wife.
You have to keep up appearances.
I respect that.
You're mistaken, Mr. Brennan.
Maybe I am.
But I don't think so.
Excuse me.
I have guests to attend to.
Go.
Make your little girl's dreams come true.
Good night.
- Put it away.
- Nolan:
Calm down.
Talk to me.
Always hiding behind technology, afraid that everyone will find out what a freak you really are.
I said put it away!
[ Breathes deeply ]
And that's when you hulked out on my cell.
I hope that's the only thing I broke.
[ Chuckles ] Other than my ego?
Look, thankfully, my phone bore the brunt of your wrath because you made it terrifyingly clear that you did not want to be followed when I tried to stop you from going back into the lion's den.
I'm so sorry, Nolan.
I can't believe I said those things to you.
I can handle it.
What I can't handle is you flying without a net.
I mean, do you even know what Conrad's master plan is?
Not yet.
Oh, God, I wish I could just keep you locked up here until the full moon passes.
I do have my guest room back.
[ Sighs ]
Aiden certainly left enough crap here.
You think he would've mastered the art of packing at this point.
Though my pilot said he never showed up, so...
I don't know.
You think maybe he's coming back for it?
Was this in his room?
Yeah.
Why?
It goes with Takeda's sword.
I was the only one who had this.
You do things that aren't you during these blackouts.
What if you planted it for Niko to find?
And if she did, she knows that Aiden killed her father.
[ Sighs ]
I've got to go.
Aiden.
Aiden.
Okay.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
[ Breathing heavily ]
I knew you'd come.
Let him go, Niko.
Not gonna happen.
He's guilty of too many things.
Like killing my father, lying to me about it, choosing a failure over me.
- You're out of your league.
- You're out of practice, even if we were both trained by the same great man.
But only one of us was his favorite.
[ Both grunting ]
Aiden:
Emily, no!
She doesn't deserve to die.
[ Breathing heavily ]
Emily.
No.
You have every right to want to see me dead, but killing me or Emily won't give you the peace you're after.
I loved you...
And you betrayed me
- and my father.
- No.
Your father died by his own code.
Don't let the same happen to you.
Please, Niko.
Go.
Can I get you anything else?
Once upon a time, you all made the best sidecars.
- Which means you knew my father.
- Mm-hmm.
Well, those were his specialty.
So, I can't promise that I've got his skills,
- but I'm happy to try for a loyal customer.
- I'm fine, thanks.
I just wanted to stop by for old times' sake before leaving town.
Okay.
Is that your boy?
Yeah.
It's Carl.
Named for my dad, actually.
Great smile.
Stevie Grayson.
Jack...
Porter, obviously.
So you're Conrad's first wife, huh?
We all make mistakes, right?
[ Chuckles softly ]
At least you were smart enough to leave him behind.
Spoken like someone who knows him.
I wish I didn't.
[Chuckles]
He's just caused a lot of problems for my family.
How so?
It's long story.
I'll save it for next time you're in town.
Hey.
Looks like it's time to get the little man to bed.
All right.
Come on.
- Babysitter:
Bye, Carl!
- Thanks so much.
Sure.
No problem.
It was nice to meet you, Stevie.
You, too, Jack.
[ Speed-dialing ]
Rachel, it's me.
Cancel my flight back to L.A.
And get me Conrad Grayson's cell number.
You deliberately defied me!
Continuing to employ that man, after I specifically asked you to fire him!
I know what you told me, all right?
I couldn't do it.
- You have to do it.
- No, actually, I don't have to.
And after listening to him, uh --
Maybe he's not a monster anymore, okay?
He's got regrets.
He's got things in life he wishes he had done differently.
Why are you choosing to hurt me in this way?
I'm not, Mom.
I'm --
I'm choosing to get to know him a little better.
There is nothing left to know.
He came to my home this evening -- my house.
He made advances toward me.
And I saw in him the same heinous man who drew me in all those years ago.
It is me who's suffering, Patrick.
Not him, like you wanted.
Jimmy:
Like you wanted?
Forgot my tool belt.
Look, Jimmy, we -- we should talk.
It's a little too late for that.
I can't believe I didn't figure it out sooner.
Vicky Harper.
Been a long time.
And you must be the kid that she stole from me.
Quite the happy family reunion, huh?
Hey, kid.
Did your dear mom ever mention to you how she used me back then?
How she took advantage of my help to get what she needed out of life.
And how did she thank me?
By giving you away.
I was 15 years old, and I was looking for someone to trust, and you preyed on that.
You raped me.
You knocked on my door that night.
We had a drink.
We hung out.
You said you were feeling adventurous -- that you wanted me down in that basement.
[ Crying ] Oh, you bastard!
- Don't you dare walk away from me.
- No!
Keep your hands off me!
Get your hands off her!
[ Both grunting ]
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
We need to call an ambulance.
[ Breathing heavily ]
And he pushes my face into the cold concrete, and he whispers, "relax, honey."
Relax, honey.
[ Weakly ] Help me.
Relax, honey.
I'm fine, Emily.
You can go.
- Aiden --
- I don't want to hear it.
I guess I should be thanking you for saving my life...
But I wouldn't have been in jeopardy if you hadn't have planted that sword.
- Do you hate me that much?
- Of course I don't.
Then why do it?
I don't know.
But what I did...
[ Sighs ] That wasn't me.
I've been blacking out.
Are you seriously gonna blame this on some kind of mental break?
You think I wanted you dead?
It's like whatever...
state I was in,
I could see our reality.
I'm never gonna give up my plan.
I can't give you a family, a normal life.
So...
[ Sniffles ]
I don't know.
Maybe I was trying to push you away.
So why show up yesterday and throw yourself at me, looking for some kind of reconciliation?
Or is that news to you, too?
And just so you know,
I never needed any of those things.
I just needed you.
But you never gave me a choice, Emily.
Get help...
Before you do something else you'll regret.
My party was a blast, Daniel.
Sadly, no potential boyfriends, but, still, thank you.
[ Chuckles ] Stay single, Charlotte.
Life's far easier that way.
I think Emily's out to get me.
A bellhop at the South Fork told me that she and Dad are working together on something.
Why would she trust him when his mistress shot her?
I'm not sure.
But, uh...
They got close when he thought he was dying.
And -- and you know he always wanted me to marry Emily.
Listen, I need you to help me with something.
What do you want me to do?
Voulez is Dad's new base of operations.
Okay?
Now that you're working there, find out all you can about what he's up to.
All right?
Like I said, it's just you and me now.
The police called with an update.
The coroner said that Jimmy died from massive blood loss following a fall from his ladder.
He ruled it an accident.
Right, it's... an accident.
We're not guilty of anything, Patrick.
What you did, you did to protect me.
Yeah.
But still...
Standing there tonight, watching my father die...
What is wrong with us?
We're victims of our world.
Of men like Jimmy Brennan.
But this dark chapter in our lives is finally over, and we can move on.
I don't know if I can.
Please sign it as you agreed.
I've had a long night and would like some solitude in my home.
Well, there may be a slight wrinkle.
What game are you playing now?
Sorry I'm late, Conrad.
How low you must have stooped to put this one on your legal team.
Oh, she's not joining my legal team.
She's merely here to impart some pertinent information.
Copies of the Grayson manor property deed.
It turns out that the land was actually purchased by Conrad before our divorce was final.
And while I may not have gotten much money in the split,
I did get all undeveloped real-estate holdings.
This house belongs to me.
And I will fight you until my last breath.
Let's hope that's sooner rather than later.
But until then, I own this place.
And I want you out by the end of the week.
Homeless...
At your age, Victoria -- What a pity.
And you.
You're an idiot if you think this makes us partners.
You wreak havoc in the lives of others, and that is about to catch up to you.
Nolan:
Doctor's still out on your psychosis?
She called.
The anomaly in my scan isn't causing the blackouts.
Well...
I've been worried sick about you.
And then, uh...
Something occurred to me about your past.
- Someone, actually.
- Nolan...
Look, you have to face the possibility.
[ Sighs ] I know.
My mother.
She was your age when she had her first break, wasn't she?
When she tried to drown me.
[ Inhales deeply, sighs ]
If nothing ever worked for her...
What hope is there for me?
Don't do that to yourself.
- There are people here to help.
- Who I'm driving away.
I lashed out at you.
I jeopardized Aiden's life.
I'm starting to go after the wrong people, Nolan.
[ Breathing shakily ]
What am I gonna do?
[ Sighs ]
Okay.
Great, thanks.
I just need the loan approved, and then I can make the offer on the house.
What?
The guy says I should have it in a couple days.
[ Chuckles ]
Oh, but then I won't be here to celebrate with you.
I know.
I'll bring you something for the house back from Paris.
You sure you know what you're doing?
I have to force my father to see me.
That's the only way he'll hear me about Conrad.
- All right.
- I'll call you when I land.
Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
You can't get enough of the old place, can you?
I'd actually like to hear the stories you alluded to last night.
About Conrad?
Um...
It's not really any of your business.
Actually, it is.
Why?
Because, Jack...
I'm your mother.
Previously on Revenge...
- You set me up!
- I'm sorry.
[ Gunshots ]
I know it was you, Daniel.
I'm not going anywhere.
- We can build a future together.
- This is my future.
You're ending this with me?
I thought I could avenge my father's death by myself, but I can't.
I need you to help me.
Conrad is suing Voulez for libel.
I'm willing to drop my suit just as soon as you fire my son.
- If you think we're going to cave to your threats--
- I'll do it.
Jimmy Brennan?
Heard of him?
If I'm to believe what's in this police report, he may also go by "Dad."
- What did Jimmy Brennan do to you?
- He kisses me.
When I try to pull away, he pushes my face into the concrete.
I was expecting to see the former governor's wife.
I'm the first Mrs. Grayson.
- Are you okay?
- Since my head injury,
I'm getting a little dizzy sometimes.
You were marvelous last night, Mrs. Grayson.
Emily:
Of all the weapons we take into battle, there is none more powerful than the mind.
It holds our instincts and our training and allows us to distinguish friend from foe, love from hate.
Dr. Sturman:
Hold perfectly still, Mrs. Grayson.
But if that weapon is unsound, it is by no means disarmed.
For the mind is all the more dangerous when damaged.
And there's no guarantee that it won't choose itself as its next victim.
Dr. Sturman:
Physically, you've recovered beyond expectation.
With regard to your head trauma, there are no permanent neurological problems evident.
However, there is a bit of swelling between the frontal and the left temporal lobes.
Would that explain the pounding in my ears, the blackouts?
I'm not a neurologist, Emily.
But the lab forwarded the results to one.
He'll have a better analysis for you tomorrow.
And until then, what do I do?
I...
I could be a risk to myself, to others.
Given your state of mind, maybe talking with someone would help.
At the least, it may help you remember what happened.
Because you still can't recall anything, right?
Conrad:
I'm glad to see I am still welcome.
I thought you'd have changed the locks by now.
Well, I have more important things on my mind than your departure, Conrad.
As have I while I've been staying at the South Fork.
I can only imagine what you've been up to.
Aside from having our son fired for your amusement, I mean.
Actually...
I've come to care about my new venture.
And, so that I may approach it with a clear mind,
I wanted to pop by in anticipation of convening our attorneys to cement our divorce tomorrow.
Oh, I assume, as always, my house will be the first thing you'll fight me over.
Why infringe on the beautiful memories of our first divorce by retreading the same duels during our second one?
Mrs. Grayson, there's been a fire at the gallery.
Margaux:
I still don't think we should have let ourselves in.
Ah, the realtor was late.
Besides, I needed to check for security issues.
Using break-in skills I was unaware of.
[ Cellphone chimes ]
Oh, my account manager just quit.
That's the third person to leave since they heard of Conrad's maneuver.
Do not say "I told you so."
I'm taking the wait-and-see approach.
That's what I did when Conrad bought into the bar last year.
This is just to hurt Daniel.
Not me.
All right, look.
No more Conrad talk.
[ Chuckles ]
I don't want to bring in bad mojo right off the bat, 'cause...
[ Breathes deeply ]
I think this might be the place.
But you've only seen two houses.
I know, but my dad said that when you're looking, the first one you like is the one you should buy.
Though...
Are you sure you'd want to live here?
I know it's nowhere near what you're accustomed to.
I came here to start a new life and to leave the one I'd grown accustomed to in France far behind.
Since it's my birthday tomorrow and you probably forgot again,
I decided I'd just tell you what to get me.
Okay, guilty as charged.
So you name it, and it's yours.
I was rejected from the design institute.
I thought I had a shot, but I guess they thought I lacked experience.
So I was hoping you could find something for me at Voulez.
You want my job?
[ Chuckles ] 'Cause it's available.
Seems there's no end to Dad's insecurity.
He got me fired and took my stake in the magazine.
I'm so sorry, Daniel.
At least use it to your advantage.
I guarantee he'll flex his sagging muscles to help you.
But you know what?
I'd rather spend my time throwing you an epic birthday party.
You can't pull all that together in one day.
You deserve it, Sis.
After all, seems pretty clear it's me and you against the world.
What happened?
I came here last night to work, try to deal with what you told me, and I, uh...
Well, I got so upset that I, uh...
This is my fault.
I'm sorry.
No.
No, no, no.
It's my fault.
You should go, though, all right?
Let me deal with this.
No.
We're in this together.
Wow.
Somebody really did a number on this place, huh?
[ Sighs ]
I'm Jimmy Brennan, the contractor you called.
I don't know how you heard about me.
It must've been good, right?
Hey.
Are those Aiden's?
Where's he going?
Wherever he tells my jet to take him.
Is he here?
Since I knew you were coming over,
I told him to scram.
I didn't want to confuse an already confusing situation.
Did you want to say goodbye to him?
[ Sighs ] No.
It's probably best this way, especially since I don't know what I'm doing half the time.
Which brings us to why you wanted twelve hours of South Fork security-cam footage.
Okay.
Here you are on the phone.
Any idea who you were talking to?
[ Emily sighs ] No.
Well, I bet Conrad does.
[ Keyboard clacks ]
Picks up in the hallway.
You go in.
Conrad leaves.
[ Keyboard clacks ]
At least he was a gentleman.
He didn't come back till 7:00.
When I woke up.
What is going on with you, Ems?
Blackouts?
Colluding with Conrad?
My C.A.T. scan showed swelling.
When that goes down, I'm sure whatever this is will stop.
Yeah, but is that what the doctor told you or what you wanted to hear?
She's sending my results to a specialist.
Maybe you should talk to a therapist.
You know I can't risk telling a stranger the truth.
Yeah, but isn't that a risk you're already taking?
I have survived on my own this long.
Trust me.
I can handle it.
[ Cellphone ringing ]
You sure about that?
Who do you know in Los Angeles?
- Hello?
- Emily?
Stevie Grayson.
- It's nice to talk to you again.
- Yeah?
I'm in town, and I'm ready to process your divorce.
[ Sighs ]
I begged you to leave well enough alone.
Yeah, that was before you told me what happened --
Before you told me that you were forced to sacrifice me, move across the ocean to stay away from that guy.
And I spent my life building a world to escape what he did.
And now he is in our space.
- I should never have told you what happened.
- Why?
So I wouldn't find out what a monster he was?
Or that I'm a child of rape?
[ Inhales sharply ]
- I'm gonna kill him.
- Patrick.
Please...
Don't do anything.
If I lost you because of that man...
You are the one good thing that came out of the worst time of my life.
It's why I hold you so dear.
Now, I want you to fire that man now.
Jimmy:
All right.
Okay.
All right.
Got it.
Daniel:
Charlotte loves his music.
You really think you can get him?
For Daniel Grayson, I'll clone him if I have to.
[ Chuckles ]
Ah, there she is.
Larissa, this is my wife, Emily.
Daniel's told me everything you've been through.
You're lucky to have such a strong man by your side.
- You have no idea.
- Oh, I might.
He's pulling out all the stops for this birthday party.
For Charlotte?
That's nice of you, Daniel.
I do all I can for the people I love.
I'm gonna go check out where the band should set up.
Okay.
All right.
I heard you, uh -- you didn't come home last night.
I'm surprised you care, especially after you man-handled me.
Something I know you'll regret.
No, the only thing I'll regret is my marriage to you.
Conrad:
Because publishing my memoirs in serial form will only help to increase our circulation.
And with my pedigree, I can guarantee that Mr. LeMarchal will see us as something far more than a curiosity which lies an ocean away.
Wouldn't you agree, Margaux?
I need to speak to Conrad alone.
Now.
You have no right holding a creative meeting without me.
Oh, I can't help it if you're house hunting while I'm settling in.
I run things around here.
And not my father, as you seem to be implying.
You are absolutely correct.
He controls an international media empire.
Mm-hmm, which is why you're wasting your time hoping he'll care about this magazine.
Or maybe you just don't know how to get his attention.
- Emily?
- Yes.
- Stevie Grayson.
- Nice to meet you.
I thought it best that we meet someplace out of the way.
- Let's take a booth.
- Yeah.
I always like hiding out in this Stowaway.
I knew we'd get along great.
I used to come here years ago.
- Well, thank you for coming again.
- You kidding?
I've handled over a thousand divorces.
Nothing compares to a Grayson man.
Only they could get me to cross the country for a kindred spirit.
So, down to business.
Do you want to stick with the terms you suggested on the phone last night?
[ Inhales deeply ] Well, um, now that you've had the night to sleep on it, I, well --
I think I'd rather get your opinion.
Obviously,
Daniel cheating in your residence is grounds for annulment -- slam dunk.
[ Inhales deeply ]
You know, I -- [ Sighs ]
I don't know if I can go through with this.
Daniel and I -- yes, we've been having a hard time.
But...
Maybe I'm overreacting.
You know, I think we could work it out.
Really?
Last night, you were convinced otherwise.
In fact, you went as far to say that you were also in love with someone else.
No.
It's just Daniel.
Okay.
You can tell me whatever you want.
That look in your eyes...
Is a look of love, and not for the man you married.
[ Heartbeat pounding ] [ Sighs ]
[ Breathing heavily ]
I can't lose you.
Not to my plan or to Niko.
No, Emily.
Emily.
You can't do this now.
What is wrong with you?
Let go!
[ Panting ]
Look, I have to go.
If you want to have a sensible conversation...
I'll call you from London, but this isn't happening.
Have you been told where we're going?
[ Grunts ]
[ Grunts ]
What the hell are you doing, Niko?
Avenging my father, like I said I would.
You didn't think I'd find this under your bed?
Speechless?
That's funny, Aiden.
Because you knew exactly what to say when you showed up in Japan.
And when you tried to send me to Russia to kill someone for a crime you committed.
I can't believe I nursed my father's murderer back to health.
I didn't murder him.
We fought like warriors.
He attacked me, and I defended.
A death was inevitable.
I wanted to tell you, and one day, I would have.
But you had to help Emily first.
That was the code your father taught us.
- We go where we're needed.
- Oh, I'm counting on it.
I left her a clue just to see if she was really as good as he claimed.
And when she shows up here to save you,
I'm gonna kill her.
What?
You took someone I love on this spot.
You can watch while I do the same.
We'll tell him $5,000 a month in child support, another $5,000 in alimony, and --
[ Knock on door ]
Know what?
Uh...
I am back tomorrow.
Just sit tight.
[ Chuckles ]
I should have known you were behind this, Conrad.
So I assume Emily's whole divorce story was a sham?
Oh, no.
No.
Quite the contrary.
Emily would be wise to rid herself of my son.
That said...
I am glad you've come, especially as we're neighbors.
[ Chuckles ]
You're living in a hotel?
Yeah, while Emily's chosen to not follow through with her inevitable divorce, that hasn't stopped me from proceeding with my own.
And are you planning on treating Victoria as horribly as you did me?
Actually, that's why I'm here.
You know, I regret the way I handled things back then and would like this chance to make my sincere amends.
Hmm.
You know, I want you to read this.
I believe it makes ample restitution for my misdeeds...
With the added benefit of giving Victoria
- her overdue comeuppance.
- Hmm.
[ Chuckles ] There was a period in my life when I would have wanted nothing more.
But there's one problem.
I'm happy now.
Oh, well...
Why don't you give that time?
That always changes.
Yeah, most of my crew's on another job.
But I couldn't pass up the chance to slap Grayson on my client list.
Yeah.
[ Sighs ]
Hey, you got the power cut?
Uh...
There you go.
You're all safe.
So, you accidentally lit the blaze, huh?
Yeah, thanks for reminding me.
Yeah, don't beat yourself up.
Life's a bitch if you live with regret.
Yeah, well, you seem like the kind of guy who can just move past stuff.
Are you kidding?
There's a ton of crap I wish I'd done differently.
- Like what?
- Well, being a better husband.
Being a better father to the boy I see two days a month.
You, uh...
Just got the one?
Yeah.
Well, no, actually.
You want to talk regret -- back in the day when I lived in the Bronx,
I found out I had another one.
Found out, huh?
Must have been living the single life.
Hardly.
I wanted to be with his mother.
But she basically hid the pregnancy from me.
Just about killed me when I saw her pushing that stroller down Lexington.
Really?
Jimmy:
I mean, how would you feel if you suddenly realized that there's this part of you out there somewhere that you never got to know?
It's a damn shame.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I know.
It is.
But you didn't hire me to hear my life story.
It's just my long-winded way of telling you that I can get this all fixed up and no one's worse for the wear.
Yeah, no.
I guess you're right.
You know, sometimes it's better just to move past stuff.
And if I do my job right, you'll forget anything bad ever happened.
Stevie Grayson?
If that's what you still call yourself.
It is, Victoria.
How are you?
Well, it seems I'm condemned to revisit the horrors of my past, if you must know.
I'm sorry you see me that way, especially since the last time we spoke, you were on my husband's arm.
[ Chuckles ] I'm surprised you remember that at all, considering your level of inebriation.
[ Chuckles ]
But before I'm subjected to similar verbal assault, please excuse me -- It's my daughter's birthday.
Oh, the one fathered by David Clarke, right?
You certainly have made paternity quite a hobby.
Why are you here, Stevie?
For payback?
Because you still seem as out of sorts as you were all those years ago.
You won, Victoria.
Isn't that enough?
Though I guess you're still trying to take what I already have.
Hm.
Nolan:
Emily.
[ Footsteps approach ]
Ems.
Hey.
It happened again, didn't it?
I got worried when I didn't hear from you.
It just never occurred to me that you'd come home, I guess.
The question is, where were you before this?
I, um...
I remember being at the Stowaway.
With Conrad's first wife?
Emily, that was yesterday.
Do you even remember what you talked about?
Uh...
Apparently when I called her, not only did I ask for a divorce, but I almost told her about Aiden.
Phew.
So, blackout Em speaks the truth?
I'm aware of that, Nolan.
And are you aware that you are living with the enemy in a place where the truth could cost you your life?
[ Sighs ]
Maybe your mind just wants to throw in the towel, Ems.
[ Heartbeat pounding ] [ Breathing heavily ]
Ems!
Together: [ Distorted ] ♪ Happy Birthday to you... ♪
♪ Happy Birthday to you... ♪
♪ Happy Birthday, dear Charlotte... ♪
♪ Happy Birthday to you!
♪
[ Cheers and applause ]
♪ Make no mistake, these are animal urges... ♪
♪ Make no mistake, these are animal urges... ♪
♪ Make no mistake, make no mistake... ♪
[ Music continues ]
Nolan, call me as soon as you get this.
Well, Daniel threw a beautiful party.
I can't believe Charlotte's 19.
A birthday brings to mind many things.
For a parent, it stirs up memories of a day blessed by a miracle.
A joyful gift cherished for years to come.
Sadly, it's an experience you'll never have.
Which makes me wonder -- who were your parents?
Where did you come from?
And why are you still here?
Oh, I would be honored to help you find an internship.
The magazine needs more can-do spirits.
Thanks, Dad.
I'll make you proud.
Emily:
A job at Voulez?
What a wonderful idea, Charlotte.
And one I told you, like, 30 minutes ago, when you got here.
Of course.
Sorry.
And at the risk of repeating myself, kudos to you for taking my recommendation to call my ex-wife.
Have you spoken to her?
I'm just curious to hear how she reacted to your plan.
I remain optimistic.
You should know that if at any moment you feel unsafe around my son again,
I've told them to keep that suite at the South Fork on reserve for you.
I'm fine.
But thank you, Conrad.
All right.
Really?
Okay, that's good to know.
Thanks for the info.
Please.
Hear me out.
Why would I want to listen to someone who fired me?
Your father forced my hand.
If he had moved forward with his lawsuit, the magazine would have folded.
I'm trying to save it...
- For both of us.
- Yeah, well, both of us are no longer there to fight for it, are we?
That's why I wanted to see you.
What do you know of Conrad's relationship to my father?
Probably the same as you.
A while back, your dad had some investments at Grayson Global.
But they haven't been in touch in years.
Then what would he want with Pascal's attention now?
I don't know.
But he's certainly forming a lot of new partnerships.
One in particular I plan to get to the bottom of.
Keep in touch.
[ Laughs ]
Jimmy:
Very nice.
- I want to be, yeah.
- You gonna live there?
Charlotte, your friends were asking for you on the veranda.
- Oh.
Nice meeting you, Mr. Brennan.
- And a Happy Birthday to you.
You're the spitting image of your mom.
[ Chuckles ]
I didn't mean to crash your party.
I just need your approval on these paint chips your son selected.
Oh, well, I'm afraid that he and I are going to have to discuss his choices.
No problem.
It can wait.
[ Inhales deeply ]
[ Sighs ]
I... couldn't help but notice you staring at me just like that in the gallery.
I beg your pardon?
Woman:
It's time to open presents!
Well, it took me till now to pick up on it.
Come on, everyone!
I understand.
I mean, you're the ex-governor's wife.
You have to keep up appearances.
I respect that.
You're mistaken, Mr. Brennan.
Maybe I am.
But I don't think so.
Excuse me.
I have guests to attend to.
Go.
Make your little girl's dreams come true.
Good night.
- Put it away.
- Nolan:
Calm down.
Talk to me.
Always hiding behind technology, afraid that everyone will find out what a freak you really are.
I said put it away!
[ Breathes deeply ]
And that's when you hulked out on my cell.
I hope that's the only thing I broke.
[ Chuckles ] Other than my ego?
Look, thankfully, my phone bore the brunt of your wrath because you made it terrifyingly clear that you did not want to be followed when I tried to stop you from going back into the lion's den.
I'm so sorry, Nolan.
I can't believe I said those things to you.
I can handle it.
What I can't handle is you flying without a net.
I mean, do you even know what Conrad's master plan is?
Not yet.
Oh, God, I wish I could just keep you locked up here until the full moon passes.
I do have my guest room back.
[ Sighs ]
Aiden certainly left enough crap here.
You think he would've mastered the art of packing at this point.
Though my pilot said he never showed up, so...
I don't know.
You think maybe he's coming back for it?
Was this in his room?
Yeah.
Why?
It goes with Takeda's sword.
I was the only one who had this.
You do things that aren't you during these blackouts.
What if you planted it for Niko to find?
And if she did, she knows that Aiden killed her father.
[ Sighs ]
I've got to go.
Aiden.
Aiden.
Okay.
I'm gonna get you out of here.
[ Breathing heavily ]
I knew you'd come.
Let him go, Niko.
Not gonna happen.
He's guilty of too many things.
Like killing my father, lying to me about it, choosing a failure over me.
- You're out of your league.
- You're out of practice, even if we were both trained by the same great man.
But only one of us was his favorite.
[ Both grunting ]
Aiden:
Emily, no!
She doesn't deserve to die.
[ Breathing heavily ]
Emily.
No.
You have every right to want to see me dead, but killing me or Emily won't give you the peace you're after.
I loved you...
And you betrayed me
- and my father.
- No.
Your father died by his own code.
Don't let the same happen to you.
Please, Niko.
Go.
Can I get you anything else?
Once upon a time, you all made the best sidecars.
- Which means you knew my father.
- Mm-hmm.
Well, those were his specialty.
So, I can't promise that I've got his skills,
- but I'm happy to try for a loyal customer.
- I'm fine, thanks.
I just wanted to stop by for old times' sake before leaving town.
Okay.
Is that your boy?
Yeah.
It's Carl.
Named for my dad, actually.
Great smile.
Stevie Grayson.
Jack...
Porter, obviously.
So you're Conrad's first wife, huh?
We all make mistakes, right?
[ Chuckles softly ]
At least you were smart enough to leave him behind.
Spoken like someone who knows him.
I wish I didn't.
[Chuckles]
He's just caused a lot of problems for my family.
How so?
It's long story.
I'll save it for next time you're in town.
Hey.
Looks like it's time to get the little man to bed.
All right.
Come on.
- Babysitter:
Bye, Carl!
- Thanks so much.
Sure.
No problem.
It was nice to meet you, Stevie.
You, too, Jack.
[ Speed-dialing ]
Rachel, it's me.
Cancel my flight back to L.A.
And get me Conrad Grayson's cell number.
You deliberately defied me!
Continuing to employ that man, after I specifically asked you to fire him!
I know what you told me, all right?
I couldn't do it.
- You have to do it.
- No, actually, I don't have to.
And after listening to him, uh --
Maybe he's not a monster anymore, okay?
He's got regrets.
He's got things in life he wishes he had done differently.
Why are you choosing to hurt me in this way?
I'm not, Mom.
I'm --
I'm choosing to get to know him a little better.
There is nothing left to know.
He came to my home this evening -- my house.
He made advances toward me.
And I saw in him the same heinous man who drew me in all those years ago.
It is me who's suffering, Patrick.
Not him, like you wanted.
Jimmy:
Like you wanted?
Forgot my tool belt.
Look, Jimmy, we -- we should talk.
It's a little too late for that.
I can't believe I didn't figure it out sooner.
Vicky Harper.
Been a long time.
And you must be the kid that she stole from me.
Quite the happy family reunion, huh?
Hey, kid.
Did your dear mom ever mention to you how she used me back then?
How she took advantage of my help to get what she needed out of life.
And how did she thank me?
By giving you away.
I was 15 years old, and I was looking for someone to trust, and you preyed on that.
You raped me.
You knocked on my door that night.
We had a drink.
We hung out.
You said you were feeling adventurous -- that you wanted me down in that basement.
[ Crying ] Oh, you bastard!
- Don't you dare walk away from me.
- No!
Keep your hands off me!
Get your hands off her!
[ Both grunting ]
Oh, my God.
Oh, God.
We need to call an ambulance.
[ Breathing heavily ]
And he pushes my face into the cold concrete, and he whispers, "relax, honey."
Relax, honey.
[ Weakly ] Help me.
Relax, honey.
I'm fine, Emily.
You can go.
- Aiden --
- I don't want to hear it.
I guess I should be thanking you for saving my life...
But I wouldn't have been in jeopardy if you hadn't have planted that sword.
- Do you hate me that much?
- Of course I don't.
Then why do it?
I don't know.
But what I did...
[ Sighs ] That wasn't me.
I've been blacking out.
Are you seriously gonna blame this on some kind of mental break?
You think I wanted you dead?
It's like whatever...
state I was in,
I could see our reality.
I'm never gonna give up my plan.
I can't give you a family, a normal life.
So...
[ Sniffles ]
I don't know.
Maybe I was trying to push you away.
So why show up yesterday and throw yourself at me, looking for some kind of reconciliation?
Or is that news to you, too?
And just so you know,
I never needed any of those things.
I just needed you.
But you never gave me a choice, Emily.
Get help...
Before you do something else you'll regret.
My party was a blast, Daniel.
Sadly, no potential boyfriends, but, still, thank you.
[ Chuckles ] Stay single, Charlotte.
Life's far easier that way.
I think Emily's out to get me.
A bellhop at the South Fork told me that she and Dad are working together on something.
Why would she trust him when his mistress shot her?
I'm not sure.
But, uh...
They got close when he thought he was dying.
And -- and you know he always wanted me to marry Emily.
Listen, I need you to help me with something.
What do you want me to do?
Voulez is Dad's new base of operations.
Okay?
Now that you're working there, find out all you can about what he's up to.
All right?
Like I said, it's just you and me now.
The police called with an update.
The coroner said that Jimmy died from massive blood loss following a fall from his ladder.
He ruled it an accident.
Right, it's... an accident.
We're not guilty of anything, Patrick.
What you did, you did to protect me.
Yeah.
But still...
Standing there tonight, watching my father die...
What is wrong with us?
We're victims of our world.
Of men like Jimmy Brennan.
But this dark chapter in our lives is finally over, and we can move on.
I don't know if I can.
Please sign it as you agreed.
I've had a long night and would like some solitude in my home.
Well, there may be a slight wrinkle.
What game are you playing now?
Sorry I'm late, Conrad.
How low you must have stooped to put this one on your legal team.
Oh, she's not joining my legal team.
She's merely here to impart some pertinent information.
Copies of the Grayson manor property deed.
It turns out that the land was actually purchased by Conrad before our divorce was final.
And while I may not have gotten much money in the split,
I did get all undeveloped real-estate holdings.
This house belongs to me.
And I will fight you until my last breath.
Let's hope that's sooner rather than later.
But until then, I own this place.
And I want you out by the end of the week.
Homeless...
At your age, Victoria -- What a pity.
And you.
You're an idiot if you think this makes us partners.
You wreak havoc in the lives of others, and that is about to catch up to you.
Nolan:
Doctor's still out on your psychosis?
She called.
The anomaly in my scan isn't causing the blackouts.
Well...
I've been worried sick about you.
And then, uh...
Something occurred to me about your past.
- Someone, actually.
- Nolan...
Look, you have to face the possibility.
[ Sighs ] I know.
My mother.
She was your age when she had her first break, wasn't she?
When she tried to drown me.
[ Inhales deeply, sighs ]
If nothing ever worked for her...
What hope is there for me?
Don't do that to yourself.
- There are people here to help.
- Who I'm driving away.
I lashed out at you.
I jeopardized Aiden's life.
I'm starting to go after the wrong people, Nolan.
[ Breathing shakily ]
What am I gonna do?
[ Sighs ]
Okay.
Great, thanks.
I just need the loan approved, and then I can make the offer on the house.
What?
The guy says I should have it in a couple days.
[ Chuckles ]
Oh, but then I won't be here to celebrate with you.
I know.
I'll bring you something for the house back from Paris.
You sure you know what you're doing?
I have to force my father to see me.
That's the only way he'll hear me about Conrad.
- All right.
- I'll call you when I land.
Okay.
- Bye.
- Bye.
You can't get enough of the old place, can you?
I'd actually like to hear the stories you alluded to last night.
About Conrad?
Um...
It's not really any of your business.
Actually, it is.
Why?
Because, Jack...
I'm your mother.
And cut!
- Wow.
That was so amazing!
- Walter, you did a wonderful job.
Thank you, Kermit.
Did we get that?
- We got it.
- We got it, yup.
Movie's over, people.
Go home.
That is a wrap.
Okay, nice work, everyone.
Make sure to fill out your I-9s, and we'll see you on the next one.
So...
What do we do now?
Well, we're together again.
We got the theater and all our fans are back.
Yeah!
Actually, those were extras.
I saw a few tapping their toes.
Yeah, those were paid dancers.
Or...
Maybe since we're all here, now could be the perfect time for you and me to tie the knot, Kermie!
Well, I mean, maybe I could.
Hey, what's the camera still doing here?
Oh, no.
Disaster!
That can only mean one thing.
Doggone it, you're right!
It looks like they've ordered a sequel.
We're doing a sequel
We're back by popular demand
Come on, everybody, strike up the band!
We're doing a sequel
That's what we do in Hollywood
And everybody knows
That the sequel's never quite as good
A sequel Another feature attraction
Places, please Light the lights
Roll camera, "Action!"
I thought it was the end
But no, my friends, this is when
We get to do it all again!
Do it all again
Until the credits roll
We got another go to show them
We can do it all again!
We're doing a sequel There's no need to disguise
The studio considers us a viable franchise
We're doing a sequel The studio wants more
While they wait for Tom Hanks
To make Toy Story 4!
I thought it was the end
But no, my friends, this is when
We get to do it all again!
Do it all again!
Until the credits roll
We've got another go to show them
We can do it all again!
We're doing a sequel
Let's give it a go
With Hollywood stars
And more one-liner cameos
We're doing a sequel
I don't mean to be a stickler
But this is the seventh sequel
To our original motion picture
We're doing a sequel
Let's give it a shot
All we need now is a half-decent plot
Got it.
An epic love story between a very handsome, long-nosed purple thing and a beautiful chicken.
Gonzo with the Wind.
Does anybody have any other ideas?
It's about getting the Muppets back together again to stop an evil oil baron from demolishing the old studio!
Fozzie, did you even watch our last film?
It's about a frog who marries a beautiful, perfect pig.
And they have to kiss each other a lot!
I don't think Americans watch subtitled films.
Kermit, how about the Muppets go on a world tour?
That's perfect!
I thought it was the end
But no, my friends, this is when
We get to do it all again!
Until the credits roll
We've got another go to show them
We can do it all again!
We're doing a sequel
It's more of the same Let's give it a name
How about The Muppets Again?
It's the Muppets again with The Muppets Again
It's the
Muppets
Again!
- Okay?
- I'm okay!
Okay!
Enema-boomed.!
Hey!
Pepperoni!
Come on!
Let's dance.
It's time to light the lights.
Muppet news flash.
Constantine, the world's most dangerous frog, has escaped from a maximum security gulag in Siberia, Russia.
This move has leapfrogged Constantine to the number one most wanted criminal in the world, one place ahead of the mysterious Lemur.
Wow.
Thanks for seeing me at my regular booth, Muppets.
Big fan.
Huge.
Dominic.
International tour manager.
"Dominic Badguy"?
It's pronounced "Bad-gee." It's French.
It means "good man."
Oh, yes.
Listen up.
You're hot.
You're having a moment.
But what is inevitable about a moment?
it ends.
I don't want this moment to end!
That's why we got to get out there now and capitalize on this moment with a capital yeah?
I want you to conquer the world.
Do an international tour.
Show a global audience what you can do.
Yeah, that sounds great but I'm just not sure...
Wait a second, guys, listen.
I'd love to do that, too.
But we've barely gotten back together.
We don't want to mess that up.
Okay, I am inundated with offers of management at the moment.
One Direction, U2, Cirque du Soleil.
Just some of the acts I can list.
Wow, that's a good list!
And now, I wanna tour manage you guys.
I know you're the boss, Kermit.
I wouldn't interfere with that.
We would share our managerial roles because you've got a special bond with these little guys.
Sure.
President Clinton?
What?
I'm on my way, Number Two.
Great, they're taking the bait.
- Well, he seems like a nice guy.
- Yeah.
Humble and honest.
I just...
I think we have to get settled first, you know?
Hone the show, get some new material, and then maybe go on a world tour.
See you in Berlin.
Yes.
Auf Wiedersehen,
Number Two.
So...
What's it gonna be, Muppets?
Ready to be world famous?
No pressure, but I am a very busy man.
That's Rihanna.
I really should take this.
World tour!
World tour!
Well, I mean...
I guess we could always hone our acts on the road, and that would be okay.
Wouldn't it, Kermit?
World tour!
World tour!
Come on, froggy!
Okay, let's do it.
Dominic, you're hired.
Thanks, Kermit.
I mean, boss.
You won't regret this.
Is everybody here?
Yeah?
Okay, guys, guys.
Get them up and move them out.
All aboard, Dominic.
I didn't know there was still third class.
Third class?
How about no class?
Watch the heels!
Piggy.
Why do you need so much luggage?
For our honeymoon, of course!
For our what?
Let's go, guys!
That must be reverse.
Oh, well.
This way looks good, too.
Okay, Dominic, I thought we could start our world tour in London.
Or how about the world capital of comedy?
Berlin, Germany.
Germany!
Was that supposed to happen?
You guys are gonna love this place.
Okay, here we are, guys.
The Hole in the Wall Club!
"Die
Looks like they put the reviews up early.
Yeah, or is that the suggestion box?
"Hole in the Wall Club"?
More like "Hole in the Ground Club."
Okay, everybody.
So, we'll start at the bottom and work our way up.
I've booked us into cabaret bars and coffee houses all across the industrial cities of Northern Germany.
Dusseldorf, Hamburg, Mudburg, Vomitdorf.
Poopenburgen'?
Fozzie, we have a solid week booked in Poopenburgen.
This looks great.
And I think we should commend Kermit on his efforts.
Thank you, Dominic.
Thanks.
Or, if I might be so bold, maybe we could consider another venue.
Another venue?
To be precise, this other venue.
Look at that theater!
What?
No, no.
We don't have the money to rent the Berlin National Theatre!
We'll make our money back when we sell it out.
Kermie, I've always dreamed of playing the Berlin National Theatre.
"Ich bin ein Berliner."
More like, "Ein frankfurter"!
Watch it, buster.
Guys, I'm not sure we can do this, you know?
Okay, let's put this to the vote.
All those in favor of believing in ourselves, raise your hands.
That's not what I'm saying.
And all those in favor of just giving up.
I can't believe I'm voting for giving up.
Good.
Well, I'm glad we made this decision.
Wonderful!
So cool!
Isn't that exciting.
I can't believe it.
All right, gather round, troops.
Everybody?
Okay, guys-
Since we're playing such a big theater, let's stick with what we know.
We'll open with a cabaret number...
Kermit, when do I do the indoor running of the bulls?
Mr. Kermit, sir?
I would very much like to demonstrate my magnetic bomb-attractor vest.
Bunsen, why would you even invent one of those?
Why did I invent the unexpectedly exploding cupcake?
Hey, what about Muppet Ladder?
Muppet Ladder?
That's never, ever worked, Gonzo.
Last time we all tried that was 20 years ago and you ended up in a cast for six months.
Yeah, good times.
Kermit, what if I do four or five Celine Dion songs?
You know Celine Dion, she works in Vegas.
No, Piggy, there's no time for that.
What about the band's marathon jam session?
Drum solo!
Drum solo!
No drum solo!
Guys, guys, guys!
We can't just do whatever we want.
This is our opening night.
Let's play to our strengths, because...
Well...
Look, I didn't want to worry you guys but if we don't sell this theater out, it would mean the end of the tour.
What?
And maybe the end of us.
Great news, Muppets.
We're sold out.
What?
Fine.
I mean, great, great.
Well done, Dominic.
Hey, I have an amazing idea for an act.
It's called "The Indoor Running of the Bulls."
Gonzo, I've told you, that act is far too dangerous.
Actually, Kermit, I was asking Dominic what he thinks.
Good grief.
Dominic, Dominic!
Five songs.
"Sold out." Like we've sold out a show in 30 years.
Is this a good time to discuss our upcoming European wedding?
No, actually, I'm kind of busy right now.
Perfect!
I have 23 swatches for the seat covers for the reception, eight font choices for the menu, which, by the way, we are not serving flies.
Piggy, what are you talking about?
I'm just trying to involve you in some of the decision-making, dear.
What about being involved in the decision to get married in the first place, huh?
Kermit, you never let me do what I want!
Oh. yeah?
Well, what about what I want?
What about that?
I haven't even proposed yet.
- You can do that on our honeymoon.
- What?
That's insane!
Do you hear what you're saying?
Insane?
How dare you call your fiancée insane?
You are not my fiancée!
We are not engaged!
And, as a matter of fact, the way this particular conversation is going right now...
Well...
I'm fine with that!
Piggy.
Wait!
I'm sorry!
Get out!
Don't take it personally.
They still love you.
They just prefer me now.
Thank you, Dominic.
That's very comforting.
Do you know what I think helps sometimes in situations like this?
What?
A walk alone in the fog in former East Berlin.
Maybe along a deserted canal.
Well, I guess a quiet stroll is not a bad idea.
Let the others know I've gone, will you?
Sure.
I promise.
Thanks.
Corrine, come here!
Boo.
What just happened?
What?
Wait a second.
Hold on, hold on!
There must be some mistake!
Don't you know me?
I'm Kermit the Frog!
Silence, Constantine.
The game is up.
Who?
No, no!
Wait a minute!
I'm Kermit the Frog!
Guys, this is a mistake!
I'm telling you!
Hey, hey!
Hello!
Somebody!
Open up!
I'm an Amphibian-American!
It's not easy being mean.
Has anyone seen Kermit?
It's 15 minutes to curtain.
Hi, guys.
Look, it's Kermit, just back from his afternoon stroll.
Hi-lo!
I am Kermit.
What...
He's got a cold.
That's why his voice sounds a little bit different at the moment.
See?
Just calm down.
Just relax.
You are right.
Dominic is terrific!
From now on, let's do whatever he says.
All right.
Yeah.
Wow, that walk must have really helped.
Miss Pig, I have wronged you.
I humbly beg your forgiveness.
You're not getting off that easy, bucko.
Come on, Foo Foo.
Bad frog!
Bad frog!
What is this?
Let go, dog!
Animal, stop it!
Kermit has agreed that Dominic is right all the time, man.
Good.
So, now that Kermit agrees with me on everything...
- I am Kermit.
- Definitely.
Let's go and hang out backstage, yeah?
Okay, all right.
Come, little friend.
Let us get on with the show and enjoy our family-style adventure during which we shall bond and learn heartwarming lesson.
Perhaps about sharing, or waiting your turn, or the number three.
Right, Kermit.
Sure.
Flawlessly executed.
Bravo.
What did you expect from world's most dangerous frog and number one criminal, Number Two?
Yeah, I know.
You're number one, I'm number two.
I think you mentioned that before.
Now that we control the Muppet tour, Number Two, phase one of our plan is complete.
We are now positioned to carry out greatest...
- "Burglary."
- Yes.
Of all time, and pin it on those gullible Muppets, who will spend the rest of their miserable lives behind bars.
Tonight, we steal the painting and then we'll have all we need to steal the unstealable, the Crown Jewels of England.
Ensuring that my name goes down in history as greatest thief of all time!
You mean our names, right?
Of course.
My name first, then spacebar, spacebar, spacebar, your name.
Sure.
I'm number one You're number two
We're criminals at large But I'm at larger than you
I'm number one
You're number two
I believe in equality
As long as you get less than me
- I'm one
- You're one
You're number two
I'm number two.
You may think that you're smarter
But I'm smarterer than you
I'm number one You're number two
You're lucky to be number two
Not number three
I can see by the look in your eye
You want to get a bigger piece of the pie
One day you'll get your chance
But in the meantime
You've got to dance, monkey, dance!
Really?
I hate dancing.
Do it!
Dance, monkey, dance!
I'm number two He's number one
I can't believe I'm working for an amphibian
I'm number two He's number one
I'm number one!
You know life's gone to the dogs
When your boss is a frog
I can see it's just a matter of time
Before he's gone
And I'm at the front of the line
It won't be long till I get my chance
But in the meantime
I've got to dance, monkey, dance
Dance, monkey, dance
Now, watch me.
- I'm number one
- He's number one
- You're number two
- I'm number two
That's it, kid There you go
Now step aside This ain't your show
- I'm one - "I'm one"
I'm number one
Yes, we know
- I'm...
- He's...
Number one!
That's how it's done.
15 seconds to curtain...
Kermit?
Sure.
Okay.
Have you studied your Kermit tapes yet?
Of course not.
This is child's play for frog of my talent.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome...
"Study Kermit tapes." Nonsense.
It's...
Oh, no.
Kermit!
Introduce the show.
It's the Muppet Show!
With our very special guest star, Christoph Waltz!
What is happening?
Why am I flying?
- What the...
- We gotta do something!
Please welcome our first act,
Herr Christoph Waltz dances the waltz!
Darling, you set my world on fire.
Did somebody say "explosion"?
No!
He says I set his world on fire.
There it is again!
Wait for me!
Please!
Wait for me.
One more!
Keep Waltzing, Mr. Waltz!
Hey!
It was vertigo.
Not stage fright, if that's what you're thinking, Number Two.
Sure.
Right, now to cover our tracks.
Let's get out of here!
CIA.
Interpol!
What is the CIA doing here?
This is my jurisdiction.
Not to mention, my badge is bigger.
One of the stolen paintings was on loan from the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art.
So, this is CIA jurisdiction.
Also, this is my travel badge.
Here's my real badge.
You must have been looking at the wrong...
- Badge!
- What?
You've won this round, Pierre.
- My name is "Jean."
- Okay, Shawn.
It looks like we're gonna be working together.
But that doesn't mean I have to like you.
I didn't like you first.
I didn't like you before I met you.
So, what have we got?
Two priceless paintings stolen and one average painting of an obscure English colonel.
This has all the markings of the work of the Lemur.
What's a lemur?
Only the second most wanted criminal in the world.
And my personal nemesis.
Unfortunately for me, his identity is a mystery.
No, literally, what is a lemur?
It is also a rat-monkey from Madagascar.
Just as I suspected.
This coin is his calling card.
The Lemur, he is playing with us.
I have a delivery here for Mr. Eagle.
Right here.
And here's your rope.
You were saying?
Look at that.
"Muppets sell out in Berlin." Five stars!
Kermit the Frog is liking this news.
Choo-choo, yeah!
Tunnel.
It's not there.
You were wrong!
Not so fast.
Oldest trick in the book.
Write it in lemon juice, then simply apply heat to reveal Colonel Blood's map.
Of course, today, the Crown Jewels lie behind the most sophisticated security system on the planet.
And this map, along with Blood's key and locket, is the only way to get close to them.
Good work, Number Two.
What does it say about location of Blood's key?
Right.
Something, something.
"Finest wooden teeth."
That is not helpful.
Wait.
There's the name of a city here.
Madrid.
You've got the wrong frog!
Hey, hey, hey!
It's Constantine.
- What?
- He's back.
What are you doing?
I'm not Constantine.
My name is Kermit.
Constantine, always with the jokes!
Good old Constantine.
Always trying to pull a fast one.
Old friend.
Since you are back,
I guess you are in charge of prison again.
Here, take prison crown.
We have to readjust it again.
Sergei, you get on that.
Take, take.
Thank you.
Wait a minute.
I've known Constantine for years.
And he has never...
Even"
Said, "Thank you."
Because I am not Constantine.
- How dare you?
- He's not Constantine!
Let's throw him in the recycling compacter!
Yeah!
Throw him in the compacter!
But I'm already green!
Squash that frog!
Put the frog down.
Or I will deploy.
Where am I?
The Gulag.
A gulag?
Gulag.
The Big House.
The Big House!
Hit it, boys.

Listen, I'm telling you, you've got the wrong frog!
If you are not Constantine, why do you have that mole?
It's not real.
Someone glued it to my lip.
As far as authorities are concerned, you are Constantine.
Glue or no glue.
Make yourself comfortable.
You're going to be here a while.
I wouldn't be so sure.
My friends will be here soon!
Now, lights out!
Turn them back on!
I can't see anything.
You have to wait until I'm, like, out of the hallway.
It's figure of speech.
Okay.
It seems that Blood's key is hidden in a marble bust of his accomplice, Godfrey the Unknown, which is kept in the Statue Room at the Prado Museum.
Perfect.
We break in, steal the bust, destroy it and grab key.
Yeah, it's not that simple.
You see, no one knows what Godfrey the Unknown looked like.
Of course not.
He was second in command, so no one cared.
And there's 250 statues in that room.
That may be problem.
Let me think, Number Two.
Excusez-moi, Kerrme.
Do you have a moment'?
Kermit.
I just wanted to say that I accept your apology and I'm ready to put our little disagreement or whatever it was, behind us.
And, perhaps, I was a little too eager about our wedding...
Pig, I have question.
Am I wearing sign that says "Bother Me"?
What was that?
What was that?
I was in the middle of evilly plotting.
I do not like to be interrupted while evilly plotting.
If we're to get away with this, you've got to keep up appearances.
I am keeping up appearances.
If you want the Crown Jewels, stick to the plan.
Do whatever the pig wants.
Keep her happy.
Whatever she asks of you.
Stupid frog!
Stupid train!
I don't want to talk to you, Kermit.
I said, I want you out!
I don't think you know what you want.
Yeah, I do.
I just told you, I...
You're my lady and I'm your man, baby.
And that's why, if you stick with me,
I can give you what you want.
Baby, stop right there
Let me clear the air
Baby, look into these eyes Let me apologize
I know what you're thinking of
You're thinking, "Where's the love?"
Babe, the love ain't gone It's here where it belongs
I know what you're waiting for
Well, you don't need to wait no more
I can give you anything you want
Give you anything you need
I'll make your dreams come true
Give you anything you want

Kermie.
You are what I've always wanted.
Excuse us.
But we are all wondering, what's the set list for tomorrow, chief?
I don't care.
Do whatever you want.
What?
Is he serious?
Kermit, could I do indoor running of the bulls?
Sure, Zongo.
Who cares?
Wow!
Thank you, Kermit!
Kermie, if he can do his thing, why can't I sing my five songs?
Well...
You can.
Who cares?
We don't have time for all this stuff.
We're up to a three-hour show, Kermit.
You are forgetting one thing, small man with glasses.
I can give you what you want.
All right!
Okay.
Indoor running the bulls.
Won't the show be terrible?
Guys?
I'm so confused.
Where are you guys?
Looks like I'm gonna have to break out of here myself.
It's The Muppet Show, with our very special guest star, Lynn Redgrave.
Yes!
Hi-ho!
Kermit the Frog, here.
Hi-lo.
Kermit the Frog here.
The lovers, the dreamers and me
The lovers, the dreamers and cheese
Nailed it.
It's El Muppet Show, with our very special guest, Salma Hayek.
Hey!
- Would you look at that?
- No.
Good idea.
Yes!
Hello and welcome to El Muppet Show.
Please welcome our opening act, the Great Gonzo and the indoor running of the bulls!
Gonzo?
Gonzo, I don't want to do this.
What?
This is gonna be great.
Are you sure about this?
Nope.
Come on.
Let's go.
- Where have you been?
- On stage.
Why did the...
The bulls are out of control!
Who could have foreseen this?
Me.
I did.
Here they come again!
Okay.
Sorry about that, folks, but now put your hands together for Miss Piggy.
I don't believe it.
They've managed the impossible.
What an achievement!
Bravo!
Bravo!
What?
You mean you actually like this show now?
No!
They've made the show even worse!
- Bravo!
Bravo!
- Amazing!
Where is it?
It's got to be here somewhere.
Keep smashing, Number Two.
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm smashing.
Where is that key?
The last one. it better be in here.
He looks a little bit like you, Number Two.
Colonel Blood's key.
Nice of him to label it.
- So, where is the locket?
- There's more.
Of course.
That's where Blood's locket is.
In the vaults of the Irish National Bank.
Then I know where Muppet tour must stop next.
Dublin.
Drum solo!
A standing ovation?
I am Kermit.
I hope you enjoyed my show.
I love you, Madrid!
Wow, what an audience!
Great show, Kermit!
They loved me, Kermie!
They loved me!
Guys?
I'm not sure that was such a great show.
Like, what are you talking about?
That jam was, like, totally epic.
Exactly.
And I'm glad to say the Spanish reviewers disagree with you as well, Walter.
They loved us.
Five out of five Jamón serranos.
Those reviews really came out fast.
And Citizen Kane only got four Jamón serranos.
And more good news.
Pack up, everyone.
I've booked our next gig.
In Dublin.
Oh, great!
Now we all have time to rehearse.
Rehearse?
Let's celebrate.
Yeah!
Yes!
You deserve it, comrades!
Go do whatever you want.
Looks like we are busted.
Exactly what are we doing today?
I am doing my job.
All we need to do is look at the map with the blinky lights, and wait.
This is how it is done here in Europe.
In America, we use 3-D satellite LED displays.
Not cardboard with Christmas lights stuck through it.
A blinky light!
She is blinking!
Let's go.
What is this?
A toy?
This is my car, Le Maximum.
It is illegal now in most of the EU for its massive size.
It's so needlessly spacious, I feel guilty.
I hate Europe.
Madrid, here we come!
- Get out of the way.
- Stay on the road!
Interpol!
Watch out, everyone!
37 hours.
Not bad.
The Lemur.
I knew it.
This doesn't make any sense.
Why break in, smash some priceless busts and then not steal anything?
There must be something bigger going on.
But what?
I've got it!
Sorry. 2:00 PM.
My day is over.
Wait.
Those weirdos, the Muppets, were performing next to the crime scene in Berlin.
And here they are, performing right next to the crime scene in Madrid!
You know what that means.
- Yes, they love museums!
- No!
They're suspects!
Okay.
Overtime.
We must find these Muppets before they flee the country.
To the train station!
Hey, Larry, want a bite of my bocadillos?
What the...
Are you all Les Muppets?
Wow, those are big badges!
Thank you.
Come, come.
You must come with us to answer some questions.
Kermit, let's begin Describe the day you played Berlin
We rehearsed, and then we walked about
We ate bratwurst and sauerkraut
That night at 10:03
Were you inside the portrait gallery?
My alibi is watertight
The audience saw me sing all night
Monsieur, we know you did the crime
I was on stage that whole time
Ask who sang Rainbow Connection
Thank you, Kermit, no more questions
I think it's time for good cop/romantic cop.
Miss Piggy, you could end up locked inside
And now's your chance to save your hide
Gentlemen, I did not know
It's a crime to steal the show
Tell us how the art was taken
If you want to save your bacon
I haven't seen your missing art
All I've stolen is audience hearts
We'll catch the swine
That did this job
Give up the pig puns, creep!
Go jump in a lake, that's my suggestion
Thank you, Piggy, no more questions
I think she likes me.
Huh?
I don't think your puns are helping the investigation.
- You know, I think they did it
- No, they didn't
Yes, they did and we can pin it
If they did how did they do it?
If they didn't how did they didn't?
If they didn't then it's easy 'cause they simply didn't do it
If they did it, then I knew it but we've nothing that can prove it
Excuse me.
Let's go from the start
What do you know about the stolen art?
I didn't know there was a plan
Your accusation's far out, man
The chances of us committing a crime are less than .009
I can do an Elvis impression
Thank you, Muppets No more questions
- They didn't
- No, they didn't
There's no way they did the crime
- They couldn't, they're too stupid
- Not criminal masterminds
We do not know who did it But we know who didn't do it
So we know who didn't do it
Yes, we know who didn't do it
They're incapable of being culpable!
Hi!
Come on.
Let's go over the files again.
Stop digging escape tunnel, frog.
How did you know?
It's the first escape everyone tries.
That's the second escape people try.
Oh, boy.
Third way!
Give up, frog.
I have Netflix account with search keywords "prison escape."
I have seen every prison movie ever made.
Even the ones in space.
Yeah, well...
Hey, wait a second.
That's them!
That's my friends!
What happened to them?
"Dominic Badguy.
"An interview with the brains behind
"the Muppets' triumphant comeback world tour."
What?
It seems your friends do not need you anymore.
They have forgotten about you.
No, no, no.
They wouldn't.
They couldn't.
We're a family.
"Family"?
No one believes in family in the Gulag, frog.
People are only ever out for themselves.
Listen, Kermit.
We have annual lighthearted Gulag Revue coming up.
It is that, or they riot.
I thought you might help me.
The thing is, Nadya,
I'm sort of done doing that, but thanks for the offer.
This is not offer.
This is prison.
You are going to help me.
Rehearsals tomorrow, 4:00 AM.
Or I put you on The Wall.
"The Wall"?
Why would I be afraid of a wall?
Just direct the show.
You'll never escape.
What time did you say that rehearsal was?
Okay.
What about this comedian bear?
He is too stupid to be stupid.
He must be some sort of genius.
Maybe your "Lemur" hunch is correct.
Except for the fact that Les Muppets play tomorrow night at the Dublin Theatre.
Which just happens to be next door to the Irish National Bank!
Maybe your Muppet hunch is...
Correct.
It's almost as if we're...
Not so different after
all.
Come, come, mon ami!
We must follow Les Muppets to Dublin!
To Dublin!
Kremlin!
Putin!
No, what are you doing?
- Okay, number five, baby.
Blow.
- Come on.
- There you go.
You know the routine.
- Come on, Diddy Daddy!
Hey. guys?
Fellas?
Whoa, man!
Hey, did you see that?
Do you guys think that Kermit's been acting a little weird lately?
No.
You're probably right.
It's just me.
Bad frog.
Enough!
You're all terrible.
Fix this.
Or it's The Wall.
Of course.
Guys...
It's always good to start with an up-tempo song and dance and then go into a comedy routine.
But we like Boyz ll Men!
It is Big Papa's favorite song.
Lot of emotions in that song for him.
I'm not learning no other song.
I'm a triple threat!
A singer, a dancer and a murderer!
There you go.
How do you like that?
Drum solo!
Drum solo!
When do I do the indoor running of the bulls?
What about the band's marathon jam session?
Four or five musical numbers.
Quiet!
Now, look!
We are holding auditions tomorrow.
And if any of you have a problem with that, any of you, then my door is always open!
Thank you, Kermit.
This is what we've all been waiting to hear.
Teach us, Kermit.
We will do whatever frog say.
Put it there.
Good night, frog.
Nice work today.
Thanks, Nadya.
Even if your friends don't need you, we certainly do.
Good night.
- Good night, Big Papa.
- 'Night, Nadya.
- Good night, Carl.
- Good night, Nadya.
- Good night, Prison King.
- Good night, Nadya.
- Good night, Skullcrusher.
- Good night.
- Good night, Danny Trejo.
- Good night, Nadya.
No one believes in family in the Gulag, frog.
People are only ever out for themselves.
Well, well, well.
What's he up to?
Gentlemen.
I need this review to go into Friday's paper.
Super positive.
Five stars.
I won't be paid off for a review.
I'm a journalist.
I'm joking, of course.
Cash or credit?
- What was that?
- Rats.
Who cares?
Hand these tickets out to anyone who will take one.
In fact, you may have to actually pay people to come.
It's the Muppets.
It's not gonna be easy.
And I want a standing ovation.
Oh, dear.
Where does he keep all those suitcases?
Let's see here.
What's Kermit doing on the cover of this newspaper?
Dominic's the bad guy!
Dominic's the bad guy!
Fozzie!
Dominic's the reason we've been selling out our shows!
He's been giving away tickets and bribing journalists to write great reviews!
Why didn't we ever think of doing that?
I mean, that's terrible!
The question is, why?
And could it have anything to do with why Kermit's been acting so weird lately?
Hey, wanna see something funny?
Yes, Constantine, the world's most dangerous frog.
Fozzie, what does he have to do with what I just told you?
Nothing, but check this out.
Look, it's Kermit.
What did you do with Kermit?
Wait a minute.
Fozzie...
What if Kermit has been replaced by this Constantine guy?
Nah, that's impossible.
We'd all notice!
Wouldn't we?
Kermit?
Are you there?
Hello?
Kermit?
Everything's fine.
Let's get out of here.
Wait!
We should look around.
Kermit's got a big bomb collection.
Looks like he's planning some sort of comedy heist bit.
I hope not.
Those never work.
What's that?
Oh, no.
What, what, What?
What?
Oh, no.
- We got to get out of here!
- Yeah!
Not so fast.
Where's Kermit?
What do you want?
You have wocka-ed your last wocka, bear.
- Bad frog!
- Animal!
- Oh, good boy!
- Great job!
Thank you.
Quick!
The freight train!
Go, go, go!
We got to go back!
Warn the others!
I tried.
They didn't believe me.
It's our word against his and, well, he's fooled them all.
Should we go to the police?
We don't have any evidence!
I feel terrible.
I'm the one who talked Kermit into doing this tour in the first place.
I wish Kermit was here!
He would know what to do.
You're right.
There's only one guy in this world who can save us.
Only one frog who can restore order, bring justice, and set things right!
You are talking about Kermit, right?
Yes, Fozzie.
Kermit.
Good!
Great!
That's it, guys, that's it!
That's good, guys!
Come on!
And hit it hard!
Okay.
All right.
Yes.
Nadya?
I think perhaps we should, perhaps, keep it prisoners only.
Of course.
I just love Broadway.
But you are right, Kermit, as ever.
Okay.
Thank you.
Okay, fellas, listen up.
Here's who made the cut.
Sergei!
King!
That's you.
You are always right, my beautiful amphibian prince.
I will never let you go.
This is better.
What's wrong?
You only ever knit when you're stressed.
The bear, the little guy and their dog, they are onto us.
They got away-
How are we gonna spin this?
Comrades, I'm afraid I have bad news.
Walter and Fonzie have quit the Muppets.
Wait.
You can quit the Muppets?
Wait a second.
Walter quit the Muppets?
We just did a whole movie where he joined the Muppets.
Yeah, we sure spent a lot of time on it.
I'll say.
Maybe even at the expense of other long-standing, beloved Muppets.
Come on, Robin.
Coming.
Well, as the old saying goes...
The show must continue,
- in a timely fashion.
- Wait.
Fozzie and Walter are part of our family.
We can't let them go without a fight.
Right, Kermit?
I know this is hard, Gonzo.
Walter and Fonzie were my best friends.
Kermit...
Are you sure you're okay?
Yes, I'm fine, pig.
I could never lose you.
You complete me.
Kermie.
Guys, come on!
This is gonna be fantastic.
We should be celebrating!
Yes.
Remember, I can give you what you want.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, right.
- I'll keep that in mind.
- Say, has anyone seen Animal?
Does anybody else feel like we're traveling in circles?
There it is!
Finally!
Do you have evidence to frame the bear?
Excellent.
Where are the guards?
Stay here.
I'm going to check on the vault.
Stop it!
Colonel Blood's locket.
Of course.
Now grab it.
Shawn.
Someone's coming.
Abort!
I think I just saw something.
It's headed back towards the theater!
- That was close.
- Too close.
We need to move to final phase three. "Wedding."
Hey, Kermit, you can't go out there.
It's Piggy's Celine Dion number.
Did you see anything?
Not a thing.
It is my lunch hour.
It lasts six hours.
Excuse me.
Ladies and gentlemen!
I have an announcement!
What?
Kermit,
I'm in the middle of a song here!
Miss Piggy.
I have very important question for you.
Yeah?
What are you doing?
Do you wish to become Mrs. Piggy?
Or rather, Mrs. The Frog?
Kermie, I thought you'd never ask.
I really thought you'd never ask!
So?
What do you say?
It's beautiful.
Yes!
Yes!
Of course!
Yes!
I can't believe this!
After all this time, it was finally just so easy!
That's right, folks, it's the Muppet wedding the world has been waiting for.
We're putting our tour on hold...
What?
To be married in two days' time at the world's most romantic location, the Tower of London.
Here's a Muppet newsflash.
The years of waiting are over.
The biggest "Will they, won't they?" of all times has been answered with a firm, "They will."
Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy are to be married!
That's right, folks.
They're finally tying the knot.
Well, at least they didn't get the pot of gold.
No, they did not.
I have never been to a more ridiculous crime scene.
The comedian bear, he was here.
The Lemur.
He, too, was here.
Could the comedian bear and the Lemur be one and the same?
The comedian bear is the Lemur.
That is brilliant.
But why would he steal a bunch of old bones?
The bones apparently belonged to one Colonel Thomas Blood.
He was the only man to ever nearly steal the Crown Jewels of England.
Wait!
Where did the frog say he was getting married?
The Tower of London.
The comedian bear is planning on stealing...
- The Tower of London!
- The Crown Jewels!
The Crown Jewels.
Sir, where would you like the flowers?
Who cares?
Hey, chief.
Hi-lo.
We've all been thinking, and...
Well, after you and Miss Piggy get married, what's gonna happen to the tour?
And to us?
Well, now you guys have all the freedom you want.
You don't need me.
I'm done with Muppets.
But, hey, it's been a good run, right?
Good luck.
Kermit!
Did he just say what I thought he said?
What are we gonna do without Kermit?
The only thing we can do.
Pack up, go to the wedding, and head back home.
Foo Foo, it's always been a fight.
But this is so easy, it just doesn't feel right.
This is my dream come true
The day has come for us to say "I do"
There's nowhere else I'd rather be
Nothing in the world means more to me than you
I've waited so patiently
I knew you were the only frog for me
Always knew this day would come
It's written in the stars It's destiny
So how can something so right
Feel so wrong tonight?
After all we've been through
Why do I feel I don't know you?
We'll settle down and start a family
Have a mini you and a mini me
A little pink frog and a little green piggy
They'll learn to say hello and say goodbye
We'll grow gray and old
And live the quiet life
Just you and I
Hand in hand we'll stay together
Hey.
Look at that sky.
Forever and ever
So how can something so right
Feel so wrong tonight?
After all we've been through
Why do I feel I don't know you?
How can something so right feel so wrong inside?
How can something so good leave me feeling so bad?
How can my dreams coming true
Leave me lonely and blue?
How come the happiest day of my life is so sad?
How can I feel the high when I feel so low?
After all we've been through After coming so far
Is this my destiny?
Where is the love that's written
In the stars?
How can something so right
Feel so wrong tonight?
After all we've been through
Why do I feel I don't
Know you?
Oh, Kermie.
- Hey, the show's starting.
- Yeah!
Lady and gentlemen, good evening and welcome to the Gulag Annual Revue Show!
Escapo, you're up after the ballet.
Okay.
Kermit!
Kermit!
Kermit.
Fozzie.
Walter.
Animal.
We're here to rescue you.
Yes!
And we've got to go right now!
Yeah!
Hey!
I can't believe you're here.
It's so good to see you guys!
Kermit, listen.
An evil frog named Constantine has taken over the Muppets and replaced you!
What?
Constantine replaced me?
Yeah.
And he was working together with Dominic.
They're planning something terrible, but we don't know what.
But...
How could you not have noticed that he'd replaced me, Fozzie?
He looked like you and he talked like you.
Okay, he didn't talk that much like you, come to think of it.
But he said he had a cold.
Animal know.
"Animal know"?
You mean, all this time, I've been locked in a Russian gulag, no one, not one single person from the Muppets except Animal noticed I'd been replaced by an evil criminal mastermind?
It sounds worse than it was.
No.
It's as bad as it sounds.
I thought you guys had forgotten about me.
That you didn't need me anymore.
We'd never forget about you.
We need you more than ever, Kermit.
Good frog.
Late extra!
Late extra!
Read all about it!
Kermit and Miss Piggy to be married in London!
What?
Piggy?
Piggy's gonna marry the world's most dangerous frog tomorrow?
Piggy and the gang are in danger!
To London!
No.
Kermit!
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
I'm in a gulag.
Sorry about that, Ivan!
It's okay!
No problem, Kermit.
It's easy mistake.
Right.
Thanks for not shooting me!
Sure.
No problem...
Hey, nothing personal.
We have to escape, guys.
Tonight!
But how?
Kermit.
Do you know where these prop pickaxes and shovels are supposed to go for this big mining number?
Wait!
I've got it!
And now, folks, the Great Escapo!
Oh, no, you don't.
Nice try, Escapo.
I sure hope this works, Walter.
I have tried a lot of ways to get out of here.
This is gonna work, Kermit.
I'll see you on the outside.
Okay!
Gosh, I hope this works.
Thank you, thank you, everybody.
And now, we're going underground.
Working in the coal mine!
- Bravo!
Bravo!
- Bravo!
Oh, no.
Kermie!
I can't believe that worked!
We did it!
Great work, guys!
Now put the pedal to the metal.
We have a wedding to crash!
Yeah!
That's a nice venue.
The main entrance is too well-guarded.
I'm gonna need to get in some other way.
Here you go.
You're the new guy?
Yes, I am.
Next time, wear a uniform.
Right.
Wow, Kermit, you were like James Bond back there.
Thanks, Fozzie.
Okay, listen, guys.
Walter, you and Animal go look in the chapel.
Right.
- Fozzie, come with me.
- Yes, sir.
- Good luck, guys.
- You, too, Kermit.
Piggy?
Where is she?
Kermit, these are your clothes.
This tuxedo is too tight.
Someone's coming!
Hide!
Hide!
Which room am I supposed to be in?
Here it is.
I hate weddings.
What the...
There you are.
Well, don't just stand there gawping, Number Two.
Come in.
Let us take this convenient opportunity to review our plans.
Once you've stolen the Crown Jewels and framed the Muppets, ring the tower bell five times and we will rendezvous on the roof.
But what will you do when you're married?
Because the pig will know everything.
Once she's served her purpose, kaboom.
It will be bacon for breakfast.
Champagne fridge delivery.
Put it over there on the bear-skin rug.
Thank you!
It's show time.
Fozzie, are you okay?
Yeah, I think so.
How do I look?
You look fine.
You look fine.
Come on, we have to go rescue Miss Piggy!
Right!
Let's go!
The Lemur!
I have you finally!
And Constantine, the world's most dangerous frog!
No, no, no.
As you might say, case sol-ved!
Perfect!
Time for my annual eight-week paid vacation.
No, wait!
What am I supposed to do with them until the mobile holding unit arrives?
On holiday!
No, you've got the wrong frog.
And stay there!
And so you know, Number Two, I have hired us help.
The world's smallest team of jewel thieves.
Babies, meet your new boss.
Genius, I know!
Who would suspect babies of stealing Crown Jewels?
Look at their sweet faces.
Let's see.
Where am I seated?
I'll need an usher.
Usher?
ls there an usher?
Yes.
I'm the Usher.
Pig or frog?
What do you think?
I don't know, man.
Pig?
No.
Frog.
I'm related through marriage.
What kind of an usher are you?
You're up, little dudes.
Go, go:
Down.
Tip.
Come on!
What the...
Dominic.
Hey, Dominic.
Shut up.
The wedding, it's starting.
She looks beautiful.
Fozzie, we got to do something.
This is so frustrating!
Wow, would you look at that?
Now that's a poorly made car.
Let's get out of here!
I'm just happy for them.
Really happy for them.
- Would you please stop talking?
- Okay.
Dearly beloved...
What!
Code Red!
Code Red!
Oh, come on.
- Not a laser web.
- Pretty.
Right.
Go and get the suspend-y ropey thing.
- And my really cool skintight outfit.
- Yep.
Shawn, come back from vacation!
Constantine and the Lemur have escaped.
The Crown Jewels are in danger!
We are gathered here today to witness the union of this pig and this frog in Holy Matrimony before the presence of God.
Do you, Kermit the Frog, take Miss Piggy to be your lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, so help you God?
Yes.
Yes, I do.
And do you, Miss Piggy, take Kermit the Frog to be your lawfully wedded husband, in sickness and in health, so help you God?
I.-
I.-
Just say "I do."
This is what you've always wanted, right?
I do?
I'm sorry, is that a question?
No, it was not a question.
We have to do something, guys.
Kermit, we've got to get you close to Miss Piggy!
What does this do?
- What the...
- Piggy, it's me, Kermit.
Come on, we have to get out of here!
The wedding is off.
Oh, wow!
Like, I kind of knew he'd get cold flippers.
Excuse us.
No, Kermit!
What are you doing?
- Piggy, I will explain later.
- I cannot believe...
Come here, frog!
Where you going?
I'm sorry, my dear, forgive me.
What is going on at my wedding?
- Gotcha!
- What?
Animal, pull!
What is happening here?
Catch froggie!
Catch froggie!
Well, this is the best Muppet wedding ever!
Piggy, listen!
That's not me!
I'm me!
He's Constantine, the world's most dangerous...
Two Kermits?
Well, that explains a lot.
How can there be two Kermits?
Of all the ways to ruin a wedding, this has got to be the most creative.
Two Kermits!
No, just one Kermit.
Me.
No, no, no.
Do not listen to him!
I am the real Kermit.
That's ridiculous!
I am Kermit the Frog!
No, I am Kermit the Frog!
Hi-lo, Kermit the Frog, here.
"Hi-lo?" It's "Hi-ho!"
Would every Kermit be quiet!
Well, there's only one sure way to settle this.
First Kermit.
Will you marry me?
Yes, of course, let's go!
The helicopter is waiting, my love!
And you, the other Kermit...
Will you marry me?
Well, I mean, I...
I would.
I mean, I could.
It's...
That's my Kermit!
That's our frog!
Kissy-kissy!
That is right, Muppets!
I am Constantine, the world's most dangerous frog and number one criminal!
And a thousand times more frog than this Kermit person!
And now,
I have only one thing to say to you fools!
Good night, folks!
What is that?
It's a bomb!
This is where my patented magnetic bomb-attractor vest can aid us, that Beaker is conveniently wearing.
What?
What's going on?
Wait!
Miss Piggy's ring is the bomb!
Some of you guys grab Piggy, and some of you guys grab me.
Pull!
That's only 800 years old.
Nicely done, Beaker!
Kermit!
Help!
- Piggy!
- Help!
She's on the roof!
Shut up and keep moving, pig!
You are my insurance policy!
Number Two, you look ridiculous.
Why are you wearing that?
Because I am the Lemur.
And the world's new number one criminal.
That's right.
This is where I double-cross you.
First rule of double-cross.
You don't announce the double-cross before you double-cross.
It's not even a rule because it is so obvious.
The Lemur is literally the worst bad guy name I have ever heard!
Let's go!
Oh, no!
He's getting away!
What are we gonna do?
I'm gonna stop that helicopter.
We're coming!
Hang on, Miss Piggy!
Jump!
Shut up, pig!
Kermit!
We have to do something!
'I got it!
There's only one way we can reach him up there!
Muppet Ladder!
- What the...
- Kermit!
Come on up, Chef!
Watch the hair, bear.
Give up, Constantine.
I've got you now!
Bad move, frog.
Kermit!
Okay, Kermit, we're coming to get you.
Now!
No, something's wrong.
We're not moving.
You're ruining my getaway!
Hang on, Piggy!
I'm coming!
Go get 'em, Kermit!
Kermie!
Welcome aboard, Kermit.
You don't know who you're dealing with.
I am the world's most dangerous frog.
Oh, brother!
You may be the world's most dangerous frog, but you're still a frog!
No one tricks me into marrying them and then hurts my Kermie!
What a woman!
Yeah.
My woman.
And I believe this belongs to you.
Well, I'm sorry I ruined your wedding.
Oh, Kermie.
I'm so glad you did.
Okay.
Can we get down now?
We did it, guys!
What an action sequence!
You sure look pretty, Miss Piggy.
Thank you.
Congratulations, weirdos, you've saved the Crown Jewels!
And you've caught my nemesis, the Lemur.
Look at his little costume.
That's adorable!
- I'm not adorable.
- He is adorable.
You're adorable!
Did you make that kitty-cat outfit?
The bad guy is Dominic Badguy!
Well, mon ami, I guess this is where we say goodbye.
You go your way, and I go mine.
Here comes the rain.
Oh, boy.
And I said I wasn't going to do this.
Pull yourself together, man.
Stop crying.
We're only saying our final farewell.
Goodbye forever!
I'm going to miss you so much!
I'm going to miss you, my French friend.
Whenever you're ready.
- Yes.
- Yes, of course.
- Take them away!
- Take them away!
- Thank you.
- Au revoir, Muppets.
'BYE-bye.
- See you!
You're number two
- Sam.
- Shut up.
Sam!
Wait for me!
You know, I missed all of you so much.
There he is, right there!
Arrest him!
Arrest that frog!
Nadya?
Wait.
For what?
For leading the largest mass break-out in Gulag history.
You will get 30 years.
Maybe 50.
- But"
- No "buts," Kermit.
You didn't finish Gulag Annual Revue, and you didn't even say goodbye.
- What?
- What?
You are coming with me.
Now, move!
Fellas, listen.
Easy.
No, no, no!
Kermit!
Wait!
We're sorry, Kermit.
We're sorry that we didn't notice you were missing.
We're sorry we didn't tell you often enough how much you mean to all of us.
We're sorry we ever took you for granted.
But that's never going to happen again.
Because if Kermit has to go back to the gulag, you'll have to take me, too.
No.
You're my best friend, Kermit.
Wherever you go, I go.
You'll have to take me, too.
And me.
Kermit, we convinced ourselves that evil frog was you because he gave us what we thought we wanted.
When what we really wanted...
What we really needed...
Was you, Kermit.
The actual, real you.
It would appear you were right, Kermit.
I guess this is your family.
And families belong together.
You are free to go.
Forever.
Kermit, did you hear that?
We're free!
Nadya, thank you!
Great!
That's wonderful!
Wait!
Hey, guys, listen.
We still have to finish our world tour.
And I know where we need to play next.
For one night only,
Siberia, Russia!
Yes, yes!
I'll pack my swimsuit right away!
Wonderful!
It's terrible.
You will hate it.
You will hate it.
Okay, guys, this is it.
The Gulag Finale!
Here we go!
A-one, two, three, four!
Together again, again
Gee, it's good to be together again, again
I just can't imagine that you've ever been gone
It's not starting over It's just going on
Together again, again
Now we're here
And there's no need remembering when
Because no feeling feels like that feeling
Together again
Again, again, again!
Together again, again
Gee, it's good to be together again, again
I just can't imagine that you've ever been gone
It's not starting over
It's just going on
Together again, again
Now we're here
And there's no need remembering when
'Cause no feeling feels like that feeling
Together again
Again
I just can't imagine that you've ever been gone
It's not starting over It's just going on
Together again, again
Gee, it's good to be together again, again
'Cause no feeling feels like that feeling
Together a-...
Together again!
Okay, Nadya, this is it.
Your solo.
Kermit!
Oh, boy.
- Hey, pull the rope!
- Oh, right.
This cast is really heavy.
Row", come here.
Come here, come here.
Yeah, what do you got there?
Take this.
You should have negotiated a smaller font size.
I believe I may have something that could help.
This is my automated end-crawl operating machine.
All I have to do is push this button and it will crawl all by itself.
Let's try this.
Another qualified success.
Check this out.
You can go home now, Ma.
The movie is over.
And cut!
- Wow.
That was so amazing!
- Walter, you did a wonderful job.
Thank you, Kermit.
Did we get that?
- We got it.
- We got it, yup.
Movie's over, people.
Go home.
That is a wrap.
Okay, nice work, everyone.
Make sure to fill out your I-9s, and we'll see you on the next one.
So...
What do we do now?
Well, we're together again.
We got the theater and all our fans are back.
Yeah!
Actually, those were extras.
I saw a few tapping their toes.
Yeah, those were paid dancers.
Or...
Maybe since we're all here, now could be the perfect time for you and me to tie the knot, Kermie!
Well, I mean, maybe I could.
Hey, what's the camera still doing here?
Oh, no.
Disaster!
That can only mean one thing.
Doggone it, you're right!
It looks like they've ordered a sequel.
We're doing a sequel
We're back by popular demand
Come on, everybody, strike up the band!
We're doing a sequel
That's what we do in Hollywood
And everybody knows
That the sequel's never quite as good
A sequel Another feature attraction
Places, please Light the lights
Roll camera, "Action!"
I thought it was the end
But no, my friends, this is when
We get to do it all again!
Do it all again
Until the credits roll
We got another go to show them
We can do it all again!
We're doing a sequel There's no need to disguise
The studio considers us a viable franchise
We're doing a sequel The studio wants more
While they wait for Tom Hanks
To make Toy Story 4!
I thought it was the end
But no, my friends, this is when
We get to do it all again!
Do it all again!
Until the credits roll
We've got another go to show them
We can do it all again!
We're doing a sequel
Let's give it a go
With Hollywood stars
And more one-liner cameos
We're doing a sequel
I don't mean to be a stickler
But this is the seventh sequel
To our original motion picture
We're doing a sequel
Let's give it a shot
All we need now is a half-decent plot
Got it.
An epic love story between a very handsome, long-nosed purple thing and a beautiful chicken.
Gonzo with the Wind.
Does anybody have any other ideas?
It's about getting the Muppets back together again to stop an evil oil baron from demolishing the old studio!
Fozzie, did you even watch our last film?
It's about a frog who marries a beautiful, perfect pig.
And they have to kiss each other a lot!
I don't think Americans watch subtitled films.
Kermit, how about the Muppets go on a world tour?
That's perfect!
I thought it was the end
But no, my friends, this is when
We get to do it all again!
Until the credits roll
We've got another go to show them
We can do it all again!
We're doing a sequel
It's more of the same Let's give it a name
How about The Muppets Again?
It's the Muppets again with The Muppets Again
It's the
Muppets
Again!
- Okay?
- I'm okay!
Okay!
Enema-boomed.!
Hey!
Pepperoni!
Come on!
Let's dance.
It's time to light the lights.
Muppet news flash.
Constantine, the world's most dangerous frog, has escaped from a maximum security gulag in Siberia, Russia.
This move has leapfrogged Constantine to the number one most wanted criminal in the world, one place ahead of the mysterious Lemur.
Wow.
Thanks for seeing me at my regular booth, Muppets.
Big fan.
Huge.
Dominic.
International tour manager.
"Dominic Badguy"?
It's pronounced "Bad-gee." It's French.
It means "good man."
Oh, yes.
Listen up.
You're hot.
You're having a moment.
But what is inevitable about a moment?
it ends.
I don't want this moment to end!
That's why we got to get out there now and capitalize on this moment with a capital yeah?
I want you to conquer the world.
Do an international tour.
Show a global audience what you can do.
Yeah, that sounds great but I'm just not sure...
Wait a second, guys, listen.
I'd love to do that, too.
But we've barely gotten back together.
We don't want to mess that up.
Okay, I am inundated with offers of management at the moment.
One Direction, U2, Cirque du Soleil.
Just some of the acts I can list.
Wow, that's a good list!
And now, I wanna tour manage you guys.
I know you're the boss, Kermit.
I wouldn't interfere with that.
We would share our managerial roles because you've got a special bond with these little guys.
Sure.
President Clinton?
What?
I'm on my way, Number Two.
Great, they're taking the bait.
- Well, he seems like a nice guy.
- Yeah.
Humble and honest.
I just...
I think we have to get settled first, you know?
Hone the show, get some new material, and then maybe go on a world tour.
See you in Berlin.
Yes.
Auf Wiedersehen,
Number Two.
So...
What's it gonna be, Muppets?
Ready to be world famous?
No pressure, but I am a very busy man.
That's Rihanna.
I really should take this.
World tour!
World tour!
Well, I mean...
I guess we could always hone our acts on the road, and that would be okay.
Wouldn't it, Kermit?
World tour!
World tour!
Come on, froggy!
Okay, let's do it.
Dominic, you're hired.
Thanks, Kermit.
I mean, boss.
You won't regret this.
Is everybody here?
Yeah?
Okay, guys, guys.
Get them up and move them out.
All aboard, Dominic.
I didn't know there was still third class.
Third class?
How about no class?
Watch the heels!
Piggy.
Why do you need so much luggage?
For our honeymoon, of course!
For our what?
Let's go, guys!
That must be reverse.
Oh, well.
This way looks good, too.
Okay, Dominic, I thought we could start our world tour in London.
Or how about the world capital of comedy?
Berlin, Germany.
Germany!
Was that supposed to happen?
You guys are gonna love this place.
Okay, here we are, guys.
The Hole in the Wall Club!
"Die
Looks like they put the reviews up early.
Yeah, or is that the suggestion box?
"Hole in the Wall Club"?
More like "Hole in the Ground Club."
Okay, everybody.
So, we'll start at the bottom and work our way up.
I've booked us into cabaret bars and coffee houses all across the industrial cities of Northern Germany.
Dusseldorf, Hamburg, Mudburg, Vomitdorf.
Poopenburgen?
Fozzie, we have a solid week booked in Poopenburgen.
This looks great.
And I think we should commend Kermit on his efforts.
Thank you, Dominic.
Thanks.
Or, if I might be so bold, maybe we could consider another venue.
Another venue?
To be precise, this other venue.
Look at that theater!
What?
No, no.
We don't have the money to rent the Berlin National Theatre!
We'll make our money back when we sell it out.
Kermie, I've always dreamed of playing the Berlin National Theatre.
"Ich bin ein Berliner."
More like, "Ein frankfurter"!
Watch it, buster.
Guys, I'm not sure we can do this, you know?
Okay, let's put this to the vote.
All those in favor of believing in ourselves, raise your hands.
That's not what I'm saying.
And all those in favor of just giving up.
I can't believe I'm voting for giving up.
Good.
Well, I'm glad we made this decision.
Wonderful!
So cool!
Isn't that exciting.
I can't believe it.
All right, gather round, troops.
Everybody?
Okay, 9W5-
Since we're playing such a big theater, let's stick with what we know.
We'll open with a cabaret number...
Kermit, when do I do the indoor running of the bulls?
Mr. Kermit, sir?
I would very much like to demonstrate my magnetic bomb-attractor vest.
Bunsen, why would you even invent one of those?
Why did I invent the unexpectedly exploding cupcake?
Hey, what about Muppet Ladder?
Muppet Ladder?
That's never, ever worked, Gonzo.
Last time we all tried that was 20 years ago and you ended up in a cast for six months.
Yeah, good times.
Kermit, what if I do four or five Celine Dion songs?
You know Celine Dion, she works in Vegas.
No, Piggy, there's no time for that.
What about the band's marathon jam session?
Drum solo!
Drum solo!
No drum solo!
Guys, guys, guys!
We can't just do whatever we want.
This is our opening night.
Let's play to our strengths, because...
Well...
Look, I didn't want to worry you guys but if we don't sell this theater out, it would mean the end of the tour.
What?
And maybe the end of us.
Great news, Muppets.
We're sold out.
What?
Fine.
I mean, great, great.
Well done, Dominic.
Hey, I have an amazing idea for an act.
It's called "The Indoor Running of the Bulls."
Gonzo, I've told you, that act is far too dangerous.
Actually, Kermit, I was asking Dominic what he thinks.
Good grief.
Dominic, Dominic!
Five songs.
"Sold out." Like we've sold out a show in 30 years.
Is this a good time to discuss our upcoming European wedding?
No, actually, I'm kind of busy right now.
Perfect!
I have 23 swatches for the seat covers for the reception, eight font choices for the menu, which, by the way, we are not serving flies.
Piggy, what are you talking about?
I'm just trying to involve you in some of the decision-making, dear.
What about being involved in the decision to get married in the first place, huh?
Kermit, you never let me do what I want!
0h. yeah?
Well, what about what I want?
What about that?
I haven't even proposed yet.
- You can do that on our honeymoon.
- What?
That's insane!
Do you hear what you're saying?
Insane?
How dare you call your fiancée insane?
You are not my fiancée!
We are not engaged!
And, as a matter of fact, the way this particular conversation is going right now...
Well...
I'm fine with that!
Piggy.
Wait!
I'm sorry!
Get out!
Don't take it personally.
They still love you.
They just prefer me now.
Thank you, Dominic.
That's very comforting.
Do you know what I think helps sometimes in situations like this?
What?
A walk alone in the fog in former East Berlin.
Maybe along a deserted canal.
Well, I guess a quiet stroll is not a bad idea.
Let the others know I've gone, will you?
Sure.
I promise.
Thanks.
Corrine, come here!
Boo.
What just happened?
What?
Wait a second.
Hold on, hold on!
There must be some mistake!
Don't you know me?
I'm Kermit the Frog!
Silence, Constantine.
The game is up.
Who?
No, no!
Wait a minute!
I'm Kermit the Frog!
Guys, this is a mistake!
I'm telling you!
Hey, hey!
Hello!
Somebody!
Open up!
I'm an Amphibian-American!
It's not easy being mean.
Has anyone seen Kermit?
It's 15 minutes to curtain.
Hi, guys.
Look, it's Kermit, just back from his afternoon stroll.
Hi-lo!
I am Kermit.
What...
He's got a cold.
That's why his voice sounds a little bit different at the moment.
See?
Just calm down.
Just relax.
You are right.
Dominic is terrific!
From now on, let's do whatever he says.
All right.
Yeah.
Wow, that walk must have really helped.
Miss Pig, I have wronged you.
I humbly beg your forgiveness.
You're not getting off that easy, bucko.
Come on, Foo Foo.
Bad frog!
Bad frog!
What is this?
Let go, dog!
Animal, stop it!
Kermit has agreed that Dominic is right all the time, man.
Good.
So, now that Kermit agrees with me on everything...
- I am Kermit.
- Definitely.
Let's go and hang out backstage, yeah?
Okay, all right.
Come, little friend.
Let us get on with the show and enjoy our family-style adventure during which we shall bond and learn heartwarming lesson.
Perhaps about sharing, or waiting your turn, or the number three.
Right, Kermit.
Sure.
Flawlessly executed.
Bravo.
What did you expect from world's most dangerous frog and number one criminal, Number Two?
Yeah, I know.
You're number one, I'm number two.
I think you mentioned that before.
Now that we control the Muppet tour, Number Two, phase one of our plan is complete.
We are now positioned to carry out greatest...
-"Burglary."
- Yes.
...of all time, and pin it on those gullible Muppets, who will spend the rest of their miserable lives behind bars.
Tonight, we steal the painting and then we'll have all we need to steal the unstealable, the Crown Jewels of England.
Ensuring that my name goes down in history as greatest thief of all time!
You mean our names, right?
Of course.
My name first, then spacebar, spacebar, spacebar, your name.
Sure.
I'm number one You're number two
We're criminals at large But I'm at larger than you
I'm number one
You're number two
I believe in equality
As long as you get less than me
- I'm one
-You're one
You're number two
I'm number two.
You may think that you're smarter
But I'm smarterer than you
I'm number one You're number two
You're lucky to be number two
Not number three
I can see by the look in your eye
You want to get a bigger piece of the pie
One day you'll get your chance
But in the meantime
You've got to dance, monkey, dance!
Really?
I hate dancing.
DO it!
Dance, monkey, dance!
I'm number two He's number one
I can't believe I'm working for an amphibian
I'm number two He's number one
I'm number one!
You know life's gone to the dogs
When your boss is a frog
I can see it's just a matter of time
Before he's gone
And I'm at the front of the line
It won't be long till I get my chance
But in the meantime
I've got to dance, monkey, dance
Dance, monkey, dance
Now, watch me.
- I'm number one
-He's number one
- You're number two
-I'm number two
That's it, kid There you go
Now step aside This ain't your show
- I'm one -"I'm one"
I'm number one
Yes, we know
- I'm...
-He's...
Number one!
That's how it's done.
15 seconds to curtain...
Kermit?
Sure.
Okay.
Have you studied your Kermit tapes yet?
Of course not.
This is child's play for frog of my talent.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome...
"Study Kermit tapes." Nonsense.
It's...
Oh, no.
Kermit!
Introduce the show.
It's the Muppet Show!
With our very special guest star, Christoph Waltz!
What is happening?
Why am I flying?
- What the...
- We gotta do something!
Please welcome our first act,
Herr Christoph Waltz dances the waltz!
Darling, you set my world on fire.
Did somebody say "explosion"?
No!
He says I set his world on fire.
There it is again!
Wait for me!
Please!
Wait for me.
One more!
Keep Waltzing, Mr. Waltz!
Hey!
It was vertigo.
Not stage fright, if that's what you're thinking, Number Two.
Sure.
Right, now to cover our tracks.
Let's get out of here!
CIA.
Interpol!
What is the CIA doing here?
This is my jurisdiction.
Not to mention, my badge is bigger.
One of the stolen paintings was on loan from the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art.
So, this is CIA jurisdiction.
Also, this is my travel badge.
Here's my real badge.
You must have been looking at the wrong...
- Badge!
- What?
You've won this round, Pierre.
- My name is "Jean."
- Okay, Shawn.
It looks like we're gonna be working together.
But that doesn't mean I have to like you.
I didn't like you first.
I didn't like you before I met you.
So, what have we got?
Two priceless paintings stolen and one average painting of an obscure English colonel.
This has all the markings of the work of the Lemur.
What's a lemur?
Only the second most wanted criminal in the world.
And my personal nemesis.
Unfortunately for me, his identity is a mystery.
No, literally, what is a lemur?
It is also a rat-monkey from Madagascar.
Just as I suspected.
This coin is his calling card.
The Lemur, he is playing with us.
I have a delivery here for Mr. Eagle.
Right here.
And here's your rope.
You were saying?
Look at that.
"Muppets sell out in Berlin." Five stars!
Kermit the Frog is liking this news.
Choc-choc, yeah!
Tunnel.
It's not there.
You were wrong!
Not so fast.
Oldest trick in the book.
Write it in lemon juice, then simply apply heat to reveal Colonel Blood's map.
Of course, today, the Crown Jewels lie behind the most sophisticated security system on the planet.
And this map, along with Blood's key and locket, is the only way to get close to them.
Good work, Number Two.
What does it say about location of Blood's key?
Right.
Something, something.
"Finest wooden teeth."
That is not helpful.
Wait.
There's the name of a city here.
Madrid.
You've got the wrong frog!
Hey, hey, hey!
It's Constantine.
- What?
- He's back.
What are you doing?
I'm not Constantine.
My name is Kermit.
Constantine, always with the jokes!
Good old Constantine.
Always trying to pull a fast one.
Old friend.
Since you are back,
I guess you are in charge of prison again.
Here, take prison crown.
We have to readjust it again.
Sergei, you get on that.
Take, take.
Thank you.
Wait a minute.
I've known Constantine for years.
And he has never...
Even"
Said, "Thank you."
Because I am not Constantine.
- How dare you?
- He's not Constantine!
Let's throw him in the recycling compacter!
Yeah!
Throw him in the compacter!
But I'm already green!
Squash that frog!
Put the frog down.
Or I will deploy.
Where am I?
The Gulag.
A gulag?
Gulag.
The Big House.
The Big House!
Hit it, boys.
This is Russia's premier state-funded hotel

Listen, I'm telling you, you've got the wrong frog!
If you are not Constantine, why do you have that mole?
It's not real.
Someone glued it to my lip.
As far as authorities are concerned, you are Constantine.
Glue or no glue.
Make yourself comfortable.
You're going to be here a while.
I wouldn't be so sure.
My friends will be here soon!
Now, lights out!
Turn them back on!
I can't see anything.
You have to wait until I'm, like, out of the hallway.
It's figure of speech.
Okay.
It seems that Blood's key is hidden in a marble bust of his accomplice, Godfrey the Unknown, which is kept in the Statue Room at the Prado Museum.
Perfect.
We break in, steal the bust, destroy it and grab key.
Yeah, it's not that simple.
You see, no one knows what Godfrey the Unknown looked like.
Of course not.
He was second in command, so no one cared.
And there's 250 statues in that room.
That may be problem.
Let me think, Number Two.
Excusez-moi, Kermie.
Do you have a moment?
Kermit.
I just wanted to say that I accept your apology and I'm ready to put our little disagreement or whatever it was, behind us.
And, perhaps, I was a little too eager about our wedding...
Pig, I have question.
Am I wearing sign that says "Bother Me"?
What was that?
What was that?
I was in the middle of evilly plotting.
I do not like to be interrupted while evilly plotting.
If we're to get away with this, you've got to keep up appearances.
I am keeping up appearances.
If you want the Crown Jewels, stick to the plan.
Do whatever the pig wants.
Keep her happy.
Whatever she asks of you.
Stupid frog!
Stupid train!
I don't want to talk to you, Kermit.
I said, I want you out!
I don't think you know what you want.
Yeah, I do.
I just told you, I...
You're my lady and I'm your man, baby.
And that's why, if you stick with me,
I can give you what you want.
Baby, stop right there
Let me clear the air
Baby, look into these eyes Let me apologize
I know what you're thinking of
You're thinking, "Where's the love?"
Babe, the love ain't gone It's here where it belongs
I know what you're waiting for
Well, you don't need to wait no more
I can give you anything you want
Give you anything you need
I'll make your dreams come true
Give you anything you want
Fulfill your fantasies
I'll make your dreams come true

-Cockatoo
- Kangaroo
-Kangaroo
In Malibu
I'll make your dreams come true
Kermie.
You are what I've always wanted.
Excuse us.
But we are all wondering, what's the set list for tomorrow, chief?
I don't care.
Do whatever you want.
What?
Is he serious?
Kermit, could I do indoor running of the bulls?
Sure, Zongo.
Who cares?
Wow!
Thank you, Kermit!
Kermie, if he can do his thing, why can't I sing my five songs?
Well...
You can.
Who cares?
We don't have time for all this stuff.
We're up to a three-hour show, Kermit.
You are forgetting one thing, small man with glasses.
I can give you what you want.
All right!
Okay.
Indoor running the bulls.
Won't the show be terrible?
Guys?
I'm so confused.
Where are you guys?
Looks like I'm gonna have to break out of here myself.
It's The Muppet Show, with our very special guest star, Lynn Redgrave.
Yes!
Hi-ho!
Kermit the Frog, here.
Hi-lo.
Kermit the Frog here.
The lovers, the dreamers and me
The lovers, the dreamers and cheese
Nailed it.
It's El Muppet Show, with our very special guest, Salma Hayek.
Hey!
- Would you look at that?
- No.
Good idea.
Yes!
Hello and welcome to El Muppet Show.
Please welcome our opening act, the Great Gonzo and the indoor running of the bulls!
Gonzo?
Gonzo, I don't want to do this.
What?
This is gonna be great.
Are you sure about this?
Nope.
Come on.
Let's go.
- Where have you been?
- On stage.
Why did the...
The bulls are out of control!
Who could have foreseen this?
Me.
I did.
Here they come again!
Okay.
Sorry about that, folks, but now put your hands together for Miss Piggy.
I don't believe it.
They've managed the impossible.
What an achievement!
Bravo!
Bravo!
What?
You mean you actually like this show now?
No!
They've made the show even worse!
- Bravo!
Bravo!
- Amazing!
Where is it?
It's got to be here somewhere.
Keep smashing, Number Two.
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm smashing.
Where is that key?
The last one. it better be in here.
He looks a little bit like you, Number Two.
Colonel Blood's key.
Nice of him to label it.
- So, where is the locket?
- There's more.
Of course.
That's where Blood's locket is.
In the vaults of the Irish National Bank.
Then I know where Muppet tour must stop next.
Dublin.
Drum solo!
A standing ovation?
I am Kermit.
I hope you enjoyed my show.
I love you, Madrid!
Wow, what an audience!
Great show, Kermit!
They loved me, Kermie!
They loved me!
Guys?
I'm not sure that was such a great show.
Like, what are you talking about?
That jam was, like, totally epic.
Exactly.
And I'm glad to say the Spanish reviewers disagree with you as well, Walter.
They loved us.
Five out of five jamón serranos.
Those reviews really came out fast.
And Citizen Kane only got four jamón serranos.
And more good news.
Pack up, everyone.
I've booked our next gig.
In Dublin.
Oh, great!
Now we all have time to rehearse.
Rehearse?
Let's celebrate.
Yeah!
Yes!
You deserve it, comrades!
Go do whatever you want.
Looks like we are busted.
Exactly what are we doing today?
I am doing my job.
All we need to do is look at the map with the blinky lights, and wait.
This is how it is done here in Europe.
In America, we use 3-D satellite LED displays.
Not cardboard with Christmas lights stuck through it.
A blinky light!
She is blinking!
Let's go.
What is this?
A toy?
This is my car, Le Maximum.
It is illegal now in most of the EU for its massive size.
It's so needlessly spacious, I feel guilty.
I hate Europe.
Madrid, here we come!
- Get out of the way.
- Stay on the road!
Interpol!
Watch out, everyone!
37 hours.
Not bad.
The Lemur.
I knew it.
This doesn't make any sense.
Why break in, smash some priceless busts and then not steal anything?
There must be something bigger going on.
But what?
I've got it!
Sorry. 2:00 PM.
My day is over.
Wait.
Those weirdos, the Muppets, were performing next to the crime scene in Berlin.
And here they are, performing right next to the crime scene in Madrid!
You know what that means.
- Yes, they love museums!
- No!
They're suspects!
Okay.
Overtime.
We must find these Muppets before they flee the country.
To the train station!
Hey, Larry, want a bite of my bocadillos?
What the...
Are you all Les Muppets?
Wow, those are big badges!
Thank you.
Come, come.
You must come with us to answer some questions.
Kermit, let's begin Describe the day you played Berlin
We rehearsed, and then we walked about
We ate bratwurst and sauerkraut
That night at 10:03
Were you inside the portrait gallery?
My alibi is watertight
The audience saw me sing all night
Monsieur, we know you did the crime
I was on stage that whole time
Ask who sang Rainbow Connection
Thank you, Kermit, no more questions
I think it's time for good cop/romantic cop.
Miss Piggy, you could end up locked inside
And now's your chance to save your hide
Gentlemen, I did not know
It's a crime to steal the show
Tell us how the art was taken
If you want to save your bacon
I haven't seen your missing art
All I've stolen is audience hearts
We'll catch the swine
That did this job
Give up the pig puns, creep!
Go jump in a lake, that's my suggestion
Thank you, Piggy, no more questions
I think she likes me.
Huh?
I don't think your puns are helping the investigation.
- You know, I think they did it
-No, they didn't
Yes, they did and we can pin it
If they did how did they do it?
If they didn't how did they didn't?
If they didn't then it's easy 'cause they simply didn't do it
If they did it, then I knew it but we've nothing that can prove it
Excuse me.
Let's go from the start
What do you know about the stolen art?
I didn't know there was a plan
Your accusation's far out, man
The chances of us committing a crime are less than .009
I can do an Elvis impression
Thank you, Muppets No more questions
- They didn't
-No, they didn't
There's no way they did the crime
- They couldn't, they're too stupid
-Not criminal masterminds
We do not know who did it But we know who didn't do it
So we know who didn't do it
Yes, we know who didn't do it
They're incapable of being culpable!
Hi!
Come on.
Let's go over the files again.
Stop digging escape tunnel, frog.
How did you know?
It's the first escape everyone tries.
That's the second escape people try.
Oh, boy.
Third way!
Give up, frog.
I have Netflix account with search keywords "prison escape."
I have seen every prison movie ever made.
Even the ones in space.
Yeah, well...
Hey, wait a second.
That's them!
That's my friends!
What happened to them?
"Dominic Badguy.
"An interview with the brains behind
"the Muppets' triumphant comeback world tour."
What?
It seems your friends do not need you anymore.
They have forgotten about you.
No,no,no.
They wouldn't.
They couldn't.
We're a family.
"Family"?
No one believes in family in the Gulag, frog.
People are only ever out for themselves.
Listen, Kermit.
We have annual lighthearted Gulag Revue coming up.
It is that, or they riot.
I thought you might help me.
The thing is, Nadya,
I'm sort of done doing that, but thanks for the offer.
This is not offer.
This is prison.
You are going to help me.
Rehearsals tomorrow, 4:00 AM.
Or I put you on The Wall.
"The Wall"?
Why would I be afraid of a wall?
Just direct the show.
You'll never escape.
What time did you say that rehearsal was?
Okay.
What about this comedian bear?
He is too stupid to be stupid.
He must be some sort of genius.
Maybe your "Lemur" hunch is correct.
Except for the fact that Les Muppets play tomorrow night at the Dublin Theatre.
Which just happens to be next door to the Irish National Bank!
Maybe your Muppet hunch is...
Correct.
It's almost as if we're...
Not so different after
all.
Come, come, mon ami!
We must follow Les Muppets to Dublin!
To Dublin!
Kremlin!
Putin!
No, what are you doing?
- Okay, number five, baby.
Blow.
- Come on.
- There you go.
You know the routine.
- Come on, Diddy Daddy!
Hey. guys?
Fellas?
Whoa, man!
Hey, did you see that?
Do you guys think that Kermit's been acting a little weird lately?
No.
You're probably right.
It's just me.
Bad frog.
Enough!
You're all terrible.
Fix this.
Or it's The Wall.
Of course.
Guys...
It's always good to start with an up-tempo song and dance and then go into a comedy routine.
But we like Boyz ll Men!
It is Big Papa's favorite song.
Lot of emotions in that song for him.
I'm not learning no other song.
I'm a triple threat!
A singer, a dancer and a murderer!
There you go.
How do you like that?
Drum solo!
Drum solo!
When do I do the indoor running of the bulls?
What about the band's marathon jam session?
Four or five musical numbers.
Quiet!
Now, look!
We are holding auditions tomorrow.
And if any of you have a problem with that, any of you, then my door is always open!
Thank you, Kermit.
This is what we've all been waiting to hear.
Teach us, Kermit.
We will do whatever frog say.
Put it there.
Good night, frog.
Nice work today.
Thanks, Nadya.
Even if your friends don't need you, we certainly do.
Good night.
- Good night, Big Papa.
-'Night, Nadya.
- Good night, Carl.
- Good night, Nadya.
- Good night, Prison King.
- Good night, Nadya.
- Good night, Skullcrusher.
- Good night.
- Good night, Danny Trejo.
- Good night, Nadya.
No one believes in family in the Gulag, frog.
People are only ever out for themselves.
Well, well, well.
What's he up to?
Gentlemen.
I need this review to go into Friday's paper.
Super positive.
Five stars.
I won't be paid off for a review.
I'm a journalist.
I'm joking, of course.
Cash or credit?
- What was that?
- Rats.
Who cares?
Hand these tickets out to anyone who will take one.
In fact, you may have to actually pay people to come.
It's the Muppets.
It's not gonna be easy.
And I want a standing ovation.
Oh, dear.
Where does he keep all those suitcases?
Let's see here.
What's Kermit doing on the cover of this newspaper?
Dominic's the bad guy!
Dominic's the bad guy!
Fozzie!
Dominic's the reason we've been selling out our shows!
He's been giving away tickets and bribing journalists to write great reviews!
Why didn't we ever think of doing that?
I mean, that's terrible!
The question is, why?
And could it have anything to do with why Kermit's been acting so weird lately?
Hey, wanna see something funny?
Yes, Constantine, the world's most dangerous frog.
Fozzie, what does he have to do with what I just told you?
Nothing, but check this out.
Look, it's Kermit.
What did you do with Kermit?
Wait a minute.
Fozzie...
What if Kermit has been replaced by this Constantine guy?
Nah, that's impossible.
We'd all notice!
Wouldn't we?
Kermit?
Are you there?
Hello?
Kermit?
Everything's fine.
Let's get out of here.
Wait!
We should look around.
Kermit's got a big bomb collection.
Looks like he's planning some sort of comedy heist bit.
I hope not.
Those never work.
What's that?
Oh, no.
What, what, What?
What?
Oh, no.
- We got to get out of here!
- Yeah!
Not so fast.
Where's Kermit?
What do you want?
You have wocka-ed your last wocka, bear.
- Bad frog!
- Animal!
- Oh, good boy!
- Great job!
Thank you.
Quick!
The freight train!
Go, go, go!
We got to go back!
Warn the others!
I tried.
They didn't believe me.
It's our word against his and, well, he's fooled them all.
Should we go to the police?
We don't have any evidence!
I feel terrible.
I'm the one who talked Kermit into doing this tour in the first place.
I wish Kermit was here!
He would know what to do.
You're right.
There's only one guy in this world who can save us.
Only one frog who can restore order, bring justice, and set things right!
You are talking about Kermit, right?
Yes, Fozzie.
Kermit.
Good!
Great!
That's it, guys, that's it!
That's good, guys!
Come on!
And hit it hard!
Okay.
All right.
Yes.
Nadya?
I think perhaps we should, perhaps, keep it prisoners only.
Of course.
I just love Broadway.
But you are right, Kermit, as ever.
Okay.
Thank you.
Okay, fellas, listen up.
Here's who made the cut.
Sergei!
King!
That's you.
You are always right, my beautiful amphibian prince.
I will never let you go.
This is better.
What's wrong?
You only ever knit when you're stressed.
The bear, the little guy and their dog, they are onto us.
They got away-
How are we gonna spin this?
Comrades, I'm afraid I have bad news.
Walter and Fonzie have quit the Muppets.
Wait.
You can quit the Muppets?
Wait a second.
Walter quit the Muppets?
We just did a whole movie where he joined the Muppets.
Yeah, we sure spent a lot of time on it.
I'll say.
Maybe even at the expense of other long-standing, beloved Muppets.
Come on, Robin.
Coming.
Well, as the old saying goes...
The show must continue,
-in a timely fashion.
- Wait.
Fozzie and Walter are part of our family.
We can't let them go without a fight.
Right, Kermit?
I know this is hard, Gonzo.
Walter and Fonzie were my best friends.
Kermit...
Are you sure you're okay?
Yes, I'm fine, pig.
I could never lose you.
You complete me.
Kermie.
Guys, come on!
This is gonna be fantastic.
We should be celebrating!
Yes.
Remember, I can give you what you want.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, right.
- I'll keep that in mind.
- Say, has anyone seen Animal?
Does anybody else feel like we're traveling in circles?
There it is!
Finally!
Do you have evidence to frame the bear?
Excellent.
Where are the guards?
Stay here.
I'm going to check on the vault.
Stop it!
Colonel Blood's locket.
Of course.
Now grab it.
Shawn.
Someone's coming.
Abort!
I think I just saw something.
It's headed back towards the theater!
- That was close.
- Too close.
We need to move to final phase three. "Wedding."
Hey, Kermit, you can't go out there.
It's Piggy's Celine Dion number.
Did you see anything?
Not a thing.
It is my lunch hour.
It lasts six hours.
Excuse me.
Ladies and gentlemen!
I have an announcement!
What?
Kermit,
I'm in the middle of a song here!
Miss Piggy.
I have very important question for you.
Yeah?
What are you doing?
Do you wish to become Mrs. Piggy?
Or rather, Mrs. The Frog?
Kermie, I thought you'd never ask.
I really thought you'd never ask!
So?
What do you say?
It's beautiful.
Yes!
Yes!
Of course!
Yes!
I can't believe this!
After all this time, it was finally just so easy!
That's right, folks, it's the Muppet wedding the world has been waiting for.
We're putting our tour on hold...
What?
...to be married in two days' time at the world's most romantic location, the Tower of London.
Here's a Muppet newsflash.
The years of waiting are over.
The biggest "Will they, won't they?" of all times has been answered with a firm, "They will."
Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy are to be married!
That's right, folks.
They're finally tying the knot.
Well, at least they didn't get the pot of gold.
No, they did not.
I have never been to a more ridiculous crime scene.
The comedian bear, he was here.
The Lemur.
He, too, was here.
Could the comedian bear and the Lemur be one and the same?
The comedian bear is the Lemur.
That is brilliant.
But why would he steal a bunch of old bones?
The bones apparently belonged to one Colonel Thomas Blood.
He was the only man to ever nearly steal the Crown Jewels of England.
Wait!
Where did the frog say he was getting married?
The Tower of London.
The comedian bear is planning on stealing...
- The Tower of London!
- The Crown Jewels!
The Crown Jewels.
Sir, where would you like the flowers?
Who cares?
Hey, chief.
Hi-lo.
We've all been thinking, and...
Well, after you and Miss Piggy get married, what's gonna happen to the tour?
And to us?
Well, now you guys have all the freedom you want.
You don't need me.
I'm done with Muppets.
But, hey, it's been a good run, right?
Good luck.
Kermit!
Did he just say what I thought he said?
What are we gonna do without Kermit?
The only thing we can do.
Pack up, go to the wedding, and head back home.
Foo Foo, it's always been a fight.
But this is so easy, it just doesn't feel right.
This is my dream come true
The day has come for us to say "I do"
There's nowhere else I'd rather be
Nothing in the world means more to me than you
I've waited so patiently
I knew you were the only frog for me
Always knew this day would come
It's written in the stars It's destiny
So how can something so right
Feel so wrong tonight?
After all we've been through
Why do I feel I don't know you?
We'll settle down and start a family
Have a mini you and a mini me
A little pink frog and a little green piggy
They'll learn to say hello and say goodbye
We'll grow gray and old
And live the quiet life
Just you and I
Hand in hand we'll stay together
Hey.
Look at that sky.
Forever and ever
So how can something so right
Feel so wrong tonight?
After all we've been through
Why do I feel I don't know you?
How can something so right feel so wrong inside?
How can something so good leave me feeling so bad?
How can my dreams coming true
Leave me lonely and blue?
How come the happiest day of my life is so sad?
How can I feel the high when I feel so low?
After all we've been through After coming so far
Is this my destiny?
Where is the love that's written
In the stars?
How can something so right
Feel so wrong tonight?
After all we've been through
Why do I feel I don't
Know you?
Oh, Kermie.
- Hey, the show's starting.
- Yeah!
Lady and gentlemen, good evening and welcome to the Gulag Annual Revue Show!
Escapo, you're up after the ballet.
Okay.
Kermit!
Kermit!
Kermit.
Fozzie.
Walter.
Animal.
We're here to rescue you.
Yes!
And we've got to go right now!
Yeah!
Hey!
I can't believe you're here.
It's so good to see you guys!
Kermit, listen.
An evil frog named Constantine has taken over the Muppets and replaced you!
What?
Constantine replaced me?
Yeah.
And he was working together with Dominic.
They're planning something terrible, but we don't know what.
But...
How could you not have noticed that he'd replaced me, Fozzie?
He looked like you and he talked like you.
Okay, he didn't talk that much like you, come to think of it.
But he said he had a cold.
Animal know.
"Animal know"?
You mean, all this time, I've been locked in a Russian gulag, no one, not one single person from the Muppets except Animal noticed I'd been replaced by an evil criminal mastermind?
It sounds worse than it was.
No.
It's as bad as it sounds.
I thought you guys had forgotten about me.
That you didn't need me anymore.
We'd never forget about you.
We need you more than ever, Kermit.
Good frog.
Late extra!
Late extra!
Read all about it!
Kermit and Miss Piggy to be married in London!
What?
Piggy?
Piggy's gonna marry the world's most dangerous frog tomorrow?
Piggy and the gang are in danger!
To London!
No.
Kermit!
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
I'm in a gulag.
Sorry about that, Ivan!
It's okay!
No problem, Kermit.
It's easy mistake.
Right.
Thanks for not shooting me!
Sure.
No problem...
Hey, nothing personal.
We have to escape, guys.
Tonight!
But how?
Kermit.
Do you know where these prop pickaxes and shovels are supposed to go for this big mining number?
Wait!
I've got it!
And now, folks, the Great Escapo!
Oh, no, you don't.
Nice try, Escapo.
I sure hope this works, Walter.
I have tried a lot of ways to get out of here.
This is gonna work, Kermit.
I'll see you on the outside.
Okay!
Gosh, I hope this works.
Thank you, thank you, everybody.
And now, we're going underground.
Working in the coal mine!
- Bravo!
Bravo!
- Bravo!
Oh, no.
Kermie!
I can't believe that worked!
We did it!
Great work, guys!
Now put the pedal to the metal.
We have a wedding to crash!
Yeah!
That's a nice venue.
The main entrance is too well-guarded.
I'm gonna need to get in some other way.
Here you go.
You're the new guy?
Yes, I am.
Next time, wear a uniform.
Right.
Wow, Kermit, you were like James Bond back there.
Thanks, Fozzie.
Okay, listen, guys.
Walter, you and Animal go look in the chapel.
Right.
- Fozzie, come with me.
- Yes, sir.
- Good luck, guys.
- You, too, Kermit.
Piggy?
Where is she?
Kermit, these are your clothes.
This tuxedo is too tight.
Someone's coming!
Hide!
Hide!
Which room am I supposed to be in?
Here it is.
I hate weddings.
What the...
There you are.
Well, don't just stand there gawping, Number Two.
Come in.
Let us take this convenient opportunity to review our plans.
Once you've stolen the Crown Jewels and framed the Muppets, ring the tower bell five times and we will rendezvous on the roof.
But what will you do when you're married?
Because the pig will know everything.
Once she's served her purpose, kaboom.
It will be bacon for breakfast.
Champagne fridge delivery.
Put it over there on the bear-skin rug.
Thank you!
It's show time.
Fozzie, are you okay?
Yeah, I think so.
How do I look?
You look fine.
You look fine.
Come on, we have to go rescue Miss Piggy!
Right!
Let's go!
The Lemur!
I have you finally!
And Constantine, the world's most dangerous frog!
No,no,no.
As you might say, case sol-ved!
Perfect!
Time for my annual eight-week paid vacation.
No, wait!
What am I supposed to do with them until the mobile holding unit arrives?
On holiday!
No, you've got the wrong frog.
And stay there!
And so you know, Number Two, I have hired us help.
The world's smallest team of jewel thieves.
Babies, meet your new boss.
Genius, I know!
Who would suspect babies of stealing Crown Jewels?
Look at their sweet faces.
Let's see.
Where am I seated?
I'll need an usher.
Usher?
ls there an usher?
Yes.
I'm the Usher.
Pig or frog?
What do you think?
I don't know, man.
Pig?
No.
Frog.
I'm related through marriage.
What kind of an usher are you?
You're up, little dudes.
GO, go:
Down.
Tip.
Come on!
What the...
Dominic.
Hey, Dominic.
Shut up.
The wedding, it's starting.
She looks beautiful.
Fozzie, we got to do something.
This is so frustrating!
Wow, would you look at that?
Now that's a poorly made car.
Let's get out of here!
I'm just happy for them.
Really happy for them.
- Would you please stop talking?
- Okay.
Dearly beloved...
What!
Code Red!
Code Red!
Oh, come on.
- Not a laser web.
- Pretty.
Right.
Go and get the suspend-y ropey thing.
- And my really cool skintight outfit.
- Yep.
Shawn, come back from vacation!
Constantine and the Lemur have escaped.
The Crown Jewels are in danger!
We are gathered here today to witness the union of this pig and this frog in Holy Matrimony before the presence of God.
Do you, Kermit the Frog, take Miss Piggy to be your lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, so help you God?
Yes.
Yes, I do.
And do you, Miss Piggy, take Kermit the Frog to be your lawfully wedded husband, in sickness and in health, so help you God?
L.-
L.-
Just say "I do."
This is what you've always wanted, right?
I do?
I'm sorry, is that a question?
No, it was not a question.
We have to do something, guys.
Kermit, we've got to get you close to Miss Piggy!
What does this do?
- What the...
- Piggy, it's me, Kermit.
Come on, we have to get out of here!
The wedding is off.
Oh, wow!
Like, I kind of knew he'd get cold flippers.
Excuse us.
No, Kermit!
What are you doing?
- Piggy, I will explain later.
- I cannot believe...
Come here, frog!
Where you going?
I'm sorry, my dear, forgive me.
What is going on at my wedding?
- Gotcha!
- What?
Animal, pull!
What is happening here?
Catch froggie!
Catch froggie!
Well, this is the best Muppet wedding ever!
Piggy, listen!
That's not me!
I'm me!
He's Constantine, the world's most dangerous...
Two Kermits?
Well, that explains a lot.
How can there be two Kermits?
Of all the ways to ruin a wedding, this has got to be the most creative.
Two Kermits!
No, just one Kermit.
Me.
No, no, no.
Do not listen to him!
I am the real Kermit.
That's ridiculous!
I am Kermit the Frog!
No, I am Kermit the Frog!
Hi-lo, Kermit the Frog, here.
"Hi-lo?" It's "Hi-ho!"
Would every Kermit be quiet!
Well, there's only one sure way to settle this.
First Kermit.
Will you marry me?
Yes, of course, let's go!
The helicopter is waiting, my love!
And you, the other Kermit...
Will you marry me?
Well, I mean, I...
I would.
I mean, I could.
It's...
That's my Kermit!
That's our frog!
Kissy-kissy!
That is right, Muppets!
I am Constantine, the world's most dangerous frog and number one criminal!
And a thousand times more frog than this Kermit person!
And now,
I have only one thing to say to you fools!
Good night, folks!
What is that?
It's a bomb!
This is where my patented magnetic bomb-attractor vest can aid us, that Beaker is conveniently wearing.
What?
What's going on?
Wait!
Miss Piggy's ring is the bomb!
Some of you guys grab Piggy, and some of you guys grab me.
Pull!
That's only 800 years old.
Nicely done, Beaker!
Kermit!
Help!
- Piggy!
- Help!
She's on the roof!
Shut up and keep moving, pig!
You are my insurance policy!
Number Two, you look ridiculous.
Why are you wearing that?
Because I am the Lemur.
And the world's new number one criminal.
That's right.
This is where I double-cross you.
First rule of double-cross.
You don't announce the double-cross before you double-cross.
It's not even a rule because it is so obvious.
The Lemur is literally the worst bad guy name I have ever heard!
Let's go!
Oh, no!
He's getting away!
What are we gonna do?
I'm gonna stop that helicopter.
We're coming!
Hang on, Miss Piggy!
Jump!
Shut up, pig!
Kermit!
We have to do something!
' I got it!
There's only one way we can reach him up there!
Muppet Ladder!
- What the...
- Kermit!
Come on up, Chef!
Watch the hair, bear.
Give up, Constantine.
I've got you now!
Bad move, frog.
Kermit!
Okay, Kermit, we're coming to get you.
Now!
No, something's wrong.
We're not moving.
You're ruining my getaway!
Hang on, Piggy!
I'm coming!
Go get 'em, Kermit!
Kermie!
Welcome aboard, Kermit.
You don't know who you're dealing with.
I am the world's most dangerous frog.
Oh, brother!
You may be the world's most dangerous frog, but you're still a frog!
No one tricks me into marrying them and then hurts my Kermie!
What a woman!
Yeah.
My woman.
And I believe this belongs to you.
Well, I'm sorry I ruined your wedding.
Oh, Kermie.
I'm so glad you did.
Okay.
Can we get down now?
We did it, guys!
What an action sequence!
You sure look pretty, Miss Piggy.
Thank you.
Congratulations, weirdos, you've saved the Crown Jewels!
And you've caught my nemesis, the Lemur.
Look at his little costume.
That's adorable!
- I'm not adorable.
- He is adorable.
You're adorable!
Did you make that kitty-cat outfit?
The bad guy is Dominic Badguy!
Well, mon ami, I guess this is where we say goodbye.
You go your way, and I go mine.
Here comes the rain.
Oh, boy.
And I said I wasn't going to do this.
Pull yourself together, man.
Stop crying.
We're only saying our final farewell.
Goodbye forever!
I'm going to miss you so much!
I'm going to miss you, my French friend.
Whenever you're ready.
- Yes.
- Yes, of course.
- Take them away!
- Take them away!
- Thank you.
- Au revoir, Muppets.
'BYE-bye.
-see you!
You're number two
- Sam.
- Shut up.
Sam!
Wait for me!
You know, I missed all of you so much.
There he is, right there!
Arrest him!
Arrest that frog!
Nadya?
Wait.
For what?
For leading the largest mass break-out in Gulag history.
You will get 30 years.
Maybe 50.
- But"
- No "buts," Kermit.
You didn't finish Gulag Annual Revue, and you didn't even say goodbye.
- What?
- What?
You are coming with me.
Now, move!
Fellas, listen.
Easy.
No, no, no!
Kermit!
Wait!
We're sorry, Kermit.
We're sorry that we didn't notice you were missing.
We're sorry we didn't tell you often enough how much you mean to all of us.
We're sorry we ever took you for granted.
But that's never going to happen again.
Because if Kermit has to go back to the gulag, you'll have to take me, too.
No.
You're my best friend, Kermit.
Wherever you go, I go.
You'll have to take me, too.
And me.
Kermit, we convinced ourselves that evil frog was you because he gave us what we thought we wanted.
When what we really wanted...
What we really needed...
Was you, Kermit.
The actual, real you.
It would appear you were right, Kermit.
I guess this is your family.
And families belong together.
You are free to go.
Forever.
Kermit, did you hear that?
We're free!
Nadya, thank you!
Great!
That's wonderful!
Wait!
Hey, guys, listen.
We still have to finish our world tour.
And I know where we need to play next.
For one night only,
Siberia, Russia!
Yes, yes!
I'll pack my swimsuit right away!
Wonderful!
It's terrible.
You will hate it.
You will hate it.
Okay, guys, this is it.
The Gulag Finale!
Here we go!
A-one, two, three, four!
Together again, again
Gee, it's good to be together again, again
I just can't imagine that you've ever been gone
It's not starting over It's just going on
Together again, again
Now we're here
And there's no need remembering when
Because no feeling feels like that feeling
Together again
Again, again, again!
Together again, again
Gee, it's good to be together again, again
I just can't imagine that you've ever been gone
It's not starting over
It's just going on
Together again, again
Now we're here
And there's no need remembering when
'Cause no feeling feels like that feeling
Together again
Again
I just can't imagine that you've ever been gone
It's not starting over It's just going on
Together again, again
Gee, it's good to be together again, again
'Cause no feeling feels like that feeling
Together a-...
Together again!
Okay, Nadya, this is it.
Your solo.
Kermit!
Oh, boy.
- Hey, pull the rope!
- Oh, right.
This cast is really heavy.
Row", come here.
Come here, come here.
Yeah, what do you got there?
Take this.
You should have negotiated a smaller font size.
I believe I may have something that could help.
This is my automated end-crawl operating machine.
All I have to do is push this button and it will crawl all by itself.
Let's try this.
Another qualified success.
Check this out.
You can go home now, Ma.
The movie is over.
And cut!
- Wow.
That was so amazing!
- Walter, you did a wonderful job.
Thank you, Kermit.
Did we get that?
- We got it.
- We got it, yup.
Movie's over, people.
Go home.
That is a wrap.
Okay, nice work, everyone.
Make sure to fill out your I-9s, and we'll see you on the next one.
So...
What do we do now?
Well, we're together again.
We got the theater and all our fans are back.
Yeah!
Actually, those were extras.
I saw a few tapping their toes.
Yeah, those were paid dancers.
Or...
Maybe since we're all here, now could be the perfect time for you and me to tie the knot, Kermie!
Well, I mean, maybe I could.
Hey, what's the camera still doing here?
Oh, no.
Disaster!
That can only mean one thing.
Doggone it, you're right!
It looks like they've ordered a sequel.
We're doing a sequel
We're back by popular demand
Come on, everybody, strike up the band!
We're doing a sequel
That's what we do in Hollywood
And everybody knows
That the sequel's never quite as good
A sequel Another feature attraction
Places, please Light the lights
Roll camera, "Action!"
I thought it was the end
But no, my friends, this is when
We get to do it all again!
Do it all again
Until the credits roll
We got another go to show them
We can do it all again!
We're doing a sequel There's no need to disguise
The studio considers us a viable franchise
We're doing a sequel The studio wants more
While they wait for Tom Hanks
To make Toy Story 4!
I thought it was the end
But no, my friends, this is when
We get to do it all again!
Do it all again!
Until the credits roll
We've got another go to show them
We can do it all again!
We're doing a sequel
Let's give it a go
With Hollywood stars
And more one-liner cameos
We're doing a sequel
I don't mean to be a stickler
But this is the seventh sequel
To our original motion picture
We're doing a sequel
Let's give it a shot
All we need now is a half-decent plot
Got it.
An epic love story between a very handsome, long-nosed purple thing and a beautiful chicken.
Gonzo with the Wind.
Does anybody have any other ideas?
It's about getting the Muppets back together again to stop an evil oil baron from demolishing the old studio!
Fozzie, did you even watch our last film?
It's about a frog who marries a beautiful, perfect pig.
And they have to kiss each other a lot!
I don't think Americans watch subtitled films.
Kermit, how about the Muppets go on a world tour?
That's perfect!
I thought it was the end
But no, my friends, this is when
We get to do it all again!
Until the credits roll
We've got another go to show them
We can do it all again!
We're doing a sequel
It's more of the same Let's give it a name
How about The Muppets Again?
It's the Muppets again with The Muppets Again
It's the
Muppets
Again!
- Okay?
- I'm okay!
Okay!
Booma-booma!
Hey!
Pepperoni!
Come on!
Let's dance.
It's time to light the lights.
Muppet news flash.
Constantine, the world's most dangerous frog, has escaped from a maximum security gulag in Siberia, Russia.
This move has leapfrogged Constantine to the number one most wanted criminal in the world, one place ahead of the mysterious Lemur.
Wow.
Thanks for seeing me at my regular booth, Muppets.
Big fan.
Huge.
Dominic.
International tour manager.
"Dominic Badguy"?
It's pronounced "Bad-gee." It's French.
It means "good man."
Oh, yes.
Listen up.
You're hot.
You're having a moment.
But what is inevitable about a moment?
It ends.
I don't want this moment to end!
That's why we got to get out there now and capitalize on this moment with a capital yeah?
I want you to conquer the world.
Do an international tour.
Show a global audience what you can do.
Yeah, that sounds great but I'm just not sure...
Wait a second, guys, listen.
I'd love to do that, too.
But we've barely gotten back together.
We don't want to mess that up.
Okay, I am inundated with offers of management at the moment.
One Direction, U2, Cirque du Soleil.
Just some of the acts I can list.
Wow, that's a good list!
And now, I wanna tour manage you guys.
I know you're the boss, Kermit.
I wouldn't interfere with that.
We would share our managerial roles because you've got a special bond with these little guys.
Sure.
President Clinton?
What?
I'm on my way, Number Two.
Great, they're taking the bait.
- Well, he seems like a nice guy.
- Yeah.
Humble and honest.
I just...
I think we have to get settled first, you know?
Hone the show, get some new material, and then maybe go on a world tour.
See you in Berlin.
Yes.
Auf Wiedersehen,
Number Two.
So...
What's it gonna be, Muppets?
Ready to be world famous?
No pressure, but I am a very busy man.
That's Rihanna.
I really should take this.
World tour!
World tour!
Well, I mean...
I guess we could always hone our acts on the road, and that would be okay.
Wouldn't it, Kermit?
World tour!
World tour!
Come on, froggy!
Okay, let's do it.
Dominic, you're hired.
Thanks, Kermit.
I mean, boss.
You won't regret this.
Is everybody here?
Yeah?
Okay, guys, guys.
Get them up and move them out.
All aboard, Dominic.
I didn't know there was still third class.
Third class?
How about no class?
Watch the heels!
Piggy.
Why do you need so much luggage?
For our honeymoon, of course!
For our what?
Let's go, guys!
That must be reverse.
Oh, well.
This way looks good, too.
Okay, Dominic, I thought we could start our world tour in London.
Or how about the world capital of comedy?
Berlin, Germany.
Germany!
Was that supposed to happen?
You guys are gonna love this place.
Okay, here we are, guys.
The Hole in the Wall Club!
"Die Muppets"?
Looks like they put the reviews up early.
Yeah, or is that the suggestion box?
"Hole in the Wall Club"?
More like "Hole in the Ground Club."
Okay, everybody.
So, we'll start at the bottom and work our way up.
I've booked us into cabaret bars and coffee houses all across the industrial cities of Northern Germany.
Dusseldorf, Hamburg, Mudburg, Vomitdorf.
Poopenburgen?
Fozzie, we have a solid week booked in Poopenburgen.
This looks great.
And I think we should commend Kermit on his efforts.
Thank you, Dominic.
Thanks.
Or, if I might be so bold, maybe we could consider another venue.
Another venue?
To be precise, this other venue.
Look at that theater!
What?
No, no.
We don't have the money to rent the Berlin National Theatre!
We'll make our money back when we sell it out.
Kermie, I've always dreamed of playing the Berlin National Theatre.
"Ich bin ein Berliner."
More like, "Ein frankfurter"!
Watch it, buster.
Guys, I'm not sure we can do this, you know?
Okay, let's put this to the vote.
All those in favor of believing in ourselves, raise your hands.
That's not what I'm saying.
And all those in favor of just giving up.
I can't believe I'm voting for giving up.
Good.
Well, I'm glad we made this decision.
Wonderful!
So cool!
Isn't that exciting.
I can't believe it.
All right, gather round, troops.
Everybody?
Okay, guys.
Since we're playing such a big theater, let's stick with what we know.
We'll open with a cabaret number...
Kermit, when do I do the indoor running of the bulls?
Mr. Kermit, sir?
I would very much like to demonstrate my magnetic bomb-attractor vest.
Bunsen, why would you even invent one of those?
Why did I invent the unexpectedly exploding cupcake?
Hey, what about Muppet Ladder?
Muppet Ladder?
That's never, ever worked, Gonzo.
Last time we all tried that was 20 years ago and you ended up in a cast for six months.
Yeah, good times.
Kermit, what if I do four or five Celine Dion songs?
You know Celine Dion, she works in Vegas.
No, Piggy, there's no time for that.
What about the band's marathon jam session?
Drum solo!
Drum solo!
No drum solo!
Guys, guys, guys!
We can't just do whatever we want.
This is our opening night.
Let's play to our strengths, because...
Well...
Look, I didn't want to worry you guys but if we don't sell this theater out, it would mean the end of the tour.
What?
And maybe the end of us.
Great news, Muppets.
We're sold out.
What?
Fine.
I mean, great, great.
Well done, Dominic.
Hey, I have an amazing idea for an act.
It's called "The Indoor Running of the Bulls."
Gonzo, I've told you, that act is far too dangerous.
Actually, Kermit, I was asking Dominic what he thinks.
Good grief.
Dominic, Dominic!
Five songs.
"Sold out." Like we've sold out a show in 30 years.
Is this a good time to discuss our upcoming European wedding?
No, actually, I'm kind of busy right now.
Perfect!
I have 23 swatches for the seat covers for the reception, eight font choices for the menu, which, by the way, we are not serving flies.
Piggy, what are you talking about?
I'm just trying to involve you in some of the decision-making, dear.
What about being involved in the decision to get married in the first place, huh?
Kermit, you never let me do what I want!
Oh, yeah?
Well, what about what I want?
What about that?
I haven't even proposed yet.
- You can do that on our honeymoon.
- What?
That's insane!
Do you hear what you're saying?
Insane?
How dare you call your fiancée insane?
You are not my fiancée!
We are not engaged!
And, as a matter of fact, the way this particular conversation is going right now...
Well...
I'm fine with that!
Piggy.
Wait!
I'm sorry!
Get out!
Don't take it personally.
They still love you.
They just prefer me now.
Thank you, Dominic.
That's very comforting.
Do you know what I think helps sometimes in situations like this?
What?
A walk alone in the fog in former East Berlin.
Maybe along a deserted canal.
Well, I guess a quiet stroll is not a bad idea.
Let the others know I've gone, will you?
Sure.
I promise.
Thanks.
Corrine, come here!
Boo.
What just happened?
What?
Wait a second.
Hold on, hold on!
There must be some mistake!
Don't you know me?
I'm Kermit the Frog!
Silence, Constantine.
The game is up.
Who?
No, no!
Wait a minute!
I'm Kermit the Frog!
Guys, this is a mistake!
I'm telling you!
Hey, hey!
Hello!
Somebody!
Open up!
I'm an Amphibian-American!
It's not easy being mean.
Has anyone seen Kermit?
It's 15 minutes to curtain.
Hi, guys.
Look, it's Kermit, just back from his afternoon stroll.
Hi-lo!
I am Kermit.
What...
He's got a cold.
That's why his voice sounds a little bit different at the moment.
See?
Just calm down.
Just relax.
You are right.
Dominic is terrific!
From now on, let's do whatever he says.
All right.
Yeah.
Wow, that walk must have really helped.
Miss Pig, I have wronged you.
I humbly beg your forgiveness.
You're not getting off that easy, bucko.
Come on, Foo Foo.
Bad frog!
Bad frog!
What is this?
Let go, dog!
Animal, stop it!
Kermit has agreed that Dominic is right all the time, man.
Good.
So, now that Kermit agrees with me on everything...
- I am Kermit.
- Definitely.
Let's go and hang out backstage, yeah?
Okay, all right.
Come, little friend.
Let us get on with the show and enjoy our family-style adventure during which we shall bond and learn heartwarming lesson.
Perhaps about sharing, or waiting your turn, or the number three.
Right, Kermit.
Sure.
Flawlessly executed.
Bravo.
What did you expect from world's most dangerous frog and number one criminal, Number Two?
Yeah, I know.
You're number one, I'm number two.
I think you mentioned that before.
Now that we control the Muppet tour, Number Two, phase one of our plan is complete.
We are now positioned to carry out greatest...
- "Burglary."
- Yes.
of all time, and pin it on those gullible Muppets, who will spend the rest of their miserable lives behind bars.
Tonight, we steal the painting and then we'll have all we need to steal the unstealable, the Crown Jewels of England.
Ensuring that my name goes down in history as greatest thief of all time!
You mean our names, right?
Of course.
My name first, then spacebar, spacebar, spacebar, your name.
Sure.
I'm number one You're number two
We're criminals at large But I'm at larger than you
I'm number one
You're number two
I believe in equality
As long as you get less than me
- I'm one
- You're one
You're number two
I'm number two.
You may think that you're smarter
But I'm smarterer than you
I'm number one You're number two
You're lucky to be number two
Not number three
I can see by the look in your eye
You want to get a bigger piece of the pie
One day you'll get your chance
But in the meantime
You've got to dance, monkey, dance!
Really?
I hate dancing.
Do it!
Dance, monkey, dance!
I'm number two He's number one
I can't believe I'm working for an amphibian
I'm number two He's number one
I'm number one!
You know life's gone to the dogs
When your boss is a frog
I can see it's just a matter of time
Before he's gone
And I'm at the front of the line
It won't be long till I get my chance
But in the meantime
I've got to dance, monkey, dance
Dance, monkey, dance
Now, watch me.
- I'm number one
- He's number one
- You're number two
- I'm number two
That's it, kid There you go
Now step aside This ain't your show
- I'm one - "I'm one"
I'm number one
Yes, we know
- I'm...
- He's...
Number one!
That's how it's done.
15 seconds to curtain...
Kermit?
Sure.
Okay.
Have you studied your Kermit tapes yet?
Of course not.
This is child's play for frog of my talent.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome...
"Study Kermit tapes." Nonsense.
It's...
Oh, no.
Kermit!
Introduce the show.
It's the Muppet Show!
With our very special guest star, Christoph Waltz!
What is happening?
Why am I flying?
- What the...
- We gotta do something!
Please welcome our first act,
Herr Christoph Waltz dances the waltz!
Darling, you set my world on fire.
Did somebody say "explosion"?
No!
He says I set his world on fire.
There it is again!
Wait for me!
Please!
Wait for me.
One more!
Keep Waltzing, Mr. Waltz!
Hey!
It was vertigo.
Not stage fright, if that's what you're thinking, Number Two.
Sure.
Right, now to cover our tracks.
Let's get out of here!
CIA.
Interpol!
What is the CIA doing here?
This is my jurisdiction.
Not to mention, my badge is bigger.
One of the stolen paintings was on loan from the New York Metropolitan Museum of Art.
So, this is CIA jurisdiction.
Also, this is my travel badge.
Here's my real badge.
You must have been looking at the wrong...
- Badge!
- What?
You've won this round, Pierre.
- My name is "Jean."
- Okay, Shawn.
It looks like we're gonna be working together.
But that doesn't mean I have to like you.
I didn't like you first.
I didn't like you before I met you.
So, what have we got?
Two priceless paintings stolen and one average painting of an obscure English colonel.
This has all the markings of the work of the Lemur.
What's a lemur?
Only the second most wanted criminal in the world.
And my personal nemesis.
Unfortunately for me, his identity is a mystery.
No, literally, what is a lemur?
It is also a rat-monkey from Madagascar.
Just as I suspected.
This coin is his calling card.
The Lemur, he is playing with us.
I have a delivery here for Mr. Eagle.
Right here.
And here's your rope.
You were saying?
Look at that.
"Muppets sell out in Berlin." Five stars!
Kermit the Frog is liking this news.
Choo-choo, yeah!
Tunnel.
It's not there.
You were wrong!
Not so fast.
Oldest trick in the book.
Write it in lemon juice, then simply apply heat to reveal Colonel Blood's map.
Of course, today, the Crown Jewels lie behind the most sophisticated security system on the planet.
And this map, along with Blood's key and locket, is the only way to get close to them.
Good work, Number Two.
What does it say about location of Blood's key?
Right.
Something, something.
"Finest wooden teeth."
That is not helpful.
Wait.
There's the name of a city here.
Madrid.
You've got the wrong frog!
Hey, hey, hey!
It's Constantine.
- What?
- He's back.
What are you doing?
I'm not Constantine.
My name is Kermit.
Constantine, always with the jokes!
Good old Constantine.
Always trying to pull a fast one.
Old friend.
Since you are back,
I guess you are in charge of prison again.
Here, take prison crown.
We have to readjust it again.
Sergei, you get on that.
Take, take.
Thank you.
Wait a minute.
I've known Constantine for years.
And he has never...
Ever...
Said, "Thank you."
Because I am not Constantine.
- How dare you?
- He's not Constantine!
Let's throw him in the recycling compacter!
Yeah!
Throw him in the compacter!
But I'm already green!
Squash that frog!
Put the frog down.
Or I will deploy.
Where am I?
The Gulag.
A gulag?
Gulag.
The Big House.
The Big House!
Hit it, boys.
This is Russia's premier state-funded hotel

Listen, I'm telling you, you've got the wrong frog!
If you are not Constantine, why do you have that mole?
It's not real.
Someone glued it to my lip.
As far as authorities are concerned, you are Constantine.
Glue or no glue.
Make yourself comfortable.
You're going to be here a while.
I wouldn't be so sure.
My friends will be here soon!
Now, lights out!
Turn them back on!
I can't see anything.
You have to wait until I'm, like, out of the hallway.
It's figure of speech.
Okay.
It seems that Blood's key is hidden in a marble bust of his accomplice, Godfrey the Unknown, which is kept in the Statue Room at the Prado Museum.
Perfect.
We break in, steal the bust, destroy it and grab key.
Yeah, it's not that simple.
You see, no one knows what Godfrey the Unknown looked like.
Of course not.
He was second in command, so no one cared.
And there's 250 statues in that room.
That may be problem.
Let me think, Number Two.
Excusez-moi, Kermie.
Do you have a moment?
Kermit.
I just wanted to say that I accept your apology and I'm ready to put our little disagreement or whatever it was, behind us.
And, perhaps, I was a little too eager about our wedding...
Pig, I have question.
Am I wearing sign that says "Bother Me"?
What was that?
What was that?
I was in the middle of evilly plotting.
I do not like to be interrupted while evilly plotting.
If we're to get away with this, you've got to keep up appearances.
I am keeping up appearances.
If you want the Crown Jewels, stick to the plan.
Do whatever the pig wants.
Keep her happy.
Whatever she asks of you.
Stupid frog!
Stupid train!
I don't want to talk to you, Kermit.
I said, I want you out!
I don't think you know what you want.
Yeah, I do.
I just told you, I...
You're my lady and I'm your man, baby.
And that's why, if you stick with me,
I can give you what you want.
Baby, stop right there
Let me clear the air
Baby, look into these eyes Let me apologize
I know what you're thinking of
You're thinking, "Where's the love?"
Babe, the love ain't gone It's here where it belongs
I know what you're waiting for
Well, you don't need to wait no more
I can give you anything you want
Give you anything you need
I'll make your dreams come true
Give you anything you want

Kermie.
You are what I've always wanted.
Excuse us.
But we are all wondering, what's the set list for tomorrow, chief?
I don't care.
Do whatever you want.
What?
Is he serious?
Kermit, could I do indoor running of the bulls?
Sure, Zongo.
Who cares?
Wow!
Thank you, Kermit!
Kermie, if he can do his thing, why can't I sing my five songs?
Well...
You can.
Who cares?
We don't have time for all this stuff.
We're up to a three-hour show, Kermit.
You are forgetting one thing, small man with glasses.
I can give you what you want.
All right!
Okay.
Indoor running the bulls.
Won't the show be terrible?
Guys?
I'm so confused.
Where are you guys?
Looks like I'm gonna have to break out of here myself.
It's The Muppet Show, with our very special guest star, Lynn Redgrave.
Yes!
Hi-ho!
Kermit the Frog, here.
Hi-lo.
Kermit the Frog here.
The lovers, the dreamers and me
The lovers, the dreamers and cheese
Nailed it.
It's El Muppet Show, with our very special guest, Salma Hayek.
Hey!
- Would you look at that?
- No.
Good idea.
Yes!
Hello and welcome to El Muppet Show.
Please welcome our opening act, the Great Gonzo and the indoor running of the bulls!
Gonzo?
Gonzo, I don't want to do this.
What?
This is gonna be great.
Are you sure about this?
Nope.
Come on.
Let's go.
- Where have you been?
- On stage.
Why did the...
The bulls are out of control!
Who could have foreseen this?
Me.
I did.
Here they come again!
Okay.
Sorry about that, folks, but now put your hands together for Miss Piggy.
I don't believe it.
They've managed the impossible.
What an achievement!
Bravo!
Bravo!
What?
You mean you actually like this show now?
No!
They've made the show even worse!
- Bravo!
Bravo!
- Amazing!
Where is it?
It's got to be here somewhere.
Keep smashing, Number Two.
What do you think I'm doing?
I'm smashing.
Where is that key?
The last one.
It better be in here.
He looks a little bit like you, Number Two.
Colonel Blood's key.
Nice of him to label it.
- So, where is the locket?
- There's more.
Of course.
That's where Blood's locket is.
In the vaults of the Irish National Bank.
Then I know where Muppet tour must stop next.
Dublin.
Drum solo!
A standing ovation?
I am Kermit.
I hope you enjoyed my show.
I love you, Madrid!
Wow, what an audience!
Great show, Kermit!
They loved me, Kermie!
They loved me!
Guys?
I'm not sure that was such a great show.
Like, what are you talking about?
That jam was, like, totally epic.
Exactly.
And I'm glad to say the Spanish reviewers disagree with you as well, Walter.
They loved us.
Five out of five jamón serranos.
Those reviews really came out fast.
And Citizen Kane only got four jamón serranos.
And more good news.
Pack up, everyone.
I've booked our next gig.
In Dublin.
Oh, great!
Now we all have time to rehearse.
Rehearse?
Let's celebrate.
Yeah!
Yes!
You deserve it, comrades!
Go do whatever you want.
Looks like we are busted.
Exactly what are we doing today?
I am doing my job.
All we need to do is look at the map with the blinky lights, and wait.
This is how it is done here in Europe.
In America, we use 3-D satellite LED displays.
Not cardboard with Christmas lights stuck through it.
A blinky light!
She is blinking!
Let's go.
What is this?
A toy?
This is my car, Le Maximum.
It is illegal now in most of the EU for its massive size.
It's so needlessly spacious, I feel guilty.
I hate Europe.
Madrid, here we come!
- Get out of the way.
- Stay on the road!
Interpol!
Watch out, everyone!
37 hours.
Not bad.
The Lemur.
I knew it.
This doesn't make any sense.
Why break in, smash some priceless busts and then not steal anything?
There must be something bigger going on.
But what?
I've got it!
Sorry. 2:00 PM.
My day is over.
Wait.
Those weirdos, the Muppets, were performing next to the crime scene in Berlin.
And here they are, performing right next to the crime scene in Madrid!
You know what that means.
- Yes, they love museums!
- No!
They're suspects!
Okay.
Overtime.
We must find these Muppets before they flee the country.
To the train station!
Hey, Larry, want a bite of my bocadillos?
What the...
Are you all Les Muppets?
Wow, those are big badges!
Thank you.
Come, come.
You must come with us to answer some questions.
Kermit, let's begin Describe the day you played Berlin
We rehearsed, and then we walked about
We ate bratwurst and sauerkraut
That night at 10:03
Were you inside the portrait gallery?
My alibi is watertight
The audience saw me sing all night
Monsieur, we know you did the crime
I was on stage that whole time
Ask who sang Rainbow Connection
Thank you, Kermit, no more questions
I think it's time for good cop/romantic cop.
Miss Piggy, you could end up locked inside
And now's your chance to save your hide
Gentlemen, I did not know
It's a crime to steal the show
Tell us how the art was taken
If you want to save your bacon
I haven't seen your missing art
All I've stolen is audience hearts
We'll catch the swine
That did this job
Give up the pig puns, creep!
Go jump in a lake, that's my suggestion
Thank you, Piggy, no more questions
I think she likes me.
Huh?
I don't think your puns are helping the investigation.
- You know, I think they did it
- No, they didn't
Yes, they did and we can pin it
If they did how did they do it?
If they didn't how did they didn't?
If they didn't then it's easy 'cause they simply didn't do it
If they did it, then I knew it but we've nothing that can prove it
Excuse me.
Let's go from the start
What do you know about the stolen art?
I didn't know there was a plan
Your accusation's far out, man
The chances of us committing a crime are less than .009
I can do an Elvis impression
Thank you, Muppets No more questions
- They didn't
- No, they didn't
There's no way they did the crime
- They couldn't, they're too stupid
- Not criminal masterminds
We do not know who did it But we know who didn't do it
So we know who didn't do it
Yes, we know who didn't do it
They're incapable of being culpable!
Hi!
Come on.
Let's go over the files again.
Stop digging escape tunnel, frog.
How did you know?
It's the first escape everyone tries.
That's the second escape people try.
Oh, boy.
Third way!
Give up, frog.
I have Netflix account with search keywords "prison escape."
I have seen every prison movie ever made.
Even the ones in space.
Yeah, well...
Hey, wait a second.
That's them!
That's my friends!
What happened to them?
"Dominic Badguy.
"An interview with the brains behind
"the Muppets' triumphant comeback world tour."
What?
It seems your friends do not need you anymore.
They have forgotten about you.
No, no, no.
They wouldn't.
They couldn't.
We're a family.
"Family"?
No one believes in family in the Gulag, frog.
People are only ever out for themselves.
Listen, Kermit.
We have annual lighthearted Gulag Revue coming up.
It is that, or they riot.
I thought you might help me.
The thing is, Nadya,
I'm sort of done doing that, but thanks for the offer.
This is not offer.
This is prison.
You are going to help me.
Rehearsals tomorrow, 4:00 AM.
Or I put you on The Wall.
"The Wall"?
Why would I be afraid of a wall?
Just direct the show.
You'll never escape.
What time did you say that rehearsal was?
Okay.
What about this comedian bear?
He is too stupid to be stupid.
He must be some sort of genius.
Maybe your "Lemur" hunch is correct.
Except for the fact that Les Muppets play tomorrow night at the Dublin Theatre.
Which just happens to be next door to the Irish National Bank!
Maybe your Muppet hunch is...
Correct.
It's almost as if we're...
Not so different after all.
Come, come, mon ami!
We must follow Les Muppets to Dublin!
To Dublin!
Kremlin!
Putin!
No, what are you doing?
- Okay, number five, baby.
Blow.
- Come on.
- There you go.
You know the routine.
- Come on, Diddy Daddy!
Hey, guys?
Fellas?
Whoa, man!
Hey, did you see that?
Do you guys think that Kermit's been acting a little weird lately?
No.
You're probably right.
It's just me.
Bad frog.
Enough!
You're all terrible.
Fix this.
Or it's The Wall.
Of course.
Guys...
It's always good to start with an up-tempo song and dance and then go into a comedy routine.
But we like Boyz II Men!
It is Big Papa's favorite song.
Lot of emotions in that song for him.
I'm not learning no other song.
I'm a triple threat!
A singer, a dancer and a murderer!
There you go.
How do you like that?
Drum solo!
Drum solo!
When do I do the indoor running of the bulls?
What about the band's marathon jam session?
Four or five musical numbers.
Quiet!
Now, look!
We are holding auditions tomorrow.
And if any of you have a problem with that, any of you, then my door is always open!
Thank you, Kermit.
This is what we've all been waiting to hear.
Teach us, Kermit.
We will do whatever frog say.
Put it there.
Good night, frog.
Nice work today.
Thanks, Nadya.
Even if your friends don't need you, we certainly do.
Good night.
- Good night, Big Papa.
- 'Night, Nadya.
- Good night, Carl.
- Good night, Nadya.
- Good night, Prison King.
- Good night, Nadya.
- Good night, Skullcrusher.
- Good night.
- Good night, Danny Trejo.
- Good night, Nadya.
No one believes in family in the Gulag, frog.
People are only ever out for themselves.
Well, well, well.
What's he up to?
Gentlemen.
I need this review to go into Friday's paper.
Super positive.
Five stars.
I won't be paid off for a review.
I'm a journalist.
I'm joking, of course.
Cash or credit?
- What was that?
- Rats.
Who cares?
Hand these tickets out to anyone who will take one.
In fact, you may have to actually pay people to come.
It's the Muppets.
It's not gonna be easy.
And I want a standing ovation.
Oh, dear.
Where does he keep all those suitcases?
Let's see here.
What's Kermit doing on the cover of this newspaper?
Dominic's the bad guy!
Dominic's the bad guy!
Fozzie!
Dominic's the reason we've been selling out our shows!
He's been giving away tickets and bribing journalists to write great reviews!
Why didn't we ever think of doing that?
I mean, that's terrible!
The question is, why?
And could it have anything to do with why Kermit's been acting so weird lately?
Hey, wanna see something funny?
Yes, Constantine, the world's most dangerous frog.
Fozzie, what does he have to do with what I just told you?
Nothing, but check this out.
Look, it's Kermit.
What did you do with Kermit?
Wait a minute.
Fozzie...
What if Kermit has been replaced by this Constantine guy?
Nah, that's impossible.
We'd all notice!
Wouldn't we?
Kermit?
Are you there?
Hello?
Kermit?
Everything's fine.
Let's get out of here.
Wait!
We should look around.
Kermit's got a big bomb collection.
Looks like he's planning some sort of comedy heist bit.
I hope not.
Those never work.
What's that?
Oh, no.
What, what, What?
What?
Oh, no.
- We got to get out of here!
- Yeah!
Not so fast.
Where's Kermit?
What do you want?
You have wocka-ed your last wocka, bear.
- Bad frog!
- Animal!
- Oh, good boy!
- Great job!
Thank you.
Quick!
The freight train!
Go, go, go!
We got to go back!
Warn the others!
I tried.
They didn't believe me.
It's our word against his and, well, he's fooled them all.
Should we go to the police?
We don't have any evidence!
I feel terrible.
I'm the one who talked Kermit into doing this tour in the first place.
I wish Kermit was here!
He would know what to do.
You're right.
There's only one guy in this world who can save us.
Only one frog who can restore order, bring justice, and set things right!
You are talking about Kermit, right?
Yes, Fozzie.
Kermit.
Good!
Great!
That's it, guys, that's it!
That's good, guys!
Come on!
And hit it hard!
Okay.
All right.
Yes.
Nadya?
I think perhaps we should, perhaps, keep it prisoners only.
Of course.
I just love Broadway.
But you are right, Kermit, as ever.
Okay.
Thank you.
Okay, fellas, listen up.
Here's who made the cut.
Sergei!
King!
That's you.
You are always right, my beautiful amphibian prince.
I will never let you go.
This is better.
What's wrong?
You only ever knit when you're stressed.
The bear, the little guy and their dog, they are onto us.
They got away.
How are we gonna spin this?
Comrades, I'm afraid I have bad news.
Walter and Fonzie have quit the Muppets.
Wait.
You can quit the Muppets?
Wait a second.
Walter quit the Muppets?
We just did a whole movie where he joined the Muppets.
Yeah, we sure spent a lot of time on it.
I'll say.
Maybe even at the expense of other long-standing, beloved Muppets.
Come on, Robin.
Coming.
Well, as the old saying goes...
The show must continue,
- in a timely fashion.
- Wait.
Fozzie and Walter are part of our family.
We can't let them go without a fight.
Right, Kermit?
I know this is hard, Gonzo.
Walter and Fonzie were my best friends.
Kermit...
Are you sure you're okay?
Yes, I'm fine, pig.
I could never lose you.
You complete me.
Kermie.
Guys, come on!
This is gonna be fantastic.
We should be celebrating!
Yes.
Remember, I can give you what you want.
- Yeah?
- Yeah, right.
- I'll keep that in mind.
- Say, has anyone seen Animal?
Does anybody else feel like we're traveling in circles?
There it is!
Finally!
Do you have evidence to frame the bear?
Excellent.
Where are the guards?
Stay here.
I'm going to check on the vault.
Stop it!
Colonel Blood's locket.
Of course.
Now grab it.
Shawn.
Someone's coming.
Abort!
I think I just saw something.
It's headed back towards the theater!
- That was close.
- Too close.
We need to move to final phase three. "Wedding."
Hey, Kermit, you can't go out there.
It's Piggy's Celine Dion number.
Did you see anything?
Not a thing.
It is my lunch hour.
It lasts six hours.
Excuse me.
Ladies and gentlemen!
I have an announcement!
What?
Kermit,
I'm in the middle of a song here!
Miss Piggy.
I have very important question for you.
Yeah?
What are you doing?
Do you wish to become Mrs. Piggy?
Or rather, Mrs. The Frog?
Kermie, I thought you'd never ask.
I really thought you'd never ask!
So?
What do you say?
It's beautiful.
Yes!
Yes!
Of course!
Yes!
I can't believe this!
After all this time, it was finally just so easy!
That's right, folks, it's the Muppet wedding the world has been waiting for.
We're putting our tour on hold...
What?
to be married in two days' time at the world's most romantic location, the Tower of London.
Here's a Muppet newsflash.
The years of waiting are over.
The biggest "Will they, won't they?" of all times has been answered with a firm, "They will. "
Kermit the Frog and Miss Piggy are to be married!
That's right, folks.
They're finally tying the knot.
Well, at least they didn't get the pot of gold.
No, they did not.
I have never been to a more ridiculous crime scene.
The comedian bear, he was here.
The Lemur.
He, too, was here.
Could the comedian bear and the Lemur be one and the same?
The comedian bear is the Lemur.
That is brilliant.
But why would he steal a bunch of old bones?
The bones apparently belonged to one Colonel Thomas Blood.
He was the only man to ever nearly steal the Crown Jewels of England.
Wait!
Where did the frog say he was getting married?
The Tower of London.
The comedian bear is planning on stealing...
- The Tower of London!
- The Crown Jewels!
The Crown Jewels.
Sir, where would you like the flowers?
Who cares?
Hey, chief.
Hi-lo.
We've all been thinking, and...
Well, after you and Miss Piggy get married, what's gonna happen to the tour?
And to us?
Well, now you guys have all the freedom you want.
You don't need me.
I'm done with Muppets.
But, hey, it's been a good run, right?
Good luck.
Kermit!
Did he just say what I thought he said?
What are we gonna do without Kermit?
The only thing we can do.
Pack up, go to the wedding, and head back home.
Foo Foo, it's always been a fight.
But this is so easy, it just doesn't feel right.
This is my dream come true
The day has come for us to say "I do"
There's nowhere else I'd rather be
Nothing in the world means more to me than you
I've waited so patiently
I knew you were the only frog for me
Always knew this day would come
It's written in the stars It's destiny
So how can something so right
Feel so wrong tonight?
After all we've been through
Why do I feel I don't know you?
We'll settle down and start a family
Have a mini you and a mini me
A little pink frog and a little green piggy
They'll learn to say hello and say goodbye
We'll grow gray and old
And live the quiet life
Just you and I
Hand in hand we'll stay together
Hey.
Look at that sky.
Forever and ever
So how can something so right
Feel so wrong tonight?
After all we've been through
Why do I feel I don't know you?
How can something so right feel so wrong inside?
How can something so good leave me feeling so bad?
How can my dreams coming true
Leave me lonely and blue?
How come the happiest day of my life is so sad?
How can I feel the high when I feel so low?
After all we've been through After coming so far
Is this my destiny?
Where is the love that's written
In the stars?
How can something so right
Feel so wrong tonight?
After all we've been through
Why do I feel I don't
Know you?
Oh, Kermie.
- Hey, the show's starting.
- Yeah!
Lady and gentlemen, good evening and welcome to the Gulag Annual Revue Show!
Escapo, you're up after the ballet.
Okay.
Kermit!
Kermit!
Kermit.
Fozzie.
Walter.
Animal.
We're here to rescue you.
Yes!
And we've got to go right now!
Yeah!
Hey!
I can't believe you're here.
It's so good to see you guys!
Kermit, listen.
An evil frog named Constantine has taken over the Muppets and replaced you!
What?
Constantine replaced me?
Yeah.
And he was working together with Dominic.
They're planning something terrible, but we don't know what.
But...
How could you not have noticed that he'd replaced me, Fozzie?
He looked like you and he talked like you.
Okay, he didn't talk that much like you, come to think of it.
But he said he had a cold.
Animal know.
"Animal know"?
You mean, all this time, I've been locked in a Russian gulag, no one, not one single person from the Muppets except Animal noticed I'd been replaced by an evil criminal mastermind?
It sounds worse than it was.
No.
It's as bad as it sounds.
I thought you guys had forgotten about me.
That you didn't need me anymore.
We'd never forget about you.
We need you more than ever, Kermit.
Good frog.
Late extra!
Late extra!
Read all about it!
Kermit and Miss Piggy to be married in London!
What?
Piggy?
Piggy's gonna marry the world's most dangerous frog tomorrow?
Piggy and the gang are in danger!
To London!
No.
Kermit!
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
I'm in a gulag.
Sorry about that, Ivan!
It's okay!
No problem, Kermit.
It's easy mistake.
Right.
Thanks for not shooting me!
Sure.
No problem...
Hey, nothing personal.
We have to escape, guys.
Tonight!
But how?
Kermit.
Do you know where these prop pickaxes and shovels are supposed to go for this big mining number?
Wait!
I've got it!
And now, folks, the Great Escapo!
Oh, no, you don't.
Nice try, Escapo.
I sure hope this works, Walter.
I have tried a lot of ways to get out of here.
This is gonna work, Kermit.
I'll see you on the outside.
Okay!
Gosh, I hope this works.
Thank you, thank you, everybody.
And now, we're going underground.
Working in the coal mine!
- Bravo!
Bravo!
- Bravo!
Oh, no.
Kermie!
I can't believe that worked!
We did it!
Great work, guys!
Now put the pedal to the metal.
We have a wedding to crash!
Yeah!
That's a nice venue.
The main entrance is too well-guarded.
I'm gonna need to get in some other way.
Here you go.
You're the new guy?
Yes, I am.
Next time, wear a uniform.
Right.
Wow, Kermit, you were like James Bond back there.
Thanks, Fozzie.
Okay, listen, guys.
Walter, you and Animal go look in the chapel.
Right.
- Fozzie, come with me.
- Yes, sir.
- Good luck, guys.
- You, too, Kermit.
Piggy?
Where is she?
Kermit, these are your clothes.
This tuxedo is too tight.
Someone's coming!
Hide!
Hide!
Which room am I supposed to be in?
Here it is.
I hate weddings.
What the...
There you are.
Well, don't just stand there gawping, Number Two.
Come in.
Let us take this convenient opportunity to review our plans.
Once you've stolen the Crown Jewels and framed the Muppets, ring the tower bell five times and we will rendezvous on the roof.
But what will you do when you're married?
Because the pig will know everything.
Once she's served her purpose, kaboom.
It will be bacon for breakfast.
Champagne fridge delivery.
Put it over there on the bear-skin rug.
Thank you!
It's show time.
Fozzie, are you okay?
Yeah, I think so.
How do I look?
You look fine.
You look fine.
Come on, we have to go rescue Miss Piggy!
Right!
Let's go!
The Lemur!
I have you finally!
And Constantine, the world's most dangerous frog!
No, no, no.
As you might say, case sol-ved!
Perfect!
Time for my annual eight-week paid vacation.
No, wait!
What am I supposed to do with them until the mobile holding unit arrives?
On holiday!
No, you've got the wrong frog.
And stay there!
And so you know, Number Two, I have hired us help.
The world's smallest team of jewel thieves.
Babies, meet your new boss.
Genius, I know!
Who would suspect babies of stealing Crown Jewels?
Look at their sweet faces.
Let's see.
Where am I seated?
I'll need an usher.
Usher?
Is there an usher?
Yes.
I'm the Usher.
Pig or frog?
What do you think?
I don't know, man.
Pig?
No.
Frog.
I'm related through marriage.
What kind of an usher are you?
You're up, little dudes.
Go, go, go.
Down.
Tip.
Come on!
What the...
Dominic.
Hey, Dominic.
Shut up.
The wedding, it's starting.
She looks beautiful.
Fozzie, we got to do something.
This is so frustrating!
Wow, would you look at that?
Now that's a poorly made car.
Let's get out of here!
I'm just happy for them.
Really happy for them.
- Would you please stop talking?
- Okay.
Dearly beloved...
What!
Code Red!
Code Red!
Oh, come on.
- Not a laser web.
- Pretty.
Right.
Go and get the suspend-y ropey thing.
- And my really cool skintight outfit.
- Yep.
Shawn, come back from vacation!
Constantine and the Lemur have escaped.
The Crown Jewels are in danger!
We are gathered here today to witness the union of this pig and this frog in Holy Matrimony before the presence of God.
Do you, Kermit the Frog, take Miss Piggy to be your lawfully wedded wife, in sickness and in health, so help you God?
Yes.
Yes, I do.
And do you, Miss Piggy, take Kermit the Frog to be your lawfully wedded husband, in sickness and in health, so help you God?
I...
I...
Just say "I do."
This is what you've always wanted, right?
I do?
I'm sorry, is that a question?
No, it was not a question.
We have to do something, guys.
Kermit, we've got to get you close to Miss Piggy!
What does this do?
- What the...
- Piggy, it's me, Kermit.
Come on, we have to get out of here!
The wedding is off.
Oh, wow!
Like, I kind of knew he'd get cold flippers.
Excuse us.
No, Kermit!
What are you doing?
- Piggy, I will explain later.
- I cannot believe...
Come here, frog!
Where you going?
I'm sorry, my dear, forgive me.
What is going on at my wedding?
- Gotcha!
- What?
Animal, pull!
What is happening here?
Catch froggie!
Catch froggie!
Well, this is the best Muppet wedding ever!
Piggy, listen!
That's not me!
I'm me!
He's Constantine, the world's most dangerous...
Two Kermits?
Well, that explains a lot.
How can there be two Kermits?
Of all the ways to ruin a wedding, this has got to be the most creative.
Two Kermits!
No, just one Kermit.
Me.
No, no, no.
Do not listen to him!
I am the real Kermit.
That's ridiculous!
I am Kermit the Frog!
No, I am Kermit the Frog!
Hi-lo, Kermit the Frog, here.
"Hi-lo?" It's "Hi-ho!"
Would every Kermit be quiet!
Well, there's only one sure way to settle this.
First Kermit.
Will you marry me?
Yes, of course, let's go!
The helicopter is waiting, my love!
And you, the other Kermit...
Will you marry me?
Well, I mean, I...
I would.
I mean, I could.
It's...
That's my Kermit!
That's our frog!
Kissy-kissy!
That is right, Muppets!
I am Constantine, the world's most dangerous frog and number one criminal!
And a thousand times more frog than this Kermit person!
And now,
I have only one thing to say to you fools!
Good night, folks!
What is that?
It's a bomb!
This is where my patented magnetic bomb-attractor vest can aid us, that Beaker is conveniently wearing.
What?
What's going on?
Wait!
Miss Piggy's ring is the bomb!
Some of you guys grab Piggy, and some of you guys grab me.
Pull!
That's only 800 years old.
Nicely done, Beaker!
Kermit!
Help!
- Piggy!
- Help!
She's on the roof!
Shut up and keep moving, pig!
You are my insurance policy!
Number Two, you look ridiculous.
Why are you wearing that?
Because I am the Lemur.
And the world's new number one criminal.
That's right.
This is where I double-cross you.
First rule of double-cross.
You don't announce the double-cross before you double-cross.
It's not even a rule because it is so obvious.
The Lemur is literally the worst bad guy name I have ever heard!
Let's go!
Oh, no!
He's getting away!
What are we gonna do?
I'm gonna stop that helicopter.
We're coming!
Hang on, Miss Piggy!
Jump!
Shut up, pig!
Kermit!
We have to do something!
I got it!
There's only one way we can reach him up there!
Muppet Ladder!
- What the...
- Kermit!
Come on up, Chef!
Watch the hair, bear.
Give up, Constantine.
I've got you now!
Bad move, frog.
Kermit!
Okay, Kermit, we're coming to get you.
Now!
No, something's wrong.
We're not moving.
You're ruining my getaway!
Hang on, Piggy!
I'm coming!
Go get 'em, Kermit!
Kermie!
Welcome aboard, Kermit.
You don't know who you're dealing with.
I am the world's most dangerous frog.
Oh, brother!
You may be the world's most dangerous frog, but you're still a frog!
No one tricks me into marrying them and then hurts my Kermie!
What a woman!
Yeah.
My woman.
And I believe this belongs to you.
Well, I'm sorry I ruined your wedding.
Oh, Kermie.
I'm so glad you did.
Okay.
Can we get down now?
We did it, guys!
What an action sequence!
You sure look pretty, Miss Piggy.
Thank you.
Congratulations, weirdos, you've saved the Crown Jewels!
And you've caught my nemesis, the Lemur.
Look at his little costume.
That's adorable!
- I'm not adorable.
- He is adorable.
You're adorable!
Did you make that kitty-cat outfit?
The bad guy is Dominic Badguy!
Well, mon ami, I guess this is where we say goodbye.
You go your way, and I go mine.
Here comes the rain.
Oh, boy.
And I said I wasn't going to do this.
Pull yourself together, man.
Stop crying.
We're only saying our final farewell.
Goodbye forever!
I'm going to miss you so much!
I'm going to miss you, my French friend.
Whenever you're ready.
- Yes.
- Yes, of course.
- Take them away!
- Take them away!
- Thank you.
- Au revoir, Muppets.
- Bye-bye.
- See you!
You're number two
- Sam.
- Shut up.
Sam!
Wait for me!
You know, I missed all of you so much.
There he is, right there!
Arrest him!
Arrest that frog!
Nadya?
Wait.
For what?
For leading the largest mass break-out in Gulag history.
You will get 30 years.
Maybe 50.
- But"
- No "buts," Kermit.
You didn't finish Gulag Annual Revue, and you didn't even say goodbye.
- What?
- What?
You are coming with me.
Now, move!
Fellas, listen.
Easy.
No, no, no!
Kermit!
Wait!
We're sorry, Kermit.
We're sorry that we didn't notice you were missing.
We're sorry we didn't tell you often enough how much you mean to all of us.
We're sorry we ever took you for granted.
But that's never going to happen again.
Because if Kermit has to go back to the gulag, you'll have to take me, too.
No.
You're my best friend, Kermit.
Wherever you go, I go.
You'll have to take me, too.
And me.
Kermit, we convinced ourselves that evil frog was you because he gave us what we thought we wanted.
When what we really wanted...
What we really needed...
Was you, Kermit.
The actual, real you.
It would appear you were right, Kermit.
I guess this is your family.
And families belong together.
You are free to go.
Forever.
Kermit, did you hear that?
We're free!
Nadya, thank you!
Great!
That's wonderful!
Wait!
Hey, guys, listen.
We still have to finish our world tour.
And I know where we need to play next.
For one night only,
Siberia, Russia!
Yes, yes!
I'll pack my swimsuit right away!
Wonderful!
It's terrible.
You will hate it.
You will hate it.
Okay, guys, this is it.
The Gulag Finale!
Here we go!
A-one, two, three, four!
Together again, again
Gee, it's good to be together again, again
I just can't imagine that you've ever been gone
It's not starting over It's just going on
Together again, again
Now we're here
And there's no need remembering when
Because no feeling feels like that feeling
Together again
Again, again, again
Together again, again
Gee, it's good to be together again, again
I just can't imagine that you've ever been gone
It's not starting over
It's just going on
Together again, again
Now we're here
And there's no need remembering when
'Cause no feeling feels like that feeling
Together again
Again
I just can't imagine that you've ever been gone
It's not starting over It's just going on
Together again, again
Gee, it's good to be together again, again
'Cause no feeling feels like that feeling
Together a-...
Together again!
Okay, Nadya, this is it.
Your solo.
Kermit!
Oh, boy.
- Hey, pull the rope!
- Oh, right.
This cast is really heavy.
Rowlf, come here.
Come here, come here.
Yeah, what do you got there?
Take this.
You should have negotiated a smaller font size.
I believe I may have something that could help.
This is my automated end-crawl operating machine.
All I have to do is push this button and it will crawl all by itself.
Let's try this.
Another qualified success.
Check this out.
You can go home now, Ma.
The movie is over.
(CHEERY WHISTLING)
-MAN:
And cut!
-(EXCITED CHATTER)
-Wow.
That was so amazing!
-Walter, you did a wonderful job.
Thank you, Kermit.
Did we get that?
-MISS PIGGY:
We got it.
-We got it, yup.
Movie's over, people.
Go home.
That is a wrap.
Okay, nice work, everyone.
Make sure to fill out your I-9s, and we'll see you on the next one.
(SIGHS)
So, uh...
What do we do now?
Well, we're together again.
We got the theater and all our fans are back.
-Yeah!
-(CRICKETS CHIRPING)
Actually, those were extras.
I saw a few tapping their toes.
Yeah, those were paid dancers.
-Oh.
-MISS PIGGY:
Or...
Maybe since we're all here, now could be the perfect time for you and me to tie the knot, Kermie!
(STAMMERING) Well, I mean, maybe I could.
Hey, what's the camera still doing here?
Oh, no.
Disaster!
That can only mean one thing.
-Doggone it, you're right!
-Mmm-hmm.
It looks like they've ordered a sequel.
(BOTH LAUGHING)
(SINGING) We' doing a sequel
We're back by popular demand
Come on, everybody, strike up the band!
We're doing a sequel
That's what we do in Hollywood
And everybody knows
That the sequel's never quite as good
A sequel Another feature attraction
Places, please Light the lights
Roll camera, "Action!"
I thought it was the end
But no, my friends, this is when
We get to do it all again!
do it all again
Until the credits roll
We got another go to show them
We can do it all again!
(CLUCKING)
We're doing a sequel There's no need to disguise
The studio considers us a viable franchise
We're doing a sequel How hard can it be?
We can't do any worse than The Godfather lll
We're doing a sequel The studio wants more
While they wait for Tom Hanks
To make Toy Story 4!
I thought it was the end
But no, my friends, this is when
We get to do it all again!
do it all again!
Until the credits roll
We've got another go to show them
We can do it all again!
(SQUAWKING)
MAN 1 :

WOMAN:
Sending over to wardrobe!
MAN 2:
We're taking this set apart.
Oh!
We're doing a sequel
Let's give it a go
With Hollywood stars
And more one-liner cameos
We're doing a sequel I don't mean to be a stickler
But this is the seventh sequel
To our original motion picture
MUPPETS:
We' doing a sequel
(SCREAMING)
Let's give it a shot
All we need now is a half-decent plot
(SPEAKING) Got it.
An epic love story between a very handsome, long-nosed purple thing
-and a beautiful chicken.
-(CLUCKS)
Gonzo with the Wind.
Does anybody have any other ideas?
Oh!
Oh!
It's about getting the Muppets back together again to stop an evil oil baron from demolishing the old studio!
Fozzie, did you even watch our last film?
How about one of those fish out of water movies?
Yeah, I'm not so sure about that, Lew.
It's about a frog who marries a beautiful, perfect pig.
And they have to kiss each other a lot!
Uh... (SPEAKING MOCK SWEDISH)
I don't think Americans watch subtitled films. (SIGHS)
How about a movie where you don't make a movie?
And we all get to go home early!
(BOTH LAUGHING)
Good grief.
-(PLAYING PIANO)
-It's about a lonely dog, and one night he sees something he should never have seen.
And he has to live with a terrible secret.
That sounds a little dark, Rowlf.
Kermit, how about the Muppets go on a world tour?
That's perfect!
MUPPETS: (SINGING) I thought it was the end
But no, my friends, this is when
We get to do it all again!
Until the credits roll
We've got another go to show them
We can do it all again!
We're doing a sequel lt's more of the same Let's give it a name
How about The Muppets Again?
It's the Muppets again with The Muppets Again lt's the

Muppet news flash.
Constantine, the world's most dangerous frog, has escaped from a maximum security gulag in Siberia, Russia.
This move has leapfrogged Constantine to the number one most wanted criminal in the world, one place ahead of the mysterious Lemur.
Wow.
Thanks for seeing me at my regular booth, Muppets.
-Big fan.
Huge.
-(MUPPETS MURMURING)
Dominic.
International tour manager.
"Dominic Badguy"?
It's pronounced "Bad-gee." (CLEARS THROAT) It's French.
MUPPETS:
Ah!
It means "good man."
-Oh, yes.
-Oh!
Listen up.
You're hot.
You're having a moment.
But what is inevitable about a moment?
It ends.
I don't want this moment to end!
That's why we got to get out there now and capitalize on this moment with a capital "C," yeah?
I want you to conquer the world.
Do an international tour.
Show a global audience what you can do.
-(EXCITED CHATTER)
-Yeah, that sounds great but I'm just not sure...
Wait a second, guys, listen.
I'd love to do that, too.
But we've barely gotten back together.
We don't want to mess that up.
Okay, I am inundated with offers of management at the moment.
One Direction, U2, Cirque du Soleil.
Just some of the acts I can list.
-(EXCLAIMING IN AWE)
-Wow, that's a good list!
And now, I wanna tour manage you guys.
I know you're the boss, Kermit.
I wouldn't interfere with that.
We would share our managerial roles because you've got a special bond with these little guys.
-Sure.
-(CELL PHONE RINGING)
Uh...
Oh!
(SCOFFS)
President Clinton?
-(MUPPETS GASPING)
-What?
I'm on my way, Number Two.
Great, they're taking the bait.
-Well, he seems like a nice guy.
-ROWLF:
Yeah.
Humble and honest.
I just...
I think we have to get settled first, you know?
Hone the show, get some new material, and then maybe go on a world tour.
DOMINIC:
See you in Berlin.
CONSTANTINE:
Yes.
Auf Wiedersehen,
Number Two.
(CHUCKLES EVILLY
So...
What's it gonna be, Muppets?
Ready to be world famous?
No pressure, but I am a very busy man.
-(CELL PHONE RINGING)
-Oh!
That's Rihanna.
I really should take this.
(MUPPETS TALKING INDISTINCTLY
World tour!
World tour!
Well, I mean...
I guess we could always hone our acts on the road, and that would be okay.
Wouldn't it, Kermit?
ANIMAL:
World tour!
World tour!
Come on, froggy!
(INDISTINCT TALKING CONTINUES)
Okay, let's do it.
-Dominic, you're hired.
-(CHEERING)
Thanks, Kermit.
I mean, boss.
You won't regret this.
(WOMAN ANNOUNCING INDISTINCTLY OVER PA)
KERMIT:
Is everybody here?
Yeah?
Okay, guys, guys.
Gather round and listen up.
If we're going to go on a world tour,
I thought we should travel in classic style.
So...
I booked us a tour train!
ALL CLAMORING EXCITEDLY
No, guys, not that train.
This train.
(WHISTLE BLOWS)
Isn't she a beauty?
ALL SIGH DISAPPOINTEDLY
All aboard, guys!
Beauregard's licensed to drive a train?
It's like a big car, but with no steering wheel, so it's easier.
Get them up and move them out.
All aboard, Dominic.
I didn't know there was still third class.
Third class?
How about no class?
(BOTH LAUGH)
Oh!
Watch the heels!
Piggy, why do you need so much luggage?
For our honeymoon, of course!
-For our what?
-FOZZIE:
Hey, guys!
The dining car has an observation deck.
Oh, wait, the dining car doesn't have a roof.
BEAUREGARD:
Let's go, guys!
Oh!
Oh.
That must be reverse.
Oh, well.
This way looks good, too.
(ROCK MUSIC PLAYING)
KERMIT:
Okay, dominic, I thought we could start our world tour in London.
DOMINIC:
Orhow about the world capital of comedy?
Berlin, Germany.
-(MUPPETS CHEERING)
-ANIMAL:
Germany!
Hmm?
Uh...
Was that supposed to happen?
KERMIT:
Oh, you guys are gonna love this place.
-Hmm?
-Uh...
Okay, here we are, guys.
The Hole in the Wall Club!
"Die Muppets"?
Looks like they put the reviews up early.
Yeah, or is that the suggestion box?
(BOTH LAUGHING)
MISS PIGGY: "Hole in the Wall Club"?
More like "Hole in the Ground Club."
Okay, everybody.
So, we'll start at the bottom and work our way up.
I've booked us into cabaret bars and coffee houses all across the industrial cities of Northern Germany.
Dusseldorf, Hamburg, Mudburg, Vomitdorf.
Poopenburgen?
Fozzie, we have a solid week booked in Poopenburgen.
Kermit, we are professional performers.
Actors, musicians, and...
Others.
Gee, guys, nobody ever said this would be easy.
We have to start small.
Then go huge?
Well, then go slightly less small.
And then a touch less small until we're small-to-medium-small.
ALL GROAN)
DOMINIC:
This looks great.
And I think we should commend Kermit on his efforts.
KERMIT:
Thank you, Dominic.
Thanks.
-Or, if I might be so bold...
-Uh-huh?
...maybe we could consider another venue.
Another venue?
To be precise, this other venue.
-MUPPETS:
Whoa!
-Look at that theater!
What?
No, no.
We don't have the money to rent the Berlin National Theater!
We'll make our money back when we sell it out.
Kermie, I've always dreamed of playing the Berlin National Theater.
"Ich bin ein Berliner."
More like, "Ein frankfurter"!
-(MUPPETS CHUCKLING)
-Watch it, buster.
Guys, I'm not sure we can do this, you know?
DOMINIC:
Okay, let's put this to the vote.
All those in favor of believing in ourselves, raise your hands.
-(INDISTINCT TALKING)
-That's not what I'm saying.
And all those in favor ofjust giving up.
(SIGHING)
I can't believe I'm voting for giving up.
Good.
Well, I'm glad we made this decision.
Oh, wonderful!
So cool!
WALTER:
Isn't that exciting.
I can't believe it.
All right, gather round, troops.
Everybody?
-ALL TALKING INDISTINCTLY
-Okay, guys.
Since we're playing such a big theater, let's stick with what we know.
We'll open with a cabaret number...
Kermit, when do I do the indoor running of the bulls?
(BULL BELLOWING)
ALL EXCLAIMING)
Mr. Kermit, sir?
I would very much like to demonstrate my magnetic bomb-attractor vest.
(SPEAKING GIBBERISH)
Bunsen, why would you even invent one of those?
Why did I invent the automatic drowning helmet?
The extra sharp chair?
Or the unexpectedly exploding cupcake?
-(SCREAMS)
-ALL GASP)
Because it's there, Kermit.
Because it's there.
Hey, what about Muppet Ladder?
Muppet Ladder?
That's never, ever worked, Gonzo.
Last time we all tried that was 20 years ago and you ended up in a cast for six months.
Yeah, good times.
Kermit, what if I do four or five Celine Dion songs?
You know Celine Dion, she works in Vegas.
No, Piggy, there's no time for that.
What about the band's marathon jam session?
Drum solo!
Drum solo!
No drum solo!
ALL TALKING INDISTINCTLY
Guys, guys, guys!
We can't just do whatever we want.
This is our opening night.
Let's play to our strengths, because... (SIGHS)
Well...
Look, I didn't want to worry you guys but if we don't sell this theater out, it would mean the end of the tour.
-ALL GASP)
-GONZO:
What?
And maybe the end of us.
Great news, Muppets.
We're sold out.
What?
ALL TALKING EXCITEDLY
Fine.
I mean, great, great.
Well done, Dominic.
Hey, I have an amazing idea for an act.
It's called "The Indoor Running of the Bulls."
Gonzo, I've told you, that act is far too dangerous.
Actually, Kermit, I was asking Dominic what he thinks.
Good grief.
MISS PIGGY:
Dominic, Dominic!
Five songs.
ALL CLAMORING)
"Sold out." Like we've sold out a show in 30 years.
Ahem.
Is this a good time to discuss our upcoming European wedding?
No, actually, I'm kind of busy right now.
Perfect!
I have 23 swatches for the seat covers for the reception, eight font choices for the menu, which, by the way, we are not serving flies.
Piggy, what are you talking about?
I'm just trying to involve you in some of the decision-making, dear.
What about being involved in the decision to get married in the first place, huh?
Oh, Kermit, you never let me do what I want!
Oh, yeah?
Well, what about what I want, huh?
What about that?
I haven't even proposed yet.
-You can do that on our honeymoon.
-What?
(STAMMERING)
That's insane!
Do you hear what you're saying?
Insane?
How dare you call your fiancée insane?
You are not my fiancée!
We are not engaged!
And, as a matter of fact, the way this particular conversation is going right now...
Well...
I'm fine with that!
-(GASPS) -(FOO FOO GROWLING)
-KERMIT:
Piggy, wait!
I'm sorry!
-(FOO FOO BARKING)
Get out!
(KERMIT SIGHS)
(DOMINIC SIGHS)
Don't take it personally.
They still love you.
They just prefer me now.
Uh, thank you, Dominic.
That's very comforting.
Do you know what I think helps sometimes in situations like this?
What?
A walk alone in the fog in former East Berlin.
Maybe along a deserted canal.
Well, I guess a quiet stroll is not a bad idea.
Let the others know I've gone, will you?
Sure.
I promise.
Thanks. (CLEARS THROAT) Ah.

(WOMAN SPEAKING GERMAN)
(IN ENGLISH) What?
Wait a second.
ALL CLAMORING)
Hold on, hold on!
There must be some mistake!
Don't you know me?
I'm Kermit the Frog!
Silence, Constantine.
The game is up.
Who?
(GASPS AND SCREAMS)
No, no!
Wait a minute!
I'm Kermit the Frog!
Guys, this is a mistake!
I'm telling you!

Hey, hey!
Hello!
Somebody!
-Open up!

It's not easy being mean.

(MUPPETS TALKING INDISTINCTLY
Has anyone seen Kermit?
Whoa!
It's 1 5 minutes to curtain.
Hi, guys.
Look, it's Kermit, just back from his afternoon stroll.
Hi-lo!
I am Kermit.
-What...
-Hmm.
DOMINIC:
He's got a cold.
That's why his voice sounds a little bit different at the moment.
-ALL AGREEING) -(COUGHS)
See?
Just calm down.
Just relax.
-You are right.
Dominic is terrific!
-Aw.
From now on, let's do whatever he says.
Hmm?
ALL:
All right.
Yeah.
Wow, that walk must have really helped.
Miss Pig, I have wronged you.
I humbly beg your forgiveness.
You're not getting off that easy, bucko.
Come on, Foo Foo. (HARRUMPHS)
(SNIFFING) Bad frog!
Bad frog!
(YELLING)
What is this?
Let go, dog!
Animal, stop it!
Kermit has agreed that Dominic is right all the time, man.
DOMINIC:
Good.
So, now that Kermit agrees with me on everything...
-I am Kermit.
-Definitely.
Let's go and hang out backstage, yeah?
Okay, all right.
Come, little friend.
Let us get on with the show and enjoy our family-style adventure during which we shall bond and learn heartwarming lesson.
Perhaps about sharing, or waiting your turn, or the number three.
Hmm?
Um...
Right, Kermit.
Uh...
Sure.
Flawlessly executed.
Bravo.
What did you expect from world's most dangerous frog and number one criminal, Number Two?
Yeah, I know.
You're number one, I'm number two.
I think you mentioned that before.
Now that we control the Muppet tour, Number Two, phase one of our plan is complete.
We are now positioned to carry out greatest... (MUMBLING)
Burgle...
-"Burglary."
-Yes.
...of all time, and pin it on those gullible Muppets, who will spend the rest of their miserable lives behind bars.
-Hmm.
-Tonight, we steal the painting and then we'll have all we need
to steal the unstealable, the Crown Jewels of England.
Ensuring that my name goes down in history as greatest thief of all time!
You mean our names, right?
Of course.
My name first, then spacebar, spacebar, spacebar, your name.
DOMINIC:
Sure.
(SINGING) I'm number one You're number two
We're criminals at large But I'm at larger than you I'm number one
You're number two I believe in equality
As long as you get less than me
-l'm one
-You're one
You're number two
I'm number two.
You may think that you're smarter
But I'm smarterer than you I'm number one You're number two
You're lucky to be number two
-Not number three -(GROANS) I can see by the look in your eye
You want to get a bigger piece of the pie
One day you'll get your chance
But in the meantime
You've got to dance, monkey, dance!
Really?
I hate dancing.
Do it!

(CONSTANTINE GRUNTING) I'm number two He's number one
I can't believe I'm working for an amphibian I'm number two He's number one

When your boss is a frog l can see it's just a matter of time
Before he's gone

(POLICE SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY OVER RADIO)
CIA.
Interpol!
What is the CIA doing here?
This is my jurisdiction.
Not to mention, my badge is bigger.
One of the stolen paintings was on loan from the New York Metropolitan Museum ofArt.
So, this is CIA jurisdiction.
Also, this is my travel badge.
-Here's my real badge.
-Oh.
You must have been looking at the wrong...
-Badge!
-What?
(SIGHS) You've won this round, Pierre.
-My name is "Jean."
-Okay, Shawn.
It looks like we're gonna be working together.
But that doesn't mean I have to like you.
I didn't like you first.
I didn't like you before I met you.
So, what have we got?
Two priceless paintings stolen and one average painting
-of an obscure English colonel.
-Hmm.
This has all the markings of the work of the Lemur.
What's a lemur?
Only the second most wanted criminal in the world.
And my personal nemesis.
Unfortunately for me, his identity is a mystery.
No, literally, what is a lemur?
Oh.
It is also a rat-monkey from Madagascar.
-Oh.
-A-ha!
Just as I suspected.
This coin is his calling card.
The Lemur, he is playing with us.
I have a delivery here for Mr. Eagle.
Right here.
-And here's your rope.
-Mmm.
You were saying?
Here is the lemur file.
It is everything we have on him.

Look at that.
