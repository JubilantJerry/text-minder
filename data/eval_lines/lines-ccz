Anything you wish, my darling.
Until tonight, then...
I'm feeling blue
Just thinking of you
I get out of bed
Wish I was dead
And I hope you do, too
So I've given up I've thrown in the towel
I've taken all the pills
The law will allow
And so I'm feeling blue
- Sir?
- Give me the strongest thing you've got.
- On second thoughts, a Black Russian.
- Very well, sir.
I guess I'm just
Screwed
Frank.
I thought I'd find you here.
Ed, sit down.
Pull up a memory or two.
You left before I could talk to you.
Is it just my imagination or is the whole world crazy?
No, it's just a small percentage of the population, Frank.
I hope you're right.
It's just that I don't know if I fit in any more.
You're still thinking about Jane, aren't you?
She's part of my life, Ed.
Always will be.
I think about her constantly.
But it's done.
When she said, "Get out of my life forever," I knew it was over.
Sometimes I think about you and Edna, and I envy you, because you've had the same person every day for over 30 years.
You wake up with her, eat with her, sleep with her...
You make love to the same woman.
You spend every possible waking moment together, while I'm out with 20-year-olds who just want to have fun and cheap sex.
Girls who can't say no, who can't get enough.
"More, more, more!
It's your turn now to wear the handcuffs."
I just want to love, Ed.
I'm sure you'll find love.
- I already have one.
- It's from the lady.
Go to her, Frank.
Go on!
I'll see you in the morning.
- Excuse me.
- Pardon me.
Sorry.
This isn't easy to say.
I'm lonely, I'm lost.
I need someone to hold, to love.
Frank!
Over here.
Well...
- What are you doing here?
- I called your hotel, got no answer.
Then I tried the station house.
I thought maybe you'd be here.
- Good evening, Sam.
- Mr. Drebin.
Jane.
Always nice to see nice people.
Sam, play our song.
Just one more time.
Of course.
Ding dong, the witch is dead Which old witch?
The wicked witch...
Sam.
That's enough.
Play the other one, please.
You can't let old hurts die, can you?
You walk out of my life, no explanation...
- Didn't you get the letters?
- Every one of them.
I didn't open them.
I tore them up and threw them in the fire.
So you didn't get the cheque for $75,000 that your uncle left you in his will?
Why are you here?
I remembered something about the crime.
Outside the window, I saw a red van parked across the street.
Red van?
Thank you, that'll be very helpful.
You've said your piece, you can go now, right?
That's not my only reason for being here.
- I want us to be friends.
- Sure, friends...
I bet if I dusted you for prints, they'd be your lover Quentin's.
You!
I see a certain kitten still knows how to scratch.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have done that.
We're no good together.
All you ever lived for was police work.
You were always busy saving the "end zone" layer.
Ozone layer!
Frank, you never tried to understand.
How can you say that, when I sank every penny into buying 1,000 acres of Brazilian rainforest.
Then I had it slashed so we could build our dream house.
Frank!
How could you be so insensitive?
Insensitive?
You think it's easy displacing an entire tribe?
- You try it sometime.
- I'd better go.
This was a mistake.
I don't know why I came here.
I was hoping that you'd have someone.
I'm single.
I love being single!
I haven't had this much sex since I was a boy scout leader!
I mean, at the time, I was dating a lot.
- I told you the bombing wouldn't work.
- We had no choice.
Look at this headline.
"President to give Meinheimer blank cheque at Press Club Dinner."
That speech is in two days.
- Don't you think I know that?
- We all know that.
Gentlemen, gentlemen...
I know that you're all worried, and I agree.
There's plenty to be worried about.
Like this solar power plant, already operational outside Los Angeles.
Photovoltaic cells.
They convert sunlight directly into electricity.
Fluorescents.
Last ten times as long as a conventional light-bulb.
Uses only a quarter of the power.
Superwindows.
They insulate as well as ten sheets of glass.
An electric car, partially powered by solar panels.
But the truth is, gentlemen, that I'm not worried about any of these things.
Because no one is ever going to know about them.
- What about Meinheimer and his report?
- He's going to tell the President.
Good question.
Why don't we just ask him?
- That's kidnapping!
- Good heavens!
- What about his speech on Tuesday?
- Dr. Meinheimer will deliver his speech.
It is my view that we must rely on coal, oil and nuclear energy.
Our Dr. Meinheimer.
- Oh, my God!
- That's incredible!
Meet Earl Hacker, former arts consultant to Jesse Helms.
As I explained to Mr. Hapsburg, my fee is one million dollars, and, might I add, I'm worth every penny of it.
But you gentlemen don't have any choice.
Do you?
After a good night's sleep, I headed back to police headquarters.
I figured that if I buried myself in police work,
I could forget about Jane and maybe in the process catch a vicious killer before he struck again.
So far we had few clues and no real leads.
I was hoping that the lab boys had come up with something.
Shut it off!
- Take it easy.
- Say your prayers.
- Nice work.
- What?
Can you show us the results from the Research Institute?
We weren't able to get any clean fingerprints, but we did find footprints outside the Institute.
We made plaster casts of them.
A size 91/2 D.
We're running a trace on it.
But more interesting...
We also found this dinosaur footprint.
- A major find from the Paleolithic era.
- Anything else?
Yes, 20 feet down we discovered ancient timbers from Noah's Ark.
About the case...
I'll be leaving for Boston tomorrow where I'll deliver a major address to the American Archaeological Society.
And I'm booked on Geraldo next week.
You're going on Geraldo because of this?
No, my wife is a transsexual Satan worshipper.
Meanwhile, we'll be continuing fingerprint analysis, fiber checks, DNA breakdown and hair samples.
Then, using the microscopic dirt particles on this footprint, we'll get a geological breakdown of the entire city.
- We may not have that kind of time.
- Then maybe this will help.
We found this wallet on the curb outside the Institute.
We haven't examined it thoroughly.
It just came down from the lab.
"Hector Savage".
From Detroit.
I remember this pug.
Ex-boxer.
His real name was Joey Chicago.
Yeah.
He fought under the name of Kid Minneapolis.
I saw Kid Minneapolis fight once, in Cincinnati.
No, that's Kid New York.
He fought out of Philly.
He was killed in the ring in Houston by Tex Colorado.
- The Arizona Assassin.
- Yeah, from Dakota.
- Was it North or South?
- North.
South Dakota was his brother.
From West Virginia.
You sure know your boxing.
All I know is:
never bet on the white guy.
- You've got an address?
- The card says, "Monique De Carlo".
"210 Bleckman Street."
That's the red-light district.
I wonder why Savage is hanging out down there.
Sex, Frank?
No, not right now, Ed.
We've got work to do.
The address we had for De Carlo was in the city's Little Italy.
We went there, hoping it would lead us to Hector Savage and lead us to a clue that would break the case wide open.
That's the cops.
You've got to get rid of them.
All right, I'll handle it.
Quick, hide in the basement.
You'll be safe down there.
- Ed.
- Frank.
- Red van.
- Yes, I know.
Jane said that she saw a red van outside the Institute before the explosion.
- Let's take him down.
- No, he's not working alone.
- Bug the van.
See where it goes.
- Good thinking.
- Nordberg!
- No problem.
Lieutenant Frank Drebin, Police Squad.
This is my Captain, Ed Hocken.
- Is this some kind of bust?
- It's very impressive, yes...
But we need to ask you a few questions.
Listen.
We're looking for Hector Savage.
Where is he?
Why should I tell you?
Because I'm the last line of defense between sleaze like this and the decent people in this town.
Hi, Frank.
We got that D-83 Swedish Sure-Grip Suck Machine you ordered.
It's a gift.
Frank, come here.
Quick!
It's Savage.
He's on the move.
What?
Hey!
Hey!
Stop, stop!
I'm a police officer!
Let's go.
But remember, we can't let him spot us.
Pull over!
Nordberg's bugging device is right on the money.
I'm not kidding!
Stop!
Shit!
He's changing direction.
Stop the car.
Oh, no!
- He's getting closer.
- We should see him any minute.
Keep your eyes peeled.
Oh, no!
Look, he's real close now.
Step on it!
Help!
Stop, stop!
Frank, stop!
Stop right now!
I've had it!
I said stop!
Help!
Drebin, Police Squad.
What do we have?
It's a tense situation.
Savage is holed up in that house.
- Says he's got hostages.
- He could be bluffing.
Anything else?
Yeah.
That red van is registered to one Quentin Hapsburg.
Well, it looks like the cows have come home to roost.
How are you doing, trooper?
Hey, stop firing!
Hold it!
Stop firing!
Stop firing!
Stop firing!
All right, give me the bullhorn.
This is Frank Drebin, Police Squad.
Throw down your guns and come out with your hands up, or come on out, then throw down your guns, whichever you want.
Remember the two key elements:
One, guns to be thrown down.
Two, come on out.
You just try and take me, Drebin!
I've got more if you want them, copper!
- Looks like he's holding all the cards.
- Not all the cards.
How about it?
You can't drive that tank!
You're not checked-out on it!
Don't worry, Ed!
Just keep him busy.
All right, what do you want?
I want a car out front.
Something fun.
A Porsche.
Then I want a plane ticket to Jamaica.
And I want a nice hotel.
No touristy place.
Something indicative of the people and their culture.
We can't do that.
We're calling your bluff.
Now put your hands on top of your head and come out.
We've got you surrounded front and... hey!
Frank, what are you doing?
Where are you going?
Frank!
Frank!
Help!
- Your coat, sir?
- Yes, it is.
And I have a receipt to prove it.
- Telephone call, Commissioner.
- Thank you.
Excuse me.
Yes?
He did what?
How many animals escaped?
Oh, my God!
Good evening, Commissioner.
You're looking lovely tonight.
Do you realize that because of you this city is being overrun by baboons?
Well, isn't that the fault of the voters?
Excuse me.
Thank you all for attending this event in honor of Dr. Meinheimer, who tomorrow will make his historic address.
Along with the President, I pledge to support his recommendations, whatever they may be.
And now, please enjoy the evening.
I'll see you later.
May I cut in?
- What are you doing here?
- I enjoy a good party.
- Why are you really here?
- I can sum that up in three words:
"Quentin Hapsburg." I never liked him from the moment I laid eyes on him.
The man is as dirty as a coalminer's underwear in January.
What's gotten into you?
He's a kind, gentle, concerned man, who cares about people and is not as suspicious as some people I know.
Ask him what his connection is with the van you saw the night of the explosion.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Ask him if he's pals with a two-bit goon named Hector Savage.
Stop it!
You're just jealous because another man can give me the understanding that you never could.
I just hope Quentin is watching right now, because he'll be jealous.
And a jealous man always makes the wrong move.
I'm counting on that!
Mr. Drebin, Mr. Hapsburg would like you to join him at his table.
- Solitaire is a lonely man's game.
- Lieutenant!
I don't recall seeing your name on the guest list.
Nothing to be embarrassed about.
I sometimes go by my maiden name.
Nice party.
I see a lot of familiar face-lifts.
- Do you gamble, Lieutenant?
- Every time I order out.
Que sera, sera...
- You do speak French, don't you?
- Unfortunately, no.
But I do kiss that way.
Excuse me!
You happen to be standing in my place.
Dr. Meinheimer, you remember Frank?
- Uh...
Mister...
- Drebin, from Police Squad.
- You met him at the Institute.
- Yes, of course!
Do sit down.
Thank you, I don't intend to stay.
Let's play another game.
Who's this?
- I wouldn't know.
- He's been a bad boy.
He blew up a building and is driving a van registered in your name.
We own lots of vans.
One of them was stolen three days ago.
Look, Lieutenant, I have nothing to hide.
Maybe, but I'm warning you.
If you so much as sneeze, I'll be there to wipe your nose.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for the first door prize of the evening:
an all-expense-paid trip to the Gilligan Islands.
And to draw the first winner, we would like to ask our guest of honor:
Dr. Albert S. Meinheimer.
- Let me help you.
- That won't be necessary.
I don't understand what's gotten into Frank.
I'm afraid it's merely a case of jealousy, my dear.
You're going to wear all my gears down.
We shouldn't push it like this.
- He gets around marvelously.
- He does.
- Frank?
- Jane.
I just wanted to tell you that I'm sorry about what happened tonight.
- Oh, Frank.
- I need to talk to you.
May I come in?
OK, but the place is kind of a mess.
I was about to make a protein shake.
Do you want some?
No, thank you.
Are you sure?
I'm trying out a new recipe tonight.
Do you know what Dr. Meinheimer will say at the dinner tomorrow?
Yes, he'll endorse energy efficiency and renewable energy like solar power.
- Who else knew that?
- Only me.
And I told Quentin.
And if the President adopts a policy of supporting efficiency and solar energy, who would be the biggest losers?
Coal, oil and nuclear.
- Frank!
Frank!
- Just one more question.
You told me that Dr. Meinheimer had a photographic memory, yet tonight he never recalled meeting me.
That's strange, but he has been under a lot of stress lately.
Does he have any identifying marks?
A scar, a mole, a tattoo, webbed toes or a third nostril?
He has a birthmark in the shape of Whistler's Mother on his right buttock.
I see...
Have you noticed anything different about him?
Only that he is a foot taller and seems to be left-handed now.
Frank!
What are you trying to tell me?
That Quentin has found a double for Dr. Meinheimer and that he will give a fraudulent report to the President?
That's brilliant.
That's a lot better than what I had come up with.
Stop it, this is preposterous!
Is there no end to your jealousy?
Jane, you're hurting me.
- What more do you want from me?
- Can I use your phone?
- Local call?
- Yes.
If you'll excuse me, I have to take my shower.
The phone is in the other room.
You can let yourself out.
Goodbye.
Give me Captain Ed Hocken, please.
Ed, I'm onto something big.
I'll need you and Nordberg tomorrow.
What is he doing in Detroit?
Send him the plane fare and a new pair of pants.
Of the way we were
Memories
Like the colors of my mind
Misty water-colored memories
Of the way we were
Scattered pictures
Of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another
Of the way we were
Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten...
Frank!
Just as I suspected.
Come on, on your feet.
Jane...
What happened to the water pressure?
Jane!
Frank!
I was so frightened!
- What happened out there?
- It's nothing to worry about.
But if I were you, I wouldn't leave until they shampoo the carpets.
- Who would want to kill you?
- Before tonight, only the cable company.
Now I'm afraid it's one of Hapsburg's goons.
He was carrying this.
Oh, Frank!
I feel like such a fool.
- I should never have doubted you.
- There, there...
You couldn't know that the man you were dating was a murdering sociopath.
Oh, Frank!
We have to help Dr. Meinheimer.
- He's in danger.
- Yes.
They'll probably torture him, then kill him.
It's all my fault!
They'll start by tearing out his toenails and then move on to the nosehairs.
Oh, no!
What are we going to do?
If my hunch is right, they're holding him hostage here.
- At the Home Club?
- What?
No!
At this warehouse.
I've got to get going to rescue him.
- You'll be careful?
- Of course I will.
I will...
I guess I'd better be on my way.
I promised Nordberg we'd bake a raisin nutbread tonight.
I can't fight it any more!
I ran away from you once.
I can't do it again.
Will you stay with me?
Please?
Frank, we've got no business doing this.
We've only got a dock pass and your hunch.
Hapsburg is up to something right up to his pretty, imported shirt collar.
It's a perfect day.
This fog'll keep us concealed to Hapsburg's warehouse.
That's not fog.
The number two engine's on fire.
They're putting it out.
Let's run through this one more time.
At 3:15, Nordberg will cut the power lines, knocking out the alarms.
Yeah.
Right.
- Nordberg.
- Got it.
I'll be in the van waiting for your signal.
Are you wired-up?
Yeah.
Right.
When you hear me say, "I love it", you guys move in.
- Check.
- Ready, Frank?
The water's over there.
Hexagon oil commercial number one.
Piloting today's giant oil tankers is a big responsibility.
That's why here at Hexagon's Tanker Captain Training School, future captains go through a rigorous instruction programme.
Through a complicated elimination process, we weed out those less qualified for the day-to-day operation of a 500,000-tonne single hull super tanker.
Only the best will take command of what is essentially a floating ecological time bomb.
Commercial two.
Just the way I like it!
Some day, way into the future, the sun may be able to provide for all our energy needs.
But right now, it gives us a comfortable feeling to know that our home is being supplied by nuclear power.
I know what you're thinking, but we're not worried.
We know that nuclear energy is safe.
In fact, we think of it as our friendly neighbor.
But remember, our friend can't exist without huge government subsidies.
So tell your congressman to keep those government dollars rolling into nuclear power.
I'll have to find another way in, Ed.
They've got killer guard dogs here.
Do you read me?
Loud and clear.
Nordberg, how are we doing?
We're at our destination.
Ed, I'm going to try the roof.
I'm going to try it again.
- Cut the power line.
- Right.
Help!
Come in, Nordberg.
Frank, hold on.
We have a problem.
Well...
It's Lieutenant Drebin.
You were supposed to have been killed last night.
But now I think I'm going to enjoy doing it myself.
It'll be slow and painful.
- What's that smell?
- That would be me.
I have been swimming in raw sewage.
I love it.
I love it!
That's the signal, let's go.
It's stuck.
Give me a hand.
Ed, help me!
Ed!
Search him.
I love it!
He's wired!
Tie him up!
You'll never get away with this, Hapsburg.
- Whatever it is...
- All right, I'll show you.
Let me introduce you to some people.
Of course, you know Dr. Meinheimer.
And you've met Earl Hacker.
Why you son of a...
And then I'd like you to meet the Redmans.
Weekend guests from out of town.
We're going to the Press Club Dinner.
Make sure nothing happens to Drebin until I come back.
Then I want the pleasure of killing you myself.
The pleasure is all mine.
See you after the speech, Lieutenant.
- Freeze!
- That's it.
Freeze!
Don't move!
Good Lord!
Look at what they did to Dr. Meinheimer.
Are you OK, Dr. Meinheimer?
That's OK.
Don't try to talk.
I just can't take this any more.
Garbage like you just makes me sick!
- Ed...
- OK?
I'm just John Q. Public now.
It's just you and me.
- Mano a mano.
- Ed...
I'll teach you to pick on a helpless invalid!
All right, he's had enough!
Somebody help the Captain.
We've got to get to that dinner.
Any predictions, Mr. Sununu?
There won't be any surprises in Dr. Meinheimer's address.
He'll recommend that the President continues our policy of oil dependency, and more dollars for subsidizing nuclear power, as I've recommended myself.
We'll have more on the dinner later and an update on the escaped zoo animals.
This is the most important evening of my career.
We can't afford mistakes.
If you see Drebin or any Police Squad near these premises,
I want them arrested on sight.
I told Jane to meet us at the hotel's rear entrance.
- Where's that?
- In the back.
She'll unlock the doors at 7:30.
- What about Hapsburg?
- Hopefully, she can stay clear of him.
Let's go.
Why, Jane!
What are you doing out here?
The party's inside.
Quentin!
I was just getting a breath of fresh air.
I grew up on Lake Erie.
There's nothing quite like it.
Well, I'm quite sure...
But how fortunate to have found you.
Now you can join me at my table.
Jane!
Something must have happened to Jane.
Bernardo, you've got the keys?
I have a better idea.
Follow me!
Your attention, please.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Thousand points of...
light.
Light, a thousand points of light.
Recession... bad.
Recovery... good.
Yeah, I think I've got that.
Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.
Bésame
Bésame mucho...
Each time I cling to your kiss I hear music divine
Bésame mucho
Hold me, my darling, and say that you'll always be mine
We'd better make our move.
Yeah, I'm thinking about something more up-tempo, like Guantanamera.
No, I mean Hacker!
He's getting ready to make a speech.
Right!
I'll intercept Hacker.
You get the doctor prepared for his speech.
Bravo!
Encore!
Ladies and gentlemen...
- Dr. Meinheimer.
- Yes?
- Or should I say Hacker?
- Drebin!
Look what he's doing to that man in the wheelchair!
- Can't someone help?
- Come on, guys.
Let's get him!
- Give me a shot at him!
- Beating a guy in a wheelchair, huh?
- We'd better get this man first aid.
- Sit tight, mister.
Thank you.
I'm pleased and honored to be with you tonight on this historic occasion.
Tonight, Dr. Meinheimer, as he looks up to the future, no doubt realizes how our dependence on foreign oil has put a stranglehold on the budget.
A lot of cuts will have to be made and some people will be hit hard.
But we'll just keep cutting until we have an impact.
That's the only way we'll be able to move forward.
Now I present to you Dr. Albert S. Meinheimer.
Oh, my God!
He can walk!
He can walk!
It's a miracle!
I can walk!
Get off me, you moron!
Hey, come back here!
Everything seems to be OK now, so without further ado,
I present to you, once again, the man who needs no introduction, the esteemed Dr. Albert S. Meinheimer.
Hold it!
Hold everything!
- Don't listen to him.
He's a fraud!
- No!
- I can prove it!
- What are you doing?
The real doctor has a birthmark in the shape of Whistler's Mother right here!
Obviously a forgery.
We'll see about this!
Drebin!
Hold it!
Frank is right.
There is a fraud in this room, but it's this man!
And he's just given us this signed confession, implicating that man!
No, no, no...
That man
- Quentin Hapsburg.
- They're gone!
- Let's go!
- Let me go!
- The roof.
Come on, Frank, hurry!
Come on!
Tonight, I intend to share with you my report on our need for a national policy based on energy efficiency and clean, renewable energy sources.
Over there!
Frank!
Take cover!
Nordberg!
Cover me, I'm going in!
All right.
Where's Hapsburg?
- Where are you hit?
- It's not that.
- You're on my groin.
- Oh, sorry.
- Where is he?
- You're too late.
Hapsburg has Plan B in in... in...
Where, where?
All right.
Who else is almost dead?
OK, now...
- Talk!
- You're too late, Drebin.
- He already said that.
- Where did he leave off?
"Hapsburg has Plan B in..."
Oh, yeah.
Hapsburg has Plan B in in...
- Where?
Where?
Talk, you low-life scum!
Gee, if that's your attitude, forget it!
I'm right here, Drebin.
Drop your gun, Lieutenant.
I believe you're inquiring about Plan B.
That's where we detonate a small nuclear device.
Your Dr. Meinheimer can talk all he wants.
No one will be left alive to hear it.
Detonation sequence activated.
I'm the only one who knows the abort code.
In ten minutes, this building and everyone in it will be reduced to a pile of rubble.
I'll be safely on my helicopter.
By this time tomorrow, I'll be hunting rhino in Botswana.
What do you think of that?
You certainly seem to be in touch with your anger.
I don't care what you think.
You won't talk your way out of this.
Go ahead!
Threaten me like you have the American people for so long.
But it won't work this time.
You're part of a dying breed, like people who can name all 50 states.
The truth hurts, doesn't it?
Maybe not as much as jumping on a bicycle with the seat missing, but it hurts.
That's as far as you go, Drebin.
Any final requests, Lieutenant?
Yes.
Can I have the gun?
Oh, no.
I'm not going to fall for that one.
Not so fast!
Six minutes to detonation.
- All right, talk!
Give me that abort code.
- OK, I'll talk.
- Six numbers - 2, 1, 7...
- I'm coming, Frank!
Thanks a lot.
- Are you all right?
- I'm fine.
Are you OK?
Yes, but unless we can disarm this computer, the building will blow.
We must warn everyone.
- Jane, you'd better go.
- No, Frank.
I'm staying here with you.
But Jane...
If you're going to be blown to bits, I want to be here with you.
Jane, I promise you that if we ever come out of this alive,
I'll never let my police work interfere with our love again.
Frank.
Frank!
The bomb.
Let's go, Nordberg.
Four minutes to detonation.
- What are we going to do?
- See what you can find in the manual.
Let me see here..."To reset detonation code, press pound sign."
Per your command, the speed of this sequence has been increased.
Detonation now in two minutes.
So instead of spending 2.5 billion dollars on research into nuclear waste disposal, the Federal Government, for only 500 million dollars, or the cost of one B-1 bomber, could reduce the price of solar panels by 90%.
As Albert Einstein once said...
Wake up, wake up!
Wake up, the place is going to blow!
I'll get the lights.
To elaborate on point 102...
Here, read this.
It's an emergency.
"His strong, manly hands
"probed every crevice of her silken femininity,
"their undulating bodies writhing in a sensual rhythm
"as he thrust his purple-headed warrior
"into her quivering mound of love pudding."
Listen up, everyone.
I want you to calmly file towards the exits.
That's it.
Nobody run.
Just walk, single file.
That's it.
If we'll just stay calm, no one will be harmed by the huge bomb that's going to explode.
It's a cookbook, it's a cookbook!
Twenty seconds to detonation.
- What are you going to do?
- 15 seconds.
- It's got my sleeve!
- Oh, no!
10, 9, 8...
- I can't get it.
- Jane, my jacket!
5, 4, 3...
- ... 2, 1...
- Let's get out!
Frank, look!
You did it!
Thank you, Mr. President, for those kind words, but it's all part of the job.
Frank, I'd like you to consider filling a special post I'm going to create.
It may mean long hours, dangerous nights, and being surrounded by some of the scummiest elements in our society.
You want me to be in your cabinet?
No...
No!
I want you to head up a new Federal Bureau of Police Squad.
- That's a great honor.
- It's what you've always wanted.
Congratulations.
Nice going!
- Get in here.
- Thank you, Mr. President.
Thank you.
I'm very honored.
This is something I've always dreamt of, but I'll have to turn down your offer.
You see, I've learnt something this past week about the Earth and about love.
I guess love is like the ozone layer.
You never miss it until it's gone.
Blowing away a fleeing suspect with my.44 Magnum used to be everything to me.
I enjoyed it.
Who wouldn't?
But now I want to be known as "The Environmental Police Lieutenant".
I want a world where Frank Junior, and all the Frank Juniors, can sit under a shade tree, breathe the air, swim in the ocean, and go into a 7-Eleven without an interpreter.
I want a world where I can eat a sea otter without getting sick.
I want a world where the Democrats have a candidate worth voting for.
I may not get there with you, but most of all,
I want a world where I can wake up each morning with this woman, whom I love!
Yikes!
- Frank!
- Jane!
- Jane, will you marry me?
- Yes, of course I'll marry you!
We love Frank!
We love Frank!
One more picture.
Turn around, over here!
Smile!
Help, George!
All right, let's see if I got this straight, now.
Energy efficiency... good.
Drilling in Arctic national wildlife refuge... bad.
Mr. President, is everything OK in there?
I'm fine, thanks.

Thank you.
Great Lady down.

- Easy, watch the table!
Oh, wait.
Wait.
- How are you, dear?
.
- I'm OK, I'm fine.
Good.
Please be seated.
Welcome.
Glad you could all come.
I'm pleased to say that we're graced for the presence of so many distinguished guests tonight.
As we all know, uh, this week we're celebrating
Law Enforcement Week all across the country.
So I'd like to turn the proceedings over to our own Washington D.C. police commissioner, captain Annabelle Brumford.
I'd like now to introduce a most distinguished American.
This week he is being honored for his 1,000th drug dealer killed.
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome lieutenant Frank Drebin of Police Squad.
Yeah, in-in all honesty, the last two I backed over with my car.
Luckily, they turned out to be drug dealers.
- Good.
- Excellent!
Uh, thank you, commissioner Brumford.
Now I'd like to call upon my chief of staff, Mr. John Sununu, to introduce some special guests.
Thank you.
Mr. President, tonight I am extremely proud to welcome our guests from the nation's energy suppliers.
First, representing the oil industry, head of the Society of Petroleum Industry Leaders, better known as SPIL,
Mr. Terence Baggett.
From the coal industry, chairman of the Society for More Coal Energy, or SMOKE, Mr. Donald Fenzwick.
Uh, thank you.
Thank you very much.
And from the nuclear industry, president of the Key Atomic Benefits Office Of Mankind, KABOOM,
Mr. Arthur Dunwell.
As you know, for the past three years, this administration has been trying to formulate a National Energy Policy, one that will have a lasting impact on the way we live for the next decade and beyond.
To make sure that we choose the right path, the President has appointed as his top advisor in this area dr.
Albert S. Meinheimer.
As I'm sure you're all aware, his reputation in this field is without peer, and dr.
Meinheimer will present his recommendations to the Annual National Press Club Dinner this Tuesday evening.
Mr. President.
I want all of you here to be the first to know that I've decided to base my administration's entire energy policy on dr.
Meinheimer's recommendations.
Now, this issue is too important to be left to politicians or special interests to decide.
Rather we need an independent and informed source on which to base our future actions, and dr.
Meinheimer is the recognised expert in this field.
Mr. President... if I may say so,
I do hope that, uh, dr.
Meinheimer won't be influen... influenced by any of the so-called environmental groups.
Well, we're all well aware of dr.
Meinheimer's reputation.
I think that perhaps, uh, he is best qualified to explain his research methods...
- Dr. Meinheimer.
- Great Lady down again.
Ah!
This happens every fucking time when I go shopping!
- Jane...
- Oh, dr.
Meinheimer.
- You're back early.
- And you're here late.
Now, surely, a lovely young woman like you can think of something better to do on a Saturday night.
Oh, oh, oh.
I'm sorry, my dear.
I d...
I didn't mean to be so blunt.
It's... it's all right, doctor.
It's okay.
You're thinking about him again, aren't you?
What was his name?
- Frank?
- Yes.
You just can't forget about him, can you?
- Who?
- Frank.
Oh, yes!
No, I-I can't.
I...
I try.
It's just that... when you've had that much man...
But then, you wouldn't understand.
Jane, you mustn't be so hard on yourself.
You've done a wonderful job here at the... at the Institute.
You're-you're the finest director of Public Relations we've ever had.
Thank you, doctor, I...
I try my best.
But I see you here night after night past ten.
You've got to forget about the past.
Go out, see new people, enjoy yourself.
But there is someone I'm seeing, in fact just yesterday.
I was telling him about the speech that you were preparing for the press...
- Good evening, Ms. Spencer.
Dr. Meinheimer.
- Hello, Norm.
Oh, I completely forgot.
How was the White House dinner?
Extraordinary.
The President promised to implement whatever recommendations I make.
Why, that's wonderful!
Then you're going to deliver the speech that you told me about last week?
Oh, yes.
Every word of it.
I would've given it tonight, but another guest there made such a ruckus I don't believe anyone would've heard me.
Hey, Al!
Ken!
Look at this.
Found this in the waste basket.
Hey!
That's a pretty nice clock!
I wonder why they threw it out.
It's probably because it's four minutes too slow.
Here, let me fix it.
There.
My name is sergeant Frank Drebin, detective lieutenant, Police Squad.
I was in the middle of getting my car washed when I heard the call over the police scanner.
There'd been a bombing downtown and I was on my way to advise the D.C. police as part of the President's "Operation Scum Roundup".
- Hey, you ready?
- Yeah, got it.
As far as police work is concerned, every once in a while something comes up that nothing quite prepares you for.
Somehow, some demented madman, probably full of self-hate, and possibly a couple of months behind in his rent, finally snapped.
- I'm glad you could make it, Frank.
- I got here as quick as I could, Ed.
Oh, congratulations, I understand that Edna's pregnant again.
- Yes, and if I catch the guy who did it...
- Hey, captain.
They just finished searching' the building now.
There's no sign of a break-in and there's no money missing'.
And this was one hell of an explosion.
We're still tryin' to figure out what they used.
- Any other victims?
- Oh, you're standing on one right now.
- Oh, I see...
- Get him out of here.
Ohh, this one's a real mess.
Oh.
Hey, everybody.
Over here, Frank found another one.
He had him missing?
- Any witnesses, Ed?
- Well, there's one.
A woman.
Said she saw a man leaving just before the explosion.
Maybe we should let Nordberg handle this one.
No, I'd better do it while it's still fresh.
Well, not now, Frank.
She fainted dead away.
She took a nasty knock on the head.
She looks pretty bad.
- I'll handle it.
- Sir...
Excuse me, miss, I'd like to ask some questions about....
Uh, Frank, not that bad.
She's being questioned over there by our sketch artist.
I couldn't believe it was her.
It was like a dream.
But there she was, just like I remembered her.
That delicately beautiful face... and a body that could melt a cheese sandwich from across the room.
And breasts that seemed to say "Hey, look at these!"
She's the kind of woman that made you wanna drop to your knees and thank God you were a man.
Yeah...
She reminded me of my mother all right.
No doubt about it.
Frank, snap out of it.
You're lookin' at 'er like she was your mother, for Christ sake.
- Frank.
- Jane.
I didn't know you lived here.
I moved here two years ago.
- How are the children?
- We didn't have any children.
Oh, yes, of course.
- How was your prostate operation?
- Fine.
Good as new.
In fact, it's... better than ever.
Look, Frank, I...
I know this is awkward, but you're not still obsessed with our relationship, are you?
Obsessed?
Who's obsessed?
Just because you backed out on the wedding two years ago?
I'd forgotten all about it.
This... ancient history, like the Democratic Party.
Frank.
He was in tears.
In church, crying like a baby.
- Frank, get a hold of yourself!
- I had to return 13 QuizzArts.
- That's enough, Frank, really.
- Kept the salad shooter, though.
Oh, Jane, there you are.
Hello, Jane.
Dr. Meinheimer.
Frank, this is dr.
Albert Meinheimer.
- Don't get up.
Nice to meet you.
- Likewise, I'm sure.
But I believe we met before, at the White House dinner?
He never forgets a face.
He has a photographic memory.
It's a terrible thing that's happened, here, lieutenant.
I really do hope you find the people responsible.
Well, I'm sorry I can't be more optimistic, doctor, but we have a long road ahead of us.
Like having sex.
It's a painstaking arduous task that seems to go on and on forever, and just when you think things are going your way, nothing happens.
Now, Jane, about this man you saw last night...
Anything can help.
Yes, sir, I gave the sketch artist a description.
Eh...
Ed!
That'll be all, McTigue.
Why don't we get that other artist?
You know, the one that never dates, lives with those two guys...
Yeah, right.
Sorenson!
Jane, I'd like to see the rest of the Institute now.
If you don't mind, dr.
Meinheimer?
Yeah, why, of course.
We should start with the research area.
That's a good idea.
It's right this way.
Uh, Jane, what can you tell me about this man you saw last night?
- Uh, he's Caucasian.
- Caucasian?
Yeah.
You know, white guy.
With a moustache, about 6 foot 3.
An awfully big moustache.
Now, what's this all about?
This is our research laboratory.
There are hundreds of experiments going on, all temperature-controlled by the machinery just below us.
Many of our scientists have spent years on the experiments and are just now making major breakthroughs.
Today, we're going to join together two compounds that have never before...
Oh, my God!
Well, thank heavens the bomb didn't damage the research area.
Yes, but I still can't understand who would do such a thing.
Uh, Jane, I think you ought to know about something.
- Jane, darling!
- Quentin!
Jane, are you all right?
I was so worried about you.
I'm really okay, but I'm glad you're here.
Oh, I'm sorry!
Frank, this is Quentin Hapsburg of Hexagon Oil Company.
- Pleased to meet you, Mr...
- Drebin.
Frank Drebin.
I believe I've used some of your restrooms.
I'm... sure you have.
Are you in some way connected with the Institute?
Well, not officially, but asa matter of fact Jane and I have been seing quite a lot of each other lately.
How is my little hell cat?
Well, that's great.
I've been dating, too.
Nice girl, an author.
She wrote the book on male sexual dysfunction.
You've probably read it.
- I beg your pardon?
- Frank, please...
Oh, it's all right.
I'm sure that we can handle the situation maturely, just like the responsible adults that we are.
Isn't that right, Mr....
Poopy Pants?
- That does it!
- Frank!
Quentin, maybe you should excuse us.
Anything you wish, my darling.
Until tonight, then.
- Sir?
- Give me the strongest thing you got.
- On... second thought, how 'bout a Black Russian?
- Very well, sir.
Frank.
I thought I'd find you here.
Ed...
Sit down.
Pull up a memory or two.
You left before I could talk to you.
Ed, is it just my imagination or is the whole world crazy?
No, it's just a small percentage of the population, Frank.
Oh, I hope you're right.
It's just that...
I don't know if I fit any more.
You're still thinking about Jane, aren't you?
She's part of my life, Ed.
Always will be.
I think about her constantly.
But it's done.
And when I heard her say "Get out of my life forever", I knew it was over.
You know, sometimes I think about you and Edna, that's when I envy you, Ed, because you have someone.
You've had the same person every day for over 30 years.
You wake up with her, eat with her, sleep with her...
Make love to the same woman.
You spend every possible waking moment together, while I'm out runnin' around with some 20-year-olds who just wanna have a good time and cheap sex.
Sex, sex.
Girls who can't say no, girls that can't get enough.
"More, more, more!
It's your turn now to wear the handcuffs."
I...
I just wanna love, Ed.
I'm sure you'll find love, Frank.
- I already have one.
- It's from the lady.
Go to her, Frank.
Go on!
I'll see you in the morning.
- Excuse me.
- Pardon me.
Sorry.
This isn't easy to say.
I'm lonely, I'm lost, I need someone to hold, to love.
Frank!
Over here.
Well...
- What are you doing here?
- I called your hotel, got no answer.
Then I tried the station house.
I thought maybe you'd be here.
- Good evening, Sam.
- Mr. Drebin!
Jane...
Always nice to see nice people.
Sam, play our song.
Just one more time.
Of course.
Uh, Sam.
Sam.
That's enough.
Play, uh, play the other one, please.
You can't let old hurts die, can you?
You walk out of my life, no explanation...
- Didn't you get the letters I sent you?
- Every one of them.
Didn't open them.
Tore them up, threw them in the fire.
Then you didn't get the cheque for 75,000 that your uncle left you in his will?
Why are you here?
I remembered something about the crime.
As I was looking out the window, I saw a red van parked across the street.
Red van?
Oh, thank you, that'll be very helpful.
So, you said your piece, you can go now, right?
That's not my only reason for being here.
- Frank, I want us to be friends.
- Sure, friends...
Bet if I dusted you for prints right now, they'd be your lover Quentin Hapsburg's.
Ohh, you...!
Well, I see a certain kitten still knows how to scratch.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have done that.
Oh, Frank, we're no good together.
All you ever lived for was your police work.
And you were always busy tryin' to save the end zone layer.
Ozone layer!
Frank, you never tried to understand.
How can you say that, when I sank every penny I had into buying that 1,000 acres of Brazilian rainforest.
Then I had it slashed and burned so we could build our dream house.
Frank!
How could you be so insensitive?
Insensitive?
You think it's easy displacing an entire tribe?
- You try it sometime.
- I'd better go.
This was a mistake.
I don't even know why I came here.
I was hoping you'd be happy, that you'd have someone.
I'm single.
I-I love being single!
I haven't had this much sex since I was a boy scout leader!
I mean, at the time, I was dating a lot.
- I told you the bombing wouldn't work.
- We had no choice.
Take a look at this headline.
"President to give Meinheimer blank cheque at Press Club Dinner."
That speech is in two days.
- Don't you think I know that?
- We all know that.
Gentlemen, gentlemen...
I know you're all worried, and I agree.
There's plenty to be worried about.
It's like this solar power plant, already operational outside Los Angeles.
Photovoltaic cells.
They convert sunlight directly into electricity.
Fluorescents.
Last ten times as long as a conventional light-bulb.
Uses only a quarter of the power.
Superwindows.
Insulate as well as ten sheets of glass.
An electric car, partially powered by solar panels.
But the truth is, gentlemen,
I'm not worried about any of these things.
Because no one's ever going to know about them.
- What about Meinheimer and his report?
- Yes, he's going to tell the President.
Good question.
Why don't we just ask him?
What's goin'...?
What...?
- That's kidnapping!
- Good heavens!
What about Tuesday evening and his speech?
Dr. Meinheimer will deliver his speech.
It is my view, for now, we must rely on coal, oil and nuclear energy.
Our dr.
Meinheimer.
- Oh, my God!
- That's incredible!
Gentlemen, meet Earl Hacker, former arts consultant to Jesse Helms.
And as I explained to Mr. Hapsburg, my fee is one million dollars, and, might I add, I'm worth every penny of it.
But, uh, you gentlemen don't have any choice.
Do you?
After getting a good night's sleep,
I decided to head back to police headquarters.
I figured that if I buried myself in my police work,
I could forget about Jane and maybe in the process catch a vicious killer before he struck again.
So far we had few clues and no real leads.
I was hoping maybe the lab boys had come up with something.
Hey, shut that thing off!
And I want that you pay...
- Just take it easy, man.
- Say your prayers.
- Nice work, Frank.
- What?
Ted, can you show us those lab results you got back from the Research Institute?
We weren't able to get any clean fingerprints, captain, but we did find footprints outside the Research Institute.
We made plaster casts out of them.
A size 9 1/2 D.
We're running a trace on it now.
But even more interesting, Frank, we also found this single dinosaur footprint.
- A major find from the palaeolithic era.
- Anything else, Ted?
Yes, about 20 feet down from that spot, we discovered ancient timbers which we believe may be part of Noah's Ark.
That's great, uh, Ted, but about the case...
I'll be departing tomorrow for Boston, where I'll be delivering a major address to the American Archaeological Society.
And I'm booked on Geraldo next week.
You're going on Geraldo because of this?
No, my wife is a transsexual Satan worshipper.
But meanwhile, we'll be continuing fingerprint analysis, fibre checks, DNA breakdown, hair samples...
Then, using the microscopic dirt particles on this footprint, it's a matter of getting a geologic breakdown of the entire city.
- We may not have that kind of time, Ted.
- Well, then maybe this will help.
We found this wallet on the curb outside the Institute.
We haven't yet had the chance to examine it thoroughly.
It just came down from the lab, an hour ago.
"Hector Savage".
From Detroit.
Hey, I remember this pug.
Ex-boxer.
His real name was Joey Chicago.
Oh, yeah.
He fought under the name of Kid Minneapolis.
Hey, I saw Kid Minneapolis fight once.
In Cincinnati.
No, you're thinking of Kid New York.
He fought out of Philly.
He was killed in the ring in Houston.
By Tex Colorado.
- You know, the Arizona Assassin.
- Yeah, from Dakota.
- I don't remember.
It was North or South?
- North.
South Dakota was his brother.
From West Virginia.
You sure know your boxing.
Well...
All I know is, never bet on the white guy.
You got an address in there?
All I got is a card that says "Monique DeCarlo, 210 Bleckman Street."
That's the red-light district.
Wonder why Savage is hanging out down there.
Sex, Frank?
Uhh, no, not right now, Ed.
We got work to do.
The address we were given for Monique DeCarlo was in the part of town known as Little Italy.
We proceeded there, hoping this could be the lead that would bring us to Hector Savage and possibly lead us to a clue that would break the case wide open.
That's the cops.
You gotta get rid of them.
All right.
All right, I'll handle it.
Quick, you hide in the basement.
You'll be safe down there.
- Ed.
- Frank.
- Red van.
- Yes, I know.
Oh, Jane said that she saw a red van outside the Institute the night of the explosion.
- Ohh...
Let's take him down.
- No, he's not working alone.
- Let's bug the van.
See where it goes.
- Good thinking, Frank.
- Nordberg!
- No problem.
Lieutenant Frank Drebin, Police Squad.
This is my captain, Ed Hocken.
- Is this some kind of bust?
- Well, it's very impressive, yes, but we need to ask you a few questions.
All right, listen.
We're looking for a Hector Savage.
Now, where is he?
And why should I tell you, copper?
Because I'm the last line of defense between sleaze like this and the decent people in this town.
Oh, hi, Frank.
Say, we got that model
D-83 Swedish Sure-Grip Suck Machine in that you ordered.
It's a gift.
Frank!
Come here.
Quick!
It's Savage.
He's on the move.
What?
Hey!
Hey!
Stop, stop!
I'm a police officer!
Let's go, Ed.
Remember, we can't let him spot us.
Hey!
Pull over right now!
Nordberg's bugging device is right on the money.
I'm not kidding!
Stop!
Shit!
He's changing direction.
Stop the car.
Oh, no!
- He's getting closer.
- Good.
We should see him any minute now.
Keep your eyes peeled.
Oh, no!
Look, Ed, he's real close now.
Step on it!
Help!
Stop, stop!
Frank, stop!
Stop right now!
I've had it!
I said stop!
Oh, no!
Help!
Frank Drebin, Police Squad.
What do we have here?
It's a tense situation, lieutenant.
Savage is holed up in that house over there.
- Says he's got hostages.
- Could be bluffing.
Anything else?
Yeah.
That red van is registered to one Quentin Hapsburg.
Well, looks like the cows have come home to roost.
How you doing, trooper?
Hey, stop firing!
Hold it!
Stop firing!
Stop firing!
Stop firing!
All right, give me the bullhorn.
This is Frank Drebin, Police Squad.
Throw down your guns and come on out with your hands up, or come on out, then throw down your guns, whichever way you wanna do it.
Just remember the two key elements here:
One, guns to be thrown down.
Two, come on out.
You just try and take me, Drebin!
I got more if you want 'em, copper!
Looks like he's holding all the cards, Frank.
- Not all the cards, Ed.
- How 'bout it?
Frank, you can't drive that tank!
You're not checked out on it!
Don't worry, Ed!
Just keep 'im busy.
All right, Savage, what do you want?
I want a car out front.
Something fun.
A Porsche.
Then I want a plane ticket to Jamaica.
And I want a nice hotel.
No touristy place.
Something really indicative of the people and their culture.
Can't do that, Savage.
We're calling your bluff.
Now put your hands on top of your head and come out.
We got you surrounded front and... hey!
Frank, what are you doing?
Where are you going?
Frank!
Frank!
Help!
- Your coat, sir?
- Yes, it is.
And I have a receipt to prove it.
- Telephone call, commissioner.
- Thank you.
Excuse me.
Yes?
He did what?
!
How many animals escaped?
Oh, my God!
Good evening, commissioner.
You're looking lovely tonight.
Do you realize that because of you this city is being overrun by baboons?
Well, isn't that the fault of the voters?
Uhh...
Excuse me.
I'd just like to thank you all for attending this event in honor of dr.
Albert Meinheimer, who tomorrow will make his historic address.
And along with the President, I too pledge to support dr.
Meinheimer's recommendations, whatever they may be.
And now, please enjoy the evening.
Oh, I'll see you later.
- May I cut in?
- Frank!
- What are you doing here?
- I enjoy a good party.
- Why are you really here, Frank?
- I can sum that up in three words.
"Quentin Hapsburg." I never liked him from the moment I laid eyes on him.
The man is as dirty as a coalminer's underwear in January.
Oh, Frank, what's gotten into you?
He's a kind, gentle, concerned man, who cares about people and is not as suspicious as some people I know.
Oh, yeah?
Why don't you ask him what his connection is with the red van you saw the night of the explosion.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Oh, why don't you ask him if he's pals with a two-bit goon named Hector Savage.
Frank, stop it!
You're just jealous because another man can give me the understanding that you never could.
I just hope you pal Quentin is watching right now, cause I know he'll be jealous.
And a jealous man always makes the wrong move.
I'm counting on that!
Mr. Drebin, sir, Mr. Hapsburg would like you to join him at his table.
- Solitaire is a lonely man's game, Hapsburg.
- Lieutenant!
I don't recall seeing your name on the guest list.
Nothing to be embarrassed about.
I sometimes go by my maiden name.
Nice party, Hapsburg.
See a lot of familiar facelifts.
- Do you... gamble, lieutenant?
- Every time I order out.
Que sera, sera...
- You do speak French, don't you?
- Unfortunately, no.
But I do kiss that way.
Excuse me!
You happen to be standing in my place.
Oh, dr.
Meinheimer, you remember Frank?
- Yeah, uh... uh, oh, yeah...
Mister, um...
- Drebin, from Police Squad.
You met him at the Institute.
Oh, yes, of course, yes!
Oh, oh, do sit down.
Thank you, I don't intend to stay.
Let's play another game.
Who's this?
- I wouldn't know.
- He's been a bad boy.
He blew up a building he shouldn't have and he's driving a van that's registered in your name.
We own lots of vans.
One of them was stolen not more than three days ago.
Look, lieutenant, I have nothing to hide.
Maybe so, but I'm warning you, Hapsburg.
If you so much as sneeze, and I'm gonna be there to wipe your nose.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for the first door prize of the evening:
an all-expense-paid trip to the Gilligan Islands.
And to draw the first winner, we would like to ask our guest of honor, dr.
Albert S. Meinheimer.
- Here, let me help you with that.
- That really won't be necessary.
No, no, no trouble at all.
I don't understand what's gotten into Frank.
I'm afraid it's merely a case of jealousy, my dear.
You're gonna wear all my gears down.
I'm telling you.
We shouldn't be pushing it like this.
He certain seems to get around marvellously.
He does.
- Frank?
- Jane.
I... just wanted to tell you that I-I'm sorry about what happened tonight.
- Oh, Frank.
- Jane, I need to talk to you.
May I come in?
Well, okay, but the place is kind of a mess.
And I was just about ready to make a protein shake.
Do you want some?
No, thank you.
Are you sure?
I'm trying out a new recipe tonight.
Jane, do you know what dr.
Meinheimer is gonna say at the Press Club dinner tomorrow?
Yes, he's going to endorse energy efficiency and renewable energy like solar power.
Who else knew that?
Only me.
And of course I mentioned it to Quentin.
And if the President were to adopt a national policy of supporting efficiency and solar energy, who would be the biggest losers?
Well, coal, oil and nuclear.
- Frank!
Frank!
Oh.
- Jane.
Just one more question.
You once told me that dr.
Meinheimer had a photographic memory, yet tonight he never recalled meeting me.
That's strange, but he has been under a lot of stress lately.
Does he have any identifying marks?
A scar, a mole, a tattoo, webbed toes, a third nostril?
Well, he has a birthmark in the shape of Whistler's Mother on his right buttock.
I see, well...
Have you noticed anything different about him?
Well, only that he is a foot taller and he seems to be left-handed now.
Frank!
What are you trying to tell me?
That Quentin has somehow found an exact double for dr.
Meinheimer and that tomorrow that double will give a fraudulent report to the President?
Why, that's brilliant.
That's a lot better than what I'd come up with.
Frank, stop it.
This is preposterous!
Is there no end to your jealousy?
Jane, you're hurting me.
- What more do you want from me?
- Can I use your phone?
- Local call?
- Yes.
All right.
If you'll excuse me, I have to take my shower.
The phone is in the other room.
You can let yourself out.
Goodbye.
Uh, give me captain Ed Hocken, please.
Ed, I'm onto something big.
Gonna need you and Nordberg tomorrow.
What's he doing in Detroit?
Well, send him plane fare and a new pair of pants.
Frank!
Just as I suspected.
Come on... on your feet.
Jane...
- Jane.
- Hey, what happened to the water pressure?
Jane!
Jane!
Jane!
Frank!
Oh, I was so frightened!
- What happened out there?
- It's nothing.
It's nothing to worry about.
But if I were you, I wouldn't leave until they had a chance to shampoo the carpets.
- Who would wanna kill you, Frank?
- Before tonight, only the cable company.
But now I'm afraid it's one of Hapsburg's goons.
He was carrying this.
Hapsburg Valdez.
Oh, Frank!
I feel like such a fool.
- I should have never doubted you.
- There, there...
You had no way of knowing the man you were dating was a vicious murdering sociopath.
Oh, Frank!
We have to help dr.
Meinheimer.
- He's in danger.
- Yes.
They'll probably torture him, then kill him.
It's all my fault!
They'll probably start by tearing out his toenails and move on to the nosehairs.
Oh, no!
What are we gonna do?
If my hunch is right, they're holding him hostage here.
- At the Home Club?
- What?
No!
At this warehouse.
I gotta get going to rescue him.
- Oh, you'll be careful?
- Course I... will.
I... will, uh...
I guess I'd better be on my way.
I promised Nordberg we'd bake a raisin nutbread tonight.
Oh, I can't fight it any more!
I ran away from you once.
I can't do it again.
Will you stay with me?
Please?
Frank, I'm tellin' you, we've got no business doing this.
All we've got is some dock pass and your hunch.
Please, mark my words, Ed, that Hapsburg is up to something right up to his pretty, imported shirt collar.
Couldn't have picked a better day for it.
This fog'll keep us concealed all the way over to Hapsburg's warehouse.
That's not fog, Frank.
The number two engine's on fire.
They're tryin' to put it out.
All right, let's run through this one more time.
At exactly 3:15, Nordberg will cut the power lines, knocking out the alarms.
Yeah.
Right.
- Nordberg!
- Yeah, got it.
I'll be in the van waiting for your signal.
Are you all wired up?
Yeah.
Right.
And when you hear me say "I love it", you guys move in.
- Check.
- Ready, Frank?
The water's over there, Frank.
Hexagon Oil commercial number one.
Piloting today's giant oil tankers is a big responsibility.
And that's why here at Hexagon's Tanker Captain Training School, future captains go through a rigorous instruction program.
And through a complicated elimination process, we weed out those less qualified for the day-to-day operation of a half-million-ton single hull super tanker.
Only the best will be allowed to take command of what is essentially a floating ecological time bomb.
Commercial two.
Ah, just the way I like it!
You know, someday, way in the future, the sun may be able to provide all our energy needs.
But right now, it gives us a comfortable feeling to know that our home is being supplied by nuclear power.
Oh, I know what you're thinking, but we're not worried.
Because we know that nuclear energy is safe.
In fact, we kinda think of it as... our friendly neighbor.
But remember, our friend can't exist without huge government subsidies.
So, write your congressman and tell 'im to keep those government dollars rolling into... nuclear power.
It looks like I'm gonna have to find another way in, Ed.
They got killer guard dogs here.
You read me?
Loud 'n' clear.
Nordberg, how are we doing?
We're at our destination.
Ed, I'm gonna try the roof.
Ed, I'm gonna try it again.
- Okay, Nordberg, cut the power line.
- Right.
Help!
Help!
Come in, Nordberg.
Frank, you better hold on.
We may have a problem here.
Well... it's lieutenant Drebin.
You were supposed to have been killed last night.
Now I think I'm going to enjoy doing it myself.
It'll be slow and painful.
- What's that smell?
- Oh, that would be me.
I have been swimming in raw sewage.
I love it.
I love it!
That's the signal, let's go.
Humbridge, it's stuck.
Give me a hand.
Ed, help me!
Ed!
Search him.
I love it!
He's wired!
Tie him up!
You'll never get away with this, Hapsburg.
- Whatever it is.
- All right, I'll show you.
Let me introduce you to some people.
Course, you know dr.
Meinheimer.
And you've met Earl Hacker.
Why, you son of a... ow!
And then I'd like you to meet the Redmans.
Weekend guests from out of town.
We're going to the Press Club dinner.
Make sure nothing happens to lieutenant Drebin until I come back.
Then...
I want the pleasure of killing you myself.
The pleasure is all mine.
See you after the speech, lieutenant.
- Freeze!
- That's it.
Freeze!
Get away.
Don't move!
Good Lord!
Look at what they did to dr.
Meinheimer.
You okay, dr.
Meinheimer?
That's okay.
Don't try to talk.
I just can't take this any more.
Garbage like you just makes me sick!
- E-Ed...
- Okay?
I'm just John Q. Public now.
It's just you and me.
- Mano a mano.
- Ed...
I'll teach you to pick on a helpless invalid!
All right, all right, he's had enough!
Somebody help the captain.
We've got to get to that Press Club dinner.
- Mr. Sununu.
- Any predictions, Mr. Sununu?
I don't think there'll be any surprises in dr.
Meinheimer's address.
He'll most likely recommend the President continue our policy of oil dependency, and more dollars for subsidising nuclear power, as I've often recommended myself.
We'll have more on the Press Club dinner after this.
Also we'll have an update on the escaped zoo animals.
This is probably the most important evening of my career.
We can't afford any mistakes.
And if you see lieutenant Drebin or any of his Police Squad near these premises,
I want them arrested on sight.
I told Jane to meet us at the hotel's rear entrance.
- Where's that, Frank?
- In the back.
She's gonna unlock the doors at 7:30 sharp.
What about Hapsburg, Frank?
We're just gonna have to hope that she can stay clear of 'im.
Let's go.
Why, Jane!
What are you doing out here?
The party's inside.
Oh, Quentin!
I was... just getting a breath of fresh air.
I grew up on Lake Erie.
There's nothing quite like it.
Well, I'm... quite sure...
But how fortunate to have found you here.
Now you can join me at my table.
Jane!
Something must have happened to Jane.
Hey, Bernardo, you got the keys?
I have a better idea.
Follow me!
Your attention, please.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Thousand points of...
light.
Light, a thousand points of light.
Recession... bad.
Recovery... good.
Yeah, I think I got that.
Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.
Frank, I think we'd better make our move.
You're right, Ed, I'm thinking of something a little more up-tempo, like Guantanamera.
No!
I mean Hacker.
Looks like he's getting ready to make a speech.
Ohh, right, Ed.
I'll intercept Hacker.
You get the doc prepared for his speech.
Ladies and gentlemen...
- Dr. Meinheimer.
- Yes?
- Or should I say...
Hacker?
- Drebin!
Look what he's doing to that man in the wheelchair!
- Can't someone help?
- Yeah.
Come on, guys.
Let's get him!
- Gimme a shot at him!
- Beat up a guy in a wheelchair, huh?
- We'd better get this man some first aid.
- You sit tight, mister.
Thank you.
I'm pleased and honored to be with you tonight on this historic occasion.
Tonight, dr.
Albert Meinheimer, as he looks up to the future, no doubt he's realized how our tremendous dependence on foreign oil has put a stranglehold on our national budget.
So, a lot of cuts have to be made and some people are gonna be hit hard.
But we'll just keep cutting until we have an impact.
And that's the only way we'll be able to move forward.
Now I present to you dr.
Albert S. Meinheimer.
Oh, my God!
He can walk!
He can walk!
It's a miracle!
I can walk!
Get off me, you moron!
Hey, hey, come back here!
Uhh, yes.
I see.
Everything seems to be okay now, so without further ado,
I present to you, once again, the man who needs no introduction, the esteemed dr.
Albert S. Meinheimer.
Hold it!
Hold everything!
- Don't listen to this man.
He's a fraud!
- No!
- And I can prove it!
- What do you think you're doing?
Because the real doctor Meinheimer has a birthmark in the shape of Whistler's Mother right here!
Obviously, a forgery.
We'll see about this!
Drebin!
Hold it!
Frank is right.
There is a fraud in this room, but it's this man!
And he's just given us this signed confession, implicating that man!
No, no, no...
That man.
Quentin Hapsburg.
- They're gone!
- Let's go!
- Let me go!
- The roof.
Come on, Frank, hurry!
Come on!
Tonight, I intend to share with you my report on our need for a national policy based on energy efficiency and clean, renewable energy sources.
Frank, over there!
Frank!
Take cover!
Frank!
Nordberg!
Cover me, I'm going in!
All right.
Where's Hapsburg?
- Where you hit?
- It's not that.
- You're on my groin.
- Oh, sorry.
- All right, now.
Where is he?
- You're too late.
Hapsburg has Plan B in... in... in...
Where?
Where?
All right.
Who else is almost dead?
Okay, now...
- Talk!
- You're too late, Drebin.
- He already said that.
- Where did he leave off?
Uh, "Hapsburg has Plan B in."
Oh, yeah.
Hapsburg has Plan B in...
- in...
- Where?
Where?
Talk, you low-life scum!
Gee, if that's your attitude, forget it!
I'm right here, Drebin.
Drop your gun, lieutenant.
I believe you're inquiring about Plan B.
That's where we detonate a small nuclear device.
Your dr.
Meinheimer can talk all he wants to.
No one's gonna be left alive to hear it.
Detonation sequence activated.
I'm the only one who knows the abort code.
In exactly ten minutes, this building and everyone in it will be reduced to a pile of rubble.
I'll be safely on my helicopter.
By this time tomorrow, I'll be hunting rhino in Botswana.
What do you think of that, Drebin?
Well, you certainly seem to be in touch with your anger.
I don't care what you think, Drebin.
You're not gonna talk your way out of this one.
Go ahead!
Threaten me like you have the American people for so long.
But it's not gonna work this time.
You're part of a dying breed, Hapsburg, like people who can name all 50 states.
The truth hurts, doesn't it, Hapsburg?
Oh, sure, maybe not as much as jumping on a bicycle with the seat missing, but it hurts.
That's as far as you go, Drebin.
Any final requests, lieutenant?
Yes.
Can I have the gun?
Oh, no.
I'm not gonna fall for that one.
Not so fast!
Six minutes to detonation.
All right, now talk!
Give me that abort code.
Okay, okay, I'll talk.
- There's six numbers...
- I'm coming, Frank!
2, 1, 7...
Oops.
Thanks a lot.
- You sure you all right?
- I'm fine.
Are you okay?
I'm fine, but unless we can disarm this computer in under 5 minutes, this whole building is gonna blow.
- Oh, my God!
We gotta warn everyone.
- Yeah, right.
- Jane, you'd better go.
- No, Frank.
I'm staying here, with you.
But Jane...
Frank, if you're going to be blown to bits, I wanna be here with you.
Jane, I promise you, if we ever come out of this alive,
I'll never let my police work interfere with our love again.
Frank.
Frank!
The bomb.
Come on, Nordberg, let's go.
Four minutes to detonation.
What are we gonna do?
Operator's manual.
See what you can find.
Okay, okay.
Let me see here.
Oh, here we go.
"To reset detonation code, first press pound sign."
Per your command, the speed of this sequence has been greatly increased.
Detonation now in two minutes.
So, instead of spending 2.5 billion dollars on research into nuclear waste disposal, the Federal Government, for only 500 million dollars, or the cost of one B-1 bomber, could reduce the price of solar panels by 90%.
As Albert Einstein once said...
Table...
Hey, come on.
Wake up, wake up!
Wake up.
For God's sake.
Wake up for the blow!
Wake up!
Wake up!
I'll get the lights.
Now, to elaborate on point 102...
Here, read this.
It's an emergency.
"His strong, manly hands
"probed every crevice of her silken femininity,
"their undulating bodies writhing in a sensual rhythm
"as he thrust his purple-headed warrior
"into her quivering mound of love pudding."
All right.
Listen up, everyone.
I want you to calmly file towards the exits.
That's it, that's it.
Nobody run.
Just walk... single file...
That's it.
If we just stay calm, no one's gonna be harmed by the huge bomb that's gonna exploding.
It's a cookbook, it's a cookbook!
Twenty seconds to detonation.
- What are you gonna do?
- 15 seconds.
- Hey, it's got my sleeve!
- Oh, no!
10, 9, 8...
- I can't get it.
- Jane, my jacket!
5, 4, 3...
- 2, 1...
- Let's get out!
Frank, look!
You did it!
Thank you, thank you.
Thank you, Mr. President, for those kind words, but... it's all part of the job.
Frank, I'd like you to consider filling a special post I'm gona create.
It may mean long hours, dangerous nights, and being surrounded by some of the scummiest elements in our society.
You want me to be in your cabinet?
No...
No!
I want you to head up a new Federal Bureau of Police Squad.
- That's a great honor, Frank.
- It's what you've always wanted.
Congratulations.
Nice going!
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. President.
Thank you, thank you.
I'm very honored.
This is something I've always dreamed of, but...
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to turn down your offer, Mr. President.
You see, I've learned something this past week about the Earth and about love.
I guess love is like the ozone layer.
You never miss it until it's gone.
Blowing away a fleeing suspect with my 44 Magnum used to be everything to me.
I enjoyed it.
Well, who wouldn't?
But now, I wanna be known as "The Environmental Police Lieutenant".
I want a world where Frank Junior, and all the Frank Juniors, can sit under a shade tree, breathe the air, swim in the ocean, and go into a 7-Eleven without an interpreter.
I want a world where I can eat a sea otter without getting sick.
I want a world where the Democrats will put somebody up there worth voting for.
I may not get there with you, but most of all,
I want a world where I can wake up each morning with this woman, whom I love!
Yikes!
- Frank!
- Jane!
Frank!
Frank!
- Jane, will you marry me?
- Yes, of course I'll marry you!
We love Frank!
We love Frank!
Okay.
One more picture.
Turn around, over here!
Smile!
Help, George!
All right, let's see if I got this straight, now.
Energy efficiency... good.
Drilling in Arctic national wildlife refuge... bad.
Uh, Mr. President, everything okay in there?
Yeah, I'm fine, thanks.
The honourable Allen D. and the former Mrs Eastern.
The honourable William and Mrs Breslow.
The honourable Nelson and Mrs Winnie Mandela.
Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States and Mrs Bush.
Here's everybody on the list, Barb.
Everybody`s here.
Hi, Peter.
They let you out of the office early today.
Jack, glad you could make it.
Hi.
Get rid of the beard.
I don't like that, too liberal.
Hi, Frank.
Trudy.
Hi, Peter.
Glad you could make it.
I like your suit.
Everybody`s here.
Commissioner.
Thank you very much.
Dr Meinheimer, I'm glad you could make it.
I'm looking forward to hearing your speech.
I'm sure it's a wonderful, well thought-out piece of work.
Ah, here she is.
Dear.
Have you met Dr Meinheimer formally?
.
Thank you.
Great Lady down!
Repeat, Great Lady down!
- What happened?
- Easy, watch the table!
Wait.
- How are you, dear?
.
- l'm OK, I'm fine.
Good.
Please be seated.
Welcome. I'm glad you could all come.
I'm pleased that we have so many distinguished guests tonight.
This week we are celebrating
Law Enforcement Week all across the country.
So I'd like to turn the proceedings over to our own Washington DC Police Commissioner,
Captain Annabelle Brumford.
I would like to introduce a most distinguished American.
This week he is being honoured for his 1 ,000th drug dealer killed.
Please welcome Lieutenant Frank Drebin of Police Squad.
In all honesty, the last two I backed over with my car.
Luckily, they were drug dealers.
- Good.
- Excellent!
Thank you, Commissioner Brumford.
Now I'd like to call on my Chief of Staff, Mr John Sununu, to introduce some special guests.
Thank you.
Mr President, tonight I'm extremely proud to welcome our guests from the nation's energy suppliers.
First, representing the oil industry, head of the Society of Petroleum Industry Leaders, better known as SPlL,
Mr Terence Baggett.
From the coal industry, Chairman of the Society for More Coal Energy, or SMOKE, Mr Donald Fenzwick.
Thank you.
From the nuclear industry,
President of the Key Atomic Benefits Office Of Mankind, KABOOM,
Mr Arthur Dunwell.
As you know, for the past three years, this administration has been trying to formulate a National Energy Policy that will have a lasting impact on the way we live for the next decade and beyond.
To make sure that we choose the right path, the President has appointed as his top advisor in this area,
Dr Albert S. Meinheimer.
As I'm sure you're aware, his reputation in this field is without peer, and Dr Meinheimer will present his recommendations to the Annual National Press Club Dinner this Tuesday evening.
Mr President.
I want all of you here to be the first to know that I've decided to base my administration's entire energy policy on Dr Meinheimer`s recommendations.
This issue is too important to be left to politicians or special interests to decide.
We need an independent and informed source on which to base future actions, and Dr Meinheimer is the recognised expert in this field.
Mr President, if I may say so, I do hope that Dr Meinheimer won't be influenced...
..influenced by any of the so-called environmental groups.
Well, we're all aware of Dr Meinheimer`s reputation.
He is best qualified to explain his research methods.
- Dr Meinheimer.
- Great Lady down again.
This happens every fucking time when I go shopping!
- Jane...
- Dr Meinheimer.
- You're back early.
- And you're here late.
Surely, a lovely woman like you can think of something better to do on a Saturday night?
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to be so blunt.
It's all right, Doctor. it's OK.
You're thinking about him again, aren't you?
What was his name?
- Frank?
.
- Yes.
You just can't forget about him?
- Who?
- Frank.
Oh, yes!
No, I can't. I...
I try.
It's just that when you've had that much man...
But then, you wouldn't understand.
Jane, you mustn't be so hard on yourself.
You've done a wonderful job here at the Institute.
You're the finest Director of Public Relations we've ever had.
Thank you, Doctor, I try my best.
But I see you here night after night past ten.
You must forget about the past.
Go out, see new people, enjoy yourself.
There is someone I'm seeing, in fact just yesterday.
I was telling him about the speech...
- Good evening.
- Hello, Norm.
I forgot.
How was the White House dinner?
.
Extraordinary.
The President promised to implement my recommendations.
Wonderful!
Then you're going to deliver the speech you told me about?
Every word of it.
I would've given it tonight, but a guest there made such a ruckus that they wouldn't have heard me.
Hey, Al!
Ken!
Look at this.
I found this in the waste-basket.
Hey, that's a pretty nice clock!
I wonder why they threw it out.
It's probably because it's four minutes too slow.
Let me fix it.
There.
My name is Sergeant Frank Drebin, Detective Lieutenant, Police Squad.
I was getting my car washed when I heard the call come over the scanner.
There had been a bombing and I was on my way to advise the DC Police as part of the President`s "Operation Scum Roundup".
- Ready?
.
- Yeah, got it.
As far as police work is concerned, once in a while something comes up that nothing quite prepares you for.
Somehow, a demented madman, probably full of self-hate, and possibly a couple of months behind in his rent, finally snapped.
- l'm glad you could make it.
- l got here as quickly as I could.
Congratulations, I understand that Edna's pregnant again.
- Yes, and if I catch the guy who did it...
- Captain.
They`ve searched the building.
No sign of a break-in, no money missing.
This was one hell of an explosion.
We're still trying to figure out what they used.
- Any other victims?
- You're standing on one right now.
- Oh, I see...
- Get him out of here.
- This one's a real mess.
- Over here, Frank found another one.
- Any witnesses, Ed?
- Well, there's one.
A woman.
She saw a man leaving just before the explosion.
- We should let Nordberg handle it.
- No, I'd better do it while it's still fresh.
Not now.
She fainted dead away.
She took a knock on the head.
She looks pretty bad.
- l'll handle it.
- Sir...
- Miss, I'd like to ask some questions.
- Not that bad.
She's being questioned by our sketch artist.
I couldn`t believe it was her.
It was like a dream.
But there she was, just like I remembered her.
That delicately beautiful face... ..and a body that could melt a cheese sandwich from across the room.
And breasts that seem to say, "Hey, look at these!"
She made you drop to your knees and thank God that you were a man.
Yeah...
She reminded me of my mother, all right.
No doubt about it.
Snap out of it.
You're looking at her like she was your mother.
- Frank.
- Jane. I didn't know you lived here.
I moved here two years ago.
- How are the children?
- We didn't have any children.
Yes, of course.
- How was your prostate operation?
- Fine.
As good as new.
In fact, better than ever.
Look, Frank... I know it's awkward, but you're not still obsessed with our relationship, are you?
Obsessed?
Who's obsessed?
Because you backed out of the wedding two years ago?
I'd forgotten.
Ancient history, like the Democratic Party.
He was in tears.
In church, crying like a baby.
- Get a hold of yourself!
- l had to return 13 Cuisinarts.
- That's enough.
- l kept the salad shooter, though.
Jane, there you are.
Hello, Jane.
Dr Meinheimer.
Frank, this is Dr Albert Meinheimer.
- Don't get up.
Nice to meet you.
- Likewise, I'm sure.
I believe we met at the White House dinner.
He never forgets a face.
He has a photographic memory.
It's a terrible thing that's happened.
I hope you find the people responsible.
I'm sorry I can't be more optimistic, but we have a long road ahead of us.
It's like sex, a painstaking task that seems to go on and on forever, and when you think that things are going your way, nothing happens.
Jane, about this man you saw last night...
Anything can help.
I gave the sketch artist a description.
Eh...
Ed!
That'll be all, McTigue.
We should get that other artist.
The one that never dates and lives with two guys.
Right.
Sorenson!
I'd like to see the rest of the Institute, if you don't mind?
Of course.
We should start with the research area.
That's a good idea. lt's right this way.
What can you tell me about the man you saw last night?
- He's Caucasian.
- Caucasian?
Yeah.
You know, white guy.
With a moustache, about 6 foot 3.
An awfully big moustache.
What's this all about?
This is our research laboratory.
Experiments are temperature-controlled by the machinery below.
Our scientists have spent years on them and are just now making breakthroughs.
Today, we'll join two compounds...
Oh, my God!
Thank heavens the bomb didn't damage the research area.
Yes, but I can't understand who'd do such a thing.
Jane, I think you ought to know something.
- Jane, darling!
- Quentin!
Jane, are you all right?
I was so worried about you.
I'm really OK, but I'm glad you're here.
I'm sorry!
Frank, this is Quentin Hapsburg of the Hexagon Oil Company.
- Pleased to meet you, Mr...
- Drebin.
Frank Drebin.
I believe I've used some of your restrooms.
I'm... sure you have.
- Are you connected with the Institute?
- Not officially.
But Jane and I have seen quite a lot of each other lately.
How is my little hell-cat?
Well, that's great. I've been dating, too.
Nice girl, an author.
Wrote the book on male sexual dysfunction.
You've probably read it.
- l beg your pardon?
- Please... I'm sure we can handle the situation maturely, just like the responsible adults that we are.
Isn't that right, Mr Poopy Pants?
- That does it!
- Frank!
Quentin, maybe you should excuse us.
Anything you wish, my darling.
Until tonight, then... l`m feeling blue
Just thinking of you I get out of bed
Wish I was dead
And I hope you do, too
So l`ve given up l`ve thrown in the towel l`ve taken all the pills
The law will allow
And so l`m feeling blue
- Sir?
.
- Give me the strongest thing you've got.
- On second thoughts, a Black Russian.
- Very well, sir.
I guess l`mjust
Screwed
Frank. I thought I'd find you here.
Ed, sit down.
Pull up a memory or two.
You left before I could talk to you.
is it just my imagination or is the whole world crazy?
.
No, it's just a small percentage of the population, Frank.
I hope you're right. lt's just that I don't know if I fit in any more.
You're still thinking about Jane, aren't you?
She's part of my life, Ed.
Always will be.
I think about her constantly.
But it's done.
When she said, "Get out of my life forever," l knew it was over.
Sometimes I think about you and Edna, and I envy you, because you've had the same person every day for over 30 years.
You wake up with her, eat with her, sleep with her...
You make love to the same woman.
You spend every possible waking moment together, while I'm out with 20-year-olds who just want to have fun and cheap sex.
Girls who can't say no, who can't get enough.
"More, more, more!
It's your turn now to wear the handcuffs."
I just want to love, Ed.
I'm sure you'll find love.
- l already have one.
- lt's from the lady.
Go to her, Frank.
Go on!
I'll see you in the morning.
- Excuse me.
- Pardon me.
Sorry.
This isn't easy to say.
I'm lonely, I'm lost.
I need someone to hold, to love.
Frank!
Over here.
Well...
- What are you doing here?
- l called your hotel, got no answer.
Then I tried the station house.
I thought maybe you'd be here.
- Good evening, Sam.
- Mr Drebin.
Jane.
Always nice to see nice people.
Sam, play our song.
Just one more time.
Of course.
Ding dong, the witch is dead Which old witch?
The wicked witch...
Sam.
That's enough.
Play the other one, please.
You can't let old hurts die, can you?
You walk out of my life, no explanation...
- Didn't you get the letters?
- Every one of them.
I didn't open them.
I tore them up and threw them in the fire.
So you didn't get the cheque for $75,000 that your uncle left you in his will?
Why are you here?
I remembered something about the crime.
Outside the window, I saw a red van parked across the street.
Red van?
Thank you, that'll be very helpful.
You've said your piece, you can go now, right?
That's not my only reason for being here.
- l want us to be friends.
- Sure, friends... I bet if I dusted you for prints, they`d be your lover Quentin's.
You...!
I see a certain kitten still knows how to scratch.
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have done that.
We're no good together.
All you ever lived for was police work.
You were always busy saving the "end zone" layer.
Ozone layer!
Frank, you never tried to understand.
How can you say that, when I sank every penny into buying 1 ,000 acres of Brazilian rainforest.
Then I had it slashed so we could build our dream house.
Frank!
How could you be so insensitive?
insensitive?
You think it's easy displacing an entire tribe?
- You try it sometime.
- l'd better go.
This was a mistake.
I don't know why I came here.
I was hoping that you'd have someone.
I'm single. I love being single!
I haven't had this much sex since I was a boy scout leader!
I mean, at the time, I was dating a lot.
- l told you the bombing wouldn't work.
- We had no choice.
Look at this headline.
"President to give Meinheimer blank cheque at Press Club Dinner."
That speech is in two days.
- Don't you think I know that?
- We all know that.
Gentlemen, gentlemen... I know that you're all worried, and I agree.
There's plenty to be worried about.
Like this solar power plant, already operational outside Los Angeles.
Photovoltaic cells.
They convert sunlight directly into electricity.
Fluorescents.
Last ten times as long as a conventional light-bulb.
Uses only a quarter of the power.
Superwindows.
They insulate as well as ten sheets of glass.
An electric car, partially powered by solar panels.
But the truth is, gentlemen, that I'm not worried about any of these things.
Because no one is ever going to know about them.
- What about Meinheimer and his report?
- He's going to tell the President.
Good question.
Why don't we just ask him?
- That's kidnapping!
- Good heavens!
- What about his speech on Tuesday?
.
- Dr Meinheimer will deliver his speech.
It is my view that we must rely on coal, oil and nuclear energy.
Our Dr Meinheimer.
- Oh, my God!
- That's incredible!
Meet Earl Hacker, former arts consultant to Jesse Helms.
As I explained to Mr Hapsburg, my fee is one million dollars, and, might I add, I'm worth every penny of it.
But you gentlemen don't have any choice.
Do you?
After a good night`s sleep, I headed back to police headquarters.
I figured that if I buried myself in police work, I could forget about Jane and maybe in the process catch a vicious killer before he struck again.
So far we had few clues and no real leads.
I was hoping that the lab boys had come up with something.
Shut it off!
- Take it easy.
- Say your prayers.
- Nice work.
- What?
Can you show us the results from the Research lnstitute?
We weren't able to get any clean fingerprints, but we did find footprints outside the Institute.
We made plaster casts of them.
A size 9 1/2 D.
We're running a trace on it.
But more interesting...
We also found this dinosaur footprint.
- A major find from the palaeolithic era.
- Anything else?
Yes, 20 feet down we discovered ancient timbers from Noah's Ark.
About the case... I'll be leaving for Boston tomorrow where l'll deliver a major address to the American Archaeological Society.
And I'm booked on Geraldo next week.
You're going on Geraldo because of this?
No, my wife is a transsexual Satan worshipper.
Meanwhile, we'll be continuing fingerprint analysis, fibre checks, DNA breakdown and hair samples.
Then, using the microscopic dirt particles on this footprint, we'll get a geological breakdown of the entire city.
- We may not have that kind of time.
- Then maybe this will help.
We found this wallet on the curb outside the Institute.
We haven't examined it thoroughly.
It just came down from the lab.
"Hector Savage".
From Detroit.
I remember this pug.
Ex-boxer.
His real name was Joey Chicago.
Yeah.
He fought under the name of Kid Minneapolis.
I saw Kid Minneapolis fight once, in Cincinnati.
No, that's Kid New York.
He fought out of Philly.
He was killed in the ring in Houston by Tex Colorado.
- The Arizona Assassin.
- Yeah, from Dakota.
- Was it North or South?
- North.
South Dakota was his brother.
From West Virginia.
You sure know your boxing.
All I know is:
never bet on the white guy.
- You've got an address?
- The card says, "Monique DeCarlo".
"210 Bleckman Street."
That's the red-light district. I wonder why Savage is hanging out down there.
Sex, Frank?
.
No, not right now, Ed.
We've got work to do.
The address we had for DeCarlo was in the city`s Little Italy.
We went there, hoping it would lead us to Hector Savage and lead us to a clue that would break the case wide open.
That's the cops.
You've got to get rid of them.
All right, I'll handle it.
Quick, hide in the basement.
You'll be safe down there.
- Ed.
- Frank.
- Red van.
- Yes, I know.
Jane said that she saw a red van outside the Institute before the explosion.
- Let's take him down.
- No, he's not working alone.
- Bug the van.
See where it goes.
- Good thinking.
- Nordberg!
- No problem.
Lieutenant Frank Drebin, Police Squad.
This is my Captain, Ed Hocken.
- ls this some kind of bust?
- lt's very impressive, yes...
But we need to ask you a few questions.
Listen.
We're looking for Hector Savage.
Where is he?
Why should I tell you?
Because I'm the last line of defence between sleaze like this and the decent people in this town.
Hi, Frank.
We got that D-83 Swedish Sure-Grip Suck Machine you ordered.
It's a gift.
Frank, come here.
Quick!
It's Savage.
He's on the move.
What?
Hey!
Hey!
Stop, stop!
I'm a police officer!
Let's go.
But remember, we can't let him spot us.
Pull over!
Nordberg's bugging device is right on the money.
I'm not kidding!
Stop!
Shit!
He's changing direction.
Stop the car.
Oh, no!
- He's getting closer.
- We should see him any minute.
Keep your eyes peeled.
Oh, no!
Look, he's real close now.
Step on it!
Help!
Stop, stop!
Frank, stop!
Stop right now!
I've had it!
I said stop!
Help!
Drebin, Police Squad.
What do we have?
It's a tense situation.
Savage is holed up in that house.
- Says he's got hostages.
- He could be bluffing.
Anything else?
Yeah.
That red van is registered to one Quentin Hapsburg.
Well, it looks like the cows have come home to roost.
How are you doing, trooper?
.
Hey, stop firing!
Hold it!
Stop firing!
Stop firing!
Stop firing!
All right, give me the bullhorn.
This is Frank Drebin, Police Squad.
Throw down your guns and come out with your hands up, or come on out, then throw down your guns, whichever you want.
Remember the two key elements:
One, guns to be thrown down.
Two, come on out.
You just try and take me, Drebin!
I've got more if you want them, copper!
- Looks like he's holding all the cards.
- Not all the cards.
How about it?
You can't drive that tank!
You're not checked-out on it!
Don't worry, Ed!
Just keep him busy.
All right, what do you want?
I want a car out front.
Something fun.
A Porsche.
Then I want a plane ticket to Jamaica.
And I want a nice hotel.
No touristy place.
Something indicative of the people and their culture.
We can't do that.
We're calling your bluff.
Now put your hands on top of your head and come out.
We`ve got you surrounded front and... hey!
Frank, what are you doing?
Where are you going?
Frank!
Frank!
Help!
- Your coat, sir?
.
- Yes, it is.
And I have a receipt to prove it.
- Telephone call, Commissioner.
- Thank you.
Excuse me.
Yes?
He did what?
How many animals escaped?
Oh, my God!
Good evening, Commissioner.
You're looking lovely tonight.
Do you realise that because of you this city is being overrun by baboons?
Well, isn't that the fault of the voters?
Excuse me.
Thank you all for attending this event in honour of Dr Meinheimer, who tomorrow will make his historic address.
Along with the President, I pledge to support his recommendations, whatever they may be.
And now, please enjoy the evening.
I'll see you later.
May I cut in?
- What are you doing here?
- l enjoy a good party.
- Why are you really here?
- l can sum that up in three words:
"Quentin Hapsburg." l never liked him from the moment I laid eyes on him.
The man is as dirty as a coalminer`s underwear in January.
What's gotten into you?
He's a kind, gentle, concerned man, who cares about people and is not as suspicious as some people I know.
Ask him what his connection is with the van you saw the night of the explosion.
I don't know what you're talking about.
Ask him if he's pals with a two-bit goon named Hector Savage.
Stop it!
You're just jealous because another man can give me the understanding that you never could.
I just hope Quentin is watching right now, because he'll be jealous.
And a jealous man always makes the wrong move.
I'm counting on that!
Mr Drebin, Mr Hapsburg would like you to join him at his table.
- Solitaire is a lonely man's game.
- Lieutenant!
I don't recall seeing your name on the guest list.
Nothing to be embarrassed about.
I sometimes go by my maiden name.
Nice party.
I see a lot of familiar face-lifts.
- Do you gamble, Lieutenant?
- Every time I order out.
Que sera, sera...
- You do speak French, don't you?
- Unfortunately, no.
But I do kiss that way.
Excuse me!
You happen to be standing in my place.
Dr Meinheimer, you remember Frank?
.
- Uh...
Mister...
- Drebin, from Police Squad.
- You met him at the Institute.
- Yes, of course!
Do sit down.
Thank you, I don't intend to stay.
Let's play another game.
Who's this?
- l wouldn't know.
- He's been a bad boy.
He blew up a building and is driving a van registered in your name.
We own lots of vans.
One of them was stolen three days ago.
Look, Lieutenant, I have nothing to hide.
Maybe, but I'm warning you.
If you so much as sneeze, I'll be there to wipe your nose.
Ladies and gentlemen, it's time for the first door prize of the evening:
an all-expense-paid trip to the Gilligan Islands.
And to draw the first winner, we would like to ask our guest of honour:
Dr Albert S. Meinheimer.
- Let me help you.
- That won't be necessary.
I don't understand what's gotten into Frank.
I'm afraid it's merely a case of jealousy, my dear.
You're going to wear all my gears down.
We shouldn't push it like this.
- He gets around marvellously.
- He does.
- Frank?
.
- Jane.
I just wanted to tell you that I'm sorry about what happened tonight.
- Oh, Frank.
- l need to talk to you.
May I come in?
OK, but the place is kind of a mess.
I was about to make a protein shake.
Do you want some?
No, thank you.
Are you sure?
I'm trying out a new recipe tonight.
Do you know what Dr Meinheimer will say at the dinner tomorrow?
.
Yes, he'll endorse energy efficiency and renewable energy like solar power.
- Who else knew that?
- Only me.
And I told Quentin.
And if the President adopts a policy of supporting efficiency and solar energy, who would be the biggest losers?
Coal, oil and nuclear.
- Frank!
Frank!
- Just one more question.
You told me that Dr Meinheimer had a photographic memory, yet tonight he never recalled meeting me.
That's strange, but he has been under a lot of stress lately.
Does he have any identifying marks?
A scar, a mole, a tattoo, webbed toes or a third nostril?
He has a birthmark in the shape of Whistler`s Mother on his right buttock.
I see...
Have you noticed anything different about him?
Only that he is a foot taller and seems to be left-handed now.
Frank!
What are you trying to tell me?
That Quentin has found a double for Dr Meinheimer and that he will give a fraudulent report to the President?
That's brilliant.
That's a lot better than what I had come up with.
Stop it, this is preposterous!
is there no end to yourjealousy?
.
Jane, you're hurting me.
- What more do you want from me?
- Can I use your phone?
- Local call?
- Yes.
If you'll excuse me, I have to take my shower.
The phone is in the other room.
You can let yourself out.
Goodbye.
Give me Captain Ed Hocken, please.
Ed, I'm onto something big.
I'll need you and Nordberg tomorrow.
What is he doing in Detroit?
Send him the plane fare and a new pair of pants.
Of the way we were
Memories
Like the colours of my mind
Misty water-coloured memories
Of the way we were
Scattered pictures
Of the smiles we left behind
Smiles we gave to one another
Of the way we were
Can it be that it was all so simple then
Or has time rewritten...
Frank!
Just as I suspected.
Come on, on your feet.
Jane...
What happened to the water pressure?
Jane!
Frank!
I was so frightened!
- What happened out there?
- lt's nothing to worry about.
But if I were you, I wouldn't leave until they shampoo the carpets.
- Who would want to kill you?
- Before tonight, only the cable company.
Now I'm afraid it's one of Hapsburg's goons.
He was carrying this.
Oh, Frank!
I feel like such a fool.
- l should never have doubted you.
- There, there...
You couldn't know that the man you were dating was a murdering sociopath.
Oh, Frank!
We have to help Dr Meinheimer.
- He's in danger.
- Yes.
They`ll probably torture him, then kill him.
It's all my fault!
They`ll start by tearing out his toenails and then move on to the nosehairs.
Oh, no!
What are we going to do?
If my hunch is right, they`re holding him hostage here.
- At the Home Club?
- What?
No!
At this warehouse.
I've got to get going to rescue him.
- You'll be careful?
- Of course I will.
I will... I guess I'd better be on my way.
I promised Nordberg we'd bake a raisin nutbread tonight.
I can't fight it any more!
I ran away from you once. I can't do it again.
Will you stay with me?
Please?
Frank, we've got no business doing this.
We've only got a dock pass and your hunch.
Hapsburg is up to something right up to his pretty, imported shirt collar.
It's a perfect day.
This fog'll keep us concealed to Hapsburg's warehouse.
That's not fog.
The number two engine's on fire.
They`re putting it out.
Let's run through this one more time.
At 3:15, Nordberg will cut the power lines, knocking out the alarms.
Yeah.
Right.
- Nordberg.
- Got it.
I'll be in the van waiting for your signal.
Are you wired-up?
Yeah.
Right.
When you hear me say, "l love it", you guys move in.
- Check.
- Ready, Frank?
.
The water`s over there.
Hexagon oil commercial number one.
Piloting today`s giant oil tankers is a big responsibility.
That`s why here at Hexagon`s Tanker Captain Training School, future captains go through a rigorous instruction programme.
Through a complicated elimination process, we weed out those less qualified for the day-to-day operation of a 500,000-tonne single hull super tanker.
Only the best will take command of what is essentially a floating ecological time bomb.
Commercial two.
Just the way I like it!
Some day, way into the future, the sun may be able to provide for all our energy needs.
But right now, it gives us a comfortable feeling to know that our home is being supplied by nuclear power.
I know what you`re thinking, but we`re not worried.
We know that nuclear energy is safe.
In fact, we think of it as our friendly neighbour.
But remember, our friend can`t exist without huge government subsidies.
So tell your congressman to keep those government dollars rolling into nuclear power.
I'll have to find another way in, Ed.
They`ve got killer guard dogs here.
Do you read me?
Loud and clear.
Nordberg, how are we doing?
We're at our destination.
Ed, I'm going to try the roof.
l`m going to try it again.
- Cut the power line.
- Right.
Help!
Come in, Nordberg.
Frank, hold on.
We have a problem.
Well...
It's Lieutenant Drebin.
You were supposed to have been killed last night.
But now I think I'm going to enjoy doing it myself.
It'll be slow and painful.
- What's that smell?
- That would be me.
I have been swimming in raw sewage.
I love it.
I love it!
That's the signal, let's go.
It's stuck.
Give me a hand.
Ed, help me!
Ed!
Search him.
I love it!
He's wired!
Tie him up!
You'll never get away with this, Hapsburg.
- Whatever it is...
- All right, I'll show you.
Let me introduce you to some people.
Of course, you know Dr Meinheimer.
And you've met Earl Hacker.
Why you son of a...
And then I'd like you to meet the Redmans.
Weekend guests from out of town.
We're going to the Press Club Dinner.
Make sure nothing happens to Drebin until I come back.
Then I want the pleasure of killing you myself.
The pleasure is all mine.
See you after the speech, Lieutenant.
- Freeze!
- That's it.
Freeze!
Don't move!
Good Lord!
Look at what they did to Dr Meinheimer.
Are you OK, Dr Meinheimer?
.
That's OK.
Don't try to talk.
I just can't take this any more.
Garbage like you just makes me sick!
- Ed...
- OK?
.
I'm just John Q. Public now.
It's just you and me.
- Mano a mano.
- Ed... I'll teach you to pick on a helpless invalid!
All right, he's had enough!
Somebody help the Captain.
We've got to get to that dinner.
Any predictions, Mr Sununu?
There won't be any surprises in Dr Meinheimer`s address.
He'll recommend that the President continues our policy of oil dependency, and more dollars for subsidising nuclear power, as I've recommended myself.
We'll have more on the dinner later and an update on the escaped zoo animals.
This is the most important evening of my career.
We can't afford mistakes.
If you see Drebin or any Police Squad near these premises, I want them arrested on sight.
I told Jane to meet us at the hotel's rear entrance.
- Where's that?
- ln the back.
She'll unlock the doors at 7:30.
- What about Hapsburg?
- Hopefully, she can stay clear of him.
Let's go.
Why, Jane!
What are you doing out here?
The party`s inside.
Quentin!
I was just getting a breath of fresh air.
I grew up on Lake Erie.
There's nothing quite like it.
Well, I'm quite sure...
But how fortunate to have found you.
Now you can join me at my table.
Jane!
Something must have happened to Jane.
Bernardo, you've got the keys?
I have a better idea.
Follow me!
Your attention, please.
Ladies and gentlemen.
Thousand points of...
light.
Light, a thousand points of light.
Recession... bad.
Recovery... good.
Yeah, I think I've got that.
Ladies and gentlemen, the President of the United States.
Bésame
Bésame mucho...
Each time I cling to your kiss I hear music divine
Bésame mucho
Hold me, my darling, and say that you`ll always be mine
We'd better make our move.
Yeah, I'm thinking about something more up-tempo, like Guantanamera.
No, I mean Hacker!
He's getting ready to make a speech.
Right!
I'll intercept Hacker.
You get the doctor prepared for his speech.
Bravo!
Encore!
Ladies and gentlemen...
- Dr Meinheimer.
- Yes?
- Or should I say Hacker?
.
- Drebin!
Look what he's doing to that man in the wheelchair!
- Can't someone help?
- Come on, guys.
Let's get him!
- Give me a shot at him!
- Beating a guy in a wheelchair, huh?
- We'd better get this man first aid.
- Sit tight, mister.
Thank you.
I'm pleased and honoured to be with you tonight on this historic occasion.
Tonight, Dr Meinheimer, as he looks up to the future, no doubt realises how our dependence on foreign oil has put a stranglehold on the budget.
A lot of cuts will have to be made and some people will be hit hard.
But we'll just keep cutting until we have an impact.
That's the only way we'll be able to move forward.
Now I present to you Dr Albert S. Meinheimer.
Oh, my God!
He can walk!
He can walk!
It's a miracle!
I can walk!
Get off me, you moron!
Hey, come back here!
Everything seems to be OK now, so without further ado, I present to you, once again, the man who needs no introduction, the esteemed Dr Albert S. Meinheimer.
Hold it!
Hold everything!
- Don't listen to him.
He's a fraud!
- No!
- l can prove it!
- What are you doing?
The real doctor has a birthmark in the shape of Whistler`s Mother right here!
Obviously a forgery.
We'll see about this!
Drebin!
Hold it!
Frank is right.
There is a fraud in this room, but it's this man!
And he's just given us this signed confession, implicating that man!
No, no, no...
That man
- Quentin Hapsburg.
- They`re gone!
- Let's go!
- Let me go!
- The roof.
Come on, Frank, hurry!
Come on!
Tonight, I intend to share with you my report on our need for a national policy based on energy efficiency and clean, renewable energy sources.
Over there!
Frank!
Take cover!
Nordberg!
Cover me, I'm going in!
All right.
Where's Hapsburg?
- Where are you hit?
- lt's not that.
- You're on my groin.
- Oh, sorry.
- Where is he?
- You're too late.
Hapsburg has Plan B in... ..in... in...
Where, where?
All right.
Who else is almost dead?
OK, now...
- Talk!
- You're too late, Drebin.
- He already said that.
- Where did he leave off?
"Hapsburg has Plan B in..."
Oh, yeah.
Hapsburg has Plan B in...
- ..in...
- Where?
Where?
Talk, you low-life scum!
Gee, if that's your attitude, forget it!
I'm right here, Drebin.
Drop your gun, Lieutenant.
I believe you're inquiring about Plan B.
That's where we detonate a small nuclear device.
Your Dr Meinheimer can talk all he wants.
No one will be left alive to hear it.
Detonation sequence activated.
I'm the only one who knows the abort code.
In ten minutes, this building and everyone in it will be reduced to a pile of rubble.
I'll be safely on my helicopter.
By this time tomorrow, I'll be hunting rhino in Botswana.
What do you think of that?
You certainly seem to be in touch with your anger.
I don't care what you think.
You won't talk your way out of this.
Go ahead!
Threaten me like you have the American people for so long.
But it won't work this time.
You're part of a dying breed, like people who can name all 50 states.
The truth hurts, doesn't it?
Maybe not as much as jumping on a bicycle with the seat missing, but it hurts.
That's as far as you go, Drebin.
Any final requests, Lieutenant?
Yes.
Can I have the gun?
Oh, no. I'm not going to fall for that one.
Not so fast!
Six minutes to detonation.
- All right, talk!
Give me that abort code.
- OK, I'll talk.
- Six numbers - 2, 1 , 7...
- l'm coming, Frank!
Thanks a lot.
- Are you all right?
- l'm fine.
Are you OK?
.
Yes, but unless we can disarm this computer, the building will blow.
We must warn everyone.
- Jane, you'd better go.
- No, Frank. I'm staying here with you.
But Jane... lf you're going to be blown to bits, I want to be here with you.
Jane, I promise you that if we ever come out of this alive, I'll never let my police work interfere with our love again.
Frank.
Frank!
The bomb.
Let's go, Nordberg.
Four minutes to detonation.
- What are we going to do?
- See what you can find in the manual.
Let me see here... "To reset detonation code, press pound sign."
Per your command, the speed of this sequence has been increased.
Detonation now in two minutes.
So instead of spending 2.5 billion dollars on research into nuclear waste disposal, the Federal Government, for only 500 million dollars, or the cost of one B-1 bomber, could reduce the price of solar panels by 90%.
As Albert Einstein once said...
Wake up, wake up!
Wake up, the place is going to blow!
I'll get the lights.
To elaborate on point 102...
Here, read this. lt's an emergency.
"His strong, manly hands
"probed every crevice of her silken femininity,
"their undulating bodies writhing in a sensual rhythm
"as he thrust his purple-headed warrior
"into her quivering mound of love pudding."
Listen up, everyone. I want you to calmly file towards the exits.
That's it.
Nobody run.
Just walk, single file.
That's it. lf we'll just stay calm, no one will be harmed by the huge bomb that's going to explode.
It's a cookbook, it's a cookbook!
Twenty seconds to detonation.
- What are you going to do?
- 15 seconds.
- lt's got my sleeve!
- Oh, no!
10, 9, 8...
- l can't get it.
- Jane, my jacket!
5, 4, 3...
- ..2, 1...
- Let's get out!
Frank, look!
You did it!
Thank you, Mr President, for those kind words, but it's all part of the job.
Frank, I'd like you to consider filling a special post I'm going to create.
It may mean long hours, dangerous nights, and being surrounded by some of the scummiest elements in our society.
You want me to be in your cabinet?
No...
No!
I want you to head up a new Federal Bureau of Police Squad.
- That's a great honour.
- lt's what you've always wanted.
Congratulations.
Nice going!
- Get in here.
- Thank you, Mr President.
Thank you. I'm very honoured.
This is something I've always dreamt of, but I'll have to turn down your offer.
You see, I've learnt something this past week about the Earth and about love.
I guess love is like the ozone layer.
You never miss it until it's gone.
Blowing away a fleeing suspect with my .44
Magnum used to be everything to me.
I enjoyed it.
Who wouldn't?
But now I want to be known as "The Environmental Police Lieutenant".
I want a world where Frank Junior, and all the Frank Juniors, can sit under a shade tree, breathe the air, swim in the ocean, and go into a 7-Eleven without an interpreter.
I want a world where l can eat a sea otter without getting sick.
I want a world where the Democrats have a candidate worth voting for.
I may not get there with you, but most of all, I want a world where l can wake up each morning with this woman, whom I love!
Yikes!
- Frank!
- Jane!
- Jane, will you marry me?
- Yes, of course I'll marry you!
We love Frank!
We love Frank!
One more picture.
Turn around, over here!
Smile!
Help, George!
All right, let`s see if I got this straight, now.
Energy efficiency... good.
Drilling in Arctic national wildlife refuge... bad.
Mr President, is everything OK in there?
l`m fine, thanks.

Newcastle, Natal, South Africa.
I'm waiting for Eugene Terre Blanche, leader of the AWB, the white supremacist party in South Africa which is preparing itself for war against the blacks.
It had been a fairly frustrating week.
The leader just didn't seem to be interested in meeting us and its press liaison officers said I looked like a Turk and should be put in the coloured section of town.
A major power base for the AWB is the support and help it receives from the army, police and security forces.

Barry, my cameraman was hit to the floor by one of the supporters.
Terre Blanche's driver saw it happening from the stage and out of sympathy offered to arrange an interview for us with the leader.
We drove from Newcastle in the south-east of South Africa to Ventersdorp, a small town in the Transvaal where the leader has his headquarters.
There was a news report that day of 50 AWB members armed with shotguns, knives and pick handles attacking black mine workers returning to the surface.
The AWB are objecting to blacks being employed on certain shifts.
Hello?
Oh, I'm sorry.
Mr Terre Blanche waited for you about a quarter and then he said you would have to make another appointment to see him.
- Mr Blanche came back?
- Yes.
- When should we have a meeting?
- Um...
Um, you'll have to make another appointment, to see him.
Um...
Um, I think you can call Mr Meyer this afternoon.
- Have you got his number?
- I've got his number.
- So I'll try and make another appointment with him?
- Yes, yes, I think so.
Yes.
I'm sorry.
'JP Meyer, the leader's driver, 'lives in this street in the house next to the leader's.
'I learned he'd only come out of prison last week 'because of his involvement with Piet Rudolph,
'South Africa's most wanted white terrorist.'
Why don't we let you get up?
- Just come and have a seat here, I'll be up in a few seconds.
- All right.
- Sorry to wake you.
- That's OK, you're welcome.
Look, shall we come back in half an hour?
Or an hour?
- What time is it now?
- About 4:30.
- Well, I told you four o'clock, man.
- Please come in.
- We'll come back in an hour.
- OK.

Don't photograph me, you bastard!

'We finally agreed to meet the leader 'at a barbecue being given in our honour.
'Johann, one of the town councillors, was host - 'largely, I think, because he was taken by the blonde hair, 'blue eyes and Aryan looks of my assistant, Rita.'
What do you people expect to get here?
I don't know, we're just looking.
No, but you people left home, you climb on the aeroplane, then you travel 14 hours to South Africa.
What did you people expect to get here, eh?
People wearing pants?
Good people.
- So the Queen of England...
- 'JP, the leader's driver, was there too 'only he'd shaved his beard off since we had last seen him.'
And you're my brother, you've got the same colour as what I've got.
- You were made to the image of God.
- What colour?
- White.
Or do you think the image of God is my face or your face?
If you read the Bible, what do you say, what is the image of God?
- Well, tell me.
- It's our colour.
This white uniform that God gave us to wear.
This is the image of God, the white colour.
We are special people.
Even if you don't realise it, you'll realise it in the end.
You might not realise it now but you are part of my people.
- Don't you believe that?
- I don't know, I haven't...
You should come to South Africa more often, man.
I'll convert you.
'There was still no sign of the leader.
'I asked Johann, the town councillor, where he was.'
I don't know.
I really don't know.
'We were making slow progress.
I was asked if I wanted 'to interview the fugitive Piet Rudolph for 5,000 'but I was still no closer to the leader.
'I was reduced to pleading to ride with the leader to his next meeting 'in the hope I could ask a couple of questions on the way.'
- In the car?
- Yeah.
- I told you the leader won't allow it.
He said, no way.
Not a chance.
I just wanted to show you driving and...
There's nothing to driving a car that needs filming.
Is there?
Do we drive differently to the people in your country?
Goodbye.
A report came through from Cape Town of AWB supporters badly beating three young black children and five black schoolteachers as they were leaving a swimming pool.
The AWB has vowed to keep the pool for whites only.
We were on the outskirts of Pretoria when we discovered we weren't going to be able to get our interview with Pete Rudolph.
Good evening.
One of South Africa's most wanted fugitives, right winger Piet Rudolph, has been arrested in Pretoria.
Rudolph, known as "Piet Skiet", was wanted for questioning in connection with the theft of a quantity of arms and ammunition from a defence force base in Pretoria.
Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok said Rudolph had been arrested in Paul Kruger Street in Wonderboom this afternoon.
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
AWB, AWB, AWB!
'People are stunned by Piet Rudolph's arrest.
'The leader recites a poem about the death of the 27,000 Boer women 'and children in the British concentration camps.'

'Now that Piet Rudolph was arrested,
'JP was terrified that he would be put back in prison.
'Piet Rudolph had promised he would kill himself 'rather than testify against his collaborators in the AWB.'
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
- Good morning.
My, but you're early.
- 'This is the driver's wife, Anita.'
- Is JP still here?
- Yes, he's sleeping.
- He's only going to the office a little bit later.
- Oh, I see.
- So he's not going to disappear or anything?
- No, I don't think so.
I hope not so.
Because last night, JP said he thought he might have to...
Yes, he's a bit frightened at the moment and I think he's nervous but I talked to him last night and said he must think properly about things.
About me and the kids staying alone at home and things like that, you know?
So what do you think he'll...?
I don't know.
I think he'll think about it today and then make a decision.
But I can't really decide for him and I can't do anything.
I must take what he's doing.
I'm used to that.
Yeah, because we thought he might be going halfway through the night yesterday.
Oh.
No, no.
Would you like to see him?
He's still in bed.
- You can come and see him.
- He's probably asleep, is he?
- Yes.
- Maybe we should let him sleep.
- Or shall we have a quick look?
- Yeah, just to be sure he is there!
'There was an announcement in the paper that day 'that Piet Rudolph intended to go on hunger strike.'
I'm quite upset because he's the best human being in the whole world.
And...
looks to me like he's going to become the second Bobby Sands, or the South African Bobby Sands, as the newspaper says.
CHILD SPEAKS IN AFRIKAANS
What did you admire so much about him?
His whole personality.
He's not really a criminal, he's just a guy that loves his volk and his country.
Do you think he'll go through with a hunger strike?
Oh, yes, he'll carry through with it.
Definitely.
What will you do if they come to arrest you again?
They won't arrest me again.
I won't allow them, they'll have to kill me.
I'm sleeping with a Luger right next to me.
Would you seriously use it?
Yes, I don't think I'll try seriously to kill somebody but I'll definitely make a lot of noise and force them to shoot me.
That I'd do.
'We were hoping to see the leader later that morning.
'In the meantime, we accompanied Anita, JP's wife, 'who works as a health visitor.'
Somebody's calling us along the road.

Just hold the line.
Condoms.
'Her chief concerns are sterilisation 'and the distribution of condoms.'
THEY CHAT FURTHER
All right.
'That week in Anita's area, they manage to sterilise 60 women.
'We were due to have a meeting with the lead at 11am.
'I had been advised not to ask the leader 'any direct personal questions and to drop or rephrase any questions 'that he took obvious exception to.
'Apparently, he was particularly sensitive about questions 'about his relationship with Jani Allan, the gossip columnist, 'and to reports that week that three members of the AWB executive 'in the Cape had emptied their guns into a black bus,
'killing seven and wounding 20.'
- Hello, good morning.
- Good morning, can I help?
Yes, we've come to do our interview with Mr Terre Blanche.
Oh, he's in a...meeting.
- He's in a meeting?
- Yes.
Oh.
- He didn't leave a message about us coming here?
- No, no.

Yes, but you haven't got any permission to do this, or what?
I thought we were allowed to film outside but we couldn't film inside?

It's a woman who's pretty but is sitting bad.
She looks prettier.
'Johann was trying to talk my assistant Rita into marrying him.
'He and his friend Anton had a special joke for her.'
- Can you understand it?
- What is prettier than a pretty woman?
- I don't know.
- When a pretty woman sits pretty.
- Sits bad, not pretty.
- Oh, bad.
- Ja.
- And she looks prettier.

You see, a woman's a pretty thing.
There's nothing prettier than a woman, only one thing is prettier.

'Finally, we were going to meet the leader.
'We were amongst a group of other journalists and photographers, 'a kind of mini press junket organised by the AWB 'at one of their secret commando training camps way out on the veld.

- How are you people?
- How do you do?
- Fine.
Good to see you again.
Hope you enjoy it.

HE SPEAKS IN AFRIKAANS
'I was beginning to get slightly desperate now.
'We'd been in South Africa for several weeks 'and I was still no closer to an interview 'than the day I'd arrived.

- Ja?
- Do you think maybe we could do an interview with you later today?
My good friend, I said last week you can have an interview with me
- in my office.
- OK.
- So I let you come to this place.
- OK.
- To see all this.
But why, always when I'm busy with my people, I do not have the opportunity to see them many times.
- OK, we...
- This is the first time in two years that I see them so please give me...
Let...
Take the time to see my people

- OK.
- So you go and take all the shots you want here and then we can discuss it in my office.
- OK.
NEWS JINGLE PLAYS
'I wasn't able to see the leader that week 'because he was in Pretoria 'meeting with the Minister of Law and Order, Adriaan Vlok,
- 'about AWB violence.'
- NEWSREADER:
Mr Vlok expressed concern about the breaking up of political meetings and the activities of the AWB's Boer commandos.
Mr Blanche said at a news conference after the meeting that the unruly behaviour of people at National Party meetings was the result of what he called the government's policy of selling out whites to terrorists, and if the government wanted to stop such actions,
it should stop the reform process.
'I had the feeling that Anita didn't like the leader very much.'
Yes, in a sense I like him, but he's also very...dominative.
When he tells you to get up, you must get up.
Now, sometimes I'm stubborn.
If he says to me, "Get up," then I'll sit down.
And he tells me to go and fetch something,
I say...
I'll tell him that I'm busy now.
- It's just, um...a reaction of mine against...
- Maybe it's good for him.
- Pardon?
- Maybe it's good for him.
For the leader?
No, it's not good.
And that's what JP discovered long ago.
It's no use going against him, rather please him and you'll have a much more comfortable man.
When you go against him, he gets more and more aggravated.
But now I can't help myself.
I'm just stubborn when I'm in his company.
'When the leader returned,
'I decided to employ a more direct paparazzi style.'
- Stop.
- OK, sorry.
Sorry.
- When you take photos of me, you have to ask me, OK?
- All right.
Sorry.
Now, you've really upset him.
What?
Just because we...?
I assumed he didn't mind us taking pictures of him.
'We travelled to Upington on the Namibian border.
'A report came through from the Northern Transvaal 'that AWB members armed with sticks and whips 'attacked 300 black children attending Sunday school.
'At the court hearing, the AWB accused received a standing ovation 'and their bail was raised from public donations.'
APPLAUSE AND CHANTING
SPEAKS IN AFRIKAANS
JP speaks of his admiration for Piet Rudolph.
He appeals to the people to give money for Piet and all he stands for.
JP believes that Beweg have found a martyr, a man prepared to starve himself to death for the people and their cause.
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
At the end of the meeting, supporters rush up to sign on as commandos.
AWB already have several thousand commandos, trained in semi-automatic weapons, unarmed combat and explosives.
THEY SPEAK AFRIKAANS
'At the time, I had no idea that the leader was illegally advising 'this man to keep his weapons.'
OK, now.
I suppose you want to ask me a few questions.
Of course, I want to use this little time to talk to my people.
Do you want to ask a few questions?
- We just wanted to film a little.
- But that is not fair.
Because my people do not know that they are on camera in Britain when they are not there to defend themselves.
- Would you like us to stop?
- If I want you to stop?
Well, I think so.
I think this is a private...
It's time when one...
Maybe one or three times per four years I can see my people.
So this is really a private conversation.
I want to chat with my people.
And that is not for broadcasting.
OK.
CHEERING
The one place we did receive a warm welcome was from the kids in the township outside Vanderstoep.
Few of them had ever touched white skin.
Kaffir Cat.
Kaffir Cat.
Kaffir Cat.
Why do you call it Kaffir Cat?
Because it's black.
Blacks are called Kaffirs here.
So Jani wants to call it Blackie or something like that, so I said,
"No.
Every second dog and cat in town that's black are called Blackie."
"Let's be different and call it Kaffir Cat."
So I think it's a marvellous idea.
Tell us, what exactly did JP do with Piet Rudolph?
And why did he go to prison?
What did they want from him?
They thought he knew where Piet Rudolph was.
And he did not know where he stayed.
But he just helped him because Mr Rudolph was his good friend and he was loyal to him.
I mean, I'm also loyal to Mr Rudolph.
He's a good man.
What did JP do with Piet Rudolph?
Now he...
He introduced him to the people who know how to work explosives.
Piet Rudolph and them come to an agreement... to blow up Melrose House.
But JP wasn't pleased.
He had nothing to do with it, really, other than introducing Mr Rudolph to those people.
JP's houseboy is cleaning the BMW with the three sevens number plate.
The Biblical three sevens are the AWB's adopted emblem and insignia.
So, JP, what does the triple seven stand for on the car?
It's a normal registration number.
I thought the triple seven had a significance.
It has a significance.
Don't you think it's beautiful having a registration number like that?
- Explain it to us.
- There's not much to explain.
- You want me to explain the sevens or the registration number?
- The sevens.
Well, the sevens are the sevens of God.
Comes out of the Bible.
Right through the Bible, you read about seven.
God created Earth in seven days.
He created man on the seventh day.
He actually rested on the seventh day, man was created on the sixth day.
We took it as our sign.
It's the antipole of the triple sixes of the Antichrist.
What kinds of people do you think are Antichrists?
Satan and his disciples.
Anybody that works with Satan.
And, of course, the international money power.
They are working in his hand.
Who are "they"?
- Just look around.
Who owns Chase Manhattan Bank?
- Who does?
Well, it's the...
Rothschilds and the Rockefellers.
And the Oppenheimers of the world.
Have you ever read the book called The Illuminati And The CFR Conspiracy?
Do yourself a favour and get hold of that book.
The Terre Blanche interview had developed into some ridiculous kind of game.
We once again arrived for an appointment to find he'd gone to yet another meeting.
At least this time, though, we'd gotten into his office and were able to poke around in some of the leader's memorabilia.
A picture of the leader as a policeman in the South African police force that had been used as a recruiting poster at the time.
Terre Blanche, the poet and writer, whose play in Afrikaans about the Boer people and their struggle against thirst and hunger was compulsory reading in the school syllabus for children in Natal.
Terre Blanche the private man whose nine-year-old daughter is rarely allowed out to play with other children for security reasons.
Portraits of the original Boer generals who fought the British from 1899 to 1902 look on across the room, and almost silently witnessed the destruction of Terre Blanche's political career when he was found on the steps of the Paardekraal Monument with Jani Allan,
a former model turned journalist.
After their first meeting, Jani referred to the leader as Ramboer and wrote, "He doesn't walk into a room, he takes occupation of it.
"Things shrink, the roomscape insidiously rearranges itself
"so that he becomes the focal point.
"He speaks with a rich earth-brown voice, sometimes the texture
"of a newly ploughed field,
"sometimes it's a caress of warm corduroy.
"Right now, I've got to remind myself to breathe.
"I'm impaled on the blue flames of his blowtorch eyes."
Jani Allan left South Africa after a bomb exploded in her apartment.
Johan the town councillor is particularly concerned that black men are starting to have sex with white women.
What about AIDS in this country?
Tell him about AIDS.
- AIDS in this country...
- They've got millions here.
- The blacks...
I've got something in mind.
I've got a paper to show you.
They used it the other day.
There is always 20 or 30, or 120,000 blacks that's got AIDS.
But the next day, I don't know where it came from,
I still want to find out, next week, they talk about 1.5 million who's got AIDS.
- Now.
- Where is apartheid?
- Where is apartheid now?
Since apartheid disappeared, with FW de Klerk,
- we've got all the bloody AIDS.
- We'll die.
- It's unreal, man.
- We'll die.
We will die all of AIDS.
We can't mix.
We can't mix.
Like I tell you one thing, people, the whole world is crying for the blacks.
The next thing is, I'm a Christian, I've got the Bible.
I've got the Bible.
And I believe in my Bible, I read my Bible.
Before the world is going to disappear, through fire,
AIDS is going to take 80% of the world's population.
And 20% of that is going to survive.
I won't say 20%, I'm not sure, I'm not Christ.
I just make a statement to this.
And I can tell you one thing, that few people who's going to be left is going to be Christians, and they're going to start a whole new, decent world, without Mandela and de Klerk.
- Let me tell you that tonight.
- AIDS will help us.
AIDS is going to kill all the kaffirs.
Yeah, we don't want to mix.
We don't want to mix because AIDS will kill all the blacks.
And we're going to survive.
And when we are separate, apartheid was the word, what do you call it?
- We will survive.
- You're going to survive.
- Yeah.
The blacks is going for the white woman now in South Africa.
- And this is where the war's going to start.
- Yeah, I'm telling you.
- This is not Rhodesia.
- I know Rhodesia.
You know what's going to happen here?
Did you ever see bullets fly?
Did you ever see it?
This is what's going to...
I've got three daughters.
One is 15, one is just under 14, one is just under 12.
And I tell you one thing, if a black ever tries to touch my daughter,
I don't care who's in charge of the government, or the police,
I'll shoot the whole lot out.
Fire.
Little.
So, he's going to be a gunmen yet?
I think anybody likes to play with a gun, balance or something like that.
He's just a natural boy.
'A couple of hours later, Yanni shot Terre Blanche's daughter, 'which went down less well.'
WALTZ
'It was the AWB annual dinner, being held at a golf club near Sun City.
'There was trouble down on the Cape, 'and JP had gone out alone to sort things out.
'I asked to go too, but all I got from him was that he was 'going to recruit commandos for the AWB rally on Paul Kruger Day.
'The leader was there with his wife, 'and General DeWitt, an ex-chief of police.
'At the other end of the table was Anita, 'and the leader's nine-year-old daughter.
'They all love Bruce Springsteen.'
# I'm just living in a dump like this
# Something happening somewhere
# Baby, I just know where it is
# I can't start a fire
# I can't start a fire with a broken heart
# This gun's for hire
# Even if we're just dancing in the dark
# Even if we're just dancing in the dark
# Hey, baby
# Even if we're just dancing in the dark. #
'A couple of days later.'
- Oh, hi, JP, it's Nick.
- 'How are you?
'
- I'm fine.
I was just calling up to see if it might be possible to interview the leader today?
'If you just hold on, I'll find out for you.'
'Nick, 12.15.'
'The leader interview saga continued.
'I arrived ten minutes late for a 12.15 appointment 'to discover the leader had left in anger.
'I was told to come back again at 6.30pm.'
Hi.
- We came to try and do an interview.
- For the leader?
- Yeah.
- He left.
Oh, God.
Let's just stop.
Come inside.
I'm glad it's not me
- having an interview with Mr Terre Blanche tonight.
- Why?
You upset him terribly.
We were there waiting half an hour from six to 6.30.
And what about this afternoon?
And this afternoon, we were there at 12.15, and at one o'clock.
HE TALKS AFRIKAANS
'JP and Anita ended up getting caught in the crossfire 'between us and the leader.
'A considerable amount of anger had been directed at JP that day.'
I've had more shit than I could handle today.
So I'm glad it's you having the interview, and not me.
He said, OK, for my part, he's willing to see you at seven o'clock tonight.
At the office.
He'll be there.
I'll take him there.
I'll take you there, too, so as I see that you are all there together.
- But I've had enough now.
- Have you?
- I really have.
I think if he's not happy about being interviewed by someone, it's not going to be a happy occasion, he shouldn't do it.
- Don't you want to do it?
- I want to do it, but I want to do it...
Well, then you better do it on his terms, friend.
Mr Terre Blanche, I'm very sorry that we were ten minutes late.
I'm not making a movie.
I'm not making a film.
I'm preparing my people for a fight.
- Don't do it to me again.
- Well, we won't...
Yes, you won't, because you will have tonight what you're looking for, and then you'll go out.
They'll move out.
So, let's finish it.
And stop it.
Mr Terre Blanche, I'm very sorry that we were ten minutes late.
Oh... (HE MUMBLES)
Stop it.
I'm not accepting your apologising.
You were late.
And I listened to that man, Mr Meyer, he said to you,
"If you are late, no interview!"
Yet you chose to be late.
If I'm not so important that you are on time here, why the hell was it discussed with you, anything?
Where were you?
Where were you, the time when you should be arrived at my place?
Where were you?
Well, I think we were actually five minutes late...
Yes, five minutes is enough, man.
Where were you then at 12.15?
Tell me!
I heard him...
At that stage, I was busy with a meeting, and I hear him say,
"If you are late, stop it."
So I ran from the City Hall to the office, and you were not here.
I was on time, that you were late.
Well, we were then told to come back at one, which we did.
That is not the point, the point is you were late.
Who are so important, that you people were late, tell me?
Well, we then came back at six...
- No, who were so important that you were late?
- We were five minutes late.
Who was so important that you were five minutes late?
Tell me.
Give me the name of the man, he must be a hell of an important man.
- Who was it?
- I think we were just actually, were we getting some tea?
Well, that's good.
Tea and dinner is better than a man.
I thought you used up my time for somebody else.
Well, all we can do is say that we are sorry, we waited a lot today to try and interview you...
You can't do anything, my good friend.
Nothing.
I will always remember it.
This is the heartland.
This is Africa.
And I am a Boer.
And I will never accept that, because I will never do it to you.
With my full programme, I will never, ever do it to you, but yet you did it to me.
What do you want from me?
Well, we wanted to ask you some questions about...
Well, you can ask me questions.
Yes.
- What?
- At what point did you decide that it was a war?
When I, when I choose a time.
When I choose a time, I will decide it will be war.
Are you one of my generals?
No, I'm just asking you when you decided it was a war?
Yes, when I decide, it will be a war, I will choose a time.
Are you one of the officers or one of the generals?
So I will not tell you.
But what I can tell you is we will never accept an ANC government over my people, OK?
Then we will start the war, that day or that night.
But it will be my choice.
And as you are not an officer or general...
I think maybe you misunderstood me, what I meant...
No, I've not misunderstood you.
What I meant was, at what time did you decide you might have to go to war?
When I choose a time.
I'm not misunderstanding you.
I will decide when.
And that is my choice.
What I was meaning, at what point did you decide that AWB needed to be formed, in order to fight a war, if you needed to fight one?
I answered your question already.
That is my choice, my good friend.
'JP said it was the worst interview he had ever witnessed.
'I think he then expected us to go back to England, 'but then instead, we went with him to Carletonville, 'a large mining town just 50 miles away.'
AFRICAN MUSIC
- 'Good evening.
- Welcome to the news at eight.
'Detained Orde Boerevolk leader Piet Rudolph 'has appealed to members and sympathisers 'of the organisation to hand over illegal weapons to the police.
'In a signed statement, he called on members of the Orde Boerevolk 'to return all the illegal weapons, ammunition and explosives.
'Mr Rudolph said he had ended his hunger strike.
'In the statement he also said he was being treated very well.'
'The AWB was shattered by the news that Piet Rudolf had ended 'his hunger strike, and was calling on them to hand in their arms.
'Terre Blanche recited one of his poems for the occasion.'
RECITES IN AFRIKAANS
'JP was terrified and disillusioned 'by what his friend Piet Rudolph had reportedly done.
'There were rumours that he given away the names 'and addresses of his collaborators.
'Rumours that the government now intended to round up 'the white right.
'Rumours that the AWB was infiltrated by the security police, 'who were just waiting for the right time to strike.
'JP was still making his Piet Rudolf speech, 'still talking about him as the hero of the Boer nation.
'JP didn't want to believe what he was hearing on TV, 'he wanted to believe it was a government conspiracy 'to destroy the right, and to corrupt the spirit of the volk.'
SHOUTS IN AFRIKAANS
APPLAUSE AND CHEERING
- No, please, man.
No.
- Please, JP.
- JP...
- Yeah.
Are you kidding us that you're through with AWB, or are you honest?
I'm honest.
Well, what made you decide to stop working for Mr Terre Blanche?
Are you filming me?
- Just be honest, JP.
- Well, I just...
- I just decided to call it a day.
- Why?
- I'm fed up.
- What are you going to do instead?
I'm going to work on the mines.
Come and make yourself at home, I'm just fetching Anita.
But what specifically made you decide to change?
Don't, JP, please, come on.
JP!
HORSE NEIGHS
'The leader, meantime, tends to his favourite horse, 'called Bestorm, which in Afrikaans means, "to charge in battle".
'He plans to ride Bestorm at the head of the AWB rally, 'to be held on Paul Kruger's Day.
'The next day, JP's friends from the AWB come round to try 'to get him to change his mind.'
So how are you going to try and persuade JP...
Oh, we'll discuss this later.
I don't know yet how.
But if he thinks it's the best belief, I won't stand in his way.
He's not going to leave the AWB.
He's only going to leave his job.
- So these are the ingredients for what?
- For teargas.
That's formalin and Condy's crystals.
- And what do you do with it?
- You mix it together, and you get teargas.
- But beautiful teargas.
- No, that's good teargas.
And do you have a lot of uses for it?
Only to break up NP meetings.
That's all we use it for!
LAUGHTER
That's apart from the genuine teargas that we steal from the Army.
Hey!
- And the police.
- You're piss.
Danny, would you like to catch a shot of this?
HE SPEAKS AFRIKAANS
That's teargas.
- Go, JP.
- Bye-bye.
'JP promised that when his friends left, 'he would explain why he resigned, and what he intends to do.
'I still can't tell whether he's going to reveal 'something quite extraordinary, 'or if he's just enjoying the attention of the camera.
'We've been talking to Johann about getting JP a new job 'and a house away from Terre Blanche.
'And I'm hoping, with enough pushing, 'we are about to watch the transformation 'of a white supremacist into a new South African.'
No, I think you're giving us a kind of party line at the moment.
And that you were going through a real dilemma.
And that you felt very disillusioned, both with the leader and with Piet Rudolph.
But I don't think you're prepared to talk about that openly.
Look... (HE CLEARS HIS THROAT)
Yesterday, and the day before yesterday, I promised you that today you could speak to me, and you could ask me anything, and as far as possible, I'd be honest with you.
When you caught me yesterday and the day before yesterday,
I was really at my weakest.
That's why I didn't want to speak to you.
That's why I made a promise to speak to you today.
So, I can't say I think you really, you shouldn't blame me
- for being dishonest with you.
- No, I'm not blaming you,
I understand what you're really thinking.
You see, any person that goes through this type of thing needs a few hours with himself to sort out his thoughts, and I've had the time...
..and as I'm sitting here at the moment, I'm really honest with you.
The things I tell you here, I'm honest, I can promise you that.
That's why I didn't want you to film me yesterday.
- So, what are your feelings about?
- My feelings at the moment,
I've decided to resign, and I'm not sorry about that.
I've resigned from the AWB.
I'm not in their employ any more, but that doesn't stop me from being a member of the AWB as an organisation, and I'll still do my part in the revolution that's coming.
And if all these things they say about Piet Rudolph is true, then we need somebody to take his place.
And if we couldn't find anybody like that, I'm willing to take his place.
I don't think of myself as great a man as Piet Rudolph,
I'm not saying that.
But at least we need somebody to do the job, and if it has to fall on me, I'll have to do it.
- I'm honest with you now.
- What kind of things are you prepared...?
Anything that Piet has done up to this moment.
And anything that might pop up in future,
I don't know what will happen.
Like what?
Just mention what.
One thing I'm quite sure of, I'd pick my targets better.
What kind of targets would you go for?
Up to this stage, or up to the stage that Piet Rudolph was arrested, the Boerevolk hasn't really decided yet to kill people.
And I'm not at this moment saying that I might kill people, but it might just get to that point where we'll have to do that.
What kinds of people would be killed?
Well, the enemies of our volk.
The people that are at the moment they're very busy
- selling out our people.
- Like who?
Well, I can't at the moment think of any names, but if you want to mention names, maybe people like Vlok, and FW and Mandela, all the enemies of our volk.
And even people from outside our country that want to poke their long noses into our affairs.
I'm not sure, I haven't got any targets, but I feel the climate is beginning to be ripe for human life to be taken.
- Hey.
Put it down.
- Switch off.
- Switch off.
All right, see you!
'For once, the leader was playing and joking around with us.
'He had managed to persuade JP, despite his resolution, 'to play the drums at the enormous AWB rally on Paul Kruger Day.
'The leader was hoping 5,000 people would attend 'and he saw it as a message to the world of his strength and support.
'The leader is in the truck, closely tailed by a security vehicle.
'He is carrying his saddle as he plans to ride into the stadium on his favourite horse.
'And in a press statement, he also said 'he would sleep with his horse in the stables the night before.
'We have agreed to carry JP's drums 'and I'm determined to get the shot that has been refused me 'throughout the film, the leader in a vehicle travelling to one of his meetings.'
Left, left, left, left.
MUSIC:
Radetzky March
- Hi, JP.
- Good morning.
- How are you?
- Fine, thank you.
Yourself?
Had a nice rest?
THEY SPEAK AFRIKAANS
Ja.
What is he saying?
He wants to show the State President that they would like their schools to be white.
SHE SPEAKS AFRIKAANS
Ja, he will eat the black when he comes to his school.
- Is that what he said?
- Ja.
- What did the girls say?
CHANTING
Stop it now.
'The 5,000 that the leader had expected didn't show up 'and I heard he was furious.
'I gathered also that his night with his horse in the stables 'hadn't been a great success and part-way through 'he had retreated to the Holiday Inn for more comfortable accommodation.
'To make matters worse, we had shown up late with JP's drum kit 'and the leader blamed us personally for delaying the parade.
'In a particularly animated argument with my assistant Rita, 'he had actually accused us of trying to sabotage the day.'
- Excuse me, Mr Terre Blanche.
- Yes.
- I am sorry about the mix-up.
Listen, my good friend.
This is the last time that one of your people, I don't mind whether it is a woman or not, be cheeky with me, you understand?
This is my country, this is my place, this is my day here.
And last night I said I don't want you people any more here.
This morning you have to speak to me.
And the first thing you do is take photos.
Before you even ask me if you are welcome or not.
I thought this was a parade...
If you, if you people interfere today again like you did yesterday, then you...
I will put you out, you understand me?
Yesterday, when we came from Ventersdorp, you even interfered with security.
You passed my car two times and blocked the traffic so that the head of security cannot even see me.
And you're just taking over.
Who the hell do you think are?
We were just trying to get a passing shot...
Listen, I am not working for your bloody company, OK?
So you do the things which I like, not what you people like.
Can you understand me, lady?
You even interfered with security.
My wife and my child was in that bloody car.
So what do you ask now?
- Well, we just want to take the parade, that was all.
- Yes, but...
These...
See that you are not in the way of the parade itself.
- You can take some photos.
Go on.
But don't interfere.
Please.
- OK.
And this man, I said in Ventersdorp,
I tell you people when you can take shots from us.
But he's like a bloody monkey.
- He's hanging on that camera like a monkey in a bloody tree.
- He is a monkey.
You are a monkey.
He definitely is.
- Hey, monkey, put off that thing.
- OK.
Now you have got something to take to England.
A good argument with me.
That is exactly what you wanted.
No, what we wanted to do was just to film the parade, we wanted to film a passing shot yesterday.
Yesterday?
I explained to the lady yesterday.
- OK.
- All right, Jim.
- Follow me.
SHOUTING AND COMMOTION
DRUMMING
APPLAUSE
- JP.
- Yes.
- How are you doing?
- Fine, thank you.
Just tired.
So how's the leader today?
- Well, I saw him shutting you out.
- Why's that?
Apparently, he just doesn't like your face today.
I just quickly see if I can find my wife.
Because we've only got ten minutes and I've got to be back again.
'A couple of months later, JP opened a small electrical store.
'The leader's attempts at driving himself proved to be disastrous 'when he and the 777 BMW plunged drunkenly into a river.
'A large number of his supporters left the AWB following the incident.'

You know what I think?
I think they did it together.
I mean, they both really hated his guts.
I bet you anything... they were in cahoots from the beginning.
Professor Plum and Mrs. White?
Well, yeah.
Sometimes, they get stuck together.
I once had to pry Colonel Mustard off of Mrs. Peacock's back.
Three cards, O'Connell- location, weapon and murderer.
One murderer.
It's after 10:00.
I gotta go.
I can see every card in your hand.
- So, don't look.
- I can't help it.
How about turning up the heat, O'Connell?
I'm freezing.
Can I wear this?
Oh, I don't think you should.
What?
Rick's gonna mind?
No, it's not his.
So, what's the big deal?
Go, already.
I'm gonna miss my plane.
Well, we both know it's the library.
This is stupid, O'Connell.
You can't play the game of Clue with two people.
It is obviously Colonel Mustard with the candlestick in the library.
Now, can we leave?
Please?
Oh, I don't want you to go.
Stay.
Stay.
Stay.
Give me something really, really stupid.
I don't think we have anything that stupid, Dr. Fleischman.
Well, then give me something really touristy.
How about some willow ptarmigan candies?
It's the state bird, so it's good for tourists.
And it's marzipan, so it's nice and filling.
Great.
I'll take three boxes.
Okay.
One each for your folks, and one for-
Now, isn't that a nice thought?
I wouldn't be surprised if she took you back.
It's not for Elaine.
It's for- Uh-huh.
You know- I have a lot of friends in New York.
Friends from med school, friends from college, friends from-from Bronx Science.
I'm still in touch with Richie Marx.
We had our bar mitzvah together.
It was a Temple Beth Shalom double bill.
Yeah.
He's gonna get us tickets to, uh, Sinead O'Connor.
She's playing the Palladium.
Oh, great.
I don't even know if I can pack it all into two weeks.
When you come right down to it, what's the point of comin' back here at all?
You'll get thrown in the slammer for breach of contract.
Okay.
There's a point.
Morning, Maggie.
Hi.
- Hello, O'Connell.
- Hi.
Your chair's out back.
That's a heavy old thing.
I had to help the guy lug it off the truck.
Thanks, thanks.
just stocking' up for my little trip back to the Big Apple.
I'm goin' bullish on ptarmigans.
Care for a box as a memento?
Bite a ptarmigan's head off, you'll be flooded with memories of me.
Mmm, no, thanks.
Um, I'll just go get the truck.
- You better get Rick to give you a hand.
- Oh, I can't.
He's in the Aleutians.
- I'll give you a hand.
- You will?
Sure.
Why not?
Is this a dirty trick, Fleischman?
What, like a practical joke?
Like, I'm gonna help you with the chair and drop it on your foot?
- Yeah.
- Absolutely not.
Well, thanks, Fleischman.
That's, uh-
That's-That's sweet.
Oh, I appreciate it, I do.
It's just that I have this Pavlovian response to you, and I can never really express my appreciation.
To you, that is, because you're sneaky and duplicitous and self-serving, and I always think you have a hidden agenda.
You're welcome.
Be back in five minutes for the marzipan.
Okay, Joel.
I'll get 'em wrapped up for you.
Trapped as we are on that merry-go-round of time, we've circled around once again to the annual Cicely, Alaska birthday bash extravaganza.
That's right.
Tomorrow's Founder's Day, when we all get together out at the church and mark that special day back in 1932... when Cicely and Roslyn stalled out here on the cusp of the new Alaskan Riviera... and had to make the best of a bad situation.
That's a damn lie.
Now, nobody really knows for sure what happened in that stalled car out in the woods... with Cicely and her very special friend Roslyn.
Damn it!
I told him to lay off that lesbian angle!
All alone, a little homesick, couple of slugs out of Roslyn's hip flask.
One thing leads to another.
Hey, come on.
We've all seen Cicely's picture.
Sure, she's a little heavy-set, on the jowly side, but very attractive in a Margaret Thatcher kind of way.
It's not an angle, Maurice.
Cicely and Roslyn loved each other deeply.
That's why they came to Alaska in the first place.
They couldn't find acceptance in polite Billings society.
Well, why in the hell did they have to find it here?
I've got nothing against Sapphic love.
I've been to some erotic movies myself.
But why hold up Hecate and Persephone and whoever to the rest of the world and say,
"Hey, look, folks.
This is what we're all about"?
You get into areas of attraction, and we're talkin' serious mystery here.
Shh!
This is it.
And while we are talking mystery, the Video Society continues Death and Devastation Month this Wednesday at Ruth-Anne's library.
Tonight's selection, Pile-Up On Highway 10, is on loan from the private collection of Ed.
Well, guess that was my 15 minutes.
Ingrid.!
Is it April already?
Time does fly.
Seems like I just left, doesn't it?
Yeah.
Hi, Ed.
I heard your name on the radio just now.
Oh, thanks!
- You're looking well, Ingrid.
- Well, you're looking good yourself, Maurice.
Your squeeze off on the ice again?
Yeah.
The snowshoe hare population's up eight percent.
Doesn't he freeze out there in just that itty-bitty pup tent?
He doesn't even notice it.
From now until the end of tagging season, he thinks about nothing but hares, hares, hares.
I can dig it.
Such a help.
Watch-Watch the legs.
This way.
This way.
This way.
This way.
Thank you.
What is this thing made of, melted-down anvils?
Oh, great, Fleischman.
My records!
I hope you take better care of your airplane.
They were in alphabetical order.
Very classy, O'Connell.
Cole Porter.
You ever hear Sinead O'Connor sing "You Do Something To Me"?
It's fantastic.
All right, where do you want this thing?
Over there in the corner, please.
Ah, yes.
Under the memorial shrines.
I think scrapbooks are cliché.
Huh.
How many boyfriends have you lost?
Four.
This is definitely original.
No, I'm serious.
Well, I used to have candles, but I worried that they'd burn the dioramas.
A lot of those figurines are crayons.
Crayons?
Yeah, I melt them down, pour them into molds.
Then after they cool off, I put on their little outfits.
Where'd you pick up the plastic sushi?
Sitka.
Harry's is the worst.
I mean, no matter what I do, talcum powder does not look like snow.
But Roy's is good, though.
He loved those California rolls.
Why do they all have these little black polka dots all over them?
Those are the black fedoras.
The black fedoras?
Yeah, symbolizing- Well, you know.
Death?
Right.
And what does the glued-on macaroni symbolize?
Man's inhumanity to man?
Nothing, Fleischman.
They symbolize nothing.
They're macaroni.
What are you gonna do for Rick, a toy plane and a tiny Soloflex machine?
Very amusing.
Now, just put the chair by the sushi.
You're amazing.
Incredible.
Spectacular.
Better than the Buzzer?
I know, I know.
I wouldn't want you to talk about me to them.
Oh, you're the one with the privacy fetish.
No dining out, no strolling through town.
I've got your reputation to protect.
Girl like you, small town like this-
You could be ruined in a week if tongues started wagging.
You're sweet.
Very sweet.
As sweet as Johnno?
Maurice, you're so silly.
Oh, I bet he's great in the sack, huh?
Unimaginative, but very, very dependable.
A missionary man all the way.
Am I right?
What if I don't tell you?
What if I make you?
I've got something that'll break down those defenses.
What are you doing?
Maurice.!
Oh, no.
Again?
You devil.!
You bad, bad man.
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One.
Oh, Maurice.
Ignition.
We have liftoff.
Oh, my God.!
One, two, three, four.
Sorry I'm late.
Your move, Mr. - Streisand.
Your move, Mr. Streisand.
Ah!
Let's not tell him about the Anchorage-New York plane crash.
If he finds out he's dead, the evening'll be a total drag.
Isn't she lovely?
Maggie?
Miss Scarlet.
Gilliam, I don't care whether you like it or- Well, that was fast.
Oh.
I'm surprised that there's someone in New York who-
No, I've never heard of a Dr. David Ginsberg.
Ginsberg.
Jewish.
This may come as a shock to you, but not every Jew in New York knows every other Jew in New York.
We're not like the-the Masons.
We don't have a secret handshake.
No, not the Masons.
The Freemasons.
Look, forget I mentioned- Okay, fine.
I will look forward to seeing his face.
Oh, boy.
The substitute New York Jewish doctor.
I know the type.
You do?
You bet your mukluks I do.
Dr. David Ginsberg.
B.A., City College, M.D., Columbia University.
Do I know guys like him?
I am guys like him.
He's gonna love Cicely, Alaska.
- Hello.
I'd like to see the doctor.
- That's him.
Can I help you?
May I speak to you a moment in private?
Sure.
Have I seen you before, Ms. -
Klochner.
No, I'm just passing through.
It's Ben's week to tag snowshoe hares.
Sounds thrilling.
Who's Ben?
- My husband.
- Oh.
Okay.
Well, what seems to be your, uh, problem?
Oh, it's not me.
It's Maurice.
Maurice?
Maurice Minnifield?
Last night in the middle of the night, he was snoring away
- Wait, wait.
Wait.
Excuse me, Mrs. Klochner.
I mean, I don't mean to be invasive or anything, but- just to make sure I'm totally clear on this - we are talking about the same Maurice Minnifield?
Yes, the astronaut.
All right.
I just wanted to be clear.
Well, I was fast asleep when his snoring woke me up.
Actually, I'm-I'm quite used to Maurice's snoring.
I've come to expect it.
In an odd way, even to depend on it.
It's so- Well, you know, it's so Maurice.
Anyway, I came awake with a start, and I glanced over at Maurice... who not only had stopped snoring, but was no longer breathing.
Wait a minute.
Maurice stopped breathing?
just like that.
If I hadn't been there to shake the air out of him,
I'm afraid to think what might have happened.
Now, Mrs. Klochner,
I realize that this is-is- it's none of my business, but, I mean, just to put this into some sort of medical perspective, um, have-have there been other occasions... where you noticed this sleep disorder?
Oh, yes.
But it was the first time he ever actually stopped breathing.
Huh.
Okay, um-
Well, tell Maurice to come in and see me.
Impossible.
He refuses to see a doctor.
I know it's a lot to ask, but, um, would you talk to him for me?
Sure.
There's a condition called sleep apnea, which is unusual in adults, actually.
Uh, you stop breathing, and then after a little while you start up again.
Is it fatal?
Only if you don't start up again.
Now, all kinds of people love all kinds of people.
None of it makes any sense, but when you get right down to it, love just doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
I'll tell you why.
Half the time, you're either tramplin' on somebody's heart, or half the time it's your heart that's got the footprints.
Now, usually it's another man or woman who does the trampling.
But in the case of our beloved founders, Cicely and Roslyn, it was that two-fisted cross-dresser Mortality who did the damage.
Chris?
Hi.
I was just, uh, practicing my Founder's Day sermon.
I don't know.
Maybe I should play up that "hardy spinster" thing.
So I guess this is a bad time, huh?
No, no.
No.
I need a break.
Come in.
What's up?
Well, I feel really stupid asking you this, but, uh, well, if a person has a- a premonition that this other person's going to die, but you're not really close to that someone or anything,
is it the premonitioner's moral obligation to warn the premonitionee?
Hmm.
Depends on the nature of the premonition.
I mean, is it a, uh, cold chill racing up and down the spine, or something more definite?
It's a dream.
A recurring dream.
Fleischman and I are playing Clue, and he's wearing this black fedora.
A black fedora?
Uh-huh.
Oh, man.
I've really gotten to likeJoel.
What does that mean?
Maggie, come on.
I mean, your history with men bein' what it is.
And a black fedora?
How's it happen?
The flight from Anchorage to New York.
No!
The whole plane goes down?
Mm-hmm.
I mean, I feel like I have to warn him.
Don't I?
Yes, I think so.
I mean, if you don't and he goes down in that plane, you gotta live with that for the rest of your life.
I know.
On the other hand, what if you tell him... and the plane that he changes to turns out to be the one that crashes?
Oh, God.
I didn't even think of that.
Oh, yeah.
This fate thing can be a tricky business.
We may have been fated to have this conversation... and then decide whatever we decide.
So-So you mean whatever my decision is, that's the thing that's gonna kill him?
It could be.
I mean, we're assuming that you have free will, and that's not really that safe an assumption.
So I-I should make a decision, and then do the opposite thing really fast?
Yes.
But you were probably fated to do that.
She told you?
Maurice, she was worried about you.
You'd better zip your lip, boy.
Now, if you say one word that tarnishes the reputation of that little lady, you will have to answer to me.
I will carry her secret to my grave.
Sure.
Sexual promiscuity is de rigueur for rock stars.
But do you have any idea- any idea- of the amount of tail that astronauts have to contend with?
No, I-I don't.
A lot.
Now, yours truly usually refrained from dipping his wick into the oil lamp, but Ingrid was one groupie that I never had the wherewithal to say no to.
Mrs. Klochner is an astronaut groupie?
Some women, when they see a man brave enough to blast off... into the darkness of infinity in a Thinsulite suit-
A lot of women get excited.
Excited, maybe.
Excited, okay.
But-But this is way beyond excited.
This is
- This is-
This is really excited.
Look, Maurice, the only way for me to see if you have sleep apnea is to watch you sleep.
No, sir.
No way.
But, Maurice-
Do you think that I'm gonna lie there, sleeping like a baby, while you're crawling all over me?
I just wanna check your breathing.
Yeah, and look in my ears and shine a light up my nose and God knows what else.
And I won't be able to do a damn thing about it.
How would you like it if I watched you sleep?
I wouldn't, but- Good.
It's kinky.
Case closed.
There.
You see?
It's moving.
You did it.
You fixed it.
Give a man a set of combination wrenches, and he can fix anything.
just one more little tweak.
That's got it.
Is that beautiful or what?
Beautiful?
Try late.
I put a call into someone somewhere six weeks ago.
Where'd you walk in from, Nome?
New York.
Red-eye from Kennedy.
Serious nightmare.
They showed Marked For Death.
You're my replacement?
You're Dr. Ginsberg?
Oh, please.
I can't handle this "Doctor" stuff.
He likes to be called Dave.
I hope you don't mind.
I, uh, took a look around the office.
Well, it came furnished.
I didn't have to touch a thing.
I can see that.
You know, usually I turn down these substitute gigs.
I mean, hey, say what you will about New York, but I see a lot of variety in my practice.
I can't complain.
But when they said Alaska-
I mean, we're talkin' serious wilderness here.
Am I right?
We're talkin' unspoiled beauty.
We're talkin' a city boy's dream come true... for two fabulous weeks.
You're actually looking forward to your stay here?
- Oh, you bet.
- Where you from in New York?
- Flushing.
- Flushing?
- You know Flushing?
- Yeah, I'm from Flushing. 139th and Main.
- By the Long Island Railroad.
- Right.
How about that?
Small world.
Huh.
Well, I'll just- I'll get this stuff out of your way.
I'll just toss it all in the, uh-
I'm gonna get this Tlingit language down if it's the last thing I do.
Dr. Fleischman, is Dave still in there?
Yeah, yeah, Dave's still in there.
Oh, good.
Hey, Ed.
What do you think about this Dave, anyway?
Oh, he's nice.
Yeah?
You base that conclusion on what?
His niceness.
Plus, he's an excellent doctor.
Yeah?
How do you know that?
Well, he's Jewish, and he's from New York.
That Dave, Jewish?
Give me a break.
The man's got no pigmentation.
His roots are blond.
Scandinavian?
His hair roots.
The guy's a Jewish impostor, Ed.
Some goyish overachiever who changed his name from Gilmore to Ginsberg to get credibility.
jewish!
Give me a break.
What Jew who looks like that fixes heaters?
Michael Landon.
Michael Landon's Jewish?
Little Joe?
You gotta be kidding me.
Nope.
Well, I'm tellin' you, Ginsberg's not.
Hey, what do I care?
I'm outta here in two days.
Oh, you.
I thought you'd be inside.
Dave's inside.
Uh, I better go see him while he's still there.
See ya.
What's up, O'Connell?
Look, uh, I know you've got a plane to catch in Anchorage on Saturday, and I know I'm supposed to fly you there, but I have this errand I have to run Saturday afternoon,
and by the time I'm finished we'll be really late.
So I'm really sorry, but you'll have to change your flight.
Okay?
Thanks.
What are you talking about?
Change my flight?
I've been planning this trip for weeks.
Sorry.
You have an errand?
You have an errand?
What errand?
It's personal.
It's a personal errand.
What, you have to pick up your dry cleaning?
You're lyin', O'Connell.
You're just tryin' to weasel out of an agreement.
There's no errand.
You just don't wanna take me to Anchorage.
Hey, I spent the last four months living for this vacation.
I know.
I know.
So?
It's just I keep having this stupid dream about your plane crashing.
What?
You heard me.
You wanna cancel my trip because you dreamed my plane crashed?
Yes.
No.
You died.
Oh.
You dreamt about me?
On several occasions.
You're
- So you're worried about me?
Concerned, Fleischman.
I'm concerned.
You know, the kind of generic, impersonal concern you have for any living creature.
I'm touched.
Oh, please.
No, I am- Hey, I really am.
You're an unbelievable egomaniac.
You know that, Fleischman?
You really are worried about me.
Fine.
Fine.
You wanna turn this into some sop for your male vanity, go ahead.
But I have warned you, and your life is in your hands now.
As opposed to whose?
Yours?
Well, now, this time of year, the best place is the Ugamak Pass.
Tuck your tent into a drift, you got shelter on three sides, stars close enough to touch.
Build a little fire.
You sit quiet enough, the elk'll come out to watch the light.
I saw four in one night.
Killed every last one of' em.
Mazel tov.
He's got antlers up the wazoo.
You wouldn't maybe feel like blowin' a couple of moose away this weekend, would you?
I mean, you and me?
Thank you, Dave.
But, uh, a few years ago, I started seein' things through elk eyes.
Now the only thing I shoot wildlife with is Fujifilm.
Oh.
Right.
Dr. Fleischman?
Ed?
Two mooseburgers, medium well.
Thank you, Shelly.
Welcome.
Now I've lost my train of thought.
You said, "Dr. Fleischman. "
Oh, right.
Dr. Fleischman?
Ed?
Um, do you like me?
Of course I like you.
Oh, good.
So you'll sell your plane ticket then.
Well, I don't like you that much.
Ed, I don't like anyone that much.
I'm goin' to New York.
I'm not changing my plans because of some facockta dream.
But you were at the Video Society.
You saw It's A Wonderful Life.
Yeah?
So?
So, don't you remember?
jimmy Stewart thought he'd wasted his whole life.
Then he saw the effect he'd had on other people's lives around him.
I mean, just imagine what this town would be like without you.
Can you imagine that, Dr. Fleischman?
Imagine.
I mean, just imagine.
?
I'm as corny as Kansas in August?
?
High as a flag on the 4th of July?
?
If you'll excuse an expression I use?
?
I'm in love, I'm in love I'm in love, I'm in love?
?
I'm in love with a wonderful guy?
Thanks, Maurice.
I think it's time to propose a toast... to a little lady who means an awful lot to me.
I think you know exactly who I'm talking about.
Oh.
Yes.
Thanks.
Ah!
You're so good to me, Maurice.
It's just that, um-
What?
What are you trying to say, Ingrid?
I think maybe I should stay in town tonight.
T
- T-Tonight?
You mean, the whole night?
Yes.
Ingrid, you know I'm better in the morning.
This was just a-a prelude, a- a preliminary to the main event.
I just don't feel right about-
Because I wasn't the first to ride the top of that rocket?
My God, Ingrid, I'm not Shepard.
Don't you think I spend my whole life thinking,
"Why Al?
Why Al?
Why Al?"
Maurice, this has nothing to do with- All right, I'm-I'm second string.
Grissom took his ride before me.
Go ahead, say it.
I'm second string.
Maurice, it's not about flying.
You stopped breathing last night.
And you think Schirra never paused in his breathing?
Think again.
I'm just worried that you might- Might what?
I'm worried you might die.
Now, hold the phone, now.
I do start breathing again, don't I?
So far.
As to the psycho-sexual bent of our founders, let's just say that they were very, very close.
I mean, they had a good thing, they were lucky to have it, and we were lucky to have them.
Cicely and Roslyn created the place that we call home, sweet home, so remember them however you like.
They won't mind.
They're dead.
But, folks, please, do remember them.
And while our mental gears are shifted into memory,
I'd like to call a little attention to a fella... that we've gotten pretty attached to here the last few months.
A guy that we refer to as Dr. Fleischman.
Well, he just might go away for two weeks.
Well, how many people know about Maggie's dream?
Wow.
Oh, my-
Shelly!
They pried it out of me.
Okay, all right, sure, he can come back.
And, uh, true, even if he doesn't, we still have Dave.
But I'd like to take a little time now... to-to pay our respects to Joel while we know we still can.
Anyone?
Ruth-Anne?
When I remember Dr. Fleischman, I- Wait a minute.!
She has one stupid dream, and-and that's it?
I'm history?
Well, Joel, you were wearing the fedora.
Well, I-I just think that Dr. Fleischman is a fine doctor and a very interesting person.
And I feel really bad about Elaine breaking up with him.
I can't help but think had she known about the plane wreck, she might have gone ahead and waited until he was dead.
I think that would have been the tactful way to handle it.
Marilyn?
He taught me how to use the hold button.
I always wanted to be at my own funeral.
This way, you can see what people thought about you.
Anyone else?
Shelly?
Dr. Fleischman is sweet and kind and gentle and honest.
He's a good doctor.
And he was a real friend to me when I thought I was pregnant... and when I discovered I wasn't.
And besides all that, he's ethnic, which is kind of cool.
- And he's cute.
- Cute?
Yeah?
You think so?
- Very cute.
- Wouldn't go that far.
- I would.
- I find him attractive.
All I'm saying is, I can see why Maggie's had dreams about him.
Dream.
Singular.
One dream!
Hey, you stop lookin' at me like that.
Look, you guys are the ones that said he was cute.
I never said he was cute!
You know, I've been having some serious thoughts lately about that winged chariot - time.
Sooner or later, it sweeps us all away.
I know that, Maurice.
Well, this boy might be swept away tomorrow.
He might go off on that rocket ship to the hereafter.
A man likes sweet words from a woman when he's about to go into the beyond.
It bucks him up.
All right, have it your own way!
But, remember, you may never see him again.
?
I'm a little teapot, short and stout?
?
Here is my handle Here is my spout?
?
When I get all steamed up?
?
Then I shout?
?
Just tip me over and pour me out?
All right.
Okay.
Oh, sorry.
I was just cheering them up after their tetanus boosters.
Well, don't stop anything on account of me.
Oh.
That's okay.
It's almost dinnertime.
This is Grandpa Jim.
He's dead.
Oh.
Well, he-he looks very nice.
If you see him, tell him Grandma's only marrying Mr. Skinner for his microwave.
Well, Joel, I've gotta hit the road too.
I just dropped by for a sec to bring some oatmeal cookies that I baked for Dave.
Mmm, oatmeal.
My favorite.
You baked him oatmeal cookies?
Mm-hmm.
Bye, Dave.
Bye.
I brought you something.
What-What are you trying to tell me?
I should paddle to New York?
It's to ease your journey to the other side.
Okay.
Okay.
You win.
I'm spooked.
I admit it.
I am officially unsettled.
I give up.
It's not worth it.
I have my pride, but I'll be damned if I'm gonna die for it.
What'd the airline say?
Can I use my frequent flyer ticket for the 6:00 a. m. flight?
It's a extra $600.
$600?
Yeah, over my dead body.
Okay, damn it.
Watch me sleep.
Huh?
All that stuff I was sayin;..
about winged chariots got to me.
It was creepy, and damned moving.
And I decided if it was that important to, uh
- Well, you know who I'm talking about.
You can check me for sleep whats is tonight.
Are we talking, uh, sleep apnea here?
Yeah.
I did a study on sleep apnea.
It's sort of a hobby of mine.
You know, it's often a misdiagnosis-
Forget it, Ginsberg.
Maurice is my patient.
I'll make his diagnosis.
"All at once he was through max G,
"as if through a turbulent straight, and the trajectory was smooth, and he was supersonic, and the pressure in his chest reached six G's. "
I mean, Proust, HenryJames, those guys could put me to sleep.
But The Right Stuff?
.
Shh!
This is the best part coming up here.
"The rocket pitched down, and in a moment, there it was.
And his body slammed forward as if it were screeching to a halt. '"
Look, I hate to spoil the slumber party, but, uh, this stuff's gonna give me nightmares.
Can we just skip to the stuff about Sally Rand and the striptease?
All right, Ingrid.
The boy's gettin' antsy.
Go ahead.
Leave us alone.
I'm primed.
Good night, Maurice.
I'll be in the guest room if you need me.
Good night, Ingrid.
Joel, there goes a fine woman.
I guess it's kind of cornball, me goin' on and on like this about her.
No.
Actually, it's kind of sweet.
- Sweet?
- Yeah.
Joel... we're talkin' sex here, pure and simple.
Now, it may be a lot of things, but, uh, it's not sweet.
What Ingrid and I have is, uh, comparable to a fully-loaded X-15... firing at 57,000 pounds of thrust.
You may not understand that now, but when you get to be an old bear like me, you will.
Oops.
Sorry.
Forgot about the crash.
That was tactless of me.
But, you know, in a way, Joel,
I envy you your demise.
You envy my dying?
Yeah.
Well, it comes to all of us, son.
You know what my greatest fear is?
Slipping in the shower.
Having a heart attack sitting on the john.
Sleep apnea.
Goin' out with a whimper instead of a bang.
You know, Fleischman, in a lot of ways, you're lucky.
Lucky?
You'll be sailing along peacefully.
Then all of a sudden, wham!
You're pinned back against your seat, wind screaming in your ears,
cold air everywhere, glass shattering, darkness coming at you from all directions.
And then... oblivion.
Nothing but ice, more ice.
As far as the eye can see, just ice.
Ice.
Sure.
Must be the polar route.
I'll tell you a secret.
I had some strong reservations about getting on this plane.
No kidding?
Do you believe in fate?
Predestination?
No.
I'm an existentialist.
Me too.
Well, really more like a rational humanist.
Sweetheart, what's important is the here and the now.
People should learn to relax and take life as it comes.
Hey, I like your philosophy, Mrs. -
- Streisand.
- Streisand?
Wait.
Where-Where have I heard that name before?
Wait a minute.
You're not-
We're related by marriage, hon, not by blood.
Oh.
Let me buy you a drink, Mrs. Streisand.
Sure.
Stewardess?
Hey, O'Connell.
Champagne?
You'll be needing this.
- Hey, what's that thing on your back?
- Parachute.
Wait.
Flight attendants aren't supposed to wear parachutes.
How do you think the passengers feel-
- O'Connell-
- Bon voyage, Fleischman.
Now, there's a lovely girl.
Bon voyage.!
Joel?
Joel?
Look alive, son.
My back.
So, how's my sleep apnea?
You don't have it.
I watched you for six hours.
Your breathing is perfectly regular.
Hey.
No kiddin'?
- Ingrid!
- Is, um
- Is he all right?
He's fine.
There's nothing wrong with his breathing.
Oh.
Well, why don't you keep my afghan till next year?
I'm, uh
- I'm traveling light.
Traveling?
The green-winged teals are flying soon.
Oh, so soon?
At least I know you're all right.
Oh, I'm fit as a-
Excuse me.
Damn!
Maurice, have you spent a lot of time around mohair?
Well, the only experience I can recall... was my-my mama knitted me a mohair sweater when I was around 10 years old.
And when you put it on, do you recall having any reaction to it?
I think I went into a three-day coma.
From now on, stick to cashmere.
You have what is called a severe allergy.
You mean, if we get rid of this damn blanket, we can-
Absolutely.
Happy landings.
Nice look.
Very homey.
Nice.
Very nice.
Nice decor.
I like your style.
I'm sorry.
I thought you'd be on your-
Well, it's just a few touches so I'd feel more-
I mean, I'll clear them all away if you ever-
I mean, when you-
- Forget it.
- I didn't throw any of your stuff away.
- You are a prince, Ginsberg.
A real mensch.
- Thanks.
- I wish you naches.
- Oh, thanks.
Naches is one of those words- I mean, you always hear, but you never really know exactly what it means.
Does anyone really know?
Do you, Ginsberg?
Well, happiness, luck.
Uh-huh.
It actually dates from the 12th century, when, uh, naches... were the spice cakes they gave travelers-
All right, all right!
I mean, you're not really Gilmore.
Look, I know how much you like it here and how great everyone thinks you are, but, uh, there's been a change of plans.
A change?
Yeah, yeah.
I don't know how to spring this on you, but we've run into a little scheduling problem.
Scheduling?
So it's been a pleasure to meet you, Dave.
Wait!
I'm only sorry you couldn't stay longer, but-
Look, I'm sure there's a doctor in Yellowknife or somethin' who'll need a substitute.
Okay?
Well, take care.
If you find yourself in Cicely, don't be a stranger.
Joel, I don't understand.
I-
Bye, Dave.
Joel?
Joel.!
Did you knock?
Uh, I was getting around to it.
How long have you been standing out there?
Not long.
Five, 10 minutes.
You wanna come in?
So
- Huh.
"Huh" what?
Well, I've never just, you know, visited you before, you know?
I mean, socially.
Oh.
Look, uh, I don't wanna get too personal or anything, but is there like some reason you were so concerned with my safety?
I mean, it's not like you and I are
- No.
- We've never-
- God, no.
So why are you having these dreams about me?
I don't know.
Can I suggest an explanation?
No.
Come on, O'Connell.
just admit that once, in your heart ofhearts, you have had feelings for me.
Well, I- Not feelings, Fleischman.
I wouldn't qualify them as feelings.
They're more like occasional... thoughts.
Thoughts?
Yeah, you know, thoughts.
Yeah, okay.
You've had thoughts about me.
Or maybe more like impulses.
Impulses?
No, thoughts.
What do you mean, thought-type thoughts or fantasy-type thoughts?
Can we change the subject?
Yeah, sure.
No problem.
Well, what was I wearing?
All right.
Come on, O'Connell.
just admit you don't want me to go.
I never said that.
You want me to take that plane?
Why are you doing this, Fleischman?
Tell me to take that doomed flight, and I will.
Well?
Oh, what the hell.
Don't think I'm doing this because I'm superstitious.
I'm not.
It's just I don't feel right about leaving my patients with that quack Ginsberg.
Good night.
?
You do?
?
Something to me?
?
Something that simply mystifies me?
?
Tell me?
?
Why should it be?
?
You have the power?
?
To hypnotize me?
You know what I think?
I think they did it together.
I mean, they both really hated his guts.
I bet you anything... they were in cahoots from the beginning.
Professor Plum and Mrs. White?
Well, yeah.
Sometimes, they get stuck together.
I once had to pry Colonel Mustard off of Mrs. Peacock's back.
Three cards, O'Connell-- location, weapon and murderer.
One murderer.
It's after 1 0:00.
I gotta go.
[ Sighs ] I can see every card in your hand.
- So, don't look.
- I can't help it.
How about turning up the heat, O'Connell?
I'm freezing.
Can I wear this?
Oh, I don't think you should.
What?
Rick's gonna mind?
No, it's not his.
So, what's the big deal?
Go, already.
I'm gonna miss my plane.
Well, we both know it's the library.
This is stupid, O'Connell.
You can't play the game of Clue with two people.
It is obviously Colonel Mustard with the candlestick in the library.
Now, can we leave?
Please?
Oh, I don't want you to go.
Stay.
Stay.
Stay.
[ Animal Howling ]
Give me something really, really stupid.
I don't think we have anything that stupid, Dr. Fleischman.
Well, then give me something really touristy.
How about some willow ptarmigan candies?
It's the state bird, so it's good for tourists.
And it's marzipan, so it's nice and filling.
Great.
I'll take three boxes.
Okay.
One each for your folks, and one for--
Now, isn't that a nice thought?
I wouldn't be surprised if she took you back.
It's not for Elaine.
It's for-- Uh-huh.
You know-- I have a lot of friends in New York.
Friends from med school, friends from college, friends from-from Bronx Science.
I'm still in touch with Richie Marx.
We had our bar mitzvah together.
It was a Temple Beth Shalom double bill.
Yeah.
He's gonna get us tickets to, uh, Sinead O'Connor.
She's playing the Palladium.
Oh, great.
I don't even know if I can pack it all into two weeks.
When you come right down to it, what's the point of comin' back here at all?
You'll get thrown in the slammer for breach of contract.
Okay.
There's a point.
Morning, Maggie.
Hi.
- Hello, O'Connell.
- Hi.
Your chair's out back.
That's a heavy old thing.
I had to help the guy lug it off the truck.
Thanks, thanks.
just stocking' up for my little trip back to the Big Apple.
I'm goin' bullish on ptarmigans.
Care for a box as a memento?
Bite a ptarmigan's head off, you'll be flooded with memories of me.
Mmm, no, thanks.
Um, I'll just go get the truck.
- You better get Rick to give you a hand.
- Oh, I can't.
He's in the Aleutians.
- I'll give you a hand.
- You will?
Sure.
Why not?
Is this a dirty trick, Fleischman?
What, like a practical joke?
Like, I'm gonna help you with the chair and drop it on your foot?
- Yeah.
- Absolutely not.
Well, thanks, Fleischman.
That's, uh--
That's-That's sweet.
Oh, I appreciate it, I do.
It's just that I have this Pavlovian response to you, and I can never really express my appreciation.
To you, that is, because you're sneaky and duplicitous and self-serving, and I always think you have a hidden agenda.
You're welcome.
Be back in five minutes for the marzipan.
Okay, Joel.
I'll get 'em wrapped up for you.
[ Chris ] Trapped as we are on that merry-go-round of time, we've circled around once again to the annual Cicely, Alaska birthday bash extravaganza.
That's right.
Tomorrow's Founder's Day, when we all get together out at the church and mark that special day back in 1 93 2... when Cicely and Roslyn stalled out here on the cusp of the new Alaskan Riviera... and had to make the best of a bad situation.
That's a damn lie.
Now, nobody really knows for sure what happened in that stalled car out in the woods... with Cicely and her very special friend Roslyn.
Damn it!
I told him to lay off that lesbian angle!
All alone, a little homesick, couple of slugs out of Roslyn's hip flask.
One thing leads to another.
Hey, come on.
We've all seen Cicely's picture.
Sure, she's a little heavy-set, on the jowly side, but very attractive in a Margaret Thatcher kind of way.
It's not an angle, Maurice.
Cicely and Roslyn loved each other deeply.
That's why they came to Alaska in the first place.
They couldn't find acceptance in polite Billings society.
Well, why in the hell did they have to find it here?
I've got nothing against Sapphic love.
I've been to some erotic movies myself.
But why hold up Hecate and Persephone and whoever to the rest of the world and say,
""Hey, look, folks.
This is what we're all about"?
You get into areas of attraction, and we're talkin' serious mystery here.
Shh!
This is it.
And while we are talking mystery, the Video Society continues Death and Devastation Month this Wednesday at Ruth-Anne's library.
Tonight's selection, Pile-Up On Highway 1 0, is on loan from the private collection of Ed.
?
[Jazz ]
Well, guess that was my 1 5 minutes.
?
[ Man Singing, Indistinct ]
Ingrid.!
Is it April already?
Time does fly.
Seems like I just left, doesn't it?
Yeah.
Hi, Ed.
I heard your name on the radio just now.
Oh, thanks!
- You're looking well, Ingrid.
- Well, you're looking good yourself, Maurice.
Your squeeze off on the ice again?
Yeah.
The snowshoe hare population's up eight percent.
Doesn't he freeze out there in just that itty-bitty pup tent?
[ Chuckles ] He doesn't even notice it.
From now until the end of tagging season, he thinks about nothing but hares, hares, hares.
I can dig it.
[ Both Straining ]
Such a help.
Watch-Watch the legs.
This way.
This way.
This way.
This way.
Thank you.
What is this thing made of, melted-down anvils?
Oh, great, Fleischman.
My records!
I hope you take better care of your airplane.
They were in alphabetical order.
Very classy, O'Connell.
Cole Porter.
You ever hear Sinead O'Connor sing ""You Do Something To Me"?
It's fantastic.
All right, where do you want this thing?
Over there in the corner, please.
Ah, yes.
Under the memorial shrines.
I think scrapbooks are cliché.
Huh.
How many boyfriends have you lost?
Four.
This is definitely original.
No, I'm serious.
[ Maggie ] Well, I used to have candles, but I worried that they'd burn the dioramas.
A lot of those figurines are crayons.
Crayons?
Yeah, I melt them down, pour them into molds.
Then after they cool off, I put on their little outfits.
Where'd you pick up the plastic sushi?
Sitka.
Harry's is the worst.
I mean, no matter what I do, talcum powder does not look like snow.
But Roy's is good, though.
He loved those California rolls.
Why do they all have these little black polka dots all over them?
Those are the black fedoras.
The black fedoras?
Yeah, symbolizing-- Well, you know.
Death?
Right.
And what does the glued-on macaroni symbolize?
Man's inhumanity to man?
Nothing, Fleischman.
They symbolize nothing.
They're macaroni.
What are you gonna do for Rick, a toy plane and a tiny Soloflex machine?
Very amusing.
Now, just put the chair by the sushi.
[ Ingrid ] You're amazing.
[ Man Moans ]
Incredible.
Spectacular.
[ Both Laughing ]
Better than the Buzzer?
I know, I know.
I wouldn't want you to talk about me to them.
Oh, you're the one with the privacy fetish.
No dining out, no strolling through town.
I've got your reputation to protect.
Girl like you, small town like this--
You could be ruined in a week if tongues started wagging.
You're sweet.
[ Both Moaning ]
Very sweet.
As sweet as Johnno?
Maurice, you're so silly.
Oh, I bet he's great in the sack, huh?
Unimaginative, but very, very dependable.
A missionary man all the way.
Am I right?
What if I don't tell you?
What if I make you?
I've got something that'll break down those defenses.
[ Laughing ]
What are you doing?
Maurice.!
Oh, no.
Again?
You devil.!
[ Both Laughing ]
You bad, bad man.
[ Both Moaning ]
[ Man On TV] Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One.
Oh, Maurice.
Ignition.
We have liftoff.
[ Ingrid ] Oh, my God.!
One, two, three, four.
Sorry I'm late.
Your move, Mr.-- Streisand.
Your move, Mr. Streisand.
Ah!
[ Dice Clattering ]
Let's not tell him about the Anchorage-New York plane crash.
If he finds out he's dead, the evening'll be a total drag.
Isn't she lovely?
Maggie?
Miss Scarlet.
[ Gasps ]
[ Snoring ]
[ Snoring Stops ]
[ Snoring Resumes ]
Gilliam, I don't care whether you like it or-- Well, that was fast.
Oh.
I'm surprised that there's someone in New York who--
No, I've never heard of a Dr. David Ginsberg.
Ginsberg.
Jewish.
This may come as a shock to you, but not every Jew in New York knows every other Jew in New York.
We're not like the-the Masons.
We don't have a secret handshake.
No, not the Masons.
The Freemasons.
Look, forget I mentioned-- Okay, fine.
I will look forward to seeing his face.
Oh, boy.
The substitute New York Jewish doctor.
I know the type.
You do?
You bet your mukluks I do.
Dr. David Ginsberg.
B.A., City College, M.D., Columbia University.
Do I know guys like him?
I am guys like him.
He's gonna love Cicely, Alaska.
[ Door Opens ]
- Hello.
I'd like to see the doctor.
- That's him.
Can I help you?
May I speak to you a moment in private?
Sure.
Have I seen you before, Ms.--
Klochner.
No, I'm just passing through.
It's Ben's week to tag snowshoe hares.
Sounds thrilling.
Who's Ben?
- My husband.
- Oh.
Okay.
Well, what seems to be your, uh, problem?
Oh, it's not me.
It's Maurice.
Maurice?
Maurice Minnifield?
Last night in the middle of the night, he was snoring away-- Wait, wait.
Wait.
Excuse me, Mrs. Klochner.
I mean, I don't mean to be invasive or anything, but-- just to make sure I'm totally clear on this-- we are talking about the same Maurice Minnifield?
Yes, the astronaut.
All right.
I just wanted to be clear.
Well, I was fast asleep when his snoring woke me up.
Actually, I'm-I'm quite used to Maurice's snoring.
I've come to expect it.
In an odd way, even to depend on it.
It's so-- Well, you know, it's so Maurice.
Anyway, I came awake with a start, and I glanced over at Maurice... who not only had stopped snoring, but was no longer breathing.
Wait a minute.
Maurice stopped breathing?
just like that.
If I hadn't been there to shake the air out of him,
I'm afraid to think what might have happened.
Now, Mrs. Klochner,
I realize that this is-is-- it's none of my business, but, I mean, just to put this into some sort of medical perspective, um, have-have there been other occasions... where you noticed this sleep disorder?
Oh, yes.
But it was the first time he ever actually stopped breathing.
Huh.
Okay, um--
Well, tell Maurice to come in and see me.
Impossible.
He refuses to see a doctor.
I know it's a lot to ask, but, um, would you talk to him for me?
Sure.
There's a condition called sleep apnea, which is unusual in adults, actually.
Uh, you stop breathing, and then after a little while you start up again.
Is it fatal?
Only if you don't start up again.
[ Chris ] Now, all kinds of people love all kinds of people.
None of it makes any sense, but when you get right down to it, love just doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
I'll tell you why.
Half the time, you're either tramplin' on somebody's heart, or half the time it's your heart that's got the footprints.
Now, usually it's another man or woman who does the trampling.
But in the case of our beloved founders, Cicely and Roslyn, it was that two-fisted cross-dresser Mortality who did the damage.
Chris?
Hi.
I was just, uh, practicing my Founder's Day sermon.
I don't know.
Maybe I should play up that ""hardy spinster" thing.
So I guess this is a bad time, huh?
No, no.
No.
I need a break.
Come in.
What's up?
Well, I feel really stupid asking you this, but, uh, well, if a person has a-- a premonition that this other person's going to die, but you're not really close to that someone or anything,
is it the premonitioner's moral obligation to warn the premonitionee?
Hmm.
Depends on the nature of the premonition.
I mean, is it a, uh, cold chill racing up and down the spine, or something more definite?
It's a dream.
A recurring dream.
Fleischman and I are playing Clue, and he's wearing this black fedora.
A black fedora?
Uh-huh.
Oh, man.
[ Sighs ] I've really gotten to likeJoel.
What does that mean?
Maggie, come on.
I mean, your history with men bein' what it is.
And a black fedora?
How's it happen?
The flight from Anchorage to New York.
No!
The whole plane goes down?
Mm-hmm.
I mean, I feel like I have to warn him.
Don't I?
Yes, I think so.
I mean, if you don't and he goes down in that plane, you gotta live with that for the rest of your life.
I know.
On the other hand, what if you tell him... and the plane that he changes to turns out to be the one that crashes?
Oh, God.
I didn't even think of that.
Oh, yeah.
This fate thing can be a tricky business.
We may have been fated to have this conversation... and then decide whatever we decide.
So-So you mean whatever my decision is, that's the thing that's gonna kill him?
It could be.
I mean, we're assuming that you have free will, and that's not really that safe an assumption.
So I-I should make a decision, and then do the opposite thing really fast?
Yes.
But you were probably fated to do that.
She told you?
Maurice, she was worried about you.
You'd better zip your lip, boy.
Now, if you say one word that tarnishes the reputation of that little lady, you will have to answer to me.
I will carry her secret to my grave.
Sure.
Sexual promiscuity is de rigueur for rock stars.
But do you have any idea-- any idea-- of the amount of tail that astronauts have to contend with?
No, I-I don't.
A lot.
Now, yours truly usually refrained from dipping his wick into the oil lamp, but Ingrid was one groupie that I never had the wherewithal to say no to.
Mrs. Klochner is an astronaut groupie?
Some women, when they see a man brave enough to blast off... into the darkness of infinity in a Thinsulite suit--
A lot of women get excited.
Excited, maybe.
Excited, okay.
But-But this is way beyond excited.
This is-
- This is--
This is really excited.
Look, Maurice, the only way for me to see if you have sleep apnea is to watch you sleep.
No, sir.
No way.
But, Maurice--
Do you think that I'm gonna lie there, sleeping like a baby, while you're crawling all over me?
I just wanna check your breathing.
Yeah, and look in my ears and shine a light up my nose and God knows what else.
And I won't be able to do a damn thing about it.
How would you like it if I watched you sleep?
I wouldn't, but-- Good.
It's kinky.
Case closed.
[ Man ] There.
You see?
It's moving.
[ Barking ]
[ Marilyn ] You did it.
You fixed it.
[ Man ] Give a man a set of combination wrenches, and he can fix anything.
just one more little tweak.
That's got it.
Is that beautiful or what?
[Joel ] Beautiful?
Try late.
I put a call into someone somewhere six weeks ago.
Where'd you walk in from, Nome?
New York.
Red-eye from Kennedy.
Serious nightmare.
They showed Marked For Death.
You're my replacement?
You're Dr. Ginsberg?
Oh, please.
I can't handle this ""Doctor" stuff.
He likes to be called Dave.
I hope you don't mind.
I, uh, took a look around the office.
Well, it came furnished.
I didn't have to touch a thing.
I can see that.
You know, usually I turn down these substitute gigs.
I mean, hey, say what you will about New York, but I see a lot of variety in my practice.
I can't complain.
But when they said Alaska--
I mean, we're talkin' serious wilderness here.
Am I right?
We're talkin' unspoiled beauty.
We're talkin' a city boy's dream come true... for two fabulous weeks.
You're actually looking forward to your stay here?
- Oh, you bet.
- Where you from in New York?
- Flushing.
- Flushing?
- You know Flushing?
- Yeah, I'm from Flushing.
1 39th and Main.
- By the Long Island Railroad.
- Right.
How about that?
Small world.
Huh.
Well, I'll just-- I'll get this stuff out of your way.
I'll just toss it all in the, uh-- [ Speaking Tlingit Slowly ] [ Tlingit ]
[ Repeats Phrase ] I'm gonna get this Tlingit language down if it's the last thing I do.
Dr. Fleischman, is Dave still in there?
Yeah, yeah, Dave's still in there.
Oh, good.
Hey, Ed.
What do you think about this Dave, anyway?
Oh, he's nice.
Yeah?
You base that conclusion on what?
His niceness.
Plus, he's an excellent doctor.
Yeah?
How do you know that?
Well, he's Jewish, and he's from New York.
That Dave, Jewish?
Give me a break.
The man's got no pigmentation.
His roots are blond.
Scandinavian?
His hair roots.
The guy's a Jewish impostor, Ed.
Some goyish overachiever who changed his name from Gilmore to Ginsberg to get credibility.
jewish!
Give me a break.
What Jew who looks like that fixes heaters?
Michael Landon.
Michael Landon's Jewish?
Little Joe?
You gotta be kidding me.
Nope.
Well, I'm tellin' you, Ginsberg's not.
Hey, what do I care?
I'm outta here in two days.
Oh, you.
I thought you'd be inside.
Dave's inside.
Uh, I better go see him while he's still there.
See ya.
What's up, O'Connell?
Look, uh, I know you've got a plane to catch in Anchorage on Saturday, and I know I'm supposed to fly you there, but I have this errand I have to run Saturday afternoon,
and by the time I'm finished we'll be really late.
So I'm really sorry, but you'll have to change your flight.
Okay?
Thanks.
What are you talking about?
Change my flight?
I've been planning this trip for weeks.
Sorry.
You have an errand?
You have an errand?
What errand?
It's personal.
It's a personal errand.
What, you have to pick up your dry cleaning?
You're lyin', O'Connell.
You're just tryin' to weasel out of an agreement.
There's no errand.
You just don't wanna take me to Anchorage.
Hey, I spent the last four months living for this vacation.
I know.
I know.
So?
[ Sighs ] It's just I keep having this stupid dream about your plane crashing.
What?
You heard me.
You wanna cancel my trip because you dreamed my plane crashed?
Yes.
No.
You died.
Oh.
You dreamt about me?
On several occasions.
You're-
- So you're worried about me?
Concerned, Fleischman.
I'm concerned.
You know, the kind of generic, impersonal concern you have for any living creature.
I'm touched.
Oh, please.
No, I am-- Hey, I really am.
You're an unbelievable egomaniac.
You know that, Fleischman?
You really are worried about me.
Fine.
Fine.
You wanna turn this into some sop for your male vanity, go ahead.
But I have warned you, and your life is in your hands now.
As opposed to whose?
Yours?
[ Barking ]
Well, now, this time of year, the best place is the Ugamak Pass.
Tuck your tent into a drift, you got shelter on three sides, stars close enough to touch.
Build a little fire.
You sit quiet enough, the elk'll come out to watch the light.
I saw four in one night.
Killed every last one of' em.
Mazel tov.
He's got antlers up the wazoo.
You wouldn't maybe feel like blowin' a couple of moose away this weekend, would you?
I mean, you and me?
Thank you, Dave.
But, uh, a few years ago, I started seein' things through elk eyes.
Now the only thing I shoot wildlife with is Fujifilm.
Oh.
Right.
Dr. Fleischman?
Ed?
Two mooseburgers, medium well.
Thank you, Shelly.
Welcome.
Now I've lost my train of thought.
You said, ""Dr. Fleischman."
Oh, right.
Dr. Fleischman?
Ed?
Um, do you like me?
Of course I like you.
Oh, good.
So you'll sell your plane ticket then.
Well, I don't like you that much.
Ed, I don't like anyone that much.
I'm goin' to New York.
I'm not changing my plans because of some facockta dream.
But you were at the Video Society.
You saw It's A Wonderful Life.
Yeah?
So?
So, don't you remember?
jimmy Stewart thought he'd wasted his whole life.
Then he saw the effect he'd had on other people's lives around him.
I mean, just imagine what this town would be like without you.
Can you imagine that, Dr. Fleischman?
Imagine.
I mean, just imagine.
[ All ] ?
I'm as corny as Kansas in August ?
?
High as a flag on the 4th of July?
?
If you'll excuse an expression I use ?
?
I'm in love, I'm in love I'm in love, I'm in love ?
?
I'm in love with a wonderful guy?
[ Cheering ]
Thanks, Maurice.
I think it's time to propose a toast... to a little lady who means an awful lot to me.
I think you know exactly who I'm talking about.
Oh.
Yes.
Thanks.
Ah!
You're so good to me, Maurice.
It's just that, um--
What?
What are you trying to say, Ingrid?
I think maybe I should stay in town tonight.
T-T-Tonight?
You mean, the whole night?
Yes.
Ingrid, you know I'm better in the morning.
This was just a-a prelude, a-a preliminary to the main event.
I just don't feel right about--
Because I wasn't the first to ride the top of that rocket?
My God, Ingrid, I'm not Shepard.
Don't you think I spend my whole life thinking,
""Why Al?
Why Al?
Why Al?"
Maurice, this has nothing to do with-- All right, I'm-I'm second string.
Grissom took his ride before me.
Go ahead, say it.
I'm second string.
Maurice, it's not about flying.
You stopped breathing last night.
And you think Schirra never paused in his breathing?
Think again.
I'm just worried that you might-- Might what?
I'm worried you might die.
Now, hold the phone, now.
I do start breathing again, don't I?
So far.
[ Chris ] As to the psycho-sexual bent of our founders, let's just say that they were very, very close.
I mean, they had a good thing, they were lucky to have it, and we were lucky to have them.
Cicely and Roslyn created the place that we call home, sweet home, so remember them however you like.
They won't mind.
They're dead.
But, folks, please, do remember them.
And while our mental gears are shifted into memory,
I'd like to call a little attention to a fella... that we've gotten pretty attached to here the last few months.
A guy that we refer to as Dr. Fleischman.
Well, he just might go away for two weeks.
Well, how many people know about Maggie's dream?
Wow.
Oh, my--
Shelly!
They pried it out of me.
Okay, all right, sure, he can come back.
And, uh, true, even if he doesn't, we still have Dave.
But I'd like to take a little time now... to-to pay our respects to Joel while we know we still can.
Anyone?
Ruth-Anne?
When I remember Dr. Fleischman, I-- [Joel ] Wait a minute.!
She has one stupid dream, and-and that's it?
I'm history?
Well, Joel, you were wearing the fedora.
Well, I-I just think that Dr. Fleischman is a fine doctor and a very interesting person.
And I feel really bad about Elaine breaking up with him.
I can't help but think had she known about the plane wreck, she might have gone ahead and waited until he was dead.
I think that would have been the tactful way to handle it.
[ Chris ] Marilyn?
He taught me how to use the hold button.
I always wanted to be at my own funeral.
This way, you can see what people thought about you.
[ Chris ] Anyone else?
Shelly?
Dr. Fleischman is sweet and kind and gentle and honest.
He's a good doctor.
And he was a real friend to me when I thought I was pregnant... and when I discovered I wasn't.
And besides all that, he's ethnic, which is kind of cool.
- And he's cute.
- Cute?
Yeah?
You think so?
- Very cute.
- [ Scoffs ] Wouldn't go that far.
- I would.
- I find him attractive.
All I'm saying is, I can see why Maggie's had dreams about him.
Dream.
Singular.
One dream!
Hey, you stop lookin' at me like that.
Look, you guys are the ones that said he was cute.
I never said he was cute!
You know, I've been having some serious thoughts lately about that winged chariot-- time.
Sooner or later, it sweeps us all away.
I know that, Maurice.
Well, this boy might be swept away tomorrow.
He might go off on that rocket ship to the hereafter.
A man likes sweet words from a woman when he's about to go into the beyond.
It bucks him up.
All right, have it your own way!
But, remember, you may never see him again.
[ All ] ?
I'm a little teapot, short and stout ?
?
Here is my handle Here is my spout ?
?
When I get all steamed up ?
?
Then I shout ?
?
Just tip me over and pour me out ?
All right.
Okay.
[ Applause ]
Oh, sorry.
I was just cheering them up after their tetanus boosters.
Well, don't stop anything on account of me.
Oh.
That's okay.
It's almost dinnertime.
This is Grandpa Jim.
He's dead.
Oh.
Well, he-he looks very nice.
If you see him, tell him Grandma's only marrying Mr. Skinner for his microwave.
Well, Joel, I've gotta hit the road too.
I just dropped by for a sec to bring some oatmeal cookies that I baked for Dave.
Mmm, oatmeal.
My favorite.
You baked him oatmeal cookies?
Mm-hmm.
Bye, Dave.
Bye.
I brought you something.
What-What are you trying to tell me?
I should paddle to New York?
It's to ease your journey to the other side.
Okay.
Okay.
You win.
I'm spooked.
I admit it.
I am officially unsettled.
I give up.
It's not worth it.
I have my pride, but I'll be damned if I'm gonna die for it.
What'd the airline say?
Can I use my frequent flyer ticket for the 6:00 a.m. flight?
It's a extra $600.
$600?
Yeah, over my dead body.
[ Door Slams Shut ]
Okay, damn it.
Watch me sleep.
Huh?
All that stuff I was sayin;..
about winged chariots got to me.
It was creepy, and damned moving.
And I decided if it was that important to, uh-- Well, you know who I'm talking about.
You can check me for sleep whats is tonight.
[ Dave ] Are we talking, uh, sleep apnea here?
Yeah.
I did a study on sleep apnea.
It's sort of a hobby of mine.
You know, it's often a misdiagnosis--
Forget it, Ginsberg.
Maurice is my patient.
I'll make his diagnosis.
[ Door Closes ]
""All at once he was through max G,
""as if through a turbulent straight, and the trajectory was smooth, and he was supersonic, and the pressure in his chest reached six G's."
I mean, Proust, HenryJames, those guys could put me to sleep.
But The Right Stuff?
.
Shh!
This is the best part coming up here.
""The rocket pitched down, and in a moment, there it was.
And his body slammed forward as if it were screeching to a halt. '"
Look, I hate to spoil the slumber party, but, uh, this stuff's gonna give me nightmares.
Can we just skip to the stuff about Sally Rand and the striptease?
All right, Ingrid.
The boy's gettin' antsy.
Go ahead.
Leave us alone.
I'm primed.
Good night, Maurice.
I'll be in the guest room if you need me.
Good night, Ingrid.
Joel, there goes a fine woman.
I guess it's kind of cornball, me goin' on and on like this about her.
No.
Actually, it's kind of sweet.
- Sweet?
- Yeah.
Joel... we're talkin' sex here, pure and simple.
Now, it may be a lot of things, but, uh, it's not sweet.
What Ingrid and I have is, uh, comparable to a fully-loaded X-1 5... firing at 57,000 pounds of thrust.
You may not understand that now, but when you get to be an old bear like me, you will.
Oops.
Sorry.
Forgot about the crash.
That was tactless of me.
But, you know, in a way, Joel,
I envy you your demise.
You envy my dying?
Yeah.
Well, it comes to all of us, son.
You know what my greatest fear is?
Slipping in the shower.
Having a heart attack sitting on the john.
Sleep apnea.
Goin' out with a whimper instead of a bang.
You know, Fleischman, in a lot of ways, you're lucky.
Lucky?
You'll be sailing along peacefully.
Then all of a sudden, wham!
You're pinned back against your seat, wind screaming in your ears,
cold air everywhere, glass shattering, darkness coming at you from all directions.
And then... oblivion.

[Joel ] Nothing but ice, more ice.
As far as the eye can see, just ice.
Ice.
Sure.
Must be the polar route.
I'll tell you a secret.
I had some strong reservations about getting on this plane.
No kidding?
Do you believe in fate?
Predestination?
No.
I'm an existentialist.
Me too.
Well, really more like a rational humanist.
Sweetheart, what's important is the here and the now.
People should learn to relax and take life as it comes.
Hey, I like your philosophy, Mrs.--
- Streisand.
- Streisand?
Wait.
Where-Where have I heard that name before?
Wait a minute.
You're not--
We're related by marriage, hon, not by blood.
Oh.
Let me buy you a drink, Mrs. Streisand.
Sure.
Stewardess?
Hey, O'Connell.
Champagne?
You'll be needing this.
- Hey, what's that thing on your back?
- Parachute.
Wait.
Flight attendants aren't supposed to wear parachutes.
How do you think the passengers feel--
- O'Connell--
- Bon voyage, Fleischman.
Now, there's a lovely girl.
[ Hatch Opening ] Bon voyage.!
[ Yelling ]
Joel?
Joel?
Look alive, son.
[ Groans ]
My back.
So, how's my sleep apnea?
You don't have it.
I watched you for six hours.
Your breathing is perfectly regular.
Hey.
No kiddin'?
- Ingrid!
- Is, um-
- Is he all right?
He's fine.
There's nothing wrong with his breathing.
Oh.
Well, why don't you keep my afghan till next year?
I'm, uh-
- I'm traveling light.
Traveling?
The green-winged teals are flying soon.
Oh, so soon?
At least I know you're all right.
Oh, I'm fit as a--
[ Coughs, Sneezes ]
Excuse me.
Damn!
[ Coughing ]
Maurice, have you spent a lot of time around mohair?
Well, the only experience I can recall... was my-my mama knitted me a mohair sweater when I was around 1 0 years old.
And when you put it on, do you recall having any reaction to it?
I think I went into a three-day coma.
From now on, stick to cashmere.
You have what is called a severe allergy.
You mean, if we get rid of this damn blanket, we can--
Absolutely.
Happy landings.
[ Chuckles ] Nice look.
Very homey.
Nice.
Very nice.
Nice decor.
I like your style.
I'm sorry.
I thought you'd be on your--
Well, it's just a few touches so I'd feel more--
I mean, I'll clear them all away if you ever--
I mean, when you--
- Forget it.
- I didn't throw any of your stuff away.
- You are a prince, Ginsberg.
A real mensch.
- Thanks.
- I wish you naches.
- Oh, thanks.
Naches is one of those words-- I mean, you always hear, but you never really know exactly what it means.
Does anyone really know?
Do you, Ginsberg?
Well, happiness, luck.
Uh-huh.
It actually dates from the 12th century, when, uh, naches... were the spice cakes they gave travelers--
All right, all right!
I mean, you're not really Gilmore.
Look, I know how much you like it here and how great everyone thinks you are, but, uh, there's been a change of plans.
A change?
Yeah, yeah.
I don't know how to spring this on you, but we've run into a little scheduling problem.
Scheduling?
So it's been a pleasure to meet you, Dave.
Wait!
I'm only sorry you couldn't stay longer, but--
Look, I'm sure there's a doctor in Yellowknife or somethin' who'll need a substitute.
Okay?
Well, take care.
If you find yourself in Cicely, don't be a stranger.
Joel, I don't understand.
I--
Bye, Dave.
[ Knocking ] Joel?
Joel.!
[ Knocking Continues ]
[ Tlingit ]
[ Coughing ]
Did you knock?
Uh, I was getting around to it.
How long have you been standing out there?
Not long.
Five, 1 0 minutes.
You wanna come in?
So-
- Huh.
""Huh" what?
Well, I've never just, you know, visited you before, you know?
I mean, socially.
Oh.
Look, uh, I don't wanna get too personal or anything, but is there like some reason you were so concerned with my safety?
I mean, it's not like you and I are-- No.
- We've never--
- God, no.
So why are you having these dreams about me?
I don't know.
Can I suggest an explanation?
No.
Come on, O'Connell.
just admit that once, in your heart ofhearts, you have had feelings for me.
Well, I-- Not feelings, Fleischman.
I wouldn't qualify them as feelings.
They're more like occasional... thoughts.
Thoughts?
Yeah, you know, thoughts.
Yeah, okay.
You've had thoughts about me.
Or maybe more like impulses.
Impulses?
No, thoughts.
What do you mean, thought-type thoughts or fantasy-type thoughts?
Can we change the subject?
Yeah, sure.
No problem.
Well, what was I wearing?
All right.
Come on, O'Connell.
just admit you don't want me to go.
I never said that.
You want me to take that plane?
Why are you doing this, Fleischman?
Tell me to take that doomed flight, and I will.
Well?
Oh, what the hell.
Don't think I'm doing this because I'm superstitious.
I'm not.
It's just I don't feel right about leaving my patients with that quack Ginsberg.
Good night.
?
[Jazz ]
[ Sinead O'Connor] ?
You do ?
?
Something to me ?
?
Something that simply mystifies me?
?
Tell me?
?
Why should it be?
?
You have the power?
?
To hypnotize me?
You know what I think?
I think they did it together.
I mean, they both really hated his guts.
I bet you anything... they were in cahoots from the beginning.
Professor Plum and Mrs. White?
Well, yeah.
Sometimes, they get stuck together.
I once had to pry Colonel Mustard off of Mrs. Peacock's back.
Three cards, O'Connell- location, weapon and murderer.
One murderer.
It's after 10:00.
I gotta go.
I can see every card in your hand.
- So, don't look.
- I can't help it.
How about turning up the heat, O'Connell?
I'm freezing.
Can I wear this?
Oh, I don't think you should.
What?
Rick's gonna mind?
No, it's not his.
So, what's the big deal?
Go, already.
I'm gonna miss my plane.
Well, we both know it's the library.
This is stupid, O'Connell.
You can't play the game of Clue with two people.
It is obviously Colonel Mustard with the candlestick in the library.
Now, can we leave?
Please?
Oh, I don't want you to go.
Stay.
Stay.
Stay.
NORTHERN EXPOSURE
2x04 "WHAT I DID FOR LOVE" Subtitles subXpacio
Give me something really, really stupid.
I don't think we have anything that stupid, Dr. Fleischman.
Well, then give me something really touristy.
How about some willow ptarmigan candies?
It's the state bird, so it's good for tourists.
And it's marzipan, so it's nice and filling.
Great.
I'll take three boxes.
Okay.
One each for your folks, and one for-
Now, isn't that a nice thought?
I wouldn't be surprised if she took you back.
It's not for Elaine.
It's for- Uh-huh.
You know- I have a lot of friends in New York.
Friends from med school, friends from college, friends from-from Bronx Science.
I'm still in touch with Richie Marx.
We had our bar mitzvah together.
It was a Temple Beth Shalom double bill.
Yeah.
He's gonna get us tickets to, uh, Sinead O'Connor.
She's playing the Palladium.
Oh, great.
I don't even know if I can pack it all into two weeks.
When you come right down to it, what's the point of comin' back here at all?
You'll get thrown in the slammer for breach of contract.
Okay.
There's a point.
Morning, Maggie.
Hi.
- Hello, O'Connell.
- Hi.
Your chair's out back.
That's a heavy old thing.
I had to help the guy lug it off the truck.
Thanks, thanks.
Just stocking' up for my little trip back to the Big Apple.
I'm goin' bullish on ptarmigans.
Care for a box as a memento?
Bite a ptarmigan's head off, you'll be flooded with memories of me.
Mmm, no, thanks.
Um, I'll just go get the truck.
- You better get Rick to give you a hand.
- Oh, I can't.
He's in the Aleutians.
- I'll give you a hand.
- You will?
Sure.
Why not?
Is this a dirty trick, Fleischman?
What, like a practical joke?
Like, I'm... gonna help you with the chair and drop it on your foot?
- Yeah.
- Absolutely not.
Well, thanks, Fleischman.
That's, uh-
That's-That's sweet.
Oh, I appreciate it, I do.
It's just that I have this Pavlovian response to you, and I can never really express my appreciation.
To you, that is, because you're sneaky and duplicitous and self-serving, and I always think you have a hidden agenda.
You're welcome.
Be back in five minutes for the marzipan.
Okay, Joel.
I'll get 'em wrapped up for you.
Trapped as we are on that merry-go-round of time, we've circled around once again to the annual Cicely, Alaska... birthday bash extravaganza.
That's right.
Tomorrow's Founder's Day, when we all get together out at the church and mark that special day back in 1932... when Cicely and Roslyn stalled out here on the cusp of the new Alaskan Riviera... and had to make the best of a bad situation.
That's a damn lie.
Now, nobody really knows for sure what happened... in that stalled car out in the woods... with Cicely and her very special friend Roslyn.
Damn it!
I told him to lay off that lesbian angle!
All alone, a little homesick, couple of slugs out of Roslyn's hip flask.
One thing leads to another.
Hey, come on.
We've all seen Cicely's picture.
Sure, she's a little heavy-set, on the jowly side, but very attractive in a Margaret Thatcher kind of way.
It's not an angle, Maurice.
Cicely and Roslyn loved each other deeply.
That's why they came to Alaska in the first place.
They couldn't find acceptance in polite Billings society.
Well, why in the hell did they have to find it here?
I've got nothing against Sapphic love.
I've been to some erotic movies myself.
But why hold up Hecate and Persephone and whoever to the rest of the world and say,
"Hey, look, folks.
This is what we're all about"?
You get into areas of attraction, and we're talkin' serious mystery here.
Shh!
This is it.
And while we are talking mystery, the Video Society continues Death and Devastation Month... this Wednesday at Ruth-Anne's library.
Tonight's selection, Pile-Up On Highway 10, is on loan from the private collection of Ed.
Well, guess that was my 15 minutes.
Ingrid!
Is it April already?
Time does fly.
Seems like I just left, doesn't it?
Yeah.
Hi, Ed.
I heard your name on the radio just now.
Oh, thanks!
- You're looking well, Ingrid.
- Well, you're looking good yourself, Maurice.
Your squeeze off on the ice again?
Yeah.
The snowshoe hare population's up eight percent.
Doesn't he freeze out there in just that itty-bitty pup tent?
He doesn't even notice it.
From now until the end of tagging season, he thinks about nothing but hares, hares, hares.
I can dig it.
Such a help.
Watch-Watch the legs.
This way.
This way.
This way.
This way.
Thank you.
What is this thing made of, melted-down anvils?
Oh, great, Fleischman.
My records!
I hope you take better care of your airplane.
They were in alphabetical order.
Very classy, O'Connell.
Cole Porter.
You ever hear Sinead O'Connor sing "You Do Something To Me"?
It's fantastic.
All right, where do you want this thing?
Over there in the corner, please.
Ah, yes.
Under the memorial shrines.
I think scrapbooks are cliché.
Huh.
How many boyfriends have you lost?
Four.
This is definitely original.
No, I'm serious.
Well, I used to have candles, but I worried that they'd burn the dioramas.
A lot of those figurines are crayons.
Crayons?
Yeah, I melt them down, pour them into molds.
Then after they cool off, I put on their little outfits.
Where'd you pick up the plastic sushi?
Sitka.
Harry's is the worst.
I mean, no matter what I do, talcum powder does not look like snow.
But Roy's is good, though.
He loved those California rolls.
Why do they all have these little black polka dots all over them?
Those are the black fedoras.
The black fedoras?
Yeah, symbolizing- Well, you know.
Death?
Right.
And what does the glued-on macaroni symbolize?
Man's inhumanity to man?
Nothing, Fleischman.
They symbolize nothing.
They're macaroni.
What are you gonna do for Rick, a toy plane and a tiny Soloflex machine?
Very amusing.
Now, just put the chair by the sushi.
You're amazing.
Incredible.
Spectacular.
Better than the Buzzer?
I know, I know.
I wouldn't want you to talk about me to them.
Oh, you're the one with the privacy fetish.
No dining out, no strolling through town.
I've got your reputation to protect.
Girl like you, small town like this-
You could be ruined in a week if tongues started wagging.
You're sweet.
Very sweet.
As sweet as Johnno?
Maurice, you're so silly.
Oh, I bet he's great in the sack, huh?
Unimaginative, but very, very dependable.
A missionary man all the way.
Am I right?
What if I don't tell you?
What if I make you?
I've got something that'll break down those defenses.
What are you doing?
Maurice!
Oh, no.
Again?
You devil!
You bad, bad man.
Five.
Four.
Three.
Two.
One.
Oh, Maurice.
Ignition.
We have liftoff.
Oh, my God!
One, two, three, four.
Sorry I'm late.
Your move, Mr. - Streisand.
Your move, Mr. Streisand.
Ah!
Let's not tell him about the Anchorage-New York plane crash.
If he finds out he's dead, the evening'll be a total drag.
Isn't she lovely?
Maggie?
Miss Scarlet.
Gilliam, I don't care whether you like it or- Well, that was fast.
Oh.
I'm surprised that there's someone in New York who-
No, I've never heard of a Dr. David Ginsberg.
Ginsberg.
Jewish.
This may come as a shock to you, but not every Jew in New York... knows every other Jew in New York.
We're not like the-the Masons.
We don't have a secret handshake.
No, not the Masons.
The Freemasons.
Look, forget I mentioned- Okay, fine.
I will look forward to seeing his face.
Oh, boy.
The substitute New York Jewish doctor.
I know the type.
You do?
You bet your mukluks I do.
Dr. David Ginsberg.
B.A., City College, M.D., Columbia University.
Do I know guys like him?
I am guys like him.
He's gonna love Cicely, Alaska.
- Hello.
I'd like to see the doctor.
- That's him.
Can I help you?
May I speak to you a moment in private?
Sure.
Have I seen you before, Ms. -
Klochner.
No, I'm just passing through.
It's Ben's week to tag snowshoe hares.
Sounds thrilling.
Who's Ben?
- My husband.
- Oh.
Okay.
Well, what seems to be your, uh, problem?
Oh, it's not me.
It's Maurice.
Maurice?
Maurice Minnifield?
Last night in the middle of the night,
- ...he was snoring away
- Wait, wait.
Wait.
Excuse me, Mrs. Klochner.
I mean, I don't mean to be invasive or anything, but- just to make sure I'm totally clear on this - we are talking about...
- ...the same Maurice Minnifield?
- Yes, the astronaut.
All right.
I just wanted to be clear.
Well, I was fast asleep when his snoring woke me up.
Actually, I'm-I'm quite used to Maurice's snoring.
I've come to expect it.
In an odd way, even to depend on it.
It's so- Well, you know, it's so Maurice.
Anyway, I came awake with a start, and I glanced over at Maurice... who not only had stopped snoring, but was no longer breathing.
- Wait a minute.
Maurice stopped breathing?
- Just like that.
If I hadn't been there to shake the air out of him,
I'm afraid to think what might have happened.
Now, Mrs. Klochner,
I realize that this is-is- it's none of my business, but, I mean, just to put this into some sort of medical perspective, um, have-have there been other occasions... where you noticed this sleep disorder?
Oh, yes.
But it was the first time he ever actually stopped breathing.
Huh.
Okay, um-
Well, tell Maurice to come in and see me.
Impossible.
He refuses to see a doctor.
I know it's a lot to ask, but, um, would you talk to him for me?
Sure.
There's a condition called sleep apnea, which is unusual in adults, actually.
Uh, you stop breathing, and then after a little while you start up again.
Is it fatal?
Only if you don't start up again.
Now, all kinds of people love all kinds of people.
None of it makes any sense, but when you get right down to it, love just doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
I'll tell you why.
Half the time, you're either tramplin' on somebody's heart, or half the time it's your heart that's got the footprints.
Now, usually it's another man or woman who does the trampling.
But in the case of our beloved founders, Cicely and Roslyn, it was that two-fisted cross-dresser Mortality who did the damage.
Chris?
Hi.
I was just, uh, practicing my Founder's Day sermon.
I don't know.
Maybe I should play up that "hardy spinster" thing.
So I guess this is a bad time, huh?
No, no.
No.
I need a break.
Come in.
What's up?
Well, I feel really stupid asking you this, but, uh, well, if a person has a- a premonition that this other person's going to die, but you're not really close to that someone or anything,
is it the premonitioner's moral obligation to warn the premonitionee?
Hmm.
Depends on the nature of the premonition.
I mean, is it a... cold chill racing up and down the spine, or something more definite?
It's a dream.
A recurring dream.
Fleischman and I are playing Clue, and he's wearing this black fedora.
A black fedora?
- Uh-huh.
- Oh, man.
I've really gotten to like Joel.
What does that mean?
Maggie, come on.
I mean, your history with men bein' what it is.
And a black fedora?
How's it happen?
The flight from Anchorage to New York.
No!
The whole plane goes down?
Mm-hmm.
I mean, I feel like I have to warn him.
- Don't I?
- Yes, I think so.
I mean, if you don't and he goes down in that plane, you gotta live with that for the rest of your life.
I know.
On the other hand, what if you tell him... and the plane that he changes to turns out to be the one that crashes?
Oh, God.
I didn't even think of that.
Oh, yeah.
This fate thing can be a tricky business.
We may have been fated to have this conversation... and then decide whatever we decide.
So-So you mean whatever my decision is, that's the thing that's gonna kill him?
It could be.
I mean, we're assuming that you have free will, and that's not really that safe an assumption.
So I-I should make a decision, and then do the opposite thing really fast?
Yes.
But you were probably fated to do that.
She told you?
Maurice, she was worried about you.
You'd better zip your lip, boy.
Now, if you say one word that tarnishes the reputation of that little lady, you will have to answer to me.
I will carry her secret to my grave.
Sure.
Sexual promiscuity is de rigueur for rock stars.
But do you have any idea- any idea- of the amount of tail that astronauts have to contend with?
No, I-I don't.
A lot.
Now, yours truly usually refrained from dipping his wick into the oil lamp, but Ingrid was one groupie that I never had the wherewithal to say no to.
Mrs. Klochner is an astronaut groupie?
Some women, when they see a man brave enough to blast off... into the darkness of infinity in a Thinsulite suit-
A lot of women get excited.
Excited, maybe.
Excited, okay.
But-But this is way beyond excited.
This is
- This is-
This is really excited.
Look, Maurice, the only way for me to see if you have sleep apnea is to watch you sleep.
- No, sir.
No way.
- But, Maurice-
Do you think that I'm gonna lie there, sleeping like a baby, while you're crawling all over me?
I just wanna check your breathing.
Yeah, and look in my ears and shine a light up my nose and God knows what else.
And I won't be able to do a damn thing about it.
How would you like it if I watched you sleep?
- I wouldn't, but-
- Good.
It's kinky.
Case closed.
There.
You see?
It's moving.
You did it.
You fixed it.
Give a man a set of combination wrenches, and he can fix anything.
Just one more little tweak.
That's got it.
- Is that beautiful or what?
- Beautiful?
Try late.
I put a call into someone somewhere six weeks ago.
Where'd you walk in from, Nome?
New York.
Red-eye from Kennedy.
Serious nightmare.
They showed Marked For Death.
You're my replacement?
You're Dr. Ginsberg?
Oh, please.
I can't handle this "Doctor" stuff.
He likes to be called Dave.
I hope you don't mind.
I, uh, took a look around the office.
Well, it came furnished.
I didn't have to touch a thing.
I can see that.
You know, usually I turn down these substitute gigs.
I mean, hey, say what you will about New York, but I see a lot of variety in my practice.
I can't complain.
But when they said Alaska-
I mean, we're talkin' serious wilderness here.
Am I right?
We're talkin' unspoiled beauty.
We're talkin' a city boy's dream come true... for two fabulous weeks.
You're actually looking forward to your stay here?
- Oh, you bet.
- Where you from in New York?
- Flushing.
- Flushing?
- You know Flushing?
- Yeah, I'm from Flushing. 139th and Main.
- By the Long Island Railroad.
- Right.
How about that?
Small world.
Huh.
Well, I'll just- I'll get this stuff out of your way.
I'll just toss it all in the, uh-
I'm gonna get this Tlingit language down if it's the last thing I do.
Dr. Fleischman, is Dave still in there?
- Yeah, yeah, Dave's still in there.
- Oh, good.
Hey, Ed.
What do you think about this Dave, anyway?
- Oh, he's nice.
- Yeah?
You base that conclusion on what?
His niceness.
Plus, he's an excellent doctor.
- Yeah?
How do you know that?
- Well, he's Jewish, and he's from New York.
That Dave, Jewish?
Give me a break.
The man's got no pigmentation.
His roots are blond.
- Scandinavian?
- His hair roots.
The guy's a Jewish impostor, Ed.
Some goyish overachiever who changed his name from Gilmore to Ginsberg to get credibility.
Jewish!
Give me a break.
What Jew who looks like that fixes heaters?
- Michael Landon.
- Michael Landon's Jewish?
- Little Joe?
You gotta be kidding me.
- Nope.
Well, I'm tellin' you, Ginsberg's not.
Hey, what do I care?
I'm outta here in two days.
Oh, you.
- I thought you'd be inside.
- Dave's inside.
Uh, I better go see him while he's still there.
See ya.
What's up, O'Connell?
Look, uh, I know you've got a plane to catch in Anchorage on Saturday, and I know I'm supposed to fly you there, but I have this errand...
I have to run Saturday afternoon, and by the time I'm finished we'll be really late.
So I'm really sorry, but you'll have to change your flight.
Okay?
Thanks.
What are you talking about?
Change my flight?
- I've been planning this trip for weeks.
- Sorry.
You have an errand?
You have an errand?
What errand?
It's personal.
It's a personal errand.
What, you have to pick up your dry cleaning?
You're lyin', O'Connell.
You're just tryin' to weasel out of an agreement.
There's no errand.
You just don't wanna take me to Anchorage.
Hey, I spent the last four months living for this vacation.
- I know.
I know.
- So?
It's just I keep having this stupid dream about your plane crashing.
- What?
- You heard me.
You wanna cancel my trip because you dreamed my plane crashed?
Yes.
No.
You died.
Oh.
- You dreamt about me?
- On several occasions.
You're
- So you're worried about me?
Concerned, Fleischman.
I'm concerned.
You know, the kind of generic, impersonal concern you have for any living creature.
- I'm touched.
- Oh, please.
No, I am- Hey, I really am.
You're an unbelievable egomaniac.
You know that, Fleischman?
- You really are worried about me.
- Fine.
Fine.
You wanna turn this into some sop for your male vanity, go ahead.
But I have warned you, and your life is in your hands now.
As opposed to whose?
Yours?
Well, now, this time of year, the best place is the Ugamak Pass.
Tuck your tent into a drift, you got shelter on three sides, stars close enough to touch.
- Build a little fire.
- You sit quiet enough, the elk'll come out to watch the light.
I saw four in one night.
Killed every last one of' em.
Mazel tov.
He's got antlers up the wazoo.
You wouldn't maybe feel like blowin' a couple of moose away this weekend, would you?
- I mean, you and me?
- Thank you, Dave.
But, uh, a few years ago, I started seein' things through elk eyes.
Now the only thing I shoot wildlife with is Fujifilm.
Oh.
Right.
- Dr. Fleischman?
-Ed?
Two mooseburgers, medium well.
- Thank you, Shelly.
- Welcome.
Now I've lost my train of thought.
You said, "Dr. Fleischman."
Oh, right.
Dr. Fleischman?
Ed?
Um, do you like me?
- Of course I like you.
- Oh, good.
So you'll sell your plane ticket then.
Well, I don't like you that much.
Ed, I don't like anyone that much.
I'm goin' to New York.
I'm not changing my plans because of some facockta dream.
But you were at the Video Society.
You saw It's A Wonderful Life.
- Yeah?
So?
- So, don't you remember?
Jimmy Stewart thought he'd wasted his whole life.
Then he saw the effect he'd had on other people's lives around him.
I mean, just imagine what this town would be like without you.
Can you imagine that, Dr. Fleischman?
Imagine.
I mean, just imagine.
"I'm as corny as Kansas in August"
"High as a flag on the 4th of July"
"If you'll excuse an expression I use"
"I'm in love, I'm in love I'm in love, I'm in love"
"I'm in love with a wonderful guy"
Thanks, Maurice.
I think it's time to propose a toast... to a little lady who means an awful lot to me.
I think you know exactly who I'm talking about.
Oh.
Yes.
Thanks.
Ah!
You're so good to me, Maurice.
It's just that, um-
What?
What are you trying to say, Ingrid?
I think maybe I should stay in town tonight.
T
- T-Tonight?
You mean, the whole night?
Yes.
Ingrid, you know I'm better in the morning.
This was just a-a prelude, a- a preliminary to the main event.
I just don't feel right about-
Because I wasn't the first to ride the top of that rocket?
My God, Ingrid, I'm not Shepard.
Don't you think I spend my whole life thinking,
"Why Al?
Why Al?
Why Al?"
Maurice, this has nothing to do with- All right, I'm-I'm second string.
Grissom took his ride before me.
Go ahead, say it.
I'm second string.
Maurice, it's not about flying.
You stopped breathing last night.
And you think Schirra never paused in his breathing?
Think again.
- I'm just worried that you might-
- Might what?
I'm worried you might die.
Now, hold the phone, now.
I do start breathing again, don't I?
So far.
As to the psycho-sexual bent of our founders, let's just say that they were very, very close.
I mean, they had a good thing, they were lucky to have it, and we were lucky to have them.
Cicely and Roslyn created the place that we call home, sweet home, so remember them however you like.
They won't mind.
They're dead.
But, folks, please, do remember them.
And while our mental gears are shifted into memory,
I'd like to call a little attention to a fella... that we've gotten pretty attached to here the last few months.
A guy that we refer to as Dr. Fleischman.
Well, he just might go away for two weeks.
Well, how many people know about Maggie's dream?
Wow.
Oh, my-
Shelly!
They pried it out of me.
Okay, all right, sure, he can come back.
And, uh, true, even if he doesn't, we still have Dave.
But I'd like to take a little time now... to-to pay our respects to Joel while we know we still can.
Anyone?
Ruth-Anne?
When I remember Dr. Fleischman, I- Wait a minute!
She has one stupid dream, and-and that's it?
I'm history?
Well, Joel, you were wearing the fedora.
Well, I-I just think that Dr. Fleischman is a fine doctor and a very interesting person.
And I feel really bad about Elaine breaking up with him.
I can't help but think had she known about the plane wreck, she might have gone ahead and waited until he was dead.
I think that would have been the tactful way to handle it.
Marilyn?
He taught me how to use the hold button.
I always wanted to be at my own funeral.
This way, you can see what people thought about you.
Anyone else?
Shelly?
Dr. Fleischman is sweet and kind and gentle and honest.
He's a good doctor.
And he was a real friend to me when I thought I was pregnant... and when I discovered I wasn't.
And besides all that, he's ethnic, which is kind of cool.
- And he's cute.
- Cute?
Yeah?
You think so?
- Very cute.
- Wouldn't go that far.
- I would.
- I find him attractive.
All I'm saying is, I can see why Maggie's had dreams about him.
Dream.
Singular.
One dream!
Hey, you stop lookin' at me like that.
Look, you guys are the ones that said he was cute.
I never said he was cute!
You know, I've been having some serious thoughts lately... about that winged chariot - time.
Sooner or later, it sweeps us all away.
I know that, Maurice.
Well, this boy might be swept away tomorrow.
He might go off on that rocket ship to the hereafter.
A man likes sweet words from a woman when he's about to go into the beyond.
It bucks him up.
All right, have it your own way!
But, remember, you may never see him again.
"I'm a little teapot, short and stout"
"Here is my handle Here is my spout"
"When I get all steamed up"
"Then I shout"
"Just tip me over and pour me out"
All right.
Okay.
Oh, sorry.
I was just cheering them up after their tetanus boosters.
Well, don't stop anything on account of me.
Oh.
That's okay.
It's almost dinnertime.
This is Grandpa Jim.
He's dead.
Oh.
Well, he-he looks very nice.
If you see him, tell him Grandma's only marrying Mr. Skinner for his microwave.
Well, Joel, I've gotta hit the road too.
I just dropped by for a sec to bring some oatmeal cookies that I baked for Dave.
Mmm, oatmeal.
My favorite.
You baked him oatmeal cookies?
Mm-hmm.
Bye, Dave.
Bye.
I brought you something.
What-What are you trying to tell me?
I should paddle to New York?
It's to ease your journey to the other side.
Okay.
Okay.
You win.
I'm spooked.
I admit it.
I am officially unsettled.
I give up.
It's not worth it.
I have my pride, but I'll be damned if I'm gonna die for it.
What'd the airline say?
Can I use my frequent flyer ticket for the 6:00 a. m. flight?
It's a extra $600.
$600?
Yeah, over my dead body.
Okay, damn it.
Watch me sleep.
- Huh?
- All that stuff I was sayin;..
about winged chariots got to me.
It was creepy, and damned moving.
And I decided if it was that important to...
- Well, you know who I'm talking about.
You can check me for sleep whats is tonight.
Are we talking, uh, sleep apnea here?
- Yeah.
- I did a study on sleep apnea.
It's sort of a hobby of mine.
You know, it's often a misdiagnosis-
Forget it, Ginsberg.
Maurice is my patient.
I'll make his diagnosis.
"All at once he was through max G,"
"as if through a turbulent straight, and the trajectory was smooth,2
"and he was supersonic, and the pressure in his chest reached six G's."
I mean, Proust, Henry James, those guys could put me to sleep.
- But The Right Stuff?
.
- Shh!
This is the best part coming up here.
"The rocket pitched down, and in a moment, there it was."
"And his body slammed forward as if it were screeching to a halt."
Look, I hate to spoil the slumber party, but, this stuff's gonna give me nightmares.
Can we just skip to the stuff about Sally Rand and the striptease?
All right, Ingrid.
The boy's gettin' antsy.
Go ahead.
Leave us alone.
I'm primed.
Good night, Maurice.
I'll be in the guest room if you need me.
Good night, Ingrid.
Joel, there goes a fine woman.
I guess it's kind of cornball, me goin' on and on like this about her.
No.
Actually, it's kind of sweet.
- Sweet?
- Yeah.
Joel... we're talkin' sex here, pure and simple.
Now, it may be a lot of things, but, uh, it's not sweet.
What Ingrid and I have is, uh, comparable to a fully-loaded X-15... firing at 57,000 pounds of thrust.
You may not understand that now, but when you get to be an old bear like me, you will.
Oops.
Sorry.
Forgot about the crash.
That was tactless of me.
But, you know, in a way, Joel,
I envy you your demise.
- You envy my dying?
- Yeah.
Well, it comes to all of us, son.
You know what my greatest fear is?
Slipping in the shower.
Having a heart attack sitting on the john.
Sleep apnea.
Goin' out with a whimper instead of a bang.
You know, Fleischman, in a lot of ways,
- ...you're lucky.
- Lucky?
You'll be sailing along peacefully.
Then all of a sudden, wham!
You're pinned back against your seat, wind screaming in your ears,
cold air everywhere, glass shattering, darkness coming at you from all directions.
And then... oblivion.
Nothing but ice, more ice.
As far as the eye can see, just ice.
- Ice.
- Sure.
Must be the polar route.
I'll tell you a secret.
I had some strong reservations about getting on this plane.
- No kidding?
- Do you believe in fate?
Predestination?
No.
I'm an existentialist.
Me too.
Well, really more like a rational humanist.
Sweetheart, what's important is the here and the now.
People should learn to relax and take life as it comes.
Hey, I like your philosophy, Mrs. -
- Streisand.
- Streisand?
Wait.
Where-Where have I heard that name before?
Wait a minute.
You're not-
We're related by marriage, hon, not by blood.
Oh.
Let me buy you a drink, Mrs. Streisand.
- Sure.
- Stewardess?
- Hey, O'Connell.
- Champagne?
You'll be needing this.
- Hey, what's that thing on your back?
- Parachute.
Wait.
Flight attendants aren't supposed to wear parachutes.
How do you think the passengers feel-
- O'Connell-
- Bon voyage, Fleischman.
Now, there's a lovely girl.
Bon voyage!
Joel?
Joel?
Look alive, son.
My back.
So, how's my sleep apnea?
You don't have it.
I watched you for six hours.
Your breathing is perfectly regular.
Hey.
No kiddin'?
- Ingrid!
- Is, um
- Is he all right?
He's fine.
There's nothing wrong with his breathing.
Oh.
Well, why don't you keep my afghan till next year?
I'm, uh
- I'm traveling light.
Traveling?
The green-winged teals are flying soon.
Oh, so soon?
At least I know you're all right.
Oh, I'm fit as a-
Excuse me.
Damn!
Maurice, have you spent a lot of time around mohair?
Well, the only experience I can recall... was my-my mama knitted me a mohair sweater when I was around 10 years old.
And when you put it on, do you recall having any reaction to it?
I think I went into a three-day coma.
From now on, stick to cashmere.
You have what is called a severe allergy.
You mean, if we get rid of this damn blanket, we can-
Absolutely.
Happy landings.
Nice look.
Very homey.
Nice.
Very nice.
Nice decor.
I like your style.
I'm sorry.
I thought you'd be on your-
Well, it's just a few touches so I'd feel more-
I mean, I'll clear them all away if you ever-
I mean, when you-
- Forget it.
- I didn't throw any of your stuff away.
- You are a prince, Ginsberg.
A real mensch.
- Thanks.
- I wish you naches.
- Oh, thanks.
Naches is one of those words- I mean, you always hear, but you never really know exactly what it means.
Does anyone really know?
Do you, Ginsberg?
- Well, happiness, luck.
- Uh-huh.
It actually dates from the 12th century, when, uh, naches... were the spice cakes they gave travelers-
All right, all right!
I mean, you're not really Gilmore.
Look, I know how much you like it here and how great everyone thinks you are, but, uh, there's been a change of plans.
- A change?
- Yeah, yeah.
I don't know how to spring this on you, but we've run into a little scheduling problem.
- So it's been a pleasure to meet you, Dave.
- Scheduling?
Wait!
- I'm only sorry you couldn't stay longer, but-
- Wait, wait.
Look,
I'm sure there's a doctor in Yellowknife or somethin' who'll need a substitute.
Okay?
Well, take care.
If you find yourself in Cicely,
- ...don't be a stranger.
- Joel, I don't understand.
I-
Bye, Dave.
Joel?
Joel!
- Did you knock?
- Uh, I was getting around to it.
How long have you been standing out there?
Not long.
Five, 10 minutes.
You wanna come in?
So
- Huh.
- "Huh" what?
- Well, I've never just, you know, visited you before, you know?
- I mean, socially.
- Oh.
Look, uh, I don't wanna get too personal or anything, but... is there like some reason you were so concerned with my safety?
- I mean, it's not like you and I are
- No.
- We've never-
- God, no.
So why are you having these dreams about me?
I don't know.
Can I suggest an explanation?
- No.
- Come on, O'Connell.
Just admit that once, in your heart of hearts, you have had feelings for me.
Well, I- Not feelings, Fleischman.
I wouldn't qualify them as feelings.
They're more like occasional... thoughts.
- Thoughts?
- Yeah, you know, thoughts.
Yeah, okay.
You've had thoughts about me.
Or maybe more like impulses.
- Impulses?
- No, thoughts.
What do you mean, thought-type thoughts or fantasy-type thoughts?
- Can we change the subject?
- Yeah, sure.
No problem.
Well, what was I wearing?
- All right.
- Come on, O'Connell.
- Just admit you don't want me to go.
- I never said that.
- You want me to take that plane?
- Why are you doing this, Fleischman?
Tell me to take that doomed flight, and I will.
Well?
Oh, what the hell.
Don't think I'm doing this because I'm superstitious.
I'm not.
It's just I don't feel right about leaving my patients with that quack Ginsberg.
Good night.
"You do"
"Something to me"
"Something that simply mystifies me"
"Tell me"
"Why should it be"
"You have the power"

Don't move a muscle, or I'll come back in there.
Freeze!
Drop your weapon.
Harry, you again?
Come on.
How many times we gotta do this, huh?
You're a bad boy, Harry.
Use a gun, go to prison.
- You guys need any help?
- Hey, it's all right.
We got him.
We're old buddies.
Come on, you know the routine.
Hands behind you.
Come on.
- Another rough night, Murph?
- Oh, boy.
Three days without sleep.
I even tried what you suggested.
You know, counting sheep.
Last night at dawn, I had 2300.
You counted 2300 sheep?
Well, actually, I counted their legs and divided by four.
Boy, maybe I should ask him what his secret is.
He's not asleep, Murph.
- Well, you can do the honors.
- Thank you.
So, what's he so happy about, huh?
No rigor.
Poor Harry.
- You know this guy?
- Only by reputation.
As a not particularly gifted B-and-E and stickup man.
Did go to school with his cousin.
What did he die of?
Beats me.
They just brought him in.
I'm taking him off to the pathologist for slice and dice.
Hold it.
It looks like the kind of thing some doctors prescribe for their patients to induce endorphins.
Helps people quit smoking.
Think it worked on Harry?
Oh, gotta go upstairs.
Do me a favor and close him up when you're through, huh?
You got it.
Well rest in peace, Harry.
Come on.
Oh, come on.
Come on.
Harry, wake up.
- Roger, I was just dreaming about you.
- Listen, we gotta be really quiet.
I was dreaming...
I was dreaming that I was trying to pick the lock at the Taj Mahal.
And then...
And then...
- Man, I've been shrink-wrapped.
- We gotta get out of here before someone comes in.
Here.
Put this on.
Come on.
Put this on.
Come on.
It worked.
Roger, it worked.
- You're a genius!
- Yeah, well, maybe.
This thing that put me to sleep, that's the key.
All you gotta do is make it bigger.
We could sing our own lullaby to this whole city.
Come on.
Look, this has been going on for three weeks, all right?
My credit rating is ruined.
I'm being hounded by collection agencies.
No, you listen to me.
This is Barry Patrick Allen from Central City, not to be confused with that deadbeat Barry Peter Allen from Centerville.
You'll get back to me?
But...
Hello?
Damn!
I don't believe these people.
- Financial hell week, eh?
- May they strangle in their own red tape.
Well, Garfield's on his way up with a guy from Internal Affairs who wants a look at our recent files.
- Our recent files aren't filed.
Yeah, and we're also behind on that stack of evidence-analysis requests.
- I thought you were...
- I would have but I had this emergency DNA profile for Homicide.
Which I have to hand-carry downtown right now.
Good luck.
You'll pay for this.
Okay.
Lieutenant.
Just catching up on some work.
Good.
This is Jack Farrow from Internal Affairs.
How do you do?
We got a problem with the Harry Milgrim case.
Harry Milgrim.
Got the file right over here.
- Milgrim's gone.
- Oh, yeah, I know.
It's too bad, isn't it?
In spite of the fact that he really was a...
No, I mean, he's gone.
- Gone?
- His body disappeared last night.
- Well, what happened to it?
- Oh, that's a good question.
A man dies in custody, the department is responsible.
But we don't even know what killed this guy.
Well, he's bound to turn up.
- Isn't he?
- You were the last person signed in to see him.
- It's not like he was going anywhere.
Well, something happened, didn't it?
I'll expect to hear from you on this soon.
What did the morgue say?
The attendant on duty is like a monkey with its paws over its face.
Didn't hear anything, see anything.
Just says you were the last to see Milgrim.
There's something else I need to talk to you about.
Personnel got a letter from a credit company about your debt.
- They want to attach your wages.
- Well, it's a mistake, lieutenant.
- It's some kind of computer error.
- Well, that's good.
Try to clear it up.
It looks bad.
And I need you to look into this Milgrim business and notify the next of kin that the remains were misplaced.
- But, sir...
- Today.
Farrow wants to climb the career ladder by stepping on my back.
Help me get him off.
Did I look that dead?
Yes, absolutely.
Vital signs so slow they mimic death.
Do you know how much money we're going to make off of this?
Sure.
Just think of what you can do with it.
Long space voyages, life extension.
Right, right.
But first things first.
Research requires funds, am I right?
- You're right, Harry, but this...
- But nothing.
Did you ever have any luck with any of those grants you applied for?
Anybody ever listen to you at a university or a corporation?
- No, Harry.
- Who cares about you?
- You do, Harry.
- Right.
But we can make a legitimate business out of the sleep inducer.
Don't even think about that now, coz.
You never had any problem accepting money from those other jobs we did.
And just remember one thing.
You are in as deep as I am.
If I go down, you go down.
I know.
Yeah, so stop griping.
This thing, it's gonna make us big.
All you gotta do is lay back and enjoy the ride.
- Yes?
- Roger.
It's Barry Allen.
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Sure.
Up the stairs, first door on your right.
Just get in here.
- Hi.
- Hi.
- I don't think you remember me.
- Barry Allen from Central High?
Yeah, yeah.
We spoke for a couple minutes at the 10th reunion.
I remember you.
We were in Science Club together.
Well still at it, I see.
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, what's this?
Oh, it's, you know, nothing important really.
You know, just some stuff.
Rog, I think your mice have had it.
Yeah.
Well, nobody lives forever, right?
That's...
That's a combination wiper-defroster unit.
You see, the wipers are internally heated.
Yeah, but they overheat.
There's some microchips that don't...
I'm sorry.
I'll have this under control in just a minute.
Don't worry.
Don't panic.
I never got the bugs out of it.
Well what's that?
It's a washing machine for human beings.
It really conserves a lot of water.
- I could use one for my dog.
- Sure.
Listen, Roger, I hope it's not too painful for you but the reason I'm here is to talk to you about your cousin Harry.
- You heard what happened?
- Yeah, I'm with the police department.
Crime Lab.
And...
I don't know how to say this, but the morgue lost Harry's remains.
Lost them?
Yeah.
I was wondering if there was anything unusual in Harry's medical history.
Like narcolepsy or catalepsy.
You mean, where someone appears to be dead and then wakes up.
Right.
No.
Harry never had anything like that.
Why?
You think Harry's still alive?
I don't know.
It's weird, though.
Well, if you find out anything, call me at the station, all right?
Yeah, sure, I will.
And please let me know anything that you find out.
Yeah, I will.
- Nice to see you again.
- Yeah, you too.
Goodbye.
Harry.
- I almost died in that thing for real.
- He's with the police.
- Now the cops are on to us.
- Oh, bull.
Sure, they had to investigate, but they got nothing.
You worry too much.
Puffer-fish toxin can used to create so-called zombies a form of suspended animation.
I don't think there any drugs involved here, Tina.
He had this clipped behind his ear.
- It's warm.
- Yeah.
There's a very subtle vibration.
Not much to see, though.
A sealed transistorized piece.
It's humming.
It's quite nice.
- Are you all right?
- Yes, I'm fine.
What was that?
- This did it.
- It's not the object, it's the rhythm.
Well, I guess your inventor friend is really on to something.
Hey, what's that?
Don't be nervous.
It'll work like a dream.
Wait a minute We have an agreement.
No violence.
Then I won't have to use the gun, will I?
- So let's go, before we get made.
- All right.
Here.
These earplugs will filter out the signal.
Attention, all units in vicinity:
Central City Savings, 400 block North Chandler.
Silent alarm activated.
Possible robbery in progress.
Gentlemen.
You see, even he's not immune.
No!
- Are you crazy?
!
- No violence!
Now, that's the deal.
That's for us.
We gotta get out of here.
If you think I'm leaving empty-handed, you're out of your skull.
What are you doing?
Harry, come on.
Come on, please, Harry!
Harry, please.
Let's go.
We gotta get out of here now!
- Harry, please!
- All right, get the machine.
- Barry, what happened?
- Why, everybody passed out.
- Well, what was it, knockout gas?
- I don't know.
You were out too, Allen?
- Of course.
- It's funny finding you here, isn't it?
What were you doing in the bank?
I heard the call, I was in the vicinity, so I responded to see if I could help out.
- You got a problem with that?
- Just tell us again what happened.
- Here's the files.
- I looked in the window and I saw the two suspects.
I entered the bank to try to make an arrest and passed out cold.
These the guys you saw, was one of them Harry Milgrim?
- The last time I saw Harry, he was dead.
- Oh, yeah, but you knew he was still alive.
- What are you talking about?
- Isn't that Harry Milgrim?
- Yeah, that's Harry.
- And this is you, right?
These pictures were taken within a moment of each other.
What?
Harry must have been hiding.
Why would he hide?
You're plotting with him.
- You wanna make a formal accusation...
- Allen is in debt up to his ear.
That's a computer error!
Allen knows these guys.
He went to school with the cousin.
- He was in the loft with Milgrim.
- I didn't know Harry was in there.
Which leads me to believe Allen freed Milgrim and did the bank job with him, both times using the sleep gimmick.
But somehow Allen got left behind when the alarm suddenly went off.
Why don't you get some coffee, Farrow.
Now.
- He's out of his mind.
- Look, you take it easy, Allen.
Farrow finds a bad apple in our barrel and that makes his career.
Now, I want to believe you.
But is there anything at all you want to tell me?
I think it's fairly clear where I stand on this, lieutenant.
I am innocent!
All right.
- I want you to take couple days off.
- Lieutenant!
I want you out of harm's way.
We should've cleaned that bank out.
All we got was a taste.
It was just a random event.
The Flash can't be at every bank during every robbery.
I had my way, that's the last time he'd be anywhere.
I don't wanna talk about that.
Now, if we wanna expand, we gotta find some help.
Let's see if we can get a pro for our team.
Hey, Harry.
I heard you were dead.
Then you just saw a ghost.
- You understand me, Fosnight?
- Sure, Harry.
I'll send you a wreath.
Stan Morse.
- This is my cousin Roger.
- I got your message.
I ain't interested.
- Why not?
- Am I ever interested in your schemes?
Do yourself a favor, pal, stay away from the Loksh.
Well, it's your loss, Stan, you don't want in on it.
Plenty of other guys would be interested in working the sleep angle with us.
Smarter guys.
Come on, Roger.
Hey, wait a minute.
You did this?
- Guilty.
- You better be.
I swear, Harry.
None of your antics.
So you want in or not?
Step into my office.
There you are, miss.
Hey, hey, wait a minute.
What is that...?
Oh, this is great.
Look at this!
Roger, Roger.
Look.
Look!
We better get out.
- We gotta go now.
- Come on, Roger, live a little.
Look.
Harry, we got enough.
Come on.
- Harry!
- You know, he's right.
Your problem is, you never know when to get out.
Let's move it.
I might have to go through a departmental hearing.
I can't believe they're raking me over the coals.
- Barry, if you've done nothing wrong...
- Tina, technical innocence isn't enough.
When you're a cop, a shadow of doubt is too much.
The only way I'm gonna clear my name is by solving this case.
And it all hangs on this damn thing.
Anything new on it?
Yes.
I don't think the mechanism itself is very important.
But the sound has to correspond with a combination of brain waves that brings on a coma.
What I have to do is isolate that combination.
Well, it's just a sound.
You should be able to block it with earplugs, yes?
Not ordinary earplugs.
You could still feel it through bone conduction.
But there is a more dangerous problem.
If the brain function drops to this level for too long, then you'll die.
Well, those people in the bank were all right after they woke up.
They weren't unconscious long enough.
But if these thieves keep using this device, sooner or later, somebody is going to die.
McGee.
Yes.
Thank you.
I've asked to be kept informed if there's any more news.
There is.
Another slumber robbery shocked the city.
This time, thieves made up with loot to the tune of $ 20 million according to authorities.
In related news, we've received a report that Police Officer Barry Allen a forensic specialist, who was present during the robbery is being questioned in connection with it.
Authorities are calling this a bizarre incident...
Now Farrow is using the press to plead his case.
I've gotta put a stop to this.
- Where are you going?
- Visit an old classmate.
Now, that's my version of a sleeping machine.
Swede, round up the boys.
Hurry up.
Those won't be the only cops nosing around.
So, Stan, take a look.
This is where it all started.
Yeah.
With a big signal, we could take down a lot of things.
With a booster attachment, we could have as big a signal as we want.
Right, Roger?
Right.
It's in here.
Somewhere.
We can get into places we couldn't get into before.
- I mean, we could sack...
- The whole town.
You like it?
Good night, Central City.
- What an idea.
- We're only as big as we want to be in life.
So are we ready, Rog?
No.
No.
I'm sorry, but the game is over.
- Hey, what are you talking about?
- The mice.
The mice are dead.
So?
Now you can afford to buy new ones.
You don't understand.
I was testing the sleep amplifier on the mice and it killed them.
- So what?
So if it's left on long enough, it'll kill people.
Oh, yeah.
So, well, we'll just turn it off before anybody gets hurt.
No, no.
It's way too risky.
I won't be responsible for murder.
Look, don't we have enough?
All those diamonds.
- I knew it.
- Look, look.
Just give me one second.
- Give me that damn booster.
- No.
Harry, put that away.
I'm your family.
- Give me it!
- No.
You shot me.
I told you, Roger.
- Stay away!
- You're hurt.
Roger, what happened?
Are you all right?
- We've gotta get you some help.
- Barry, I thought I saw something else.
I must have been hallucinating.
They wanna do big things.
They wanna use my machine on the whole city.
Just hold on, Roger.
Roger.
He must have been waiting for us.
It's the only way he could've jumped us like that.
He's fast, all right.
Never even saw him.
Let's see.
"Barry Allen, 270 Edgemore Avenue."
Hey, wait a minute.
This is the cop they talked about on the news.
They think he's involved.
This is perfect.
Barry.
Barry.
- Barry!
- Lieutenant.
- Roger's been hurt.
- He's dead, Barry.
He was killed with this.
It was in your hand.
- What?
- What happened here?
It's obvious.
Allen knocked off Braintree to silence him.
You wanna read him his rights, or do I have to do it?
Barry, I just want you to know that all the guys are with you on this, okay?
A hundred percent.
There's no way we believe these bogus charges.
If you say you're innocent, that's good enough for us.
Thanks, Murph.
- You are innocent, right?
- Yes.
Okay, okay.
You have a visitor.
You can talk, but don't talk too long.
Otherwise I'm in big trouble.
Okay?
Ms. McGee.
- Barry, what are they doing to you?
- It's a frame, Tina.
The guys with the machine murdered the inventor and made it look like I did it.
- But how could anyone believe that?
I found a good lawyer, and he'll able to help you.
I can't worry with that right now.
First I have to find Harry Milgrim and his pals.
I've been working on the computer simulation.
No human could survive exposure to the sleep signal for more than two hours.
I've isolated the sound pattern and I'm working on the earplug filter, but I...
Lieutenant, listen to her.
Harry's machine is going to kill people all over town.
Are you sure you don't want to tell me something?
Yes.
I've told you everything.
- It's your share of the diamond-center job.
- What?
Found it in your bedroom closet.
- The blue one goes where?
- No, no.
The red one, the red one.
Yeah, I know it's the red one, but where does it go?
Oh, yeah, that's it.
- Is this thing gonna work?
- I'll stake my life on it.
You are.
We all are.
Hey, lighten up, Stan.
I wired it just like Roger's note said.
This will patch the sleep unit into all the old air-raid sirens throughout the city.
And we can control it by this from wherever we are.
I bet they haven't tested these sirens in over 20 years.
I checked the panel.
Those circuits are hot.
And those horns were built to last.
They'll be heard all over town.
When I hit this button, it's lights out.
Go ahead, lock her up, Swede.
- What's that?
- I had the Swede here set up a lock.
If a security patrol comes by, they won't have time to break in.
Good thinking, Stan.
Yeah, I thought so.
How many ways do you want me to say this?
They stole my keys when I was unconscious.
You'd do yourself good if you'd tell us where the next score is gonna be.
If I knew, I would tell you.
Roger said something about knocking out the whole city.
Oh, the whole city.
Putting a room full of people to sleep is one thing.
- But if you expect me to believe...
- Damn it.
Why take the risk?
Just let me out, and I'll help you find out what's going down.
It's a stupid bluff, Allen.
I'm not buying it.
Unbelievable!
- Is that the guy, the witch-finder general?
- Yeah, that's him.
Nobody I can talk to believes this jerk.
Look, we're all rooting for you, all right?
This is a nightmare.
I think I'm awake.
But a lot of people won't be shortly, and they could sleep forever.
You're not the only one worried.
They beefed up patrols.
Everybody's looking out for Harry and that other guy.
- Is there anything I can get you?
- How about a cake?
Put a file in it.
- Yeah.
Well, you hang in there, man.
- Yeah.
Where else?
Hey, Mingo.
Any chance at calling out for a pizza?
Oh, bless you, sir.
Thank you.
When did you discover you had a vocation, Fosnight?
- Stop persecuting me.
- I will as soon as you give me answers.
So, what's the problem, Allen?
You're afraid of the cops?
I don't get it.
Has the world gone crazy?
How about Harry Milgrim coming back from the dead?
That's crazy.
He's crazy.
He's doing a job with a real hard case, Stan Morse who used to not even talk to Harry.
- I want to find them both.
You want me to rat out Stan Morse, huh?
Who's gonna pay for my funeral, the police benevolent fund?
If you don't help me, there's gonna be a lot of funerals.
Heavy death toll.
This is weird.
I feel like I'm in Dr. Strangelove.
First they talk about civil defense, and now you talk about death tolls.
Civil defense?
That might just make sense.
Thanks.
Oh, and drop the habit, all right?
You're not the religious type.
Oh, Barry, I finished the earplug that should filter the signal.
Where are you?
The corner of Waterman and Fourth.
I think the sleep signal is gonna come over the civil-defense sirens but I don't know where the control station is.
Can you punch the map up?
I could try.
Allen.
Hey, Allen, wake up.
I wanna talk to you.
I'll take a plain one.
Yeah, give me a couple too.
Maybe the nitrates will knock me out.
So I've been going to this doctor.
He specializes in insomnia and winter depression.
Says I gotta just change the hour I go to bed.
Move it up an hour every night.
That might work.
- Yeah, but it takes a month, you know?
- Thanks.
By that time, I'll be having dinner at breakfast and the late show will be the kids' cartoons.
Thanks, Murph.
I paid last time, you know that?
What's this?
Little late for a delivery, isn't it?
I don't like the looks of this truck.
How about you?
This is Officer Bellows.
We got a strange one on Fifth and Western.
Checking it out.
Is this beautiful, or what?
Hey, we better get ready.
We want to get in before the stores close.
- Yeah, we got a couple cops coming.
- Well, let's go say hello.
Hey, guys.
- What's going on, huh?
- Good evening, officers.
Good evening.
- Haven't I seen you somewhere before?
- Oh, I can't imagine where.
Well, how about a mug shot?
Come on, you got any ID?
Harry?
You must be dreaming.
I don't believe it.
I want the report on my desk by tomorrow morning at 9:00.
Hey, Allen got out of the lockup!
- please report to the corner of Fifth and Main.
Robbery in progress.
The suspect is requesting to see you...
Tina.
Tina.
No!
Barry, I've got it.
Barry, are you there?
My regards to the sandman!
All right, boys, let's fill our pockets!
Barry?
Hey, hey.
We'll do that later.
Just roll this thing out of the truck.
Let's go.
Why wait?
We got all the time in the world.
Blow the damn thing open now.
There's somebody walking around out there.
That's impossible.
One for each time zone.
"Looters on Western Avenue.
Only 10 minutes before sleepers start dying.
See map.
Sirens controlled from location circled.
Good luck."
Come on.
Come on.
We don't got all night.
There's no more room in the truck?
- Help me get some of that crap out.
- Hey.
- Or maybe we should steal...
- Harry, Harry.
We're coming to the end of the festivities.
I want to be gone when they wake up.
The night is young.
These people aren't going anyplace.
Hey, Harry!
Did you hear what your cousin said about his mice?
Who cares about his mice?
Mice don't live long anyway.
- What, you gonna kill all these people?
- You're breaking my heart.
Listen to me, Central City has a mint.
Harry, we'll take our act on the road.
We'll do them all.
It has a gold reserve.
It has a financial district stuffed with negotiable securities.
This is why I never wanted do jobs with you.
Because you're a wacko!
You know what I mean?
You're a flake.
Oh, you think so, huh?
All right.
Anybody else wanna give me an argument?
Hey.
Wait a minute.
It's not working.
Go to sleep!
Wait!
No!
Not my face!
What the hell is going on?
!
I'm running late, Harry.
Why don't you ride with me.
Murphy!
Come on, Mom, five more minutes.
What the hell?
What happened?
That sleep machine came on and knocked us out with all these other people.
Why...?
I haven't slept for three days.
Why didn't you let me sleep?
What the hell was that?
What...?
Look, I'm telling you, Allen is not in the cell.
All right.
All right.
Let's have a look.
Mingo, Schultz, come on.
What?
Harry Milgrim.
I did it.
Me.
Harry Milgrim.
TKO of an entire city.
Who can say they did that?
Nobody can take that away from me.
They'll be telling my story for years.
Barry Allen has taken a powder.
All right, come on, let's go.
You see, it's open.
Lieutenant, what's all the noise about?
Mingo, get this thing open.
Milgrim.
Milgrim, you tell them how Allen was in this from the beginning and how he killed your cousin.
- What, this bozo?
He didn't do a damn thing.
It was me.
I did it all.
A cop on my trail.
So, what do I do?
I frame him.
A criminal mastermind.
That's what I am.
Allen, what are you doing in Harry's cell?
- Get out of there!
- Yes, sir.
Harry, we reserved your room for you, pal.
Oh, thank you.
You're welcome.
All right, Allen, get back to work.
Say, Farrow, do I still get my last meal?

Let me in!
You have to let me in.
I have evidence for the defense!
This city's gone absolutely nuts.
I tried flowers.
Maybe I should get something else.
Everywhere you go, you hear about the Trickster.
Sabrina bitches how I work all the time.
So we go out, right?
Bump into an ex-girlfriend, now she thinks I'm cheating.
Today begins the trial of James Montgomery Jessie.
A multiple personality wanted for murder Jessie adopted the persona of the costumed psychopath known as the Trickster.
His days of violent mayhem in Central City were ended by fem private eye Megan Lockhart.
Accept no substitutes, ladies and gentlemen.
I am the genuine article.
I'm gonna make this city very sorry it ever crossed me.
Well, Barry Allen.
I'm gonna make you pay too, Allen.
You and your little cupcake girlfriend, Megan Lockhart.
And the Flash, the big red freak he'll pay the going rate 1 0 times over because nobody tricks the Trickster.
Nobody!
The last time we pulled this kind of duty was at that concert at Crystal Beach.
No kidding. I hear they're scalping tickets for seats outside.
They're welcome to mine.
There's lots of places I'd rather be.
Don't worry, there's no way the Trickster's gonna walk.
I'm not so sure.
He's got this hotshot lawyer defending him, Denise Cowan.
Cowan?
Didn't she get that Wall Street guy acquitted of murder?
-And they had videotapes of him doing it.
-Well, I'm glad I got front-row seats.
Well, at least Megan will be back in town.
I just want to testify and get out of here.
-l don't think it's gonna be that easy, man.
-Barry Allen.
You were nearly drowned by the Trickster because of your involvement with private eye Megan Lockhart.
Any comment?
-No.
-Are you gonna stand in the way of journalist inquiry, of the people's right to know?
-lt's un-American.
-Kline, you're making me nauseous.
Hey, Bar, if you don't tell your side of things Kline will put words in your mouth.
It's self-defense.
Come on, Bar.
Well, it all came to a head in the prop warehouse.
-Where Jessie knocked me out--
-Forget about him.
There she is!
Megan Lockhart.
The detective responsible for bringing the Trickster to justice.
She was kidnapped and forced to wear the costume of the Trickster's fantasy sidekick, Prank.
How does it feel to be the woman who stole the Trickster's heart?
I didn't steal anything.
It just kept coming gift-wrapped COD.
And I had help taking Jessie down--
There must have been something to make the Trickster so hot to trot.
-How far did you go to get your man?
-You have got to be kidding me.
I never kid, babe.
Look, I'll try to squeeze you all in, okay?
-Think you can squeeze me in?
-Get in line, fella.
Megan.
Barry.
Hi!
-You look great. I've never seen you--
-Oh, my secretary again.
-You have a secretary now?
-lt has been insane since we brought the Trickster in.
I have been turning down clients.
Which is why I haven't written lately, and I'm really sorry.
Can this reunion take five, because we have a deadline.
-Thank you.
-Later, boys.
We'll have time for pictures and statements after the hearing.
-Look, just get-
- Megan-- -l'll see you inside.
--on how this case is going to shape up?
Not quite the reunion I'd imagined.
You have to-- You have to let me in.
You just have to.
I'm carrying the Trickster's child.
You're just gonna have to carry him right back where you came from, lady.
You call this a trial?
This is nothing more than a kangaroo court without the hoppy, furry guy.
-Order, order!
-lf l were behind the bench, maybe--
Jessie, please!
Ms. Cowan, if you cannot control your client...
-...
I'm gonna have him restrained.
-Restrained?
What do you call these, costume jewelry?
Jessie, shut up!
It's bad enough you insist on wearing this ridiculous outfit in court.
Don't blow this for both of us.
What, and disappoint my loyal fans?
You don't have loyal fans.
The only person on your side is me!
And that's starting to look like a real bad career mood.
Your Honor, defense requests a change of venue.
-Are you nuts?
-l see no way that my client...
-...can get a fair trial in Central City.
-Leave Central City?
You are crazy. I love this town.
-And it loves me.
Look what I've done for it.
-Your Honor.
That is it.
You are in contempt of this court.
No!
I'll tell you who's in contempt.
This courtroom is in contempt.
The entire judicial system is in contempt.
North America, the land mass, is in contempt.
Jessie, get a grip!
You're losing it!
I'm perfectly sane.
I am the Trickster.
And you!
Pretending to be Prank when you were never my loyal sidekick.
Bailiff!
This is all your fault!
You're getting to be a drag, Jessie.
And I am bored stiff.
Megan attacked The Trickster.
He's down.
If I don't get complete silence, I'm going to empty this courtroom.
I'm gonna wave bail pending psychiatric evaluation.
This court is recessed until 9 a.m. Monday morning.
-Get him out of here!
-A few questions for the people out there- l'm sorry, not now. I'm sorry.
-He's too good for you, tramp!
-No, not now, really.
-Megan!
With Jessie in custody and Megan in town, no one's talking about the Flash anymore.
I'm not sure I like that.
-Joe Kline would kill for an interview.
-l don't want attention that much.
-Would you like another?
-No.
Thanks.
-lt's funny, don't you think?
-What?
A year ago, you came to me wanting to get rid of these powers.
Who'd have thought we'd be sitting here now, talking about the Flash's publicity?
Well, one thing hasn't changed.
I'm still a bottomless pit.
In the last year, I've gone near bust on food alone.
Thanks. I'm lying to everyone I know about my nights.
But, Barry, look at the good you've done.
You stopped the Trickster's rampage.
Well, I think I'm a little fed up with my own multiple personality.
Maybe I'll go public.
Make us both famous.
I and my faithful and beautiful companion Christina McGee, am in reality-- Megan.
Barry, Tina.
Small town, huh?
I saw you on the news.
I wish I had my autograph book on me.
-You really charmed the press.
-l'm sorry about that, Barry.
-But they just won't leave me alone.
-Well, when are we getting together?
You know, I really wish I could say, but I am buried.
l-- l'm meeting my agent for a drink.
Your agent?
This is a new you.
I'm getting book and movie offers out of nowhere.
As soon as things lighten up, I promise we'll get together.
-Yeah. I'll check my schedule.
-Great.
I've gotta go. I'm busy too, you know.
What's that about, McGee?
Megan, for a detective, sometimes you miss some pretty big clues.
I've already told you, counselor.
No.
No.
No!
Damn it, Jessie.
You are going to have to listen to me and follow my lead, or you can kiss any hope of acquittal goodbye.
So who the hell needs you anyway?
I've got law degrees too, you know.
-A whole trunk full of them.
-Mail call.
You're some lucky guy, Tricksy.
You've got a secret admirer.
Yep.
And one who's dead set on using up all the cheap perfume in town.
is this the police department's idea of a joke?
No.
These were delivered by a bona fide representative of the U.S. Post Office.
Oh, boy.
This is disgusting.
-She's crazy about me.
-Yeah, well, you're half right anyway.
Counselor, visiting hours are over.
-Jessie, remember what I said.
-Yeah, yeah.
Maybe I should be defending myself.
Don't be a fool.
I can't help it.
"l'll get you out.
Prank."
Prank?
-You brought Sabrina here on a date?
-Well, at least I'll be seen with her.
Maybe we'll run into one of his other old flames.
Look, I keep telling you, Sabrina.
Baby, Jinx and I are old news.
-Jinx?
-When I walked into that club...
-...she was all over him like a cheap suit.
-You had a girlfriend named Jinx?
Oh, what's in a name?
Mr. Jessie.
You understand that another outburst like Friday's will not be tolerated.
Your Honor, before we begin, my client would like to address the court.
-lf the people have no objection.
-The people have no objection.
Your Honor you can't imagine how sorry I am for what I've done.
But I am under the influence of demons inside me battling for my very soul.
I swear to you, if I could have stopped the killing, I would have.
But I'm so weak.
The others inside me are so strong.
This is a load of--
But I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry.
Your Honor, my client can't....
What the hell is that?
I will not have my courtroom turned into a circus.
Bailiff, get rid of that teddy bear!
Laughing gas.
You can't go.
-You're gonna blow this case.
-Whose side are you on anyway?
Sacrificing yourself for a lawyer?
-Time to rethink your priorities, bub.
-No time.
Let's go.
-He's gone.
-No, not again.
What happened in there?
I'm sorry.
Please, just try the pound.
I'm sure they'll be able to find--
-Mendez!
-Yes, lieutenant.
I want everything on Jessie's love letters from his secret admirer.
-Chemical analysis, the works.
-l'm on the way.
You. I want you to get ahold of your girlfriend.
This time, she gets police protection.
Well, Jessie's got a better shot at getting to Megan these days than I do.
-Here we are.
Home sweet home.
-Home?
After Daddy died, I moved out of the estate and into the apartments here on the top floor.
Zoey Clark.
Clarx Toys' Clark. I love your stuff!
Gl Johnny, OMA.
-One Man Army
-One Man Army
When I saw you on TV, I knew I had found a kindred spirit.
No one gets you but me.
I've spent my entire life looking for bigger and bigger kicks.
Weeklong parties joy riding shoplifting burglary, arson grand theft.
An impressive resume.
And you are the ultimate thrill.
There's no denying that.
I can't believe I finally got the Trickster.
Forget the Trickster.
He's old news.
Perhaps next time I'll become Vladimir Jessinsky, concert pianist, da?
Forget Vladimir!
I want the Trickster.
That tramp Megan Lockhart never deserved to wear this.
But I do.
Aren't you glad to see your little sidekick, Prank?
Prank.
Prank!
Prank?
Yeah, baby, it's Prank.
And you're the Trickster.
Trickster.
Prank.
Thank heaven you got here in time.
Oh, Trickster, you're the best.
Forget the mushy stuff.
There is so much I have to do.
And I won't make the same mistakes twice.
Whatever you need, I can get for you.
-Anything?
-Anything.
I have always wanted one of these.
Perfect!
The gall of this third-rate metropolis, putting me on trial.
I'd do anything for you, Trickster.
Anything.
It's time we made that red-suited goon pay.
And Megan too.
This time I take no prisoners and post no bills.
Guess what, Central City, the Trickster's back.
And I've got him.
Don, can this not wait till I get back?
Wait.
Just hold on one second.
Hello?
Danny, I told you, quit bugging me.
Hello?
Yeah, Paul, I need to speak with you.
Hold on.
Hello?
Don, I'll get back to you.
Okay.
Melanie, where is that package I asked you for?
-This must have cost a bundle.
-Comped by the hotel.
Yeah, Paul. I got that fax you sent me, and the terms are totally unacceptable.
Hold all of Ms. Lockhart's calls, please.
Thank you.
-Hey, what's the big idea?
-All I've gotten from you is a busy signal.
I am trying to handle the agency in San Francisco...
-...and juggle the media at the same time.
-l'm delighted.
You've got a bigger problem than your career.
The Trickster?
Don't I know it.
This came for me special delivery this afternoon.
And you opened it without calling the bomb squad or me?
Relax, Barry, I'm a pro. I made sure it wasn't a bomb.
Check it out.
Dead rat?
"Some discoloration may occur after dying.
Love, the Trickster.
P.S., give my best to the Flash."
-Cute, huh?
-We'll get you round-the-clock protection.
I have all the protection I need, thank you.
Megan, save the Sam Spade crap for the press, all right?
-Jessie almost killed both of us.
-Barry, I can handle this.
Oh, so you don't want me around.
Actually, I've given it a lot of thought.
How would you like to move to San Francisco?
-What?
-l mean, go into partnership with me in the agency.
-The agency?
-Well, think about it, Barry.
No more being stuck behind test tubes in the lab.
All the hyperspeed street work you want.
-Plus you get paid really well for it.
-l like those test tubes.
Okay.
Well, think about it.
Let me know.
So now on to Jessie.
Look, no offense, but the cops don't seem to be getting results.
Here's a list of possible hideouts.
Warehouses, theaters, amusement parks.
You do the legwork, and I'll track the phony stenographer.
If I need to reach you, I'll call you.
And I need a national check on all female mental patient escapees.
-You have better access at the station.
-l'm working for you?
I figured if we're tracking the Trickster, I should coordinate.
You assume a lot.
This has to do with the fact that I left town, doesn't it?
Look, Barry, I know we have a lot to talk about.
I'll find him myself.
You did it again, Megan.
Okay, ready in the booth.
Ready on cameras.
Four, three, two....
-You're on the air.
-And we are back.
So, what you're saying, babe is since your partner died, things have just not been the same.
Let's face it, babe, this dog pile of a city refuses to recognize genius.
Now let's cut to the chase and get down to the heart of the matter.
Come on, speed-o, let's forget about the little Lockhart twist.
We both know I'm gonna kill her sooner or later.
Unless I decide....
Jessie, you are unbelievable.
So I'm calling you out, babe.
Just you and me.
The final showdown.
The Thriller in Manila.
-She said what to you tonight?
-That woman aggravates me.
-l don't work for her.
-At least she's mistreating you.
Sabrina won't even talk to me.
The Flash versus the Trickster in a final ground-pounding asphalt-churning, nitro-burning duel of the titans.
You know where, babe.
It's time Central City started recognizing its real heroes.
You know what I mean?
Good.
Now get out of here.
I love you.
You're beautiful.
Man, does Kline need a new makeup man, or what?
Not now, babe.
How reality stinks.
That's why I try and improve on it whenever I can.
Well, what do you think?
Not too subdued?
Cheap harlot!
Hey!
Get them off me!
Get them off me!
-Who wants gum?
-l do. I do.
-Are you okay?
-No.
But go get them.
You see, it's that little touch of epoxy in the gum that does the trick.
Shoes.
Mallet.
Are we gonna kill him?
No.
I have a much more interesting idea.
Right, old buddy?
Right.
Good morning, sunshine!
It's a beautiful day in my neighborhood.
Won't you be my neighbor?
-Stop it, Jessie.
-The Trickster to you.
And I'm Prank.
-l thought Megan was Prank.
-l'm Prank!
Me!
And don't you forget it.
-But don't you wanna see who--?
-He is the mask.
Without the mask, he's nothing.
Bupkes, nada, zip.
Just some boring, average, insignificant jerk nobody cares about who'll die alone and forgotten watching game shows in an empty apartment with cats.
So you touch that mask again, I'll murder you!
Okay?
Women.
So, what are you gonna do, kill me?
The last thing I want is you dead.
With a little help, you'll come around to my way of thinking.
We're gonna have so much fun together once I reprogram your brain.
Come to me.
Mine.
Yes, you are.
Come, Flash.
Oh, Flashie-poo.
Oh, stop it, stop it, stop it!
He is such a baby.
-What are we gonna do now, Trickster?
-We?
As in, you and me?
Hey, reality check, sweetie pie.
You can't begin to understand the depth and genius of my plans.
Besides, it's guy stuff.
I will make this bug house of a city pay for the indignity it's laid at my feet with the help of you my pal the Flash.
I blame myself, Tina.
I blew it.
I was so caught up in paperwork and promotions, I lost my edge.
Don't be silly.
We're dealing with a dangerous lunatic here who seems to be getting help from this Prank.
I'm so stupid. I mean, I care about Barry.
And somehow we never even got a chance to talk.
And now Jessie's got him.
He's got radios in those wings of his, doesn't he?
The transceivers proved too sensitive for hyperspeed.
-And Barry hated them anyway.
-Hated being on a leash, I bet.
I could track his heat patterns.
I'd have to tap into the satellite system.
It would take time, and it's not legal either.
Maybe I should have offered you the partnership.
-Partnership?
-Tina, Barry is bigger than forensics.
And I could really use his help in San Francisco.
-He's considering the offer?
-Besides you, what's keeping him here?
Barry does not stay in Central City on my account.
We are just good friends.
It's not like that.
Face it, McGee, you two are a team, romantic or otherwise.
Hey, dude, your hand is, like, smoking.
Thanks, partner.
That's enough.
You're under arrest.
You too, Flash.
Don't move, or I'll shoot!
What are you wearing?
-Put it down.
-Come on.
Come on.
It's not guns that kill people, it's these little hard things.
Hey, partner, got a match?
-Left them in my other suit.
-No problemo.
Yes!
Yes!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Too safe and too sane.
Wrong one.
Murph, come on.
Come on, Murph!
Murph!
Beautiful.
Wait till you see what else I got lined up.
I love that guy.
I can't believe it, Murph.
The Flash has gone bad.
I thought you guys were gonna wait for me.
-We were having way too much fun.
-You got that right, partner.
You said I could fire the candle.
Whine, whine, whine.
You're getting to be a real drag.
I've had enough of your mewling and puking.
Hey, forget about the ball and chain.
What next?
Well, I figure we drop the little woman off at home, then it's boys' night out.
Yes, Madam Mayor, I know he's fast.
I don't know how.
I promise you, I am doing everything I can.
Everything!
Okay, the Flash and the Trickster have defaced a children's mural at the Civic they let out the poisonous snakes and dynamited the River Street Bridge.
Traffic's backed up to the state line, sir.
I have had better weeks.
Roberts, I want an APB on the Flash out on the wire now.
You notify the SWAT team we need heavy firepower.
Come on, Murph.
What?
We dig a trench, we put tar paper over it.
The Flash hits that, boom, we got him.
Murphy, Bellows, how about earning your pay and hitting the streets!
-Yes, sir. I'm driving.
-Yes, sir!
Hey, has anybody seen Barry?
You and me, pal.
We'll make this city pay.
They called us crazy, drove us out on the streets....
-Hey, this is great!
-They put us on trial.
-Now we'll make them think twice.
-Hey I could vibrate my fingers through somebody's brain.
Gross.
Well, maybe later.
But seriously, we are gonna put Central City on trial.
I'm ready to paint this town red.
Paint the town red!
Believe it or not, the Flash has joined the Trickster spreading violence and vandalism through the city.
Citizens have been asked to stay off the street.
The mayor is said to be requesting the National Guard to quell this crime wave.
Sorry, Al.
The MAC 1 1 s, did you trace them?
Bought by DLC Corporation.
A subsidiary of Clarx Toys.
Thanks, Al.
Everything the Trickster and this Prank nut have used comes from Clarx Toys.
How's your search going?
Getting into the tracking system is more difficult than I thought.
But there's a bigger problem.
He's done something to Barry's mind.
Maybe brainwashed him.
When we do find him, he won't be happy to see us.
Oh, great.
Not only are we up against the Trickster, but the Flash too.
If we're lucky, the Trickster's programming won't be anything but superficial.
I think I can override it with an Army technique:
A shot of adrenaline to countermand the programming.
Good Lord, is there anything you don't know?
I wish I knew more.
Because if this doesn't work, Barry could die.
I think we should visit our local Clarx toy store.
Well, if it isn't the girl from court.
I'm not laughing now, babe.
-Who are you?
-Prank.
Your real name.
-Zoey.
-Zoey what?
-Clark!
-Where's the Trickster?
-l hope he's all right.
-After what he's done to you?
Oh, brother.
Let me clue you in, honey.
I am way more unstable than you so you better tell me where he is right now.
Don't tell him I told you.
-He's putting the city on trial.
-Let's go, McGee.
Forget about her.
We gotta get to the courthouse.
The court of no recourse is now in session.
Could we have the theme, please?
Will the accused come on down?
All right, kill the music.
What is the meaning of this outrage?
Jessie.
James, as your counsel, I strongly advise you against taking this action.
You're just like all the rest:
Manipulative, faithless, self-serving.
No use to me at all.
You're fired!
Bailiff, read the charges.
"Central City and you, its representatives, are on trial for crimes against good taste."
And me.
-This is absurd!
-l'm sure I can get a continuance on this.
Was I talking to you?
Has the jury reached a verdict?
We have, Your Honor.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
They're guilty!
Guilty.
Guilty.
Any last words before I pronounce sentence?
And especially you!
Speechless with contrition, eh?
I find every last one of you guilty as sin and sentence you to death.
Are you prepared to carry out sentence, Mr. Executioner?
No.
I can't decide which to use.
Well, that's why they call me the hanging judge.
Well, what's stopping you, palomino?
I can't move.
An attack of conscience, eh?
This had to be sooner or later.
I'm taking you in for good this time, Jessie.
You never let us have any fun.
You know who I am, and I know you're not a killer.
Of course you're a killer.
You're a freak of nature.
You can do whatever you want because you can get away with it!
Don't do it, red.
You're better than that.
You ruined everything!
Kill her!
Kill her already!
-You shot my partner!
-Barry, listen to me.
The Trickster tried to kill you and Megan.
He is not your partner, I am.
You know that!
We've been through hell together.
And I've always stood by you.
And I always will.
For as long as you want me to.
-Tina?
-Yeah.
Tina.
-Help!
-Jessie.
Body armor.
I'm not crazy, you know.
I've got a bomb and I will use it.
Let her go!
Megan, go after Jessie.
The Flash needs a few seconds to recover.
-Like hell I do.
-Relax.
Tina rewired that scooter of his.
Get in!
I like it.
-What is this?
-l had it made for you.
It's the great Trickster escape mobile.
For me?
Gee, after I treated you like dirt.
Hung you out to dry.
I love you madly.
That's why I had it equipped with all the options.
Oh, darling, it won't work.
I'm no good for you.
Besides, how can I miss you when you won't go away?
Good evening, my dear.
I'm Officer Murphy, and you are under arrest.
Damn!
Give it up, Jessie!
Join me in hell.
Where's the Flash when you really need him?
Might break me out of here.
They think a padded cell can stop me.
How wrong they are.
This will be my polyfoam fortress.
They're in for such a big surprise.
Because nobody tricks the Trickster.
Nobody!
Thanks, Tina.
If you hadn't shown up, I'd still be running around in those crazy boots.
What would I do without you?
Oh, I don't know.
Supermarket openings maybe.
Never.
Wow, I wish I'd have been in court.
No, you wanna stay far away from guys like Jessie.
-Hey, guys.
-Hi.
-Caught them out in the hallway.
-Julio left the concert tickets here.
Tickets?
I thought you were breaking up.
Well, we had a mature discussion about the direction of our relationship.
Yeah, he came back groveling on his hands and knees.
-Well, we'd love to stay, but we got a date.
-Bye.
Bet those two don't make it out to the parking lot.
-So you're off to San Francisco.
-Yeah.
We have way too many goodbyes.
I left something burning at the lab.
I'll see you later.
We make a great team, Lockhart.
See you around.
Yeah, you too, McGee.
She's great. I mean, not your average science type.
Tina's the best.
Look, before I put my foot in my mouth I think I owe you an apology.
I've been a little preoccupied lately.
-This I noticed.
-l'm really sorry, Barry.
I've just been trying to keep my head above water.
So have you thought about my offer?
Megan, I would love to come to San Francisco with you.
-God, that's terrific!
Great, Barry.
-But-- But I can't.
You can't?
No.
Central City's my home, you know?
My family is here.
My friends are here.
I'm just not ready to say goodbye.
My loss.
Well, I still have a few days before I have to head back.
Some of those long goodbyes.
More goodbyes?
Hey, Allen.
We got work to do.
Increased intellectual activity.
Stress level's rising.
- What's the problem?
- I can't be certain yet.
Give me audio contact.
Pull the trigger, Alpha.
Pull the trigger now.
That's a direct order.
I-
Damn it.
All right, close it down.
This is Dr. Rossick.
The training exercise is now terminated.
Will that be all, Dr. Rossick?
Yeah, Frank.
Thanks a lot.
What happened?
I think she was confused by the moral decision she was forced to make.
"Moral decision"?
What the hell are you talking about?
Alpha can make choices.
Sometimes they bewilder her.
I don't want her to make choices.
I want her to take orders and kill who I tell her to kill.
You see, that's just the point.
You asked her to commit murder.
Rossick, she is supposed to be the ultimate covert assassin.
This project cost $30 million, and you're telling me it doesn't work.
Calm down, Powers.
She'll just take a little fine-tuning.
We'll be operational by the end of the week.
You had better be.
All right, everybody, just leave her in the lab and you can go.
We'll start over in the morning.
- Good night, doctor.
- Good night.
Ernest, I've forgotten my briefcase.
I'll be right back.
Alpha?
What are you doing out here?
This is Dr. Rossick.
We've got a level-four emergency.
Alpha One has just escaped.
She may be armed.
And she is definitely dangerous.
FLASH 1x21 "ALPHA" Subtitles subXpacio and TusSeries
- Apocalypse Wow?
- It's a new club that just opened up.
Sabrina's throwing a charity bash there.
It's gonna be wild.
- You gotta come.
- I don't know.
It doesn't sound like my kind of place, you know?
- Can't I just make a donation?
- No.
- I haven't even got a date.
- It's no problem.
I called up Tina.
You're supposed to pick her up at Star Labs at 8.
- What, are you my social director now?
- Hey, somebody's gotta do it.
- Well, we can stop by for a few minutes.
- Great.
Do me a favor, though.
Try and dress a little hip, all right?
It's party time.
Barry, you look like an undertaker.
Thank you.
Listen, Tina, I'm sure you're just as excited about this evening as I am so we'll just stay long enough to make Julio and Sabrina happy...
- ... then sneak out the back, all right?
- You're gonna hate me...
- ...but I can't come.
- What?
I'm sorry, but my experiment's gone wrong.
- So you'll do it again tomorrow.
- No, Barry, I can't.
No, I am not gonna leap into disco inferno alone.
Barry, I can't.
I have to do the experiment tonight, finish the report and have it on the review committee's desk by 9 a. m. in the morning.
Believe me, I'd rather come out with you than work all night.
Yeah, right.
What are all these old research papers doing out?
I'm leaving now.
Is there anything else you need?
Oh, no, thank you.
Oh, Alpha, this is Barry Allen, a friend of mine.
Barry, this is Alpha Webster.
She just started as our new lab assistant.
Alpha, that's an unusual name.
They call me Alpha because I was the first.
- The first child in your family.
- In a way.
Do you know what these are doing out?
I'm sorry, I was trying to organize your files.
That's okay, I have my own filing system, thank you.
I'll see you tomorrow, then.
- Good night.
- Bye.
Don't you think you should be going?
It's nearly 8:00.
Wait.
Hey, what about Alpha?
- Do you think she's free tonight?
- That is not a good idea.
- Why not?
- She's very bright but a bit damp in the personality department.
All business.
I know you're gonna meet a lot of beautiful young women there.
No one with less than 12 earrings or more than a monosyllable.
Well, here's mine for the evening:
- Out!
- All right.
Really, it's greatly appreciated.
We won't forget it.
Thank you.
Sorry.
Come on, man.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Barry!
Hey, don't you know that black is out as a fashion statement?
Haven't you heard?
It's back in, man.
Yeah, very, very in.
- Where's Tina?
- She couldn't make it.
Introduce yourself to the bartender.
Tell him you're a friend of mine.
He'll point out all the available chicks.
- Money for the homeless.
- Is that good or bad?
Come on!
There she is.
There's too many people on this street.
We'll let her get around the corner before closing in.
We don't wanna cause a scene.
Where'd she go?
She go inside?
- Sorry.
- Hey.
Alpha, right?
- And you're Barry Allen.
- You have a good memory.
Listen, why don't we go try to grab a seat, huh?
- All right.
- All right.
Excuse me.
What do you think the odds are of us running into each other tonight?
Two million seven hundred and eighteen thousand four hundred and fifty to one based on the most recent population of Central City.
Wow, you really do have a memory.
I've memorized the Encyclopaedia Britannica, Webster's Dictionary the complete works of William Shakespeare and 613 other books.
- You're not serious.
- Yes.
Where I used to live, after everyone left, I'd stay up all night and read books.
- Trouble sleeping, huh?
- No.
I don't need to.
- At all?
- No.
It's such a waste of time.
Oh, here.
Quick, grab these.
There we go.
One night I read a book about the Civil War.
Did you know that Abraham Lincoln freed all the slaves?
- Well, I heard a rumor.
- That's when I realized I didn't want anyone telling me what to do or locking me up.
I wanted to make my own choices.
I mean, if people can be free, why can't I?
- Right.
- It's all for a good cause, folks.
So dig deep.
Remember, the more it hurts, the more it helps.
Thank you, sir.
Very kind.
Oh, very generous of you.
Thank you.
Help the homeless.
Thank you, sir.
Oh, thank you, sir.
- Thank you, sir.
- Would you excuse me?
- I see an old friend.
- Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Something for the homeless?
- That's the best you can do?
- Hello, Fosnight.
Hey, Allen.
Sharp threads.
Didn't anybody tell you that black is out?
- You care to make a little donation?
- To whom?
The old hustlers' home?
Excuse me, miss.
Would you make sure the committee chairman gets this?
Thank you.
Give me one good reason why I shouldn't run you in.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Look, Barry, you let me go, and I'll owe you one.
A big one.
You know my marker's as good as gold.
All right, but this is the last time, okay?
- Next time I have to book you.
- You won't regret it.
Anytime you need anything, give me a call.
The same thing goes for you, honey.
Any friend of Barry's is a friend of mine.
Ciao.
What are they doing?
I have no idea.
- I can't keep up with all the new dances.
- Looks like fun.
Come on.
Well, actually I'm no good at-
- I like this.
- Where did you learn to do that?
- Are you a professional dancer?
- I've never danced before.
What?
Help for the homeless?
What, are you kidding?
Come on.
There she is.
Let's go.
Move!
Go!
Move!
Out of the way.
Alpha!
- Are you in trouble?
- It's just that-
- All right.
Time to come home.
- What's going on here?
Stay out of this.
It's none of your business.
- Hey, buddy.
I happen to be a cop.
- You want to stay healthy?
Back off.
- Don't make this difficult.
- I don't want to go.
It's not up to you.
Come on!
Hey!
Don't shoot!
- Who are you?
- I'm not telling you squat.
"National Scientific Intelligence Agency."
I've never heard of you.
What's going on here?
This is government business, pal.
You better cut me loose right now.
I don't think so.
We can get her address from her application but if the NSIA's involved, she's in serious trouble.
- Who are they?
- They're a top-secret government-
Somebody's jimmied the security system.
Barry, what is that?
Come out, Alpha.
- You've been shot.
- I'm all right.
What are you?
This is incredible.
A synthetic humanoid with artificial intelligence.
Who created you?
I was built as part of a secret project by the NSIA.
My name isn't Alpha Webster.
It's Alpha One:
Artificial Lifelike Prototype Humanoid Android One.
I got the name Webster from the dictionary.
What are you doing here?
I ran away.
The purpose of the project was to create robot intelligence agents.
Androids that could be programmed to kill particular targets.
The theory was that droids are stronger and smarter than humans and virtually unstoppable.
Only, I was created with the ability to make decisions and I decided I didn't want to kill.
I wanted to be free.
So those people who are after you-
Want to take me back and reprogram me.
Why did you come to Star Labs?
Why apply for a job here?
Part of me was designed by you, Dr. McGee.
- That's impossible.
- Three years ago, you worked with Dr. Jason Rossick on a robotics project for the government.
That's right.
The idea was to build robotic limbs for handicapped people.
There were problems, and I left the project.
Last year, Dr. Rossick went to work for the NSIA.
He's the one that designed and built me.
- Alpha, may I take an x-ray of you?
- Of course.
I'd like to see what they've done to my work.
Okay, just lie on the scanning table so I can record your image.
You still haven't told us why you're here.
Because there are certain circuits inside me that I want to alter and I need to access Dr. McGee's research.
What circuits?
Someone's at the main entrance.
- Yes?
- Dr. McGee.
Colonel Powers, NSIA.
I have a federal warrant to search the premises.
- Powers?
What do you want?
- This is a matter of national security.
Either you open this door, or we break it down.
Wait a minute.
I'm working on an experiment with toxic chemicals.
I have to make sure the lab's not contaminated.
You've got 10 seconds.
What has Christine Powers got to do with this?
She's in charge of the project that developed me.
- Do you know her?
- Unfortunately.
She was the NSIA coordinator on a project I worked on with Jason Rossick.
She's ruthless, cold and dangerous.
She's the reason I left the robotics project.
She wants to take me back and erase my memory circuits.
It'll be as if I die.
We're not gonna let that happen.
You've gotta let them in.
- They have a federal warrant.
- Hide in the storage room.
Let's go.
Search the building.
Well, well, Dr. McGee.
It's been a while.
Not long enough, Powers.
- What's back there?
- A storage room.
- I'll check it out.
- I demand to know what this is all about!
We're looking for a woman named Alpha.
We know she just started working here.
We also know you were with her earlier this evening.
You were seen dancing together in a club.
As far as I know, dancing's no threat to national security.
If you know where she is, you'd better tell me now.
- We can't help you.
- What's your interest in her anyway?
- We want to talk to her.
- I remember how you talk to people.
As I recall, your way of asking questions needs some social refinement.
I don't have to justify myself to you or to anybody.
There's nobody back there.
I've got a word of advice for you, McGee:
- Stay away from me on this one.
- It's clear back there too.
Let's move out.
She's gone.
Must've climbed out a window.
Barry, whoever or whatever she is, she needs our help.
I know.
I'll search the streets.
Hey, hey, check it out.
Hey, old man.
Okay.
Out kind of late, ain't you, grandpa?
Look, fellas, I just want-
Now give me your wallet, and maybe I won't slice you up like a loaf of bread!
I don't have any money.
- Too bad.
- Let him go.
Look at this.
I think I'm in love.
- I don't wanna fight you.
- Who said anything about fighting?
Come on, honey.
Thanks.
Cops.
We'd better not let them find us here.
Look, I got a place nearby.
This used to be a nice neighborhood.
Those punks really clipped me good.
I'm sure glad you came along, kid.
- What are these?
- Cards.
You know, poker, blackjack, like that.
Where you from, the center of the Earth?
Cards.
You ever hear of three-card monte?
You got any money?
Figures.
Okay, look.
That's the queen of hearts.
Watch.
Find the queen.
Beginner's luck.
Let's try again.
Okay.
- How'd you do that?
- My optical circuits are equipped...
- ... with x-ray vision.
- Yeah, right.
Look, kid, if you got x-ray eyes what color undershorts am I wearing?
Red.
Look, I gotta go out for a little while.
You make yourself at home, okay?
And don't go anyplace.
I've been all over the city.
I can't find a sign of her.
I found something.
I've been studying Alpha's x-ray.
It's incredible.
Electronically, biomechanically, she's a miracle.
Except for this.
- What is it?
- It's a ball of plastic explosive...
- ... in the middle of her memory circuits.
- A bomb.
- What's it doing there?
- I think it's a self-destruct device.
If anything goes wrong, she could be destroyed.
She was here trying to find a way to disconnect it.
If Powers thinks she'll lose Alpha, she may press the button.
A bomb like this could kill a lot of people, Barry.
Tina McGee.
- It's for you.
- Me?
- Hello.
- It's Fosnight.
- I been calling all over trying to find you.
- What's so important?
I told you I owed you one.
You know that skirt you were with at the club?
Yeah, I can't find her anywhere.
Yeah, well, she's with me.
And there's something weird about her.
- Where are you?
- My apartment.
912 Stone Avenue.
I'll meet you out front.
I'm on my way.
We've got a location.
I need an ETA on Omega's arrival.
Sergeant Powers, Dr. Rossick and Omega left about 15 minutes ago.
They should be in Central City within the hour.
Good.
- You made good time.
- Where is she?
Down here.
Alpha, Tina and I want to help.
- We know about the bomb inside you.
- Bomb?
Did I hear "bomb"?
- That's why you came to Star Labs?
- Yes.
You were trying to disconnect it.
But it's wired directly into my memory circuits.
And if the bomb's not removed properly, it'll detonate.
Excuse me.
Detonate?
Allen, what the hell's going on here?
Fosnight, Alpha's not exactly what she seems.
- She's a robot.
- A robot?
Yeah.
No, no, that's gears and levers and built like a ringer washer.
- Alpha's built like a-
- Woman.
That's the idea.
Listen, come back to Star Labs with me, all right?
I know I'm human but trust me.
- All right.
- Okay.
- Thanks, Fosnight.
- Yeah, sure.
No, it's...
You humans are very strange creatures.
The more I learn from you, the more you puzzle me.
- In what way?
- You have the greatest gift the universe has to offer, life, and yet all you seem to do is complain and argue and fight with each other.
Barry!
It paralyzes the nervous system.
Don't make us hurt you, Alpha.
We just wanna reconstruct some of your circuits.
Take me back and make me a machine?
- You are a machine.
- No.
- I'm alive.
I'm a woman, just like you.
- I hardly think so, Alpha.
Why did you make me this way?
Why did you make me feel and think and respond?
We can discuss this back at the lab with Dr. Rossick.
- I'm not going with you.
- Listen to me, Alpha.
You're expensive equipment.
We'd rather have you back in one piece.
But if you walk away from me, I will push this button and you will be nothing more than a handful of nuts and bolts.
Run!
Stop her!
Let's get him inside for questioning.
The residual effects of the paralysis should wear off in about an hour.
- Did you find Alpha?
- No, but Omega's here.
Good.
Let me introduce the next generation in our android series:
Omega.
Faster, stronger, smarter.
And he lacks the annoying habit of making his own decisions.
Powers, I protest.
Omega isn't ready to be field-tested yet.
Yes, well, you're not running this project, Dr. Rossick.
I am.
And unless you'd like to be reassigned to Antarctica I suggest you cooperate.
Omega, find Alpha and bring her back.
I'm always fascinated at how pliable and fragile the human psyche is.
What's wrong?
I don't know.
It's some kind of a seizure.
- His heart's racing like a train.
- Look, help me lift him up.
We can't have him dying till he tells us what we need to know.
Hurry.
This should help you burn the drug out of your system.
Thanks.
Now I've gotta find Alpha before Powers and her men do.
If another android can track her she must have a signal we can lock on to.
The problem is how to isolate it.
Fosnight, I'm glad you're here.
I needed to borrow your tools to make an adjustment in my optical circuit.
Oh, my God!
Allen was on the square.
You are a damn machine.
Please don't be frightened.
I'm not.
It's just so...
- Better?
- Yeah, better.
So who are these people that are after you?
They work for the government.
Hey, say no more.
Anybody being chased by the feds is okay in my book.
Look, you gotta get out of town, kid, and fast.
- You got a car?
- No.
- And no money either, right?
- No.
All right, we gotta figure out a way to get you some cash real quick.
I got it.
You know that trick where you see through the cards?
- Could you do that again?
- Of course.
My emergency fund.
You pulled me out of a real jam, so I figure I owe you.
- I don't understand.
- You will.
You ever hear of something called poker?
Let me tell you all about it.
Cards.
Remember these?
There's 52 of them in a deck.
There's four suits:
Clubs, diamonds, hearts, spades.
Gentlemen, the name of the game is five-card stud.
Let's play cards.
It's Fosnight.
I gotta talk to Joey C.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but you got an empty chair at the table?
Come on.
You're a little out of your tax bracket, Fosnight.
Deal them.
Actually, it's a friend who wants to play.
Well, as long as he's got you for a reference.
Vernon, are the cards stuck together?
Her name is Alpha.
A very wise man once said that poker should not be played with women in the house.
- Are your fingers busted, or what?
- Get modern, Joey.
Or you afraid maybe she'll flatten your wallet?
Hey, I don't mind taking money from a broad.
Sit down, sweetheart.
Gold's 100, blue's 500, green's a grand.
How many you want?
- That's all you got?
- That's all she'll need.
Deal the lady in, Vernon.
Fosnight, you're making me very nervous.
There it is!
A faint radioactive trace from Alpha's power source.
Where is she?
- Hotel Infantino.
I'm on my way.
- Barry, wait!
I'm getting another signal.
Identical to Alpha's.
It's Omega.
He's closing in on her.
Three nines.
Just a minute.
That's the eighth hand in a row that you've won.
Do you know what the odds are against that?
If you give me the data, I can calculate them for you.
- What?
- Relax, Joey.
- It's a friendly game.
- I'm being friendly.
I just wanna know how come she manages to win every hand.
I can see through the cards.
What?
You have two kings an ace, a jack and a four.
She's a good guesser.
Come on, Joey, it's just a little joke.
It's a gag, that's all!
- Is there something wrong?
- Nothing a little cement couldn't cure.
Answer that.
I'll take care of this worm.
- Alpha, I'm here to take you back.
- I don't wanna go.
I'm taking you back.
No, you're not.
- Police!
Nobody move!
- Look!
It's the Flash!
Come on!
Come on!
What the hell is going on here?
Okay.
Let's do this one more time.
- You are not a human being?
- That's right.
I'm an android.
- A what?
- An android?
A synthetic human, like in all those stories by Isaac Asimov?
Yes.
You read Asimov too?
- Oh, I love Asimov.
- Bellows, do you mind?
- You're a robot?
- Just like the one you found in the hotel.
That was some kind of goofy mannequin without a head.
- It was a robot too?
- Yes.
And I'm the Tin Woodsman, and this is Munchkinland.
Bellows, call County General and ask them to send over a psychiatrist.
How about a mechanic?
Maybe she's just a quart low.
- Lieutenant, she's telling the truth.
- Allen.
What do you know about all this?
That she's exactly what she told you, an android created by the government.
She escaped because she doesn't want to be used as a weapon.
I think you better tell me the whole story.
From the beginning.
That won't be necessary.
Lieutenant, I'm Colonel Powers, NSIA.
I have a federal warrant remanding this woman into my custody.
I think you'll find everything's in order.
You can't turn her over.
They wanna reprogram her.
There's nothing I can do.
It's a federal warrant.
- It's the same thing as murder.
- Stay out of this, Allen.
- All right, Alpha.
- No, I won't-
Alpha!
We know your destruct frequency.
We have another transmitter.
- You're coming with us.
- Let's go.
Let me make something clear, Powers.
I don't like government-intelligence types or the way you walk over the law.
You or your people so much as commit a traffic violation on the way out of my city, I'll throw you in jail!
You understand?
It's been a pleasure doing business with you, lieutenant.
Come on.
You should have seen her eyes when they were taking her away.
It was like watching a person who knew she was going to die.
Barry, we've got to do something.
Legally, Alpha may be government property, but I know she's alive.
She has feelings, emotions.
They're just gonna kill her.
We can't just stand by.
It's not that easy, Tina.
They're holding her inside an NSIA facility.
They've got more security than Fort Knox.
Even I can't get past it.
Maybe you could with a little help.
First, we have to isolate the decision-making circuits and then disconnect them.
This should be a good place to tap into their system.
You were right.
They've got an incredible security system:
Electrified fences, mines, laser beams.
You're never gonna get through that.
Then what do we do?
Maybe I can penetrate their security computer.
The problem is in the decision-making circuits of the main memory core.
What we have to do is eliminate them.
And then we can reprogram the memory using the newer, updated Omega version.
I'm in!
Tina, you're beautiful.
It's about time you noticed.
Now let's see if we can make them think they're being invaded.
This is Powers.
What's the problem?
Yeah, we've got an intruder showing on the grid in Sector Four but according to security, there's no one there.
Check the system.
Don't worry.
You won't feel a thing.
How do you know what I feel?
- This is Powers.
What's the problem?
- Same problem, ma 'am.
We've got an intruder in Sector Seven...
- ... but our patrols don't see anything.
- Get the damn thing fixed.
First, we have to isolate the decision-making circuits and then disconnect them.
- This had better be good.
- We've got alarms going off all over.
According to the computer, we're being invaded!
Look, obviously there's something faulty in your security system.
I don't wanna be disturbed anymore.
Do you understand?
Shut it down.
- They turned it off.
- I knew you could do it.
It'll take them about three minutes to find they've been penetrated.
I'll be back in two.
All right.
We've isolated the decision-making circuit.
Run the memory-erase program.
- Hello.
- Hello.
Hey!
This is Powers.
The Flash has penetrated the facility.
I want you to reactivate all the security systems.
I want him stopped.
I'm sorry, ma 'am.
They've already made it through Gate Four.
Tina, can you access their security files?
- I think so.
- Erase them.
- Oh, my God.
- What?
All of our research files.
Somebody's deleting them.
Damn them.
Powers!
No!
Powers, stop it!
Look!
If you destroy Alpha, you'll kill everybody within 50 yards of her!
Yes, I know.
- Oh, no.
- Alpha, what's wrong?
The self-destruct mechanism.
It's been triggered.
There'll be another signal in 30 seconds to detonate it.
- God!
- I've gotta get out of here...
- ... or you'll both be killed.
- Wait!
Tina, what's the range of the destruct signal?
I'm not sure.
Ten miles, maybe more.
- I'll have to chance it.
- Chance what?
Outrunning it.
- The countdown's been negated.
- Yeah?
You outran the signal.
I spoke to a friend of mine at Star Labs East.
She found you a position in the Research Department.
She'll also protect your true identity.
And Rossick and Powers will be too busy explaining how they lost eight years of data to come after you.
Do you think it's wise to let Fosnight take Alpha to the airport?
- Sure, he's grown very attached to her.
- Yeah, that's what worries me.
- Hey, Allen.
McGee.
- Hey.
- I got your plane ticket.
You all set, kid?
- Yes.
Thank you for everything you've done.
- You've given me my life.
- It's a pleasure.
There are advantages to being an android but sometimes I wish I was human.
You ain't the only one, stretch.
Look, maybe we better get a move on.
Fosnight, I think you've made a mistake with my ticket.
- What do you mean?
- My x-ray circuits can see it in your pocket, and it doesn't say New York.
Let me see that.
Las Vegas.
- Two tickets.
- Hey, it's just a little detour.
So sue me.
Dr. McGee, I believe we'll all be taking a little trip to the airport.
Please don't be too hard on him, Barry.
He can't fight his nature.
- Told you so.
- Alpha, you're a real piece of work.
Thank you.
I can't wait to meet next year's model.

JULIO:
I tried flowers.
Maybe I should get something else.
BARRY:
Everywhere you go, you hear about the Trickster.
Sabrina bitches how I work all the time.
So we go out, right?
Bump into an ex-girlfriend, now she thinks I'm cheating.
Today begins the trial of James Montgomery Jessie.
A multiple personality wanted for murder Jessie adopted the persona of the costumed psychopath known as the Trickster.
His days of violent mayhem in Central City were ended by fem private eye Megan Lockhart.
[SIREN WAILS]
[CHATTERING]
[TRICKSTER LAUGHING]
TRICKSTER:
Accept no substitutes, ladies and gentlemen.
I am the genuine article.
I'm gonna make this city very sorry it ever crossed me.
Well, Barry Allen.
I'm gonna make you pay too, Allen.
You and your little cupcake girlfriend, Megan Lockhart.
And the Flash, the big red freak he'll pay the going rate 10 times over because nobody tricks the Trickster.
Nobody!
[LAUGHING]
MURPHY:
The last time we pulled this kind of duty was at that concert at Crystal Beach.
No kidding.
I hear they're scalping tickets for seats outside.
They're welcome to mine.
There's lots of places I'd rather be.
Don't worry, there's no way the Trickster's gonna walk.
I'm not so sure.
He's got this hotshot lawyer defending him, Denise Cowan.
Cowan?
Didn't she get that Wall Street guy acquitted of murder?
- And they had videotapes of him doing it.
- Well, I'm glad I got front-row seats.
Well, at least Megan will be back in town.
I just want to testify and get out of here.
- I don't think it's gonna be that easy.
KLINE:
Barry Allen.
You were nearly drowned by the Trickster because of your involvement with private eye Megan Lockhart.
Any comment?
- No.
- Are you gonna stand in the way of journalist inquiry, of the people's right to know?
- It's un-American.
- Kline, you're making me nauseous.
Hey, Bar, if you don't tell your side of things Kline will put words in your mouth.
It's self-defense.
Come on, Bar.
Well, uh, it all came to a head in the prop warehouse.
- Um, where Jessie knocked me out--
- Forget about him.
There she is!
Megan Lockhart.
The detective responsible for bringing the Trickster to justice.
She was kidnapped and forced to wear the costume of the Trickster's fantasy sidekick, Prank.
How does it feel to be the woman who stole the Trickster's heart?
I didn't steal anything.
It just kept coming gift-wrapped COD.
And I had help taking Jessie down--
There must have been something to make the Trickster so hot to trot.
- How far did you go to get your man?
- You have got to be kidding me.
I never kid, babe.
Look, I'll try to squeeze you all in, okay?
BARRY:
Think you can squeeze me in?
- Get in line, fella.
Megan.
Barry.
Hi!
You look great.
I've never seen you--
[PAGER BEEPING]
Oh, my secretary again.
- You have a secretary now?
- It has been insane since we brought the Trickster in.
I have been turning down clients.
Which is, um, why I haven't written lately, and I'm really sorry.
Can this reunion take five, because we have a deadline.
- Thank you.
- Uh, later, boys.
We'll have time for pictures and statements after the hearing.
- Look, just get-
- Megan-- MEGAN:
I'll see you inside.
MAN 1:
--on how this case is going to shape up?
MAN 2:
Excuse me.
MAN 1:
Being that it's just kicking off....
Not quite the reunion I'd imagined.
You have to-- You have to let me in.
You just have to.
I'm carrying the Trickster's child.
You're just gonna have to carry him right back where you came from, lady.
TRICKSTER:
You call this a trial?
This is nothing more than a kangaroo court without the hoppy, furry guy.
- Order, order!
- If I were behind the bench, maybe--
Jessie, please!
Ms. Cowan, if you cannot control your client...
- ...
I'm gonna have him restrained.
- Restrained?
What do you call these, costume jewelry?
Jessie, shut up!
It's bad enough you insist on wearing this ridiculous outfit in court.
Don't blow this for both of us.
What, and disappoint my loyal fans?
You don't have loyal fans.
The only person on your side is me!
And that's starting to look like a real bad career move.
Your Honor, defense requests a change of venue.
- Are you nuts?
- I see no way that my client...
- ...can get a fair trial in Central City.
TRICKSTER:
Leave Central City?
You are crazy.
I love this town.
And it loves me.
Look what I've done for it.
COWAN:
Your Honor.
That is it.
You are in contempt of this court.
No!
I'll tell you who's in contempt.
This courtroom is in contempt.
The entire judicial system is in contempt.
North America, the land mass, is in contempt.
Jessie, get a grip!
You're losing it!
Nuh-uh, I'm perfectly sane.
I am the Trickster.
And you!
Pretending to be Prank when you were never my loyal sidekick.
JUDGE:
Bailiff!
This is all your fault!
[PEOPLE GASPING]
You're getting to be a drag, Jessie.
And I am bored stiff.
[TRICKSTER GRUNTING]
Megan attacked The Trickster.
He's down.
If I don't get complete silence, I'm going to empty this courtroom.
I'm gonna wave bail pending psychiatric evaluation.
This court is recessed until 9 a.m. Monday morning.
MAN:
Get him out of here!
KLINE:
A few questions for the people out there--
- I'm sorry, not now.
I'm sorry.
- He's too good for you, tramp!
- No, not now, really.
- Megan!
TINA:
With Jessie in custody and Megan in town no one's talking about the Flash anymore.
I'm not sure I like that.
- Joe Kline would kill for an interview.
- I don't want attention that much.
- Would you like another?
- No.
Thanks.
- It's funny, don't you think?
- What?
A year ago, you came to me wanting to get rid of these powers.
Who'd have thought we'd be sitting here now, talking about the Flash's publicity?
Well, one thing hasn't changed.
I'm still a bottomless pit.
In the last year, I've gone near bust on food alone.
Thanks.
I'm lying to everyone I know about my nights.
But, Barry, look at the good you've done.
You stopped the Trickster's rampage.
Well, I think I'm a little fed up with my own multiple personality.
Maybe I'll go public.
Make us both famous.
I and my faithful and beautiful companion Christina McGee, am in reality-- Megan.
MEGAN:
Barry, Tina.
Small town, huh?
I saw you on the news.
I wish I had my autograph book on me.
Oh.
- You really charmed the press.
- I'm sorry about that, Barry.
- But they just won't leave me alone.
- Well, when are we getting together?
You know, I really wish I could say, but I am buried.
I-
- I'm meeting my agent for a drink.
Your agent?
This is a new you.
I'm getting book and movie offers out of nowhere.
As soon as things lighten up, I promise we'll get together.
- Yeah.
I'll check my schedule.
- Great.
I've gotta go.
I'm busy too, you know.
What's that about, McGee?
Megan, for a detective, sometimes you miss some pretty big clues.
I've already told you, counselor.
No.
No.
No!
Damn it, Jessie.
You are going to have to listen to me and follow my lead, or you can kiss any hope of acquittal goodbye.
So who the hell needs you anyway?
I've got law degrees too, you know.
- A whole trunk full of them.
MURPHY:
Mail call.
You're some lucky guy, Tricksy.
You've got a secret admirer.
Yep.
And one who's dead set on using up all the cheap perfume in town.
COWAN:
Is this the police department's idea of a joke?
BELLOWS:
No.
These were delivered by a bona fide representative of the U.S. Post Office.
Oh, boy.
This is disgusting.
- She's crazy about me.
- Yeah, well, you're half right anyway.
Counselor, visiting hours are over.
- Jessie, remember what I said.
- Yeah, yeah.
Maybe I should be defending myself.
Don't be a fool.
I can't help it.
[LAUGHING]
"I'll get you out.
Prank."
Prank?
BARRY:
You brought Sabrina here on a date?
Well, at least I'll be seen with her.
Maybe we'll run into one of his other old flames.
Look, I keep telling you, Sabrina.
Baby, Jinx and I are old news.
- Jinx?
- When I walked into that club...
- ...she was all over him like a cheap suit.
- You had a girlfriend named Jinx?
Oh, what's in a name?
JUDGE:
Mr. Jessie.
You understand that another outburst like Friday's will not be tolerated.
Your Honor, before we begin, my client would like to address the court.
JUDGE:
If the people have no objection.
FOREMAN:
The people have no objection.
Your Honor you can't imagine how sorry I am for what I've done.
But I am under the influence of demons inside me battling for my very soul.
I swear to you, if I could have stopped the killing, I would have.
But I'm so weak.
The others inside me are so strong.
- This is a load of--
- Shh.
TRICKSTER:
But I'm sorry.
[SOBBING] I'm really sorry.
Your Honor, my client can't....
What the hell is that?
JUDGE:
I will not have my courtroom turned into a circus.
Bailiff, get rid of that teddy bear!
[LAUGHING]
TRICKSTER:
Laughing gas.
COWAN:
You can't go.
You're gonna blow this case.
TRICKSTER:
Whose side are you on anyway?
Sacrificing yourself for a lawyer?
- Time to rethink your priorities, bub.
ZOEY:
No time.
Let's go.
[MEGAN COUGHING]
BARRY:
He's gone.
MEGAN:
No, not again.
MAN:
What happened in there?
JULIO:
I'm sorry.
Please, just try the pound.
I'm sure they'll be able to find--
- Mendez!
- Yes, lieutenant.
I want everything on Jessie's love letters from his secret admirer.
- Chemical analysis, the works.
- I'm on the way.
You.
I want you to get ahold of your girlfriend.
This time, she gets police protection.
Jessie's got a better shot at getting to Megan these days than I do.
ZOEY:
Here we are.
Home sweet home.
TRICKSTER:
Home?
MAN:
Taxi.
ZOEY:
After Daddy died, I moved out of the estate and into the apartments here on the top floor.
Zoey Clark.
Clarx Toys' Clark.
I love your stuff!
GI Johnny, OMA.
[SINGING IN UNISON] One Man Army
Oh.
When I saw you on TV, I knew I had found a kindred spirit.
No one gets you but me.
I've spent my entire life looking for bigger and bigger kicks.
Weeklong parties joy riding shoplifting burglary, arson grand theft.
An impressive résumé.
And you are the ultimate thrill.
There's no denying that.
I can't believe I finally got the Trickster.
Forget the Trickster.
He's old news.
Perhaps next time I'll become...
[IN RUSSIAN ACCENT] ...Vladimir Jessinsky, concert pianist, da?
Forget Vladimir!
I want the Trickster.
That tramp Megan Lockhart never deserved to wear this.
But I do.
Aren't you glad to see your little sidekick, Prank?
Prank.
Prank!
Prank?
Yeah, baby, it's Prank.
And you're the Trickster.
Trickster.
Prank.
Thank heaven you got here in time.
Oh, Trickster, you're the best.
Forget the mushy stuff.
There is so much I have to do.
And I won't make the same mistakes twice.
Whatever you need, I can get for you.
- Anything?
- Anything.
[LAUGHING]
TRICKSTER:
I have always wanted one of these.
ZOEY:
Whoo!
Perfect!
The gall of this third-rate metropolis, putting me on trial.
I'd do anything for you, Trickster.
Anything.
It's time we made that red-suited goon pay.
And Megan too.
This time I take no prisoners and post no bills.
[LAUGHING]
Guess what, Central City, the Trickster's back.
And I've got him.
MEGAN:
Don, can this not wait till I get back?
[PHONES RINGING]
Wait.
Just hold on one second.
Hello?
Danny, I told you, quit bugging me.
Hello?
Yeah, Paul, I need to speak with you.
Hold on.
Hello?
Don, I'll get back to you.
Okay.
Melanie, where is that package I asked you for?
- Wow.
This must have cost a bundle.
- Comped by the hotel.
Yeah, Paul.
I got that fax you sent me, and the terms are totally unacceptable.
Hold all of Ms. Lockhart's calls, please.
Thank you.
- Hey, what's the big idea?
- All I've gotten from you is a busy signal.
I am trying to handle the agency in San Francisco...
- ...and juggle the media at the same time.
- I'm delighted.
You've got a bigger problem than your career.
MEGAN:
The Trickster?
Huh, don't I know it.
This came for me special delivery this afternoon.
BARRY:
And you opened it without calling the bomb squad or me?
Relax, Barry, I'm a pro.
I made sure it wasn't a bomb.
Check it out.
Dead rat?
"Some discoloration may occur after dying.
Love, the Trickster.
P.S., give my best to the Flash."
- Cute, huh?
- We'll get you round-the-clock protection.
I have all the protection I need, thank you.
Megan, save the Sam Spade crap for the press, all right?
- Jessie almost killed both of us.
- Barry, I can handle this.
Oh, so you don't want me around.
Actually, I've given it a lot of thought.
How would you like to move to San Francisco?
- What?
- I mean, go into partnership with me in the agency.
- The agency?
- Well, think about it, Barry.
No more being stuck behind test tubes in the lab.
All the hyperspeed street work you want.
- Plus you get paid really well for it.
- I like those test tubes.
Okay.
Well, think about it.
Let me know.
So now on to Jessie.
No offense, but the cops don't seem to be getting results.
Here's a list of possible hideouts.
Warehouses, theaters, amusement parks.
You do the legwork, and I'll track the phony stenographer.
If I need to reach you, I'll call you.
Oh, and I need a national check on all female mental patient escapees.
- You have better access at the station.
- Oh, so I'm working for you?
I figured if we're tracking the Trickster, I should coordinate.
You assume a lot.
This has to do with the fact that I left town, doesn't it?
Look, Barry, I know we have a lot to talk about.
I'll find him myself.
You did it again, Megan.
[BELL RINGS]
ZOEY:
Okay, ready in the booth.
Ready on cameras.
Four, three, two....
- You're on the air.
- And we are back.
So, what you're saying, babe is since your partner died, things have just not been the same.
Let's face it, babe, this dog pile of a city refuses to recognize genius.
Now let's cut to the chase and get down to the heart of the matter.
Come on, speed-o, let's forget about the little Lockhart twist.
We both know I'm gonna kill her sooner or later.
Unless I decide....
MEGAN:
Jessie, you are unbelievable.
So I'm calling you out, babe.
Just you and me.
The final showdown.
The Thriller in Manila.
- She said what to you tonight?
- That woman aggravates me.
- I don't work for her.
- At least she's mistreating you.
Sabrina won't even talk to me.
TRICKSTER [ON TV]:
The Flash versus the Trickster in a final ground-pounding asphalt-churning, nitro-burning duel of the titans.
You know where, babe.
It's time Central City started recognizing its real heroes.
You know what I mean?
Good.
Now get out of here.
I love you.
You're beautiful.
Does Kline need a new makeup man, or what?
[GRUNTING]
Not now, babe.
[DUMMY SNEEZES]
[SNEEZING]
[LAUGHING]
How reality stinks.
That's why I try and improve on it whenever I can.
Well, what do you think?
Not too subdued?
[SNEEZING]
Cheap harlot!
Hey!
Get them off me!
Get them off me!
TRICKSTER:
Who wants gum?
ZOEY:
I do.
I do.
- Are you okay?
- No.
But go get them.
TRICKSTER:
You see, it's that little touch of epoxy in the gum that does the trick.
[LAUGHING]
Shoes.
Mallet.
Are we gonna kill him?
No.
I have a much more interesting idea.
Right, old buddy?
Right.
[CHUCKLES]
Mm.
Good morning, sunshine!
It's a beautiful day in my neighborhood.
Won't you be my neighbor?
- Stop it, Jessie.
- The Trickster to you.
And I'm Prank.
- I thought Megan was Prank.
- I'm Prank!
Me!
And don't you forget it.
[TRICKSTER STAMMERING]
- But don't you wanna see who--?
- He is the mask.
Without the mask, he's nothing.
Bupkes, nada, zip.
Just some boring, average, insignificant jerk nobody cares about who'll die alone and forgotten watching game shows in an empty apartment with cats.
So you touch that mask again, I'll murder you!
Okay?
Women.
- So, what are you gonna do, kill me?
- Oh!
The last thing I want is you dead.
[CHUCKLING]
With a little help, you'll come around to my way of thinking.
[LAUGHING]
We're gonna have so much fun together once I reprogram your brain.
[GARBLED AUDIO PLAYS ON TELEVISIONS]
TRICKSTER [ON TV]:
Come to me.
[LAUGHING]
Mine.
Yes, you are.
Come, Flash.
Oh, Flashie-poo.
[SCREAMING]
Oh, stop it, stop it, stop it!
He is such a baby.
- What are we gonna do now, Trickster?
- We?
As in, you and me?
Hey, reality check, sweetie pie.
You can't begin to understand the depth and genius of my plans.
Besides, it's guy stuff.
[MACHINE RATTLING]
I will make this bug house of a city pay for the indignity it's laid at my feet with the help of you my pal the Flash.
I blame myself, Tina.
I blew it.
I was so caught up in paperwork and promotions, I lost my edge.
Don't be silly.
We're dealing with a dangerous lunatic here who seems to be getting help from this Prank.
I'm so stupid.
I mean, I care about Barry.
And somehow we never even got a chance to talk.
And now Jessie's got him.
He's got radios in those wings of his, doesn't he?
The transceivers proved too sensitive for hyperspeed.
- And Barry hated them anyway.
- Hated being on a leash, I bet.
I could track his heat patterns.
I'd have to tap into the satellite system.
It would take time, and it's not legal either.
Maybe I should have offered you the partnership.
- Partnership?
- Tina, Barry is bigger than forensics.
And I could really use his help in San Francisco.
- He's considering the offer?
- Besides you, what's keeping him here?
Barry does not stay in Central City on my account.
We are just good friends.
It's not like that.
Face it, McGee, you two are a team, romantic or otherwise.
[LAUGHING]
[SCREAMING]
Hey, dude, your hand is, like, smoking.
Thanks, partner.
That's enough.
You're under arrest.
You too, Flash.
Don't move, or I'll shoot!
What are you wearing?
- Put it down.
- Come on.
Come on.
It's not guns that kill people, it's these little hard things.
[TRICKSTER AND FLASH LAUGHING]
Hey, partner, got a match?
- Left them in my other suit.
- No problemo.
Yes!
Yes!
Go!
Go!
Go!
Ah!
Too safe and too sane.
Oop.
Wrong one.
Murph, come on.
Come on, Murph!
- Murph!
TRICKSTER:
Whoo!
Whoo!
Beautiful.
Wait till you see what else I got lined up.
FLASH:
I love that guy.
I can't believe it, Murph.
The Flash has gone bad.
[LAUGHING]
I thought you guys were gonna wait for me.
- We were having way too much fun.
- You got that right, partner.
You said I could fire the candle.
Whine, whine, whine.
You're getting to be a real drag.
I've had enough of your mewling and puking.
Hey, forget about the ball and chain.
What next?
Well, I figure we drop the little woman off at home, then it's boys' night out.
Yes, Madam Mayor, I know he's fast.
I don't know how.
I promise you, I am doing everything I can.
Everything!
Okay, the Flash and the Trickster have defaced a children's mural at the Civic they let out the poisonous snakes and dynamited the River Street Bridge.
Traffic's backed up to the state line, sir.
I have had better weeks.
Roberts, I want an APB on the Flash out on the wire now.
You notify the SWAT team we need heavy firepower.
Come on, Murph.
What?
We dig a trench, we put tar paper over it.
The Flash hits that, boom, we got him.
Murphy, Bellows, how about earning your pay and hitting the streets!
- Yes, sir.
I'm driving.
BELLOWS:
Yes, sir!
Hey, has anybody seen Barry?
TRICKSTER:
You and me, pal.
We'll make this city pay.
They called us crazy, drove us out on the streets....
- Hey, this is great!
- They put us on trial.
- Now we'll make them think twice.
- Hey I could vibrate my fingers through somebody's brain.
Gross.
Well, maybe later.
But seriously, we are gonna put Central City on trial.
I'm ready to paint this town red.
Paint the town red!
Believe it or not, the Flash has joined the Trickster spreading violence and vandalism through the city.
Citizens have been asked to stay off the street.
The mayor is said to be requesting the National Guard to quell this crime wave.
MEGAN:
Sorry, Al.
The MAC 11s, did you trace them?
Bought by DLC Corporation.
A subsidiary of Clarx Toys.
Thanks, Al.
Everything the Trickster and this Prank nut have used comes from Clarx Toys.
How's your search going?
Getting into the tracking system is more difficult than I thought.
But there's a bigger problem.
He's done something to Barry's mind.
Maybe brainwashed him.
When we do find him, he won't be happy to see us.
Oh, great.
Not only are we up against the Trickster, but the Flash too.
If we're lucky the Trickster's programming won't be anything but superficial.
I think I can override it with an Army technique:
A shot of adrenaline to countermand the programming.
Good Lord, is there anything you don't know?
I wish I knew more.
Because if this doesn't work, Barry could die.
I think we should visit our local Clarx toy store.
Well, if it isn't the girl from court.
I'm not laughing now, babe.
- Who are you?
- Prank.
MEGAN:
Your real name.
- Zoey.
- Zoey what?
- Clark!
- Where's the Trickster?
- I hope he's all right.
- After what he's done to you?
Oh, brother.
Let me clue you in, honey.
I am way more unstable than you so you better tell me where he is right now.
Don't tell him I told you.
- He's putting the city on trial.
- Let's go, McGee.
Forget about her.
We gotta get to the courthouse.
The court of no recourse is now in session.
Could we have the theme, please?
[MUSIC PLAYING]
Will the accused come on down?
All right, kill the music.
What is the meaning of this outrage?
Jessie.
James, as your counsel, I strongly advise you against taking this action.
You're just like all the rest:
Manipulative, faithless, self-serving.
No use to me at all.
- You're fired!
- Ha!
Bailiff, read the charges.
"Central City and you, its representatives, are on trial for crimes against good taste."
And me.
- This is absurd!
- I'm sure I can get a continuance on this.
Was I talking to you?
Has the jury reached a verdict?
We have, Your Honor.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
Guilty.
They're guilty!
Guilty.
Guilty.
Any last words before I pronounce sentence?
And especially you!
Speechless with contrition, eh?
I find every last one of you guilty as sin and sentence you to death.
Are you prepared to carry out sentence, Mr. Executioner?
No.
I, uh, can't decide which to use.
Well, that's why they call me the hanging judge.
[LAUGHING]
Well, what's stopping you, palomino?
I can't move.
An attack of conscience, eh?
This had to be sooner or later.
I'm taking you in for good this time, Jessie.
You never let us have any fun.
You know who I am, and I know you're not a killer.
Of course you're a killer.
You're a freak of nature.
You can do whatever you want because you can get away with it!
Don't do it, red.
You're better than that.
You ruined everything!
Kill her!
Kill her already!
- You shot my partner!
- Barry, listen to me.
The Trickster tried to kill you and Megan.
He is not your partner, I am.
You know that!
We've been through hell together.
And I've always stood by you.
And I always will.
For as long as you want me to.
- Tina?
- Yeah.
Tina.
- Help!
- Jessie.
Body armor.
I'm not crazy, you know.
I've got a bomb and I will use it.
Let her go!
Megan, go after Jessie.
The Flash needs a few seconds to recover.
- Like hell I do.
- Relax.
Tina rewired that scooter of his.
TRICKSTER:
Aah!
Get in!
I like it.
TRICKSTER:
What is this?
ZOEY:
I had it made for you.
It's the great Trickster escape mobile.
For me?
Gee, after I treated you like dirt.
Hung you out to dry.
I love you madly.
That's why I had it equipped with all the options.
Oh, darling, it won't work.
I'm no good for you.
Besides, how can I miss you when you won't go away?
Aah!
Ha-ha-ha.
Good evening, my dear.
I'm Officer Murphy, and you are under arrest.
[LAUGHING]
Damn!
[GRUNTING]
Give it up, Jessie!
Join me in hell.
[LAUGHING]
[TRICKSTER LAUGHING]
Where's the Flash when you really need him?
Might break me out of here.
They think a padded cell can stop me.
How wrong they are.
This will be my polyfoam fortress.
They're in for such a big surprise.
Because nobody tricks the Trickster.
Nobody!
[LAUGHING]
Thanks, Tina.
If you hadn't shown up, I'd still be running around in those crazy boots.
What would I do without you?
Oh, I don't know.
Supermarket openings maybe.
Never.
JULIO:
Wow, I wish I'd have been in court.
No, you wanna stay far away from guys like Jessie.
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.
- Caught them out in the hallway.
- Julio left the concert tickets here.
Tickets?
I thought you were breaking up.
Well, we had a mature discussion about the direction of our relationship.
Yeah, he came back groveling on his hands and knees.
- We'd love to stay, but we got a date.
- Bye.
Bet those two don't make it out to the parking lot.
- So you're off to San Francisco.
- Yeah.
We have way too many goodbyes.
I left something burning at the lab.
I'll see you later.
We make a great team, Lockhart.
See you around.
Yeah, you too, McGee.
She's great.
I mean, not your average science type.
Tina's the best.
Look, before I put my foot in my mouth I think I owe you an apology.
I've been a little preoccupied lately.
- This I noticed.
- I'm really sorry, Barry.
I've just been trying to keep my head above water.
So, um, have you thought about my offer?
Megan, I would love to come to San Francisco with you.
- God, that's terrific!
Great, Barry.
- But-
- But I can't.
You can't?
No.
Central City's my home, you know?
My family is here.
My friends are here.
I'm just not ready to say goodbye.
My loss.
Well, I still have a few days before I have to head back.
Some of those long goodbyes.
More goodbyes?
[IN UNISON] Mm.
Hey, Allen.
We got work to do.
Subtitles by SDI Media Group
[ENGLISH SDH]
We've got a sworn statement from Caroline Larkin that you got her drunk and engaged in sexual relations with her in your lifeguard tower.
- Come here!
- I never touched you.
You know I never touched you!
You don't have to prove anything to me, Turner.
You don't need legs if you've got wings.
Fly on a day like today, you'll think you died and went to heaven.
Oh, my God!
How could you let him go?
The dude's a pro.
The dude's out of his mind!
"Last week on" Baywatch:
So, how long were they together?
They were pretty hot and heavy for about a year or so.
Before his accident.
You guys going to get together?
Mitch, he shut me out of his life when I wanted to be there for him.
He's got nothing to prove to me.
I'm just afraid he's here to prove something to himself.
15-year-old girls in floss bikinis, they only do what he says because he's cute.
You guys go to Pali?
I'm transferring there in the fall.
Like we care.
"I know what they're" after, Eddie.
- Oh, yeah, what?
- A trophy.
You can take it off me, if you want.
Change your clothes and get out.
You got 30 seconds.
We made it in his tower.
I just thought you should know that your daughter made it with that lifeguard in his tower last night.
I heard all about you and your lifeguard.
Come on, what am I being arrested for?
Statutory rape.
What!
?
Hey, Shauni, come on in.
Hey, Shauni, want a piece of fruit?
No thank you, Hobie.
What's wrong?
Eddie just got arrested.
What happened?
I don't know.
Garner said that a girl accused him of statutory rape.
Hobie...
I know what rape is, Dad.
Yeah, I know you do.
Just wait for me upstairs, will you?
Okay.
I'm sure Eddie didn't do anything wrong.
Come on and sit down.
I can't believe this is happening.
Garner say anything about the girl who filed the complaint?
No.
You know, yesterday,
I found a girl's bathing suit in Eddie's tower.
He said she asked him to let her change in there the day before.
Somebody he pulled out of the water.
Was it a one-piece bathing suit, black and gray?
Yeah.
The trophy hunter.
I knew it.
Is she underage?
16... 17, at the most.
Is she a regular out there?
A newcomer.
Probably wanted to get noticed.
Mitch, I warned him.
I told him what she was after, and he told me I was being jealous.
I knew it.
We've got a sworn statement from Caroline Larkin that you got her drunk and engaged in sexual relations with her in your lifeguard tower.
She's lying, all right?
I didn't touch her.
Why would she lie?
She's bragging.
Lifeguards are trophies.
Eddie, did you know she's 15 years old?
Yes.
Look, maybe you shouldn't waive your right to have an attorney present.
I don't need one, Garner.
I didn't do anything.
She swears you did.
Fine, then it's her word against mine.
That's right, the word of a street punk who was arrested twice as a juvenile for shoplifting and grand theft auto, violated probation...
The list goes on.
Well, it's an old list.
Yeah.
Right.
Thanks.
Eddie, Mitch and the guys have posted bail for you.
You're free to go.
You'll be arraigned within 48 hours, so don't make any vacation plans.
Eddie... get a good lawyer.
Eddie, I just want you to know that, as far as everybody here is concerned, you were set up.
But?
But... according to departmental regulations, you got to be suspended pending the outcome of an investigation.
I don't believe this.
You know something, Mitch?
If a stranger's out there drowning, everybody's on it.
If a guard needs help, backup comes from land, sea, and air, if he needs it.
But what if "he" really needs it, huh?
I mean, what if he's the one that's really in trouble?
Where's his backup, then?
Nowhere.
You're on your own, pal.
Sink or swim.
Wow...
Thanks a lot, Mitch.
You know what to say?
You say your story, that's all.
- Eddie?
- Why?
Why are you doing
- this to me?
- You stay away from my daughter!
Tell him you're lying.
Tell him!
- Take it easy, huh?
- Mitch, she's lying.
I never touched her.
She's a liar.
You're the one who's lying.
- Come here.
- I never touched you.
You "know" I never touched you.
Ron, get him downstairs.
Tell him.
You're a liar.
I want him arrested for assault.
You threw the first punch.
No, I want him arrested!
Calm down.
Come on, now.
Come in my office.
Did Mitch say how long you'd be suspended?
Indefinitely, or until something goes better for me, which will never happen.
Nobody thinks you did it, Eddie.
You pulled your hand awfully quick when you found out what Garner said, huh?
That was a reflex.
I'm sorry.
I wish I could take it back.
Yeah.
You know, something goes wrong, bust me.
Blame me for everything...
isn't that right, Shauni?
Don't pull away from me, please.
What's the point, huh?
Your old man is gonna stop you from seeing me as soon as he finds out.
I'm not going to let him.
Eddie, come on...
You don't get it, do you?
You don't get it.
It's the story of my life.
I don't know who the hell's writing this damn thing, but it ain't gonna be a happy ending, so get out while you can.
Don't leave.
Eddie, where you going?
Find someplace where I can breathe.
I'm at the end of my ramp.
Turner, I don't know what I'm supposed to do.
I'm not sure what you want.
What I want?
How about a time machine?
I wish I could make one for you.
You can.
Shall we arm wrestle?
Megan.
You wouldn't see me, so I came to see you.
I thought you might be getting chilly, so I brought you
- some tea.
- Thanks.
Rob, this is Eric Turner.
Eric, this is Rob Carlton.
Pleased to meet you.
Hope you brought Sweet Low.
What?
About three packs?
Right?
Actually, I take it plain now.
Amazing how things change.
Would you like some?
It's chamomile.
No, thanks.
I'd better go.
Let me give you a hand.
Get your hands off me!
Turner.
Mr. Buchannon?
Mr. Buchannon?
Dr. Kinnon.
How's he doing?
Well, he's stable.
In fact, he's strong, considering what he's undergone.
Can I see him?
Sure, but I want to make you aware first.
I just told Eric his condition.
Which is?
Fragments of bone have impinged his spinal cord.
He's paralyzed from the waist down.
What?
Well... what about rehabilitation and, you know, physical therapy?
No.
I'm afraid that the paralysis is irreversible.
Come on, Doctor.
This guy's an athlete.
I'm sorry.
I'm very sorry.
Hey, Mitch.
It's good to see you.
Meg snuck this in to me.
Can't live without my music.
Great.
How you feeling?
Like racing.
The doc says I won't be able to do it for a while.
Dr. Kinnon?
Yeah.
Well, he used the word "never," but, uh... he doesn't know the heart of a lifeguard like we do, does he?
No, he doesn't.
Right.
Hey, you'd better keep working out because I'm going to beat you.
Well... it won't be the first time, will it?
Who won the overall?
Sorry to tell you this.
Zuma.
All right!
Ah, Megan's downstairs and a whole bunch of other people.
They're all dying to see you.
Are you up to that?
I mean... can I bring them up?
Yeah.
A victory party.
Let's do it.
Hey, Mitch...
Do me a favor, Mitch.
Get rid of that thing for me, will you?
You got it.
It's out of here.
Shauni?
What are you doing here?
It's pretty late, isn't it?
I'm just hoping Eddie shows up.
Take it easy.
Eddie's not the first lifeguard this has happened to.
I know.
I remember what happened to Craig.
It also happened to me.
Quite a few years ago.
What happened?
It was summer, '63...
Beach Boy music, little surfer girls running all over the place.
Anyway... three girls made a bet on who was going to win my affection.
At the end of summer, they all claimed victory.
So, what did you do?
I got them all together.
I confronted them, and the truth won out.
Like it always does.
So Eddie's gonna be all right, he's gonna get through it.
I know.
It just hurts that he wants to get through it by himself.
No.
He wants to get through it with you.
He just needs more time.
You really think so?
I know so.
All right, you go on home.
'Cause if Eddie calls, or shows up here, I'm gonna hog-tie him, then I'm gonna call you.
Go on.
Thank you.
You're the best.
So, as soon as the wind switches onshore,
- we're out there.
- All right!
Take off from right over there
- then we're gone.
- That sounds good.
Then we'll grab a surf after we eat if there's any waves.
Hey, guys, what's the problem.
Huh?
How come you're sitting around on your butts?
What, it's a little too blown out for you?
Nah, it's not flyable in this wind.
Smash you right into the rocks, man.
Only if you give in to it.
Let me use your rig.
Bip.
Come on, I'll show you how to have the flight of your life, man.
Come on, it will be an adrenaline rush that will make you pop.
Sure.
Why not?
Normal.
Fly on a day like today, you'll think you died and went to heaven.
Oh, my God.
Yeah, patch me through to Mitch, and hurry.
Those are odious winds, man.
What are you trying to prove?
That you don't need legs if you got wings.
You sure you're ready for this?
You bet.
All right, man.
Here we go.
Let's go!
IAdios, amigos!
How could you let him go?
Hey, the dude's a pro.
The dude's out of his mind!
Damn it!
I need your glider.
Sure.
Is he okay?
He's okay.
Hey.
Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey.
No luck, huh?
I have been driving around all night, Mitch.
I'm worried about him.
You know how he gets.
Yeah.
Do you know where that girl works?
Yeah.
She works at the boathouse restaurant on the pier.
I know you're worried about Eddie, but he'll be all right.
Where else is he going to go?
Turner, look at me.
Look at me!
No, you look at me!
Nobody looks at me.
They look at me and they see something else.
They don't see who I am.
I'm just afraid of becoming what people see.
Well, I don't buy that.
You know what I see?
That you're trying to prove something.
You don't have to prove anything to me, Turner.
Look, Meg...
when I came back,
I didn't expect you to still be in love with me.
But then I saw you, and... a- a-and all the memories started... coming back.
Suddenly I felt like maybe things could be like they were.
When you got hurt all I could think about was you... what could I do for you?
I would have sacrificed everything to be there for you, but you totally shut me out.
I just didn't want to put you through my pain.
Don't you think that should have been my decision?
No!
It had to be mine!
Like it's my decision to go back to San Diego tomorrow.
But the job, it will be good for you...
I can't handle the job, Meg!
Yes, you can.
No, I can't!
Don't do this to me!
I'll still be here for you, Turner, anytime you need a friend.
And what if I need more than a friend?
I don't know, Turner.
I just don't know.
Your move.
It's my buddy.
Well, I am your friend.
A real friend wouldn't have turned his back on me.
Eddie, people are looking for you, you know?
They're worried.
Tell them you found me and I'm doing just fine.
You know, you must have been real good at track at school.
Yeah, what the hell's that supposed to mean?
You're always running.
Mitch, I didn't deserve what happened to me, okay?
Oh, give me a break.
Who deserves anything?
You think Turner deserved what happened to him?
At least you can run.
Well, I guess I'm lucky.
Lucky?
You're blessed.
You've got someone in this world who really cares about you.
Don't blow it with her.
Hey, Mitch.
What?
You know where she is?
Yeah, she's headed towards the pier.
Caroline?
My name's Shauni.
Your boss said you were out here.
You're Eddie's girlfriend.
You seen him?
Not since yesterday.
Well, I think that you and I need to talk.
Well, look, my dad's going to be here any minute.
Well, that doesn't give us much time then, does it?
Please, just leave me alone.
Caroline, look, I know how hard it is to be the new girl on the beach.
And, believe me, I know how important it is to be accepted.
Sooner or later, you're going to have to tell the truth.
Because the longer you put it off, the more people you're gonna hurt.
All you want is to get your boyfriend off the hook.
You don't care about me.
That's not true.
I do care.
Nobody does.
Caroline, come on...
My father thinks I'm a whore.
Listen, if you just tell the truth, then he won't.
Then everyone will know I'm nothing.
I'm nothing.
I'm nothing!
Caroline, don't!
Get off her!
Leave her alone!
Leave her alone!
Stop it!
Stop it!
He's trying to save her life!
Stop it!
Your daughter just jumped off the pier!
Why?
Maybe because she couldn't lie anymore.
Give me your jacket.
I'm sorry I lied.
I didn't mean to get you in so much trouble.
I'm sorry.
I had no idea.
Mitch, you ever just want to get on a boat and sail away?
You know, I should have let you drown.
I wouldn't have to listen to all this nonsense.
Oh, what?
What, are you angry with me?
Huh?
You angry with me?
You mad at me?
Go ahead.
Hit me.
Hit me, go ahead!
Hit me!
No!
'Cause I know you won't hit me back 'cause I'm in this chair.
I'll knock you right on your ass.
What's the matter?
You afraid that when I hit you, you won't be able to use your chair as an excuse anymore?
Go ahead, man...
You think you know everything, don't you?
Don't you?
You say you love the water.
Then why don't you take this job, man?
!
Be a swim coach!
Knock it off!
Knock it off!
Now, shut up and listen to me.
You've got an opportunity to inspire kids.
You can teach them, man.
You can teach them no obstacle is too big to overcome.
You can make a difference in their lives.
Turner, you've got more courage than any man I've ever met.
Will you just use it?
!
You... you could always do this to me, couldn't you, Mitch?
That's because I love you, man.
I love you like a brother.
Hey, Mitch?
Yeah?
I'm starting to feel pretty silly here.
People are looking at us.
Come on, I'll race you to the end of the pier.
Listen, what do you say we grab something to eat?
Go down to the Palisades.
I'd love it.
Let's take a walk on the beach first and watch the sunset.
Perfect.
Yeah.
Can I come up?
Please, just for a minute?
Sure.
I just came to say good-bye.
I'm moving back to Ohio.
I hope you'll be happy there.
Me, too.
Eddie, I can't tell you how sorry I am about what I did to you.
I never meant for it to get so out of hand.
I really didn't.
Good luck in Ohio.
Do you forgive me?
He does.
It's just hard to say.
Well, I can't blame you for hating me.
Well, thanks, you know, for not letting me drown.
Bye.
Caroline.
Look, I know that you... you didn't mean for things to happen the way they did, but you didn't have to do something so stupid just to join a clique.
Hey... nothing's worth killing yourself for.
You understand?
My dad said that I can go see someone...
I guess a psychologist or something.
He'd come with me.
Good.
Well... take care of yourself, all right?
Tell Shauni she's lucky.
She said you were lucky.
I am.
I'm the one that's lucky.
[thunder]
2.4.
2.4.
Right.
Soldering gun.
Gun.
Check.
Final check, Max.
All systems go, Josh.
Enter the program.
Entering program.
I'm switching on, Max.
Right, Josh.
[Switch clicks]
Ok, Max, hit "enter."
You got it, Josh.
[Meow]
[Meow]
I give up.
Would you turn that off?
It just needs a better operating system, Josh.
It needs a better everything.
He's a piece of junk.
No, he isn't.
Let's go, guys.
We're late.
I've got a good feeling about tonight, Josh.
I really do.
Max, you always have a good feeling.
Not always.
Occasionally I have a bad feeling, but tonight I have a good feeling.
Ok, ok, keep walking.
Come on, guys!
Slow down.
I got short legs, remember?
I just want to say one thing to you before we go.
No matter what happens tonight,
I think you guys are the greatest.
Your dad would be real proud of you.
Thanks, mom.
Ok, put your seat belt on.
You ready?
Good evening, and welcome to the 15th annual junior inventor awards.
I'm proud to announce to you today our six semifinalists.
From right here in sherman, the Carson brothers...
Josh and Max.
Hi, Josh!
Celia Barnes,
Matthew marsella,
Mei po wong, and last, our two-time winner...
Dwayne kotzwinkle.
That's my boy.
May I have the envelope, please?
Well.
This is unusual.
Our judges seem to be split between Dwayne kotzwinkle...
And Josh and Max Carson.
Yes!
What?
In cases of a tie, we ask for a demonstration, a sort of play-off.
How about it, boys?
Dwayne's not gonna win it this year.
Every year his dad helps him.
Every year he wins.
That's my boy.
After you've had a hard, long day on the court, sometimes you're too tired to pick up the balls.
[Whooshing]
So with my back-saver here, all you have to do is aim the magic wand.
And presto...
Martini time.
Thank you, Dwayne.
Um, your turn, boys.
Yeah...
Move.
We call this the transporter.
It's a voice-activated garbage-can mover.
We thought elderly people could use it to get their garbage from their homes to the street.
Emily!
Emily, stop!
It also has sonar sensors, so it won't run anyone down.
I think we've got our winner...
Josh and Max Carson.
Yes!
Congratulations, Max.
Thanks.
Boy, $1,000.
What are you going to do with all that money?
Well, Josh wants to give half to mom.
She's sort of broke.
We'll spend the rest on Newman.
Newman?
Yeah.
He's our robot.
Max!
Top secret, huh?
Sorry.
Josh is a little paranoid till we get a patent.
Well, you never can be too careful.
You!
No, no!
Mom, not before breakfast.
What is this?
I can't take half your contest money.
Ok.
Sure, you can.
Great.
This is your money.
Pass the syrup, Max.
Right, Josh.
Ok,
I will borrow half of this, but if you need any of it for your robot...
Newman.
Ignore him.
His name is Newman 'cause he's going to be a new man someday.
Newman?
I like that.
That's cute.
[Telephone rings]
When mom gives us our half, we'll get Newman the best money can buy.
Remember, $500 is not that much.
Guys, I'm showing the house later.
[Humming]
Max.
Max.
I don't want to sell.
I like it here.
Sweetie, I like it, too.
We just can't afford it.
If we sold Newman, we'd make some money.
Then we wouldn't have to sell the house.
Save it, Max.
Give Newman a chance.
With better components, he can really work.
I'm sure he can, sweetie.
It's just that inventing takes such a long time.
Remember how long it would take your dad when he was building a new computer?
You guys are just like him.
I can't get you out of the shop.
Keep eating.
Why do you keep talking about him?
I don't want to hear about him anymore.
It's been two years.
He was your father.
He didn't care about us.
That's not true.
He loved you.
Oh, yeah?
Then how come he killed himself?
Don't worry, mom.
He just needs more time, that's all.
He'll get better.
Josh, wait up.
[Bell rings]
Good morning, class.
Most of you know my assistant for the week,
Josh Carson.
Josh in on loan to us from advanced programming.
He's going to help me explain to you how someday computers may be able to think all on their own.
Isn't that right, Josh?
Uh, yeah.
Josh.
Why don't you take a seat?
You just correct me if I make a mistake.
Some experts predict it will be 10-25 years before computers can take in information...
Ok.
And make decisions on their own.
What's your opinion, Josh?
What?
How long will it be before computers can think?
Well, um, not too much longer.
I think I've almost got it.
What are you going to do with all that money?
Josh thinks we should give half to mom.
She's sort of broke.
We'll spend the rest on Newman.
Newman?
Yeah.
He's our robot.
Max!
How old are these kids?
10 and 15.
Oh, come on, Alice, they're babies.
Mel, I know there's a story here.
I can taste it.
Resistors...
Servos.
Josh, look...
A 320 triax.
Max, we need to get a lot of stuff.
We can't afford to get it all here.
Sure!
We got 500 bucks.
So how was I supposed to know a triax costs 250 bucks?
Yo, guys.
Steve, where the hell have you been?
Hi, honey.
Where's Max?
He's with Steve.
Yo!
I'm ready for the freeway.
Ok, turn, turn, turn.
I got it.
I got it.
Ohh.
Let's do this again tomorrow.
Hey, three-point landing.
Here's your stuff.
Kid's a natural.
The natural is 10 years old.
Hey, Josh.
Max told me about the contest.
Congratulations.
Oh, thanks.
I invited Steve for dinner, ok?
Sure.
It was his idea.
Really.
Hi.
Hi.
When did you get back?
You miss me?
Did you finish your story?
Almost.
Did you miss me with a passion that knows no bounds?
Almost.
So, when are we getting married?
Ahh...
Mmm, I don't know.
Ahem.
You know, you may not believe this, but somewhere deep, deep down inside, he really likes me.
We don't need that much more stuff, do we?
I thought we wanted an articulated appendage, linear actuator, gated servos...
Ok, ok.
We'll have to trade for them.
Well, there's only one person who...
No.
I'm not going to him.
Forget it.
Why did I let you talk me into this?
It'll be fine.
Trust me.
Well, well.
If it isn't the Carson brothers.
What can I do for you, boys?
We have some stuff we want to trade.
Oh, you're mass-producing your garbage transporter, huh?
No.
Something new?
Yeah, it's a rob... ouch!
It's nothing.
Well, I don't think we can let our professional rivalry stand in the way of doing a little business.
Dwayne, get up here!
Aw, dad.
What are they doing here?
Will you just shut up?
They're clients now.
Very nice.
Daddy's?
We need...
Five miniservos, linear actuator 5148...
I think we can do some business.
Get to it, Dwayne.
We're never going there again.
Why not?
I like that iguana.
Yeah, right.
Hey, you think I'm going back?
Not on my life.
Hey!
What?
Be gentle.
Yeah, ok.
Max.
That's it.
Let's program him.
Right.
Ok.
Teach him how to wave.
Wave?
Why does he need to know how to wave?
It's friendly.
Well, let's see if he'll move first.
Got to expect some bugs.
Dad always said, "no bugs, no bytes."
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ok...
Here it goes.
All right!
We have movement.
Teach him how to wave.
Ok, I'll try.
Newman, stop!
It's not responding.
What's he doing?
I don't know.
Stop it!
Newman!
Get him!
Quick!
Josh, get him to stop.
He'll break something.
Newman!
Oh, Newman!
Please!
Newman!
Stop!
Come on!
Uh-oh.
It's that reporter from the contest.
My boss is very excited about this story.
Oh, I think the boys will love the idea.
Josh.
Max?
I don't know.
Yieaah!
Are you sure you're all right?
I'm fine.
Really.
Mom, this very second
Richard Williams is stuffing his face with all the best candy.
He takes Halloween very seriously.
Well, so did I.
I was always the first one there.
So...
Did you finish your robot?
We don't have a robot.
What?
Sorry you came all this way for nothing, miss woods.
Well, don't worry about it, Josh.
Thank you, Mrs. Carson.
I'll see myself out.
See you, Max.
Bye.
What's going on?
Mom, she's a snooper.
She could be a spy for a robotics company.
A spy?
Josh, she's a reporter.
Until we get a patent for Newman, he's off limits, especially to her.
Josh.
Next time, be more polite.
Sorry, mom.
Tomorrow we put in a security system.
Honey.
Try and have a good time, ok?
And give my love to Beth.
¶ Baby ¶ boo!
¶ You're scarin' me ¶
¶ you're my nightmare ¶
¶ my fantasy... ¶
I vant to suck your blood.
Not now, stupid.
¶ Baby ¶
¶ you're scarin' me ¶
¶ you're my nightmare... ¶ are you concentrating, Timmy?
Don't push down so hard.
It will work this time.
Josh.
No, wait.
Come on.
You've got to try this.
Let Josh have a turn.
I was contacting Napoleon.
Later, Timmy.
What is this?
A telephone to heaven.
Put your fingers on here, and open your mind.
Is there anyone you want to contact?
What?
No.
Is there anyone who wants to contact Josh Carson?
You do.
Is there anyone who wants to contact Josh?
Come on, come on.
Come on, come on.
"D."
"A."
"D."
Dad?
Very funny.
Wait, Josh!
I didn't do anything.
I promise.
[Meow]
[Meow]
Mom?
[Crash]
Max?
Hello?
[Meow]
Charlie.
[Purring]
[Meow]
[Sniffing]
Charlie, have you been smoking?
[Meow]
[Meow]
Are you out of your mind breaking into their house?
Mel, I saw something.
A hand doesn't mean squat.
This hand was not human.
It belonged to a robot?
There was this flash of light.
Maybe the robot was taking snapshots.
Mel, please.
I need this one.
Ok, but this time, make sure you get something on tape, all right?
Josh...
I think somebody has a question.
I'm really sorry.
I didn't know about your dad.
I just thought your parents were divorced like everybody else's.
Uh...
It's ok.
Josh, did anything weird happen after you left the party?
Why?
Well, 'cause when I picked up the pointer, it was hot.
Something did happen, didn't it?
The house kind of felt...
Th-there was this smell...
Oh, forget it.
No, tell me.
What smell?
Pipe smoke.
My dad...
Hey, Carson.
How you doing, wimp?
Hey, Beth.
I got tickets...
Get lost, Dwayne.
I don't like to lose, Carson.
Don't you forget it.
Test-testing.
Testing.
All right.
Now to find the real me.
[Low-pitched voice] No, no.
That's not it.
Let me see here...
[High-pitched voice] No.
That's not it, either.
Testing.
[Normal male voice] All right.
Now we're talking.
Are those for one of your inventions?
Yeah.
Could I see it?
Oh, I don't know.
Please.
Your garbage transporter is so cool.
Please?
Max, Lester's on the phone, sweetie.
Ok.
Ok, let's go.
Wait.
I didn't want you to trip the alarm.
Oh, really?
Oh, he's adorable.
He's ok.
I think it's wonderful.
I think you both are.
Well, that's it?
No show?
Uh, s-some other time.
Please, Josh?
Ok.
But don't expect much.
Cool.
God, that's great.
What's this for?
Uh, it tells him how hard to squeeze.
When he grabs something, fibers rustle, and a microphone hears it underneath the finger.
As his grip tightens, the mic tells the hand to stop squeezing.
At least that's what's supposed to happen.
That's so brilliant.
Oh, well...
Well, can he pick this up?
No.
That would take major programming.
Please, just try it for me.
Then I'll go.
I promise.
Oh, ok.
But it's not going to work.
See?
I told you.
[Robot voice] Here, Beth.
After you tighten my screws, could you scratch my back?
I didn't do that.
Honestly.
Yeah, right.
I suppose he did.
What's she doing here?
Max.
Hi, Max.
Beth is borrowing a screwdriver.
Uh, keep it.
We've got plenty.
Thanks, Josh.
See ya.
How did you do it?
What?
Get him to talk.
Talk?
Wait a minute.
I know he picks up things.
Have you been drinking?
This is crazy.
He was doing all sorts of stuff for Beth and me.
[Robot voice] Hi, boys.
[Normal voice] What do you think of my robot voice?
Ok, who's doing this?
I know it's a different look, but the voice?
Dad?
Dad?
Bingo.
Look at you two.
You've grown, and I've shrunk.
Is this amazing?
I can't believe I made it back here.
How'd you get in there, dad?
Josh called me from the Halloween party...
Super-long distance.
What?
I tried getting back, but you know me with directions.
Anyway, I'm here thanks to Beth.
She's cute.
A little pushy, but cute.
I was afraid I'd end up in the TV.
You did, sort of.
We scrapped it for Newman.
Good.
I bet you're reading more.
That was you moving the pointer around?
Well, it wasn't Napoleon, although he did give me some tips.
He loves games.
You know Napoleon?
Yeah.
Napoleon, Einstein.
Your grandma Millie's up there.
She sends hugs and kisses.
What?
Max, I could use a hand in here.
Listen, we'll talk later.
Promise not to tell your mom yet.
You know how she hates surprises.
But, dad...
It's ok, Max.
Go help your mom.
I wish you could eat with us.
Me, too, but my stomach's not what it used to be.
Come on.
Good night, guys.
Night, mom.
Good night.
Ok.
Let's go.
Wait.
She's not even in bed yet.
Do you think dad's cramped inside Newman?
What?
He seems nicer.
Does he seem nicer to you?
Maybe being dead has made him nicer.
Will you stop for a second?
Ah, Sarah.
Max, get back to bed, young man.
Uh-oh.
Ouch.
Remind me to get curb feelers.
Josh, look.
[Newman] I think she saw me.
Let's get him out of here.
What is that?
What?
You know what.
Um...
That?
Newman.
Newman?
Yeah.
I think you scared him.
I scared him?
So this is Newman.
Hello, Newman.
[Robot voice] It's a pleasure to see you, Mrs. Carson.
Really a pleasure.
You look stunning in that robe.
I admit, I thought a robot was ambitious, even for the two of you.
More cocoa, Mrs. Carson?
Thank you.
You're so welcome.
You'll go loco for my cocoa.
He's incredible.
More cocoa, Josh?
I'm surprised he's so sophisticated.
Us, too.
Marshmallows?
Quit showing off.
Cookies?
How did you do it?
Why not go to bed?
It's getting late.
Good idea.
I'm here to serve you.
What else can he do?
Mom, he's still experimental.
¶ I can also sing ¶ when will you know?
He may look finished, but he really isn't.
He still needs testing.
Testing 1-2-3.
We got school tomorrow, huh?
You're right.
I got carried...
This is very exciting.
I agree.
He's so cute.
Thank you.
Newman, get the light.
Isn't anybody going to leave a tip?
[Matthew's voice] A robot's work is never done.
Hey, pepe.
Shoo!
I'm the only one watering around here.
Little squirt.
Ah, at least now I have time to stop and smell the roses.
Make that stop and kill the roses.
You're a wonderful help.
[Robot voice] Thank you.
I can't believe how much you can do.
Your boys are very ingenious.
They certainly are.
Tsk.
I wish Matt could see them.
He was your husband?
Yeah.
May I ask what you are thinking now?
Ahem.
I was thinking I can't believe we're talking like this.
Neither can I.
Did he do special things for you?
Something good, maybe?
Yeah.
He gave a great foot massage.
Hmm.
[Doorbell chimes]
Intruders.
Hi.
I'm back.
I got off on the wrong foot with your boys.
I'd love to try again.
If I could talk to them for a minute...
Miss woods, I don't want to be rude, but the boys really aren't interested.
Josh is having a hard time.
His father died, we're moving...
Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't realize... [beeping]
That's my office.
Could I use your phone?
Just for a second.
There's... there's one in the kitchen if that would...
This will be fine.
Please, don't let me keep you.
Ok.
Hi, Mac, what's up?
Yeah, ok.
I'll be there in 15.
No, I'm out at the Carson house.
I think this is a dead one.
Guess you were right.
But then again, you never know.
Would you like some coffee?
I'll talk to you later.
I've got to run.
Some wife's thrown her husband out of the house...
literally.
Thank you.
Yo, mama.
Over here.
Peekaboo.
Your robot is incredible.
I still can't believe it can talk.
Are you going to sell it?
No.
He's not ready yet.
Well, he sure seemed ready to me.
Josh, you're a genius.
Your robot's going to be on the cover of people magazine.
[Blowing nose]
When jaeger gets here, tell him exactly what you told me.
[Robot voice] Why don't you relax?
I will finish cleaning.
[Humming]
How did you know where that bucket was?
Uh...
Max showed me.
Max?
Max hates to clean.
That's why he showed me.
You see, I'm every kid's dream come true.
Yeah.
Especially my kids.
¶ Dit doo-doo-doo-doo ¶ this is my kind of music.
How about you?
¶ Angel, angel ¶ want to boogie, baby?
Let's get down and get back up again.
¶ Must have pretended ¶
¶ to capture my love ¶ you dance divinely.
You're not so bad yourself.
I don't know where I got these moves, but I'm not giving them back.
You've got my turbos churning.
Watch me burn rubber, baby.
Aah!
Excuse me...
Power surge.
I told you I wasn't interested in a child's robot.
But this is Matthew Carson's kids here.
If he was involved, it could be worth a fortune.
Matthew Carson's been dead for two years.
Or maybe this is your subtle way of asking for more money.
I couldn't do that.
Not to you.
This meeting is over.
See ya.
18 speeds with an acu-shift derailleur.
Yeah.
Hi, Max.
Hi.
Could be yours.
Is this a bribe?
Of course not.
I just wanted to show you what it would be like to be famous.
You could afford anything you wanted, like this bike...
Or a house.
¶ I had a vision ¶
¶ where are you now?
¶
¶ when something's different... ¶ mom?
Hi, honey.
Hey, big guy, how was school?
What is going on?
He's in disguise.
That reporter came back.
Oh, great.
That's ok.
Guess what we're having for dinner.
Beef stew.
Newman suggested it.
I have no idea how he knew it was your favorite.
Robot intuition.
And after dinner?
Entertainment.
[Sarah] Oh, look at you guys.
Oh, that feels wonderful.
The pleasure is all mine.
[Sarah giggles]
Charlie, there you are.
Was that your dad's second or third computer?
Third.
Third.
Or second...
Maybe.
Your husband was quite good-looking for a human.
I'm sure he misses you all very much.
[Josh] Happy now?
[Matthew's voice] What?
Mom's a total wreck 'cause of you.
Why don't you just leave us alone?
I didn't like you when you were alive, and I don't like you now.
Josh, stop it!
You think I feel sorry for you?
You're the one who killed yourself.
[Matthew's voice] Killed myself?
Is that what you thought?
I didn't kill myself.
It was an accident.
Yeah, right.
Look, my car went off the cliff, but I didn't do it on purpose.
I lost control trying to avoid a...
Skunk.
Skunk?
Everybody thought you were so depressed before you...
I was upset, but I had a good reason.
I never told you this, but three days before the accident, someone stole the prototype for the computer I'd been working on.
I wasn't positive who did it, but I had a pretty good idea.
I was going to have it out with the guy when that skunk ran in front of me.
What guy?
Josh, there's nothing we can do about that now.
It's ancient history.
Sorry, dad.
Me, too, Max.
I'm sorry about a lot of things.
I'm sorry I wasn't here for the two of you.
I'm sorry I was such a lousy dad.
You weren't that bad.
Yes, I was, Max.
I never took the time to be a dad.
I didn't realize how little time I was going to have.
You bought me that football helmet, remember?
I still have it.
I didn't buy it, Max.
Your mom did...
Like everything else.
Well...
I'm still glad you came back, dad.
Thanks, son.
I am, too.
So, I guess Al was right, huh, Josh?
Who?
Al Einstein.
Genius.
Bushy hair.
He didn't think it was such a good idea to come back.
But I just wanted to help.
You can, dad!
Help us fix Newman.
What?
With you inside, we might be able to tell what's wrong with him.
Now, that is a great idea, Max.
He's never going to work, even with your help.
That's not true.
Hey, he's almost ready.
Well, I guess if it would make Max happy.
Yes!
All right!
[Sighs]
You must be proud to have built a robot.
Yeah, I guess.
I didn't do it all by myself.
Josh helped, too.
How long did it take to build him?
About seven months.
Wilkinson wants to run it on the morning news as a special.
Great.
It's a secret.
But he's kind of like a computer on wheels.
Great.
[Matthew] Ok, what do you want him to do first?
Uh, get him to talk on his own.
Good luck.
What if you cross e-10 with s-17, bypassing the double poles?
No, no.
That won't work.
He'd stutter.
Let's see...
What if I reroute m-18 from the emitter leg into the collector hole?
Now you're cooking.
[Matthew] Finished?
I think so.
Ok, I'm going to shut up now.
Any corny jokes you hear will be Newman's.
How about if you don't use the keypad?
Use his voice recognition instead.
He's going to do it.
Newman...
Can you hear me?
Yes.
I can hear you.
Yes.
I can hear you.
Yes.
I can he...
Thanks.
I needed that.
[Matthew] Hmm.
No bugs, no bytes.
Ok...
Check his motor reflexes.
Let's see if he can, uh...
Pick up that glass of juice.
Newman...
Do you see the glass on the table?
Yes.
I want you to reach for it.
Ok.
[Matthew] Good...
Good.
Now pick it up.
Good.
Now bring it to me.
Not so good.
Maybe he's left-handed.
Sorry.
[Max] Don't feel bad, Newman.
It's ok.
[Josh] I give up.
[Matthew] Come on.
Don't give up, Josh.
Try it again.
He's not sophisticated enough.
Yes, he is.
I bet that last adjustment you made did the trick.
Come on...
Who among us got an "a" on our first science test, huh?
Newman...
Pick up the glass.
Now what, Josh?
[Matthew] Psst.
Over here.
Surprise.
Did you do that?
You talkin' to me?
Would you like a drink, Josh?
You did it, Josh.
Thanks to you.
No, thanks to you.
He's your invention.
I'm real proud of you, son.
Josh, I don't blame you for being angry with me.
I'm trying to make it up to you.
I missed you so much.
Ahh...
I'm here, Josh.
I'll always be with you.
More juice?
So, Max...
He did it.
Very funny.
Josh is right.
I did it, Max.
Oh, my God!
[Matthew] Max, watch out for the...
Whoa!
Box.
[Anchor] And now for a change of pace, some good news.
Here's Alice woods with a special report.
Every so often, you stumble upon something magical.
I found it here on maple drive.
A little handmade robot that walks, talks, even does the rumba.
You dance divinely.
You're not so bad yourself.
[Matthew] Touchdown.
Take it easy.
Throw it to me now.
I got good hands, considering they're aluminum.
[Matthew] 1...
And 2...
And 3...
This is great.
I love it!
I'm going deep, dad.
Go for it.
Watch this, Max.
All set?
Here comes!
Uh-oh.
It's in here.
Excuse me.
Beth!
What is going on?
[Beth] Newman was on TV.
Oh, my...
How'd he get...
Where are you?
I'm going to kill you!
[Sarah] Josh, what's going on?
[Max] Don't, Josh, please!
She promised me she wouldn't show it till we got a patent!
[Sarah] Josh, stop it!
You ruined everything!
[Matthew] Josh!
Now, that's enough.
Calm down.
It wasn't Max' fault.
[Max] I'm sorry, Josh.
We'll never get a patent in time.
Somebody's going to rip us off like they did you.
No, they're not.
They know what Newman can do, but they don't know how he does it.
Matthew?
Why don't you guys take Beth and go calm down the neighbors?
Go on.
It's ok.
Hello, Sarah.
It is you.
Well, sort of.
I kept thinking that I felt you, but...
I thought if I told the boys they'd think I was losing my mind.
Oh, Sarah.
Josh, is Newman your dad?
Yeah.
So the pipe smoke was...
You brought him back here, Beth.
Yeah.
Thanks, Beth.
Wow!
Wow.
Well, I guess I should go home or something.
Oh, wait, wait.
Beth...
Um...
Don't...
Don't worry, I'm not going to tell anyone he's your dad.
Besides, who'd believe me?
See you at school, Josh.
Bye, Max.
Whoo-hoo-hoo!
[Honk honk] Hey, guys!
I've got some great news.
Sarah!
Steve.
Hi.
Whoa.
What is that?
It's a robot.
Kids do that?
Incredible.
When did you get back?
About 20 minutes ago.
I've got wonderful news.
[Robot voice] Not so fast, buddy.
I like that.
That's good.
Come here.
Did you notice I bought a new sweater?
Come on.
Sit down.
The magazine loved my story.
They gave me a $25,000 advance to turn it into a book!
Do you believe that?
That's great.
Congratulations.
That's not all...
[Steve] Go ahead, open it.
No, Steve.
What do you mean, no?
Come here.
Put it on.
I can't.
I'm married.
I was married...
I am, uh... um...
Sarah...
You're not married.
Excuse me.
Are you all right?
What's going on around here?
It's very complicated.
I don't know that I can explain it.
Try.
I can't.
I'm sorry.
I just need some time to sort things out.
Fine.
I know what I said.
I had no idea this thing was so advanced.
I want the plans.
We'll build our own outer chassis.
Yes.
But I want more money.
You'll get what I deem appropriate.
You forget, Walter, I still have Matthew Carson's prototype with your fingerprints all over it.
[Doorbell rings]
Hello.
I'm sorry I lied to you, Max.
I'm never watching your channel again.
Please, just leave us alone.
I'm sorry.
Nice going, mom.
Please, I want to help you.
I've contacted a robotics company.
They're very interested.
If you'd just let me help you.
[Matthew] Maybe you should talk to her.
Watch out, mom.
She, like, totally mesmerizes you.
She just wants another story.
No.
Mm-mmm.
I don't think so.
Give her another chance.
Mrs. Carson.
Hello.
I'd like to introduce you to Mr. Henry kilbrandt, president of zindath robotics.
And this is Mr. Michael Abbot, his supervising engineer.
The boys are right in here.
Newman.
My, my...
Gentlemen, my name is Henry.
And this is Mike.
We came all the way from Texas just to see this little buddy of yours.
My name is Newman.
Delightful, isn't it, Mike?
Hmph.
[Kilbrandt] I hope it's ok for Mike to examine him.
We've had quite a few people try to sell us phony robots.
[Josh] Newman's no phony.
We'll see.
I'd like a demonstration, please.
Ok.
Would you like a glass of juice, Mr. kilbrandt?
Well...
All right.
[Josh] I'll have Newman serve you.
Just a moment.
Have him pick out this pen instead.
You can't expect a robot...
Excuse me, Mr. kilbrandt, but this robot should be able to do almost anything.
Maybe the only thing it can pick up is a glass.
I suppose you're right.
Josh, can he do it?
I don't think so.
That's a very intricate manipulation.
I see.
Well, that's too bad.
This isn't going to work.
Let's go.
Try it.
Go on.
I don't want you to do it.
I won't.
I promise.
Excuse me?
Uh, he said we can do it.
Go on, Josh.
Go on, honey.
Yeah.
Newman...
I want you to approach Mr. Abbot, the man on the right.
Yes, Josh.
Ready for next command, Josh.
Now raise your arm to Mr. Abbot's pocket.
Which pocket, Josh?
His inside pocket...
With the pens inside.
Now extract the pen.
Yes, Josh.
It's amazing, isn't it, Mike?
Uh...
Just a minute.
I meant this pen, and I'm going to put it in my back pocket.
Mike, please wait in the car.
[Robot voice] Oh, Mike.
You forgot your pen.
Oops.
Ha ha ha ha.
This was a new shirt.
Not anymore.
He has a mind of his own sometimes.
I'm sorry.
We're in business.
I'll draw up the papers, and we'll pick up the prototype when they're signed.
Pick him up?
Oh, yes.
Our designers have to analyze and break him down and modify him.
He's a wonderful handmade robot, but people want high-tech devices.
Then you can't have him.
[Max] Right.
But, boys...
You can have the design, but we keep the prototype.
Right.
But, boys, that's impossible.
Mrs. Carson, could I have a word with you, please?
Uh...
It's not up to me.
Well, if you boys ever change your mind, give me a call.
I'll be in town until Monday.
Ladies.
Bye-bye.
Thank you.
I don't get it, but he must mean an awful lot to you guys.
He does.
Good night, mom.
Good night, Max.
Good night, dad.
Good night, Max.
Boy, it sure feels good to say that again.
Good night, Newman.
Good night, everyone.
Josh, I'm really touched that you want to keep me, but I think you should've made a deal.
Good night, dad.
Hmm...
Good night, Josh.
Coming?
Huh?
Oh, boy!
Curious.
You can say that again.
Curious.
Sarah?
Sarah,
I, uh...
I...
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yi!
Fascinating...
Bingo!
Whoo!
Newman, take it easy.
Hot mama!
Newman, shut down.
Oh, yes, sir.
Sarah...
What are you doing?
Nothing.
[Sigh]
Good night, honey.
I'm sorry, Matt.
I was just being silly.
Do you think you could stay in here with me until I fall asleep?
It's been such a long time.
Ok, sweetheart.
Move it!
What?
Wake up.
[Crash]
[Walter] Would you keep it quiet?
Twit!
Find the plans!
Ouch!
Will you shut up and keep it quiet?
You idiot.
Dad!
Look!
All right!
[Walter] Come on, he ain't that heavy.
Danger!
Improper handling.
Dad, it talked!
Return me at once.
This is unauthorized transportation.
See?
[Matthew] If you return us now,
I'll get them to go easy on you, Walter.
Who is that?
Your worst nightmare.
I knew you were the one who stole my computer for jaeger.
Well, I'll be doggone.
That's the voice of Mr. Carson.
He's back from the grave!
What's going on, dad?
Don't worry about it, boy.
You just shut up.
Uh, look, I'd really...
I'd really like to stand around and chew the fat all day, but as you can see, we're pretty busy back here, so if it's all the same to you,
I'll just say toodle-oo!
Oh, no, you won't!
Ooh!
Don't mess with us!
Dad, are you ok?
Let's get out of here, Newman.
Ok, boss.
Dad, I can't believe he did that.
Adios, amigos!
[Dwayne] Dad, just tell me what to do!
Go get him, will you?
What are you doing?
Where did he go?
[Matthew] You and jaeger are going to jail this time!
You're not going to rip off my boys like you did me.
Matthew Carson?
What are you doing?
Go!
Right.
[Dwayne] Where is that little runt?
Get those scanners working, Newman.
We've got to find a way out of here.
Hmm...
It may be a good time for a little light housework.
Get out of my way!
I'll just borrow this.
Yoo-hoo, cheeseball!
Huh?
Getting warmer.
Gotcha!
We have lift-off!
Have a ride.
Aah!
Aah!
Aah!
I can't watch.
Aah!
Aah!
[Thunk]
Ohh...
[Moaning]
[Walter] You ok, boy?
Dad...
Help me!
Your invention works on tennis balls.
How about a more practical application?
Got to run.
I'll just say toodle-oo.
I'll just say toodle-oo, too.
Dad!
D... aah!
Now what, boss?
Hmm...
What are you doing?
This is no time to lay...
Whoa!
Ok, and...
Got it!
Elevator going up.
Gentlemen, start your engines.
Well, get it!
Uh-oh.
Get it!
Watch this, Newman...
Bombs away!
And they're off!
And it's a left hook to the face.
Another left!
Way to go, boss!
And... hey!
Wait a minute!
Let go!
Let go!
This is my wheel!
No!
Only one driver at a time.
Damn!
[Sarah] This is kidnapping.
You have got to find him!
Him?
You said this was some kind of machine.
Well, it is.
But it's very important that you find him.
Any ideas on who might have taken him?
Are you all right?
Half the state knows about him.
It could've been anyone.
Ok, we'll, uh...
We'll look into it.
Thank you.
We're going to have to find dad ourselves.
Dad?
I'll explain.
[Max] Let's comb the neighborhood.
Maybe we don't have to.
Are you there, Mr. Carson?
Please hear me, Mr. Carson.
Ahem.
This could be your next book.
Please.
Mr. Carson?
No?
Well, then, who is it?
"E"...
"M"...
"C"... 2...
Emc2?
What?
E=mc squared.
E=mc squared!
Don't you see?
It's Einstein!
Einstein?
Einstein.
Dr. Einstein...
Do you know where my father is?
Testing, testing.
1...2... 3.
Uh, Mr. Carson, are you in there, sir?
Stop playing games, Walter.
I want the designs in the patent office today.
And get rid of this stuff.
Where are the police?
I knew they didn't believe me.
Josh, they'll be here.
Josh?
Josh!
Josh!
Oh, no, you don't!
[Max] Aw, mom, he needs me!
[Steve] Josh, wait!
And until the patent clears, please do not contact me.
[Cans rattle]
Oh, no.
Dad?
Sorry, dad.
Oh, how touching.
[Laughing]
You!
[Dwayne] H-hey!
Hey!
Hey, get off me!
Hey...
Dad, help me!
[Josh] You!
Hey!
I wouldn't do that if I were you.
I'll be right back.
Don't you kids move.
Mom, look!
He's getting away!
You got this wrong.
I was just trying to break it up.
I swear.
Yes, mom!
[Siren]
[Meow]
It looks as good as new.
Maybe.
We'll see.
Dad?
Matt...
Are you in there?
I hear you, Mrs. Carson.
Newman.
Hello, Max.
Hi, Newman.
Hi, Josh.
Are you alone?
Yes.
Hey, I've got an idea.
Why don't we rent a camper for a few days, huh?
Get out in the outdoors...
Do some hiking, do some backpacking.
What do you think?
[Matthew's voice] Great.
Ok.
See you then.
Bye-bye.
[Matthew] Hey!
Que pasa, dudes?
Dad!
Where were you?
Squeezed into a microchip.
Oh, Matt.
Hi, Sarah.
Hi.
Hi, Steve.
I'm Matthew Carson...
Well, I, uh, I used to be.
Nice to meet you.
Likewise, Steve.
Likewise, Steve.
Hi, Beth!
Hi.
Matt...
Sarah, I've got to go back.
I just...
Wanted to say goodbye.
I don't want you to go, dad.
You can't go now.
I have to, Max, but everything's going to be ok for all of you.
I promise.
You're going to have a great life.
I love you, dad.
I love you, too, Josh.
I always will...
But you've got to let me go back.
I belong up there now.
Help me get back.
What do you say, Josh?
We got to send him back.
Dr. Einstein...
If you're still out there, please help take Mr. Carson back.
"O"...
"K"...
Ok.
Thanks, Al.
I owe you one.
Take good care of them, Steve.
I will.
And, uh...
Oh, may I recommend an occasional foot massage?
Hmm?
Ok.
Remember, I'll always be with you...
In some form or other.
Bye, dad.
Bye.
So long, guys.
I'll be sure to give grandma Millie your love.
We love you, Matt.
I love you, too.
Ok, Al...
Beam me up.
I'm coming, grandma!
That's it.
[Knock on door]
Boys, Mrs. Carson,
I've just been on the phone with your dad.
He said to come right over.
He did?
[Kilbrandt] Isn't he here?
No.
He just left.
Oh, shucks.
He told me you wanted to reconsider my offer.
What?
Isn't that true?
[Beep beep beep]
Guess dad knows what's best.
Yep.
That's wonderful, but where is he?
I don't know...
But I know he'll be back...
In some form or other.
Right, Newman?
You bet, Josh.

-Yes, sir?
-Hello there.
You're new, aren't you?
Is there someone you wanted to see, sir?
Well...
Yes, there was, as a matter of fact.
I'd rather like a few quick words with my wife.
Paper!
Paper!
-Good morning, sir.
-Good morning.
Have you a suite?
Excuse me.
And how long will we be having the pleasure of your patronage, M. le Comte?
Difficult to say.
I have a business in London of an indefinite nature.
Have you a florist's attached to the hotel?
But of course, monsieur.
Excellent.
Suite 37.
Flossie, darling.
Oh.
What the hell are you doing here, Carrington?
Florence doesn't want to see you.
I'd have thought the letter from the lawyer made that perfectly clear.
Well, I'm sure we both want to spare Flossie the embarrassment of airing all our little family secrets.
Get out of here.
Rupert.
I thought it was your voice.
There's no need for you to talk to him, Florence.
There's no need for you to even see him.
But I want to talk to him, Father.
Just for a moment.
Please.
All right.
One minute.
Then I want him out of this house.
He never liked me.
Good heavens.
I can't imagine why.
Look, Flossie...
This legal separation --
It isn't what you want, is it?
Rupert...
The only reason I wanted to be alone with you was to be absolutely certain I'd got you out of my system.
I have.
Goodbye, Rupert.
Flossie, wait.
Look, all right, if that's what you really want.
But, look, you couldn't, um...
I'm in a spot of difficulty.
You mean money.
Not a penny of it.
You've had a good run for my money, but now it's over.
I think you should help me out, Flossie.
What were they standing at at the close yesterday in Sydney?
Listen, the geologist's report is fine.
Couldn't be better.
Where do the rumors start?
Do you know?
Paris?
Who in Paris?
Look, Tommy, hold the bank off.
When the real report's published, those shares are gonna rocket.
Yeah.
Right.
I say.
Do you remember those shares Sandy Hacket tipped me to buy?
Shares, Hastings?
The Australian Mining Company.
Yellow Creek.
He said they were about to make some spectacular discovery.
Do not tell me, Hastings.
They are down to five shillings.
Three and six, actually.
I thought you didn't study the stock market.
I do not, Hastings.
I study the psychology.
M. Hacket is what we call the congenital optimist.
The only occasion on which we met, he assured me with the utmost certainty that it would not rain that afternoon because he was going to the garden party.
Yes, I remember.
It bucketed down.
A Mr. Gordon Halliday is here to see you, Mr. Poirot.
M. Gordon Halliday.
Show him in, by all means, Miss Lemon.
Is that the Australian Gordon Halliday?
Mais oui.
The self-made millionaire par excellence.
But he's the chairman of Yellow Creek Mines.
Do you think he'd advise me?
Hastings, I forbid you to mention it.
M. Halliday is here to ask for advice, not to give it.
Mr. Poirot.
Very good of you to see me without an appointment.
Not at all, M. Halliday.
Not at all.
How may I be of service to you?
Well, actually, it's a little awkward.
Flowers from M. le Comte again, madam.
Not more of them.
What does he say this time?
"I'm desolated not to have heard from you.
Can it possibly be that I am condemned to take tea alone?
Have pity, my lovely Florence.
Have pity."
He hasn't changed one bit.
Well...
I could do with a bit of cheering up.
Look, Mr. Poirot, money's no object.
I want him got rid of.
Poirot is not in the business of getting rid of people, M. Halliday.
He's not only European, M. Poirot, he's a Frenchman.
And he's not only a Frenchman, he's a wrong un.
You see, it's hard for poor Florence.
Everybody knows she's my only heir.
That scares off all the decent blokes and brings the buzzards flocking.
And this Comte de Rochefour is one of the buzzards.
Yeah.
Knew it as soon as I heard his wings flapping towards us in Paris.
Of course, Florence thought he was the bee's knees.
I had a hell of a job getting her away from him.
I thought I might find her someone more suitable in English society.
The Honorable Rupert Carrington?
Yeah, well, that was out of the frying pan, into the fire with a vengeance.
And now, just as she gets him out of her hair, back out of nowhere comes this so-called count.
Staying at the Adelphi Hotel.
Spending a fortune on roses.
Poirot is not in the business of vetting the potential husbands, M. Halliday.
I cannot help you.
You keep telling me what business you're not in, Mr. Poirot.
Can't you just run your eye over the pipsqueak for me?
You're not a father, Poirot.
You don't know what it's like trying to bring up a daughter all on your own.
No wife to talk it over with.
No one to ask advice.
Very well.
I will run my eye over him for you.
I can tell you where he'll be in half an hour from now.
Unless I'm very pleasantly mistaken,
Florence will be there too.
Will you go to Crufts?
Crufts is about the most exciting thing in London this month.
No.
That is not so.
I was devastated when you left Paris, Florence.
I was utterly destroyed.
Well, I'm sorry about Paris.
-My father --
-Ah.
Your father.
Perhaps he will look at me in a better light this time.
Why?
What's different this time?
I have a job.
I think the First National Bank of Paris will carry weight.
Even with him.
Well, Hastings, what do your instincts tell you about our so-elegant count?
Well, not a lot, really.
Just looks like a typical fro--
Typical Frenchman.
I mean typical Frenchman of his type... of Frenchman.
Quite so.
Quite so.
Typical of his type.
Bearer bonds?
Worth 20,000 of your English pounds.
Now, if the bank can trust me to such an extent, so can your father.
So can you.
Perhaps.
Is this something to do with some financial master stroke?
I will tell you all about it when we meet tomorrow.
Oh, not tomorrow, I'm afraid.
Tomorrow I'm going away for the weekend.
I accepted an invitation months ago.
Florence, how can I possibly be without you for another three days now that we have found each other again?
Well, you can always come and see me off if it'll make you feel better.
I'm catching the 12:14 from Paddington -- the Plymouth Express -- and then changing at Bristol.
Come and wave goodbye to me.
It is only for three days.
Which of the jewels shall I pack, madam?
Oh, I can't decide.
I'll take the jewel case with everything.
Do you think that's wise, Miss Florence?
Florence, now just --
Oh, do you have to wear those?
With this?
Don't be silly, Father.
-Pack these, Jane.
-Do you have to take them all?
Daddy, you really do have to stop worrying about me.
Be a dear.
Help Jane with the cases.
Hmm.
150,000 shares, Comte?
150,000.
The Yellow Creek Mining Corporation.
To be sold when they reach £1.
It's my security.
Porter.
Be careful with that.
It's a heavy one.
The train now standing on platform one is the 12:14 Plymouth Express via Bristol.
The 12:14 Plymouth Express via Bristol will depart from platform one.
Are you sure you wouldn't rather I stayed with you, madam?
Quite sure.
You go and find your own seat.
Are you expecting company, madam?
Of course not.
Why on earth should I be?
Excuse me.
Do you know if that clock is correct?
No idea, I'm afraid, my dear.
Is Poirot in?
I want to see him!
-Right -
- Right this minute.
-Mr.
Halliday!
Really!
Florence has disappeared.
You've got to do something, Poirot.
She just disappeared into thin air.
Now, calm yourself, M. Halliday.
How can I?
!
I knew something like this would happen.
Tell me.
She was going away for the weekend.
Her maid's just called from Bristol station.
They were supposed to change there, only, apparently, Florence stayed on the train.
Said she had some business further on.
Now, did she specify what business?
No, no, she just said that she'd get the first train back to Bristol, and then they'd go on together.
Well, that is not necessarily to worry, my friend.
But that was over three hours ago, Poirot.
There's still no sign of her.
I see.
What really worries me is that when the maid went along to Florence's compartment at Bristol, there was a man in it with her.
Train now arriving on platform one is the 12:14 from Paddington.
This is Plymouth.
Plymouth station.
The train now arriving on platform one is the 12:14 from Paddington.
Going on to Penzance, are you, sir?
Paper!
Paper!
Extra!
Extra!
Body found on train!
Paper!
Paper!
Extra!
Extra!
What's it all for, Poirot?
You're a clever man.
You tell me that.
My dear friend.
I am so very, very sorry.
You find her murderer, Poirot,
I'll make you richer than you ever dreamed.
Halliday, my friend, it is not a question of money.
Believe me, I also shall not rest until the murderer is brought to justice.
Now, it is essential that I speak with the maid at the earliest possible moment.
She's in the breakfast room.
The police are questioning her right this minute.
I tell you, I never saw his face.
That's a bit hard to credit.
Well, she made sure that I didn't.
Mrs. Carrington.
She was standing in the doorway when we got to Bristol with the luggage already out in the corridor.
I just caught a glimpse of him over her shoulder.
He had his back to me.
Well, you must have noticed something.
I told you.
He was tall.
He had on a dark suit.
And I think...
I'm almost positive that his hair was dark too, but that's all I remember.
Hello, Poirot.
Hastings.
I heard you were here.
Nasty business, this.
Oui, d'accord.
A genuine tragedy.
If I may?
Mademoiselle.
Did he seem to you in any way familiar?
No, I don't...
I don't think he did.
Could it have been Mrs. Carrington's husband?
Well, I only saw him once.
I suppose it could have been.
Have you ever met a man who calls himself le Comte de Rochefour?
-No, sir.
-Bien.
Thank you very much, mademoiselle.
So...
After you'd caught a glimpse of this man you might or might not have seen before, then what happened?
I told you.
Mrs. Carrington said she had business on the train and that I was to take the luggage and wait for her.
Mr. Halliday tells me that Mrs. Carrington had a lot of jewelry with her in a blue morocco traveling case.
That wasn't with the stuff you took off the train?
Oh, no, sir.
She kept that with her.
What do you think, Poirot?
I presume that the traveling case of blue morocco was not discovered with the body.
You presume 100% correct.
Mind you, that doesn't necessarily signify.
For whatever reason the murderer had for killing her, he'd be a fool to let a bag full of valuable jewelry go begging.
Or perhaps he took it to distract us from his real motive.
Taxi!
How long had she been dead when the body was discovered at Plymouth?
About three hours, the doctor says.
After Bristol, the train stops at Weston, then not again until Taunton.
According to the pathologist, she was killed soon after the train left Weston, at the very latest.
Possibly before.
Before the train reached Weston even?
Could be.
The train for Plymouth departs from Paddington station at 14 minutes past 12:00, does it not?
12:14, yes.
Hastings, what do you say to an invigorating ride into the West Country?
Weston station.
Dead on time.
Exactly 25 past 3:00.
Excellent.
And exactly 35 minutes after leaving Bristol, at which time yesterday
Mme. Carrington was alive and well.
The question is, Hastings, was Mme. Carrington still alive and well at this moment?
And if she was alive and well, did she remain in the carriage or did she descend from the train onto the platform,
perhaps to stretch the legs, take in the fresh air?
And did anybody see her doing it?
Précisément.
-Perhaps we should ask a porter.
-Papers!
Yes, we could.
Or...
Or possibly, Hastings...
Papers!
Papers!
Get your papers here!
Papers!
Excuse me.
No, no, no, no.
No.
No, thank you.
You have the appearance of a bright, observant young lad.
That's what my mum says.
Tell me.
I want you to try to remember, at precisely this time yesterday, did you see descending from the train a woman?
A handsome young woman in a blue -- a blue hat and coat, perhaps?
She bought a newspaper off you, huh?
-You mean the Australian lady.
-So you remember her?
I couldn't forget her, gov.
Not with all the fuss she was making.
-Fuss?
-Yeah.
She kept going on about wanting a late edition of the paper.
Any paper.
Well, I told her I only had the early edition, but she wouldn't believe me.
Kept going on, saying, "I must have one,"
as though her life were at stake.
I see -
- Pardon.
-And, uh...
-Come, children.
Did she give to you any reason why she was so desperate to acquire this late edition?
No, she just kept saying, "He'll be so angry,"
and looking back at the train like someone was on it waiting for her.
-And then?
-Well, nothing.
She just kept going on and on until she nearly missed her train.
She only just managed to jump back on it as it was moving.
Thank you very much.
Early edition, late edition, early edition, late edition.
Superbe, Miss Lemon.
I knew that you could arrange it.
Difficulties are made to be overcome, Mr. Poirot.
"Difficulties are made to be overcome."
What a truly magnificent attitude.
So, Hastings, let us divide these between us
and examine them minutely.
Inspector Japp.
-Chief Inspector.
-Poirot.
Hello.
What's this?
You looking for a job?
No, I know.
You've had a chat with that newsboy.
You think there's something in it?
That is what we are trying to discover, Chief Inspector.
Hmm.
Well, I just thought I'd come and tell you, you could be on the right track with that French gent.
Apparently, he left the Adelphi at 11:00 yesterday morning, an hour before the express left Paddington, and didn't get back till gone 10:00 in the evening.
And nobody has any idea where he spent the day.
However, we picked him up trying to catch the boat train this morning.
We just stopped him for questioning, and he made a run for it.
He's down at the station now.
These papers have probably got nothing to do with it.
Oh, no, no, no, Chief Inspector.
When we shall discover why Mme. Carrington was so anxious to acquire a late edition then we shall know why she was killed and who is responsible.
Another one.
I don't think I can, Mr. Carrington.
I'm sorry.
What do you mean, don't think you can?
Well, for one thing, sir, I think you've had enough.
And for another, there is the question of your bill.
-Who are you?
-Arthur Hastings.
You know this fellow won't give me a drink, Arthur Hastings.
Really?
Well, perhaps I'll have more luck.
Two large Scotches, please.
Had a bit of luck at Ascot yesterday.
Don't talk to me about Ascot.
Horses.
What were you on in the 3:30?
I bet you were on Highland Laddie.
Yes, I was, as a matter of fact.
I hate people like you.
33 to 1.
I put my shirt on Rising Star.
Rising Star.
Every penny I had in the world on that nag.
My last chance.
Must have given you a nasty shock when you read the result in the paper.
Shock?
Do you know why I'm here?
This is the only place I know where my bookmaker can't get at me.
I mean, I don't want to sit here drinking.
I actually dislike drink.
Do you know that?
Why did you back Highland Laddie?
Oh, I had a tip.
I really dislike people who get tips.
Thank you.
You're a good chap, though.
You've got to be fair.
How did you know I read about it in the paper?
Oh, you said.
You said you weren't at the course.
Did I say that?
You are a good chap.
Every penny I had.
I looked at that newspaper.
I could be a success, you know, if I just had the capital.
And tips.
Isn't there anyone you could go to for capital?
Not a soul in the world.
Not now.
I don't want to talk about that.
I demand to see the French consul.
All in good time, M. le Comte.
This is a serious business.
I know nothing of the death of Mrs. Carrington, I tell you.
I am devastated by it.
I'm rather more interested in these things for the moment.
Mr. Halliday is here, sir.
-Show him in.
-Very good, sir.
Mr. Halliday.
M. Halliday, I am devastated for you.
Now, the count says he last saw your daughter when he had tea with her at the Adelphi on Wednesday.
Yeah, he did have tea with her.
One interesting thing, though, Mr. Halliday, is that he had these with him.
Bearer bonds.
And what the count can't tell us, you see, is what sort of financial dealings would require him to bring £20,000 worth of these bonds into England and then take them back again to Paris three days later.
Well, he was obviously using them as security.
Security for what?
That is my bank's business.
Not according to them, it isn't, sir.
I rang them up, you see?
They're quite anxious to have a word with you.
What, uh -- What bank are we talking about?
The International Bank of Paris.
Wait a minute.
I know what he wanted the security for.
10 days ago, somebody started a rumor that a geologist's report on one of my mines was gonna be unfavorable.
The shares plummeted.
You must have made a real killing.
He'd have bought the shares at about three shillings and sold them the day after the real report came out and they went back up again to about 20.
Making about £100,000.
This sounds like something for the fraud department.
Fraud?
What fraud?
It's normal business practice.
No wonder you were so anxious to get hold of a late edition.
He went down to Ascot, put everything he had on Rising Star.
As soon as he knew the horse had lost, he asked Florence for a loan.
She refused him.
Right, Poirot, the frog's cracked.
I knew it.
What he was reckoning was he'd use Mrs. Carrington as a backup in case his deal went wrong.
No, no, no.
He lost every penny he had at the races.
-Races?
Who had?
What races?
-Rupert Carrington.
No, no, it's got nothing to do with Carrington.
Please, please, please, my friends.
If you please.
How can I possibly arbitrate between your two ingenious theories if I can hardly distinguish one word of them?
Now, Chief Inspector, your theory, as I understand it, is that the Comte de Rochefour intended to use Mme. Carrington as a fall back on.
If the takeover deal went wrong, he would then demand of her the money in order to redeem the bonds.
He's admitted as much.
But the deal, it did not go wrong, did it?
So why should the count kill for the jewels of Mme. Carrington?
Whereas, Hastings, your theory is that when M. Carrington discovered that his certain winner fell at the last fence, he then demanded from his wife the money in order to remove the threat of the bookmakers.
And when she refused, he killed her for her jewelry.
Exactly.
Then you tell me, Hastings, why does M. Carrington still lurk about his club, drinking himself into oblivion and shaking with fear of what they might do to him, these very same bookmakers?
Bon.
These feverish speculations, they will not do.
Order and method will be our guides.
Now, I have been consulting the admirable files of Miss Lemon.
So, Chief Inspector, get four of your best men and meet us at this address at 9:00.
Find the jewels, and you'll find the killer.
What's happening?
Nothing.
He's knocking at the door.
Hold on.
Someone's answered.
He's gone in.
I wish I knew what he was up to.
I'm not quite clear what this is about, Mister...
A friend advised me to get in touch with you.
Friend?
What friend?
He prefers to remain anonymous.
Oh, yes.
I don't think I care for anonymous friends.
My friend is anxious to buy some jewelry.
Plenty of shops around.
You look like a jeweler.
You're very acute, monsieur.
Very well.
Perhaps you read of the jewelry robbery the day before yesterday on the Plymouth Express?
I don't read that sort of trash.
You are very wise, monsieur.
There is blood on those jewels.
It will make them very hard to sell.
You're a funny little fellow, aren't you?
What are you?
Montenegrin?
Polish?
Belgian, M. McKenzie.
You see, those jewels will have to be broken up, removed from their setting.
And whoever tries to sell them will be lucky to receive one-sixth of their true value.
I don't know what your game is, monsieur.
I really don't.
My friend is a truly private collector.
He would not be so fussy.
He would not care if the jewelry were left in its original condition.
In fact, he would prefer it.
Let's hope it stays fine for him.
You got the wrong shop.
None of this means anything to me.
I see.
Sorry I couldn't be of any help.
We all have false hopes, M. McKenzie.
How'd it go, Poirot?
It is him.
He denies all knowledge, of course.
But there is on the coat rack a duplicate of the coat Mme. Carrington was wearing at the time of her death.
Why did he need a duplicate?
For his accomplice to wear, Hastings.
I didn't know he had an accomplice.
But of course he did.
That is how I was able to locate him.
Right.
Come on, lads.
This is the police!
Open this door!
All right.
Break the door down.
Mr. Halliday's dining.
I want a word with you, Mr. Halliday.
You weren't welcome when my daughter was alive.
You're even less welcome now.
I don't care if I'm welcome or not.
Why should you have an easy conscience?
This horror would never have happened if you hadn't come between Flossie and me.
The only thing that came between you and Florence was your character.
She saw you for what you were.
No, she saw what you wanted her to see.
You could never let her go, could you?
Yeah, what is it, Mason?
It's the inspector from Scotland Yard, sir.
And a lot of other people.
Do we have to talk about this?
I am afraid that we do, M. Halliday.
Does no good.
Okay.
Go on.
I still don't understand the business about the newspapers.
Neither did I at first, my friend.
Why should Florence be so desperate to procure this newspaper?
Please, mademoiselle, allow me.
Perhaps her companion was a man who was desperate to know the results of a particular race.
Thank you, mademoiselle.
Or perhaps her companion was a man who desperately needed to know the close-of-day figures on the stock market.
Absurd.
I tormented my brain.
I agitated the little gray cells without mercy.
Why did Florence Carrington so desperately want that newspaper?
And what was the answer?
The answer.
The answer, my friend, was that she did not.
Now, once this idea presented itself to me, the truth, it soon became very clear.
You see, I knew Florence was murdered because of her jewels, but I also knew something about the man who killed her.
Knew what?
The man I was looking for had to be a thief of the most steelhearted, one capable of committing the senseless murder of an innocent young woman.
So I looked in the files of Miss Lemon, and what do I find?
I find a jewel thief by the name of McKenzie.
A plan is devised which will suggest that the theft of the jewels are not the principal cause of the crime that is to take place.
That color really suits you.
Florence Carrington is traveling with the jewels alone and unprotected on the Plymouth Express.
M. McKenzie has also boarded the train at Paddington.
Just as the train reaches Bristol station, he advances towards her carriage.
Aah!
Oh!
The train arrives at Bristol.
M. McKenzie descends from the train carrying with him not only the jewels but also the baggage of Mme. Carrington.
Now, if anybody had looked at the carriage as the train left Bristol station, they would have noticed Mme. Carrington alive and well.
Indeed, at Weston she apparently descended from the train onto the platform, where she made a great fuss about acquiring the late edition.
But this was to ensure that the newspaper boy would remember her.
Hang on a minute.
The pathologist said she was dead before the train reached Weston.
Maybe even before Bristol.
Précisément, mon ami.
So how is this possible?
Do we believe in ghosts?
No.
No, we do not.
It was not poor Mlle. Florence who was seen traveling on the train to Weston.
It was not Mlle. Florence who made at Weston station the fracas.
It was the accomplice of M. McKenzie, wearing the duplicate blue coat.
To kill a fellow human being is vile, my friends.
But I wonder if to kill a fellow human being with a knife is not the most vile.
You look a proper lady.
To see the eyes of the victim staring into yours, to feel the breath upon her face, the scrape of the knifepoint between her ribs.
You see, the ruthless accomplice of M. McKenzie was a woman called Grace Kidd,
who was employed by Mme. Carrington under the name of Jane Mason.
Tell me, mademoiselle, was it absolutely necessary for a poor, wretched woman -- who had never done to you one moment's harm -- to die?
Was there no other way?
Oh, my God!
Those jewels would have set us up for the rest of our lives.
Why take chances?
Right.
That'll be enough of that.
Take her away, lads.
Poor Florence.
Poor, dear Florence.
We found the jewel case in McKenzie's house, Mr. Halliday.
They're not mine.
I know the contents of my daughter's will.
They belong to that creature there.
No.
No, I don't want them.
I'm not going to profit by Flossie's death.
Most sad.
Most sad.
I shall go now, I think.
Oh, you think so, do you?
You may not be a murderer, M. le Comte, but you're still a swindler.
You're coming back to Scotland Yard.
Dear Mr. Poirot,
I would like to express my gratitude for your help in this tragic business.
Your logical and businesslike approach was something I could cling to in the depths of my despair.
I hope sometime in the future to be able to find a measure of such quiet strength.
Then, perhaps, I can start again.
I'm returning home to the memory of happier times.
Old friends may help me live with the past.
Poor M. Halliday.
He says in his letter that he will return to Australia, immerse himself in his work, and try to forget.
He has been most excessive in his generosity.
Poor man.
The EXPRESS OF PLYMOUTH
- Yes?
- Very good afternoon.
Are you new here, is not you?
Does it want to speak with someone, gentleman?
Good ... by chance I want, yes.
It would like giving a chat to my woman.
Newspaper!
Newspaper!
Newspaper!
- Good morning, gentleman.
- Good morning.
Does it have any available suite?
As how much time will we have the honor of his visit, Mr. does It read Comte?
I still do not know.
I have business to negotiate in London for indeterminate time.
- Is there some florist in the hotel?
- Certainly, gentleman.
Excellent.
Suite 37.
Darling Flossie...
Which ray does it do here, Carrington?
Florence does not want to see it.
I thought that the letter of his lawyer it had been quite explicit.
Certainly we want both to avoid some embarrassment to the Flossie with the spread of some secrets of family...
Disappear from here!
Your voice seemed to hear me, Rupert...
There is no need of speaking with him, Florence.
Not so little there is need of receiving.
But I want to speak with him, father.
Only for a little time, please.
It is well.
A minute.
Then I want it out of this house.
- He never liked me.
- Do not say to me!
I do not manage to imagine why...
Listening, Flossie...
as for our divorce it is really that that you want?
Rupert only I agreed in speaking with you alone, to make sure of what I already feel nothing for you.
And it is the case.
- Goodbye, Rupert.
- Wait, Flossie...
It is well, one is what you want.
But it will be that you could...
- I am with some problems.
- Do you want money?
Not even a cash.
You already used yourself the sufficient thing of my money, but that finished.
I find better you help me, Flossie.
What the situation was to the fastening of yesterday, in Sydney?
The report of the geologist is the best, it could not be better.
But where these rumours appeared?
In Paris?
But who, in Paris?
He sees if you stand the bank, Tommy.
When the true report it will be published, the actions are going to fire.
Yes.
It is well.
You remind of yourself of the actions that the Hacket did he advise me to buy?
Which actions, Hastings?
Of that mining Australian group.
Yellow Creek.
He said that they were ready doing a fabulous discovery.
Do not say to me, Hastings:
they are to five shillings.
3.6, to be right.
I thought that you were not interested for the Stock Exchange.
And not, Hastings.
I study psychology.
Monsieur Hacket is what one calls a congenital optimist.
In the only time that we passed by each other, it guaranteed me with all the certainty what in this afternoon would not rain since it was going to a party in the open air.
Yes, I remember.
It rained cats and dogs.
A Mr is here.
Gordon Halliday to see it, Mr. Poirot.
"Monsieur" Gordon Halliday?
- Tell it to enter, Beauty queen Lemon.
- The Australian Gordon Halliday?
The millionaire what was done by own you.
He is a president of the Yellow Creek Mines "!
Do you find what it will be able to advise to me?
You are prohibited to speak in the subject.
The Monsieur Halliday it is here to be advised and not to advise.
Mr. Poirot.
It is a great sympathy to receive me without marking.
Of all, of all.
In what I him can be a usefulness?
It is a somewhat delicate subject...
You.
It reads Comte it ordered him flowers again, my lady.
Again?
What says the card?
I am completely distressed without his news.
It will be possible what I am condemned going to drink alone tea?
Have piety, beautiful Florence.
Have piety.
He did not change anything.
Good ...
I was making distracting well.
The money is not a problem, Mr. Poirot.
I want to be free of him.
The Poirot does not treat this type of subjects, Mr. Halliday.
He not only is European, Sr. Poirot, since he is a French.
And not only he is a French, like swindler.
It is very difficult for Florence.
They all know that she is my heiress.
That frightens the decent types and it attracts the self-seeking ones.
And this such a Comte de Rochefour is he one of these self-seeking ones?
He knew it so that I saw it in Paris, smelling of our turn.
Clear that Florence found it the maximum.
I was worried to get rid of him.
I found what perhaps should know someone in the high English society.
Like Honorary Rupert Carrington?
Yes.
It was a worse the correction than the sonnet.
And now that she was free of him, this supposed Count appears put up in the hotel Adelphi and spending a fortune in roses.
The Poirot has not for custom potential husbands veto,
Monsieur Halliday.
I am not going to be able to help it.
Only he has been saying to me what it does not do, Mr. Poirot.
It will be that it cannot give a peep to this aldrabão, for me?
The man is not a father, Poirot.
It does not do idea of the difficult thing that is to raise a daughter alone, without a wife to accompany me, nobody whom asking for advices...
Very well.
I give him a peep for you.
I can tell him where he will be from here the half hour.
Unless I am wrong very much, Florence will be there also.
Does not it go to the Crufts?
It must be the event more exciting of this month, in London.
That is not true.
I was devastated when it left Paris, Florence.
I was completely finished.
Immense lament that one of Paris.
My father...
His father!
Perhaps this time he sees me with other eyes.
- Why?
What changed?
- I have a job.
Dressing what the First National Bank of Paris have some weight even before his father.
And then, Hastings?
What he says to him his instinct on the count?
Very little, to say the truth.
And a "franciú" típ a typical French.
I want to say, he is a typical French of his type of French.
There that is true...
typical of his type.
- Actions to a bearer?
- In the value for 20 thousand pounds of yours.
If the bank it trusts me to this point, his father also can trust.
And you also.
Perhaps.
This has something to do with some financial master-stroke?
- Tomorrow I tell everything to him.
- Lament, but tomorrow, no.
I am going to pass on weekend it had been.
There are months that I accepted the invitation.
Since I can pass three distant days of you, now that did we meet ourselves again?
It can be going to say goodbye to me, if that makes it be felt better.
I am going to catch the train of the 12.14 H in Paddington.
The Express of Plymouth, with change in Bristol.
Come to be dismissed of me.
They are only three days.
Which jewels must I pack, my lady?
I do not manage to make up my mind.
I take the box with all.
Does it find sensibly, Beauty queen Florence?
Florence, I find what...
Do you have to use even that?
With this dress?
Do not be stupid, a father.
- It puts these, Jane in order.
- Do you have to take even all?
You did not have to worry so much about me, papa.
Be a darling and it helps Jane to take the suitcases.
150 thousand actions, Comte?
150 thousand.
The Yellow Creek Mining Corporation.
To be sold when they are to a pound.
She is my security.
Be careful with that.
They are weighed.
The train parked in the platform 1 he is the Express of the 12. 14 H de Plymouth road Bristol.
The Express of the 12. 14 H de Plymouth road Bristol 1 will leave from the platform.
He is sure what he does not want that it keeps you?
I have, yes.
It can be going to look for a place.
It is waiting for company, my lady?
Clear what not.
Because it would be?
Want to excuse...
does he know if that clock is certain?
I do not do the least idea.
Is the Poirot?
I want to see it immediately.
In this instant.
Florence disappeared!
It will do something, Poirot.
Simply it disappeared.
- One abates, Monsieur Halliday.
- How I can?
!
I knew that something so it would happen!
She had been going to pass on weekend it had been.
The servant tied me of Bristol.
They must have changed of train, but Florence stayed in the train, he said that it had things to negotiate.
- Did it specify which things would be?
- No, no.
Only he said that he would return in the first train for Bristol and what then would be still joined.
It is not a reason for preoccupation...
But that was that there are three hours and there is still no her sign.
I am seeing...
What more preoccupies me is what when the servant entered in the carriage in Bristol, he saw a man with her.
The train that is submitting in the platform 1, it is it of the 12. 14 H, coming from Paddington.
This is the station of Plymouth.
The train that is submitting in the platform 1, it is it of the 12. 14 H, coming from Paddington.
Newspaper!
Extra!
Extra!
Because these things happen, Poirot?
You are an intelligent man, answer me.
My expensive friend ... immense lament.
Discover the murderer, Poirot and I will do from you a very rich man.
Halliday, my friend, it is not a question of money.
Believe that I also will not rest while it will not take the murderer to the justice.
But it is essential what speaks it more quickly possible with the servant.
It is in the room of meals.
The police officer is now questioning it.
He said already to him:
I did not come seeing the face.
It costs to me believing in that...
She made sure of that itself...
you.
Carrington.
When we brought the Bristol near, she was already at the door, with the luggage in the corridor.
Only I saw it of glance, for top of her shoulder.
He was of back.
It must to me have repaired them in some thing.
He said already to him: it was high, it was wearing a dark suit and I find what I am almost sure what had dark hair, but I do not remember of more at all.
Good afternoon, Poirot.
Hastings.
They told me that it was here.
This was completely very unpleasant.
An authentic tragedy.
One allows me, Mamselle did he seem to him known?
No ...
I cannot say what yes.
It might be the husband of the Mrs. Carrington?
Only I saw it once ... but perhaps work hard.
Already sometime he saw a man who gives for the name of Comte de Rochefour?
No, man.
Very much thank you, Mamselle.
And after having seen of glance this man who has, perhaps yes or perhaps not, I put on previously, what happened?
- He said already to him.
You.
Carrington said what it had subjects to negotiate in the train and in order that I leave with the luggage and to hope for her.
You.
Halliday said to me what you.
Carrington it was taking with her a travel suitcase blue, with immense jewels.
Also did it take this suitcase?
No, man.
That kept her.
What it finds, Poirot?
I calculate that the suitcase of blue travel was not it found next to the body?
And it makes calculations very well.
But that is not necessarily significant.
Whichever the motive was of the murderer, it would be crazy not to get a beating a suitcase full of valuable jewels.
Perhaps it was taking it to distract us of the true motive.
There is how much time was killed, when it was found in Plymouth?
According to the doctor, to around three hours.
After Bristol, the train stops in Weston and only it stops again in Taunton.
According to the pathologist, she was murdered somewhat then of the train to have left Weston, or even even before.
- Before bringing the Weston near?
- And possible.
The train of Plymouth goes out from the station of Paddington ás 12.14 H, is not it so?
Yes, ás 12.14 H.
What you say to me to a realive walk for the field, Hastings?
Estacão of Weston.
And to the marked hour.
There are exactamente 15.25 H.
Excellent.
And exactamente 35 minutes after to go out from Bristol this hour in what yesterday, the Lady Carrington it was still meeting with life.
The question is, Hastings she will be the Lady Carrington was it still alive in this stopping?
And if it was lively, it will be that it remained in the carriage, or it will have gone down even to the platform,
perhaps to stretch the legs, to catch a little air...
And will there be anybody who has seen it?
- We could ask a signalman.
- Yes, we could.
Or perhaps, Hastings...
Newspapers!
Buy here your newspapers!
Excuse ... no, thank you.
It seems to you to be an observant young person.
My mother says that yes.
One remembers of yesterday, exactamente to this hour, to have seen to go down of the train a pretty young person put on as coat and hat blue...
Perhaps he has bought a newspaper...
- The Australian lady?
- One remembers, so?
How could it her forget, chief?
It did an enormous outcry.
- An outcry?
- Yes he wanted by force the last print run of a newspaper.
He told him that it only had print runs you awake early, it did not believe them to me, it was always saying:
I need a newspaper!
, like if the life was depending on that.
It let to him some reason to want desperately the last print run?
No, only he was saying:
He is going to grow so angry!
it was looking at the train, since they were waiting for her.
- And then?
- Not at all, it gorged itself of bursting up to almost losing the train.
It jumped for the train practically in movement.
Very much thank you.
Morning print run, last print run.
Morning print run, last print run.
Fantastic, Beauty queen Lemon.
I knew what I would get.
The difficulties were done to be exceeded, Mr. Poirot.
The difficulties were done to be exceeded what praiseworthy attitude.
Very well, Hastings let's divide this between us and let's examine them thoroughly...
The Inspector Japp.
- Inspector-chief...
- Poirot.
What we have here?
Does it walk to the search of job?
No, I know that it talked with the news-dealer.
Does it think that there can be there something?
It is that that we are trying to discover, Inspector-chief.
I found that he better will see him saying what must be in the certain way as for that French man.
Apparently it left the Adelphi ás 11.00 H of yesterday, an hour before of the Express to go out from Paddington and he did not return even after the 22.00 H.
And nobody knows where it passed the day.
We caught it this morning, trying to catch the train.
We boarded it to be questioned and it tried to escape.
It is at this moment in the squad.
These newspapers have nothing to do.
No, not, Inspector-chief.
When we will know because the fact is that the Lady Carrington it was so anxious because of buying the last print run, we will discover the motive by which it was murdered and the one who was the person in charge.
- More one.
- Lament, but not, Mr. Carrington.
- What it means, " do not prune "?
- Because it already drank the sufficient thing and there is still the question of the count...
- Who is you?
- Arthur Hastings.
This type does not want to give me a drink, Arthur Hastings.
To serious?
Perhaps I have more luck.
Two uísques doubles, please.
- Yesterday I escaped well in Ascot.
- Do not talk to me about Ascot.
Horses!
In which did it bet on that of the 15.30 H?
- Apposition that was in the "Highland Laddie"!
- Yes, by chance even it was.
I hate people like you. 33 to one.
I bet everything on the "Rising Star".
" Rising Star "!
All my money in that jade!
To mine last opportunity.
It is necessary to have been a shock when it read the result in the newspaper.
A shock?
Does he know because I am here?
It is the only siege where my broker does not catch me.
I do not want to be here drinking.
Does he know that I do not even like drinking?
- Because it bet on the "Highland Laddie"?
- They gave me a hint.
I hate persons who receive hints.
Thank you.
I me them will be just, you are a good person.
- How he knows that I read in the newspaper?
- He said that it was not in the racecourse.
Did I say that?
You are an even good person.
All my money!
When I looked at the newspaper...
I could be well an event, the capital had been.
And the hints.
There is nobody to whom could it resort for capital?
Not even the only person.
Now already not.
I prefer not to speak on that.
- I demand to see the French consul.
- Completely at his time, Mr. It reads Comte.
This is a very serious subject.
He already told him that I know nothing on the death of the Mrs. Carrington.
- I am distressed by the piece of news.
- I am more interested in this.
- You.
Halliday arrived already.
- Tell it to enter.
Mr. Halliday.
Monsieur Halliday, my deep feelings.
The count says what his daughter saw for the last time when they took tea in Wednesday.
Yes, they took tea joined.
The most interesting thing, Mr. Halliday, the fact is that it was bringing this with him.
Actions to a bearer.
But the count does not want to say us which business type makes be brought by it 20 thousand pounds, to take them of turn for Paris, three days later...
It is obvious what was using them like a sort of security.
- Security why?
- This is a subject of my bank.
I do not second them to myself they, gentleman.
I phoned they.
They are anxious to speak with you.
- Which bank does one treat?
- The International Bank of Paris.
Wait there!
I know already for what the security guard wanted.
There are ten days, the rumour was launched what a geological report on one of my mines it would be unfavorable.
The actions fell dizzily.
He must have done a fortune.
He must have bought them to 3 shillings and sold in the following day to the true report to be published, when they rose for 20.
Doing a profit of around 100 thousand pounds.
It seems to me a subject for the department of fraud.
Fraud?
Which fraud?
They are business practices perfectly normal.
It does not admire what was so anxious for the last print run.
LAST HOUR:
RECUPERATION OF YELLOW CREEK
He was up to Ascot and it bet everything what had in the "Rising Star".
So what he knew what the horse had lost, it asked for a loan Florence.
She refused and...
Good, the franciú gave to the gullet.
I knew.
He wanted to use you.
Carrington like reserve, if the plan failed...
- No!
It had lost in the races...
- Run?
Which races?
Rupert Carrington. " Rising Star ".
It has not to do with the Carrington.
Please, my friends!
Since I can choose between both theories, if I hardly realize a word?
His theory, Inspector-chief, such as I understood it, the fact is that the Comte de Rochefour it was intending to use the Lady Carrington as reserve.
If the business was running badly, money would borrow from him, so to recover the actions.
- He already admitted it.
- But the business did not run badly.
Because it would kill the Comte to obtain the jewels of the Lady Carrington?
On the other side, Hastings, your theory defends what when Monsieur Carrington it discovered what the horse had lost, it demanded the money to the woman, to put an end to the brokers and what when she refused, did it kill it to keep the jewels?
Exactamente!
Then it explains me, Hastings, because it will be that the Monsieur Carrington is still put in the bar, drinking up to any more not being able and shuddering of fear of what could the brokers do to him?
These speculations of nothing serve.
Order and method will be our guides.
I have been consulting the incredible filing cabinets of the Beauty queen Lemon.
So, Inspector-chief, choice four of his best men and they meet me to this residence, ás 21.00 H.
Discover the jewels and it will discover the murderer.
- What is happening?
- It swims.
It is knocking at the door.
Wait, someone answered.
He entered.
Who had given me knowledge what walks he conspiring.
I did not realize very well to what it comes, Sr...?
A friend he advised me to speak with you.
A friend?
That I make friends?
- He prefers to maintain the anonymity.
- Yes?
I do not like a great deal of anonymous friends.
My friend is anxious because of buying pieces of jewelry store.
There are thereabouts immense shops.
- You have face of jeweller.
- And very observant, gallant.
So well.
Perhaps have read something on the theft of the day before yesterday in the Express of Plymouth?
- I do not read this filth.
- And it does very well, Monsieur.
These jewels made gushing blood.
They will be very difficult to sell.
You are a character somewhat strange.
Of where it comes?
Is it montenegrino?
Pole?
I am a Belgian, Monsieur MacKenzie.
These jewels will be broken, pulls of the frames.
Who will try to sell them, with great luck only it will get a sixth one of his value.
I do not know which his move, " monsieur.
Really I do not know.
My friend is a true one particular collector, it would not be strange at all.
It would not be preoccupied if the jewels they were in his original form.
In fact, he would prefer.
Let's wait then what is lucky.
It was deceived in the shop.
Nothing from that does sense for me.
I am seeing.
I lament not to have when he could be helped.
All of we have false hopes, Mr. MacKenzie.
- How it ran?
- It is he.
It denies any knowledge, but in the hanger a coat is equal to what you.
Carrington it was using in the height of his death.
- Why would he like an equal?
- For his accomplice, Hastings.
- He did not know that it had an accomplice.
- But it is obvious that yes.
- It was therefore that I located it.
- We go to this, boys.
Open the door, she is the police officer!
Knock the door down.
I want to give him a chat, Mr. Halliday.
It was not welcome when my daughter was alive.
Now it is still less.
That does not interest me.
Because there is of to be of calm conscience?
This tragedy would never have happened if it had not hidden between me and the Flossie.
The only thing what hid between you his character was this.
She saw soon the type of person who was.
He saw what you wanted what he was seeing.
Because it did not leave it alone?
What is, Mason?
He is the Inspector of the Scotland Yard, man.
And more some persons.
- Do we have to speak even in this?
- Lament, Monsieur Halliday.
It does not serve of anything.
Be well, continue.
I continue without realizing the history of the newspaper.
To beginning, not even I, my friend.
Because Florence would be so desperate to get the newspaper?
One allows me, Mamselle...
Perhaps his companion he was a man driven to despair to know the result of determined race.
Thank you, Mamselle.
Or perhaps his companion he was a man driven to despair to know the result of the fastening of the Stock Exchange.
What absurdity.
I massacred my brain and I made an effort all the grey cells without compassion.
Why would Florence Carrington like so desperately that newspaper?
And what it went to his conclusion?
My conclusion, my friend, it was what it links he did not want it!
So what this concept installed, the truth became quite obvious.
I knew that Florence had been murdered because of the jewels, but also he knew something on the man who killed it.
What he knew?
The man for whom it was looking he was a thief without scruples.
Able to commit the murder of a young woman.
So I looked in the filing cabinets of Beauty queen Lemon and do they know what I discovered?
I discovered a thief of jewels of his name MacKenzie.
The plan was conceived in way not leaving to look what the reason for the crime it had been the jewels.
This color you is very well.
Florence Carrington it was travelling with his jewels alone and left unprotected in the Express of Plymouth.
Monsieur MacKenzie had got a beating the same train in Paddington.
So what the train it was brought near of the station of Bristol, he advanced even to his carriage.
The train brings the Bristol near.
Monsieur MacKenzie goes down for the platform, getting a beating with you not only the jewels, I eat also the luggage of the Lady Carrington.
If someone had looked for the carriage while going out from Bristol, he would have seen the Lady Carrington still with life.
As a matter of fact, in Weston she went out from the train, where it did a great outcry because of a newspaper.
But everything for is certified that the news-dealer would remember her.
But the pathologist he said that she was already killed before the train to bring the Weston near and perhaps before bringing the Bristol near.
And since it is possible?
Will it be that we believe in ghosts?
No.
No, we do not believe.
It did not go to Mademoiselle Florence who was seen in the train for Weston.
It did not go to Mademoiselle Florence who did that outcry in the station.
It was yes, the accomplice of the Monsieur MacKenzie, put on with a coat equally blue.
To kill a human being it is a vile act, my friends but to kill a human being with a knife it is still viler.
You are an authentic lady.
To see the eyes of the victim looking at knots.
To feel his breath in the face.
The knife for between the ribs.
The accomplice of the Monsieur MacKenzie she was a woman called Grace Kidd, what was working for the Lady Carrington under the name of Jane Mason.
Call, Mademoiselle it was even necessary what a woman who never did badly, was it dying?
Could not it have been avoided?
With those jewels we were keeping the solved life.
- Why will it risk?
- It arrives already.
Take it from here, boys.
Poor person Florence.
Poor person dear Florence.
We found the jewels at the home of the Mr. MacKenzie, Mr. Halliday.
They are not mine.
I know the will of my daughter.
They belong to that creature there.
No.
I do not want them.
I do not want to make a profit with the death of the Flossie.
Regrettable.
- I think that I can go away.
- Does he think?
He cannot be a murderer, Monsieur Le Comte, but he is a swindler.
The man goes with me even to the Scotland Yard.
Expensive Mr. Poirot:
it would like thanking for him his help in this tragedy.
His logical and professional method it was something that supported me during my deep despair.
I wait that, in a near future, also I manage to find the same inner calm and perhaps to begin again.
I am going to return the house and to the memory of the happiest times.
Perhaps old friends help me living with the past.
Poor person Monsieur Halliday.
In his letter he says that he is going to return to the Australia to plunge into his work and to try to forget.
And it was extremely generous.
Poor man.
Legendagem:

Subtitling made possible by Acorn Media
[ Doorbell buzzing ]
- Yes, sir?
- Hello there.
You're new, aren't you?
Is there someone you wanted to see, sir?
Well...
Yes, there was, as a matter of fact.
I'd rather like a few quick words with my wife.
MAN:
Paper!
Paper!
- Good morning, sir.
- Good morning.
Have you a suite?
Excuse me.
MAN:
And how long will we be having the pleasure of your patronage, M. le Comte?
Difficult to say.
I have a business in London of an indefinite nature.
Have you a florist's attached to the hotel?
But of course, monsieur.
Excellent.
Suite 37.
Flossie, darling.
Oh.
What the hell are you doing here, Carrington?
Florence doesn't want to see you.
I'd have thought the letter from the lawyer made that perfectly clear.
Well, I'm sure we both want to spare Flossie the embarrassment of airing all our little family secrets.
- Get out of here.
- [ Footsteps ]
Rupert.
I thought it was your voice.
There's no need for you to talk to him, Florence.
There's no need for you to even see him.
But I want to talk to him, Father.
Just for a moment.
Please.
All right.
One minute.
Then I want him out of this house.
He never liked me.
Good heavens.
I can't imagine why.
Look, Flossie...
This legal separation --
It isn't what you want, is it?
Rupert...
The only reason I wanted to be alone with you was to be absolutely certain I'd got you out of my system.
I have.
Goodbye, Rupert.
Flossie, wait.
Look, all right, if that's what you really want.
But, look, you couldn't, um...
I'm in a spot of difficulty.
You mean money.
Not a penny of it.
You've had a good run for my money, but now it's over.
I think you should help me out, Flossie.
What were they standing at at the close yesterday in Sydney?
Listen, the geologist's report is fine.
Couldn't be better.
Where do the rumors start?
Do you know?
Paris?
Who in Paris?
Look, Tommy, hold the bank off.
When the real report's published, those shares are gonna rocket.
Yeah.
Right.
HASTINGS:
I say.
Do you remember those shares Sandy Hacket tipped me to buy?
Shares, Hastings?
The Australian Mining Company.
Yellow Creek.
He said they were about to make some spectacular discovery.
Do not tell me, Hastings.
They are down to five shillings.
Three and six, actually.
I thought you didn't study the stock market.
I do not, Hastings.
I study the psychology.
M. Hacket is what we call the congenital optimist.
The only occasion on which we met, he assured me with the utmost certainty that it would not rain that afternoon because he was going to the garden party.
Yes, I remember.
It bucketed down.
[ Knock on door ]
A Mr. Gordon Halliday is here to see you, Mr. Poirot.
M. Gordon Halliday.
Show him in, by all means, Miss Lemon.
Is that the Australian Gordon Halliday?
Mais oui.
The self-made millionaire par excellence.
But he's the chairman of Yellow Creek Mines.
Do you think he'd advise me?
Hastings, I forbid you to mention it.
M. Halliday is here to ask for advice, not to give it.
Mr. Poirot.
Very good of you to see me without an appointment.
Not at all, M. Halliday.
Not at all.
How may I be of service to you?
Well, actually, it's a little awkward.
[ Slow popular music playing ]
Flowers from M. le Comte again, madam.
Not more of them.
What does he say this time?
"I'm desolated not to have heard from you.
Can it possibly be that I am condemned to take tea alone?
Have pity, my lovely Florence.
Have pity."
He hasn't changed one bit.
Well...
I could do with a bit of cheering up.
Look, Mr. Poirot, money's no object.
I want him got rid of.
Poirot is not in the business of getting rid of people, M. Halliday.
He's not only European, M. Poirot, he's a Frenchman.
And he's not only a Frenchman, he's a wrong un.
[ Sighs ]
You see, it's hard for poor Florence.
Everybody knows she's my only heir.
That scares off all the decent blokes and brings the buzzards flocking.
And this Comte de Rochefour is one of the buzzards.
Yeah.
Knew it as soon as I heard his wings flapping towards us in Paris.
Of course, Florence thought he was the bee's knees.
I had a hell of a job getting her away from him.
I thought I might find her someone more suitable in English society.
The Honorable Rupert Carrington?
Yeah, well, that was out of the frying pan, into the fire with a vengeance.
And now, just as she gets him out of her hair, back out of nowhere comes this so-called count.
Staying at the Adelphi Hotel.
Spending a fortune on roses.
Poirot is not in the business of vetting the potential husbands, M. Halliday.
I cannot help you.
You keep telling me what business you're not in, Mr. Poirot.
Can't you just run your eye over the pipsqueak for me?
You're not a father, Poirot.
You don't know what it's like trying to bring up a daughter all on your own.
No wife to talk it over with.
No one to ask advice.
Very well.
I will run my eye over him for you.
I can tell you where he'll be in half an hour from now.
Unless I'm very pleasantly mistaken,
Florence will be there too.
FLORENCE:
Will you go to Crufts?
Crufts is about the most exciting thing in London this month.
No.
That is not so.
I was devastated when you left Paris, Florence.
I was utterly destroyed.
Well, I'm sorry about Paris.
- My father --
- Ah.
Your father.
Perhaps he will look at me in a better light this time.
Why?
What's different this time?
I have a job.
I think the First National Bank of Paris will carry weight.
Even with him.
Well, Hastings, what do your instincts tell you about our so-elegant count?
Well, not a lot, really.
Just looks like a typical fro--
Typical Frenchman.
I mean typical Frenchman of his type... of Frenchman.
Quite so.
Quite so.
Typical of his type.
Bearer bonds?
Worth 20,000 of your English pounds.
Now, if the bank can trust me to such an extent, so can your father.
So can you.
Perhaps.
Is this something to do with some financial master stroke?
[ Laughs ]
I will tell you all about it when we meet tomorrow.
Oh, not tomorrow, I'm afraid.
Tomorrow I'm going away for the weekend.
I accepted an invitation months ago.
Florence, how can I possibly be without you for another three days now that we have found each other again?
Well, you can always come and see me off if it'll make you feel better.
I'm catching the 12:14 from Paddington -- the Plymouth Express -- and then changing at Bristol.
Come and wave goodbye to me.
It is only for three days.
JANE:
Which of the jewels shall I pack, madam?
FLORENCE:
Oh, I can't decide.
I'll take the jewel case with everything.
JANE:
Do you think that's wise, Miss Florence?
Florence, now just --
Oh, do you have to wear those?
With this?
Don't be silly, Father.
- Pack these, Jane.
- Do you have to take them all?
Daddy, you really do have to stop worrying about me.
Be a dear.
Help Jane with the cases.
Hmm.
150,000 shares, Comte?
150,000.
The Yellow Creek Mining Corporation.
To be sold when they reach £1.
It's my security.
[ Train whistle blows ]
Porter.
Be careful with that.
It's a heavy one.
MAN ON P.A.:
The train now standing on platform one is the 12:14 Plymouth Express via Bristol.
The 12:14 Plymouth Express via Bristol will depart from platform one.
Are you sure you wouldn't rather I stayed with you, madam?
Quite sure.
You go and find your own seat.
Are you expecting company, madam?
Of course not.
Why on earth should I be?
[ Whistle blowing ]
Excuse me.
Do you know if that clock is correct?
No idea, I'm afraid, my dear.
- [ Door closes ]
- HALLIDAY:
Is Poirot in?
I want to see him!
- Right -
- Right this minute.
- LEMON:
Mr. Halliday!
Really!
- [ Footsteps ]
- Florence has disappeared.
You've got to do something, Poirot.
She just disappeared into thin air.
Now, calm yourself, M. Halliday.
How can I?
!
I knew something like this would happen.
Tell me.
She was going away for the weekend.
Her maid's just called from Bristol station.
They were supposed to change there, only, apparently, Florence stayed on the train.
Said she had some business further on.
Now, did she specify what business?
No, no, she just said that she'd get the first train back to Bristol, and then they'd go on together.
Well, that is not necessarily to worry, my friend.
But that was over three hours ago, Poirot.
There's still no sign of her.
I see.
What really worries me is that when the maid went along to Florence's compartment at Bristol, there was a man in it with her.
MAN ON P.A.:
Train now arriving on platform one is the 12:14 from Paddington.
This is Plymouth.
Plymouth station.
The train now arriving on platform one is the 12:14 from Paddington.
MAN:
Going on to Penzance, are you, sir?
MAN:
Paper!
Paper!
Extra!
Extra!
Body found on train!
Paper!
Paper!
Extra!
Extra!
What's it all for, Poirot?
You're a clever man.
You tell me that.
My dear friend.
I am so very, very sorry.
You find her murderer, Poirot,
I'll make you richer than you ever dreamed.
Halliday, my friend, it is not a question of money.
Believe me, I also shall not rest until the murderer is brought to justice.
Now, it is essential that I speak with the maid at the earliest possible moment.
She's in the breakfast room.
The police are questioning her right this minute.
I tell you, I never saw his face.
JAPP:
That's a bit hard to credit.
Well, she made sure that I didn't.
Mrs. Carrington.
She was standing in the doorway when we got to Bristol with the luggage already out in the corridor.
I just caught a glimpse of him over her shoulder.
He had his back to me.
Well, you must have noticed something.
I told you.
He was tall.
He had on a dark suit.
And I think...
I'm almost positive that his hair was dark too, but that's all I remember.
Hello, Poirot.
Hastings.
I heard you were here.
Nasty business, this.
Oui, d'accord.
A genuine tragedy.
If I may?
Mademoiselle.
Did he seem to you in any way familiar?
No, I don't...
I don't think he did.
Could it have been Mrs. Carrington's husband?
Well, I only saw him once.
I suppose it could have been.
POIROT:
Have you ever met a man who calls himself le Comte de Rochefour?
- No, sir.
- Bien.
Thank you very much, mademoiselle.
So...
After you'd caught a glimpse of this man you might or might not have seen before, then what happened?
I told you.
Mrs. Carrington said she had business on the train and that I was to take the luggage and wait for her.
Mr. Halliday tells me that Mrs. Carrington had a lot of jewelry with her in a blue morocco traveling case.
That wasn't with the stuff you took off the train?
Oh, no, sir.
She kept that with her.
What do you think, Poirot?
I presume that the traveling case of blue morocco was not discovered with the body.
You presume 100% correct.
Mind you, that doesn't necessarily signify.
For whatever reason the murderer had for killing her, he'd be a fool to let a bag full of valuable jewelry go begging.
Or perhaps he took it to distract us from his real motive.
Taxi!
How long had she been dead when the body was discovered at Plymouth?
About three hours, the doctor says.
After Bristol, the train stops at Weston, then not again until Taunton.
According to the pathologist, she was killed soon after the train left Weston, at the very latest.
Possibly before.
Before the train reached Weston even?
Could be.
The train for Plymouth departs from Paddington station at 14 minutes past 12:00, does it not?
12:14, yes.
Hastings, what do you say to an invigorating ride into the West Country?
Weston station.
Dead on time.
Exactly 25 past 3:00.
Excellent.
And exactly 35 minutes after leaving Bristol, at which time yesterday
Mme. Carrington was alive and well.
The question is, Hastings, was Mme. Carrington still alive and well at this moment?
And if she was alive and well, did she remain in the carriage or did she descend from the train onto the platform,
perhaps to stretch the legs, take in the fresh air?
And did anybody see her doing it?
Précisément.
- Perhaps we should ask a porter.
- NEWSBOY:
Papers!
Yes, we could.
Or...
Or possibly, Hastings...
Papers!
Papers!
Get your papers here!
Papers!
Excuse me.
No, no, no, no.
No.
No, thank you.
You have the appearance of a bright, observant young lad.
That's what my mum says.
Tell me.
I want you to try to remember, at precisely this time yesterday, did you see descending from the train a woman?
A handsome young woman in a blue -- a blue hat and coat, perhaps?
She bought a newspaper off you, huh?
- You mean the Australian lady.
- So you remember her?
I couldn't forget her, gov.
Not with all the fuss she was making.
- Fuss?
- Yeah.
She kept going on about wanting a late edition of the paper.
Any paper.
Well, I told her I only had the early edition, but she wouldn't believe me.
Kept going on, saying, "I must have one,"
as though her life were at stake.
I see -
- Pardon.
- And, uh...
- Come, children.
Did she give to you any reason why she was so desperate to acquire this late edition?
No, she just kept saying, "He'll be so angry,"
and looking back at the train like someone was on it waiting for her.
- And then?
- Well, nothing.
She just kept going on and on until she nearly missed her train.
She only just managed to jump back on it as it was moving.
[ Train whistle blows ]
Thank you very much.
Early edition, late edition, early edition, late edition.
Superbe, Miss Lemon.
I knew that you could arrange it.
Difficulties are made to be overcome, Mr. Poirot.
"Difficulties are made to be overcome."
What a truly magnificent attitude.
[ Doorbell buzzes ]
So, Hastings, let us divide these between us
and examine them minutely.
[ Door closes ]
Inspector Japp.
- POIROT:
Chief Inspector.
- Poirot.
Hello.
What's this?
You looking for a job?
No, I know.
You've had a chat with that newsboy.
You think there's something in it?
That is what we are trying to discover, Chief Inspector.
JAPP:
Hmm.
Well, I just thought I'd come and tell you, you could be on the right track with that French gent.
Apparently, he left the Adelphi at 11:00 yesterday morning, an hour before the express left Paddington, and didn't get back till gone 10:00 in the evening.
And nobody has any idea where he spent the day.
However, we picked him up trying to catch the boat train this morning.
We just stopped him for questioning, and he made a run for it.
He's down at the station now.
These papers have probably got nothing to do with it.
Oh, no, no, no, Chief Inspector.
When we shall discover why Mme. Carrington was so anxious to acquire a late edition then we shall know why she was killed and who is responsible.
Another one.
I don't think I can, Mr. Carrington.
I'm sorry.
What do you mean, don't think you can?
Well, for one thing, sir, I think you've had enough.
And for another, there is the question of your bill.
- Who are you?
- Arthur Hastings.
You know this fellow won't give me a drink, Arthur Hastings.
Really?
Well, perhaps I'll have more luck.
Two large Scotches, please.
Had a bit of luck at Ascot yesterday.
Don't talk to me about Ascot.
Horses.
What were you on in the 3:30?
I bet you were on Highland Laddie.
Yes, I was, as a matter of fact.
I hate people like you.
33 to 1.
I put my shirt on Rising Star.
Rising Star.
Every penny I had in the world on that nag.
[ Cash register dings ]
My last chance.
Must have given you a nasty shock when you read the result in the paper.
Shock?
Do you know why I'm here?
This is the only place I know where my bookmaker can't get at me.
[ Chuckles ]
I mean, I don't want to sit here drinking.
I actually dislike drink.
Do you know that?
Why did you back Highland Laddie?
Oh, I had a tip.
I really dislike people who get tips.
Thank you.
You're a good chap, though.
You've got to be fair.
How did you know I read about it in the paper?
Oh, you said.
You said you weren't at the course.
Did I say that?
You are a good chap.
Every penny I had.
I looked at that newspaper.
I could be a success, you know, if I just had the capital.
And tips.
Isn't there anyone you could go to for capital?
Not a soul in the world.
Not now.
I don't want to talk about that.
I demand to see the French consul.
JAPP:
All in good time, M. le Comte.
This is a serious business.
I know nothing of the death of Mrs. Carrington, I tell you.
I am devastated by it.
I'm rather more interested in these things for the moment.
[ Knock on door ]
Mr. Halliday is here, sir.
- JAPP:
Show him in.
- Very good, sir.
Mr. Halliday.
M. Halliday, I am devastated for you.
Now, the count says he last saw your daughter when he had tea with her at the Adelphi on Wednesday.
Yeah, he did have tea with her.
One interesting thing, though, Mr. Halliday, is that he had these with him.
Bearer bonds.
And what the count can't tell us, you see, is what sort of financial dealings would require him to bring £20,000 worth of these bonds into England and then take them back again to Paris three days later.
Well, he was obviously using them as security.
JAPP:
Security for what?
That is my bank's business.
Not according to them, it isn't, sir.
I rang them up, you see?
They're quite anxious to have a word with you.
What, uh -- What bank are we talking about?
JAPP:
The International Bank of Paris.
Wait a minute.
I know what he wanted the security for.
10 days ago, somebody started a rumor that a geologist's report on one of my mines was gonna be unfavorable.
The shares plummeted.
You must have made a real killing.
He'd have bought the shares at about three shillings and sold them the day after the real report came out and they went back up again to about 20.
Making about £100,000.
This sounds like something for the fraud department.
Fraud?
[ Laughs ]
What fraud?
It's normal business practice.
No wonder you were so anxious to get hold of a late edition.
He went down to Ascot, put everything he had on Rising Star.
As soon as he knew the horse had lost, he asked Florence for a loan.
She refused him.
Right, Poirot, the frog's cracked.
I knew it.
What he was reckoning was he'd use Mrs. Carrington as a backup in case his deal went wrong.
No, no, no.
He lost every penny he had at the races.
- Races?
Who had?
What races?
- Rupert Carrington.
No, no, it's got nothing to do with Carrington.
Please, please, please, my friends.
If you please.
How can I possibly arbitrate between your two ingenious theories if I can hardly distinguish one word of them?
Now, Chief inspector, your theory, as I understand it, is that the Comte de Rochefour intended to use Mme. Carrington as a fall back on.
If the takeover deal went wrong, he would then demand of her the money in order to redeem the bonds.
He's admitted as much.
But the deal, it did not go wrong, did it?
So why should the count kill for the jewels of Mme. Carrington?
Whereas, Hastings, your theory is that when M. Carrington discovered that his certain winner fell at the last fence, he then demanded from his wife the money in order to remove the threat of the bookmakers.
And when she refused, he killed her for her jewelry.
Exactly.
Then you tell me, Hastings, why does M. Carrington still lurk about his club, drinking himself into oblivion and shaking with fear of what they might do to him, these very same bookmakers?
Bon.
These feverish speculations, they will not do.
Order and method will be our guides.
Now, I have been consulting the admirable files of Miss Lemon.
So, Chief inspector, get four of your best men and meet us at this address at 9:00.
Find the jewels, and you'll find the killer.
What's happening?
Nothing.
He's knocking at the door.
[ Door opens ]
Hold on.
Someone's answered.
He's gone in.
I wish I knew what he was up to.
I'm not quite clear what this is about, Mister...
A friend advised me to get in touch with you.
Friend?
What friend?
He prefers to remain anonymous.
Oh, yes.
I don't think I care for anonymous friends.
My friend is anxious to buy some jewelry.
Plenty of shops around.
You look like a jeweler.
[ Chuckles ] You're very acute, monsieur.
Very well.
Perhaps you read of the jewelry robbery the day before yesterday on the Plymouth Express?
I don't read that sort of trash.
You are very wise, monsieur.
There is blood on those jewels.
It will make them very hard to sell.
You're a funny little fellow, aren't you?
What are you?
Montenegrin?
Polish?
Belgian, M. McKenzie.
You see, those jewels will have to be broken up, removed from their setting.
And whoever tries to sell them will be lucky to receive one-sixth of their true value.
I don't know what your game is, monsieur.
I really don't.
My friend is a truly private collector.
He would not be so fussy.
He would not care if the jewelry were left in its original condition.
In fact, he would prefer it.
Let's hope it stays fine for him.
You got the wrong shop.
None of this means anything to me.
I see.
Sorry I couldn't be of any help.
We all have false hopes, M. McKenzie.
How'd it go, Poirot?
It is him.
He denies all knowledge, of course.
But there is on the coat rack a duplicate of the coat Mme. Carrington was wearing at the time of her death.
Why did he need a duplicate?
For his accomplice to wear, Hastings.
I didn't know he had an accomplice.
But of course he did.
That is how I was able to locate him.
Right.
Come on, lads.
This is the police!
Open this door!
All right.
Break the door down.
JANE:
Mr. Halliday's dining.
[ Speaks indistinctly ]
I want a word with you, Mr. Halliday.
You weren't welcome when my daughter was alive.
- [ Doorbell buzzes ]
- You're even less welcome now.
I don't care if I'm welcome or not.
Why should you have an easy conscience?
This horror would never have happened if you hadn't come between Flossie and me.
The only thing that came between you and Florence was your character.
She saw you for what you were.
No, she saw what you wanted her to see.
You could never let her go, could you?
Yeah, what is it, Mason?
It's the inspector from Scotland Yard, sir.
And a lot of other people.
[ Sighs ]
Do we have to talk about this?
I am afraid that we do, M. Halliday.
Does no good.
Okay.
Go on.
I still don't understand the business about the newspapers.
Neither did I at first, my friend.
Why should Florence be so desperate to procure this newspaper?
Please, mademoiselle, allow me.
Perhaps her companion was a man who was desperate to know the results of a particular race.
Thank you, mademoiselle.
Or perhaps her companion was a man who desperately needed to know the close-of-day figures on the stock market.
Absurd.
I tormented my brain.
I agitated the little gray cells without mercy.
Why did Florence Carrington so desperately want that newspaper?
And what was the answer?
The answer.
The answer, my friend, was that she did not.
Now, once this idea presented itself to me, the truth, it soon became very clear.
You see, I knew Florence was murdered because of her jewels, but I also knew something about the man who killed her.
JAPP:
Knew what?
The man I was looking for had to be a thief of the most steelhearted, one capable of committing the senseless murder of an innocent young woman.
So I looked in the files of Miss Lemon, and what do I find?
I find a jewel thief by the name of McKenzie.
A plan is devised which will suggest that the theft of the jewels are not the principal cause of the crime that is to take place.
That color really suits you.
POIROT:
Florence Carrington is traveling with the jewels alone and unprotected on the Plymouth Express.
M. McKenzie has also boarded the train at Paddington.
Just as the train reaches Bristol station, he advances towards her carriage.
Aah!
Oh!
The train arrives at Bristol.
M. McKenzie descends from the train carrying with him not only the jewels but also the baggage of Mme. Carrington.
Now, if anybody had looked at the carriage as the train left Bristol station, they would have noticed Mme. Carrington alive and well.
Indeed, at Weston she apparently descended from the train onto the platform, where she made a great fuss about acquiring the late edition.
But this was to ensure that the newspaper boy would remember her.
Hang on a minute.
The pathologist said she was dead before the train reached Weston.
Maybe even before Bristol.
Précisément, mon ami.
So how is this possible?
Do we believe in ghosts?
No.
No, we do not.
It was not poor Mlle. Florence who was seen traveling on the train to Weston.
It was not Mlle. Florence who made at Weston station the fracas.
It was the accomplice of M. McKenzie, wearing the duplicate blue coat.
To kill a fellow human being is vile, my friends.
But I wonder if to kill a fellow human being with a knife is not the most vile.
You look a proper lady.
POIROT:
To see the eyes of the victim staring into yours, to feel the breath upon her face, the scrape of the knifepoint between her ribs.
You see, the ruthless accomplice of M. McKenzie was a woman called Grace Kidd,
who was employed by Mme. Carrington under the name of Jane Mason.
Tell me, mademoiselle, was it absolutely necessary for a poor, wretched woman -- who had never done to you one moment's harm -- to die?
Was there no other way?
Oh, my God!
Those jewels would have set us up for the rest of our lives.
Why take chances?
JAPP:
Right.
That'll be enough of that.
Take her away, lads.
Poor Florence.
Poor, dear Florence.
We found the jewel case in McKenzie's house, Mr. Halliday.
They're not mine.
I know the contents of my daughter's will.
They belong to that creature there.
No.
No, I don't want them.
I'm not going to profit by Flossie's death.
ROCHEFOUR:
Most sad.
Most sad.
I shall go now, I think.
Oh, you think so, do you?
You may not be a murderer, M. Ie Comte, but you're still a swindler.
You're coming back to Scotland Yard.
[ Door opens ]
[ Door closes ]
HALLIDAY:
Dear Mr. Poirot,
I would like to express my gratitude for your help in this tragic business.
Your logical and businesslike approach was something I could cling to in the depths of my despair.
I hope sometime in the future to be able to find a measure of such quiet strength.
Then, perhaps, I can start again.
I'm returning home to the memory of happier times.
Old friends may help me live with the past.
Poor M. Halliday.
He says in his letter that he will return to Australia, immerse himself in his work, and try to forget.
He has been most excessive in his generosity.
Poor man.

The EXPRESS OF PLYMOUTH
- Yes?
- Very good afternoon.
Are you new here, is not you?
Does it want to speak with someone, gentleman?
Good ... by chance I want, yes.
It would like giving a chat to my woman.
Newspaper!
Newspaper!
Newspaper!
- Good morning, gentleman.
- Good morning.
Does it have any available suite?
As how much time will we have the honor of his visit, Mr. does It read Comte?
I still do not know.
I have business to negotiate in London for indeterminate time.
- Is there some florist in the hotel?
- Certainly, gentleman.
Excellent.
Suite 37.
Darling Flossie...
Which ray does it do here, Carrington?
Florence does not want to see it.
I thought that the letter of his lawyer it had been quite explicit.
Certainly we want both to avoid some embarrassment to the Flossie with the spread of some secrets of family...
Disappear from here!
Your voice seemed to hear me, Rupert...
There is no need of speaking with him, Florence.
Not so little there is need of receiving.
But I want to speak with him, father.
Only for a little time, please.
It is well.
A minute.
Then I want it out of this house.
- He never liked me.
- Do not say to me!
I do not manage to imagine why...
Listening, Flossie...
as for our divorce it is really that that you want?
Rupert only I agreed in speaking with you alone, to make sure of what I already feel nothing for you.
And it is the case.
- Goodbye, Rupert.
- Wait, Flossie...
It is well, one is what you want.
But it will be that you could...
- I am with some problems.
- Do you want money?
Not even a cash.
You already used yourself the sufficient thing of my money, but that finished.
I find better you help me, Flossie.
What the situation was to the fastening of yesterday, in Sydney?
The report of the geologist is the best, it could not be better.
But where these rumours appeared?
In Paris?
But who, in Paris?
He sees if you stand the bank, Tommy.
When the true report it will be published, the actions are going to fire.
Yes.
It is well.
You remind of yourself of the actions that the Hacket did he advise me to buy?
Which actions, Hastings?
Of that mining Australian group.
Yellow Creek.
He said that they were ready doing a fabulous discovery.
Do not say to me, Hastings:
they are to five shillings.
3.6, to be right.
I thought that you were not interested for the Stock Exchange.
And not, Hastings.
I study psychology.
Monsieur Hacket is what one calls a congenital optimist.
In the only time that we passed by each other, it guaranteed me with all the certainty what in this afternoon would not rain since it was going to a party in the open air.
Yes, I remember.
It rained cats and dogs.
A Mr is here.
Gordon Halliday to see it, Mr. Poirot.
"Monsieur" Gordon Halliday?
- Tell it to enter, Beauty queen Lemon.
- The Australian Gordon Halliday?
The millionaire what was done by own you.
He is a president of the Yellow Creek Mines "!
Do you find what it will be able to advise to me?
You are prohibited to speak in the subject.
The Monsieur Halliday it is here to be advised and not to advise.
Mr. Poirot.
It is a great sympathy to receive me without marking.
Of all, of all.
In what I him can be a usefulness?
It is a somewhat delicate subject...
You.
It reads Comte it ordered him flowers again, my lady.
Again?
What says the card?
I am completely distressed without his news.
It will be possible what I am condemned going to drink alone tea?
Have piety, beautiful Florence.
Have piety.
He did not change anything.
Good ...
I was making distracting well.
The money is not a problem, Mr. Poirot.
I want to be free of him.
The Poirot does not treat this type of subjects, Mr. Halliday.
He not only is European, Sr. Poirot, since he is a French.
And not only he is a French, like swindler.
It is very difficult for Florence.
They all know that she is my heiress.
That frightens the decent types and it attracts the self-seeking ones.
And this such a Comte de Rochefour is he one of these self-seeking ones?
He knew it so that I saw it in Paris, smelling of our turn.
Clear that Florence found it the maximum.
I was worried to get rid of him.
I found what perhaps should know someone in the high English society.
Like Honorary Rupert Carrington?
Yes.
It was a worse the correction than the sonnet.
And now that she was free of him, this supposed Count appears put up in the hotel Adelphi and spending a fortune in roses.
The Poirot has not for custom potential husbands veto,
Monsieur Halliday.
I am not going to be able to help it.
Only he has been saying to me what it does not do, Mr. Poirot.
It will be that it cannot give a peep to this aldrabão, for me?
The man is not a father, Poirot.
It does not do idea of the difficult thing that is to raise a daughter alone, without a wife to accompany me, nobody whom asking for advices...
Very well.
I give him a peep for you.
I can tell him where he will be from here the half hour.
Unless I am wrong very much, Florence will be there also.
Does not it go to the Crufts?
It must be the event more exciting of this month, in London.
That is not true.
I was devastated when it left Paris, Florence.
I was completely finished.
Immense lament that one of Paris.
My father...
His father!
Perhaps this time he sees me with other eyes.
- Why?
What changed?
- I have a job.
Dressing what the First National Bank of Paris have some weight even before his father.
And then, Hastings?
What he says to him his instinct on the count?
Very little, to say the truth.
And a "franciú" típ a typical French.
I want to say, he is a typical French of his type of French.
There that is true...
typical of his type.
- Actions to a bearer?
- In the value for 20 thousand pounds of yours.
If the bank it trusts me to this point, his father also can trust.
And you also.
Perhaps.
This has something to do with some financial master-stroke?
- Tomorrow I tell everything to him.
- Lament, but tomorrow, no.
I am going to pass on weekend it had been.
There are months that I accepted the invitation.
Since I can pass three distant days of you, now that did we meet ourselves again?
It can be going to say goodbye to me, if that makes it be felt better.
I am going to catch the train of the 12.14 H in Paddington.
The Express of Plymouth, with change in Bristol.
Come to be dismissed of me.
They are only three days.
Which jewels must I pack, my lady?
I do not manage to make up my mind.
I take the box with all.
Does it find sensibly, Beauty queen Florence?
Florence, I find what...
Do you have to use even that?
With this dress?
Do not be stupid, a father.
- It puts these, Jane in order.
- Do you have to take even all?
You did not have to worry so much about me, papa.
Be a darling and it helps Jane to take the suitcases.
150 thousand actions, Comte?
150 thousand.
The Yellow Creek Mining Corporation.
To be sold when they are to a pound.
She is my security.
Be careful with that.
They are weighed.
The train parked in the platform 1 he is the Express of the 12. 14 H de Plymouth road Bristol.
The Express of the 12. 14 H de Plymouth road Bristol 1 will leave from the platform.
He is sure what he does not want that it keeps you?
I have, yes.
It can be going to look for a place.
It is waiting for company, my lady?
Clear what not.
Because it would be?
Want to excuse...
does he know if that clock is certain?
I do not do the least idea.
Is the Poirot?
I want to see it immediately.
In this instant.
Florence disappeared!
It will do something, Poirot.
Simply it disappeared.
- One abates, Monsieur Halliday.
- How I can?
!
I knew that something so it would happen!
She had been going to pass on weekend it had been.
The servant tied me of Bristol.
They must have changed of train, but Florence stayed in the train, he said that it had things to negotiate.
- Did it specify which things would be?
- No, no.
Only he said that he would return in the first train for Bristol and what then would be still joined.
It is not a reason for preoccupation...
But that was that there are three hours and there is still no her sign.
I am seeing...
What more preoccupies me is what when the servant entered in the carriage in Bristol, he saw a man with her.
The train that is submitting in the platform 1, it is it of the 12. 14 H, coming from Paddington.
This is the station of Plymouth.
The train that is submitting in the platform 1, it is it of the 12. 14 H, coming from Paddington.
Newspaper!
Extra!
Extra!
Because these things happen, Poirot?
You are an intelligent man, answer me.
My expensive friend ... immense lament.
Discover the murderer, Poirot and I will do from you a very rich man.
Halliday, my friend, it is not a question of money.
Believe that I also will not rest while it will not take the murderer to the justice.
But it is essential what speaks it more quickly possible with the servant.
It is in the room of meals.
The police officer is now questioning it.
He said already to him:
I did not come seeing the face.
It costs to me believing in that...
She made sure of that itself...
you.
Carrington.
When we brought the Bristol near, she was already at the door, with the luggage in the corridor.
Only I saw it of glance, for top of her shoulder.
He was of back.
It must to me have repaired them in some thing.
He said already to him: it was high, it was wearing a dark suit and I find what I am almost sure what had dark hair, but I do not remember of more at all.
Good afternoon, Poirot.
Hastings.
They told me that it was here.
This was completely very unpleasant.
An authentic tragedy.
One allows me, Mamselle did he seem to him known?
No ...
I cannot say what yes.
It might be the husband of the Mrs. Carrington?
Only I saw it once ... but perhaps work hard.
Already sometime he saw a man who gives for the name of Comte de Rochefour?
No, man.
Very much thank you, Mamselle.
And after having seen of glance this man who has, perhaps yes or perhaps not, I put on previously, what happened?
- He said already to him.
You.
Carrington said what it had subjects to negotiate in the train and in order that I leave with the luggage and to hope for her.
You.
Halliday said to me what you.
Carrington it was taking with her a travel suitcase blue, with immense jewels.
Also did it take this suitcase?
No, man.
That kept her.
What it finds, Poirot?
I calculate that the suitcase of blue travel was not it found next to the body?
And it makes calculations very well.
But that is not necessarily significant.
Whichever the motive was of the murderer, it would be crazy not to get a beating a suitcase full of valuable jewels.
Perhaps it was taking it to distract us of the true motive.
There is how much time was killed, when it was found in Plymouth?
According to the doctor, to around three hours.
After Bristol, the train stops in Weston and only it stops again in Taunton.
According to the pathologist, she was murdered somewhat then of the train to have left Weston, or even even before.
- Before bringing the Weston near?
- And possible.
The train of Plymouth goes out from the station of Paddington ás 12.14 H, is not it so?
Yes, ás 12.14 H.
What you say to me to a realive walk for the field, Hastings?
Estacão of Weston.
And to the marked hour.
There are exactamente 15.25 H.
Excellent.
And exactamente 35 minutes after to go out from Bristol this hour in what yesterday, the Lady Carrington it was still meeting with life.
The question is, Hastings she will be the Lady Carrington was it still alive in this stopping?
And if it was lively, it will be that it remained in the carriage, or it will have gone down even to the platform,
perhaps to stretch the legs, to catch a little air...
And will there be anybody who has seen it?
- We could ask a signalman.
- Yes, we could.
Or perhaps, Hastings...
Newspapers!
Buy here your newspapers!
Excuse ... no, thank you.
It seems to you to be an observant young person.
My mother says that yes.
One remembers of yesterday, exactamente to this hour, to have seen to go down of the train a pretty young person put on as coat and hat blue...
Perhaps he has bought a newspaper...
- The Australian lady?
- One remembers, so?
How could it her forget, chief?
It did an enormous outcry.
- An outcry?
- Yes he wanted by force the last print run of a newspaper.
He told him that it only had print runs you awake early, it did not believe them to me, it was always saying:
I need a newspaper!
, like if the life was depending on that.
It let to him some reason to want desperately the last print run?
No, only he was saying:
He is going to grow so angry!
it was looking at the train, since they were waiting for her.
- And then?
- Not at all, it gorged itself of bursting up to almost losing the train.
It jumped for the train practically in movement.
Very much thank you.
Morning print run, last print run.
Morning print run, last print run.
Fantastic, Beauty queen Lemon.
I knew what I would get.
The difficulties were done to be exceeded, Mr. Poirot.
The difficulties were done to be exceeded what praiseworthy attitude.
Very well, Hastings let's divide this between us and let's examine them thoroughly...
The Inspector Japp.
- Inspector-chief...
- Poirot.
What we have here?
Does it walk to the search of job?
No, I know that it talked with the news-dealer.
Does it think that there can be there something?
It is that that we are trying to discover, Inspector-chief.
I found that he better will see him saying what must be in the certain way as for that French man.
Apparently it left the Adelphi ás 11.00 H of yesterday, an hour before of the Express to go out from Paddington and he did not return even after the 22.00 H.
And nobody knows where it passed the day.
We caught it this morning, trying to catch the train.
We boarded it to be questioned and it tried to escape.
It is at this moment in the squad.
These newspapers have nothing to do.
No, not, Inspector-chief.
When we will know because the fact is that the Lady Carrington it was so anxious because of buying the last print run, we will discover the motive by which it was murdered and the one who was the person in charge.
- More one.
- Lament, but not, Mr. Carrington.
- What it means, " do not prune "?
- Because it already drank the sufficient thing and there is still the question of the count...
- Who is you?
- Arthur Hastings.
This type does not want to give me a drink, Arthur Hastings.
To serious?
Perhaps I have more luck.
Two uísques doubles, please.
- Yesterday I escaped well in Ascot.
- Do not talk to me about Ascot.
Horses!
In which did it bet on that of the 15.30 H?
- Apposition that was in the "Highland Laddie"!
- Yes, by chance even it was.
I hate people like you. 33 to one.
I bet everything on the "Rising Star".
" Rising Star "!
All my money in that jade!
To mine last opportunity.
It is necessary to have been a shock when it read the result in the newspaper.
A shock?
Does he know because I am here?
It is the only siege where my broker does not catch me.
I do not want to be here drinking.
Does he know that I do not even like drinking?
- Because it bet on the "Highland Laddie"?
- They gave me a hint.
I hate persons who receive hints.
Thank you.
I me them will be just, you are a good person.
- How he knows that I read in the newspaper?
- He said that it was not in the racecourse.
Did I say that?
You are an even good person.
All my money!
When I looked at the newspaper...
I could be well an event, the capital had been.
And the hints.
There is nobody to whom could it resort for capital?
Not even the only person.
Now already not.
I prefer not to speak on that.
- I demand to see the French consul.
- Completely at his time, Mr. It reads Comte.
This is a very serious subject.
He already told him that I know nothing on the death of the Mrs. Carrington.
- I am distressed by the piece of news.
- I am more interested in this.
- You.
Halliday arrived already.
- Tell it to enter.
Mr. Halliday.
Monsieur Halliday, my deep feelings.
The count says what his daughter saw for the last time when they took tea in Wednesday.
Yes, they took tea joined.
The most interesting thing, Mr. Halliday, the fact is that it was bringing this with him.
Actions to a bearer.
But the count does not want to say us which business type makes be brought by it 20 thousand pounds, to take them of turn for Paris, three days later...
It is obvious what was using them like a sort of security.
- Security why?
- This is a subject of my bank.
I do not second them to myself they, gentleman.
I phoned they.
They are anxious to speak with you.
- Which bank does one treat?
- The International Bank of Paris.
Wait there!
I know already for what the security guard wanted.
There are ten days, the rumour was launched what a geological report on one of my mines it would be unfavorable.
The actions fell dizzily.
He must have done a fortune.
He must have bought them to 3 shillings and sold in the following day to the true report to be published, when they rose for 20.
Doing a profit of around 100 thousand pounds.
It seems to me a subject for the department of fraud.
Fraud?
Which fraud?
They are business practices perfectly normal.
It does not admire what was so anxious for the last print run.
LAST HOUR:
RECUPERATION OF YELLOW CREEK
He was up to Ascot and it bet everything what had in the "Rising Star".
So what he knew what the horse had lost, it asked for a loan Florence.
She refused and...
Good, the franciú gave to the gullet.
I knew.
He wanted to use you.
Carrington like reserve, if the plan failed...
- No!
It had lost in the races...
- Run?
Which races?
Rupert Carrington. " Rising Star ".
It has not to do with the Carrington.
Please, my friends!
Since I can choose between both theories, if I hardly realize a word?
His theory, Inspector-chief, such as I understood it, the fact is that the Comte de Rochefour it was intending to use the Lady Carrington as reserve.
If the business was running badly, money would borrow from him, so to recover the actions.
- He already admitted it.
- But the business did not run badly.
Because it would kill the Comte to obtain the jewels of the Lady Carrington?
On the other side, Hastings, your theory defends what when Monsieur Carrington it discovered what the horse had lost, it demanded the money to the woman, to put an end to the brokers and what when she refused, did it kill it to keep the jewels?
Exactamente!
Then it explains me, Hastings, because it will be that the Monsieur Carrington is still put in the bar, drinking up to any more not being able and shuddering of fear of what could the brokers do to him?
These speculations of nothing serve.
Order and method will be our guides.
I have been consulting the incredible filing cabinets of the Beauty queen Lemon.
So, Inspector-chief, choice four of his best men and they meet me to this residence, ás 21.00 H.
Discover the jewels and it will discover the murderer.
- What is happening?
- It swims.
It is knocking at the door.
Wait, someone answered.
He entered.
Who had given me knowledge what walks he conspiring.
I did not realize very well to what it comes, Sr...?
A friend he advised me to speak with you.
A friend?
That I make friends?
- He prefers to maintain the anonymity.
- Yes?
I do not like a great deal of anonymous friends.
My friend is anxious because of buying pieces of jewelry store.
There are thereabouts immense shops.
- You have face of jeweller.
- And very observant, gallant.
So well.
Perhaps have read something on the theft of the day before yesterday in the Express of Plymouth?
- I do not read this filth.
- And it does very well, Monsieur.
These jewels made gushing blood.
They will be very difficult to sell.
You are a character somewhat strange.
Of where it comes?
Is it montenegrino?
Pole?
I am a Belgian, Monsieur MacKenzie.
These jewels will be broken, pulls of the frames.
Who will try to sell them, with great luck only it will get a sixth one of his value.
I do not know which his move, " monsieur.
Really I do not know.
My friend is a true one particular collector, it would not be strange at all.
It would not be preoccupied if the jewels they were in his original form.
In fact, he would prefer.
Let's wait then what is lucky.
It was deceived in the shop.
Nothing from that does sense for me.
I am seeing.
I lament not to have when he could be helped.
All of we have false hopes, Mr. MacKenzie.
- How it ran?
- It is he.
It denies any knowledge, but in the hanger a coat is equal to what you.
Carrington it was using in the height of his death.
- Why would he like an equal?
- For his accomplice, Hastings.
- He did not know that it had an accomplice.
- But it is obvious that yes.
- It was therefore that I located it.
- We go to this, boys.
Open the door, she is the police officer!
Knock the door down.
I want to give him a chat, Mr. Halliday.
It was not welcome when my daughter was alive.
Now it is still less.
That does not interest me.
Because there is of to be of calm conscience?
This tragedy would never have happened if it had not hidden between me and the Flossie.
The only thing what hid between you his character was this.
She saw soon the type of person who was.
He saw what you wanted what he was seeing.
Because it did not leave it alone?
What is, Mason?
He is the Inspector of the Scotland Yard, man.
And more some persons.
- Do we have to speak even in this?
- Lament, Monsieur Halliday.
It does not serve of anything.
Be well, continue.
I continue without realizing the history of the newspaper.
To beginning, not even I, my friend.
Because Florence would be so desperate to get the newspaper?
One allows me, Mamselle...
Perhaps his companion he was a man driven to despair to know the result of determined race.
Thank you, Mamselle.
Or perhaps his companion he was a man driven to despair to know the result of the fastening of the Stock Exchange.
What absurdity.
I massacred my brain and I made an effort all the grey cells without compassion.
Why would Florence Carrington like so desperately that newspaper?
And what it went to his conclusion?
My conclusion, my friend, it was what it links he did not want it!
So what this concept installed, the truth became quite obvious.
I knew that Florence had been murdered because of the jewels, but also he knew something on the man who killed it.
What he knew?
The man for whom it was looking he was a thief without scruples.
Able to commit the murder of a young woman.
So I looked in the filing cabinets of Beauty queen Lemon and do they know what I discovered?
I discovered a thief of jewels of his name MacKenzie.
The plan was conceived in way not leaving to look what the reason for the crime it had been the jewels.
This color you is very well.
Florence Carrington it was travelling with his jewels alone and left unprotected in the Express of Plymouth.
Monsieur MacKenzie had got a beating the same train in Paddington.
So what the train it was brought near of the station of Bristol, he advanced even to his carriage.
The train brings the Bristol near.
Monsieur MacKenzie goes down for the platform, getting a beating with you not only the jewels, I eat also the luggage of the Lady Carrington.
If someone had looked for the carriage while going out from Bristol, he would have seen the Lady Carrington still with life.
As a matter of fact, in Weston she went out from the train, where it did a great outcry because of a newspaper.
But everything for is certified that the news-dealer would remember her.
But the pathologist he said that she was already killed before the train to bring the Weston near and perhaps before bringing the Bristol near.
And since it is possible?
Will it be that we believe in ghosts?
No.
No, we do not believe.
It did not go to Mademoiselle Florence who was seen in the train for Weston.
It did not go to Mademoiselle Florence who did that outcry in the station.
It was yes, the accomplice of the Monsieur MacKenzie, put on with a coat equally blue.
To kill a human being it is a vile act, my friends but to kill a human being with a knife it is still viler.
You are an authentic lady.
To see the eyes of the victim looking at knots.
To feel his breath in the face.
The knife for between the ribs.
The accomplice of the Monsieur MacKenzie she was a woman called Grace Kidd, what was working for the Lady Carrington under the name of Jane Mason.
Call, Mademoiselle it was even necessary what a woman who never did badly, was it dying?
Could not it have been avoided?
With those jewels we were keeping the solved life.
- Why will it risk?
- It arrives already.
Take it from here, boys.
Poor person Florence.
Poor person dear Florence.
We found the jewels at the home of the Mr. MacKenzie, Mr. Halliday.
They are not mine.
I know the will of my daughter.
They belong to that creature there.
No.
I do not want them.
I do not want to make a profit with the death of the Flossie.
Regrettable.
- I think that I can go away.
- Does he think?
He cannot be a murderer, Monsieur Le Comte, but he is a swindler.
The man goes with me even to the Scotland Yard.
Expensive Mr. Poirot:
it would like thanking for him his help in this tragedy.
His logical and professional method it was something that supported me during my deep despair.
I wait that, in a near future, also I manage to find the same inner calm and perhaps to begin again.
I am going to return the house and to the memory of the happiest times.
Perhaps old friends help me living with the past.
Poor person Monsieur Halliday.
In his letter he says that he is going to return to the Australia to plunge into his work and to try to forget.
And it was extremely generous.
Poor man.
Legendagem:
Thor
"10-16...
Gangbangers" on the beach.
Get me backup.
- You were lucky.
- Yeah, right, so were you.
Shut up and sit there.
I've talked to the county about an alternative.
What kind of alternative?
The water program.
Get your butts out of here now!
And you tell them cops, they want to come take him, they'll never make it through my front yard.
Two, three, four, five... come on.
Where you guys going...
surfing?
I got some baby oil for you.
Come here, honey.
I got nice hands.
How you doing?
I like this umbrella.
My mom's going to love it.
Hey, homes, nice radio.
Hey...
Hey, get down, homes.
Homes, this is for you.
Hey, how about a cold beer, Flaco?
I think I'm a little thirsty tonight.
Hey, hey, hey, is this your beer, homes?
I appreciate it, homes.
Hey, Flaco, watch out.
"Balas" again, man.
Let's have some fun.
Hey, "chavalita. "
Move out of the way, "mija. "
"Orale," Memo.
What's up?
My beach, Flaco.
Don't see no signs.
10-16.
Gangbangers on the beach.
Get me backup.
We're going to have to cut those signs down.
Get him!
Get him, man!
Hey, let him go!
You okay?
Oh, Cort.
Miss me, old buddy?
I thought you went to South America.
I heard you needed me;
here I am.
Hey, let me go, man.
Let's go.
Come on.
Move!
This, too?
Anything that can be used as a weapon.
I don't want what's going on at the beach out there happening in here.
What's this?
Ballet?
Shauni, your name's on this.
Eddie is going with me tonight.
- Does he know about this?
- Hey!
Mitch, they need you upstairs, right now.
Be careful with these guys.
Listen, clean up this place.
I got gangbangers.
Come on, come on!
Hey!
Hey, hey!
Get in there!
Cort.
Hey, little lady.
I thought you were in Africa.
South America.
I thought Kuwait.
Well, I get around.
Hey, you got a problem?
Come on, homes.
Get off me.
Hey!
Come on.
Any lip, and you'll be talking out of your armpits.
Yo, you!
Tough guy, come here come here!
How's your first aid these days?
I haven't lost one yet.
See you at the safe...
Don't touch me, man!
They said that you were hurt.
No, I am fine.
I'm fine.
Why don't you just take care of the kid.
I'm no kid, "ese. "
Yeah, right.
You're barker the wonder dog.
Up yours, "payaso. "
You think you're bad, huh?
That dude hit you on land, you'd be dead, "ese. "
You were lucky.
Yeah right, you were the one who was lucky.
Shut up and sit there.
Eddie, come on.
No, no... ow!
I am fine.
Everything okay in here?
Yeah.
Yeah, man, everything's just fine.
Hey, hey, hey, settle down or you'll be here all day!
Come on!
Oh, this is great.
I got budget cuts, pollutants, gang fights...
Hey, Mitch.
Cort!
I know, I know, you probably thought I was in...
Toad Suck Ferry, Arkansas.
Obviously, you had something to do with this.
No way, Jose.
This is all Garner.
Hey, what can I do?
I book 'em.
I put 'em through the system.
Most of them will be out tomorrow.
A few of 'em will do some time... come out twice as bad.
Eddie, what do you say?
Should we book them?
I don't know.
Uh, he's okay.
Eddie, can I take a look at your head, please?
Yeah, sure.
You, get over here.
I'll, uh, get the wagons down here.
Wait a minute, Gar.
Look.
They're just kids, man.
See what can happen when a guy gets hit over the head?
Can I talk to you about this in my office?
Can you stay here and do something right?
Hey.
Why is it that every time you ask to see me in private,
I get the feeling I should have never left Philly?
Sit down for a second, will you?
I may have just stuck my neck out in a real big way.
Yeah?
Yours or ours?
I've been thinking... instead of running these kids through the court process, where they're gonna end up on the streets or...
Or dead.
I've talked to the county about an alternative.
What kind of alternative?
The water program.
"My" water program?
Well, last I heard, it was the county's water program.
What do you say, champ?
Feel like being lured out for a little fun?
Get my old bike out of storage for you, have some food, hit the fights.
Fights?
Yeah.
Boom-Boom" Benitez vs. Harry "The Horse" Callahan.
Oh, man... you know how long it's been since I've been to the fights?
When?
First bout's 7:00 sharp.
Get a move on, Eddie.
Tonight, Eddie is going to the ballet with me.
The what?
Well, um...
well, come on.
Since Cort's in town...
You're not ducking out on me.
Oh, hey, if the ballet's so important...
Oh, come on.
You understand, right?
Oh, yeah, I understand.
When in doubt, bail out.
I mean, that is your motto, isn't it, Mr. John D. Cort?
No, my motto is
"when the going gets tough, the tough get going. "
Actually, she'll miss me like crazy when I'm gone.
Caffeine... where is it?
Hey, what a left Boom-Boom's got, huh?
Yeah.
The man's a weapon.
So what's next?
Re-up...
start saving lives.
- Morning, guys.
- Fellas.
Then, in ten days, when you're current?
Well, it's a big world out there.
Yeah, well, I just hope I get to see some of it one day.
Just start one day soon.
Mitch got the go-ahead to put those kids in the water program.
Aren't I lucky?
Hey, you're living proof these programs do some good.
That's me, the token bad boy.
So why is he the one having all the fun?
'Cause you got Shauni.
When I'm not in the doghouse.
She still loves you.
You guys will kiss and make up and I'll still be king of the one-night stands.
What are you afraid of, Cort?
What's going to catch you if you stop running?
I don't know, Garner.
I don't want to find out.
Morning.
Yeah.
Whoa, you look like...
Yeah, I know...
like something the cat dragged in.
Mitch, Garner told me the news.
What, you're not thrilled?
Thrilled or not, it doesn't matter.
Look, there's something missing here.
- Yeah?
- Yeah.
I'm going to need more manpower.
Sorry.
Everybody's already assigned.
Except for Cort.
Nice guy, Kramer.
Oh, what is that supposed to mean?
Where did you sleep last night?
How do you know I wasn't at my place?
Because I was.
I got nervous.
I called you until 3:00 in the morning, so I went over to your houseboat, and I fell asleep there, but you didn't.
About Cort, you can have him.
Excuse me.
And you can keep him for all I care because every time he comes into town, you end up in trouble.
Watch out, "vato. "
Hey, when you bring your business where I do my business, makes it hard to do business.
Well, I bet your guns make you feel like big "pandilleros," huh?
Hey, you know, you got a big mouth, "ese. "
You better check it 'fore you wreck it.
Why don't you split?
What if I don't feel like it?
It don't matter.
We're out of here.
You better book, punk.
You owe me, cowboy.
I think you're forgetting that this is better than jail.
This will make us even.
All right, all right.
One shot for the history books here.
Say cheese.
You guys are beautiful.
That's what she said.
That's what she said?
I bet.
Come on, come on.
Look who's here.
Oh, man.
All right.
Now, let's move on down the dock.
What we try to do here is introduce kids who otherwise might not get to the beach to the activities, the fun and all the different things...
Hey, homes, what's up?
All right.
Knock it off.
What's the matter with you, man?
What are you waiting for?
Move, move!
Hey, hey!
Move, move...
Hey, hey, hey.
Mike, I don't think, this approach is working, all right?
Not yet, maybe.
Get on!
What are you guys, deaf?
No, they're not deaf.
They're wimps.
Yeah, lots of attitude, but no "ganas," huh?
You know, maybe we ought to forget this boat ride and send them to beauty school.
Hey, hey.
All right, let's move.
Easy.
Easy.
Come on.
Easy, easy.
- Easy.
Come on.
- Hey, hold it.
You're forgetting something, man.
Come on.
Easy.
Everybody on.
Welcome to the water program, boys.
Okay, move a little bit to your left.
Great.
Okay, look this way.
Great.
Great.
Okay, a little bit to the right.
Okay, and look towards me.
Beautiful.
Great.
Okay, you look great.
All right, here we go.
Come on.
Bathrooms are straight ahead.
I don't think he's going to make it.
Good time, huh?
You know, there's no crime in admitting, you're having a good time every once in a while.
Hey, look, man, maybe, uh...
Maybe, sometime, I could help out, huh?
No one helps Memo but Memo, "ese. "
I think you're wrong.
A guy can get hurt talking like that.
Right now, you're the one that's getting hurt.
Memo!
Get your stuff.
You're out of here.
I don't think so.
Hey, nobody cares what you think.
Hey, man, it's this program or it's jail.
Yeah, well, jail's not so bad.
I've done my time.
So have I.
I guarantee you, he's gonna learn a lot better things here than he ever will in there.
Better for what?
Not better for my world.
Maybe he wants to stay.
Do you want to stay?
No, man.
Well, Mike, call Garner.
Hey, guys, come on, let's go, huh?
We got a lot of things to do yet, unless you guys want to be put away, too.
Anything would be better than going back on that boat.
Check out the blond chick.
Do we really have to go down there?
I thought you said we'd be out of here by 3:00.
John D. Cort?
Guilty as charged.
Hey.
Hey.
Mm, I heard you were in Africa.
Well, I was.
What do you say we get together tonight and talk about big game?
Mmm.
I like it.
Hi.
Um...
I know it's late...
Eddie, cool it.
Okay.
Look, I didn't come here to get on you about staying out late.
I just wanted to make sure you got home safe.
And, um, how do you know
I wasn't going to be out all night with Cort?
Because Cort called me.
He's been calling me every half hour.
Why were you the one to take those kids home alone?
I've been out looking for Memo.
I know he had a good time on the "scarab. "
He won't admit it.
He wants to be a part of this program, Shauni.
He's having a great time, but for some reason, he won't open up.
You mean, like you at the Y pool in Philly?
Yeah, like me at the Y pool in Philly.
And then there was that guy.
Denny Curren.
I hated that guy.
He was so hard on me.
Greatest man I've ever known.
Anything I am today, I am because of him.
Well, now it's your turn, Eddie.
Don't let this kid get away from you.
You've got to make this work for him.
You got to make it work for you.
Que paso, vatos?
I suppose you still haven't seen Memo.
Man, are you crazy?
I told you four hours ago that I ain't seen him, and I sure as hell didn't see him in my bed.
So how do we find him?
We don't.
We do.
You are crazy, huh?
No one messes with Memo's "padre. "
He sits on you, you real dead, homes.
Yeah?
We'll see.
I got dibs on the cowboy's watch, eh?
If the old man's here, buy me some time.
I'm busy.
Hey, uh, we just want to talk.
You know what?
Get off my property, man.
Get off my property.
Or what?
You're gonna call the law?
Hey, in this barrio, I "am" the law.
What are you doing here, man?
Hey, come on.
Trying to give you some other options.
I don't need options, "ese. "
I got everything I need.
Well, you have a father.
That's one up on me.
I hope I'm buying you enough time.
I don't know.
When I think about it, when push came to shove the only thing ever holding me back were my own fears.
Now, come on!
Come on.
Cort, it's all right, man.
Come on, come on, that's enough.
All right.
The man says you're afraid.
What, of him?
No.
Afraid of what Memo might learn out there.
What?
How to be a cute little surfer, huh?
How to get a nice tan?
Well, you see any waves around here?
No man, there were no waves where I grew up either.
I didn't even see the ocean till I was 19.
All anyone ever offered me was a 10-by-20 pool with chipped tile, stinking of chlorine.
But you know what?
It was another life, man.
It was another life other than the one that I thought I was stuck in.
Yeah, so Memo gets out there, huh, gets a taste of something.
What happens when he wants more, "ese?"
He gets doors slammed in his face, yeah, because of who he is, because of where he's from.
It doesn't have to be that way.
Don't tell me.
I know...
and I know where he belongs.
Around here, Memo's big time, "ese. "
He gets "respecto," you understand?
Everybody knows who he is, homes.
So what?
So what, in time, he has tattoos all over his arms, knife scars on his chest or, worse yet, he ends up dead.
Is that what you want, "ese?"
Go inside, Memo.
You know what?
You guys get your butts out of here.
Get out of here now!
And you tell them cops, they want to come take him, they'll never make it through my front yard.
Well, that was interesting.
You ever get so mad, you want to put your fist through a wall?
Actually, I feel like I just did.
Hey, listen.
You were great.
No, man, "you" were great.
If it had been me you were recruiting in there,
I would have joined up.
What are we waiting for?
There's this whole new world at the beach, right?
Hey, come on, now.
Go change in the locker room.
Let's go.
Come on.
Hey, you looking fine.
You can say that again.
Come on, come on.
Hustle up.
Surf's up.
"Dio!" These things made for humans?
Hey, nobody said that good, clean fun was going to be easy.
Come on.
Here we go.
Here.
Why don't you use this?
It will help.
Hey, hey, that's my watch.
Run, run!
Hey, hey, hey!
Hey!
Eddie, grab him!
He's got our money!
What... what the hell is wrong with you?
What, are you stupid?
I was getting some spending money.
I ain't talking about the money, man.
I'm talking about you spitting on me.
Oh, you're so tough, aren't you, huh?
Too tough for me, too tough for my water program.
You think you're as tough as your old man, but you ain't tough enough to stand up to him, are you?
Would you be?
No.
No.
You're right.
Here, man, take it.
Take the money.
It's mine.
Tell your old man you stole it.
He's all I got, man.
No.
No, he's not, man.
That's what I'm trying to tell you.
There's other people, there's other ways, man.
Hell, I found one.
I'm not saying mine's the way, but take a chance, man.
Try to find one for yourself.
How?
Let me help you.
Oh, come on, man.
You've been beaten up by...
by boogie boards, bashed by waves.
Holding out your hand shouldn't be too hard for a tough guy like you.
Come on, man, let me help.
Come on.
What's that?
Hey.
It's a course catalog for September.
Oh, my God.
Oh, Cort comes into town, and you get creamed.
At least you're here to take care of me.
Oh...
Mmm.
Maybe I ought to have John D. Cort stick around.
As if he would.
Hey, I don't know.
He might surprise us.
After all, he's been a big hero this week.
He's always been your big hero.
Now, that's not fair.
Come on, I'm not going to turn into a John D. Cort and run out on you.
He envies me.
You know why?
Because I have you.
Mmm.
It's true.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Where do you think you're going?
I am going to get you an ice pack.
Well.
Fine.
Hey, "cuidado por eso!"
Homes... homes...
Watch out!
How's it going out there?
I mean, besides the fact that Eddie looks like an eggplant.
Considering all they've been through?
Great.
Watch it!
Get away from me with that.
We're smashing, homes.
You could call this their farewell voyage.
Whoo!
Oh!
Memo!
Come on!
I want you!
- I want you now!
- Listen.
What's wrong with you?
Come on.
Don't, you're embarrassing me.
You snuck out me.
Let's go home.
Not here, man.
Don't talk back to me!
Come on, dad!
I'm trying to talk to you.
Come home with me right now!
No!
Hey, he's not coming up.
He's got to, man!
He can't swim.
Hey, he can't swim, man.
Oh, man, he's sinking like...
Where is he?
I don't know, man.
Is he all right?
All right, ready?
One, two, three, four, five.
Come on, Pop.
I'll take over now.
Let him be.
Let him be.
...four, five.
Come on, Pop.
One, two, three, four, five.
One, two, three, four, five.
One, two, three, four, five.
One, two, three, four, five.
Come on, Dad.
One, two, three, four...
Pop...
Mi hijo, mi hijo.
"Adios," man.
Later.
Thanks a lot.
See you.
- Take care, homes.
- Yeah.
Well, I'd say it's working.
But is it enough?
Well, let me ask you:
Is anything ever enough?
Maybe.
I...
I don't know.
I just wish that we could keep a guy like Memo around here for more than a week at a time.
I'd be happy if it was for a month.
Well, you know, maybe he, um...
maybe he ought to come with me.
Yeah.
Right.
To the Caribbean?
To sail the South Seas?
I'm serious.
I'm almost settling down.
Ah, let me guess.
The operative word here is "almost," right?
You ever hear of outward bound?
Yeah, yeah.
Isn't that where you take kids to the mountains and they learn about survival?
And about themselves.
I'm going to be running it up near Idyllwild.
It's for kids like Memo...
and for me.
I don't know, though...
a year in one place...
I might get a little twitchy.
I don't know, Cort.
I think there might be some hope for you yet.
Thank you.
Hey, what do you say we jump on the bikes and head downtown.
"Assassin" Argiro versus...
"Slugger" Sanchez?
You got it.
Tempting... very tempting... but I don't think so.
I think I want to spend the evening with my favorite slugger.
Well, I don't blame you.
Hey... hey, I almost forgot.
Let me see here...
Hmm.
Those are for you.
Thanks.
Last week, everything went bananas.
"Dear family, you must be wondering where I went.
I kidnapped Joey, but we'll be back for the wedding.
There was one last thing I had to do before I got married."
Have mercy!
You took him skydiving?
Well, then where is he?
What if something happened to him?
JESSE:
Help!
What will happen next?
Even I don't know.
JESSE:
Hey!
Help!
Help me!
Hey, you with the tomato truck!
Stop!
I'm up in the tree!
Up here!
Hey, what you doing up there, fella?
JESSE:
Oh, just enjoying the view.
What do you think I'm doing?
Could you help me down, please?
Well, yeah.
Sure.
I'll tell you what, I'll go get Old Man Hudson's cherry picker.
All right, well, hurry up.
I was supposed to be at my wedding 10 minutes ago.
Thanks.
Well, I imagine we'll have you down in two, three hours tops.
- Now, don't you go anywhere.
JESSE:
What?
I can't wait that long.
Mercy!
What are you doing?
Those are my prize tomatoes you just squashed.
Well, they're not tomatoes anymore, they're ketchup.
I just cut out the middleman.
Is that some sort of tomato joke?
You better watch your mouth.
This here is tomato country.
I have nothing but the highest regard for tomatoes and the men and women that do grow them.
But I need a ride to San Francisco right now.
I don't give rides to tomato-squashers.
This is my life we're talking about, not some vegetable.
- It's a fruit.
- Fruit, vegetable--
Look, the point is I like you, Red.
And I like tomatoes a lot, believe me.
And I like your red hair.
You know what?
I like your truck, and I'm gonna borrow it.
- I'll get it right back to you.
- You get back here.
Open that door!
Hey!
Hey!
Hey-
- Hold it.
Cousin Harold!
Cousin Harold, that boy just smashed every one of my tomatoes.
- Smashed your tomatoes?
- He's trespassing.
Now he's trying to steal my truck.
Get out of that truck with your hands up.
Now!
[CHUCKLING]
Hi, guys.
Listen, you guys are making a big mistake here.
Look, I'm just late for my wedding.
Look at this.
I got my tuxedo on and everything.
Well, here is a bracelet to go with it.
Wait a minute, guys.
Guys, you're making a big mistake here.
No, you made the mistake.
Do you know where you landed?
Tomato country?
[MURMURING]
The Making of a Wedding, the saga continues.
The groom is now 25 minutes late.
Here's the man who let him jump out of a plane on his wedding day:
Joey Gladstone.
Joey, how do you feel right now?
Sad, hurt, angry, bitter, scared, used and I'm pretty hungry.
I forgot to eat breakfast.
Poor Joey.
Breakfast is the most important meal of the day.
And here's Becky with her loving family.
Any words for Uncle Jesse?
Darling, I just hope you're all right.
But if you are all right, I'll kill you.
Daddy, where's Uncle Jesse?
Hold on, please.
Honey, I'm trying to find out.
When are you going to find out?
When I find out, Howie.
- Did you find out yet?
- Kids, if you don't stop this I'm gonna turn this wedding around and drive right home.
Daddy, you need a nap.
Yeah, please call me if you hear anything.
Yes, sir, and I'll try to squeeze in that nap.
Thank you.
Daddy, is it time for the wedding cake?
Michelle, we can't have cake until we have a party and we can't have a party until we have a wedding.
Howie, will you marry me?
- Why?
- So we could eat wedding cake.
Is it chocolate cake?
Who cares?
It's this big and it's got frosting.
[PHONE RINGS]
Hello?
It's Jesse.
Jesse, tell me--
Let me talk to him.
Are you okay?
He's okay.
What?
Well, stay right where you are.
Danny, Joey, don't let any of the guests leave.
I'm coming back, and we're gonna have a wedding.
Dad, I need your car keys and your wallet now!
- But, honey--
- She said now!
- Yes, dear.
- Becky, where you going?
To tomato country to bail my groom out of jail.
She better hurry.
She's gonna miss the wedding.
[MURMURING]
This crowd is getting restless.
You guys better lock the exits.
- We have to tell these people something.
- We can't tell them the truth.
- Well, I can't lie in church.
- Well, neither can I.
We'll take them out to the parking lot, and we'll lie to them there.
That is a dumb idea.
- What's up?
- Where's my baby?
Oh.
Um, well, the truth is, your son--
Would everybody like to accompany me to the parking lot?
I know why Jesse's late!
He's in the slammer!
You can all sit down now.
You gotta let me out of here.
I'm getting married right now.
Why don't you believe me?
Because nobody jumps out of a plane on their wedding day.
- Jesse.
- Told you.
Hi, honey.
Hello, darling.
You look mad.
Are you mad?
Uh-huh.
Oh, you're so cute when you're mad.
And right now, you're about the cutest I've ever seen you.
Jess, are you insane?
How could you do this on our wedding day?
Actually, this is really funny.
You're gonna laugh.
Maybe you won't laugh.
No, you're not gonna laugh.
I had this long talk with your dad and he talked to me about settling down and being responsible.
I just had to go out and get this one last adventure.
What do you mean "one last adventure"?
Jess, the adventure is just beginning for both of us, sharing our lives and having a family.
If you wanna jump out of a plane, let me know.
I'll strap on a chute.
I'll be right there next to you.
The point is, whatever the adventure, let's just do it together.
Darling, you're the best.
This is beautiful.
I'm dropping all the charges.
- Really?
You're gonna let me out?
- Yeah, I am.
It's Valentine's Day.
There you go.
Just call me Cupid.
Everybody's waiting.
We can still make it.
- Let's go.
- Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute.
- Got a little wedding present for you.
- I don't really like toma--
She loves tomatoes.
They're her favorite fruit.
I thought they were a vegetable.
Let's go get married.
Thank you.
Nice kids.
BECKY:
Hey!
- Wait!
- Hold on!
My father's car!
- We gotta get to our wedding!
- You can't do this to me!
I'm a bride!
And I'm a groom!
Hey!
Hey!
Oh, I'm never gonna catch that tow truck in these heels.
- There's a bus.
- Stop that bus!
- Stop!
Stop!
- Stop!
Stop!
Stop!
JESSE:
All right.
- Oh, great.
Thanks.
- Hi.
DRIVER:
Hi.
We need a ride to San Francisco.
- Sorry, we're really not going that way.
- But my wedding!
We're late!
He jumped out of a plane, jail, my father's car!
I hate tomatoes!
Wait a minute.
Aren't you on Wake Up, San Francisco?
Yes, I am.
Hi, I'm Rebecca Donaldson, and this is my fiancé, Jesse Katsopolis.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Well, hop on.
- Oh, great!
Thank you!
- Oh, thank you!
Thanks.
- We appreciate this.
- Hello.
Hi.
Okay, now, you go out to the highway, you turn left, then--
Why don't I just drive?
- Hey, it's your wedding day.
- Great.
Becky, you're gonna drive the bus?
Hey, you had your adventure, now I'm gonna have mine.
- Hi.
Hi, everybody.
- Hi.
JESSE:
Hit it.
[SINGING] You say potato
You say potato
You say tomato
You say tomato
- Potato
- Potato
- Tomato

Let's call the whole thing off
Okay, everybody.
First, the bride's side.
You say pajamas
You say pajamas
You say Bahamas
You say Bahamas
[HALLELUJAH CHORUS SINGING]
JESSE:
All right!
Too much.
Whoo-hoo!
- Thank you.
Come on, let's go.
BECKY:
Thank you.
- Thank you.
Whoo!
- Let's go.
We can still make it.
- Bahamas, Bahamas
- Stop the music!
Stop the music!
- Let's call the whole thing--
- Stop the music!
Stop the music!
Uncle Jesse is here.
Are you sure, Michelle?
I know what he looks like.
He's my uncle.
Uncle Jesse and Rebecca are back.
We're gonna have the wedding.
GUESTS:
All right!
MAN:
This is great!
I just said that.
Maybe when I'm 5 people will listen.
Hi, everyone.
Sorry I'm late.
Hi.
Hi.
Sorry, I'm late.
I was caught in a tree.
Actually, I was caught in a tree.
Nice suit.
Hi, Mom, Dad.
- Oh, honey.
- It's nice to see you.
Hey, Fath-
- Whoa.
And hit it.
[PLAYING CLASSICAL MUSIC]
Stop the wedding!
Michelle, what's the matter, honey?
I ran out of flowers.
I'm sorry.
Sweetheart, it's not your fault you ran out of flowers.
The problem is the church, it's much too long.
Wasn't she terrific, everybody?
I did the best I could.
[PLAYING BRIDAL CHORUS]
Who gives this woman to this man?
Her mother and I do.
Dad, let go.
Sorry, baby.
Dearly beloved we've waited a long time for this happy occasion.
A very long time.
May I have the rings, please?
Thank you.
Thank you, and thank you.
- You're welcome.
- And you're welcome.
Jesse, place this ring on Rebecca's finger and say, "With this ring, I thee wed."
With this ring, I thee wed.
Now, Rebecca, you place this ring on Jesse's finger and say, "With this ring, I thee wed."
With this ring, I thee wed.
At this time, Jesse would like to pledge his love for Rebecca with music.
[SINGING] If every word I said
Could make you laugh
I'd talk forever
I'd ask the sky just what we had
It showed forever
If the song I sing to you
Could fill your heart with joy
I'd sing forever
Forever
Forever
I've been so happy loving you
Baby, let me sing forever
I wanna be loved forever
Baby, let me sing forever
I wanna be loved forever
If every word I said
Could make you laugh
I'd talk forever
Together in love
Forever
Forever
I've been so happy loving you
- Let the love I have for you
- Let the love I have for you
- Live in your heart and be forever
- Live in your heart and be forever
Forever
Forever
I'll be so happy loving you
May your life be filled with harmony forever.
Rebecca, do you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband to love and to cherish for as long as you both shall live?
I do.
Jesse, do you take this woman to be your lawfully wedded wife to love and to cherish for as long as you both shall live?
I do.
I now pronounce you husband and wife.
You may now go on kissing the bride.
I now present Mr. and Mrs. Katsopolis.
[HALLELUJAH CHORUS SINGING]
Excuse me.
Excuse me.
Hi.
Groom was late, lost the hall.
Have a coaster.
- Hey, you.
- Just looking.
Yeah, just looking for a good spot to dive in.
Try some pâté.
Well, what do you think?
Excuse me, I have to go spit.
- A toast.
- A toast to the bride.
One of the joys of friendship is the happiness you feel when you know how happy your friends are.
We all know how happy Jesse and Becky are.
And seeing those two wacky nuts so happy....
Danny, take it.
I'm too happy.
Joey, you big softy.
You know as I look at all you happy, smiling people with your glasses raised I can't help but think there are so many of you and so few coasters to go around.
- So share those coasters.
- While we're young!
Danny, come on!
[GUESTS CHATTERING]
Oh, there's a lot of love in this room.
To Jesse and Rebecca.
May you have a wonderful life together.
I love you guys.
- Thank you.
- To Jesse and Rebecca.
- Thank you, everybody.
- Attention, everyone.
Attention.
It's time for the first dance by the bride and the groom my Uncle Jesse and my new Aunt Becky.
Okay, people.
Move it, move it, move it.
Move it or lose it.
Come on, these people have to have room to dance now.
Come on.
Okay, come on.
Hurry it up.
I don't know how long I can hold these people.
All right, well, as our wedding song naturally I wanted my favorite song, "Jailhouse Rock."
But I wanted a romantic ballad.
Right.
So as a first of very many, many, many, compromises as husband and wife, we came up with a little thing that goes something like this.
I hope you all enjoy it.
[SINGING SLOW VERSION OF "JAILHOUSE ROCK"]
Oh, that's sweet.
Now, let's rock!

Seasons greetings, everybody, from K-Bear, the heart and soul of Cicely, Alaska.
This is Chris in the Morning.
From where I'm sitting,
I got a great view of all the yuletide decorations going up all over town.
That's right.
Everywhere I turn my head, I see ebony birds roosting for the holidays.
You know, twinkling, colored lights are nice, and so are plastic Santas and reindeers and manger scenes.
But, tell you something, friends- nothing like the sight of a beautiful, black-as-pitch raven to get you in the Christmas spirit.
Oh, hey, that reminds me.
Congratulations to our own Marilyn Whirlwind, who's landed the part of the Princess Susitna in this year's raven pageant.
Break a wing, Marilyn.
Whoops.
I There stumbles Maggie O'Connell in her usual Christmas mode.
She gets a little accident-prone this time of year, so it's best for your own safety, keep a wide berth.
Hey, this one's for everybody out there.
I understand the suicide rate goes up dramatically around Christmas time.
Yeah, well, you know, it's a stressful time of the year for most people, Maurice.
Yeah.
The thing is, you go through the rest of the year fine.
You've got your friends, you've got your business, you're part of the community.
And then, round the middle of December, if you're alone, you start to feel like an outsider.
Well, you feel alienated.
Here, this is for you - top of your Christmas tree.
Thanks.
You know, it's the nature of a family holiday... to make a single man feel disenfranchised.
You're made to feel like a hungry vagrant... with your nose pressed up against a window- staring at somebody else's dinner.
Maurice, there's some people here to see you.
People?
What the hell do they want?
Here, have a raven.
Thanks.
I'm Minnifield.
Hello.
I'm Yung Bong Joo.
This is my dad, Yung Duk Won.
And my grandmom, Yung Yong Ja.
We're very happy to meet you.
Likewise, I'm sure.
Who are you?
- He's my dad.
- Yeah, I got that part.
And your son.

- Hey, Ed.
Dave.
- Hi.
- Hello, Dr. Fleischman.
- Christmas tree, huh?
- Uh-huh.
Good choice.
Full base.
Tapering off nicely at the top.
You know, a lot of people go for the Douglas fir, but I'm a spruce man too.
- Watch your end, Dave.
- Okay.
What a smell.
You know, a Christmas tree is wonderful in and of itself, but it evokes so much.
It's images of snowmen, sleigh rides.
- You want us to cut you one?
- Me?
- Uh-huh.
- Guys, I'm Jewish.
So?
Well, I mean, a Christmas tree's a major Christian symbol.
Next to the cross itself, you can't get anything that's more Christian than that.
You know what I mean?
Traditionally, Jews try to avoid Christian symbols.
Oh, well, you know, Dave's an animist, and he has a Christmas tree, right, Dave?
- Right.
- Ah, yes.
But Dave wasn't raised by Herb and Nadine Fleischman.
Herb and Nadine Fleischman, who would rather be flayed alive... than allow so much as a candy cane, let alone a full-blown Christmas tree, into their home.
Coming through.
Not that I haven't fantasized about having a tree.
- Watch it here.
- Hold on.
Hold on.
Hey, Lou, you still owe me.
As a kid, our kitchen window faced the living room of this Irish family, the McGoverns.
I used to watch them decorate their tree.
They'd string popcorn, drape tinsel.
Like a Hallmark card.
I mean, this lovely tableau.
Christmas music on the radio.
So warm.
So inviting.
Watch it.
Actually, you know, I've always liked Christmas.
It's a great holiday for a Jewish kid.
I mean, two weeks off from school and nothing expected of you.
Right here, Ed.
And it's true that I've enjoyed and even embraced other trappings of the holiday season.
The music, the gift-giving.
You don't have to be Republican to celebrate Lincoln's birthday.
So, when you think about it,
I'm, uh
- I'm probably splitting hairs in denying myself a tree, right?
- Right.
- So, you want one?
Huh.
Let me think about it.
Hey, Fleischman, I got your plaster bandages.
Oh, hey.
Easy.
You all right?
Why do you put yourself through this?
There's an easier way to get out of it.
Put myself through what?
Come on.
Everyone knows you hate going home for Christmas.
So?
So, don't break your neck.
Just tell your parents you're busy.
First of all, Fleischman, my clumsiness is not part of a subconscious agenda.
- And secondly, tell my parents I'm too busy?
- Yeah.
Fleischman, that is one of your more brainless ideas.
It's Christmas, Fleischman.
Christmas.
You're not too busy.
Hey, go easy on yourself.
I don't wanna have to use these on you.
- You like the glasses?
- They're cool.
They're hand painted...
from Czechoslovakia.
Look at the details.
You can see every feather.
They're really neat.
What's wrong, hon?
I don't know, Holling.
You seem a little down.
I was watching this Christmas special on TV.
You know that really fat Italian singer... and this little boys' choir in this big ol' cathedral.
Yeah?
Well, it was like I could smell the incense, you know?
Like I was back at Our Lady of Refuge.
Christmas Eve, they always had a midnight Mass.
And just before 12:00, they used to turn off all the lights.
Then the organ would start to play, and the doors would open, and the choir would come down the aisles carrying candles.
Then the altar boys.
Then Father Perone.
They'd all be singing.
I love the ravens, Holling.
I really do.
But it just doesn't feel like... an old-fashioned, Charlie Brown Christmas.
Hi, Grandpa.
Everything checks out.
Letters, documents, blood tests.
I acknowledge he's my son.
I was very young in Korea.
I was 16.
I forged my father's signature so I could get in the Marine Corps.
I was a boy in a man's body.
I did some foolish things.
Never mind.
What-What do they want?
Ask her what she wants.
- Pork chops.
- No.
Not to eat.
What do you want?
How much do you want from me?
Money.
Dinero.
Money.
No, no, no.
No.
No dollar.
- No.
No dollar.
No, no, no.
- Money, no.
No money.
- No?
- No.
No, no dollar.
- You don't want money?
- No dollar.
Then what are you doing here?
What-What are they doing here?
- My dad just want to meet you.
- That's it?
That's all?
You just wanna meet me?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
How do?
Pleased to meet you.
Excuse me, Grandpa.
Now, just so we understand each other,
I want you to know that I live up to my obligations.
But I also protect my interests.
If you intend to take me to court, bear in mind that I have a team of lawyers who will eat you for lunch.
That being said, enjoy your stay.
Kids look at holidays materialistically.
I always thought that Hanukkah was a better deal.
I mean, you get eight presents, right?
They're staggered over a week.
You're forced to savor each one.
Careful, Bong.
With Christmas, you get everything all at once.
It's easy to overload.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- We got it.
We got it.
We got it.
There was only one year I envied my neighbor.
Tom McGovern.
He got this autographed Bobby Mercer baseball glove.
God, I loved that glove.
Whoa!
Whoa!
All right.
Whoa.
Okay.
Go ahead.
Boy, it's shedding all over the place.
Yep.
Trees'll do that.
You might put a sheet under it.
Where would you like this, Dr. Fleischman?
Uh, well, over by the fireplace.
- That's an appropriate place, right?
- Yeah.
Not too close though.
Okay.
All righty.
- On three.
One, two, three.
- All right.
- Wow.
It's big.
- Yeah.
- It's immense.
- Looks good.
- Well, see you later, Dr. Fleischman.
- Wait, wait.
Where are you going?
Bong wants to check out the new sinkhole over by the Kinuk fault.
Yeah.
Hey, it's not going anywhere for a few millennia.
Stick around.
I got sodas and crackers, ice cream and...
No, thanks, Dr Fleischman.
Wait a sec.
What about the tree?
I mean, what do I do?
- Oh.
Decorate it.
- Bye.
Uh, excuse me.
I'm afraid I owe you an apology.
Your dress got in the hamper.
I didn't see it.
Yeah.
It got in the wash with my cords.
They bleed a little bit.
No, I'll buy you another one.
No, no.
Now, these things cost a pretty penny, and I insist on buying you another one.
No.
Now, I insist.
All right.
That's settled.
Uh, ma'am?
Gosh, how do I say this?
Uh-
Clearly, we-you and I- had an intimate relationship.
But I don't remember you.
For the life of me, I can't remember a thing about you.
Don't be offended.
I had a lot of relationships with women in those days.
I was young, unattached, in a strange country.
Maybe you could jog my memory.
There was a place that I used to frequent in Seoul.
There was a gal who worked there named, um,
Kika.
Kika?
Kija?
Kija.
Kija?
Yeah.
Yeah.
She was short and had black hair.
Kija.
Yeah.
Yeah.
She was a particular favorite of my friend Scooter Wilson.
- Michael...
Wilson.
- Mike Wilson.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's Scooter.
Now we're gettin' somewhere.
A
- Are you Kija?
Kija?
Yeah.
No.
Ma'am, I didn't wanna say anything in front of the kids, but, if you have any hopes of renewing our relationship in any significant way, that's impossible.
A lot of water's gone under the bridge.
We've gone our separate ways.
Well, if you think about it in the cold light of day, rationally, you'll see that you'd be happier with someone of your own persuasion.
I'm glad we had this chat.
Straightened things out.
Okay, let me get something straight.
The fact that I have you in my living room is meaningless.
I'm not betraying anything.
You're a tree.
Flora, a plant-a nonsentient being.
That's all.
I mean, I know there are people who like to endow you with religious significance, but even at that you're really more of a cultural symbol... like, uh, the Easter bunny, Uncle Sam, Tony the Tiger.
You're something fun.
Something for everybody to enjoy.
Buddhists, Muslims, Rastafarians-
Fleischman?
- What?
It's open.
- I think I've hurt my ankle.
- What happened?
- Oh, I slipped and fell off the porch.
- Could you take a look at it?
- Yeah, sure.
Good.
Ow!
Oh.
Watch it, O'Connell.
You're gonna wreck the furniture.
You're not just a menace to yourself.
You're a menace to others as well.
- Sorry.
- All righty, which one?
This left one here.
- Okay.
Easy, easy.
- Nice tree.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Just that.
Nice tree.
Don't be coy with me, O'Connell.
Go ahead, say it.
What?
I'm Jewish.
What am I doing with a Christmas tree?
It's inappropriate, right?
I
- I should have a mezuzah, or menorah, both of which, by the way, I do have, and I display proudly for all the goyim to see.
- But, God forbid, a Christmas tree.
- Fleischman, what is your problem?
I'm not the one with a problem.
I'm not the one who, every Christmas, indulges in an orgy of self-destruction.
Well, if you had to face what I face, you wouldn't want to go home either.
All right, I can take a X-ray, but I'm pretty sure this is just a sprain.
- Now, tell me what could be so terrible.
- My mother, for starters.
I mean, from the minute I walk in the door, it's, "When are you gonna get married?
When am I gonna have grandchildren?"
And my father who, of course, agrees with her, tells her to be quiet, and they just start fighting.
And my brother, the iceberg, who thinks any display of emotion is in poor taste, he just retreats to his room and fondles his old swim team trophies.
Well, there has to be something nice about going home.
I mean, sitting around a tree, opening presents.
Oh, the presents.
The presents are the worse part.
I get all these froufrou outfits that I wouldn't wear in a million years.
Come on, O'Connell.
These are your parents.
They raised you.
They love you.
- They're doing the best they can do.
- I know that.
I mean, of course I know that.
Don't you think I know that?
That's what makes it so awful.
I'm a horrible, ungrateful child for even having such thoughts.
It's hopeless.
Tomorrow it'll be waiting at Ruth-Anne's.
A letter from my parents with a round-trip ticket.
I can't begin to describe to you the sense of dread I feel... at the thought of opening that envelope.
There's no escape.
- Stay off the ankle.
- Good night, Fleischman.
Thanks for nothing.
Attention, Cicelians.
Only two shopping days left till Christmas.
Hey, I see the Minnifields out for a family stroll.
How nice.
Merry Christmas.
everybody.
This just in from the Cicely Choral Society.
All members are requested to gather at Mel's Guns and Ammo... 7:00 tonight for caroling.
Please remember to dress warm.
Also, a reminder to anybody attending tomorrow night's raven pageant.
You're welcome to take pictures, but, please, no flash equipment.
It's hazardous to the performers.
Okay.
Here's one for Maurice.
- Mmm.
What smells so good, Ruth-Anne?
- Raven bread.
- I make it every Christmas.
Try some.
- Okay.
Mmm, pumpernickel.
I'll take a loaf.
Listen, I need some of these Christmas tree decorations.
Ornaments, tinsel, the usual.
Well, we have some raven lights, and, um, raven ornaments.
Do you have anything else, you know, besides Heckle and Jeckle?
- I mean, what do you put on your tree?
- I don't have a tree, Joel.
- No?
- It pains me.
The very thought of chopping down a healthy, living thing... and displaying it in my living room until there's nothing left except... a brittled, withered shell of its former self.
Well, what about the fake kind?
To tell you the truth, Joel, I happen to be an atheist.
- Huh, you're an atheist?
No kidding.
- Uh-huh.
I always admired atheists.
I think it takes a lot of faith.
I mean, you know, conviction to deny the existence of a supreme being.
Oh, I believe in a supreme being.
I
- I just don't think that she takes human form.
- Interesting, Ruth-Anne.
- Okay, Ruth-Anne.
Let's get it over with.
Here's your letter, dear.
- That's 11.95, Joel.
- They're going to St. Thomas.
Let me take a look at that, O'Connell.
"We hope you forgive us, "but the Morrisons offered us their time-share, and Daddy really needs the vacation.
- Maybe we'll get together at Easter. "
- Congratulations.
You don't have to go home now.
Yeah, O'Connell.
You can stop abusing yourself.
- What's the matter?
- Oh, nothing.
I'm just, um-
- What?
- I-I don't know.
I'm just-
- Surprised?
- Yes.
Well, no.
No, no.
I'm just so-
- Relieved?
- Yes.
Relieved.
Relieved and-
- Happy?
- Right.
I'm relieved and happy and surprised.
I mean, what a fantastic relief.
What a happy surprise.
I'm just so- so
- So.
- Excuse me.
Uh, could we turn that down?
- Sure.
Oh, no, no, no.
No, thank you.
No, I'm fine.
Oh, yeah.
D
- Da
- Dad?
Look, I-I don't have a clue here.
Bong, what's he saying?
- Dad say he's happy you're his dad.
- Oh, well, that's
- That's fine.
What?
Music.
Music.
Here is my gift for Baby Jesus.
Chris, are you planning on some kind of special service for Christmas this year?
No.
Nothing special.
I mean,
I thought I'd have a post-raven question-and- answer with some of the pageant participants.
What?
I was thinking of something a little more traditional.
Yeah, well-yeah, we could sing some Christmas songs, Holling.
Well, something more along the lines of a Mass.
Shelly's Catholic.
She misses her Christmas Mass.
Oh, yeah.
Well, you know, that's some serious codified ritual, Holling.
- You know, that's way out of my league, man.
- You know a little Latin, don't you?
In vino veritas.
Tempus fugit.
That kind of stuff.
Oh, hey, I got a Latin copy of the Aeneid laying around somewhere.
You know, I could read Shelly a couple of lines from that.
No, I don't think that'd do it.
But thanks anyway, Chris.
- Hi, Shelly.
- Hey, Maggie.
Congratulations.
I heard you aren't going home.
Oh, yeah.
It's great.
It's an incredible relief.
- Dave made eggnog.
- Oh, wonderful.
You know, I really look forward to Christmas Eve... 'cause it'll be the first time in my life I get to spend it entirely alone.
There'll be nobody bothering me, placing demands on me, expectations.
- It'll just be quiet and peaceful.
- Holy.
Hmm, that's an interesting way of looking at it.
I mean, I don't have to deal with my mother or my brother.
Our Father.
Oh, well, my father.
He's impossible at Christmas.
- There's just no talking to him.
No...
- Communion.
Exactly.
You know, when my parents told me they weren't going to have Christmas, in a way that was the best gift they could have given me.
Maggie, uh, you've never met my parents before.
They're just in from Barrow.
Mom, Dad, this is Maggie O'Connell.
Oh, man.
Maurice, I tell you.
I hear those carolers, you know, all those human voices ascending up to heaven in a harmonic pyramid of sound.
I get very zoned.
I get very light in my galoshes, you know?
Does that happen to you?
- Uh-uh.
- No?
- Hey, uh, where's the Kinder at?
- At the house.
Ah.
At my house, which no longer feels like my house.
I had to get out and get some fresh air.
Hear some English.
- Yeah, well.
- You know, Chris, all my life I've dreamed of having a son.
A little towheaded tyke I could bounce on my knee, teach to ride, hunt, fish.
- Yeah, a little mini Maurice, right?
- Yeah, and what do I get?
A middle-aged Chinaman.
- I thought Duk Won's Korean.
- It's all the same difference.
Well, Maurice, a lot to be said for having grown kids.
You know, they're out of the house.
You don't have to worry about... car insurance, you know, tuition.
It's not the age, Chris.
I could handle that.
Hell, I can handle anything.
Physical impairment, low I.Q. I could handle that.
I could even handle if he was a bookworm.
I'd find some way to accept him.
But, if he was only-
White?
Yeah.
White.
I understand this thing about you and your brother Bernard... and your decision to be a person of color.
I even respect it.
Hell, everybody's got a right to make their own mistakes.
But this- this is my own flesh and blood.
This cuts a little close to the bone.
You know what I mean?
- It's the other.
- Other what?
Maurice, think of concentric circles.
The inner circle is ourselves, then the family, then the tribe, then the neighboring tribe, so on and so on.
The further you get away from the center, the more foreign things become.
The people in the outer circles, they become the "other."
- What's your point?
- Well, with sex, the other's good.
I mean, you were probably very attracted to Duk Won's mother way back when.
But, you take the other from the outer and make it part of the inner, sometimes it doesn't work out.
Chris, no matter how you explain this thing, it's a nightmare.
This man is my son.
I don't like the way he looks.
I don't like the way he talks.
I don't like what he eats.
Well, if it's any consolation, Maurice, you know, your feelings aren't instinctual.
- No?
- No.
It's cultural.
Well, how the hell could that be a consolation?
- It's learned behavior.
- So?
So, you can unlearn it.
- Hi, Marilyn.
On your way to rehearsal?
- Run-through.
You nervous?
About performing in front of people?
- No.
- You know, Marilyn,
I'm familiar with parts of the New Testament.
I also know about the winter solstice tie-in.
Well, this might seem like a shocking display of ignorance, but I seem to be the only one in town who doesn't know.
I mean, what exactly is this thing with the raven?
Thing?
Well, I don't understand what it has to do with Christmas.
A long time ago, the raven looked down from the sky... and saw that the people of the world were living in darkness.
The ball of light was kept hidden by a selfish, old chief.
So, the raven turned himself into a spruce needle... and floated on the river where the chief's daughter came for water.
She drank the spruce needle.
She became pregnant and gave birth to a boy, which was the raven in disguise.
The baby cried and cried until the chief gave him the ball of light to play with.
As soon as he had the light, the raven turned back into himself and carried the light into the sky.
From then on, we no longer lived in darkness.
Wow, that's a great story.
- Hello, Dad. - Maurice.
- Hi, Grandpop.
Yeah.
Uh, I just came in for some coffee.
- Uh, no- No.
No tea.
Thank you.
Uh, no, no.
I'll just-
Would you tell her that I've got some desk work that I've got to clean up.
So, I'll just take this and go in there.
Um, Grandpop?
Dad wants to know if you'd like to go on a hike with him.
Hike?
- Up the mountains.
- Oh, uh, yeah.
Yeah.
I'd like to take a hike, but I don't think I'm gonna have time today.
Excuse me.
It's open.
Grandma wants to talk to you.
- Grandmom say you're not happy.
- No, no.
I'm just-
- She said let her finish.
- All right.
All these years, Grandma was afraid to tell you that you had a son.
She knew it would be a big shock.
Grandmom didn't want to come here.
But my daddy said it's time to meet his father.
It was a mistake.
She's sorry we came.
"Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore-
"Tell me what thy lordly name is on the night's Plutonian shore.
Quoth the raven, 'Nevermore. "'
Well, that's how Mr. Poe saw the raven.
You know, lots of references in Western literature do tend toward the negative.
Like most things in life, when it comes to transcendental symbols, one man's savior is another man's pair of lead boots.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
You're very welcome.
Listen, Duk, your mom is upset with me.
There's probably some justification for it.
I mean, I sometimes give the impression that, uh,
I'm a little bit insensitive.
But I never meant to hurt her feelings.
I don't know how much of this is getting through the static, but I'm gonna be straight with you.
You are not the son that I bargained for.
Not by a long shot.
But, you are my progeny.
I am your father.
- Father?
- Yeah.
Yeah, father.
So, I think we should make a good-faith effort to understand each other, get to know each other a little bit.
Uh, anyway, cheers.
Yeah.
You like sour mash, huh?
Uh, Dave, bring Duk here another round.
Coming up.
Pretty good there.
So, uh, what do you, uh- what do you do?
- Do?
- Do.
You know, job?
Work?
Do for a living?
Okay, look.
Truck driver?
No.
Musician?
How about barber?
Haircut?
Okay, look.
Me.
Me.
Astronaut.
Astronaut.
- Yeah, yeah.
Right.
- Astronaut.
Yeah, that's right.
Now, you.
Gisa.
Gisa.
Gisa.
No.
I don't understand.
Yeah, sure.
Uh-huh.
That's a diode.
- A capacitor.
- Capacitor.
Yeah.
Capacitor.
- Yeah.
Let me see that.
- Thank you.
- No problem.
- A transistor.
This is a circuit.
Cir
- Circuit.
Yeah, circuit.
Yeah.
- You're an engineer.
- Engineer.
Gisa.
An electrical engineer.
Hey.
Hey, guys.
He's an engineer.
You know, I know my way around a slide rule pretty well too.
- That's all right.
An engineer, huh?
- Engineer.
Yeah.
Well, cheers.
You're no- You're no wimp, are you?
Strong too.
Yeah.
You, uh-you lift?
Uh, pump iron.
- "Ahnulda"?
- Arnold.
Movie.
Movie.
Arnold.
Oh, Arnold.
Yeah, Arnold.
Okay.
- One.
- Uh
- Two.
- Two.
Three.
No, no.
It's fine.
Hey, that's not bad.
Now, wait here.
We're gonna do this right.
Is this great?
I got some chestnuts.
I can put 'em in the oven.
- What?
- Well, where are the lights?
Right here.
Fleischman, you gotta put the lights on before the ornaments.
Aha!
See, that's why I brought you here.
I needed an expert.
You're gonna have to take all the ornaments off.
Okay.
No problem.
We can do that.
See, what you do is you string the lights.
But test them first to see if they work.
Then you put the little ornaments at the top and you work your way down, and you put the heavier, bigger ornaments on the lower branches.
See?
I'm enjoying this already.
And then, people put tinsel, but I usually don't.
- Yeah, me neither.
It's-
- Tacky.
- My sentiments exactly.
- Okay.
Well, look, Fleischman, you know, it's really easy decorating a Christmas tree.
- It's common sense.
- You don't need me.
So, um, I'll see you later.
Wait a minute.
Where are you going?
- Well, I-I have to get things organized.
- Things?
What things?
- Well, my taxes, for one.
- Your taxes?
O'Connell, it's Christmas Eve.
They're not due till April.
Come on.
I'm gonna string some popcorn.
Mull some wine.
I'm really not in the mood.
"I, said the cow, all white and red.
I gave him my manger for his bed."
"I gave him my hay to pillow his head."
"I, said the cow, all white and red."
"So every beast by some good spell in the stable dark was glad to tell..."
"of the gift he gave Immanuel."
"The gift he gave Immanuel."
It's an old legend that on Christmas Eve at midnight, all the animals fall to their knees and speak, praising the newborn Jesus.
Back in the winter of'69, my dad was serving a short time for a D.U.I., and I don't know where my mom was.
Anyway, I was home alone Christmas Eve, and I stayed up extra kind of late to see if my dog Buddy would talk.
And he did.
I don't remember his exact words, but that's not important.
What matters is that a seven-year-old boy... experienced his own personal epiphany.
What's my point?
Well, it's that Christmas reveals itself to us each in a personal way, be it secular or sacred.
Whatever Christmas is, and it's many things to many people, we all own a piece of it.
It's like-Well, it's kind of like Santa's bag.
Inside there's a gift for everybody.
My Christmas wish for you tonight?
May your dog talk.
Good night, Cicely.
Merry Christmas.
- Dave, where's Holling?
- He said he had an errand to run.
Well, I'm gonna stop by church, so tell him I'll meet him at the pageant.
Okay.
Just a second.
- Hey, O'Connell.
- Hey, Fleischman.
What, you're not going to the raven pageant?
You know, I tried.
I really did.
I gave it my best shot.
It just didn't work.
Scratch the plum pudding, there's a matzo ball underneath.
- I'm a Jew.
That's all there is to it.
- What are you talking about?
I have something that I think belongs to you.
Close your eyes.
Come on.
Just close 'em.
- Step out here.
Oh, come on.
- Fleischman.
Come on.
Just close your eyes one sec.
One sec, that's all.
Hold on.
Hold on.
All righty.
One sec.
Keep 'em closed.
Open 'em.
Wow.
Merry Christmas, O'Connell.
- Thanks, Fleischman.
- Yeah.
Belongs here.
Excuse me.
I didn't mean to intrude.
Listen, uh,
I just wanna tell you that you did a good job.
It couldn't have been easy without a husband-without a father figure.
But you should be very proud.
Duk Won, he's a fine man.
Yeah.
Yeah.
He's smart.
And strong.
Very, very strong.
Say that again.
You.
That's "strong and big."
Yeah.
That's what you used to call me.
I remember now.
You had beautiful, long hair.
It reached all the way to the small of your back.
And-And you were so petite that I could put my two hands around your waist.
And you loved maraschino cherries.
- Yong Ja.
- Yes.
So, how are you?
A long time ago, the raven looked down from the sky... and saw that the people of the world were living in darkness.
The ball of light was kept hidden by a selfish, old chief.
So the raven turned himself into a spruce needle... and floated on the river where the chief's daughter came for water.
She drank the spruce needle.
She became pregnant and gave birth to a boy, who was the raven in disguise.
The baby cried and cried... until the chief gave him the ball of light to play with.
As soon as he had the light, the raven turned back into himself.
The raven carried the light into the sky.
From then on, we no longer lived in darkness.

This is Chris in the Morning.
From where I'm sitting,
I got a great view of all the yuletide decorations going up all over town.
That's right.
Everywhere I turn my head, I see ebony birds roosting for the holidays.
You know, twinkling, colored lights are nice, and so are plastic Santas and reindeers and manger scenes.
But, tell you something, friends, nothing like the sight of a beautiful, black-as-pitch raven to get you in the Christmas spirit.
Oh, hey, that reminds me.
Congratulations to our own Marilyn Whirlwind, who's landed the part of the Princess Susitna in this year's raven pageant.
Break a wing, Marilyn.
Whoops!
There stumbles Maggie O'Connell in her usual Christmas mode.
She gets a little accident-prone this time of year, so it's best for your own safety, keep a wide berth.
Hey, this one's for everybody out there.
I understand the suicide rate goes up dramatically around Christmastime.
Yeah, well, you know, it's a stressful time of the year for most people, Maurice.
Yeah.
The thing is, you go through the rest of the year fine.
You've got your friends, you've got your business, you're part of the community.
And then, round the middle of December, if you're alone, you start to feel like an outsider.
Well, you feel alienated.
Here, this is for you, top of your Christmas tree.
Thanks.
You know, it's the nature of a family holiday... to make a single man feel disenfranchised.
You're made to feel like a hungry vagrant with your nose pressed up against a window, staring at somebody else's dinner.
Maurice, there's some people here to see you.
People?
What the hell do they want?
Here, have a raven.
Thanks.
I'm Minnifield.
Hello.
I'm Yung Bong Joo.
This is my dad, Yung Duk Won.
And my grandmom, Yung Yong Ja.
We're very happy to meet you.
Likewise, I'm sure.
- Who are you?
- He's my dad.
- Yeah, I got that part.
And your son.
- Hey, Ed.
Dave.
- Hello, Dr. Fleischman.
- Christmas tree, huh?
- Uh-huh.
Good choice.
Full base. tapering off nicely at the top.
You know, a lot of people go for the Douglas fir, but I'm a spruce man too.
- Watch your end, Dave.
- Okay.
What a smell.
You know, a Christmas tree is wonderful in and of itself, but it evokes so much.
It's images of snowmen, sleigh rides.
- You want us to cut you one?
- Me?
- Uh-huh.
- Guys, I'm Jewish.
- So?
- Well, I mean, a Christmas tree's a major Christian symbol.
Next to the cross itself, you can't get anything that's more Christian than that.
You know what I mean?
Traditionally, Jews try to avoid Christian symbols.
Oh, well, you know, Dave's an animist, and, uh,
- he has a Christmas tree, right, Dave?
- Right.
Ah, yes.
But Dave wasn't raised by Herb and Nadine Fleischman.
Herb and Nadine Fleischman, who would rather be flayed alive... than allow so much as a candy cane, let alone a full-blown Christmas tree, into their home.
- Coming through.
- Not that I haven't fantasized about having a tree.
- Watch it here.
Hold on.
Hold on.
Hey, Lou, you still owe me.
You know, as a kid, our kitchen window faced the living room of this Irish family, the McGoverns.
I used to watch them decorate their tree.
They'd string popcorn, drape tinsel.
Like a Hallmark card.
I mean, this lovely tableau.
Christmas music on the radio.
So warm.
So inviting.
- Watch it.
- Actually, you know, I've always liked Christmas.
It's a great holiday for a Jewish kid.
- I mean, two weeks off from school and nothing expected of you.
- Right here, Ed.
And it's true that I've enjoyed and even embraced other trappings of the holiday season.
The music, the gift-giving.
You don't have to be Republican to celebrate Lincoln's birthday.
So, when you think about it, I'm, uh, I'm probably splitting hairs in denying myself a tree, right?
- Right.
- So, you want one?
Huh.
Let me think about it.
Hey, Fleischman, I got your plaster bandages.
Oh, hey.
Easy.
You all right?
- Why do you put yourself through this?
There's an easier way to get out of it.
- Put myself through what?
- Come on.
Everyone knows you hate going home for Christmas.
- So?
So, don't break your neck.
Just tell your parents you're busy.
First of all, Fleischman, you know, my clumsiness is not part of a subconscious agenda.
- And secondly, tell my parents I'm too busy?
- Yeah.
Fleischman, that is one of your more brainless ideas.
It's Christmas, Fleischman.
Christmas.
You're not too busy.
- Aah!
- Hey, go easy on yourself.
I don't wanna have to use these on you.
- You like the glasses?
- They're cool.
They're hand painted...
from Czechoslovakia.
Look at the details.
You can see every feather.
They're really neat.
What's wrong, hon?
I don't know, Holling.
You seem a little down.
I was watching this Christmas special on TV.
You know that really fat Italian singer...
- and this little boys' choir in this big ol' cathedral.
- Yeah?
Well, it was like I could smell the incense, you know?
Like I was back at Our Lady of Refuge.
Christmas Eve, they always had a midnight Mass.
And just before 12:00, they used to turn off all the lights.
Then the organ would start to play, and the doors would open, and the choir would come down the aisles carrying candles.
Then the altar boys.
Then Father Perone.
They'd all be singing.
I love the ravens, Holling.
I really do.
But it just doesn't feel like... an old-fashioned, Charlie Brown Christmas.
Hi, Grandpa.
Everything checks out.
Letters, documents, blood tests.
I acknowledge he's my son.
I was very young in Korea.
I was 16.
I forged my father's signature so I could get in the Marine Corps.
I was a boy in a man's body.
I did some foolish things.
Never mind.
What do they want?
Ask her what she wants.
- Pork chops.
- No.
Not to eat.
What do you want?
How much do you want from me?
Money.
Dinero.
Money.
- No, no, no.
No.
No dollar.
No.
No dollar.
No, no, no.
- Money, no.
No money.
- No?
- No.
No, no dollar.
- You don't want money?
- No dollar.
Then what are you doing here?
What are they doing here?
- My dad just want to meet you.
- That's it?
That's all?
You just wanna meet me?
- Yeah.
- Okay.
How do?
Pleased to meet you.
Excuse me, Grandpa.
Now, just so we understand each other,
I want you to know that I live up to my obligations.
But I also protect my interests.
If you intend to take me to court, bear in mind that I have a team of lawyers who will eat you for lunch.
That being said, enjoy your stay.
Kids look at holidays materialistically.
I always thought that Hanukkah was a better deal.
I mean, you get eight presents, right?
They're staggered over a week.
You're forced to savor each one.
Careful, Bong.
With Christmas, you get everything all at once.
It's easy to overload.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- We got it.
We got it.
We got it.
There was only one year I envied my neighbor.
Tom McGovern.
He got this autographed Bobby Mercer baseball glove.
God, I loved that glove.
Whoa!
Whoa!
All right.
Whoa.
Okay.
Go ahead.
Boy, it's shedding all over the place.
Yep.
Trees'll do that.
You might put a sheet under it.
Where would you like this, Dr. Fleischman?
Uh, well, over by the fireplace.
- That's an appropriate place, right?
- Yeah.
Not too close though.
Okay.
All righty.
- On three.
One, two, three.
- All right.
Wow.
It's big.
Yeah.
- It's immense.
- Looks good.
- Well, see you later, Dr. Fleischman.
- Wait, wait.
Where are you going?
Bong wants to check out the new sinkhole over by the Kinuk fault.
- Yeah.
- Hey, it's not going anywhere for a few millennia.
- Stick around.
I got sodas and crackers, ice cream and...
- No, thanks, Dr Fleischman.
Wait a sec.
What about the tree?
I mean, what do I do?
Oh.
Decorate it.
Bye.
Uh, excuse me.
I'm afraid I owe you an apology.
Your dress got in the hamper.
I didn't see it.
Yeah.
It got in the wash with my cords.
They bleed a little bit.
No, I'll buy you another one.
No, no.
Now, these things cost a pretty penny, and I insist on buying you another one.
No.
Now, I insist.
All right.
That's settled.
Uh, ma'am?
Gosh, how do I say this?
Uh,
Clearly, we, you and I, had an intimate relationship.
But I don't remember you.
For the life of me, I can't remember a thing about you.
Don't be offended.
I had a lot of relationships with women in those days.
I was young, unattached, in a strange country.
Maybe you could jog my memory.
There was a place that I used to frequent in Seoul.
There was a gal who worked there named, um,
- Kika.
- Kika?
- Kija?
- Kija.
- Kija?
- Yeah.
Yeah.
She was short and had black hair.
- Kija.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
She was a particular favorite of my friend Scooter Wilson.
- Michael...
Wilson.
- Mike Wilson.
Yeah.
Yeah.
That's Scooter.
Now we're gettin' somewhere.
Are you Kija?
Kija?
No.
Ma'am, I didn't wanna say anything in front of the kids, but, if you have any hopes of renewing our relationship in any significant way, that's impossible.
A lot of water's gone under the bridge.
We've gone our separate ways.
Well, if you think about it in the cold light of day, rationally, you'll see that you'd be happier with someone of your own persuasion.
I'm glad we had this chat.
Straightened things out.
Okay, let me get something straight.
The fact that I have you in my living room is meaningless.
I'm not betraying anything.
You're a tree.
Flora, a plant, a nonsentient being.
That's all.
I mean, I know there are people who like to endow you with religious significance, but even at that you're really more of a cultural symbol... like, uh, the Easter bunny, Uncle Sam, Tony the Tiger.
You're something fun.
Something for everybody to enjoy.
- Buddhists, Muslims, Rastafarians,
- Fleischman?
- What?
It's open.
- I think I've hurt my ankle.
- What happened?
- Oh, I slipped and fell off the porch.
Could you take a look at it?
- Yeah, sure.
- Good.
Oh.
Watch it, O'Connell.
You're gonna wreck the furniture.
- Sorry.
- You're not just a menace to yourself.
You're a menace to others as well.
- Sorry.
- All righty, which one?
This left one here.
- Okay.
Easy, easy.
- Nice tree.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Just that.
Nice tree.
- Don't be coy with me, O'Connell.
Go ahead, say it.
- What?
I'm Jewish.
What am I doing with a Christmas tree?
It's inappropriate, right?
I should have a mezuzah, or menorah, both of which, by the way, I do have, and I display proudly for all the goyim to see.
- But, God forbid, a Christmas tree.
- Fleischman, what is your problem?
I'm not the one with a problem.
I'm not the one who, every Christmas, indulges in an orgy of self-destruction.
Well, if you had to face what I face, you wouldn't want to go home either.
All right, I can take a X-ray, but I'm pretty sure this is just a sprain.
- Now, tell me what could be so terrible.
- My mother, for starters.
I mean, from the minute I walk in the door, it's, "When are you gonna get married?
When am I gonna have grandchildren?"
And my father who, of course, agrees with her, tells her to be quiet, and they just start fighting.
And my brother, the iceberg, who thinks any display of emotion is in poor taste, he just retreats to his room and fondles his old swim team trophies.
Well, there has to be something nice about going home.
I mean, sitting around a tree, opening presents.
Oh, the presents.
The presents are the worse part.
I get all these froufrou outfits that I wouldn't wear in a million years.
Come on, O'Connell.
These are your parents.
They raised you.
They love you.
- They're doing the best they can do.
- I know that.
I mean, of course I know that.
Don't you think I know that?
That's what makes it so awful.
I'm a horrible, ungrateful child for even having such thoughts.
It's hopeless.
Tomorrow it'll be waiting at Ruth-Anne's.
A letter from my parents with a round-trip ticket.
I can't begin to describe to you the sense of dread I feel at the thought of opening that envelope.
There's no escape.
- Oh!
- Stay off the ankle.
- Good night, Fleischman.
Thanks for nothing.
Attention, Cicelians.
Only two shopping days left till Christmas.
Hey, I see the Minnifields out for a family stroll.
How nice.
Merry Christmas.
This just in from the Cicely Choral Society.
All members are requested to gather at Mel's Guns and Ammo 7:00 tonight for caroling.
Please remember to dress warm.
Also, a reminder to anybody attending tomorrow night's raven pageant.
You're welcome to take pictures, but, please, no flash equipment.
It's hazardous to the performers.
Okay.
Here's one for Maurice.
- Mmm.
What smells so good, Ruth-Anne?
- Raven bread.
- I make it every Christmas.
Try some.
- Okay.
Mmm, pumpernickel.
I'll take a loaf.
Listen, I need some of these Christmas tree decorations.
Ornaments, tinsel, the usual.
Well, we have some raven lights, and, um, raven ornaments.
Do you have anything else, you know, besides Heckle and Jeckle?
- I mean, what do you put on your tree?
- I don't have a tree, Joel.
- No?
- It pains me.
The very thought of chopping down a healthy, living thing and displaying it in my living room... until there's nothing left except a brittled, withered shell of its former self.
- Well, what about the fake kind?
- To tell you the truth, Joel, I happen to be an atheist.
- Huh, you're an atheist?
No kidding.
I always admired atheists.
I think it takes a lot of faith.
I mean, you know, conviction to deny the existence of a supreme being.
Oh, I believe in a supreme being.
I just don't think that she takes human form.
- Interesting, Ruth-Anne.
- Okay, Ruth-Anne.
Let's get it over with.
Here's your letter, dear.
- That's 11.95, Joel.
- They're going to St. Thomas.
Let me take a look at that, O'Connell.
"We hope you forgive us,"
"but the Morrisons offered us their time-share, and Daddy really needs the vacation."
"Maybe we'll get together at Easter."
- Congratulations.
- You don't have to go home now.
- Yeah, O'Connell.
You can stop abusing yourself.
- What's the matter?
- Oh, nothing.
I'm just, um...
- What?
- I don't know.
I'm just,
- Surprised?
Yes.
Well, no.
No, no.
I'm just so,
- Relieved?
- Yes.
Relieved.
Relieved and,
- Happy?
- Right.
I'm relieved and happy and surprised.
I mean, what a fantastic relief.
What a happy surprise.
I'm just so, so... so.
- Excuse me.
Uh, could we turn that down?
- Sure.
Oh, no, no, no.
No, thank you.
No, I'm fine.
Oh, yeah.
Dad?
Look, I don't have a clue here.
- Bong, what's he saying?
- Dad say he's happy you're his dad.
Oh, well, that's fine.
What?
Music.
Music.
Here is my gift for Baby Jesus.
Mm-mm-mm-mm.
Chris, are you planning on some kind of special service for Christmas this year?
No.
Nothing special.
I mean,
I thought I'd have a post-raven question-and-answer with some of the pageant participants.
- Hmm.
- What?
I was thinking of something a little more traditional.
Yeah, well, yeah, we could sing some Christmas songs, Holling.
Well, something more along the lines of a Mass.
Shelly's Catholic.
She misses her Christmas Mass.
Oh, yeah.
Well, you know, that's some serious codified ritual, Holling.
- You know, that's way out of my league, man.
- You know a little Latin, don't you?
In vino veritas.
Tempus fugit.
That kind of stuff.
Oh, hey, I got a Latin copy of the Aeneid laying around somewhere.
You know, I could read Shelly a couple of lines from that.
No, I don't think that'd do it.
But thanks anyway, Chris.
- Hi, Shelly.
- Hey, Maggie.
Congratulations.
I heard you aren't going home.
- Oh, yeah.
It's great.
It's an incredible relief.
- Dave made eggnog.
Oh, wonderful.
You know, I really look forward to Christmas Eve... 'cause it'll be the first time in my life I get to spend it entirely alone.
There'll be nobody bothering me, placing demands on me, expectations.
- It'll just be quiet and peaceful.
- Holy.
Hmm, that's an interesting way of looking at it.
I mean, I don't have to deal with my mother or my brother.
- Our Father...
- Oh, well, my father.
He's impossible at Christmas.
There's just no talking to him.
No...
- Communion.
Exactly.
You know, when my parents told me they weren't going to have Christmas, in a way that was the best gift they could have given me.
Maggie, uh, you've never met my parents before.
They're just in from Barrow.
Mom, Dad, this is Maggie O'Connell.
Oh, man.
Maurice, I tell you.
I hear those carolers, you know, all those human voices ascending up to heaven... in a harmonic pyramid of sound.
I get very zoned.
I get very light in my galoshes, you know?
Does that happen to you?
- Uh-uh.
- No?
- Hey, uh, where's the Kinder at?
- At the house.
At my house, which no longer feels like my house.
I had to get out and get some fresh air.
Hear some English.
- Yeah, well.
- You know, Chris, all my life I've dreamed of having a son.
A little towheaded tyke I could bounce on my knee,
- teach to ride, hunt, fish.
- Yeah, a little mini Maurice, right?
Yeah, and what do I get?
A middle-aged Chinaman.
- I thought Duk Won's Korean.
- It's all the same difference.
Well, Maurice, a lot to be said for having grown kids.
You know, they're out of the house.
You don't have to worry about car insurance, you know, tuition.
It's not the age, Chris.
I could handle that.
Hell, I can handle anything.
Physical impairment, low I.Q. I could handle that.
I could even handle if he was a bookworm.
I'd find some way to accept him.
But, if he was only,
White?
Yeah.
White.
I understand this thing about you and your brother Bernard and your decision to be a person of color.
I even respect it.
Hell, everybody's got a right to make their own mistakes.
But this, this is my own flesh and blood.
This cuts a little close to the bone.
You know what I mean?
- It's the other.
- Other what?
Maurice, think of concentric circles.
The inner circle is ourselves, then the family, then the tribe, then the neighboring tribe, so on and so on.
The further you get away from the center, the more foreign things become.
The people in the outer circles, they become the "other".
- What's your point?
- Well, with sex, the other's good.
I mean, you were probably very attracted to Duk Won's mother way back when.
But, you take the other from the outer and make it part of the inner, sometimes it doesn't work out.
Chris, no matter how you explain this thing, it's a nightmare.
This man is my son.
I don't like the way he looks.
I don't like the way he talks.
I don't like what he eats.
Well, if it's any consolation, Maurice, you know, your feelings aren't instinctual.
- No?
- No.
It's cultural.
- Well, how the hell could that be a consolation?
- It's learned behavior.
- So?
- So, you can unlearn it.
Hi, Marilyn.
On your way to rehearsal?
- Run-through.
- You nervous?
About performing in front of people?
- No.
- You know, Marilyn, I'm familiar with parts of the New Testament.
I also know about the winter solstice tie-in.
Well, this might seem like a shocking display of ignorance, but I seem to be the only one in town who doesn't know.
- I mean, what exactly is this thing with the raven?
- Thing?
Well, I don't understand what it has to do with Christmas.
A long time ago, the raven looked down from the sky... and saw that the people of the world were living in darkness.
The ball of light was kept hidden by a selfish, old chief.
So, the raven turned himself into a spruce needle... and floated on the river where the chief's daughter came for water.
She drank the spruce needle.
She became pregnant and gave birth to a boy, which was the raven in disguise.
The baby cried and cried until the chief gave him the ball of light to play with.
As soon as he had the light, the raven turned back into himself and carried the light into the sky.
From then on, we no longer lived in darkness.
Wow, that's a great story.
- Hello, Dad.
- Maurice.
- Hi, Grandpop.
Yeah.
Uh, I just came in for some coffee.
- Uh, no, No.
No tea.
Thank you.
Uh, no, no.
I'll just,
Would you tell her that I've got some desk work that I've got to clean up.
- So, I'll just take this and go in there.
Um, Grandpop?
Dad wants to know if you'd like to go on a hike with him.
- Hike?
- Up the mountains.
- Oh, uh, yeah.
Yeah.
I'd like to take a hike, but I don't think I'm gonna have time today.
- Excuse me.
It's open.
- Grandma wants to talk to you.
- Grandmom say you're not happy.
- No, no.
I'm just,
- She said let her finish.
- All right.
All these years, Grandma was afraid to tell you that you had a son.
She knew it would be a big shock.
Grandmom didn't want to come here.
But my daddy said it's time to meet his father.
It was a mistake.
She's sorry we came.
"Ghastly grim and ancient raven wandering from the nightly shore"
"Tell me what thy lordly name is on the night's Plutonian shore."
"Quoth the raven, 'Nevermore."
Well, that's how Mr. Poe saw the raven.
You know, lots of references in Western literature do tend toward the negative.
Like most things in life, when it comes to transcendental symbols, one man's savior is another man's pair of lead boots.
- Here you go.
- Thank you.
You're very welcome.
Listen, Duk, your mom is upset with me.
There's probably some justification for it.
I mean, I sometimes give the impression that, uh,
I'm a little bit insensitive.
But I never meant to hurt her feelings.
I don't know how much of this is getting through the static, but I'm gonna be straight with you.
You are not the son that I bargained for.
Not by a long shot.
But, you are my progeny.
I am your father.
- Father?
- Yeah.
Yeah, father.
So, I think we should make a good-faith effort to understand each other, get to know each other a little bit.
Uh, anyway, cheers.
You like sour mash, huh?
Uh, Dave, bring Duk here another round.
Coming up.
Pretty good there.
So, uh, what do you, uh, what do you do?
- Do?
- Do.
You know, job?
Work?
Do for a living?
Okay, look.
Truck driver?
No.
Musician?
How about barber?
Haircut?
Okay, look.
Me.
Me.
Astronaut.
Astronaut.
- Yeah, yeah.
Right.
- Astronaut.
Yeah, that's right.
Now, you.
Gisa.
- Gisa.
- Gisa.
No.
I don't understand.
Yeah, sure.
Uh-huh.
That's a diode.
- A capacitor.
- Capacitor.
Yeah.
Capacitor.
- Yeah.
Let me see that.
- Thank you.
A transistor.
This is a circuit.
- Circuit.
- Yeah, circuit.
Yeah.
You're an engineer.
Engineer.
Gisa.
- An electrical engineer.
- Hey.
Hey, guys.
He's an engineer.
You know, I know my way around a slide rule pretty well too.
That's all right.
An engineer, huh?
- Engineer.
- Yeah.
Well, cheers.
- Ch'ukpae.
- Yeah.
Choopay?
- Ch'ukpae.
- Choopay.
Yeah.
You're no, You're no wimp, are you?
Strong too.
Yeah.
You, uh, you lift?
Uh, pump iron.
- Oh.
Yo key.
- Yo key.
- Yo key.
- Yeah.
Arnold?
- "Ahnulda"?
- Arnold.
Movie.
Movie.
Arnold.
Oh, Arnold.
Yeah, Arnold.
Okay.
- One.
- Huh.
- Two.
- Two.
- Three.
No, no.
It's fine.
Hey, that's not bad.
Now, wait here.
We're gonna do this right.
Huh?
Huh?
Is this great?
I got some chestnuts.
I can put 'em in the oven.
- What?
- Well, where are the lights?
- Right here.
- Fleischman, you gotta put the lights on before the ornaments.
Aha!
See, that's why I brought you here.
I needed an expert.
- You're gonna have to take all the ornaments off.
- Okay.
No problem.
We can do that.
See, what you do is you string the lights.
But test them first to see if they work.
Then you put the little ornaments at the top and you work your way down, and you put the heavier, bigger ornaments on the lower branches.
See?
I'm enjoying this already.
And then, people put tinsel, but I usually don't.
- Yeah, me neither.
It's,
- Tacky.
- My sentiments exactly.
- Okay.
Well, look, Fleischman, you know, it's really easy decorating a Christmas tree.
It's common sense.
- You don't need me.
So, um, I'll see you later.
- Wait a minute.
Where are you going?
- Well, I have to get things organized.
- Things?
What things?
- Well, my taxes, for one.
- Your taxes?
O'Connell, it's Christmas Eve.
They're not due till April.
Come on.
I'm gonna string some popcorn.
Mull some wine.
I'm really not in the mood.
"I, 'said the cow, all white and red.
'I gave him my manger for his bed."
"I gave him my hay to pillow his head."
"I, 'said the cow, all white and red."
"So every beast by some good spell in the stable dark was glad to tell..."
"of the gift he gave Immanuel."
"The gift he gave Immanuel."
It's an old legend that on Christmas Eve at midnight, all the animals fall to their knees and speak, praising the newborn Jesus.
Back in the winter of '69, my dad was serving a short time for a D.U.I., and I don't know where my mom was.
Anyway, I was home alone Christmas Eve, and I stayed up extra kind of late to see if my dog Buddy would talk.
And he did.
I don't remember his exact words, but that's not important.
What matters is that a seven-year-old boy... experienced his own personal epiphany.
What's my point?
Well, it's that Christmas reveals itself to us each in a personal way, be it secular or sacred.
Whatever Christmas is, and it's many things to many people, we all own a piece of it.
It's like, well, it's kind of like Santa's bag.
Inside there's a gift for everybody.
My Christmas wish for you tonight?
May your dog talk.
Good night, Cicely.
Merry Christmas.
- Dave, where's Holling?
- He said he had an errand to run.
- Well, I'm gonna stop by church, so tell him I'll meet him at the pageant.
- Okay.
Just a second.
- Hey, O'Connell.
- Hey, Fleischman.
- What, you're not going to the raven pageant?
- Um...
You know, I tried.
I really did.
I gave it my best shot.
It just didn't work.
Scratch the plum pudding, there's a matzo ball underneath.
- I'm a Jew.
That's all there is to it.
- What are you talking about?
I have something that I think belongs to you.
Close your eyes.
Come on.
Just close 'em.
Step out here.
Oh, come on.
Come on.
Just close your eyes one sec.
One sec, that's all.
Hold on.
Hold on.
All righty.
One sec.
Keep 'em closed.
Open 'em.
Wow.
Merry Christmas, O'Connell.
- Thanks, Fleischman.
- Yeah.
Belongs here.
Excuse me.
- I didn't mean to intrude.
Listen, uh, I just wanna tell you that you did a good job.
It couldn't have been easy without a husband, without a father figure.
But you should be very proud.
Duk Won, he's a fine man.
- Yeah.
Yeah.
He's smart.
And strong.
Very, very strong.
Geonjang hada.
"Kunjong",
- Say that again.
- Geonjang hada.
You geonjang hada.
Geonjang hada.
Geonjang hada.
That's "strong and big".
Yeah.
That's what you used to call me.
I remember now.
You had beautiful, long hair.
It reached all the way to the small of your back.
And you were so petite that I could put my two hands around your waist.
And you loved maraschino cherries.
- Yong Ja.
- Yes.
So, how are you?
A long time ago, the raven looked down from the sky... and saw that the people of the world were living in darkness.
The ball of light was kept hidden by a selfish, old chief.
So the raven turned himself into a spruce needle... and floated on the river where the chiefs daughter came for water.
She drank the spruce needle.
She became pregnant and gave birth to a boy, who was the raven in disguise.
The baby cried and cried... until the chief gave him the ball oflight to play with.
As soon as he had the light, the raven turned back into himself.
The raven carried the light into the sky.
From then on, we no longer lived in darkness.
Captain's log, star date 45233.1.
Our terraforming mission to Doraf I has been cancelled and the Enterprise recalled to Star base 234.
Fleet Admiral Brackett would not discuss the matter on subspace for reasons she said would soon be clear.
I apologize, Captain, for the mystery, but we must attempt to contain this information at least as long as possible.
I must admit you've piqued my curiosity, Admiral.
Three weeks ago, one of our most celebrated ambassadors, an adviser to Federation leaders for generations, disappeared.
He left no word of his destination.
Two days ago, intelligence reports placed him on Romulus.
I assure you, it was an unauthorized visit.
Computer, initiate linkage with Star base computer system Alpha 29.
- Linkage complete.
- A defection?
If it is, the damage to Federation security would be immeasurable.
Taken on Romulus by long-range scanner.
Computer, enhance image in section four delta.
Captain's log, star date 45236.4.
As I study the reports on Spock's disappearance,
I cannot help but feel a deeper, more personal concern about this mission, for I know this man through his father.
Barely a year ago, I shared a mind-meld with the Vulcan, Sarek.
Now we must meet again, as I attempt to find an explanation for his son's actions.
We'll reach Vulcan in less than an hour, Captain.
Inform Sarek's wife of our plans.
It's taken care of.
She's transporting over at 0700.
- And Sarek?
- He's too ill to make the trip.
The man is dying.
It's my honour to tell him his son may have betrayed the Federation.
How well do you know Spock?
I only met him once.
What I know is out of history books, and my mind-meld with his father.
That covers a lot of ground.
Not as much as you'd imagine.
Sarek and Spock...
Well, sometimes, fathers and sons...
Understood.
One other thing.
Look at this.
Turned up in an intelligence sweep.
- Metal fragments.
- What do you think?
Possibly components, identified as Vulcan.
From a Ferengi ship?
They were in crates marked "Medical Supplies".
Contraband.
It's been sent to Vulcan for identification.
Starfleet have requested that we lend a hand.
Mint tea.
It's been years since I've had any.
Vulcans have some strange concoction they call mint.
You'd never recognize it.
Perrin, do you know why I've come to Vulcan?
I must talk to you about Spock.
He didn't even say goodbye to his father before he left.
Is it possible he could have been abducted?
No!
He wrapped up all his affairs carefully.
He knew he was going.
Do you have any idea why he might have disappeared like this?
Captain, as far as I'm concerned, he disappeared a long time ago.
Is it inappropriate to ask what happened between you?
Not between us.
Between Spock and his father.
They had argued for years.
That was family.
But when the debates over the Cardassian War began, he attacked Sarek's position.
Publicly.
He showed no loyalty for his father.
I was not aware Sarek was offended by Spock's opposition.
I was offended.
I made sure that Spock knew it.
I'm very protective of my husband.
I do not apologize for it.
Does Sarek have any idea why Spock might have left?
I don't know.
If you could see Sarek as I do, wasting in bed, whispering to himself...
He wants to see his son.
He wants to heal any rift that may still remain.
Now, it may be too late.
Perrin, would you allow me to see Sarek?
If it were anyone else, I would never permit it.
But you are a part of him, and he of you.
The Vulcans can't identify the fragments, but they've determined the metal is a dentarium alloy.
That indicates they're Vulcan.
It also means that whatever this was, it was designed for use in space.
From the damage, it was a high-speed impact.
A Ferengi ship went down in the Hanolin asteroid belt.
Debris covered 100 square kilometers.
- Is it a weapons array?
- I thought so.
But the Vulcans have no record of stolen weapons or parts.
This is going to be like doing a jigsaw puzzle with no idea what the picture should be.
Yep.
He is like this most of the time.
His emotions have taken over.
Sometimes, I can bring him out of it.
Sarek!
You will listen.
Go from me.
Picard is here.
No more chaos!
No more.
I will leave you alone with him.
He will either acknowledge you or he won't.
Sarek!
I've come a long way to see you.
I will not answer.
- I must talk to you about your son.
- I wish no one with me.
About Spock.
Spock?
Yes.
He's missing.
Is that you?
Picard?
Hello, old friend.
- You're here, on Vulcan.
- I need your help.
I must find Spock.
- He's not here.
- I know.
He's been reported on Romulus.
- Romulus?
- Yes.
- Why?
- I hoped to find that out from you.
On Romulus.
You're going there, aren't you?
- To find him.
- Yes.
Do you have any idea what might have taken him to Romulus?
No.
Is there anyone on Romulus he might know or choose to contact?
Pardek?
Who is Pardek?
It could be Pardek.
Who is Pardek?
He is a Romulan senator.
Spock has maintained a relationship with him.
I don't know how they met.
At the Khitomer conference, I'd imagine.
- Pardek represented Romulus?
- Yes.
I'm sure he did.
In fact, I recall Spock coming to me with optimism about maintaining a continual dialogue with the Romulans.
I told him it was illogical to maintain such an expectation.
Spock was always so impressionable.
This Romulan, Pardek, had no support at home.
Of course, in the end, I was proven correct.
I gave Spock the benefit of experience, of logic.
He never listened.
Never listened.
It has been suggested that Spock might have defected.
Never.
I will accept many things, but never that.
But you believe he might have gone to see Pardek?
The Romulan senator?
How do you know Pardek?
I've heard of him.
That's what he's done.
He's gone to see Pardek.
Do you know what business they may have?
No, I never knew what Spock was doing.
As a boy, he would disappear into the mountains.
I would ask what he'd done.
He refused to tell me.
I insisted that he tell me.
He would not.
I forbade him to go.
He ignored me.
I punished him.
He endured it, silently.
But always he returned to the mountains.
One might as well ask the river not to run.
But secretly, I admired him, the proud core of him that would not yield.
Sarek.
We're a part of each other.
I know that he has caused you pain.
But I also know that you love him.
Tell him, Picard.
Peace and long life.
Live long and...
Live long and...
Spock.
My son.
And prosper.
Captain's log, star date 45240. 1.
To cross the Neutral Zone, I require a cloaked ship.
To that end, I have set a course for the Klingon Homeworld.
After all we did for Gowron in the recent war,
I'm certain he'll be happy to return a favour.
- Still no reply from the Klingons?
- No, sir.
He's ignoring me.
He has to be.
After three days, he could find a minute for you.
- Sir.
- Yes, Lieutenant?
I believe I know why our messages are not being answered.
Gowron has been rewriting history.
Rewriting history?
He is claiming it was his courage, his genius, that ended the civil war.
I see.
The new version makes no mention of the Federation's help in his rise to power.
If Worf's right, we'll be an uncomfortable reminder.
He can take all the credit, I don't care.
But I do need a ship.
If Gowron won't talk to me, get me someone on the High Council.
K'tal?
- Yes, sir.
- Captain.
I have a visual identification of Senator Pardek of Romulus.
This is a Barolian record of a trade negotiation in which Pardek participated four years ago.
- That's all?
- Yes.
Run it again.
Computer, freeze.
Call up the intelligence scan of Spock on Romulus.
Computer, enhance far left figure and compare.
Same man.
Pardek.
One question answered.
What do we know of him?
He has been in public service since his youth, a senator for nine decades.
He is considered a man of the people.
He has sponsored many reforms.
Reportedly, Romulan leadership considers him to be a radical.
He has advocated peace throughout his career.
I can see why Spock would cultivate a relationship with him.
Where would we find him, other than at the Romulan Senate?
He represents the Krocton segment.
He maintains a dwelling there.
- Thank you, Mr. Data.
- There is more, sir.
I took the liberty of expanding my search and found that Pardek has several relatives in the Krocton segment.
You can locate him there, on the third day of the week when the Senate is not in session.
Mr. Data, your resourcefulness never ceases to amaze me.
Thank you, sir.
Captain, we are being hailed by the Klingon Homeworld.
Gowron or K'tal?
Neither, sir.
The junior adjutant to the diplomatic delegation.
Junior adjutant!
Name?
B'iJik, sir.
- On screen.
- Greetings, Captain.
I regret that Gowron and the High Council are too busy to talk to you.
Is Gowron aware that we have been transmitting messages for three days?
Gowron wishes he could talk with everyone who wants an audience, but the demands on his time are formidable.
- If you would leave a message?
- A message?
Very well.
Tell Gowron, leader of the High Council of the Klingon Empire, that his Arbiter of Succession, Jean-Luc Picard, needs a favour.
A favour?
I require a cloaked vessel.
A cloaked vessel?
This is no small favour, Captain.
Our mission could have repercussions for the whole quadrant.
How would it benefit the Klingon Empire?
I'm sure Gowron will ask.
The only benefit to the Klingon Empire would be our gratitude.
- You want me to tell him that?
- Yes.
And please add that if he is unable to provide us with a ship, then I am sure there are others in the Klingon Empire who would be willing to help me.
And then, they would have our gratitude.
I see.
Also, please tell Gowron that I am immensely gratified that he is prospering so well.
A tribute to his skilled leadership.
They're not removable, are they?
- Removable?
- Your ears.
No, Doctor.
They are fully integrated components.
- We'll need moulds of his ears.
- And his skin colour?
We'll need some tests on his skin pigmentation.
Making it look Romulan won't be difficult.
We just have to make sure we can change it back again.
Your right eye is .004
higher than your left.
Nobody's perfect.
But...
If you want a proper fit to your prosthetic, trust your tailor.
- Anything from Gowron?
- No, sir.
But Mr. La Forge has made progress with the metal fragments.
These two still have an appointment to have their hairpieces designed.
30 minutes, Number One.
What we have is a navigational deflector array.
- Or what's left of one.
- Who would want a Vulcan deflector?
Beats me.
Every question we answer brings up two more.
- Are you certain it's Vulcan?
- Metallurgical analysis confirms it.
And a molecular pattern trace has identified the ship as T'Pau.
Decommissioned years ago and sent to the surplus depot at Qualor II.
It's meant to still be there.
- Worf to Capt Picard.
- Yes, Lieutenant?
A Klingon vessel is decloaking off our port bow, compliments of Gowron.
Mr. Worf, convey my gratitude to the Captain and advise him that Mr. Data and I will be transporting over shortly.
I'd like to go to Qualor II, sir.
See what's out there.
Agreed.
Thank you, Mr. La Forge.
I know my duty, Captain.
When I am given orders, I follow them, but I do not like secrets.
I want to know why we are going on this mission.
I'm sorry.
It's a classified matter.
You're going after the defector, aren't you?
Defector?
Do you think information like that stays a secret?
Ambassador Spock has gone to Romulus and you are going after him.
Captain, your orders are to take us to Romulus and to bring us back.
That is all I will discuss.
If we are discovered by the Romulans, it means death for us all.
I realize that.
Very well, Captain.
We have set a course for Romulus.
It may not be what you're used to on a Starfleet ship.
Quite nice.
Thank you.
Capt K'Vada, is this the Captain's quarters, or my own?
Both.
We have limited space.
We are a military ship, not a pleasure craft.
Of course.
This will be fine.
You will sleep Klingon-style.
We do not soften our bodies by putting down a pad.
Good!
I prefer it that way.
You will take meals with us.
But we do not serve Federation food.
I've been looking forward to gagh.
Haven't had it for ages.
Very fresh.
Well, Captain, we're at the border of the Neutral Zone.
You mean to do this, do you?
Yes, I do.
First Officer's log, star date 45240.6.
We are nearing Qualor II, home of a Federation surplus depot operated by the Zakdorn.
We hope to find out how the salvaged deflector array ended up in the hands of the Ferengi.
- I've made contact, Commander.
- On screen.
I'm Cmdr William Riker of the Starship Enterprise.
Klim Dokachin,
Quartermaster, Surplus Depot Z- 15.
I need information on a Vulcan ship, the T'Pau.
- You got it a few years ago.
- Did you arrange an appointment?
An appointment?
No.
Then I will be unable to help you.
You may communicate with Scheduling.
Who does he think he is?
The Quartermaster of the supply yard, with information you need.
Right.
Mr. Worf, re-establish communication.
Aye, sir.
Mr. Dokaychin?
Dokachin.
Klim Dokachin.
Mr. Dokachin, the information I need is of major importance to the Federation.
I need access to logs and files.
My people can do the work.
I don't allow outsiders into my computer system.
Alright.
One of your people can do the work.
I wish I had the people to spare.
I don't.
Well, sir, what would you suggest?
I don't know.
Contact me when you reach orbit.
I don't believe this!
He's king of his particular hill, Commander.
You have to treat him that way.
Counsellor, this feels like a perfect job for you.
Thank you for coming on board, Mr. Dokachin.
Quite a ship you have.
We're linked to your computer if you could access the files.
I don't usually see them in such good condition.
By the time they get to me, they're always falling apart.
We must find this ship and you're the only one who can help us.
- Who are you?
- Deanna Troi, ship's Counsellor.
He must figure we don't get to see a lot of handsome women out here, and someone like you might get a little more cooperation from me.
He's probably right.
What was the name of that ship?
The T'Pau?
The T'Pau.
Vulcan registry.
There.
Logged in star date 41344.
- Where's the ship now?
- Docked.
Section 18, gamma 12.
- Want me to take you there?
- I'd appreciate it.
Helmsman, lay in a heading 141 by 208, ahead slow, 200 kph.
I suppose this is your first visit to a junkyard, isn't it?
You'd be surprised at some of the things I find on board these ships!
I once found a 14-foot Caldorian eel on board a freighter, in someone's locker.
Are you serious?
If there's time, I'll show it to you.
I still have it.
Nursed her back to health.
We are approaching the coordinates.
On screen.
What?
Where is it?
What happened to it?
- These are the coordinates.
- The T'Pau is missing?
The T'Pau is missing!
How can a ship disappear from your depot?
I am not used to losing things.
I will find your ship for you.
The T'Pau is cross-referenced in four directories.
When it arrived, was it stripped of armaments, sensors?
Of course.
Can you tell us what happened to its navigational deflector?
It went to the Tripoli, a holding vessel on the rim of the shipyard.
It's not there any more.
What's left of it is in our cargo bay.
- How can that be?
- Maybe we should visit the Tripoli.
In all the time that the Zakdorn have operated this depot, nothing has ever been lost.
Never.
- Approaching the coordinates, sir.
- On screen.
I do not understand this.
This is not possible!
We beam goods to the Tripoli on a regular schedule.
We made a shipment yesterday.
Another is set for today.
It must be there.
- When is today's transport?
- Just over two hours from now.
A shipment of deuterium storage tanks.
Ensign, align the Enterprise like an abandoned ship.
Mr. La Forge, when we're in position, shut down the engines and all systems except sensors and life support.
Someone will be here to receive those storage tanks.
I'd be interested to know who that is.
These quarters were intended for one, with but a single sleeping space.
I'm sure the Klingons found it amusing to put us here together.
Since I do not require sleep,
I propose you take the shelf, sir.
I am content to stand.
Very well, Mr. Data, thank you.
- Are you comfortable, sir?
- I suppose so.
Goodnight, Captain.
Sleep well, sir.
Thank you.
- What are you doing?
- Sir?
Was I making noise, sir?
No, not exactly.
I was processing the information we accumulated on Romulan society.
I am preparing to impersonate a Romulan.
I see.
- Shall I discontinue, sir?
- No, please, go on.
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing, sir.
- I am organising my files.
- But you were looking at me.
I am sorry if I was disturbing you.
I will not look in your direction.
Do you not wish to sleep, sir?
I don't think so, Mr. Data.
Let's go on with the files.
I'd be happy to.
I have studied the Krocton segment, as asked, and have chosen a site for transport.
Capt K'Vada to Picard.
Please come to the bridge.
Captain.
We've monitored a subspace message that might interest you.
Sarek is dead.
Commander, sensors detect a ship approaching at warp speed.
Identification?
Negative.
No transponder signal, no subspace marker.
They don't want to be identified.
- It's coming out of warp, sir.
- On screen.
Sensors indicate a combat vessel, origin undetermined, heavily armed.
Mass and density suggest that it's fully loaded with cargo.
From these scans, a good deal of that cargo is weaponry.
The ship is entering sector 12, delta 4.
He's taking the position assigned to the Tripoli.
The coordinates are identical.
Readings show surface-to-ship transport has begun.
Bring the engines back on line and restore all systems to normal.
He's powering up, turning to starboard.
- Open a channel.
- Open.
This is Cmdr William Riker of the USS Enterprise.
Identify yourself.
I repeat, you have entered a Federation depot.
Identify yourself.
The ship is locking phasers.
Shields up.
Red alert.
- They easily match our armament.
- It's coming about.
If you do not respond, we will take that as hostile action.
There's an energy build-up in their phaser banks.
Sir, they're activating weapons.
- Forward shields at 72 percent.
- Boost power to the shields.
Mr. Worf, lock on to their weapons systems only and prepare to fire.
Forward shields down to 68 percent.
Aft shields, 40 percent.
On my mark, .75 burst.
We just want to get their attention.
- Ready, sir.
- Fire.
Their forward shields are damaged.
We destroyed one of their phaser arrays.
There's collateral damage in the cargo area.
I'm picking up massive power fluctuations, internal explosions.
With all those armaments, that ship will blow.
Well, Mr. Data, what do you think?
I would not have thought it possible, sir.
I am eager to test the success of our efforts.
It does remain to be seen whether the Romulans will accept us.
Captain, you have seemed unusually pensive since we received the news of Ambassador Sarek's death.
Sarek and I share a particular bond.
Our lives touched in an unusual way.
I admit I feel the effects of his death.
The tenor of this mission has changed, at least for me.
We were sent to confront Spock about his disappearance.
Now I also have to tell him that his father is dead.
I do not entirely understand, sir.
As a Vulcan, Ambassador Spock would simply see death as the logical result of his father's illness.
It's never quite that simple, not even for a Vulcan.
Certainly not for Spock, who is half-human.
Years spent in conflict.
And now the chance to resolve those differences is gone.
Considering the long life span of Vulcans, it does seem odd they chose not to resolve those differences in the time allowed.
Father and son.
Both proud, stubborn, more alike than either is prepared to admit.
A lifetime spent building emotional barriers.
They're very difficult to break down.
And now the time has come when it's too late.
It's a difficult moment.
It's a lonely one.
It's a moment that Spock is about to face.
Don't you two look sweet?
Be careful, Android.
Some Romulan beauty might take a liking to you.
Lick that paint right off your ears.
You!
Do you know what the Romulans will do to you if they discover who you are?
I have a good idea.
We're ready to transport to the surface.
Just so we understand each other, my orders don't include rescue missions!
Senator Pardek.
You received my message.
I got here as quickly as I could, Proconsul.
What do you know of this human?
Jean-Luc Picard, a Starfleet captain.
- I know nothing of him.
- You haven't seen him recently?
To my knowledge, I have never seen him.
I have received intelligence indicating he's on his way here, perhaps here already.
Here on Romulus?
Yes.
Curious, isn't it?
We'd better find out if the report is accurate or merely rumour.
Circulate his likeness to the security forces.
Remind them that he's probably disguised as one of us.
I'll see to it.
This is the street where the scan of Spock and Pardek was taken, sir.
Allowing for distortions, I can verify the architectural features.
Where were they standing?
Data, you're moving about in a very, well, android way.
I am sorry, Captain.
I will be more careful.
Don't call me Captain.
I understand, sir.
I have found the place where they were standing.
- Where?
- It is here.
At this doorway.
A legal intercessor's office.
The name is similar to Pardek's.
It would appear to be a relative.
Not open for business yet.
Nonetheless, I recommend we keep this location under observation.
I determined Pardek's routine.
When the Senate is not in session, he invariably comes to this section after the median hour.
Very well.
Let's sample the local cuisine, shall we?
Do you know what time the intercessor's office opens?
Why do you want to know?
I need his services.
He was recommended.
I haven't seen you here before.
We're here for the day, from the city of Rateg.
- Rateg?
I don't think so!
- Why do you say that?
You don't sound like it.
It is a misconception that all Rategs have the same inflection.
In fact...
We come from several kilometers outside the city.
Or from the security forces to watch the intercessor's office?
- Is he in trouble?
- You are mistaken, madam.
Doesn't matter to me.
I don't know when he opens.
Eat your soup, courtesy of a loyal establishment.
Jolan true.
I don't think we can stay here too long.
We may not have to.
Direct your view to the far corner, sir.
Very good, Senator.
Senator.
We seem to be having some problems...
- Is that not Pardek?
- I believe it is.
Perhaps you should appear to enjoy your soup, sir.
I'll take care of that.
Come.
- Do not move!
- What?
You've made a mistake.
Quiet!
Come with us.
Wait here.
What for?
What have you brought us here for?
Welcome to Romulus, Capt Picard.
Don't let our soldiers frighten you.
We had to get you off the street as quickly as we could.
Romulan Security knows that you're here.
I am Pardek.
You are among friends, Captain.
I have come on an urgent mission from the Federation.
- I'm looking for Ambassador Spock.
- Indeed.
You have found him, Capt Picard.
PICARD:
Captain's log, stardate 45233.1.
Our terraforming mission to Doraf I has been canceled and the Enterprise recalled to Starbase 234.
Fleet Admiral Brackett would not discuss the matter on subspace for reasons she said would soon be clear.
I apologize, Captain, for the mystery, but we must attempt to contain the information
I'm about to reveal to you, at least as long as possible.
I must admit, you've piqued my curiosity, admiral.
Three weeks ago one of our most celebrated ambassadors, an advisor to Federation leaders for generations, disappeared.
He left no word of his destination.
Two days ago, intelligence reports placed him on Romulus, and I assure you it was an unauthorized visit.
Computer, initiate linkage between this terminal and Starbase Computer System Alpha-2-9.
COMPUTER:
Linkage complete.
A defection?
If it is, the damage to Federation security would be immeasurable.
Taken on Romulus by long-range scanner.
Computer, enhance image in Section 4-Delta.
[BLEEPING]
Subs corrected by awaqeded.
PICARD:
Space, the final frontier.
These are the voyages of the starship Enterprise.
Its continuing mission:
to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no one has gone before.
PICARD:
Captain's log, stardate 45236.4.
As I study the intelligence reports on Ambassador Spock's disappearance,
I cannot help but feel a deeper, more personal concern about this mission for I know this man through his father.
It was barely a year ago that I shared a mind-meld with the Vulcan Sarek.
Now we must meet again as I attempt to find an explanation for his son's actions.
We're coming into orbit of Vulcan in less than an hour, Captain.
We should tell Sarek's wife of our plans.
It's already been taken care of.
She's transporting over at 0700.
And Sarek?
She says he's too ill to make the trip with her.
The man is dying.
And it's my honor to tell him that his son may have betrayed the Federation.
How well do you know Spock?
I only met him once.
What I know of him comes from history books.
And of course my mind-meld with his father.
Well, that must cover a lot of ground.
Not as much as you'd imagine.
Sarek and Spock...
- Well, sometimes, fathers and sons...
- Oh.
Understood.
Oh, one other thing.
Take a look at this.
Turned up during an intelligence sweep.
- Metal fragments.
- What do you make of it?
Possibly disassembled components identified as Vulcan, recovered from a downed Ferengi vessel?
They were found in crates marked "Medical Supplies."
Contraband?
It has been sent to Vulcan for identification.
Starfleet have requested that we lend a hand.
Mint tea.
It has been years since I've had any.
Vulcans have some kind of strange concoction they call mint.
You'd never recognize it.
Perrin, do you know why I've come to Vulcan?
I must talk to you about Spock.
He didn't even say goodbye to his father before he left.
Is it possible he could have been abducted?
No.
He wrapped up all of his affairs carefully.
He knew he was going.
Do you have any idea why he might have disappeared like this?
Captain, as far as I'm concerned, he disappeared a long time ago.
Would it be inappropriate to ask what happened between you and Spock?
Not between us.
Between Spock and his father.
Oh, they had argued for years.
That was family.
But when the debates over the Cardassian war began, he attacked Sarek's position.
Publicly.
He showed no loyalty for his father.
I was not aware that Sarek was offended by Spock's opposition.
I was offended.
I made sure that Spock knew it.
I'm very protective of my husband.
I do not apologize for it.
Does Sarek have any idea why Spock might have left?
I don't know.
If you could see Sarek as I do, wasting in bed, whispering to himself...
He wants to see his son.
He wants to heal any rift that may still remain.
Now it may be too late.
Perrin, would you allow me to see Sarek?
If it were anyone else, I would never permit it.
But you are a part of him and he of you.
RIKER:
The Vulcans haven't figured out what these fragments are, but they've determined that the metal is a dentarium alloy.
LA FORGE:
Well, that pretty well indicates that they're Vulcan.
And dentarium also means that whatever this was, it was originally designed for use in space.
From the look of the damage, it must have been a high-speed impact.
Yeah, Ferengi cargo ship that went down in the Hanolin asteroid belt.
The debris was spread over a hundred square kilometers.
- Could it be a weapons array?
- My first thought, but the Vulcans have no record of any stolen weapons or stolen parts for that matter.
[SIGHS]
This is gonna be like putting together a big jigsaw puzzle when you don't even know what the picture's supposed to be.
Yep.
[GROANING]
He is like this most of the time.
His emotions have taken over.
Sometimes I can bring him out of it.
- Sarek.
- Unh!
You will listen.
Go from me!
Picard is here.
No more chaos!
No more.
I will leave you alone with him.
He will either acknowledge you or he won't.
Sarek,
I've come a long way to see you.
I will not answer.
I must talk to you about your son.
I wish no one with me.
About Spock.
Spock?
Yes.
He's missing.
Is that you, Picard?
Hello, old friend.
- You're here on Vulcan.
- I need your help.
I must find Spock.
He's not here.
I know.
He's been reported on Romulus.
- Romulus?
- Yes.
Why?
I had hoped to find that out from you.
On Romulus?
You're going there, aren't you?
To find him.
Yes.
Do you have any idea what might have taken him to Romulus?
- No.
- Is there anyone on Romulus he might know or choose to contact?
- Pardek.
- Who is Pardek?
It could be Pardek.
Who is Pardek?
He is a Romulan senator.
Spock has maintained a relationship with him over the years.
I don't know how they met.
At the Khitomer Conference, I'd imagine.
Pardek represented Romulus?
Yes, I'm sure he did.
In fact, I recall Spock coming to me with optimism about maintaining a continual dialogue with the Romulans.
I told him that it was illogical to maintain such an expectation.
Spock was always so impressionable.
This Romulan, Pardek, had no support at home.
Of course, in the end, I was proven correct.
I gave Spock the benefit of experience, of logic.
He never listened.
Never listened.
It has been suggested that Spock might have defected.
Never.
I will accept many things, but never that.
But you believe he might have gone there to see Pardek?
The Romulan senator?
How do you know Pardek?
I've heard of him.
That's what he's done.
He's gone to see Pardek.
Do you know what business they might have together?
No.
No.
I never knew what Spock was doing.
When he was a boy he would disappear for days into the mountains.
I would ask him where he had gone, what he had done.
He refused to tell me.
I insisted that he tell me.
He would not.
I forbade him to go, he ignored me.
I punished him, he endured it.
Silently, but always he returned to the mountains.
One might as well ask the river not to run.
But secretly I admired him, that proud core of him that would not yield.
[PANTING]
Sarek, we're a part of each other.
I know that he has caused you pain.
But I also know that you love him.
Tell him, Picard.
Peace and long life.
Live long and...
And...
Live long and...
[SOBBING]
Spock.
I'm sorry.
And prosper.
PICARD:
Captain's log, stardate 45240.1.
To cross the Neutral Zone, I will require a cloaked ship.
To that end, I have set a course for the Klingon homeworld.
After all we did for Gowron during the recent war,
I'm certain he will be happy to return a favor.
Still no response from the Klingons, Mr. Worf?
- No, sir.
- He's ignoring me.
What other explanation is there?
After hailing him for three days, he could have found a minute to talk.
- Sir.
- Yes, lieutenant?
I believe I know why our messages are not being answered.
Gowron has been rewriting Klingon history.
- Rewriting history?
- Yes.
He is claiming that it was his courage, his genius, that brought an end to the civil war.
I see.
In the new version, there is no mention made of the Federation's help in his rise to power.
If Worf's right, our arrival would be an uncomfortable reminder of the facts.
Well, he can take all the credit he wants, I don't care.
But I do need a ship.
If Gowron won't talk to me, get me somebody who will.
Somebody on the High Council.
K'Tal, perhaps.
- Yes, sir.
DATA:
Captain.
I have a visual identification of Senator Pardek of Romulus.
This is a Barolian record of a trade negotiation in which Pardek participated four years ago.
PICARD:
That's all?
- Yes, sir.
Run it again.
[INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE]
PICARD:
Computer, freeze.
Call up the intelligence scan of Spock on Romulus.
Computer, enhance far-left figure and compare.
[BLEEPING]
Same man.
Pardek.
One question answered.
What do we know of him?
He has been in public service since he was a young man.
A senator for nine decades.
He is considered a man of the people.
He sponsored many reforms.
Reportedly,
Romulan leadership considers him to be somewhat of a radical because he has been an advocate of peace throughout his career.
I can see why Spock would cultivate a relationship with him.
Where would we find him, other than on the floor of the Romulan senate?
The district he represents is called the Krocton Segment.
He maintains a dwelling there.
- Thank you, Mr. Data.
- There is more, sir.
I have taken the liberty of expanding the parameters of my search, and have discovered that Pardek has several relatives in the Krocton Segment.
I believe you will be able to locate him there on the third day of the Romulan week, when the senate is not in session.
[PICARD CHUCKLES]
Mr. Data, your resourcefulness never ceases to amaze me.
[CONSOLE BLEEPING]
- Thank you, sir.
- Captain.
We are being hailed by the Klingon homeworld.
Gowron or K'Tal?
Neither, sir.
It is the junior adjutant to the diplomatic delegation.
Junior adjutant.
Name.
B'iJik, Sir.
On-screen.
B'IJIK:
Greetings, Captain.
I regret to inform you that Gowron and the High Council are quite busy and won't be able to speak with you today.
Is Gowron aware that we have been transmitting messages for the past three days?
Captain, Gowron wishes it were possible to talk with everyone who wants an audience, but he is one man.
The demands on his time are formidable.
If you would like me to take him a message...
A message?
!
Very well.
Tell Gowron, leader of the High Council of the Klingon Empire, that his arbiter of succession, Jean-Luc Picard, needs a favor.
A favor?
PICARD:
I require a cloaked vessel.
[CHUCKLES]
A cloaked vessel is no small favor, Captain.
It is for a mission that could have repercussions throughout the quadrant.
How would it benefit the Klingon Empire?
I'm sure Gowron will ask.
The only benefit to the Klingon Empire would be our gratitude.
That is what you want me to tell him?
PICARD:
Yes.
And please add that if he is unable to provide us with a ship, then I am sure there are others in the Klingon Empire who would be willing to help me.
And then they would have our gratitude.
I see.
Also, please tell Gowron that I am immensely gratified that he is prospering so well.
A tribute to his skilled leadership.
CRUSHER:
They're not removable, are they, Data?
- Removable?
- Your ears.
No, doctor.
They are fully integrated components.
We'll have to do some molds of his ears as well.
What about his skin color?
We'll have to do some tests on his skin pigmentation.
Changing it to appear Romulan shouldn't be too difficult.
We just have to make sure we can change it back again afterwards.
Your right eye is 0.004 higher than your left.
Nobody's perfect, doctor, but...
If you want a proper fit to your prosthetic, trust your tailor.
- Anything from Gowron?
- No, sir, but when you're done with your tailor, join me in the Cargo Bay.
Mr. La Forge has made some progress with the metal fragments.
These two still have an appointment with Mr. Mott to have their hairpieces designed.
Thirty minutes, Number One.
LA FORGE:
What we have here is a navigational deflector array.
Or at least what's left of one.
RIKER:
Who'd want a Vulcan deflector?
LA FORGE:
Beats me, commander.
Every question we answer here seems to bring up two more.
- You're certain this is Vulcan?
- Yes, sir.
Metallurgical analysis confirmed that.
And by running a molecular-pattern trace, we were actually able to identify the ship as the T'Pau.
It was decommissioned years ago and sent to the surplus depot at Qualor ll.
As far as anybody knows, it's still there.
WORF:
Worf to Captain Picard.
- Yes, lieutenant?
A Klingon vessel is decloaking off our port bow.
Compliments of Gowron.
Mr. Worf, will you convey my gratitude to the Captain and advise him that Mr. Data and I will be transporting over shortly?
Aye, sir.
I'd like to take the Enterprise to Qualor II, sir.
- See what's out there.
- Agreed.
Thank you, Mr. La Forge.
I know my duty, Captain.
When I am given orders, I follow them, but I do not like secrets.
I want to know why we are going on this mission.
I'm sorry.
It's a classified matter.
You're going after the defector, aren't you?
Defector?
Do you think information like that stays a secret?
Ambassador Spock has gone to Romulus and you are going after him.
Captain, your orders are to take us to a set of coordinates near Romulus and to bring us back.
And that is all I am prepared to discuss.
If we are discovered by the Romulans, it means death for us all.
I realize that.
[SPEAKS IN KLINGON]
[KLINGON SPEAKS IN KLINGON]
[IN ENGLISH] Very well, Captain.
We have set a course for Romulus.
It may not be what you're used to on a Starfleet ship.
Quite nice.
Thank you.
Captain K'Vada, is this the Captain's quarters or my own?
Both.
We have limited space.
We are a military ship, not a pleasure craft.
Of course.
This will be fine.
You will sleep Klingon-style.
We do not soften our bodies by putting down a pad.
Good.
I prefer it that way.
You will take your meals with us.
But we do not serve Federation food.
I've been looking forward to gagh.
Haven't had it for quite a while.
Very fresh.
[INTERCOM BEEPING]
[KLINGON SPEAKS IN KLINGON ON PA]
[CONVERSING WITH KLINGON IN KLINGON]
[IN ENGLISH] Well, Captain, we are at the border of the Neutral Zone.
You mean to do this, do you?
Yes, I do.
[SPEAKS IN KLINGON]
RIKER:
First officer's log, stardate 45240.6.
The Enterprise is nearing Qualor II, home of a Federation surplus depot operated by the Zakdorn.
We hope to find out how the salvaged deflector array ended up in the hands of the Ferengi.
[CONSOLE BEEPING]
I have made contact, commander.
On-screen.
I'm Commander William Riker from the Federation starship Enterprise.
Klim Dokachin, quartermaster, Surplus Depot Zed-15.
I need some information about a Vulcan ship, the T'Pau.
It was sent to you a few years ago.
Did you arrange an appointment?
An appointment?
No.
Then I will be unable to help you.
You may communicate with Scheduling.
Who does he think he is?
The quartermaster of the supply yard.
With information you need.
Right.
Mr. Worf, reestablish communication.
Aye, sir.
Mr. Dokaychin...
Dokachin.
Klim Dokachin.
Mr. Dokachin, the information I need involves a matter of major importance to the Federation.
I'll need access to your logs, your files.
My people can do the work.
I don't allow outsiders into my computer system.
All right.
One of your people can do the work.
I wish I had the people to spare.
I don't.
Well, sir, what would you suggest?
I don't know.
Contact me when you reach orbit.
I don't believe this.
He's king of his particular hill, commander.
You'll have to treat him that way.
Counselor, this feels like a perfect job for you.
Thank you for coming onboard, Mr. Dokachin.
Quite a ship you have.
We're tied into your computers if you'd like to access the files.
I don't usually see them in such good condition.
By the time they get to me, they're always falling apart.
Mr. Dokachin, we must find this ship and you're the only one who can help us.
Who are you?
Deanna Troi, ship's counselor.
He probably figures that we don't get to see a lot of handsome women out this way and someone like you might get a little more cooperation from me.
He's probably right.
What was the name of that ship?
The T'Pau?
The T'Pau, Vulcan registry.
There.
Logged in stardate 41344.
- Where is the ship now?
- Docked.
Section 18-Gamma-12.
- You want me to take you there?
- I'd appreciate it.
Helmsman, lay in a heading, 141 by 208.
Ahead slow, 200 kph.
- This is your first visit to a junkyard?
- Mm-hm.
You'd be surprised at some of the things
I find onboard these ships.
I once found a 14-foot Caldorian eel onboard a freighter in someone's locker.
Are you serious?
If you have time, I'll show it to you.
I still have it.
Nursed her back to health.
We are approaching the designated coordinates, commander.
On-screen.
What?
Where is it?
What happened to it?
These are the correct coordinates.
- The T'Pau is missing?
- The T'Pau is missing.
How could a ship disappear from your depot?
I'm not accustomed to losing things, commander.
I will find your ship for you.
I have the T'Pau cross-referenced in four different directories.
When it was brought here, was it stripped of material,
- armament, sensors?
- Of course.
Can you tell us what happened to its navigational deflector?
It was routed to the Tripoli, a holding vessel on the outer rim of the shipyard.
It's not there anymore.
What's left of that deflector is laid out on the floor of our cargo bay.
How can that be?
Perhaps we should pay a visit to the Tripoli.
In all the time that the Zakdorn have operated this depot, nothing has ever been lost.
Never.
Approaching the coordinates of the Tripoli.
On-screen.
I do not understand this.
This is not possible.
We beam goods to the Tripoli on a regular schedule.
There was a shipment yesterday.
Another one is set for today.
It must be there.
When is today's transport?
Just over two hours from now.
A shipment of deuterium storage tanks.
Ensign, align the Enterprise so we appear to be one of the abandoned ships.
Mr. La Forge, when we're in position, shut down the engines and all systems except sensors and life support.
Aye, sir.
I have a feeling someone's going to be there to receive those storage tanks.
Be very interested to know who that is.
These quarters were obviously intended for one crewman, sir.
There is but a single sleeping space.
I'm sure the Klingons found it amusing to put us in here together.
Since I do not require sleep, I propose you take the...
Shelf, sir.
I am content to stand.
Very well, Mr. Data.
Thank you.
Are you comfortable, sir?
- I suppose so.
- Good night, Captain.
Sleep well, sir.
Thank you.
What are you doing?
Sir?
Was I making noise, sir?
No, not exactly.
I was processing all of the information we have accumulated on Romulan society.
I am preparing for the task of impersonating a Romulan.
I see.
Would you like me to discontinue, sir?
No.
No, please, go on.
- What are you looking at?
- I am not looking at anything, sir.
I am continuing to organize my files.
But you were looking at me.
I am sorry if I was disturbing you, sir.
I will not look in your direction.
Do you not wish to sleep, sir?
I don't think so, Mr. Data.
- Let's go on with the files.
- I would be happy to.
I have been studying the Krocton Segment as you asked and have chosen the proper site for our transport.
K'VADA [OVER INTERCOM]:
Captain K'Vada to Picard.
Please come to the Bridge.
K'VADA:
Captain.
We've monitored a subspace message that might interest you.
Sarek is dead.
[CONSOLE BEEPING]
Commander, sensors detect a ship approaching at warp speed.
Identification?
Negative.
No transponder signal.
No subspace marker.
Sounds like they don't wanna be identified.
The ship is coming out of warp, sir.
On-screen.
LA FORGE:
Sensors indicate a combat vessel.
Origin, undetermined.
Heavily armed.
Mass and density suggest that it's fully loaded with cargo.
I'd say from these internal scans that a good deal of that cargo is weaponry.
The ship is entering Sector 12-Delta-4.
He's taking the position assigned to the Tripoli.
The coordinates are identical.
Commander, readings indicate surface-to-ship transport has begun.
Mr. La Forge, bring the engines back online
- and restore all systems to normal.
LA FORGE:
Aye, sir.
He's powering up engines, turning to starboard.
- Open a channel.
- Open.
This is Commander William Riker of the USS Enterprise.
Identify yourself.
I repeat, you have entered a Federation depot.
Identify yourself.
Sir, the ship is locking phasers.
Shields up.
Red alert.
That ship easily matches our armament, commander.
It's coming about.
If you do not respond to our hails, we will take that as evidence of hostile action.
There is an energy buildup in their phaser banks.
Sir, they're activating weapons.
[THUMPING]
Forward shields down to 72 percent.
- Boost power to the shields.
LA FORGE:
Aye, sir.
Mr. Worf, lock on to their weapon systems only and prepare to fire.
Forward shields down to 68 percent, aft shields 40 percent.
On my mark, 0.75 burst.
We just wanna get their attention.
Ready, sir.
Fire.
Their forward shields are damaged, sir.
We destroyed one of their phaser arrays.
Looks like collateral damage in the cargo area.
Commander, I'm picking up massive power fluctuations.
Internal explosions.
With all the armament that ship is carrying, it's gonna blow.
PICARD:
Well, Mr. Data, what do you think?
I would not have thought it possible, sir.
I am eager to test the success of our efforts.
It does remain to be seen whether the Romulans will accept us.
Captain, you have seemed unusually pensive since we received the news of Ambassador Sarek's death.
Sarek and I share a particular bond.
Our lives touched in an unusual way.
I admit, I feel the effects of his death.
The tenor of this mission has changed, Mr. Data.
At least it has for me.
We were sent to confront Spock about his disappearance and now I also have to tell him that his father is dead.
I do not entirely understand, sir.
As a Vulcan, Ambassador Spock would simply see death as the logical result of his father's illness.
It's never quite that simple.
Not even for a Vulcan.
Certainly not for Spock, who is half human.
Years spent in conflict and now the chance to resolve those differences is gone.
Considering the exceptionally long lifespan of Vulcans, it does seem odd that Sarek and Spock did not choose to resolve those differences in the time allowed.
Father and son.
Both proud, both stubborn.
More alike than either of them were prepared to admit.
A lifetime spent building emotional barriers.
They're very difficult to break down.
And now the time has come when it's too late.
It's a difficult moment.
It's a lonely one.
It's a moment that Spock is about to face.
[LAUGHING]
Don't you two look sweet.
Be careful, android.
Some Romulan beauty might take a liking to you.
Lick that paint right off your ears.
You.
Do you know what the Romulans will do to you if they discover who you are?
I have a good idea.
We're ready to transport down to the surface.
Just so we understand each other, my orders don't include rescue missions.
[DEVICE BLEEPING]
Senator Pardek.
You received my message.
I got here as quickly as I could, proconsul.
What do you know of this human?
Jean-Luc Picard.
A Starfleet Captain.
I know nothing of him.
Then you haven't seen him recently?
To my knowledge, I have never seen him.
I have received intelligence indicating he's on his way here.
Perhaps here already.
Here on Romulus?
Yes.
Curious, isn't it?
I suppose we'd better find out if the report is accurate or merely rumor.
Circulate his likeness among the security forces.
Remind them that if he is here, he's probably disguised as one of us.
I'll see to it.
This is definitely the street on which the intelligence scan of Spock and Pardek was taken, sir.
Adjusting for the optical distortions,
I am able to verify the architectural features.
Where were they standing?
Data, you're moving about in a very well, android way.
I am sorry, Captain.
I will be more careful.
Don't call me "Captain."
I understand, sir.
I have found the place where they were standing.
- Where?
- It is here.
At this doorway.
A legal intercessor's office.
The name is similar to Pardek's.
It would appear to be one of his relatives.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]
Not open for business yet.
Nonetheless, I recommend we keep this location under observation.
I have clearly determined Pardek's routine.
On days when the senate is not in session, he invariably comes to this section after the median hour.
Very well.
Let's sample the local cuisine, shall we?
[CHATTERING]
Do you happen to know what time the intercessor's office across the way opens?
Why do you wanna know?
I need his services.
He was recommended.
I haven't seen you here before.
We are here for the day.
From the city of Rateg.
Rateg?
I don't think so.
Why do you say that?
You don't sound like you're from Rateg.
It is a misconception that all Rategs speak with a particular inflection.
In fact, there are 12 different...
We come from several kilometers outside the city.
Or perhaps you come from the security forces to watch the intercessor's office.
Is he in trouble?
You're mistaken, madam.
Doesn't matter to me.
I don't know when he opens.
Eat your soup, courtesy of a loyal establishment.
[SPEAKS IN ROMULAN]
I don't think we can stay here too long.
We may not have to.
Direct your view to the far corner, sir.
- Very good, senator.
FEMALE:
Excuse me, senator.
We seem to be having some problems.
Is that not Pardek?
I believe it is.
Perhaps you should appear to enjoy your soup, sir.
I'll take care of that.
Come with me.
- Do not move.
- What?
- Hey, you've made a mistake.
- Quiet.
Come with us.
- Wait here.
- What for?
What have you brought us here for?
PARDEK:
Welcome to Romulus, Captain Picard.
Don't let our soldiers frighten you.
We had to get you off the street as quickly as we could.
Romulan security knows that you're here.
I am Pardek.
You are among friends, Captain.
I have come on an urgent mission from the Federation.
I'm looking for Ambassador Spock.
MALE:
Indeed.
You have found him, Captain Picard.
Captain's Log, Stardate 45233.1.
Our terraforming mission to Doraf I has been canceled and the Enterprise recalled to Starbase 234.
Fleet Admiral Brackett would not discuss the matter on subspace for reasons she said would soon be clear.
I apologize, Captain, for the mystery, but we must attempt to contain the information I'm about to reveal to you at least as long as possible.
I must admit, you've piqued my curiosity, Admiral.
Three weeks ago, one of our most celebrated ambassadors... an advisor to Federation leaders for generations... disappeared.
He left no word of his destination.
Two days ago intelligence reports placed him on Romulus and I assure you, it was an unauthorized visit.
Computer, initiate linkage between this terminal and Starbase computer system alpha-two-nine.
Linkage complete.
A defection?
If it is, the damage to Federation security would be immeasurable.
Taken on Romulus by long-range scanner.
Computer, enhance image in section four-delta.
Space, the final frontier.
These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise.
Its continuing mission... to explore strange new worlds to seek out new life and new civilizations to boldly go where no one has gone before.
Captain's Log, Stardate 45236.4.
As I study the intelligence reports on Ambassador Spock's disappearance
I cannot help but feel a deeper more personal concern about this mission for I know this man through his father.
It was barely a year ago that I shared a mind meld with the Vulcan Sarek.
Now we must meet again as I attempt to find an explanation for his son's actions.
We're coming into orbit of Vulcan in less than an hour, Captain.
We should tell Sarek's wife of our plans.
It's already been taken care of.
She's transporting over at 0700.
And Sarek?
She says he's too ill to make the trip with her.
The man is dying.
And it's my honor to tell him that his son may have betrayed the Federation.
How well do you know Spock?
I only met him once.
What I know of him comes from history books and, of course, my mind meld with his father.
Well, that must cover a lot of ground.
Not as much as you would imagine.
Sarek and Spock...
Well... sometimes fathers and sons...
Oh, understood.
Oh, one other thing.
Take a look at this.
Turned up during an intelligence sweep.
Metal fragments.
What do you make of it?
Possibly disassembled components identified as Vulcan recovered from a downed Ferengi vessel?
They were found in crates marked "medical supplies."
Contraband?
It's been sent to Vulcan for identification.
Starfleet have requested that we lend a hand.
Mint tea.
It's been years since I've had any.
Vulcans have some kind of strange concoction they call mint...
you'd never recognize it.
Perrin, do you know why I've come to Vulcan?
I must talk to you about Spock.
He didn't even say good-bye to his father before he left.
Is it possible he could have been abducted?
No.
He wrapped up all of his affairs carefully.
He knew he was going.
Do you have any idea why he might have disappeared like this?
Captain, as far as I'm concerned he disappeared a long time ago.
Would it be inappropriate to ask what happened between you and Spock?
Not between us.
Between Spock and his father.
Oh, they had argued for years...
that was family... but when the debates over the Cardassian war began he attacked Sarek's position...
publicly.
He showed no loyalty for his father.
I was not aware that Sarek was offended by Spock's opposition.
I was offended.
I made sure that Spock knew it.
I'm very protective of my husband.
I do not apologize for it.
Does Sarek have any idea why Spock might have left?
I don't know.
If you could see Sarek as I do... wasting in bed, whispering to himself...
He wants to see his son.
He wants to heal any... rift that may still remain.
Now it... may be too late.
Perrin... would you allow me to see Sarek?
If it were anyone else I would never permit it but you are a part of him and he of you.
The Vulcans haven't figured out what these fragments are but they've determined that the metal is a dentarium alloy.
Well, that pretty well indicates that they're Vulcan and dentarium also means that whatever this was it was originally designed for use in space.
From the look of the damage it must have been a high-speed impact.
Yeah.
A Ferengi cargo ship that went down in the Hanolin asteroid belt.
The debris was spread over 100 square kilometers.
Could it be a weapons array?
That was my first thought but the Vulcans have no record of any stolen weapons or stolen parts, for that matter.
This is going to be like putting together a big jigsaw puzzle when you don't even know what the picture is supposed to be.
Yup.
He is like this most of the time.
His emotions have taken over.
Sometimes I can bring him out of it.
Sarek!
You will listen.
Go from me!
Picard is here.
No more chaos.
No more.
I will leave you alone with him.
He will either acknowledge you, or he won't.
Sarek.
I've come a long way to see you.
I will not answer.
I must talk to you about your son.
I wish no one with me.
About Spock.
Spock?
Yes.
He's missing.
Is that you?
Picard?
Hello, old friend.
You are here, on Vulcan.
I need your help.
I must find Spock.
He's not here.
I know.
He's been reported on Romulus.
Romulus?
Yes.
Why?
I had hoped to find that out from you.
On Romulus?
You're going there, aren't you?
To find him.
Yes.
Do you have any idea what might have taken him to Romulus?
No.
Is there anyone on Romulus he might know or choose to contact?
Pardek?
Who is Pardek?
It could be Pardek.
Who is Pardek?
He is a Romulan senator.
Spock has maintained a relationship with him over the years.
I don't know how they met.
At the Khitomer Conference, I'd imagine.
Pardek represented Romulus?
Yes.
I'm sure he did.
In fact, I recall Spock coming to me with optimism about maintaining a continual dialogue with the Romulans.
I told him that it was illogical to maintain such an expectation.
Spock was always so impressionable.
This Romulan Pardek had no support at home.
Of course, in the end, I was proven correct.
I gave Spock the benefit of experience, of logic.
He never listened.
Never listened.
It has been suggested that Spock might have defected.
Never.
I will accept many things, but never that.
But you believe he might have gone there to see Pardek.
The Romulan senator?
How do you know Pardek?
I've heard of him.
That's what he's done.
He's gone to see Pardek.
Do you know what business they might have together?
No, no.
I never knew what Spock was doing.
When he was a boy he would disappear for days into the mountains.
I would ask him where he had gone, what he had done.
He refused to tell me.
I insisted that he tell me.
He would not.
I forbade him to go.
He ignored me.
I punished him.
He endured it silently.
But always, he returned to the mountains.
One might as well ask the river not to run.
But secretly, I admired him... the proud core of him that would not yield.
Sarek, we're a part of each other.
I know that he has caused you pain but I also know...
that you love him.
Tell him, Picard...
Peace and long life.
Live long and... and... live long and...
Spock... my son...
And prosper.
Captain's Log, Stardate 45240.1.
To cross the Neutral Zone, I will require a cloaked ship.
To that end, I have set a course for the Klingon Homeworld.
After all we did for Gowron during the recent war
I'm certain he will be happy to return a favor.
Still no response from the Klingons, Mr. Worf?
No, sir.
He's ignoring me.
What other explanation is there?
Well, it seems, after hailing him for three days he could have found a minute to talk to you.
Sir.
Yes, Lieutenant.
I believe I know why our messages are not being answered.
Gowron has been rewriting Klingon history.
Rewriting history?
Yes.
He is claiming that it was his courage his genius that brought an end to the civil war.
I see.
In the new version, there is no mention made of the Federation's help in his rise to power.
If Worf's right, then our arrival will be an uncomfortable reminder of the facts.
Well, he can take all the credit he wants
I don't care, but I do need a ship.
Well, if Gowron won't talk to me, get me somebody who will.
Somebody on the High Council.
K'Tal perhaps.
Yes, sir.
Captain, I have a visual identification of Senator Pardek of Romulus.
This is a Barolian record of a trade negotiation in which Pardek participated four years ago.
That's all?
Yes, sir.
Run it again.
Computer, freeze.
Call up the intelligence scan of Spock on Romulus.
Computer, enhance far left figure and compare.
Same man...
Pardek.
One question answered.
What do we know of him?
He has been in public service since he was a young man.
A senator for nine decades.
He is considered a man of the people.
He has sponsored many reforms.
Reportedly, Romulan leadership considers him to be somewhat of a radical because he has been an advocate of peace throughout his career.
I can see why Spock would cultivate a relationship with him.
Where would we find him other than on the floor of the Romulan Senate?
The district he represents is called the Krocton segment.
He maintains a dwelling there.
Thank you, Mr. Data.
There is more, sir.
I have taken the liberty of expanding the parameters of my search and have discovered that Pardek has several relatives in the Krocton segment.
I believe you will be able to locate him there on the third day of the Romulan week when the Senate is not in session.
Mr. Data, your resourcefulness never ceases to amaze me.
Thank you, sir.
Captain, we are being hailed by the Klingon Homeworld.
Gowron or K'Tal?
Neither, sir.
It is the junior adjutant to the diplomatic delegation.
Junior adjutant.
Name.
B'iJik, sir.
On screen.
Greetings, Captain.
I regret to inform you that Gowron and the High Council are quite busy, and won't be able to speak with you today.
Is Gowron aware that we have been transmitting messages for the past three days?
Captain, Gowron wishes it were possible to talk with everyone who wants an audience but he is one man, the demands on his time are formidable.
If you would like me to take him a message...
A message?
!
Very well.
Tell Gowron, Leader of the High Council of the Klingon Empire that his Arbiter of Succession, Jean-Luc Picard, needs... a favor.
A favor?
I require a cloaked vessel.
A cloaked vessel?
This is no small favor, Captain.
It is for a mission that could have repercussions throughout the quadrant.
How would it benefit the Klingon Empire?
I'm sure Gowron will ask.
The only benefit to the Klingon Empire would be our gratitude.
That is what you want me to tell him?
Yes, and please add that if he is unable to provide us with a ship then I am sure there are others in the Klingon Empire who would be willing to help me and then... they would have our gratitude.
I see.
Also, please tell Gowron that I am immensely gratified that he is prospering so well.
A tribute to his skilled leadership.
They're not removable, are they, Data?
Removable?
Your ears.
No, Doctor, they are fully integrated components.
We'll have to do some molds of his ears as well.
What about his skin color?
We'll have to do some tests on his skin pigmentation.
Changing it to appear Romulan shouldn't be too difficult.
We just have to make sure we can change it back again afterwards.
Your right eye is.004 higher than your left.
Nobody's perfect, Doctor, but...
If you want a proper fit to your prosthetic trust your tailor.
Anything from Gowron?
No, sir, but if, when you're done with your "tailor"
you'd join me in the cargo bay, Mr. La Forge has made some progress with the metal fragments.
These two still have an appointment with Mr. Mot to have their hairpieces designed.
30 minutes, Number One.
What we have here is a navigational deflector array or at least what's left of one.
Who would want a Vulcan deflector?
Beats me, Commander.
Every question we answer here seems to bring up two more.
You're certain this is Vulcan?
Yes, sir.
Metallurgical analysis confirmed that and, by running a molecular pattern trace, we were actually able to identify the ship as... the T'Pau.
It was decommissioned years ago and sent to the surplus depot at Qualor II.
As far as anybody knows, it's still there.
Worf to Captain Picard.
Yes, Lieutenant?
A Klingon vessel is decloaking off our port bow compliments of Gowron.
Mr. Worf, will you convey my gratitude to the Captain and advise him that Mr. Data and I will be transporting over shortly.
Aye, sir.
I'd like to take the Enterprise to Qualor II, sir.
See what's out there.
Agreed.
Thank you, Mr. La Forge.
I know my duty, Captain.
When I am given orders, I follow them but I do not like secrets.
I want to know why we are going on this mission.
I'm sorry.
It's a classified matter.
You're going after the defector, aren't you?
Defector?
Do you think information like that stays a secret?
Ambassador Spock has gone to Romulus and you're going after him.
Captain, your orders are to take us to a set of coordinates near Romulus and to bring us back and that is all I'm prepared to discuss.
If we are discovered by the Romulans it means death for us all.
I realize that.
Hechu' ghos!
Very well, Captain, we have set a course for Romulus.
It may not be what you're used to on a Starfleet ship.
Quite nice.
Thank you.
Captain K'Vada is this the Captain's quarters, or my own?
Both.
We have limited space.
We are a military ship, not a pleasure craft.
Of course.
This will be fine.
You will sleep Klingon-style.
We do not soften our bodies by... putting down a pad.
Good.
I prefer it that way.
You will take your meals with us but we do not serve Federation food.
Ah.
I've been looking forward to gagh.
Haven't had it for quite a while.
Very fresh.
meh HoD.
Jatlh!
MeHmaH ghos.
So'wl'chu'.
Well, Captain, we are at the border of the Neutral Zone.
You mean to do this, do you?
Yes, I do.
Un'ta.
First Officer's Log, Stardate 45240.6.
The Enterprise is nearing Qualor II home of a Federation surplus depot operated by the Zakdorn.
We hope to find out how the salvaged deflector array ended up in the hands of the Ferengi.
I have made contact, Commander.
On screen.
I'm Commander William Riker from the Federation Starship Enterprise.
Klim Dokachin.
Quartermaster, Surplus Depot Zed-One-Five.
I need some information about a Vulcan ship... the T'Pau.
It was sent to you a few years ago.
Did you arrange an appointment?
An appointment?
No.
Then I will be unable to help you.
You may communicate with scheduling.
Who does he think he is?
The quartermaster of the supply yard with information you need.
Right.
Mr. Worf...
reestablish communication.
Aye, sir.
Mr. Dokaychin...
Dok-ah-chin.
Klim Dokachin.
Mr. Dokachin, the information I need involves a matter of major importance to the Federation.
I'll need access to your logs, your files.
My people can do the work.
I don't allow outsiders into my computer system.
All right, one of your people can do the work.
I wish I had the people to spare.
I don't.
Well, sir, what would you suggest?
I don't know.
Contact me when you reach orbit.
I don't believe this.
He's king of his particular hill, Commander.
You'll have to treat him that way.
Counselor, this feels like a perfect job for you.
Thank you for coming on board, Mr. Dokachin.
Quite a ship you have.
We're tied into your computers if you'd like to access the files.
I don't usually see them in such good condition.
By the time they get to me, they're always falling apart.
Mr. Dokachin, we must find this ship and you're the only one who can help us.
Who are you?
Deanna Troi, Ship's Counselor.
He probably figures that we don't get to see a lot of handsome women out this way and someone like you might get a little more cooperation from me.
He's probably right.
What was the name of that ship, the T'Pau?
The T'Pau...
Vulcan registry...
There.
Logged in, Stardate 41344.
Where's the ship now?
Docked... section 18, gamma 12.
You want me to take you there?
I'd appreciate it.
Helmsman, lay in a heading 141 by 208, ahead slow, 200 kph.
I suppose this is your first visit to a junkyard, isn't it?
Mm-hmm.
You'd be surprised at some of the things
I find on board these ships.
I once found a 14-foot Caldorian eel on board a freighter, in someone's locker.
Are you serious?
If you have time, I'll show it to you.
I still have it.
Nursed her back to health.
We are approaching the designated coordinates, Commander.
On screen.
What?
Where is it?
What happened to it?
These are the correct coordinates.
The T'Pau is missing?
The T'Pau... is missing.
How could a ship disappear from your depot?
I'm not accustomed to losing things, Commander.
I will find your ship for you.
I have the T'Pau cross-referenced in four different directories.
When it was brought here, was it stripped of materiel... armament, sensors?
Of course.
Well, can you tell us what happened to its navigational deflector?
It was routed to the Tripoli a holding vessel on the outer rim of the shipyard.
Well, it's not there anymore.
What's left of that deflector is laid out on the floor of our cargo bay.
How can that be?
Perhaps we should pay a visit to the Tripoli.
In all the time that the Zakdorn have operated this depot nothing has ever been lost...
never.
Approaching the coordinates of the Tripoli, sir.
On screen.
I do not understand this.
This is not possible.
We beam goods to the Tripoli on a regular schedule.
There was a shipment yesterday.
Another one is set for today.
It must be there.
When is today's transport?
Just over two hours from now.
A shipment of deuterium storage tanks.
Ensign, align the Enterprise so we appear to be one of the abandoned ships.
Mr. La Forge, when we're in position shut down the engines and all systems except sensors and life support.
Aye, sir.
I have a feeling someone's going to be there to receive those storage tanks.
I'll be very interested to know who that is.
These quarters were obviously intended for one crewman, sir.
There is but a single sleeping space.
I'm sure the Klingons found it amusing to put us in here together.
Since I do not require sleep
I propose you take the... shelf, sir.
I am content to stand.
Very well, Mr. Data.
Thank you.
Are you comfortable, sir?
I suppose so.
Good night, Captain.
Sleep well, sir.
Thank you.
What are you doing?
Sir?
Was I making noise, sir?
No, not exactly.
I was processing all of the information we have accumulated on Romulan society.
I am preparing for the task of impersonating a Romulan.
I see.
Would you like me to discontinue, sir?
No, no.
Please go on.
What are you looking at?
I am not looking at anything, sir.
I am continuing to organize my files.
But you were looking at me.
I am sorry if I was disturbing you, sir.
I will not look in your direction.
Do you not wish to sleep, sir?
I don't think so, Mr. Data.
Let's, uh...
let's go on with the files.
I would be happy to.
I have been studying the Krocton segment as you asked and have chosen the proper site for our transport...
Captain K'Vada to Picard.
Please come to the Bridge.
Captain.
We've monitored a subspace message that might interest you.
Sarek is dead.
Commander, sensors detect a ship approaching at warp speed.
Identification?
Negative.
No transponder signal.
No subspace marker.
Sounds like they don't want to be identified.
The ship is coming out of warp, sir.
On screen.
Sensors indicate a combat vessel.
Origin undetermined.
Heavily armed.
Mass and density suggest that it's fully loaded with cargo.
I'd say, from these internal scans that a good deal of that cargo is weaponry.
The ship is entering sector 12-delta-four.
He's taking the position assigned to the Tripoli.
The coordinates are identical.
Commander, readings indicate surface-to-ship transport has begun.
Mr. La Forge, bring the engines back on line and restore all systems to normal.
Aye, sir.
He's powering up engines.
Turning to starboard.
Open a channel.
Open.
This is Commander William Riker of the USS Enterprise.
Identify yourself.
I repeat, you have entered a Federation depot.
Identify yourself.
Sir, the ship is locking phasers.
Shields up.
Red Alert.
That ship easily matches our armament, Commander.
He's coming about.
If you do not respond to our hails we will take that as evidence of hostile action.
There is an energy buildup in their phaser banks.
Sir, they're activating weapons.
Forward shields down to 72%.
Boost power to the shields.
Aye, sir.
Mr. Worf, lock onto their weapon systems only and prepare to fire.
Forward shields down to 68%, aft shields 40%.
On my mark, a.75 burst.
We just want to get their attention.
Ready, sir.
Fire.
Their forward shields are damaged, sir.
We destroyed one of their phaser arrays.
Looks like collateral damage in the cargo area.
Commander, I'm picking up massive power fluctuations, internal explosions.
With all the armament that ship is carrying it's going to blow.
Well, Mr. Data, what do you think?
I would not have thought it possible, sir.
I am eager to test the success of our efforts.
It does remain to be seen whether the Romulans will accept us.
Captain you've seemed unusually pensive since we received the news of Ambassador Sarek's death.
Sarek and I share a particular bond.
Our lives touched in an unusual way.
I admit I feel the effects of his death.
The tenor of this mission has changed, Mr. Data.
At least, it has for me.
We were sent to confront Spock about his disappearance and now I also have to tell him that his father is dead.
I do not entirely understand, sir.
As a Vulcan, Ambassador Spock would simply see death as the logical result of his father's illness.
It's never quite that simple, not even for a Vulcan.
Certainly not for Spock, who is half human.
Years spent in conflict and now the chance to resolve those differences is gone.
Considering the exceptionally long life span of Vulcans it does seem odd that Sarek and Spock did not choose to resolve those differences in the time allowed.
Father and son...
both proud, both stubborn more alike than either of them were prepared to admit.
A lifetime spent building emotional barriers... they are very difficult to break down and now the time has come when it's too late.
It's a difficult moment.
It's a lonely one.
It's a moment that Spock is about to face.
Don't you two look sweet?
Be careful, android.
Some Romulan beauty might take a liking to you.
Lick that paint right off your ears.
You!
Do you know what the Romulans will do to you if they discover who you are?
I have a good idea.
We're ready to transport down to the surface.
Just so we understand each other my orders don't include rescue missions!
Ah, Senator Pardek.
You received my message.
I got here as quickly as I could, Proconsul.
What do you know of this human...
Jean-Luc Picard, a Starfleet Captain.
I know nothing of him.
Then you haven't seen him recently?
To my knowledge, I have never seen him.
I have received intelligence indicating he is on his way here... perhaps here already.
Here on Romulus?
Yes.
Curious, isn't it?
I suppose we'd better find out if the report is accurate, or merely rumor.
Circulate his likeness among the security forces.
Remind them that if he is here he's probably disguised as one of us.
I'll see to it.
This is definitely the street on which the intelligence scan of Spock and Pardek was taken, sir.
Adjusting for the optical distortions
I am able to verify the architectural features.
Where were they standing?
Data, you're moving about in a very... well, android way.
I am sorry, Captain.
I will be more careful.
Don't call me Captain.
I understand, sir.
I have found the place where they were standing.
Where?
It is here... at this doorway.
A legal intercessor's office.
The name is similar to Pardek's.
It would appear to be one of his relatives.
Not open for business yet.
Nonetheless, I recommend we keep this location under observation.
I have clearly determined Pardek's routine.
On days when the Senate is not in session he invariably comes to this section after the median hour.
Very well.
Let's, um... sample the local cuisine, shall we?
Do you happen to know what time the intercessor's office across the way opens?
Why do you want to know?
I need his services.
He was recommended.
I haven't seen you here before.
We are here for the day from the city of Rateg.
Rateg?
I don't think so.
Why do you say that?
You don't sound like you're from Rateg.
It is a misconception that all Rategs speak with a particular inflection.
In fact, there are 12 different...
We come from several kilometers outside the city.
Or perhaps you come from the security forces to watch the intercessor's office.
Is he in trouble?
You're mistaken, madam.
Doesn't matter to me.
I don't know when he opens.
Eat your soup, courtesy of a loyal establishment.
Jolan true.
I don't think we can stay here too long.
We may not have to.
Direct your view to the far corner, sir.
Very good, Senator.
We seem to be having some problems with the...
Is that not Pardek?
I believe it is.
Perhaps you should appear to enjoy your soup, sir.
I'll take care of that.
Come with me.
Do not move.
What?
You've made a mistake.
Quiet.
Come with us.
Wait here.
What for?
What have you brought us here for?
Welcome to Romulus, Captain Picard.
Don't let our soldiers frighten you.
We had to get you off the street as quickly as we could.
Romulan security knows that you're here.
I am Pardek.
You are among friends, Captain.
I have come on an urgent mission from the Federation.
I'm looking for Ambassador Spock.
Indeed.
You have found him, Captain Picard.
Captain's log, stardate 45233.1.
Our terraforming mission to Doraf I has been cancelled and the Enterprise recalled to Starbase 234.
Fleet Admiral Brackett would not discuss the matter on subspace for reasons she said would soon be clear.
I apologise, Captain, for the mystery, but we must attempt to contain this information at least as long as possible.
I must admit you've piqued my curiosity, Admiral.
Three weeks ago, one of our most celebrated ambassadors, an adviser to Federation leaders for generations, disappeared.
He left no word of his destination.
Two days ago, intelligence reports placed him on Romulus.
I assure you, it was an unauthorised visit.
Computer, initiate linkage with Starbase computer system Alpha 29.
- Linkage complete.
- A defection?
If it is, the damage to Federation security would be immeasurable.
Taken on Romulus by long-range scanner.
Computer, enhance image in section four delta.
Space, the final frontier.
These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise.
Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds to seek out new life and new civilisations to boldly go where no one has gone before.
Captain's log, stardate 45236.4.
As I study the reports on Spock's disappearance,
I cannot help but feel a deeper, more personal concern about this mission, for I know this man through his father.
Barely a year ago, I shared a mind-meld with the Vulcan, Sarek.
Now we must meet again, as I attempt to find an explanation for his son's actions.
We'll reach Vulcan in less than an hour, Captain.
Inform Sarek's wife of our plans.
It's taken care of.
She's transporting over at 0700.
- And Sarek?
- He's too ill to make the trip.
The man is dying.
It's my honour to tell him his son may have betrayed the Federation.
How well do you know Spock?
I only met him once.
What I know is out of history books, and my mind-meld with his father.
That covers a lot of ground.
Not as much as you'd imagine.
Sarek and Spock...
Well, sometimes, fathers and sons...
Understood.
One other thing.
Look at this.
Turned up in an intelligence sweep.
- Metal fragments.
- What do you think?
Possibly components, identified as Vulcan.
From a Ferengi ship?
They were in crates marked "Medical Supplies".
Contraband.
It's been sent to Vulcan for identification.
Starfleet have requested that we lend a hand.
Mint tea.
It's been years since I've had any.
Vulcans have some strange concoction they call mint.
You'd never recognise it.
Perrin, do you know why I've come to Vulcan?
I must talk to you about Spock.
He didn't even say goodbye to his father before he left.
Is it possible he could have been abducted?
No!
He wrapped up all his affairs carefully.
He knew he was going.
Do you have any idea why he might have disappeared like this?
Captain, as far as I'm concerned, he disappeared a long time ago.
Is it inappropriate to ask what happened between you?
Not between us.
Between Spock and his father.
They had argued for years.
That was family.
But when the debates over the Cardassian War began, he attacked Sarek's position.
Publicly.
He showed no loyalty for his father.
I was not aware Sarek was offended by Spock's opposition.
I was offended.
I made sure that Spock knew it.
I'm very protective of my husband.
I do not apologise for it.
Does Sarek have any idea why Spock might have left?
I don't know.
If you could see Sarek as I do, wasting in bed, whispering to himself...
He wants to see his son.
He wants to heal any rift that may still remain.
Now, it may be too late.
Perrin, would you allow me to see Sarek?
If it were anyone else, I would never permit it.
But you are a part of him, and he of you.
The Vulcans can't identify the fragments, but they've determined the metal is a dentarium alloy.
That indicates they're Vulcan.
It also means that whatever this was, it was designed for use in space.
From the damage, it was a high-speed impact.
A Ferengi ship went down in the Hanolin asteroid belt.
Debris covered 100 square kilometres.
- Is it a weapons array?
- I thought so.
But the Vulcans have no record of stolen weapons or parts.
This is going to be like doing a jigsaw puzzle with no idea what the picture should be.
Yep.
He is like this most of the time.
His emotions have taken over.
Sometimes, I can bring him out of it.
Sarek!
You will listen.
Go from me.
Picard is here.
No more chaos!
No more.
I will leave you alone with him.
He will either acknowledge you or he won't.
Sarek!
I've come a long way to see you.
I will not answer.
- I must talk to you about your son.
- I wish no one with me.
About Spock.
Spock?
Yes.
He's missing.
Is that you?
Picard?
Hello, old friend.
- You're here, on Vulcan.
- I need your help.
I must find Spock.
- He's not here.
- I know.
He's been reported on Romulus.
- Romulus?
- Yes.
- Why?
- I hoped to find that out from you.
On Romulus.
You're going there, aren't you?
- To find him.
- Yes.
Do you have any idea what might have taken him to Romulus?
No.
Is there anyone on Romulus he might know or choose to contact?
Pardek?
Who is Pardek?
It could be Pardek.
Who is Pardek?
He is a Romulan senator.
Spock has maintained a relationship with him.
I don't know how they met.
At the Khitomer conference, I'd imagine.
- Pardek represented Romulus?
- Yes.
I'm sure he did.
In fact, I recall Spock coming to me with optimism about maintaining a continual dialogue with the Romulans.
I told him it was illogical to maintain such an expectation.
Spock was always so impressionable.
This Romulan, Pardek, had no support at home.
Of course, in the end, I was proven correct.
I gave Spock the benefit of experience, of logic.
He never listened.
Never listened.
It has been suggested that Spock might have defected.
Never.
I will accept many things, but never that.
But you believe he might have gone to see Pardek?
The Romulan senator?
How do you know Pardek?
I've heard of him.
That's what he's done.
He's gone to see Pardek.
Do you know what business they may have?
No, I never knew what Spock was doing.
As a boy, he would disappear into the mountains.
I would ask what he'd done.
He refused to tell me.
I insisted that he tell me.
He would not.
I forbade him to go.
He ignored me.
I punished him.
He endured it, silently.
But always he returned to the mountains.
One might as well ask the river not to run.
But secretly, I admired him, the proud core of him that would not yield.
Sarek.
We're a part of each other.
I know that he has caused you pain.
But I also know that you love him.
Tell him, Picard.
Peace and long life.
Live long and...
Live long and...
Spock.
My son.
And prosper.
Captain's log, stardate 45240.1.
To cross the Neutral Zone, I require a cloaked ship.
To that end, I have set a course for the Klingon Homeworld.
After all we did for Gowron in the recent war, I'm certain he'll be happy to return a favour.
- Still no reply from the Klingons?
- No, sir.
He's ignoring me.
He has to be.
After three days, he could find a minute for you.
- Sir.
- Yes, Lieutenant?
I believe I know why our messages are not being answered.
Gowron has been rewriting history.
Rewriting history?
He is claiming it was his courage, his genius, that ended the civil war.
I see.
The new version makes no mention of the Federation's help in his rise to power.
If Worf's right, we'll be an uncomfortable reminder.
He can take all the credit, I don't care.
But I do need a ship.
If Gowron won't talk to me, get me someone on the High Council.
K'tal?
- Yes, sir.
- Captain.
I have a visual identification of Senator Pardek of Romulus.
This is a Barolian record of a trade negotiation in which Pardek participated four years ago.
- That's all?
- Yes.
Run it again.
Computer, freeze.
Call up the intelligence scan of Spock on Romulus.
Computer, enhance far left figure and compare.
Same man.
Pardek.
One question answered.
What do we know of him?
He has been in public service since his youth, a senator for nine decades.
He is considered a man of the people.
He has sponsored many reforms.
Reportedly, Romulan leadership considers him to be a radical.
He has advocated peace throughout his career.
I can see why Spock would cultivate a relationship with him.
Where would we find him, other than at the Romulan Senate?
He represents the Krocton segment.
He maintains a dwelling there.
- Thank you, Mr Data.
- There is more, sir.
I took the liberty of expanding my search and found that Pardek has several relatives in the Krocton segment.
You can locate him there, on the third day of the week when the Senate is not in session.
Mr Data, your resourcefulness never ceases to amaze me.
Thank you, sir.
Captain, we are being hailed by the Klingon Homeworld.
Gowron or K'tal?
Neither, sir.
The junior adjutant to the diplomatic delegation.
Junior adjutant!
Name?
B'iJik, sir.
- On screen.
- Greetings, Captain.
I regret that Gowron and the High Council are too busy to talk to you.
Is Gowron aware that we have been transmitting messages for three days?
Gowron wishes he could talk with everyone who wants an audience, but the demands on his time are formidable.
- If you would leave a message?
- A message?
Very well.
Tell Gowron, leader of the High Council of the Klingon Empire, that his Arbiter of Succession, Jean-Luc Picard, needs a favour.
A favour?
I require a cloaked vessel.
A cloaked vessel?
This is no small favour, Captain.
Our mission could have repercussions for the whole quadrant.
How would it benefit the Klingon Empire?
I'm sure Gowron will ask.
The only benefit to the Klingon Empire would be our gratitude.
- You want me to tell him that?
- Yes.
And please add that if he is unable to provide us with a ship, then I am sure there are others in the Klingon Empire who would be willing to help me.
And then, they would have our gratitude.
I see.
Also, please tell Gowron that I am immensely gratified that he is prospering so well.
A tribute to his skilled leadership.
They're not removable, are they?
- Removable?
- Your ears.
No, Doctor.
They are fully integrated components.
- We'll need moulds of his ears.
- And his skin colour?
We'll need some tests on his skin pigmentation.
Making it look Romulan won't be difficult.
We just have to make sure we can change it back again.
Your right eye is.004 higher than your left.
Nobody's perfect.
But...
If you want a proper fit to your prosthetic, trust your tailor.
- Anything from Gowron?
- No, sir.
But Mr La Forge has made progress with the metal fragments.
These two still have an appointment to have their hairpieces designed.
30 minutes, Number One.
What we have is a navigational deflector array.
- Or what's left of one.
- Who would want a Vulcan deflector?
Beats me.
Every question we answer brings up two more.
- Are you certain it's Vulcan?
- Metallurgical analysis confirms it.
And a molecular pattern trace has identified the ship as T'Pau.
Decommissioned years ago and sent to the surplus depot at Qualor II.
It's meant to still be there.
- Worf to Capt Picard.
- Yes, Lieutenant?
A Klingon vessel is decloaking off our port bow, compliments of Gowron.
Mr Worf, convey my gratitude to the Captain and advise him that Mr Data and I will be transporting over shortly.
I'd like to go to Qualor Il, sir.
See what's out there.
Agreed.
Thank you, Mr La Forge.
I know my duty, Captain.
When I am given orders, I follow them, but I do not like secrets.
I want to know why we are going on this mission.
I'm sorry.
It's a classified matter.
You're going after the defector, aren't you?
Defector?
Do you think information like that stays a secret?
Ambassador Spock has gone to Romulus and you are going after him.
Captain, your orders are to take us to Romulus and to bring us back.
That is all I will discuss.
If we are discovered by the Romulans, it means death for us all.
I realise that.
Very well, Captain.
We have set a course for Romulus.
It may not be what you're used to on a Starfleet ship.
Quite nice.
Thank you.
Capt K'Vada, is this the Captain's quarters, or my own?
Both.
We have limited space.
We are a military ship, not a pleasure craft.
Of course.
This will be fine.
You will sleep Klingon-style.
We do not soften our bodies by putting down a pad.
Good!
I prefer it that way.
You will take meals with us.
But we do not serve Federation food.
I've been looking forward to gagh.
Haven't had it for ages.
Very fresh.
Well, Captain, we're at the border of the Neutral Zone.
You mean to do this, do you?
Yes, I do.
First Officer's log, stardate 45240.6.
We are nearing Qualor Il, home of a Federation surplus depot operated by the Zakdorn.
We hope to find out how the salvaged deflector array ended up in the hands of the Ferengi.
- I've made contact, Commander.
- On screen.
I'm Cmdr William Riker of the Starship Enterprise.
Klim Dokachin,
Quartermaster, Surplus Depot Z-15.
I need information on a Vulcan ship, the T'Pau.
- You got it a few years ago.
- Did you arrange an appointment?
An appointment?
No.
Then I will be unable to help you.
You may communicate with Scheduling.
Who does he think he is?
The Quartermaster of the supply yard, with information you need.
Right.
Mr Worf, re-establish communication.
Aye, sir.
Mr Dokaychin?
Dokachin.
Klim Dokachin.
Mr Dokachin, the information I need is of major importance to the Federation.
I need access to logs and files.
My people can do the work.
I don't allow outsiders into my computer system.
Alright.
One of your people can do the work.
I wish I had the people to spare.
I don't.
Well, sir, what would you suggest?
I don't know.
Contact me when you reach orbit.
I don't believe this!
He's king of his particular hill, Commander.
You have to treat him that way.
Counsellor, this feels like a perfect job for you.
Thank you for coming on board, Mr Dokachin.
Quite a ship you have.
We're linked to your computer if you could access the files.
I don't usually see them in such good condition.
By the time they get to me, they're always falling apart.
We must find this ship and you're the only one who can help us.
- Who are you?
- Deanna Troi, ship's Counsellor.
He must figure we don't get to see a lot of handsome women out here, and someone like you might get a little more cooperation from me.
He's probably right.
What was the name of that ship?
The T'Pau?
The T'Pau.
Vulcan registry.
There.
Logged in stardate 41344.
- Where's the ship now?
- Docked.
Section 18, gamma 12.
- Want me to take you there?
- I'd appreciate it.
Helmsman, lay in a heading 141 by 208, ahead slow, 200kph.
I suppose this is your first visit to a junkyard, isn't it?
You'd be surprised at some of the things I find on board these ships!
I once found a 14-foot Caldorian eel on board a freighter, in someone's locker.
Are you serious?
If there's time, I'll show it to you.
I still have it.
Nursed her back to health.
We are approaching the coordinates.
On screen.
What?
Where is it?
What happened to it?
- These are the coordinates.
- The T'Pau is missing?
The T'Pau is missing!
How can a ship disappear from your depot?
I am not used to losing things.
I will find your ship for you.
The T'Pau is cross-referenced in four directories.
When it arrived, was it stripped of armaments, sensors?
Of course.
Can you tell us what happened to its navigational deflector?
It went to the Tripoli, a holding vessel on the rim of the shipyard.
It's not there any more.
What's left of it is in our cargo bay.
- How can that be?
- Maybe we should visit the Tripoli.
In all the time that the Zakdorn have operated this depot, nothing has ever been lost.
Never.
- Approaching the coordinates, sir.
- On screen.
I do not understand this.
This is not possible!
We beam goods to the Tripoli on a regular schedule.
We made a shipment yesterday.
Another is set for today.
It must be there.
- When is today's transport?
- Just over two hours from now.
A shipment of deuterium storage tanks.
Ensign, align the Enterprise like an abandoned ship.
Mr La Forge, when we're in position, shut down the engines and all systems except sensors and life support.
Someone will be here to receive those storage tanks.
I'd be interested to know who that is.
These quarters were intended for one, with but a single sleeping space.
I'm sure the Klingons found it amusing to put us here together.
Since I do not require sleep,
I propose you take the shelf, sir.
I am content to stand.
Very well, Mr Data, thank you.
- Are you comfortable, sir?
- I suppose so.
Goodnight, Captain.
Sleep well, sir.
Thank you.
- What are you doing?
- Sir?
Was I making noise, sir?
No, not exactly.
I was processing the information we accumulated on Romulan society.
I am preparing to impersonate a Romulan.
I see.
- Shall I discontinue, sir?
- No, please, go on.
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing, sir.
- I am organising my files.
- But you were looking at me.
I am sorry if I was disturbing you.
I will not look in your direction.
Do you not wish to sleep, sir?
I don't think so, Mr Data.
Let's go on with the files.
I'd be happy to.
I have studied the Krocton segment, as asked, and have chosen a site for transport.
Capt K'Vada to Picard.
Please come to the bridge.
Captain.
We've monitored a subspace message that might interest you.
Sarek is dead.
Commander, sensors detect a ship approaching at warp speed.
Identification?
Negative.
No transponder signal, no subspace marker.
They don't want to be identified.
- It's coming out of warp, sir.
- On screen.
Sensors indicate a combat vessel, origin undetermined, heavily armed.
Mass and density suggest that it's fully loaded with cargo.
From these scans, a good deal of that cargo is weaponry.
The ship is entering sector 12, delta 4.
He's taking the position assigned to the Tripoli.
The coordinates are identical.
Readings show surface-to-ship transport has begun.
Bring the engines back on line and restore all systems to normal.
He's powering up, turning to starboard.
- Open a channel.
- Open.
This is Cmdr William Riker of the USS Enterprise.
Identify yourself.
I repeat, you have entered a Federation depot.
Identify yourself.
The ship is locking phasers.
Shields up.
Red alert.
- They easily match our armament.
- It's coming about.
If you do not respond, we will take that as hostile action.
There's an energy build-up in their phaser banks.
Sir, they're activating weapons.
- Forward shields at 72 percent.
- Boost power to the shields.
Mr Worf, lock on to their weapons systems only and prepare to fire.
Forward shields down to 68 percent.
Aft shields, 40 percent.
On my mark, .75 burst.
We just want to get their attention.
- Ready, sir.
- Fire.
Their forward shields are damaged.
We destroyed one of their phaser arrays.
There's collateral damage in the cargo area.
I'm picking up massive power fluctuations, internal explosions.
With all those armaments, that ship will blow.
Well, Mr Data, what do you think?
I would not have thought it possible, sir.
I am eager to test the success of our efforts.
It does remain to be seen whether the Romulans will accept us.
Captain, you have seemed unusually pensive since we received the news of Ambassador Sarek's death.
Sarek and I share a particular bond.
Our lives touched in an unusual way.
I admit I feel the effects of his death.
The tenor of this mission has changed, at least for me.
We were sent to confront Spock about his disappearance.
Now I also have to tell him that his father is dead.
I do not entirely understand, sir.
As a Vulcan, Ambassador Spock would simply see death as the logical result of his father's illness.
It's never quite that simple, not even for a Vulcan.
Certainly not for Spock, who is half-human.
Years spent in conflict.
And now the chance to resolve those differences is gone.
Considering the long life span of Vulcans, it does seem odd they chose not to resolve those differences in the time allowed.
Father and son.
Both proud, stubborn, more alike than either is prepared to admit.
A lifetime spent building emotional barriers.
They're very difficult to break down.
And now the time has come when it's too late.
It's a difficult moment.
It's a lonely one.
It's a moment that Spock is about to face.
Don't you two look sweet?
Be careful, Android.
Some Romulan beauty might take a liking to you.
Lick that paint right off your ears.
You!
Do you know what the Romulans will do to you if they discover who you are?
I have a good idea.
We're ready to transport to the surface.
Just so we understand each other, my orders don't include rescue missions!
Senator Pardek.
You received my message.
I got here as quickly as I could, Proconsul.
What do you know of this human?
Jean-Luc Picard, a Starfleet captain.
- I know nothing of him.
- You haven't seen him recently?
To my knowledge, I have never seen him.
I have received intelligence indicating he's on his way here, perhaps here already.
Here on Romulus?
Yes.
Curious, isn't it?
We'd better find out if the report is accurate or merely rumour.
Circulate his likeness to the security forces.
Remind them that he's probably disguised as one of us.
I'll see to it.
This is the street where the scan of Spock and Pardek was taken, sir.
Allowing for distortions, I can verify the architectural features.
Where were they standing?
Data, you're moving about in a very, well, android way.
I am sorry, Captain.
I will be more careful.
Don't call me Captain.
I understand, sir.
I have found the place where they were standing.
- Where?
- It is here.
At this doorway.
A legal intercessor's office.
The name is similar to Pardek's.
It would appear to be a relative.
Not open for business yet.
Nonetheless, I recommend we keep this location under observation.
I determined Pardek's routine.
When the Senate is not in session, he invariably comes to this section after the median hour.
Very well.
Let's sample the local cuisine, shall we?
Do you know what time the intercessor's office opens?
Why do you want to know?
I need his services.
He was recommended.
I haven't seen you here before.
We're here for the day, from the city of Rateg.
- Rateg?
I don't think so!
- Why do you say that?
You don't sound like it.
It is a misconception that all Rategs have the same inflection.
In fact...
We come from several kilometres outside the city.
Or from the security forces to watch the intercessor's office?
- Is he in trouble?
- You are mistaken, madam.
Doesn't matter to me.
I don't know when he opens.
Eat your soup, courtesy of a loyal establishment.
Jolan true.
I don't think we can stay here too long.
We may not have to.
Direct your view to the far corner, sir.
Very good, Senator.
Senator.
We seem to be having some problems...
- Is that not Pardek?
- I believe it is.
Perhaps you should appear to enjoy your soup, sir.
I'll take care of that.
Come.
- Do not move!
- What?
You've made a mistake.
Quiet!
Come with us.
Wait here.
What for?
What have you brought us here for?
Welcome to Romulus, Capt Picard.
Don't let our soldiers frighten you.
We had to get you off the street as quickly as we could.
Romulan Security knows that you're here.
I am Pardek.
You are among friends, Captain.
I have come on an urgent mission from the Federation.
- I'm looking for Ambassador Spock.
- Indeed.
You have found him, Capt Picard.
Captain's log, stardate 45233.1.
Our terraforming mission to Doraf I has been cancelled and the Enterprise recalled to Starbase 234.
Fleet Admiral Brackett would not discuss the matter on subspace for reasons she said would soon be clear.
I apologise, Captain, for the mystery, but we must attempt to contain this information at least as long as possible.
I must admit you've piqued my curiosity, Admiral.
Three weeks ago, one of our most celebrated ambassadors, an adviser to Federation leaders for generations, disappeared.
He left no word of his destination.
Two days ago, intelligence reports placed him on Romulus.
I assure you, it was an unauthorised visit.
Computer, initiate linkage with Starbase computer system Alpha 29.
- Linkage complete.
- A defection?
If it is, the damage to Federation security would be immeasurable.
Taken on Romulus by long-range scanner.
Computer, enhance image in section four delta.
Space, the final frontier.
These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise.
Its continuing mission, to explore strange new worlds to seek out new life and new civilisations to boldly go where no one has gone before.
Captain's log, stardate 45236.4.
As I study the reports on Spock's disappearance,
I cannot help but feel a deeper, more personal concern about this mission, for I know this man through his father.
Barely a year ago, I shared a mind-meld with the Vulcan, Sarek.
Now we must meet again, as I attempt to find an explanation for his son's actions.
We'll reach Vulcan in less than an hour, Captain.
Inform Sarek's wife of our plans.
It's taken care of.
She's transporting over at 0700.
- And Sarek?
- He's too ill to make the trip.
The man is dying.
It's my honour to tell him his son may have betrayed the Federation.
How well do you know Spock?
I only met him once.
What I know is out of history books, and my mind-meld with his father.
That covers a lot of ground.
Not as much as you'd imagine.
Sarek and Spock...
Well, sometimes, fathers and sons...
Understood.
One other thing.
Look at this.
Turned up in an intelligence sweep.
- Metal fragments.
- What do you think?
Possibly components, identified as Vulcan.
From a Ferengi ship?
They were in crates marked "Medical Supplies".
Contraband.
It's been sent to Vulcan for identification.
Starfleet have requested that we lend a hand.
Mint tea.
It's been years since I've had any.
Vulcans have some strange concoction they call mint.
You'd never recognise it.
Perrin, do you know why I've come to Vulcan?
I must talk to you about Spock.
He didn't even say goodbye to his father before he left.
Is it possible he could have been abducted?
No!
He wrapped up all his affairs carefully.
He knew he was going.
Do you have any idea why he might have disappeared like this?
Captain, as far as I'm concerned, he disappeared a long time ago.
Is it inappropriate to ask what happened between you?
Not between us.
Between Spock and his father.
They had argued for years.
That was family.
But when the debates over the Cardassian War began, he attacked Sarek's position.
Publicly.
He showed no loyalty for his father.
I was not aware Sarek was offended by Spock's opposition.
I was offended.
I made sure that Spock knew it.
I'm very protective of my husband.
I do not apologise for it.
Does Sarek have any idea why Spock might have left?
I don't know.
If you could see Sarek as I do, wasting in bed, whispering to himself...
He wants to see his son.
He wants to heal any rift that may still remain.
Now, it may be too late.
Perrin, would you allow me to see Sarek?
If it were anyone else, I would never permit it.
But you are a part of him, and he of you.
The Vulcans can't identify the fragments, but they've determined the metal is a dentarium alloy.
That indicates they're Vulcan.
It also means that whatever this was, it was designed for use in space.
From the damage, it was a high-speed impact.
A Ferengi ship went down in the Hanolin asteroid belt.
Debris covered 100 square kilometres.
- Is it a weapons array?
- I thought so.
But the Vulcans have no record of stolen weapons or parts.
This is going to be like doing a jigsaw puzzle with no idea what the picture should be.
Yep.
He is like this most of the time.
His emotions have taken over.
Sometimes, I can bring him out of it.
Sarek!
You will listen.
Go from me.
Picard is here.
No more chaos!
No more.
I will leave you alone with him.
He will either acknowledge you or he won't.
Sarek!
I've come a long way to see you.
I will not answer.
- I must talk to you about your son.
- I wish no one with me.
About Spock.
Spock?
Yes.
He's missing.
Is that you?
Picard?
Hello, old friend.
- You're here, on Vulcan.
- I need your help.
I must find Spock.
- He's not here.
- I know.
He's been reported on Romulus.
- Romulus?
- Yes.
- Why?
- I hoped to find that out from you.
On Romulus.
You're going there, aren't you?
- To find him.
- Yes.
Do you have any idea what might have taken him to Romulus?
No.
Is there anyone on Romulus he might know or choose to contact?
Pardek?
Who is Pardek?
It could be Pardek.
Who is Pardek?
He is a Romulan senator.
Spock has maintained a relationship with him.
I don't know how they met.
At the Khitomer conference, I'd imagine.
- Pardek represented Romulus?
- Yes.
I'm sure he did.
In fact, I recall Spock coming to me with optimism about maintaining a continual dialogue with the Romulans.
I told him it was illogical to maintain such an expectation.
Spock was always so impressionable.
This Romulan, Pardek, had no support at home.
Of course, in the end, I was proven correct.
I gave Spock the benefit of experience, of logic.
He never listened.
Never listened.
It has been suggested that Spock might have defected.
Never.
I will accept many things, but never that.
But you believe he might have gone to see Pardek?
The Romulan senator?
How do you know Pardek?
I've heard of him.
That's what he's done.
He's gone to see Pardek.
Do you know what business they may have?
No, I never knew what Spock was doing.
As a boy, he would disappear into the mountains.
I would ask what he'd done.
He refused to tell me.
I insisted that he tell me.
He would not.
I forbade him to go.
He ignored me.
I punished him.
He endured it, silently.
But always he returned to the mountains.
One might as well ask the river not to run.
But secretly, I admired him, the proud core of him that would not yield.
Sarek.
We're a part of each other.
I know that he has caused you pain.
But I also know that you love him.
Tell him, Picard.
Peace and long life.
Live long and...
Live long and...
Spock.
My son.
And prosper.
Captain's log, stardate 45240.1.
To cross the Neutral Zone, I require a cloaked ship.
To that end, I have set a course for the Klingon Homeworld.
After all we did for Gowron in the recent war, I'm certain he'll be happy to return a favour.
- Still no reply from the Klingons?
- No, sir.
He's ignoring me.
He has to be.
After three days, he could find a minute for you.
- Sir.
- Yes, Lieutenant?
I believe I know why our messages are not being answered.
Gowron has been rewriting history.
Rewriting history?
He is claiming it was his courage, his genius, that ended the civil war.
I see.
The new version makes no mention of the Federation's help in his rise to power.
If Worf's right, we'll be an uncomfortable reminder.
He can take all the credit, I don't care.
But I do need a ship.
If Gowron won't talk to me, get me someone on the High Council.
K'tal?
- Yes, sir.
- Captain.
I have a visual identification of Senator Pardek of Romulus.
This is a Barolian record of a trade negotiation in which Pardek participated four years ago.
- That's all?
- Yes.
Run it again.
Computer, freeze.
Call up the intelligence scan of Spock on Romulus.
Computer, enhance far left figure and compare.
Same man.
Pardek.
One question answered.
What do we know of him?
He has been in public service since his youth, a senator for nine decades.
He is considered a man of the people.
He has sponsored many reforms.
Reportedly, Romulan leadership considers him to be a radical.
He has advocated peace throughout his career.
I can see why Spock would cultivate a relationship with him.
Where would we find him, other than at the Romulan Senate?
He represents the Krocton segment.
He maintains a dwelling there.
- Thank you, Mr Data.
- There is more, sir.
I took the liberty of expanding my search and found that Pardek has several relatives in the Krocton segment.
You can locate him there, on the third day of the week when the Senate is not in session.
Mr Data, your resourcefulness never ceases to amaze me.
Thank you, sir.
Captain, we are being hailed by the Klingon Homeworld.
Gowron or K'tal?
Neither, sir.
The junior adjutant to the diplomatic delegation.
Junior adjutant!
Name?
B'iJik, sir.
- On screen.
- Greetings, Captain.
I regret that Gowron and the High Council are too busy to talk to you.
Is Gowron aware that we have been transmitting messages for three days?
Gowron wishes he could talk with everyone who wants an audience, but the demands on his time are formidable.
- If you would leave a message?
- A message?
Very well.
Tell Gowron, leader of the High Council of the Klingon Empire, that his Arbiter of Succession, Jean-Luc Picard, needs a favour.
A favour?
I require a cloaked vessel.
A cloaked vessel?
This is no small favour, Captain.
Our mission could have repercussions for the whole quadrant.
How would it benefit the Klingon Empire?
I'm sure Gowron will ask.
The only benefit to the Klingon Empire would be our gratitude.
- You want me to tell him that?
- Yes.
And please add that if he is unable to provide us with a ship, then I am sure there are others in the Klingon Empire who would be willing to help me.
And then, they would have our gratitude.
I see.
Also, please tell Gowron that I am immensely gratified that he is prospering so well.
A tribute to his skilled leadership.
They're not removable, are they?
- Removable?
- Your ears.
No, Doctor.
They are fully integrated components.
- We'll need moulds of his ears.
- And his skin colour?
We'll need some tests on his skin pigmentation.
Making it look Romulan won't be difficult.
We just have to make sure we can change it back again.
Your right eye is.004 higher than your left.
Nobody's perfect.
But...
If you want a proper fit to your prosthetic, trust your tailor.
- Anything from Gowron?
- No, sir.
But Mr La Forge has made progress with the metal fragments.
These two still have an appointment to have their hairpieces designed.
30 minutes, Number One.
What we have is a navigational deflector array.
- Or what's left of one.
- Who would want a Vulcan deflector?
Beats me.
Every question we answer brings up two more.
- Are you certain it's Vulcan?
- Metallurgical analysis confirms it.
And a molecular pattern trace has identified the ship as T'Pau.
Decommissioned years ago and sent to the surplus depot at Qualor II.
It's meant to still be there.
- Worf to Capt Picard.
- Yes, Lieutenant?
A Klingon vessel is decloaking off our port bow, compliments of Gowron.
Mr Worf, convey my gratitude to the Captain and advise him that Mr Data and I will be transporting over shortly.
I'd like to go to Qualor Il, sir.
See what's out there.
Agreed.
Thank you, Mr La Forge.
I know my duty, Captain.
When I am given orders, I follow them, but I do not like secrets.
I want to know why we are going on this mission.
I'm sorry.
It's a classified matter.
You're going after the defector, aren't you?
Defector?
Do you think information like that stays a secret?
Ambassador Spock has gone to Romulus and you are going after him.
Captain, your orders are to take us to Romulus and to bring us back.
That is all I will discuss.
If we are discovered by the Romulans, it means death for us all.
I realise that.
Very well, Captain.
We have set a course for Romulus.
It may not be what you're used to on a Starfleet ship.
Quite nice.
Thank you.
Capt K'Vada, is this the Captain's quarters, or my own?
Both.
We have limited space.
We are a military ship, not a pleasure craft.
Of course.
This will be fine.
You will sleep Klingon-style.
We do not soften our bodies by putting down a pad.
Good!
I prefer it that way.
You will take meals with us.
But we do not serve Federation food.
I've been looking forward to gagh.
Haven't had it for ages.
Very fresh.
Well, Captain, we're at the border of the Neutral Zone.
You mean to do this, do you?
Yes, I do.
First Officer's log, stardate 45240.6.
We are nearing Qualor Il, home of a Federation surplus depot operated by the Zakdorn.
We hope to find out how the salvaged deflector array ended up in the hands of the Ferengi.
- I've made contact, Commander.
- On screen.
I'm Cmdr William Riker of the Starship Enterprise.
Klim Dokachin,
Quartermaster, Surplus Depot Z-15.
I need information on a Vulcan ship, the T'Pau.
- You got it a few years ago.
- Did you arrange an appointment?
An appointment?
No.
Then I will be unable to help you.
You may communicate with Scheduling.
Who does he think he is?
The Quartermaster of the supply yard, with information you need.
Right.
Mr Worf, re-establish communication.
Aye, sir.
Mr Dokaychin?
Dokachin.
Klim Dokachin.
Mr Dokachin, the information I need is of major importance to the Federation.
I need access to logs and files.
My people can do the work.
I don't allow outsiders into my computer system.
Alright.
One of your people can do the work.
I wish I had the people to spare.
I don't.
Well, sir, what would you suggest?
I don't know.
Contact me when you reach orbit.
I don't believe this!
He's king of his particular hill, Commander.
You have to treat him that way.
Counsellor, this feels like a perfect job for you.
Thank you for coming on board, Mr Dokachin.
Quite a ship you have.
We're linked to your computer if you could access the files.
I don't usually see them in such good condition.
By the time they get to me, they're always falling apart.
We must find this ship and you're the only one who can help us.
- Who are you?
- Deanna Troi, ship's Counsellor.
He must figure we don't get to see a lot of handsome women out here, and someone like you might get a little more cooperation from me.
He's probably right.
What was the name of that ship?
The T'Pau?
The T'Pau.
Vulcan registry.
There.
Logged in stardate 41344.
- Where's the ship now?
- Docked.
Section 18, gamma 12.
- Want me to take you there?
- I'd appreciate it.

I suppose this is your first visit to a junkyard, isn't it?
You'd be surprised at some of the things I find on board these ships!
I once found a 14-foot Caldorian eel on board a freighter, in someone's locker.
Are you serious?
If there's time, I'll show it to you.
I still have it.
Nursed her back to health.
We are approaching the coordinates.
On screen.
What?
Where is it?
What happened to it?
- These are the coordinates.
- The T'Pau is missing?
The T'Pau is missing!
How can a ship disappear from your depot?
I am not used to losing things.
I will find your ship for you.
The T'Pau is cross-referenced in four directories.
When it arrived, was it stripped of armaments, sensors?
Of course.
Can you tell us what happened to its navigational deflector?
It went to the Tripoli, a holding vessel on the rim of the shipyard.
It's not there any more.
What's left of it is in our cargo bay.
- How can that be?
- Maybe we should visit the Tripoli.
In all the time that the Zakdorn have operated this depot, nothing has ever been lost.
Never.
- Approaching the coordinates, sir.
- On screen.
I do not understand this.
This is not possible!
We beam goods to the Tripoli on a regular schedule.
We made a shipment yesterday.
Another is set for today.
It must be there.
- When is today's transport?
- Just over two hours from now.
A shipment of deuterium storage tanks.
Ensign, align the Enterprise like an abandoned ship.
Mr La Forge, when we're in position, shut down the engines and all systems except sensors and life support.
Someone will be here to receive those storage tanks.
I'd be interested to know who that is.
These quarters were intended for one, with but a single sleeping space.
I'm sure the Klingons found it amusing to put us here together.

No, not exactly.

- Shall I discontinue, sir?
- No, please, go on.
- What are you looking at?
- Nothing, sir.
- I am organising my files.
- But you were looking at me.
I am sorry if I was disturbing you.
I will not look in your direction.
Do you not wish to sleep, sir?
I don't think so, Mr Data.
Let's go on with the files.
I'd be happy to.
I have studied the Krocton segment, as asked, and have chosen a site for transport.
Capt K'Vada to Picard.
Please come to the bridge.
Captain.
We've monitored a subspace message that might interest you.
Sarek is dead.
Commander, sensors detect a ship approaching at warp speed.
Identification?
Negative.
No transponder signal, no subspace marker.
They don't want to be identified.
- It's coming out of warp, sir.
- On screen.
Sensors indicate a combat vessel, origin undetermined, heavily armed.
Mass and density suggest that it's fully loaded with cargo.
From these scans, a good deal of that cargo is weaponry.
The ship is entering sector 12, delta 4.
He's taking the position assigned to the Tripoli.
The coordinates are identical.
Readings show surface-to-ship transport has begun.
Bring the engines back on line and restore all systems to normal.
He's powering up, turning to starboard.
- Open a channel.
- Open.
This is Cmdr William Riker of the USS Enterprise.
Identify yourself.
I repeat, you have entered a Federation depot.
Identify yourself.
The ship is locking phasers.
Shields up.
Red alert.
- They easily match our armament.
- It's coming about.
If you do not respond, we will take that as hostile action.
There's an energy build-up in their phaser banks.
Sir, they're activating weapons.
- Forward shields at 72 percent.
- Boost power to the shields.
Mr Worf, lock on to their weapons systems only and prepare to fire.
Forward shields down to 68 percent.
Aft shields, 40 percent.
On my mark, .75 burst.
We just want to get their attention.
- Ready, sir.
- Fire.
Their forward shields are damaged.
We destroyed one of their phaser arrays.
There's collateral damage in the cargo area.
I'm picking up massive power fluctuations, internal explosions.
With all those armaments, that ship will blow.
Well, Mr Data, what do you think?
I would not have thought it possible, sir.
I am eager to test the success of our efforts.
It does remain to be seen whether the Romulans will accept us.
Captain, you have seemed unusually pensive since we received the news of Ambassador Sarek's death.
Sarek and I share a particular bond.
Our lives touched in an unusual way.
I admit I feel the effects of his death.
The tenor of this mission has changed, at least for me.
We were sent to confront Spock about his disappearance.
Now I also have to tell him that his father is dead.
I do not entirely understand, sir.
As a Vulcan, Ambassador Spock would simply see death as the logical result of his father's illness.
It's never quite that simple, not even for a Vulcan.
Certainly not for Spock, who is half-human.
Years spent in conflict.
And now the chance to resolve those differences is gone.
Considering the long life span of Vulcans, it does seem odd they chose not to resolve those differences in the time allowed.
Father and son.
Both proud, stubborn, more alike than either is prepared to admit.
A lifetime spent building emotional barriers.
They're very difficult to break down.
And now the time has come when it's too late.
It's a difficult moment.
It's a lonely one.
It's a moment that Spock is about to face.
Don't you two look sweet?
Be careful, Android.
Some Romulan beauty might take a liking to you.
Lick that paint right off your ears.
You!
Do you know what the Romulans will do to you if they discover who you are?
I have a good idea.
We're ready to transport to the surface.
Just so we understand each other, my orders don't include rescue missions!
Senator Pardek.
You received my message.
I got here as quickly as I could, Proconsul.
What do you know of this human?
Jean-Luc Picard, a Starfleet captain.
- I know nothing of him.
- You haven't seen him recently?
To my knowledge, I have never seen him.
I have received intelligence indicating he's on his way here, perhaps here already.
Here on Romulus?
Yes.
Curious, isn't it?
We'd better find out if the report is accurate or merely rumour.
Circulate his likeness to the security forces.
Remind them that he's probably disguised as one of us.
I'll see to it.
This is the street where the scan of Spock and Pardek was taken, sir.
Allowing for distortions, I can verify the architectural features.
Where were they standing?
Data, you're moving about in a very, well, android way.
I am sorry, Captain.
I will be more careful.
Don't call me Captain.
I understand, sir.
I have found the place where they were standing.
- Where?
- It is here.
At this doorway.
A legal intercessor's office.
The name is similar to Pardek's.
It would appear to be a relative.
Not open for business yet.
Nonetheless, I recommend we keep this location under observation.
I determined Pardek's routine.
When the Senate is not in session, he invariably comes to this section after the median hour.
Very well.
Let's sample the local cuisine, shall we?
Do you know what time the intercessor's office opens?
Why do you want to know?
I need his services.
He was recommended.
I haven't seen you here before.
We're here for the day, from the city of Rateg.
- Rateg?
I don't think so!
- Why do you say that?
You don't sound like it.
It is a misconception that all Rategs have the same inflection.
In fact...
We come from several kilometres outside the city.
Or from the security forces to watch the intercessor's office?
- Is he in trouble?
- You are mistaken, madam.
Doesn't matter to me.
I don't know when he opens.
Eat your soup, courtesy of a loyal establishment.
Jolan true.
I don't think we can stay here too long.
We may not have to.
Direct your view to the far corner, sir.
Very good, Senator.
Senator.
We seem to be having some problems...
- Is that not Pardek?
- I believe it is.
Perhaps you should appear to enjoy your soup, sir.
I'll take care of that.
Come.
- Do not move!
- What?
You've made a mistake.
Quiet!
Come with us.
Wait here.
What for?
What have you brought us here for?
Welcome to Romulus, Capt Picard.
Don't let our soldiers frighten you.
We had to get you off the street as quickly as we could.
Romulan Security knows that you're here.
I am Pardek.
You are among friends, Captain.
I have come on an urgent mission from the Federation.
- I'm looking for Ambassador Spock.
- Indeed.
You have found him, Capt Picard.

Oh, morning, Ma.
How'd you sleep?
Pretty good.
I dreamed I was making love to Jay Leno.
That's a strange dream for you to have.
Not really.
It was Monday night, and he was filling in for Carson.
Mornin', all.
Oh, Blanche, honey, how was your date last night?
Oh, unforgettable.
Mel Bushman and I were coming back from a champagne picnic at Sunset Beach.
We ran out of gas in the middle of nowhere.
Oh, my goodness!
What did you do?
You name it.
Blanche, you got a call last night from something called the Maltese Falcon Club.
Oh, good.
Remember I was asked to select the activity for the museum staff's annual outing?
Yesterday, I signed us up for a murder-mystery weekend at the Queen of the Keys Hotel.
You mean, the kind of thing where mock murders are committed and then the guests try to solve them?
Exactly.
Mmm-hmm.That sounds like fun.
You know, back in Minnesota,
I was known as the Sherlock Holmes of St. Olaf.
Figured out which one was Shinola, did you, Rose?
The hard way.
I sure hope this weekend is a success.
It could give me a shot at becoming
Kendall Nesbitt's new assistant.
Who's Kendall Nesbitt?
Oh, he's the museum's director of acquisitions.
If I got this job, it would mean going to Europe with him to look for rare paintings and antiques.
Well, if he has an eye for antiques, you should be a shoo-in.
(LAUGHING SARCASTICALLY)
Look who's calling the vase Ming.
There's just one hitch.
I need three more people to get the group rate at the hotel.
I thought hotels always gave you the group rate.
Yeah, sweetheart, but this is for the whole night.
Is there any chance I could persuade you girls to join me for a murder-mystery weekend?
Blanche, are you kidding?
I have read every word
Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler ever wrote.
Now, Sam Spade and Philip Marlowe have become a part of me.
"She had more curves than the Monaco Grand Prix
"and was twice as dangerous.
"Her jewelry was mute testimony
"that Charlie Chaplin wasn't the only tramp
"who hit it big in this town."
You do this on first dates, don't you, Dorothy?
Does this mean you'll go?
Of course we'll go.
Sure, anything for a friend.
What the heck.
I'll go, too.
Yeah, like you had a choice.
When do you think the mysteries are gonna start?
You want a mystery?
You should have tried the pink dressing at the salad bar.
Oh, jeez, the mystery continues.
Now, girls, remember, look everyone over very carefully.
Try to figure out who are the real guests and who are actors pretending to be guests.
It'll help when it comes to solving the mysteries.
Okay, Dorothy.
If that's your real name.
How is that coffee?
Terrific!
Actor.
Blanche, you're wearing my earrings.
Oh, I know that.
But when I asked you before where they were, you said you didn't know, and now you're wearing them.
Well, Rose, there could be two explanations.
Either I was lying, or I was wrong about the number of explanations.
Blanche.
Oh, Kendall.
Blanche, I must commend you again.
I have a feeling we're in for a weekend none of us is going to forget.
Oh, I do declare, your sweet words could charm the mornin' dew right off of the honeysuckle.
(KENDALL LAUGHING)
That was good, Blanche.
Now, do Br'er Rabbit.
I believe the fun is about to begin.
Ladies.
I think I got to him, don't you?
Your eyes are as good as rolled back.
I do believe that things are gonna turn out even better than I...
Oh, Kendall is sitting down with Posey MacGlinn.
She is my main rival for that assistant's job.
Oh, look at the shameless way she's flirting' with him.
Disgustin'.
You flirted with him.
I'm from the South.
Flirting is part of my heritage.
What do you mean?
Her mother was a slut, too.
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm sure we all join his son, his daughter and his new bride, Candy, in wishing many returns of the day to our friend and patron for 40 years,
Giles Forsythe.
(GUN FIRING)
(WOMAN SCREAMING)
(GASPING)
My God!
They've been murdered!
Does this mean we don't get any birthday cake?
Please, nobody touch anything.
My name is Spade Marlowe.
I'm a private detective retained by the late philanthropist, Giles Forsythe, because when an 88-year-old man marries a 22-year-old girl, he likes to know what she's up to.
I'm sorry to interrupt, but does anybody but me think the hat's a little precious?
(WHISTLING)
Today was Giles Forsythe's birthday, and he intended as always to celebrate by having dinner here with his son, Philip, a well-known collector of pre-Columbian artifacts, his spinster daughter, Gloria, and of course his new bride, Candy.
I've failed to protect my client, but I am determined, with your help, to solve these crimes and bring the murderer to justice.
Maybe that bloody dagger will lead us to the murder weapon.
St. Olaf?
Boy, he is good.
Unusual knife.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, cut the cake.
I recognize that.
It's a rare Mayan sacrificial dagger.
That could prove to be significant.
Undoubtedly the weapon used to kill Mrs. Forsythe, but obviously her husband was shot.
Then there must be a gun.
South side?
Uncanny.
Do you mind?
Go right ahead.
You won't find anything.
What I believe they refer to as a purse gun, and it's been recently fired.
I don't understand.
Ladies and gentlemen, you now have enough clues to solve these murders.
Who did it, how and why?
The butler did it!
I'm a maitre d'.
Thank you.
The maitre d' did it!
Philip did it!
Gloria did it!
It was Colonel Mustard in the library with the candlestick.
Oh, she says, "The butler did it," and I'm the idiot?
The answer is obvious.
They both did it.
Oh, now, if Miss Smarty solves the crime, she'll make a big impression on Kendall, and I can just kiss that job goodbye.
Philip was a collector of pre-Columbian relics.
Candy had her throat cut with a Mayan dagger.
He killed her.
The gun was in Gloria's purse.
She killed her father.
Nice try, ma' am, but Philip and Gloria are innocent of those crimes.
Perhaps, but they are both murderers.
Sit down, Dorothy.
Don't make a fool of yourself.
Would you care to explain?
In the first place, it is unlikely that Gloria murdered her father.
Statistics show that patricide is overwhelmingly a male crime.
Although daughters frequently murder their mothers!
If Gloria had killed her father, would she then have tried to conceal the weapon in her purse?
Ladies and gentlemen, I think not.
That gun was obviously planted in her purse to pin the murder on her.
I've got it!
A maitre d' is some kind of waiter.
On the other hand, Philip would never pick a Mayan sacrificial knife as a murder weapon.
Too obvious.
But it would be no problem for his sister to sneak the weapon out of his collection.
This woman's pathetic!
Oh, big news.
Tear out the front page.
Notice that the dagger was found to the left of the victim.
A throat...
A throat is almost always cut from behind.
Not part of the show, people.
Not part of the show.
Being right-handed, I would slash from left to right.
But from the fact that the murder weapon was dropped to the left of the victim, we can deduce that the murderer is left-handed.
Notice that Gloria, like most left-handed people, wears her wristwatch on her right wrist.
I think it is painfully clear that Philip and Gloria both planned murders, and each meant to pin it on the other.
They knew that the lights would be turned off when the cake appeared because that happens every year.
Coincidence?
Ha!
Siblings often think alike.
You've given us a who, a how and a "Ha."
But what about why?
What's the motive?
When a 22-year-old marries an 88-year-old, chances are she's not after his body.
Oh, boy.
Gloria and Philip were both afraid that Candy would persuade the old man to change his will, and they both hoped that pinning the crime on the other would make them the sole inheritor.
Well, there you have it, ladies and gentlemen, the who, how and why.
Dorothy, that was a real Tour de France.
Thank you, thank you, Rose.
Girls, guess what?
Kendall just told me he needs to be alone with me.
What did you do?
Well, what else?
I gave him my key to our room.
Now, let me have yours, Rose.
You can bunk with Dorothy and Sophia tonight.
But we were gonna be roomies.
Either you're bunking' with them, or you can sleep in the closet.
Closet?
Give me that key.
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)
Coming, Kendall.
Oh.
Compliments of Mr. Nesbitt.
Well, how sweet.
I'll take it.
No, no, no.
I've got it, ma'am.
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!
(GASPING)
It's all right.
What is this all about?
He's dead!
Blanche, calm down.
This is undoubtedly just another part of the mystery weekend.
Oh, yeah?
He looks pretty dead to me.
All right, Ma, give me your mirror.
What for?
Every morning I hold it under Ma's nose.
If it fogs up, I start the coffee.
No breath.
Oh, my God.
He's dead.
Oh, God.
I'm Vaczy, hotel security.
Nobody touch anything.
You say no one was in the room but her and the victim?
That's right, sir.
He's dead, all right.
Steak knife right through the heart.
That must be what killed him.
St. Olaf?
It's like I'm wearing a sign.
I want everybody out of this room.
I'm clearing it till the police get here.
And nobody leaves the hotel, especially you.
As of now, you're the only suspect.
If they put me in prison, I'll be brave.
I can handle it.
Blanche, you don't understand.
They'll put you in a women's prison.
(BLANCHE GASPING)
Don't let me go, Dorothy!
Don't let me go!
Honey, you are not going to go because you are not guilty.
I understand you can have anything for your last meal.
Just ice cream, if you want.
I think I'm gonna be sick.
You're not helping, Rose.
It's almost as though you believe Blanche is guilty.
Well, she lied about my earrings, and she took them.
I mean, deceit, then theft.
Isn't murder the next logical step?
St. Olaf, right?
Face it, Dorothy.
Blanche was discovered in a locked room.
Only she and the victim had keys.
I mean, give me another explanation.
The trouble is, I can't.
Oh, come on, pussycat.
You figured out that mystery at dinner.
Oh, Ma, that was a game.
This is life.
Oh, that's right.
You've never been good at life.
How can I be accused of murder?
I am a Devereaux.
Things like this usually happen to people named Petrillo.
I take offense at that.
No one in my family ever, ever left a body to be found.
Okay, I'm Lieutenant Alvarez, Dade County Homicide, and here's what I got.
At around 9:45 last night, this guy went to Room 405, carrying champagne ordered by Nesbitt.
He was admitted by Blanche Devereaux and discovered the corpse.
Now, Ms. Devereaux and this dead guy had the only two keys.
Forensics say that the cause of death was a stab wound inflicted by a steak knife.
We know Ms. Devereaux had steak for dinner.
Given these facts, unless somebody has something else, we got enough to make an arrest.
My, my, Mr. Officer.
I do declare, your sweet words could charm the mornin' dew right off the honeysuckle.
Blanche, not now.
If not now, when?
Blanche Devereaux...
Wait, wait!
You haven't established a motive.
You want a motive?
I'll give you a motive.
That woman gave Kendall her room key.
I saw her do it.
Her plan was to seduce him to insure that she would win the job as his assistant.
Then she got the other key to the room from that woman there.
She--She rushed up to the room.
She tore off her clothes.
That's Velcro.
It just gives the illusion of a tear.
She flung her dress on the bed.
She slipped into a negligee and awaited her prey.
What she didn't realize was the reason that Kendall went to her room, the reason Kendall ordered the champagne, was to let her down easy.
He'd already promised the job to me.
And the reason he went to her room, rather than having her come to his, was that I was sharing his room.
Slut!
When Kendall told her the truth, she flew into a jealous rage.
She plunged the steak knife into his chest.
That tramp murdered my lover!
I know Blanche Devereaux, Lieutenant, and this tramp is incapable of committing murder.
Okay, we got a motive, we got a weapon, and we got one suspect with no alibi.
Blanche Devereaux, I'm charging you with murder.
You have the right to remain...
Wait, wait!
Why would she bring a steak knife to what she thought was a romantic liaison?
It could've been for anything.
I'm not familiar with her sexual proclivities.
What, are you a rookie?
You still haven't answered the question of how somebody else got into the room.
What if there was a knock at the door?
Nesbitt might have assumed that it was the waiter with the champagne.
That is speculation.
But one more point.
The hotel security chief cordoned off the room, so the only people who saw the room after the murder, other than you and your staff, were the waiter, the security chief, and the four of us.
So?
So when Miss MacGlinn was reconstructing the murder scene, she described Blanche's dress being slung over the bed.
It was.
I saw it.
But Miss MacGlinn could only have seen it if she'd been there prior to the murder.
(BLANCHE GASPING)
I think I see now how it happened.
Last evening, at dinner, when Miss MacGlinn saw Blanche give Kendall Nesbitt her key, she was furious.
She dropped a steak knife into her purse.
Big deal, I took a whole place setting.
Not now, Ma!
And when she felt that she wouldn't be missed, she slipped out of the dining room and headed upstairs.
Kendall had let himself into Blanche's room while she was in the shower and was making himself comfortable when there was a knock at the door.
Thinking it was the champagne, he opened the door.
Posey was there.
She accused him of two-timing.
He denied it.
Posey pulled out a steak knife, plunged it into his chest and left the room before Blanche could discover her.
Jealous rage was the motive, all right, but Blanche wasn't the murderer.
There's your murderer, Posey MacGlinn.
Well, Miss MacGlinn, what do you have to say now?
Dorothy Zbornak, you've stuck your nose in for the last time!
(DOROTHY SCREAMING)
(GUN FIRING)
(GRUNTING)
Posey MacGlinn,
I charge you with the murder of Kendall Nesbitt.
Lieutenant Alvarez, I don't think that'll be necessary, as I seem to have recovered from my death, but I would like to thank the Maltese Falcon Club and, in particular, Blanche Devereaux for giving us a weekend we'll never forget.
Thank you for coming.
So wait a minute.
You mean those guys were all in on it?
I was in on it, too.
Oh, come on, you were not.
Oh, all right.
I was not.
Damn it, I just hate to be the brunt of jokes.
Funny, you don't mind being the brunt of limericks.
That's different.
That's poetry.
Wait a minute.
There's one thing I don't understand.
When I checked to make sure that Kendall was really dead, why didn't his breath show up on your mirror?
Simple.
The mirror had been sprayed with defogger.
But who could have done that?
I did.
The people at the club asked me to.
Well, Rose, why would you do such a cruel thing to me?
Well, Blanche, there could be two explanations.
Either I was getting back at you for taking my earrings or...
Oh, who are we kidding?
That's why I did it.
This whole thing is just unbelievable.
Kendall, you're not dead, and I didn't kill anybody.
And I didn't take any silverware.
Does this mean I'm still in the runnin' for the job?
Of course you are.
Oh, well...
So this was all a mockery, a sham.
No crimes were committed at all.
What a load of fun.
Pussycat, help me carry my purse to the car.

-Lisa, can I see you?
-Yes!
Yes?
Your homework is always so neat.
Does your father help you?
-Homework's not his specialty.
-It's okay.
My dad couId--
-Not mine.
-Let me finish.
unless the next word was "burp," don't bother.
In a sample taken in our classroom...
... aninspectorfound1.7 4 parts per million of asbestos!
That's not enough!
We demand more asbestos!
More asbestos!
More asbestos!
More asbestos!
-You made the front page.
-It's just a popularity contest.
"Just a popularity contest"?
What's more important than popularity?
-Bart, can you really win?
-Sure, why not?
I knew you had personality!
They said it was hyperactivity, but I knew better!
President Simpson.
Has a nice ring to it, doesn't it, boy?
-Yeah.
-Now, go get them!
He says, there are no easy answers!
I say, he's not looking hard enough!
You never lose appealing to the lowest common denominator.
-You'II miss Bart.
-When?
When your life takes you places.
places where my intelligence will be an asset?
Yes, there is such a place.
believe me.
I believe everything you say, with your words and Semitic good looks.
"Dear Miss Hoover:
You have Lyme disease.
We miss you.

Here's a drawing of a spirochete.

Oh, that's great, ralph!
The springfield Museum of natural History...
... willbeclosingdownintwoweeks.
Go see it while you can.
Lisa needs to go to the museum, and I think you should take her.
The museum?
Tomorrow?
Oh, Marge, I'd love to, but I was planning on...
HOMER:
Sleeping?
Eating a big sandwich?
Spending time with the boy!
... spendingtimewiththe boy .
-I'm concerned about you and Lisa.
-Me too.
They're drifting apart.
-Shut up, boy.
-Homer, please.
You don't understand.
I can't--
You're trapped.
You're not smart enough to get out of this.
AII right!
I'II take her!
Lousy brain.
-What's a "suggested donation"?
-Pay what you wish.
-And what if I wish to pay zero?
-It's up to you.
-So it's up to me, is it?
-Yes.
And you think that people are gonna pay you $4.50...
... whentheydon'thaveto, out of the goodness of their... .
Anything you say!
Good luck, lady!
You'II need it!
-Mr.
Bergstrom!
-Hi, Lisa.
-Hey!
You don't have to pay!
-This must be your father.
His teeth were jagged, but he could swallow you whole.
Wow!
actually, they do know a great deal about mummification.
First, they pulled the brain out and stuffed the skull with onions.
Gross!
Creepy.
But I'd rather have him after me than the wolf Man.
Oh, Lord.
I've noticed that Lisa seems to feel she has no strong male role model.
-She said that?
-No, but, you know, she--
But you can tell, right?
She sees everybody else's dad...
... witha goodeducationand says, "What did I do to deserve this?"
You must be a bigger man.
There's a wonderful girl's future at stake.
-If she's so great, give her an A.
-I am.
-Great.
tell her she earned it.
-She did earn it.
You are smooth.
I'II give you that.
He ruined my chance to get to know Mr. Bergstrom outside school.
I'II tell you what, why don't we invite him to dinner?
Oh, Mom, that's wonderful!
-Can I help cook?
-Yes.
-Can I wear jewelry?
-Sure.
Dye my shoes?
Paint my nails?
Can we have wine?
Can I have wine?
Does Bart have to be there?
We request the pleasure of your company-
- No.
If you're not doing anything this Friday-
- No.
Mr. Bergstrom, do you Iike pork chops?
Oh, no, of course not.
Good morning, Lisa.
I'm back.
My Lyme disease turned out to be...
-... psychosomatic.
-Does that mean you're crazy?
-It means she was faking.
-It was a little of both.
Sometimes when a disease is on the news, it's natural to think you have it.
-Where's Mr. Bergstrom?
-Don't know.
But I'd Iike to talk to him.
He didn't use my lesson plan.
-What did he teach you?
-That life is worth living.
The polls are open till the end of recess.
In case any of you have thought about this...
... we'IIhearfinalstatements.
Martin?
I don't think there's anything left to say.
-Bart?
-Victory party under the slide!
Mr. Bergstrom!
Mr. Bergstrom!
He moved out this morning.
He took his Copernicus costume.
Where is he?
He's taking the train to capital City.
The train.
How like him.
traditional, yet environmentally sound.
Yes.
And it's been the backbone of our country...
... sinceStanforddrovein that golden spike.
I see he touched you too.
-Thanks for your vote.
-Voting's for geeks!
You got that right.
-Thanks for your vote.
-We forgot.
Oh, well, as long as a couple of people did.
Right, MiIhouse?
Lewis?
-Somebody must have voted.
-What about you?
Didn't you vote?
Uh-oh.
[BELL RINGS]
I demand a re-count.
Two for Martin.
Want another re-count?
-No.
-I want to make sure.
One for Martin, two for Martin.
This way, Mr. President!
CONDUCTOR:

Mr. Bergstrom!
Hey, Lisa.
-Hey, Lisa, indeed!
-What?
What is it?
Were you just gonna leave, just like that?
I'm sorry, Lisa.
It's the life of the substitute teacher.
He's a fraud.
Today he wears gym shorts, tomorrow he speaks French...
... orrunsabandsaw or God knows what.
You're the best teacher I'II ever have.
-That's not true.
Others will come.
-Oh, please!
You're right, I'm the best.
But they need me over in capital City.
But I need you too.
When you're middIe-cIass...

Goodbye, Lisa, honey!
It'II be okay.
Just read the note!
HOMER:
Bart didn't get one vote?
This is the worst thing that could happen!
AII right, spilled milk.
What are you so mopey about?
-Nothing.
-Lisa, tell your father.
-Mr.
Bergstrom left.
-Oh?
-He's gone.
Forever.
-And?
I didn't think you'd understand.
Just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't understand.
I'm glad I'm not crying.
I'd hate for you to think that what I'm gonna say is based on emotion.
But you, sir, are a baboon!
-Me?
-Yes, you!
Baboon!
Baboon!
Baboon!
-You don't realize what you're saying.
-Baboon!
Someone was bound to say it, but I never expected her.
Did you hear that?
She called me a baboon!
The stupidest and ugliest ape of all!
You're not allowed to be hurt now.
A little girl needs you.
Her confidence in you is shaken...
... andnolittlegirlcanbehappy without faith in her daddy.
HOMER:
"Go away. "
Lisa, don't hold anything back.
You can tell me.
-You're sad you called me a baboon?
-No!
Nuts.
This isn't going well at all.
-If you want me to forgive--
-No, I just wish I knew what to say.
But maybe this music will help.
Now, you lost someone special and it hurt.
I never lost anyone special to me.
Everyone special to me is under this roof.
It's true.
Now, you'II have lots of special people in your life.
There's probably a place they hang out...
... andthefoodisgood , and guys like me are serving drinks.
Maybe I can't explain all this, but I can fix your dollhouse.
At least I'm good at monkey work.
You know, monkey?
You know what I mean?
I can hold these nails in place with my tail.
[HOOTS LIKE A BABOON]
-You're so silly.
-Give me a banana.
-I don't have any.
-You're holding out on me.
-I'm sorry I called you a baboon.
-Think nothing of it.
President Prince, President Princess, President Priss... .
Hey, what's the matter, son?
Oh, Dad.
If just me, MiIhouse and Lewis had voted.
would you have gotten any money for being class president?
-No.
-would you have more work?
Yeah.
Is Martin gonna get to do anything neat...
... likeplayin theworldSeries?
-No.
-So, Iet the baby have his bottle.
That's my motto.
Hey, thanks, monkey-man.
holy moly, talk about parenting.
[STARTS TO CRY]
Uh-oh.
sleep well, Maggie.
Three for three.
-Did you straighten everything--?
-Don't say anything, Marge.
Let's just go to bed.
I'm on the biggest roll of my Iife.

Hear about Miss Hoover?
She drank some drain cleaner.
I heard she fell down a well.
Come on, now.
She's been dumped again.
I won't be staying long.
I just learned I have Lyme disease.
Principal Skinner will stay until a sub comes.
-What's Lyme disease?
-I know.
Lyme disease is spread by ticks.
When a tick begins to suck your blood spirochetes infest your blood and spinal fluid and then the brain.
The brain.
Oh, dear God!
Come on, Elizabeth.
Well, now, children, here we are.
Open your primers to page 32.
Ah, subtraction!
Bart Simpson, I know it's you!
And here comes Snowball II.
We kept this one.
The mother ate the gray one.
Mrs. Krabappel, he's traumatizing us.
I agree.
Bart, shut that off and sit down.
Look, this is cool.
When I hit reverse, I can make them go back in.
No, you're not seeing things.
This, my little friends, is a schwa.
-Are you the substitute?
-I am.
-Are you insane?
-It's how I get their attention.
All right.
Play friendly with your new teacher, children.
Howdy.
I'm a Texas cowboy from 1830.
-Ask me anything you like.
-Can we play kickball?
Kickball?
There ain't no kickball in 1830.
Any other questions?
Shoot!
It's awfully quiet.
Well, how about this?
I want to see both eyes up here.
There are three things wrong with my costume.
Name them and you get my hat.
-I know the answer.
-What's your name?
-Lisa Simpson.
-Well, go ahead.
Your belt says "State of Texas, " but it wasn't a state until 1845.
Very good.
-The revolver wasn't around till 1835.
-Excellent.
You seem to be Jewish.
-You sure?
-Italian?
-Jewish.
-Cowboys aren't Jewish.
Good!
I also have a digital watch, but I'll accept that.
For the record, there were some Jewish cowboys.
Big guys who spent money freely.
I'm Mr. Bergstrom.
You can make fun of my name.
Two suggestions are Mr. Nerd-strom and Mr. Booger-strom.
Today we will begin selecting a class president.
I can't vote, but I suggest Martin.
Martin?
As president, I would demand a science fiction library featuring an ABC of the overlords of the genre:
-Asimov, Bester, Clarke--
-What about Bradbury?
I'm aware of his work.
Thank you, and keep watching the skies.
Excellent!
Excellent, Martin!
If you're through with your pemmican, why don't we sing a song?
This one's not very accurate, but we'll fix it.
Okay?
Actually, the range was far from home.
It was a desolate place of danger and disease.
Unlike the efficient Indians cowboys used only the tongue of the antelope.
What's this?
Did you do it?
No!
I would never do anything like that.
It was one of those immature--
-Can I have it?
-Yes, but I didn't do it.
-Are you sure you didn't?
It's good.
-I wish I had.
Class, "The Singing Dork."
Lisa!
-Any more nominations?
-We nominate Bart Simpson!
Speech!
I had a speech, but my dog ate it.
Children!
Bart, I need someone to deliver a note to the principal.
-Would you do it?
-But where's the principal's office?
What did I say about encouraging him?
When Bart wins approval for being a fool--
Yay, Bart!
Bart!
Bart!
Bart!
"Nobody, of the hundreds of people that visited the fair knew that a gray spider had played the most important part of all.
No one was with her when she died."
Come on, everybody has a talent.
-I wanna see yours.
-I don't have one.
There has to be something you do better than anyone.
-Well, I can do this.
-Yes!
Great!
How about you, Ralph?
Wonderful!
Chuck?
Disgusting.
I love it!
Lisa, you're holding out.
I see a saxophone!
-I can't.
-Come on.
I bet you're good.
-I can't.
-Sure you can.
-Please don't make me do it.
-You owe me one.
While I'm technically married it hasn't been much of a marriage since Mr. Krabappel moved out.
This profession can strain a marriage.
I've been looking for a substitute to teach me a lesson I sorely need.
Mrs. Krabappel, you're trying to seduce me.
Well?
I'm sorry.
You're very nice, but it's the children I love.
Mr. Bergstrom is the first thing I think of when I wake up.
I feel that way about Homer.
You don't understand.
When he smiles, you see these teeth.
But when he laughs, you see these.
The eyeteeth.
I don't know if he had braces, but they're perfect.
I notice little things about Homer.
Mom, this man makes you feel like there's nobody better.
-So does Homer.
-Mom, are we gonna talk or what?
You have to accept that I feel that way about your father.
Fine.
Yesterday, he read us Charlotte's Web and cried at the end.
A book made him cry!
Nobody gets back in after lunch without one igneous rock that's volcanic, and one sedimentary.
-Lisa, can I see you?
-Yes!
Yes?
Your homework is always so neat.
Does your father help you?
-Homework's not his specialty.
-It's okay.
My dad could--
-Not mine.
-Let me finish.
Unless the next word was "burp, " don't bother.

-Yeah.
-Now, go get them!
He says, there are no easy answers!
I say, he's not looking hard enough!
You never lose appealing to the lowest common denominator.
-You'll miss Bart.
-When?
When your life takes you places.
Places where my intelligence will be an asset?
Yes, there is such a place.
Believe me.
I believe everything you say, with your words and Semitic good looks.

The Springfield Museum of Natural History will be closing down in two weeks.
Go see it while you can.
Lisa needs to go to the museum, and I think you should take her.
The museum?
Tomorrow?
Oh, Marge, I'd love to, but I was planning on...
Sleeping?
Eating a big sandwich?
TV?
Spending time with the boy!

-I'm concerned about you and Lisa.
-Me too.
They're drifting apart.
-Shut up, boy.

You don't understand.

You're trapped.
You're not smart enough to get out of this.

Good luck, lady!
You'll need it!
-Mr.
Bergstrom!
-Hi, Lisa.
-Hey!
You don't have to pay!
-This must be your father.
His teeth were jagged, but he could swallow you whole.
Wow!
Actually, they do know a great deal about mummification.
First, they pulled the brain out and stuffed the skull with onions.
Gross!
Creepy.
But I'd rather have him after me than the Wolf Man.
Oh, Lord.
I've noticed that Lisa seems to feel she has no strong male role model.
-She said that?
-No, but, you know, she--
But you can tell, right?
She sees everybody else's dad with a good education and says, "What did I do to deserve this?"

Come on, everybody has a talent.
-I wanna see yours.
-I don't have one.
There has to be something you do better than anyone.
-Well, I can do this.
-Yes!
Great!
How about you, Ralph?
Wonderful!
Chuck?
Disgusting.
I love it!
Lisa, you're holding out.
I see a saxophone!
-I can't.
-Come on.
I bet you're good.
-I can't.
-Sure you can.
-Please don't make me do it.
-You owe me one.
While I'm technically married it hasn't been much of a marriage since Mr. Krabappel moved out.
This profession can strain a marriage.
I've been looking for a substitute to teach me a lesson I sorely need.
Mrs. Krabappel, you're trying to seduce me.
Well?
I'm sorry.
You're very nice, but it's the children I love.
Mr. Bergstrom is the first thing I think of when I wake up.
I feel that way about Homer.
You don't understand.
When he smiles, you see these teeth.
But when he laughs, you see these.
The eyeteeth.
I don't know if he had braces, but they're perfect.
I notice little things about Homer.
Mom, this man makes you feel like there's nobody better.
-So does Homer.
-Mom, are we gonna talk or what?
You have to accept that I feel that way about your father.
Fine.
Yesterday, he read us Charlotte's Web and cried at the end.
A book made him cry!
Nobody gets back in after lunch without one igneous rock that's volcanic, and one sedimentary.
-Lisa, can I see you?
-Yes!
Yes?
Your homework is always so neat.
Does your father help you?
-Homework's not his specialty.
-It's okay.
My dad could--
-Not mine.
-Let me finish.
Unless the next word was "burp, " don't bother.
In a sample taken in our classroom an inspector found 1.74 parts per million of asbestos!
That's not enough!
We demand more asbestos!
More asbestos!
More asbestos!
More asbestos!
-You made the front page.
-It's just a popularity contest.
"Just a popularity contest"?
What's more important than popularity?
-Bart, can you really win?
-Sure, why not?
I knew you had personality!
They said it was hyperactivity, but I knew better!
President Simpson.
Has a nice ring to it, doesn't it, boy?
-Yeah.
-Now, go get them!
He says, there are no easy answers!
I say, he's not looking hard enough!
You never lose appealing to the lowest common denominator.
-You'll miss Bart.
-When?
When your life takes you places.
Places where my intelligence will be an asset?
Yes, there is such a place.
Believe me.
I believe everything you say, with your words and Semitic good looks.
"Dear Miss Hoover:
You have Lyme disease.
We miss you.
Kevin's biting me.
Here's a drawing of a spirochete.
Love, Ralph."
Oh, that's great, Ralph!
The Springfield Museum of Natural History will be closing down in two weeks.
Go see it while you can.
Lisa needs to go to the museum, and I think you should take her.
The museum?
Tomorrow?
Oh, Marge, I'd love to, but I was planning on...
Sleeping?
Eating a big sandwich?
TV?
Spending time with the boy!
...spending time with the boy.
-I'm concerned about you and Lisa.
-Me too.
They're drifting apart.
-Shut up, boy.
-Homer, please.
You don't understand.
I can't--
You're trapped.
You're not smart enough to get out of this.
All right!
I'll take her!
Lousy brain.
-What's a "suggested donation"?
-Pay what you wish.
-And what if I wish to pay zero?
-It's up to you.
-So it's up to me, is it?
-Yes.
And you think that people are gonna pay you $4.50 when they don't have to, out of the goodness of their....
Anything you say!
Good luck, lady!
You'll need it!
-Mr.
Bergstrom!
-Hi, Lisa.
-Hey!
You don't have to pay!
-This must be your father.
His teeth were jagged, but he could swallow you whole.
Wow!
Actually, they do know a great deal about mummification.
First, they pulled the brain out and stuffed the skull with onions.
Gross!
Creepy.
But I'd rather have him after me than the Wolf Man.
Oh, Lord.
I've noticed that Lisa seems to feel she has no strong male role model.
-She said that?
-No, but, you know, she--
But you can tell, right?
She sees everybody else's dad with a good education and says, "What did I do to deserve this?"
You must be a bigger man.
There's a wonderful girl's future at stake.
-lf she's so great, give her an A.
-I am.
-Great.
Tell her she earned it.
-She did earn it.
You are smooth.
I'll give you that.
He ruined my chance to get to know Mr. Bergstrom outside school.
I'll tell you what, why don't we invite him to dinner?
Oh, Mom, that's wonderful!
-Can I help cook?
-Yes.
-Can I wear jewelry?
-Sure.
Dye my shoes?
Paint my nails?
Can we have wine?
Can I have wine?
Does Bart have to be there?
We request the pleasure of your company-
- No.
If you're not doing anything this Friday-
- No.
Mr. Bergstrom, do you like pork chops?
Oh, no, of course not.
Good morning, Lisa.
I'm back.
My Lyme disease turned out to be...
-...psychosomatic.
-Does that mean you're crazy?
-It means she was faking.
-It was a little of both.
Sometimes when a disease is on the news, it's natural to think you have it.
-Where's Mr. Bergstrom?
-Don't know.
But I'd like to talk to him.
He didn't use my lesson plan.
-What did he teach you?
-That life is worth living.
The polls are open till the end of recess.
In case any of you have thought about this we'll hear final statements.
Martin?
I don't think there's anything left to say.
-Bart?
-Victory party under the slide!
Mr. Bergstrom!
Mr. Bergstrom!
He moved out this morning.
He took his Copernicus costume.
Where is he?
He's taking the train to Capital City.
The train.
How like him.
Traditional, yet environmentally sound.
Yes.
And it's been the backbone of our country since Stanford drove in that golden spike.
I see he touched you too.
-Thanks for your vote.
-Voting's for geeks!
You got that right.
-Thanks for your vote.
-We forgot.
Oh, well, as long as a couple of people did.
Right, Milhouse?
Lewis?
-Somebody must have voted.
-What about you?
Didn't you vote?
I demand a re-count.
Two for Martin.
Want another re-count?
-No.
-I want to make sure.
One for Martin, two for Martin.
This way, Mr. President!
Now boarding the Afternoon Delight....
Mr. Bergstrom!
Hey, Lisa.
-Hey, Lisa, indeed!
-What?
What is it?
Were you just gonna leave, just like that?
I'm sorry, Lisa.
It's the life of the substitute teacher.
He's a fraud.
Today he wears gym shorts, tomorrow he speaks French or runs a band saw or God knows what.
You're the best teacher I'll ever have.
-That's not true.
Others will come.
-Oh, please!
You're right, I'm the best.
But they need me over in Capital City.
But I need you too.
When you're middle-class anybody who cares will leave to help someone needier.
I understand.
Mr. Bergstrom, I'm gonna miss you.
I'll tell you what.
Whenever you feel alone like there's no one you can rely on this is all you need to know.
Thank you, Mr. Bergstrom.
-All aboard!
-So, I guess this is it.
If you don't mind, I'll run alongside the train as it speeds you from my life.
Goodbye, Lisa, honey!
It'll be okay.
Just read the note!
Bart didn't get one vote?
This is the worst thing that could happen!
All right, spilled milk.
What are you so mopey about?
-Nothing.
-Lisa, tell your father.
-Mr.
Bergstrom left.
-Oh?
-He's gone.
Forever.
-And?
I didn't think you'd understand.
Just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't understand.
I'm glad I'm not crying.
I'd hate for you to think that what I'm gonna say is based on emotion.
But you, sir, are a baboon!
-Me?
-Yes, you!
Baboon!
Baboon!
Baboon!
-You don't realize what you're saying.
-Baboon!
Someone was bound to say it, but I never expected her.
Did you hear that?
She called me a baboon!
The stupidest and ugliest ape of all!
You're not allowed to be hurt now.
A little girl needs you.
Her confidence in you is shaken and no little girl can be happy without faith in her daddy.
"Go away."
Lisa, don't hold anything back.
You can tell me.
-You're sad you called me a baboon?
-No!
Nuts.
This isn't going well at all.
-lf you want me to forgive--
-No, I just wish I knew what to say.
But maybe this music will help.
Now, you lost someone special and it hurt.
I never lost anyone special to me.
Everyone special to me is under this roof.
It's true.
Now, you'll have lots of special people in your life.
There's probably a place they hang out and the food is good, and guys like me are serving drinks.
Maybe I can't explain all this, but I can fix your dollhouse.
At least I'm good at monkey work.
You know, monkey?
You know what I mean?
I can hold these nails in place with my tail.
-You're so silly.
-Give me a banana.
-I don't have any.
-You're holding out on me.
-I'm sorry I called you a baboon.
-Think nothing of it.
President Prince, President Princess, President Priss....
Hey, what's the matter, son?
Oh, Dad.
If just me, Milhouse and Lewis had voted.
Would you have gotten any money for being class president?
-No.
-Would you have more work?
Yeah.
Is Martin gonna get to do anything neat like play in the World Series?
-No.
-So, let the baby have his bottle.
That's my motto.
Hey, thanks, monkey-man.
Holy moly, talk about parenting.
Sleep well, Maggie.
Three for three.
-Did you straighten everything--?
-Don't say anything, Marge.
Let's just go to bed.
I'm on the biggest roll of my life.
Lisa's Substitute
Hear about Miss Hoover?
She drank some drain cleaner.
I heard she fell down a well.
Come on, now.
She's been dumped again.
I won't be staying long.
I just learned I have Lyme disease.
Principal Skinner will stay until a sub comes.
- What's Lyme disease?
- I know.
Lyme disease is spread by ticks.
When a tick begins to suck your blood spirochetes infest your blood and spinal fluid and then the brain.
The brain.
Oh, dear God!
Come on, Elizabeth.
Well, now, children, here we are.
Open your primers to page 32.
Ah, subtraction!
Bart Simpson, I know it's you!
And here comes Snowball II.
We kept this one.
The mother ate the gray one.
Mrs. Krabappel, he's traumatizing us.
I agree.
Bart, shut that off and sit down.
Look, this is cool.
When I hit reverse, I can make them go back in.
No, you're not seeing things.
This, my little friends, is a schwa.
- Are you the substitute?
- I am.
- Are you insane?
- It's how I get their attention.
All right.
Play friendly with your new teacher, children.
Howdy.
I'm a Texas cowboy from 1830.
- Ask me anything you like.
- Can we play kickball?
Kickball?
There ain't no kickball in 1830.
Any other questions?
Shoot!
It's awfully quiet.
Well, how about this?
I want to see both eyes up here.
There are three things wrong with my costume.
Name them and you get my hat.
- I know the answer.
- What's your name?
- Lisa Simpson.
- Well, go ahead.
Your belt says "State of Texas," but it wasn't a state until 1845.
Very good.
- The revolver wasn't around till 1835.
- Excellent.
You seem to be Jewish.
- You sure?
- Italian?
- Jewish.
- Cowboys aren't Jewish.
Good!
I also have a digital watch, but I'll accept that.
For the record, there were some Jewish cowboys.
Big guys who spent money freely.
I'm Mr. Bergstrom.
You can make fun of my name.
Two suggestions are Mr. Nerd-strom and Mr. Booger-strom.
Today we will begin selecting a class president.
I can't vote, but I suggest Martin.
Martin?
As president, I would demand a science fiction library featuring an ABC of the overlords of the genre:
- Asimov, Bester, Clarke...
- What about Bradbury?
I'm aware of his work.
Thank you, and keep watching the skies.
Excellent!
Excellent, Martin!
If you're through with your pemmican, why don't we sing a song?
This one's not very accurate, but we'll fix it.
Okay?
Actually, the range was far from home.
It was a desolate place of danger and disease.
Unlike the efficient Indians cowboys used only the tongue of the antelope.
What's this?
Did you do it?
No!
I would never do anything like that.
It was one of those immature...
- Can I have it?
- Yes, but I didn't do it.
- Are you sure you didn't?
It's good.
- I wish I had.
Class, "The Singing Dork."
Lisa!
- Any more nominations?
- We nominate Bart Simpson!
Speech!
I had a speech, but my dog ate it.
Children!
Bart, I need someone to deliver a note to the principal.
- Would you do it?
- But where's the principal's office?
What did I say about encouraging him?
When Bart wins approval for being a fool...
Yay, Bart!
Bart!
Bart!
Bart!

If you're through with your pemmican, why don't we sing a song?
This one's not very accurate, but we'll fix it.
Okay?
Actually, the range was far from home.
It was a desolate place of danger and disease.
Unlike the efficient Indians cowboys used only the tongue of the antelope.
What's this?
Did you do it?
No!
I would never do anything like that.
It was one of those immature--
-Can I have it?
-Yes, but I didn't do it.
-Are you sure you didn't?
It's good.
-I wish I had.
Class, "The Singing Dork."
Lisa!
-Any more nominations?
-We nominate Bart Simpson!
Speech!
I had a speech, but my dog ate it.
Children!
Bart, I need someone to deliver a note to the principal.
-Would you do it?
-But where's the principal's office?
What did I say about encouraging him?
When Bart wins approval for being a fool--
Yay, Bart!
Bart!
Bart!
Bart!
"Nobody, of the hundreds of people that visited the fair knew that a gray spider had played the most important part of all.
No one was with her when she died."
Come on, everybody has a talent.
-I wanna see yours.
-I don't have one.
There has to be something you do better than anyone.
-Well, I can do this.
-Yes!
Great!
How about you, Ralph?
Wonderful!
Chuck?
Disgusting.
I love it!
Lisa, you're holding out.
I see a saxophone!
-I can't.
-Come on.
I bet you're good.
-I can't.
-Sure you can.
-Please don't make me do it.
-You owe me one.
While I'm technically married it hasn't been much of a marriage since Mr. Krabappel moved out.
This profession can strain a marriage.
I've been looking for a substitute to teach me a lesson I sorely need.
Mrs. Krabappel, you're trying to seduce me.
Well?
I'm sorry.
You're very nice, but it's the children I love.
Mr. Bergstrom is the first thing I think of when I wake up.
I feel that way about Homer.
You don't understand.
When he smiles, you see these teeth.
But when he laughs, you see these.
The eyeteeth.
I don't know if he had braces, but they're perfect.
I notice little things about Homer.
Mom, this man makes you feel like there's nobody better.
-So does Homer.
-Mom, are we gonna talk or what?
You have to accept that I feel that way about your father.
Fine.
Yesterday, he read us Charlotte's Web and cried at the end.
A book made him cry!
Nobody gets back in after lunch without one igneous rock that's volcanic, and one sedimentary.
-Lisa, can I see you?
-Yes!
Yes?
Your homework is always so neat.
Does your father help you?
-Homework's not his specialty.
-It's okay.
My dad could--
-Not mine.
-Let me finish.
Unless the next word was "burp, " don't bother.
In a sample taken in our classroom an inspector found 1.74 parts per million of asbestos!
That's not enough!
We demand more asbestos!
More asbestos!
More asbestos!
More asbestos!
-You made the front page.
-It's just a popularity contest.
"Just a popularity contest"?
What's more important than popularity?
-Bart, can you really win?
-Sure, why not?
I knew you had personality!
They said it was hyperactivity, but I knew better!
President Simpson.
Has a nice ring to it, doesn't it, boy?
-Yeah.
-Now, go get them!
He says, there are no easy answers!
I say, he's not looking hard enough!
You never lose appealing to the lowest common denominator.
-You'll miss Bart.
-When?
When your life takes you places.
Places where my intelligence will be an asset?
Yes, there is such a place.
Believe me.
I believe everything you say, with your words and Semitic good looks.
"Dear Miss Hoover:
You have Lyme disease.
We miss you.
Kevin's biting me.
Here's a drawing of a spirochete.
Love, Ralph."
Oh, that's great, Ralph!
The Springfield Museum of Natural History will be closing down in two weeks.
Go see it while you can.
Lisa needs to go to the museum, and I think you should take her.
The museum?
Tomorrow?
Oh, Marge, I'd love to, but I was planning on...
Sleeping?
Eating a big sandwich?
TV?
Spending time with the boy!
...spending time with the boy.
-I'm concerned about you and Lisa.
-Me too.
They're drifting apart.
-Shut up, boy.
-Homer, please.
You don't understand.
I can't--
You're trapped.
You're not smart enough to get out of this.
All right!
I'll take her!
Lousy brain.
-What's a "suggested donation"?
-Pay what you wish.
-And what if I wish to pay zero?
-It's up to you.
-So it's up to me, is it?
-Yes.
And you think that people are gonna pay you $4.50 when they don't have to, out of the goodness of their....
Anything you say!
Good luck, lady!
You'll need it!
-Mr.
Bergstrom!
-Hi, Lisa.
-Hey!
You don't have to pay!
-This must be your father.
His teeth were jagged, but he could swallow you whole.
Wow!
Actually, they do know a great deal about mummification.
First, they pulled the brain out and stuffed the skull with onions.
Gross!
Creepy.
But I'd rather have him after me than the Wolf Man.
Oh, Lord.
I've noticed that Lisa seems to feel she has no strong male role model.
-She said that?
-No, but, you know, she--
But you can tell, right?
She sees everybody else's dad with a good education and says, "What did I do to deserve this?"
You must be a bigger man.
There's a wonderful girl's future at stake.
-lf she's so great, give her an A.
-I am.
-Great.
Tell her she earned it.
-She did earn it.
You are smooth.
I'll give you that.
He ruined my chance to get to know Mr. Bergstrom outside school.
I'll tell you what, why don't we invite him to dinner?
Oh, Mom, that's wonderful!
-Can I help cook?
-Yes.
-Can I wear jewelry?
-Sure.
Dye my shoes?
Paint my nails?
Can we have wine?
Can I have wine?
Does Bart have to be there?
We request the pleasure of your company-
- No.
If you're not doing anything this Friday-
- No.
Mr. Bergstrom, do you like pork chops?
Oh, no, of course not.
Good morning, Lisa.
I'm back.
My Lyme disease turned out to be...
-...psychosomatic.
-Does that mean you're crazy?
-It means she was faking.
-It was a little of both.
Sometimes when a disease is on the news, it's natural to think you have it.
-Where's Mr. Bergstrom?
-Don't know.
But I'd like to talk to him.
He didn't use my lesson plan.
-What did he teach you?
-That life is worth living.
The polls are open till the end of recess.
In case any of you have thought about this we'll hear final statements.
Martin?
I don't think there's anything left to say.
-Bart?
-Victory party under the slide!
Mr. Bergstrom!
Mr. Bergstrom!
He moved out this morning.
He took his Copernicus costume.
Where is he?
He's taking the train to Capital City.
The train.
How like him.
Traditional, yet environmentally sound.
Yes.
And it's been the backbone of our country since Stanford drove in that golden spike.
I see he touched you too.
-Thanks for your vote.
-Voting's for geeks!
You got that right.
-Thanks for your vote.
-We forgot.
Oh, well, as long as a couple of people did.
Right, Milhouse?
Lewis?
-Somebody must have voted.
-What about you?
Didn't you vote?
I demand a re-count.
Two for Martin.
Want another re-count?
-No.
-I want to make sure.
One for Martin, two for Martin.
This way, Mr. President!
Now boarding the Afternoon Delight....
Mr. Bergstrom!
Hey, Lisa.
-Hey, Lisa, indeed!
-What?
What is it?
Were you just gonna leave, just like that?
I'm sorry, Lisa.
It's the life of the substitute teacher.
He's a fraud.
Today he wears gym shorts, tomorrow he speaks French or runs a band saw or God knows what.
You're the best teacher I'll ever have.
-That's not true.
Others will come.
-Oh, please!
You're right, I'm the best.
But they need me over in Capital City.
But I need you too.
When you're middle-class anybody who cares will leave to help someone needier.
I understand.
Mr. Bergstrom, I'm gonna miss you.
I'll tell you what.
Whenever you feel alone like there's no one you can rely on this is all you need to know.
Thank you, Mr. Bergstrom.
-All aboard!
-So, I guess this is it.
If you don't mind, I'll run alongside the train as it speeds you from my life.
Goodbye, Lisa, honey!
It'll be okay.
Just read the note!
Bart didn't get one vote?
This is the worst thing that could happen!
All right, spilled milk.
What are you so mopey about?
-Nothing.
-Lisa, tell your father.
-Mr.
Bergstrom left.
-Oh?
-He's gone.
Forever.
-And?
I didn't think you'd understand.
Just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't understand.
I'm glad I'm not crying.
I'd hate for you to think that what I'm gonna say is based on emotion.
But you, sir, are a baboon!
-Me?
-Yes, you!
Baboon!
Baboon!
Baboon!
-You don't realize what you're saying.
-Baboon!
Someone was bound to say it, but I never expected her.
Did you hear that?
She called me a baboon!
The stupidest and ugliest ape of all!
You're not allowed to be hurt now.
A little girl needs you.
Her confidence in you is shaken and no little girl can be happy without faith in her daddy.
"Go away."
Lisa, don't hold anything back.
You can tell me.
-You're sad you called me a baboon?
-No!
Nuts.
This isn't going well at all.
-lf you want me to forgive--
-No, I just wish I knew what to say.
But maybe this music will help.
Now, you lost someone special and it hurt.
I never lost anyone special to me.
Everyone special to me is under this roof.
It's true.
Now, you'll have lots of special people in your life.
There's probably a place they hang out and the food is good, and guys like me are serving drinks.
Maybe I can't explain all this, but I can fix your dollhouse.
At least I'm good at monkey work.
You know, monkey?
You know what I mean?
I can hold these nails in place with my tail.
-You're so silly.
-Give me a banana.
-I don't have any.
-You're holding out on me.
-I'm sorry I called you a baboon.
-Think nothing of it.
President Prince, President Princess, President Priss....
Hey, what's the matter, son?
Oh, Dad.
If just me, Milhouse and Lewis had voted.
Would you have gotten any money for being class president?
-No.
-Would you have more work?
Yeah.
Is Martin gonna get to do anything neat like play in the World Series?
-No.
-So, let the baby have his bottle.
That's my motto.
Hey, thanks, monkey-man.
Holy moly, talk about parenting.
Sleep well, Maggie.
Three for three.
-Did you straighten everything--?
-Don't say anything, Marge.
Let's just go to bed.
I'm on the biggest roll of my life.
Hear about Miss Hoover?
She drank some drain cleaner.
I heard she fell down a well.
Come on, now.
She's been dumped again.
I won't be staying long.
I just learned I have Lyme disease.
Principal Skinner will stay until a sub comes.
-What's Lyme disease?
-I know.
Lyme disease is spread by ticks.
When a tick begins to suck your blood spirochetes infest your blood and spinal fluid and then the brain.
The brain.
Oh, dear God!
Come on, Elizabeth.
Well, now, children, here we are.
Open your primers to page 32.
Ah, subtraction!
Bart Simpson, I know it's you!
And here comes Snowball II.
We kept this one.
The mother ate the gray one.
Mrs. Krabappel, he's traumatizing us.
I agree.
Bart, shut that off and sit down.
Look, this is cool.
When I hit reverse, I can make them go back in.
No, you're not seeing things.
This, my little friends, is a schwa.
-Are you the substitute?
-I am.
-Are you insane?
-It's how I get their attention.
All right.
Play friendly with your new teacher, children.
Howdy.
I'm a Texas cowboy from 1830.
-Ask me anything you like.
-Can we play kickball?
Kickball?
There ain't no kickball in 1830.
Any other questions?
Shoot!
It's awfully quiet.
Well, how about this?
I want to see both eyes up here.
There are three things wrong with my costume.
Name them and you get my hat.
-I know the answer.
-What's your name?
-Lisa Simpson.
-Well, go ahead.
Your belt says "State of Texas, " but it wasn't a state until 1845.
Very good.
-The revolver wasn't around till 1835.
-Excellent.
You seem to be Jewish.
-You sure?
-Italian?
-Jewish.
-Cowboys aren't Jewish.
Good!
I also have a digital watch, but I'll accept that.
For the record, there were some Jewish cowboys.
Big guys who spent money freely.
I'm Mr. Bergstrom.
You can make fun of my name.
Two suggestions are Mr. Nerd-strom and Mr. Booger-strom.
Today we will begin selecting a class president.
I can't vote, but I suggest Martin.
Martin?
As president, I would demand a science fiction library featuring an ABC of the overlords of the genre:
-Asimov, Bester, Clarke--
-What about Bradbury?
I'm aware of his work.
Thank you, and keep watching the skies.
Excellent!
Excellent, Martin!

-What's your name?
-Lisa Simpson.
-Well, go ahead.
Your belt says "State of Texas, " but it wasn't a state until 1845.
Very good.
-The revolver wasn't around till 1835.
-Excellent.
You seem to be Jewish.
-You sure?
-Italian?
-Jewish.
-Cowboys aren't Jewish.
Good!
I also have a digital watch, but I'll accept that.
For the record, there were some Jewish cowboys.
Big guys who spent money freely.
I'm Mr. Bergstrom.
You can make fun of my name.
Two suggestions are Mr. Nerd-strom and Mr. Booger-strom.
Today we will begin selecting a class president.
I can't vote, but I suggest Martin.
Martin?
As president, I would demand a science fiction library featuring an ABC of the overlords of the genre:
-Asimov, Bester, Clarke--
-What about Bradbury?
I'm aware of his work.
Thank you, and keep watching the skies.
Excellent!
Excellent, Martin!
If you're through with your pemmican, why don't we sing a song?
This one's not very accurate, but we'll fix it.
Okay?
Actually, the range was far from home.
It was a desolate place of danger and disease.
Unlike the efficient Indians cowboys used only the tongue of the antelope.
What's this?
Did you do it?
No!
I would never do anything like that.
It was one of those immature--
-Can I have it?
-Yes, but I didn't do it.
-Are you sure you didn't?
It's good.
-I wish I had.
Class, "The Singing Dork."
Lisa!
-Any more nominations?
-We nominate Bart Simpson!
Speech!
I had a speech, but my dog ate it.
Children!
Bart, I need someone to deliver a note to the principal.
-Would you do it?
-But where's the principal's office?
What did I say about encouraging him?
When Bart wins approval for being a fool--
Yay, Bart!
Bart!
Bart!
Bart!
"Nobody, of the hundreds of people that visited the fair..."
...knew that a gray spider had played the most important part of all.
"No one was with her when she died."
Come on, everybody has a talent.
-I wanna see yours.
-I don't have one.
There has to be something you do better than anyone.
-Well, I can do this.
-Yes!
Great!
How about you, Ralph?
Wonderful!
Chuck?
Disgusting.
I love it!
Lisa, you're holding out.
I see a saxophone!
-I can't.
-Come on.
I bet you're good.
-I can't.
-Sure you can.
-Please don't make me do it.
-You owe me one.
While I'm technically married it hasn't been much of a marriage since Mr. Krabappel moved out.
This profession can strain a marriage.
I've been looking for a substitute to teach me a lesson I sorely need.
Mrs. Krabappel, you're trying to seduce me.
Well?
I'm sorry.
You're very nice, but it's the children I love.
Mr. Bergstrom is the first thing I think of when I wake up.
I feel that way about Homer.
You don't understand.
When he smiles, you see these teeth.
But when he laughs, you see these.
The eyeteeth.
I don't know if he had braces, but they're perfect.
I notice little things about Homer.
Mom, this man makes you feel like there's nobody better.
-So does Homer.
-Mom, are we gonna talk or what?
You have to accept that I feel that way about your father.
Fine.
Yesterday, he read us Charlotte's Web and cried at the end.
A book made him cry!
Nobody gets back in after lunch without one igneous rock that's volcanic, and one sedimentary.
-Lisa, can I see you?
-Yes!
Yes?
Your homework is always so neat.
Does your father help you?
-Homework's not his specialty.
-It's okay.
My dad could--
-Not mine.
-Let me finish.
Unless the next word was "burp, " don't bother.
In a sample taken in our classroom an inspector found 1.74 parts per million of asbestos!
That's not enough!
We demand more asbestos!
More asbestos!
More asbestos!
More asbestos!
-You made the front page.
-It's just a popularity contest.
"Just a popularity contest"?
What's more important than popularity?
-Bart, can you really win?
-Sure, why not?
I knew you had personality!
They said it was hyperactivity, but I knew better!
President Simpson.
Has a nice ring to it, doesn't it, boy?
-Yeah.
-Now, go get them!
He says, there are no easy answers!
I say, he's not looking hard enough!
You never lose appealing to the lowest common denominator.
-You'll miss Bart.
-When?
When your life takes you places.
Places where my intelligence will be an asset?
Yes, there is such a place.
Believe me.
I believe everything you say, with your words and Semitic good looks.
"Dear Miss Hoover:
You have Lyme disease.
We miss you.
Kevin's biting me.
Here's a drawing of a spirochete.
Love, Ralph."
Oh, that's great, Ralph!
The Springfield Museum of Natural History will be closing down in two weeks.
Go see it while you can.
Lisa needs to go to the museum, and I think you should take her.
The museum?
Tomorrow?
Oh, Marge, I'd love to, but I was planning on...
Sleeping?
Eating a big sandwich?
TV?
Spending time with the boy!
...spending time with the boy.
-I'm concerned about you and Lisa.
-Me too.
They're drifting apart.
-Shut up, boy.
-Homer, please.
You don't understand.
I can't--
You're trapped.
You're not smart enough to get out of this.
All right!
I'll take her!
Lousy brain.
-What's a "suggested donation"?
-Pay what you wish.
-And what if I wish to pay zero?
-It's up to you.
-So it's up to me, is it?
-Yes.
And you think that people are gonna pay you $4.50 when they don't have to, out of the goodness of their....
Anything you say!
Good luck, lady!
You'll need it!
-Mr.
Bergstrom!
-Hi, Lisa.
-Hey!
You don't have to pay!
-This must be your father.
His teeth were jagged, but he could swallow you whole.
Wow!
Actually, they do know a great deal about mummification.
First, they pulled the brain out and stuffed the skull with onions.
Gross!
Creepy.
But I'd rather have him after me than the Wolf Man.
Oh, Lord.
I've noticed that Lisa seems to feel she has no strong male role model.
-She said that?
-No, but, you know, she--
But you can tell, right?
She sees everybody else's dad with a good education and says, "What did I do to deserve this?"
You must be a bigger man.
There's a wonderful girl's future at stake.
-lf she's so great, give her an A.
-I am.
-Great.
Tell her she earned it.
-She did earn it.
You are smooth.
I'll give you that.
He ruined my chance to get to know Mr. Bergstrom outside school.
I'll tell you what, why don't we invite him to dinner?
Oh, Mom, that's wonderful!
-Can I help cook?
-Yes.
-Can I wear jewelry?
-Sure.
Dye my shoes?
Paint my nails?
Can we have wine?
Can I have wine?
Does Bart have to be there?
We request the pleasure of your company-
- No.
If you're not doing anything this Friday-
- No.
Mr. Bergstrom, do you like pork chops?
Oh, no, of course not.
Good morning, Lisa.
I'm back.
My Lyme disease turned out to be...
-...psychosomatic.
-Does that mean you're crazy?
-It means she was faking.
-It was a little of both.
Sometimes when a disease is on the news, it's natural to think you have it.
-Where's Mr. Bergstrom?
-Don't know.
But I'd like to talk to him.
He didn't use my lesson plan.
-What did he teach you?
-That life is worth living.
The polls are open till the end of recess.
In case any of you have thought about this we'll hear final statements.
Martin?
I don't think there's anything left to say.
-Bart?
-Victory party under the slide!
Mr. Bergstrom!
Mr. Bergstrom!
He moved out this morning.
He took his Copernicus costume.
Where is he?
He's taking the train to Capital City.
The train.
How like him.
Traditional, yet environmentally sound.
Yes.
And it's been the backbone of our country since Stanford drove in that golden spike.
I see he touched you too.
-Thanks for your vote.
-Voting's for geeks!
You got that right.
-Thanks for your vote.
-We forgot.
Oh, well, as long as a couple of people did.
Right, Milhouse?
Lewis?
-Somebody must have voted.
-What about you?
Didn't you vote?
I demand a re-count.
Two for Martin.
Want another re-count?
-No.
-I want to make sure.
One for Martin, two for Martin.
This way, Mr. President!
Now boarding the Afternoon Delight....
Mr. Bergstrom!
Hey, Lisa.
-Hey, Lisa, indeed!
-What?
What is it?
Were you just gonna leave, just like that?
I'm sorry, Lisa.
It's the life of the substitute teacher.
He's a fraud.
Today he wears gym shorts, tomorrow he speaks French or runs a band saw or God knows what.
You're the best teacher I'll ever have.
-That's not true.
Others will come.
-Oh, please!
You're right, I'm the best.
But they need me over in Capital City.
But I need you too.
When you're middle-class anybody who cares will leave to help someone needier.
I understand.
Mr. Bergstrom, I'm gonna miss you.
I'll tell you what.
Whenever you feel alone like there's no one you can rely on this is all you need to know.
Thank you, Mr. Bergstrom.
-All aboard!
-So, I guess this is it.
If you don't mind, I'll run alongside the train as it speeds you from my life.
Goodbye, Lisa, honey!
It'll be okay.
Just read the note!
Bart didn't get one vote?
This is the worst thing that could happen!
All right, spilled milk.
What are you so mopey about?
-Nothing.
-Lisa, tell your father.
-Mr.
Bergstrom left.
-Oh?
-He's gone.
Forever.
-And?
I didn't think you'd understand.
Just because I don't care doesn't mean I don't understand.
I'm glad I'm not crying.
I'd hate for you to think that what I'm gonna say is based on emotion.
But you, sir, are a baboon!
-Me?
-Yes, you!
Baboon!
Baboon!
Baboon!
-You don't realize what you're saying.
-Baboon!
Someone was bound to say it, but I never expected her.
Did you hear that?
She called me a baboon!
The stupidest and ugliest ape of all!
You're not allowed to be hurt now.
A little girl needs you.
Her confidence in you is shaken and no little girl can be happy without faith in her daddy.
"Go away."
Lisa, don't hold anything back.
You can tell me.
-You're sad you called me a baboon?
-No!
Nuts.
This isn't going well at all.
-lf you want me to forgive--
-No, I just wish I knew what to say.
But maybe this music will help.
Now, you lost someone special and it hurt.
I never lost anyone special to me.
Everyone special to me is under this roof.
It's true.
Now, you'll have lots of special people in your life.
There's probably a place they hang out and the food is good, and guys like me are serving drinks.
Maybe I can't explain all this, but I can fix your dollhouse.
At least I'm good at monkey work.
You know, monkey?
You know what I mean?
I can hold these nails in place with my tail.
-You're so silly.
-Give me a banana.
-I don't have any.
-You're holding out on me.
-I'm sorry I called you a baboon.
-Think nothing of it.
President Prince, President Princess, President Priss....
Hey, what's the matter, son?
Oh, Dad.
If just me, Milhouse and Lewis had voted.
Would you have gotten any money for being class president?
-No.
-Would you have more work?
Yeah.
Is Martin gonna get to do anything neat like play in the World Series?
-No.
-So, let the baby have his bottle.
That's my motto.
Hey, thanks, monkey-man.
Holy moly, talk about parenting.
Sleep well, Maggie.
Three for three.
-Did you straighten everything--?
-Don't say anything, Marge.
Let's just go to bed.
I'm on the biggest roll of my life.
Hear about Miss Hoover?
She drank some drain cleaner.
I heard she fell down a well.
Come on, now.
She's been dumped again.
I won't be staying long.
I just learned I have Lyme disease.
Principal Skinner will stay until a sub comes.
-What's Lyme disease?
-I know.
Lyme disease is spread by ticks.
When a tick begins to suck your blood spirochetes infest your blood and spinal fluid and then the brain.
The brain.
Oh, dear God!
Come on, Elizabeth.
Well, now, children, here we are.
Open your primers to page 32.
Ah, subtraction!
Bart Simpson, I know it's you!
And here comes Snowball II.
We kept this one.
The mother ate the gray one.
Mrs. Krabappel, he's traumatizing us.
I agree.
Bart, shut that off and sit down.
Look, this is cool.
When I hit reverse, I can make them go back in.
No, you're not seeing things.
This, my little friends, is a schwa.
-Are you the substitute?
-I am.
-Are you insane?
-It's how I get their attention.
All right.
Play friendly with your new teacher, children.
Howdy.
I'm a Texas cowboy from 1830.
-Ask me anything you like.
-Can we play kickball?
Kickball?
There ain't no kickball in 1830.
Any other questions?
Shoot!
It's awfully quiet.
Well, how about this?
I want to see both eyes up here.
There are three things wrong with my costume.
Name them and you get my hat.
-I know the answer.
-What's your name?
-Lisa Simpson.
-Well, go ahead.
Your belt says "State of Texas, " but it wasn't a state until 1845.
Very good.
-The revolver wasn't around till 1835.
-Excellent.
You seem to be Jewish.

We're gonna show you how to do a dado head cut move today.
A dado is just a carpenter's term for a groove cut into wood.
If you use the word "dado".
your wife will think you're intelligent.
- Right, Al?
- I'm not married, Tim.
If you use it in a conversation.
maybe you'll get lucky.
for cutting that dado, we're gonna be using something that looks like this.
Here you go, Tim.
Thank you.
This is the Binford Mach Three SuperPlunge Router.
A thing of beauty, isn't it?
Three horsepower motor.
variable electronic speed control and an adjustable depth-stop system.
When using a router.
you wanna use a real steady hand.
You could use the guide arm so it doesn't get away from you.
You don't always have to use the guide arm if you have a steady hand.
- If you want a straight line, Tim.
- I've been doing this for years, all right?
Just hold the table, all right?
Start our cut.
Set your depth gauge and get going.
Perfect, Al.
Just does a good job of scrolling.
While Al cleans up this deliberate mess of mine.
I'd like to welcome a new family member to Tool Time.
Alpena.
Michigan.
Cold in the winter...
Pretty cold in the summer too, isn't it?
Kidding around with you.
It's channel 97 there on your cable box.
I'd like to give the folks up there in Alpena -
Al, there you are - a Tool Time greeting.
What do you say, Al?
Come on, guys.
I'll tell ya...
That's about all for Tool Time today.
I'm Tim "the Tool Man" Taylor.
hoping that all your fasteners stay tight.
See you next time.
- Good show, Al.
- Yeah.
Right, Tim.
I'm installing a satellite dish this Saturday.
You mean the one we used on the show last week?
They almost gave it to me, demo cost.
Cost me nothing.
I'm happy for you, Tim.
I was hoping you could stop by Saturday.
maybe have lunch, help me put it up.
I was hoping to have the weekend alone.
Kind of a private man time.
- Oh, good, Al.
- Yeah.
What time are you coming tomorrow to help me put up my bookshelves?
- How about 9:00?
- Perfect.
I'll see you then.
- Bye, Tim.
- See you, Lis.
That private man time?
She's a co-worker, Tim.
I think of her as a man.
That's why you're still single, Al.
Once we get that satellite dish on the roof.
run that co-ax cable down the wall.
Mark.
run it through the house.
attach it to that TV set.
we are equipped to get 200 stations.
- 200 stations?
- Yeah.
Now it will take you 45 minutes to find out there's nothing on you wanna watch.
Can you smell that?
That's diesel fumes.
That's a turbo diesel.
That's 16 speeds.
Tandem axle.
That's a delivery truck.
- You can smell all that?
- I sure can.
Come on, help me out.
Go out and see if that delivery truck's on the way.
I think our satellite dish is coming.
Let me know when it's in.
Great.
You're a lifesaver.
No.
Today is fine.
Come right over.
Thank you so much.
I really appreciate this.
OK.
Bye-bye.
- Who was that?
- Rondall.
The teacher from that job search seminar I've been taking.
- Why is he coming over here?
- Last Monday after class.
we were having coffee, and he said...
Time out, flag that play.
- You had coffee with Rondall?
- Yeah.
You didn't tell me about this coffee.
I'm sorry.
It was cream, mo sugars.
Was it coffee?
Or coffee and dancing?
Tim, don't be silly.
A few of us went out for coffee after class...
Safety in numbers thing.
Rondall said that if anybody needed any extra help, we should give him a call.
So you sprinted right over to the phone and called him?
Yes.
He's gonna help me get my resume in order for my job interview on Monday.
Giving up his whole day Saturday.
That guy must have a pretty understanding wife.
He's not married.
How'd you find that out?
During coffee?
No, while we were dancing.
- That's good.
- Tim, what is the matter with you?
- Don't you trust me?
- No, it's not trust.
I'm just...
I'm just not sure a man would give up a Saturday for a woman unless he wanted something in return.
Tim, he's just a good guy.
He's helping me out.
Don't I recall you telling me that he was this big, strapping, cute, hunk kinda guy?
- You know I never said that.
- Is he kinda cute?
I don't know.
Some people would say so.
Cuter than me?
Some people would say so.
- This is cool.
- Excellent.
That's true parabolic shape for super-efficient reflectivity, men.
- Mr Taylor, will you sign this, please?
- Sure, man.
Oh, my God.
This thing is huge.
How are you ever gonna get that up on the roof?
That's why I have that pulley ratchet system setup up there.
You're gonna put this up yourself?
Yeah, right.
Tim, what do you know about installing a satellite dish?
It's simple.
Mount it, point it straight up.
Any man can do that.
Yeah, but... it has to stay up longer than ten seconds.
That must be Rondall.
Boys. look.
It's the dancing coffee drinker.
This interview is really important to me and this guy's gonna help me.
Please behave.
I promise I will be a perfect gentleman the entire time he's here.
- How does this thing work.
Dad?
- Use your imagination, if you will.
You look up there, there are satellites orbiting the planet.
sucking up information from every corner of the globe and spitting it back down here in this parabolic dish.
This is very dangerous, though, satellite dishes, cos they have a pulse of their own.
If you don't watch out.
they can suck you into them.
Tim?
Tim?
This is Rondall Kittleman.
Rondall, this is my husband Tim.
Hi, Tim.
These are my boys.
That's Randy, Mark and Brad.
- Hi, guys.
- I was...
I was just showing the kids how scientific these...
We just got this.
- Really?
It's a beauty.
- Help me.
Dad.
It's sucking me in.
No, it's not.
I don't know where they get these ideas.
Come on, you guys, get outta here.
Mommy. look.
I got a splinter.
Oh, honey.
Let's get the tweezers and we'll get that out.
Will you excuse me?
Just a minute.
Honey.
I hope you realize I'm gonna have to use the needle.
No.
- Jill's told me a lot about you.
Ron.
- Rondall.
It's Ron.., dall.
Great name.
- You know, you look familiar.
- Well, you've probably seen me on TV.
I got my own home improvement show.
Jill told you about it.
No, she didn't mention it.
Oh, no.
Right, right.
Wait a minute, of course.
That's why you look familiar.
You got that little tool show on the cable.
We don't look at it as little because we pick up a lot of cities.
- We just got Alpena.
- Yeah?
Really?
Both sets?
Sorry.
Just kidding you there, pal.
That's pretty funny.
Rondall.
Do that thing you do on the show.
That barking sound.
It's really not barking.
It's more like a simian grunt.
Yeah, barking, grunting, whatever.
It's a very funny show.
- You're very funny on it.
- It's not all fun and games.
It's a home improvement show.
Basically what we do...
Well, but you're very funny on it.
Not like the other guy on the show.
The guy who knows everything.
Al.
Al's my assistant.
He assists me.
- Everything's ready.
Do you want to start?
- Sure.
I'd like to help you guys, but I'm gonna finish up that satellite stuff.
- Can I take your coat?
- Thank you.
Your husband's putting up a satellite dish?
Yeah.
This afternoon.
- I hope you have some help.
- Don't need any help.
Bondo.
- No.
I'm gonna do it all by myself.
- Maybe you should call Al.
He really knows about all that stuff.
- Al is my assistant.
He assists me.
- Yeah.
I think you should listen to Jill.
When I had mine put in.
I had a couple of guys from Global View Satellites install it.
Did ya?
That must have cost you a pretty penny?
You know, it was worth it when you consider that the installation requires a precise calculation of the declination angle of the dish in relation to the equator.
Yeah.
The slightest deviation and the dish is useless.
Of course, you know that.
It goes without saying.
Tim, call Al.
Al is busy today.
The important thing right now is that you get that dish up on the roof.
No problemo.
Rondanello.
- Wilson?
Wilson, you back there?
- Right here, good neighbor.
When you watch my show Tool Time.
do you think I'm funny?
I've got to be honest with you, Tim.
I've never seen the show.
- You've never seen my show?
- No.
- But I don't have a television.
- Everybody's got a TV.
Not me.
I just use my imagination.
Watch the pictures inside my mind.
Cuts down on reruns then, doesn't it?
Not really, Tim.
There's always déjà vu.
Right.
Tim.
I got the feeling you got something more on your mind than television.
Not really.
Wilson.
It's just Jill is working on her rėsumė with this guy, a know-it-all type.
He's trying to impress her.
That worries you?
I'm not jealous.
I'm the least jealous guy on earth, really.
Curious thing about jealousy.
Usually it stems from insecurity.
There's no insecurity here.
I can tell you that.
However much I'm not jealous.
I'm mice as much not insecure.
You should be secure, Tim.
You've got what every man dreams of.
Yeah.
A satellite dish.
No, Tim.
Three strapping boys.
a nice home, a loving wife.
You're so right, you know.
Jill and I share so many great things.
memories, great food - we love eating.
you know - laughter.
Nobody makes her laugh like I do.
1 00:14:31,320 -- 00:14:32,590 What's so funny?
What are you laughing at?
It's nothing at all.
Really.
Come on.
We always laugh around here.
- Come on.
What's so funny?
- Well.
OK.
There's a woman in our class that was always asking questions...
- No, honey, that's not the funny part.
- Of course not.
So, anyway, one day Rondall asked if there are any questions.
and the woman stands up and forgets what she's gonna say.
I told you it's not funny.
I guess you had to be there.
I got to make some measurements for this cable.
Just pretend like I'm not here.
Listen.
About this interview.
I was gonna wear this blue suit with a plain white blouse.
- Is that just too blah?
- No.
I like white.
It's simple but it's classic.
It shows you're not a slave to trends.
What was that, Tim?
Nothing.
I was thinking about that joke.
"She didn't know what to say."
It just took me a while.
Anyway.
Rondall, this jacket has really big shoulder pads.
Should I take them out?
They say wide shoulders make your neck look geeky.
No.
Wide shoulders show that you bear responsibility.
Maybe we should just get back to the rėsumė.
OK.
I brought samples over.
which I left in the car.
I'll go get them.
Be right back.
Tim, what was this?
I was shoveling manure.
You're not buying this crock?
I love this stuff.
Shoulder pads show strength and motion.
- Color just brighten your life.
- I know.
It sounds really stupid.
But the guy is a professional.
What is the matter with you?
What's the matter with me is I'm seeing a guy in my house hitting on my wife.
- What?
- Come on.
Don't be so naive.
You see what's happening here?
No.
Guy's over here on Saturday.
drinking coffee, making you laugh.
Oh.
God.
You're right.
How could I have missed something so obvious?
He's obviously just a great big walking hormone.
You laugh.
You make jokes.
I can smell testosterone right here.
And just a wee bit of estrogen thrown in.
- Tim.
- Look at this.
- Look.
- Tim, get out of there.
- That is his personal property.
- Look at this.
Breath mints, cigarettes.
Now I've got it.
This is before.
This is after.
There may be a very good reason for him to have breath mints.
Rondall may just have bad breath.
Actually.
I don't.
I'm sorry.
Sometimes when people smoke.
they have bad breath...
Would you excuse me for a minute?
I want to talk to Tim.
I haven't worked in a really long time.
I'm really nervous about my interview on Monday.
This guy is trying to help me.
This guy would be helping himself to you if I wasn't here.
No chance of that.
You haven't left us alone for more than ten minutes.
- Is that what you want?
Ten minutes?
- I just wanna finish my rėsumė.
All right.
Excuse me.
I'll be up on the roof, completely out of sight.
You won't hear me all day.
I can't hear a thing.
I'll be up there all by myself.
Thank you.
I am so sorry for all the interruptions.
That's OK.
Maybe we can do this another time.
But my interview at the Duncan Phillips Agency is on Monday.
OK.
Well.
Let's finish your rėsumė.
- We're almost done.
- Thank you.
- What time is your appointment?
- It's 2:00.
Why don't you and I have lunch together?
Are you saying, lunch just you and me?
The two of us?
Of course not.
I'm a good friend of the VP in sales over there.
- You could join us before the interview.
- Great.
That would be a tremendous help.
When you put down your educational information, make sure...
I'm sorry.
I forgot my friend won't be back from Cleveland on Monday.
But you and I could still get together.
You mean that we're back to you and I alone together?
Jill, you know your husband's hanging from the roof, spying on us.
No, he's not spying on us.
He's just hanging upside down.
He does that all the time.
to check things.
- I think he has a problem with me.
- No.
He really likes you.
- Does he?
- Yeah.
I think he's a bit uncomfortable with me.
I think it's because he's sensing what I've been sensing.
- Which is what?
- You have been sending out signals.
Signals?
What signals?
- You asked me out for coffee after class.
- No!
That was just...
There were four of us.
You were way across the table.
Yeah, but every time I turn around from the blackboard I see you staring into my eyes.
No, that's just paying attention.
That's a good thing.
I don't know why you're fighting it.
Jill.
There's obviously something happening between us.
I feel it.
You feel it.
It's chemistry.
No.
I flunked chemistry.
Jill, you're playing hard to get.
I love that.
No.
I'm playing "no get." I am a "no get" woman.
I'm a happy, married. "no get" woman.
with a wonderful husband.
There's Mr Wonderful now.
- Honey, are you all right?
- Just testing the safety line on this.
I'm sorry, but I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
That's good.
You're pretending to throw me out because your husband can see us.
No.
I'm really throwing you out.
Speak a little louder so he can hear you.
Here's you coat.
There's the door.
That's a good touch with the jacket.
I like that.
Rondall, you want a signal?
Here is your signal.
I'm confused.
Does that mean we're not having lunch?
Get out.
- Jill.
Come on out here, please.
- Tim.
I don't believe it.
- I am so embarrassed.
I feel like fool.
- Could you untangle that rope?
You were right.
That slime came on to me.
He wanted me to have lunch with him.
Get him out here.
- No.
I took care of it.
I threw him out.
- Good for you.
- He said I was sending him signals.
- Jill, could you just untie this knot?
- I would never send signals.
- I know you wouldn't.
Let's talk about this another time.
My legs are numb.
I am so sorry.
I just never realized...
I'm a married woman.
I got three kids.
You're a beautiful, intelligent, sexy woman.
He'd be a fool not to hit on you.
Oh, Tim.
You're so sweet.
- Could you cut me down, please?
- No.
I like you like this.
All right, settle in.
200 channels of family entertainment.
Seen it.
Seen it.
Seen that.
Seen it.
Seen it.
Seen it.
Will you slow down?
Let me have that thing.
- What's that?
- Sumo wrestling from Japan.
Seen it.
Now, that's better.

Homer, you silly goose.
The weed-whacker's just for the edges.
You'll be out here all day.
I'm almost done.
You are a picture and a half.
If you're finished by tomorrow, come on over... and we'll put the heat to the meat.
Nummy-nummy-num!
I'll be there!
...Notty-notty-not.
"The Flanders are having a beef-a-thon!
Incredible Nedibles!
Maudacious vittles!"
I think it means he's having a barbecue.
Why doesn't he just say so?
!
He's trying to be friendly.
If you gave Ned Flanders a chance--
I don't care if he is the nicest guy in the world.
He's a jerk.
End of story.
We can't hold it against him... just because he has things better than we do.
Excuse me?
Better?
Thanks a lot, Marge.
You put me in my place.
Oh, Homer...
It's worth feeling three inches tall... to find out what kind of person you are...
Marge Simpson, president of the "We Love Flanders" fan club.
[ Both Growling ]
Fee, fi, fo, fum!
I smell the potatoes au gratin... of Marge Simpson.
Mm-mm-mm-mmm!
Hi, Ned.
Um...
Homer sends his apologies... but, um... there was some important work at the plant... that only he could take care of.
We now return to the Canadian Football League draft.
And so, the Rough Riders... who scored only four rouges all last season,Jack...
Stupid Flanders.
Go ahead, Marge.
Have a ball.
What if they came back... and I was dead from not eating?
They'd cry their eyes out.
"We should have never gone to the Flanders'.
"Why did we go to the Flanders' and leave Homer alone with no food?"
And I'd be laughing-- Laughing from my grave.
Heh, heh, heh.
[ Sizzling ]
[ Barks ]
What is it, boy?
What?
[ Sniffs ]
Mmm.
Barbecue.

Ahh.

Hey, I'm back.
Nice seeing you.
Hey!
Oh!
Hey, hey, Homer!
[ Mumbling ] Ahmmffluhff...
Inside.
Okay.
Thanks for coming.
You're it.
Electricity.
Nuh-uh!
No electricity.
Only in freeze tag.
Okay.
Now you're it!
Hey!
No tag-backs!
Yeah, you cheater.
You lie like a fly... with a booger in its eye.
The fly was funny.
The booger was the icing on the cake.
Friends, we love you all... but I also have a sinister motive... for asking you all here...
"sinister" being Latin for left-handed.
But enough joking.
That was a joke?
Friday, I'm saying toodle-loo... to the pharmaceutical game.
- What's he talking about?
- Leaving?
No, I kid you not.
Here's the noose I had to wear for ten years.
[ Oohs and Ahhs ]
What are you going to do?
Like one out of every nine Americans...
I'm left-handed, and let me tell you... it ain't all peaches and cream.
Your writing gets smeared.
Lord help you if you drive a standard transmission.
I'm opening up a one-stop store for southpaws.
Everything from left-handed apple peelers... to left-handed scissors.
Going to call it "The Leftorium."
[ Oohs and Ahhs ]
So, Homer, I'm dying to know... what do you think ofthe Leftorium?
It sounds like a pretty dumb idea to me.
I know it's a little risky... and it's going to be a lot of hard work... but it's going to be a lot of fun too.
Fun?
Where is this store, Flanders?
The merry old land of Oz?
Oh, no.
The Springfield Mall.
Here, you two, make a wish.
Nah!
- It's fun.
- No, it isn't.
You must have something you want to wish for.
Hmm, let's see...
Nah.
Hmm...
Hey!
I've got an ambition to do some wishing'.
Keep your pants on, Flanders!
I'm wishing as fast as I can!
Ooh!
Heh, heh, heh, heh.
Eh... too far.
Hmm...
Okay, ready.
Yes!
Oh, yes!
Read it and weep!
In your face!
I've got more chicken bone!
What did you wish for?
No!
Don't say.
Otherwise, it won't come true.
Ooh, that would be a shame.
Wouldn't it, Flanders?

Bart... how many hours a day do you watch TV?
Six.
Seven if there's something good on.
Don't you think... you should get a little fresh air?
Yeah, but what are you going to do?
TV gives so much and asks so little.
It's a boy's best friend.
That's the problem.
Even as we speak... millions of children are staring at the TV... instead of getting some much-needed exercise.
Those children's parents... should be ashamed of themselves.
Hello, I am Akira.
Huahh!
That didn't hurt very much... because I know the ancient art of karate.
Karate focuses the mind and gives one self-confidence.
People from all walks of life:
- doctors...
-Hi-yaah!
- homemakers...
- Hu-yaah!
- landscape architects...
- Huhh-yah!
- choreographers...
- Haww.
High karate at low, low prices.
I cannot tell a lie.
This is a great deal.
Hohh!
Hey, Mom, how about... if I learn karate?
Will that make you happy?
That sounds fine.
See, you knock TV, and then it helps you out.
I think you owe somebody a little apology.
Well, if it isn't The Leftorium.
Hey, Flanders, how's business?
Oh, a little pokey... but things are going to pick up.
[ Crash ]
Oh!
I am so sorry.
How much do I owe you?
Now that was an accident.
Really?
Well, thanks.
Could you validate my parking?
Absitively posolutely.
So, Flanders, have you sold anything?
Not yet, but one of the mall security guards... took a long look... at a left-handed ice cream scoop.
Greetings, I am Akira... your guide on the path to true karate.
And this is our map, The Art of War by Sun Tzu.
It will teach us our most important lesson.
We learn karate, so we need never use it.
Um...
I already know how not to hit a guy.
Can we break out the nunchukus?
Yes, the impetuousness of youth.
For now, let us read.
When do we break blocks of ice with our heads?
First you must fill your head with wisdom.
Yo, Sensei, can I go to the bathroom?
You can if you believe you can.
Pay money to read books.
The hell with this.
[ Video Game Grunting ]
Come on.
Touch of Death!
Touch of Death!
[ Ghostly Moaning ]
Hah, hah, hah!
[ Homer Laughing ]
I'm telling you.
Flanders' store was dee-serted.
What do you think of your bestest buddy now?
Dad, do you know what ''schadenfreude" is?
No, I do not know what ''schadenfreude" is.
Please tell me because I'm dying to know.
It's German for "shameful joy--"
taking pleasure in others' suffering.
I'm just glad to see him fall flat on his butt.
He's usually all happy and comfortable... and surrounded by loved ones, and it makes me feel--
What's the opposite of that "shameful joy" thing of yours?
Sour grapes.
Those Germans have... a word for everything.
What did you learn in karate school?
Yeah, this better be worth my ten bucks.
Uh...
I learned the Touch of Death.
Ooh, the Touch of Death.
Permit me to demonstrate.
Lisa, shut your eyes.
Soon you will be at peace.
Hey, quit it, Bart. Quit it.
Quit it!
Quit it!
Quit it!
Mom!
Don't use the Touch of Death on your sister.
[ Screaming ]
Uh-oh!
Got to get back to karate class.
Missed a spot.
Dopey kid.
Coming through.
Step aside, lady.
Mmm, baby.
How was class?
We learned how to rip a man's heart out... and show it to him before he dies.
That will learn them.
What did you swipe?
An "I Love Lefty" glass.
Left-handed pinking shears.
Pinking shears?
Let's go to the food court and steal... some baked potatoes.
Hey, Flanders, when are your busy hours?
I expect things to pick up soon.
I think word of mouth is starting to spread.
I hear you... validate parking tickets without purchase.
Oh, right as rain.
Or as we say around here, "left as rain."
Just stamp it.
Okay.
Hey, Homer, how's your neighbor's store doing?
Lousy.
He just sits there all day.
He'd have a great job if he didn't own the place.
[ Laughing ]
Crummy right-handed corkscrews.
What does he sell?
Uh... well, actually, Moe, uh...
I don't know.
Lise, change the channel.
You change it.
Ooowaaah...
Okay, okay.
[ Gunshots And Sirens ]
I grow weary of this new channel.
Change it back.
But, Bart...
Eeeyaahhh...
Apple... apple... apple...
Come on, candy bar.
Hey, you're that first apple I didn't want.
That sinks it.
I'm really going to let them have it this time.
Simpson, put that box on Mr. Burns' desk.
Chop-chop!
[ Grunting ]
Oh, look, Smithers.
Another member of our nuclear family... with some helpful suggestions.
And what's your name?
Homer Simpson, sir.
Simpson, eh?
Mm-hmm.
I'm Monty Burns.
"Keep that handsome owner out of sight.
He's distracting the female employees."
Smithers?
Got me, sir.
Oh, it's a real one.
"No more apples in the vending machine, please."
Well, that's almost a sentence.
Can I leave?
Of course, and don't worry.
There will be plenty of apples for you.
Nobody will take away your precious apples.
The note was asking you to--
No, tell my secretary I said you could have a free apple.
She'll make everything all right.
I promise.
[ Grunting ]
Damned infernal gizmo.
My kingdom for a left-handed can opener!
Uh, Mr. Burns...
Come on, Homer.
Tell him about the store.
I'm dying out here.
Sorry, Flanders.
Huh?
Are you sure... you're not interested?
$200 is only the asking price.
Sorry, Ned.
Hey, I'm flexible.
You don't have to pay all at once.
I'll be here all night if you change your mind.
Hey, Flanders, is everything okay?
Oh, yeah, sure.
See anything you like?
Oh, it's not good enough for you... but it's good enough for me?
I wouldn't be caught dead buying this...
Hello.
Got your eye on the gas grill, huh?
She's a butane beaut.
I'll give you 20.
Homer, I paid $300 for this just last year.
$20.
Take it or leave it.
Oh, Homer, be reasonable.
Sorry, no cash for Neddy.
Homer keep all money.
Bye-bye, Neddy.
All right, Homer.
$20?
$20.
I don't want it.
What?
!
It was... a passing fancy.
Although, if you threw in a few lawn chairs... maybe that tool bench, it might rekindle my interest.
Hey, Bartely-boobely.
Care for a steakarooni?
Sounds scrum-diddley-umptious, dear old duddely-doodely.
[ Homer] Duddely-doodely.
This is the Flanders' living room set.
What did you pay for this?
Only 7 5 beans.
$7 5?
Ned must be desperate.
I'm sure you did nothing to discourage this... you scavenger of human misery.
Hey!
Keep your hands off my china hutch.
[ Doorbell Ringing ]
I'm Chuck Ellis... from the Springfield Collection Agency... and I'm here to ask you why you don't think... you need to pay your bills?
Oh, I know I need to pay them, but there's just so many.
Do you feel good owing money?
We've been very patient with you, Mr. Flanders.
I know, but-
- Wait a minute.
I'm Homer Simpson.
Ned Flanders lives over there.
Oh.
Flanders is in debt?
Are you sure?
We don't make mistakes.
Damned right-handed ledgers.
I can't write in these things.
There's a store...
You're Homer Simpson?
See you Thursday.
D'oh!
Knock 'em dead, boy.
Kid's going to be a black belt in no time.
[ Gasping ]
[ Crying ]
Ohhh...
Check out the saxophone.
Pretty boss... but something's stuck on it.
Hey!
[ Plays Sour Notes ]
Hey, look at me.
I'm Elvis, man!
Give that back!
That to me!
If you want it, take it.
[ Boys Laughing ]
Okay.
We're sorry.
This time, we're really going to give it to you.
Hey, stop that!
[ Boys Laughing ]
[ Lisa Crying ]
Hey, Lise, something wrong?
Not anymore!
You punks are about to get... a taste of your own medicine.
This is my brother, and he knows karate.
Uh-oh.
Oh, we're real scared.
Please don't hurt us, Bart.
What are you going to do?
Throw your diapers at us?
[ Moaning ]
Just keep laughing.
It only makes him madder.
Start them off with the Touch of Death... and go from there.
I think they've learned their lesson, Lise.
We want to see the Touch of Death.
Come on, Karate Kid.
Waste me.
It's funny how two wrongs sometimes make a right.
Homer... over here.
Flanders, I want to give you your stuff back.
Well, there's no house to put it in, Homer.
Not since that nice fellow from the bank-- who was only doing his job-- came and locked it up.
You're living in your car?
Oh, no.
It's just a camp-out tonight... then off to my sister's apartment in Capital City.
What do you think, kids?
The big city.
[ Cheering ]
Todd, I want to talk to your Uncle Homer.
You're head of the car till I get back.
Okay, Dad.
Listen to that singing.
Those poor fools.
Homer, I'm ruined.
I know.
At times like these...
I used to turn to the Bible and find solace... but even the Good Book... can't help me now.
Why not?
I sold it to you for seven cents.
You know, ever since that barbecue... nothing's gone right.
It's like there's been... a curse on me.
[ Sobbing ]
It's all my fault.
No, it's not.
Yes, it is.
You tried to warn me... about gambling my family's future... on some pig in a poke.
I didn't listen.
Homer, you were a true friend.
No, I was a swine.
Listen, Flanders.
Do you still have that store?
For two more days.
Then it becomes Libertarian Party headquarters.
I hope they have better luck.
You open that store tomorrow.
Homer, there's no point.
I said do it!
Hello,Jerry?
Homer Simpson.
Remember last month when I paid back that loan?
Well, now I need you to do a favor for me.
A left-handed corkscrew?
Oh, baby.
"Kiss me-
- I'm left-handed?"
[ Laughs ]
That's a classic.
Whoa!
It's Homer Simpson.
Tell him I went out.
He needs you to help Ned Flanders.
Ned is in trouble?
!
Smithers, I'm licked.
You open this can.
Okay, but you softened it up for me.
Hold it, Smithers.
I'll open the can.
But, sir, how?
To the mall!
I'll explain on the way.
Hurry, Neddy, hurry.
Oh, golly, it's a miracle.
[ Homer] Come on, lefties.
What did I tell you?
Homer?
It's all here, and it's all backwards.
That's right.
[ Excited Voices Buzzing ]
The worm has turned, has it not, my tin-plated friend?
Look at you-- You who were once so proud.
Feel the wrath of the left hand of Burns.
My life today.
Wow!
What an icebreaker.
Left-handed ledgers.
Now, I can write all the way to the edge.
Aha!
Left-handed nunchukas.
Wow!
The boys at the Diners Club... will think I've gone quite mad.
Oh, I'll have that roadster as well.
[ Crowd Gasps ]
Yes, sir.
Huzzah for the shopkeep.
[ All ] Huzzah!
Homer, affordable tract housing made us neighbors... but you made us friends.
To Ned Flanders... the richest left-handed man in town.
Everybody!
- [ People Chattering ]
- Shh!
##Ahh, The Simpsons ##
D'oh!
Homer, you silly goose.
The weed-whacker's just for the edges.
You'll be out here all day.
I'm almost done.
You are a picture and a half.
If you're finished by tomorrow, come on over... and we'll put the heat to the meat.
Nummy-nummy-num!
I'll be there!
...Notty-notty-not.
"The Flanders are having a beef-a-thon!
Incredible Nedibles!
Maudacious vittles!"
I think it means he's having a barbecue.
Why doesn't he just say so?
!
He's trying to be friendly.
If you gave Ned Flanders a chance--
I don't care if he is the nicest guy in the world.
He's a jerk.
End of story.
We can't hold it against him... just because he has things better than we do.
Excuse me?
Better?
Thanks a lot, Marge.
You put me in my place.
Oh, Homer...
It's worth feeling three inches tall... to find out what kind of person you are...
Marge Simpson, president of the "We Love Flanders" fan club.
Fee, fi, fo, fum!
I smell the potatoes au gratin... of Marge Simpson.
Mm-mm-mm-mmm!
Hi, Ned.
Um...
Homer sends his apologies... but, um... there was some important work at the plant... that only he could take care of.
We now return to the Canadian Football League draft.
And so, the Rough Riders... who scored only four rouges all last season,Jack...
Stupid Flanders.
Go ahead, Marge.
Have a ball.
What if they came back... and I was dead from not eating?
They'd cry their eyes out.
"We should have never gone to the Flanders'.
"Why did we go to the Flanders' and leave Homer alone with no food?"
And I'd be laughing-- Laughing from my grave.
Heh, heh, heh.
What is it, boy?
What?
Mmm.
Barbecue.
Ahh.
Mmm.
Hey, I'm back.
Nice seeing you.
Hey!
Oh!
Hey, hey, Homer!
Ahmmffluhff...
Inside.
Okay.
Thanks for coming.
You're it.
Electricity.
Nuh-uh!
No electricity.
Only in freeze tag.
Okay.
Now you're it!
Hey!
No tag-backs!
Yeah, you cheater.
You lie like a fly... with a booger in its eye.
The fly was funny.
The booger was the icing on the cake.
Friends, we love you all... but I also have a sinister motive... for asking you all here...
"sinister" being Latin for left-handed.
But enough joking.
That was a joke?
Friday, I'm saying toodle-loo... to the pharmaceutical game.
- What's he talking about?
- Leaving?
No, I kid you not.
Here's the noose I had to wear for ten years.
What are you going to do?
Like one out of every nine Americans...
I'm left-handed, and let me tell you... it ain't all peaches and cream.
Your writing gets smeared.
Lord help you if you drive a standard transmission.
I'm opening up a one-stop store for southpaws.
Everything from left-handed apple peelers... to left-handed scissors.
Going to call it "The Leftorium."
So, Homer, I'm dying to know... what do you think ofthe Leftorium?
It sounds like a pretty dumb idea to me.
I know it's a little risky... and it's going to be a lot of hard work... but it's going to be a lot of fun too.
Fun?
Where is this store, Flanders?
The merry old land of Oz?
Oh, no.
The Springfield Mall.
Here, you two, make a wish.
Nah!
- It's fun.
- No, it isn't.
You must have something you want to wish for.
Hmm, let's see...
Nah.
Hmm...
Hey!
I've got an ambition to do some wishing'.
Keep your pants on, Flanders!
I'm wishing as fast as I can!
Ooh!
Heh, heh, heh, heh.
Eh... too far.
Hmm...
Okay, ready.
Yes!
Oh, yes!
Read it and weep!
In your face!
I've got more chicken bone!
What did you wish for?
No!
Don't say.
Otherwise, it won't come true.
Ooh, that would be a shame.
Wouldn't it, Flanders?
Mmm.
# Dum-da-dah... #
D'oh!
Bart... how many hours a day do you watch TV?
Six.
Seven if there's something good on.
Don't you think... you should get a little fresh air?
Yeah, but what are you going to do?
TV gives so much and asks so little.
It's a boy's best friend.
That's the problem.
Even as we speak... millions of children are staring at the TV... instead of getting some much-needed exercise.
Those children's parents... should be ashamed of themselves.
Hello, I am Akira.
Huahh!
That didn't hurt very much... because I know the ancient art of karate.
Karate focuses the mind and gives one self-confidence.
People from all walks of life:
- doctors...
-Hi-yaah!
- homemakers...
- Hu-yaah!
- landscape architects...
- Huhh-yah!
- choreographers...
- Haww.
High karate at low, low prices.
I cannot tell a lie.
This is a great deal.
Hohh!
Hey, Mom, how about... if I learn karate?
Will that make you happy?
That sounds fine.
See, you knock TV, and then it helps you out.
I think you owe somebody a little apology.
Well, if it isn't The Leftorium.
Hey, Flanders, how's business?
Oh, a little pokey... but things are going to pick up.
Oh!
I am so sorry.
How much do I owe you?
Now that was an accident.
Really?
Well, thanks.
Could you validate my parking?
Absitively posolutely.
So, Flanders, have you sold anything?
Not yet, but one of the mall security guards... took a long look... at a left-handed ice cream scoop.
Greetings, I am Akira... your guide on the path to true karate.
And this is our map, The Art of War by Sun Tzu.
It will teach us our most important lesson.
We learn karate, so we need never use it.
Um...
I already know how not to hit a guy.
Can we break out the nunchukus?
Yes, the impetuousness of youth.
For now, let us read.
When do we break blocks of ice with our heads?
First you must fill your head with wisdom.
Yo, Sensei, can I go to the bathroom?
You can if you believe you can.
Pay money to read books.
The hell with this.
Come on.
Touch of Death!
Touch of Death!
Hah, hah, hah!
I'm telling you.
Flanders' store was dee-serted.
What do you think of your bestest buddy now?
Dad, do you know what "schadenfreude" is?
No, I do not know what "schadenfreude" is.
Please tell me because I'm dying to know.
It's German for "shameful joy--"
taking pleasure in others' suffering.
I'm just glad to see him fall flat on his butt.
He's usually all happy and comfortable... and surrounded by loved ones, and it makes me feel--
What's the opposite of that "shameful joy" thing of yours?
Sour grapes.
Those Germans have... a word for everything.
What did you learn in karate school?
Yeah, this better be worth my ten bucks.
Uh...
I learned the Touch of Death.
Ooh, the Touch of Death.
Permit me to demonstrate.
Lisa, shut your eyes.
Soon you will be at peace.
Hey, quit it, Bart. Quit it.
Quit it!
Quit it!
Quit it!
Mom!
Don't use the Touch of Death on your sister.
Uh-oh!
Got to get back to karate class.
Missed a spot.
Dopey kid.
Coming through.
Step aside, lady.
Mmm, baby.
How was class?
We learned how to rip a man's heart out... and show it to him before he dies.
That will learn them.
What did you swipe?
An "I Love Lefty" glass.
Left-handed pinking shears.
Pinking shears?
Let's go to the food court and steal... some baked potatoes.
Hey, Flanders, when are your busy hours?
I expect things to pick up soon.
I think word of mouth is starting to spread.
I hear you... validate parking tickets without purchase.
Oh, right as rain.
Or as we say around here, "left as rain."
Just stamp it.
Okay.
Hey, Homer, how's your neighbor's store doing?
Lousy.
He just sits there all day.
He'd have a great job if he didn't own the place.
Crummy right-handed corkscrews.
What does he sell?
Uh... well, actually, Moe, uh...
I don't know.
Lise, change the channel.
You change it.
Ooowaaah...
Okay, okay.
I grow weary of this new channel.
Change it back.
But, Bart...
Eeeyaahhh...
Apple... apple... apple...
Come on, candy bar.
Hey, you're that first apple I didn't want.
That sinks it.
I'm really going to let them have it this time.
Simpson, put that box on Mr. Burns' desk.
Chop-chop!
Oh, look, Smithers.
Another member of our nuclear family... with some helpful suggestions.
And what's your name?
Homer Simpson, sir.
Simpson, eh?
Mm-hmm.
I'm Monty Burns.
"Keep that handsome owner out of sight.
He's distracting the female employees."
Smithers?
Got me, sir.
Oh, it's a real one.
"No more apples in the vending machine, please."
Well, that's almost a sentence.
Can I leave?
Of course, and don't worry.
There will be plenty of apples for you.
Nobody will take away your precious apples.
The note was asking you to--
No, tell my secretary I said you could have a free apple.
She'll make everything all right.
I promise.
Damned infernal gizmo.
My kingdom for a left-handed can opener!
Uh, Mr. Burns...
Come on, Homer.
Tell him about the store.
I'm dying out here.
Sorry, Flanders.
Huh?
Are you sure... you're not interested?
$200 is only the asking price.
Sorry, Ned.
Hey, I'm flexible.
You don't have to pay all at once.
I'll be here all night if you change your mind.
Hey, Flanders, is everything okay?
Oh, yeah, sure.
See anything you like?
Oh, it's not good enough for you... but it's good enough for me?
I wouldn't be caught dead buying this...
Hello.
Got your eye on the gas grill, huh?
She's a butane beaut.
I'll give you 20.
Homer, I paid $300 for this just last year.

What?
!
It was... a passing fancy.
Although, if you threw in a few lawn chairs... maybe that tool bench, it might rekindle my interest.
Hey, Bartely-boobely.
Care for a steakarooni?
Sounds scrum-diddley-umptious, dear old duddely-doodely.
[ Homer] Duddely-doodely.
This is the Flanders' living room set.
What did you pay for this?
Only 7 5 beans.
$7 5?

I'm sure you did nothing to discourage this... you scavenger of human misery.

Give that back!
That to me!
If you want it, take it.
Okay.

When do we break blocks of ice with our heads?
First you must fill your head with wisdom.
Yo, Sensei, can I go to the bathroom?
You can if you believe you can.
Pay money to read books.
The hell with this.
Come on.
Touch of Death!
Touch of Death!
Hah, hah, hah!
I'm telling you.
Flanders' store was dee-serted.
What do you think of your bestest buddy now?
Dad, do you know what "schadenfreude" is?
No, I do not know what "schadenfreude" is.
Please tell me because I'm dying to know.
It's German for "shameful joy--"
taking pleasure in others' suffering.
I'm just glad to see him fall flat on his butt.
He's usually all happy and comfortable... and surrounded by loved ones, and it makes me feel--
What's the opposite of that "shameful joy" thing of yours?
Sour grapes.
Those Germans have... a word for everything.
What did you learn in karate school?
Yeah, this better be worth my ten bucks.
Uh...
I learned the Touch of Death.
Ooh, the Touch of Death.
Permit me to demonstrate.
Lisa, shut your eyes.
Soon you will be at peace.
Hey, quit it, Bart. Quit it.
Quit it!
Quit it!
Quit it!
Mom!
Don't use the Touch of Death on your sister.
Uh-oh!
Got to get back to karate class.
Missed a spot.
Dopey kid.
Coming through.
Step aside, lady.
Mmm, baby.
How was class?
We learned how to rip a man's heart out... and show it to him before he dies.
That will learn them.
What did you swipe?
An "I Love Lefty" glass.
Left-handed pinking shears.
Pinking shears?
Let's go to the food court and steal... some baked potatoes.
Hey, Flanders, when are your busy hours?
I expect things to pick up soon.
I think word of mouth is starting to spread.
I hear you... validate parking tickets without purchase.
Oh, right as rain.
Or as we say around here, "left as rain."
Just stamp it.
Okay.
Hey, Homer, how's your neighbor's store doing?
Lousy.
He just sits there all day.
He'd have a great job if he didn't own the place.
Crummy right-handed corkscrews.
What does he sell?
Uh... well, actually, Moe, uh...
I don't know.
Lise, change the channel.
You change it.
Ooowaaah...
Okay, okay.
I grow weary of this new channel.
Change it back.
But, Bart...
Eeeyaahhh...
Apple... apple... apple...
Come on, candy bar.
Hey, you're that first apple I didn't want.
That sinks it.
I'm really going to let them have it this time.
Simpson, put that box on Mr. Burns' desk.
Chop-chop!
Oh, look, Smithers.
Another member of our nuclear family... with some helpful suggestions.
And what's your name?
Homer Simpson, sir.
Simpson, eh?
Mm-hmm.
I'm Monty Burns.
"Keep that handsome owner out of sight.
He's distracting the female employees."
Smithers?
Got me, sir.
Oh, it's a real one.
"No more apples in the vending machine, please."
Well, that's almost a sentence.
Can I leave?
Of course, and don't worry.
There will be plenty of apples for you.
Nobody will take away your precious apples.
The note was asking you to--
No, tell my secretary I said you could have a free apple.
She'll make everything all right.
I promise.
Damned infernal gizmo.
My kingdom for a left-handed can opener!
Uh, Mr. Burns...
Come on, Homer.
Tell him about the store.
I'm dying out here.
Sorry, Flanders.
Huh?
Are you sure... you're not interested?
$200 is only the asking price.
Sorry, Ned.
Hey, I'm flexible.
You don't have to pay all at once.
I'll be here all night if you change your mind.
Hey, Flanders, is everything okay?
Oh, yeah, sure.
See anything you like?
Oh, it's not good enough for you... but it's good enough for me?
I wouldn't be caught dead buying this...
Hello.
Got your eye on the gas grill, huh?
She's a butane beaut.
I'll give you 20.
Homer, I paid $300 for this just last year.
$20.
Take it or leave it.
Oh, Homer, be reasonable.
Sorry, no cash for Neddy.
Homer keep all money.
Bye-bye, Neddy.
All right, Homer.
$20?
$20.
I don't want it.
What?
!
It was... a passing fancy.
Although, if you threw in a few lawn chairs... maybe that tool bench, it might rekindle my interest.
Hey, Bartely-boobely.
Care for a steakarooni?
Sounds scrum-diddley-umptious, dear old duddely-doodely.
[ Homer] Duddely-doodely.
This is the Flanders' living room set.
What did you pay for this?
Only 7 5 beans.
$7 5?
Ned must be desperate.
I'm sure you did nothing to discourage this... you scavenger of human misery.
Hey!
Keep your hands off my china hutch.
I'm Chuck Ellis... from the Springfield Collection Agency... and I'm here to ask you why you don't think... you need to pay your bills?
Oh, I know I need to pay them, but there's just so many.
Do you feel good owing money?
We've been very patient with you, Mr. Flanders.
I know, but-
- Wait a minute.
I'm Homer Simpson.
Ned Flanders lives over there.
Oh.
Flanders is in debt?
Are you sure?
We don't make mistakes.
Damned right-handed ledgers.
I can't write in these things.
There's a store...
You're Homer Simpson?
See you Thursday.
D'oh!
Knock 'em dead, boy.
Kid's going to be a black belt in no time.
Ohhh...
Check out the saxophone.
Pretty boss... but something's stuck on it.
Hey!
Hey, look at me.
I'm Elvis, man!
Give that back!
That to me!
If you want it, take it.
Okay.
We're sorry.
This time, we're really going to give it to you.
Hey, stop that!
Hey, Lise, something wrong?
Not anymore!
You punks are about to get... a taste of your own medicine.
This is my brother, and he knows karate.
Uh-oh.
Oh, we're real scared.
Please don't hurt us, Bart.
What are you going to do?
Throw your diapers at us?
Just keep laughing.
It only makes him madder.
Start them off with the Touch of Death... and go from there.
I think they've learned their lesson, Lise.
We want to see the Touch of Death.
Come on, Karate Kid.
Waste me.
It's funny how two wrongs sometimes make a right.
Homer... over here.
Flanders, I want to give you your stuff back.
Well, there's no house to put it in, Homer.
Not since that nice fellow from the bank-- who was only doing his job-- came and locked it up.
You're living in your car?
Oh, no.
It's just a camp-out tonight... then off to my sister's apartment in Capital City.
What do you think, kids?
The big city.
Todd, I want to talk to your Uncle Homer.
You're head of the car till I get back.
Okay, Dad.
Listen to that singing.
Those poor fools.
Homer, I'm ruined.
I know.
At times like these...
I used to turn to the Bible and find solace... but even the Good Book... can't help me now.
Why not?
I sold it to you for seven cents.
You know, ever since that barbecue... nothing's gone right.
It's like there's been... a curse on me.
It's all my fault.
No, it's not.
Yes, it is.
You tried to warn me... about gambling my family's future... on some pig in a poke.
I didn't listen.
Homer, you were a true friend.
No, I was a swine.
Listen, Flanders.
Do you still have that store?
For two more days.
Then it becomes Libertarian Party headquarters.
I hope they have better luck.
You open that store tomorrow.
Homer, there's no point.
I said do it!
Hello,Jerry?
Homer Simpson.
Remember last month when I paid back that loan?
Well, now I need you to do a favor for me.
A left-handed corkscrew?
Oh, baby.
"Kiss me-
- I'm left-handed?"
That's a classic.
Whoa!
It's Homer Simpson.
Tell him I went out.
He needs you to help Ned Flanders.
Ned is in trouble?
!
Smithers, I'm licked.
You open this can.
Okay, but you softened it up for me.
Hold it, Smithers.
I'll open the can.
But, sir, how?
To the mall!
I'll explain on the way.
Hurry, Neddy, hurry.
Oh, golly, it's a miracle.
Come on, lefties.
What did I tell you?
Homer?
It's all here, and it's all backwards.
That's right.
The worm has turned, has it not, my tin-plated friend?
Look at you-- You who were once so proud.
Feel the wrath of the left hand of Burns.
My life today.
Wow!
What an icebreaker.
Left-handed ledgers.
Now, I can write all the way to the edge.
Aha!
Left-handed nunchukas.
Wow!
The boys at the Diners Club... will think I've gone quite mad.
Oh, I'll have that roadster as well.
Yes, sir.
Huzzah for the shopkeep.
Huzzah!
Homer, affordable tract housing made us neighbors... but you made us friends.
To Ned Flanders... the richest left-handed man in town.
Everybody!
- Shh!
Good evening and welcome back to Election '90 at Channel 3.
The polls have just closed in Connecticut...
Drinks coming through.
Stop it!
- We got it!
- We got Bridgeport!
Did you hear that?
We got Bridgeport.
I knew it.
Hey, Pete, Channel 8.
This is Connecticut News Tonight with the Election '90 Special News.
Telephone.
Telephone, Tim.
Thank you.
Hello.
Yeah, Tom.
Yeah.
I hope so.
About 15 minutes or so.
With 53% of the precincts reporting in,
Channel 8 now projects that three-time incumbent Senator James B Stiles has defeated Stuart Hutchinson, giving Senator Stiles a fourth term.
In that close race for the fourth Congressional district, the Gold Coast, both our exit polls and the precincts already reporting in...
Showtime!
Peter.
Peter Tomorrow's-looking-good Burton, a man I loved, the kind without the mousetraps of sex and marriage, spared the contortions that families require.
The love men can have for one another, love without need, struck in acquaintance, built on friendship, and fulfilled in joy at the other's accomplishment.
We have projections in the races for the sixth and fourth districts...
God, if only it were that simple.
All yours.
Thank you.
- What?
!
- Shit!
- Damn it!
- That's it!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Witness!
Witness!
Witness!
Negligent!
- Sorry.
- Sorry doesn't make her cherry again.
- Are you blind?
- You pulled into my spot.
It's just a dent.
It's not a big fucking deal!
It's just a dent?
Maybe on your car, farmer, but on mine...
Nobody solved problems with violence.
That's what's wrong with the world.
Come on, break it up!
Stop it, this is so macho!
Hey, how are you doing?
I'm...
- Get out of my room!
- Your room?
- This is my room!
- This is my room!
42, I'm afraid so.
- I don't believe this.
- Jesus!
OK, look, what if I apologise, OK?
You're right, it was my fault.
I'm sorry.
Really, OK?
No hard feelings.
Why fight if it was your fault?
First impressions are important.
I slink out of my car and say,
"Here I am, folks.
Say hi to a total asshole"?
No.
I stand up for myself.
- I create doubt as to whose fault it was.
- That's what you were doing?
I got the dented car, not you.
It's no skin off your nose.
- Everybody makes out, right?
- Wrong.
First law school, then you become a sleazebag with no regard for the truth.
- I've met guys like you before.
- Yeah?
You got that face, got that smile, got that corduroy suit that comes with elbow patches.
You got one of those suits?
So what?
Just curious.
- Which is 42?
- Over there.
Tim!
Garrity, come on.
You can run but you can't hide.
Stubblefield?
You dog, I heard an ugly rumour you were going to be here.
Tim Garrity, you'll never amount to anything.
- Your mother and I are disappointed.
- You'll have to try harder, that's all.
- How you doing?
- Great.
You?
- BJ said there was a fight.
See it?
- No...
Yeah, a guy got what was coming to him and will live in shame for ever.
- I'm sorry I missed it...
- Sorry, Doug Stubblefield, Peter Burton.
Good to know you.
I got a keg on ice, you won't believe who's here, so let's go.
I'll be there.
- Anyone you want to ask?
- Girls?
The place is crawling with them.
If you want, I can go and see about changing rooms.
I'd understand.
I got a colour TV and subscriptions to Time and National Geographic.
Three credit cards and a guy at Hialeah phones me sure things.
- I'm Tim Garrity.
- Peter Burton.
- Want to come to Stubblefield's?
- No, don't want to butt in.
Come on.
He's a jerk, all right, so consider it punishment.
- Come on.
- OK.
- Where are you from?
- Providence, Rhode Island.
You?
All over.
We moved around a lot.
- College?
- Georgetown.
You?
UConn.
Ignorantia juris non excusat.
"Lgnorance of the law is no excuse." Robinson versus Virginia.
All right, ladies and gentlemen, who can give me the facts of the case?
Mr Burton.
Proximate cause.
Train conductor pushes a passenger.
Guy's carrying firecrackers.
Falls to the ground.
Exploding, injuring bystander.
Foreseeability?
The railroad company couldn't foresee the box containing fireworks or that their employee's actions could cause injury.
The reasonable man's standard?
Foreseeability and proximate cause make for a reasonable man?
We may not always get what we want or what we need, just so's we don't get what we deserve.
- So her parents were down the hall?
- We're not fucking in the living room!
I wouldn't imply anything as base and vulgar as that.
Let me get this straight.
It's breakfast.
You're sitting with Senator and Mrs Stiles.
The happy millionaires eat breakfast, Diana's there, apple of Dad's eyes...
Stamford.
He pulls those telegenic blue eyes on you and says what?
- Good morning.
- You're missing something.
- What do you do at a girlfriend's?
- They're not senators' daughters.
- Where are you going?
- London, in fact.
My parents are in Geneva.
Some World Bank thing.
Christmas in London?
Plum pudding and Marley's ghost.
It's mostly Arabs and rain.
I'm flying into New York.
Want to get together?
The Stiles throw this famous New Year's Eve party.
I want you to meet Diana.
Here, let me give you the number.
Nobody has a pen in this situation.
What a guy!
- Hey, don't forget your stuff.
- Merry Christmas!
Three turkey white.
Two turtle doves...
And a partridge in a pear tree
17.84.
- You really got to go?
- I still got some presents to buy.
Believe it or not.
Talk about last minute.
Plus, I promised my sister-in-law I'd make the desserts.
I'd ask you to come, but it's just family.
Sorry.
I hate to see someone alone on Christmas Eve.
- Will you be OK?
- I'll be fine.
Merry Christmas.
And they sing of Christmas.
Bah, humbug!
Might as well close shop for the night.
We'll finish tomorrow.
But, sir, tomorrow is Christmas Day.
- Tim!
Pete.
- Hey, how are you doing?
- Good.
How are you?
- How was London?
- Great.
It snowed and everything.
- So, where are you now?
New York City.
I've got to visit my aunt and uncle in Hartford tomorrow.
I was wondering if I could stop in and say hi.
Come up here New Year's Eve.
I checked, it's fine.
Got a tux?
- Sure, no problem.
- All right.
Let me give you directions.
- Take the Triborough Bridge...
- Hold on, let me get a pen.
- OK, go.
- New England Freeway to exit four...
- All right, tomorrow afternoon?
- See you tomorrow.
You the owner?
- You want a tux at 9 a.
M?
- Why would I call you at home?
- Cash or credit card?
- Big cash.
- Thanks a lot.
- OK, come on in.
Hey, stop that.
- I'm starving.
- We need champagne.
Diana, can you get your father?
- Have you seen my father?
- No.
- Diana, Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!
- Excuse me.
Where's Daddy?
- In there, wrestling with Burt Tuck.
...not the doctors...
- Burt, you're wrong.
You're full of shit.
The AMA has got to realise people don't give a rat's ass about that, when a simple appendectomy costs $6,000.
Where does it say Congress answers to the AMA and not to their electorate?
- I'm sorry I interrupted.
- It's all right.
Go on.
People don't want AMA deciding on health any more than Exxon running the Interior Department.
You ever been on an AMA golf outing, son?
- No, Senator.
- Well, take Dr Tuck here.
He'll fix your bursitis, sharpen up your short game, wipe out your campaign debt before you're off the first green.
Yes, Senator.
You're right.
You're there to represent the people who elected you.
But to do that you've got to get elected, and that takes money.
So, every day you try to remember where you drew the line.
- What's your name?
- Peter Burton.
I'm at UVA with Tim.
- Nice to meet you, Peter.
- It's an honour.
Now that you've given me indigestion, Burt, let's eat.
Finally!
I'm starving.
You did fine.
I'm John Lawry.
I'm an aide to the senator.
Peter Burton.
I was just reading your profile in the Washingtonian.
- Just?
- Just recently.
The article was in a year and a half ago.
Some stack in the library.
You prepare for everything the way you prepare for parties?
John, let's get something to eat.
Could you pass these around?
Peter!
A special hat for you.
Looks good.
- Bathroom's there.
- Just wanted to get out of the crowd.
Have you seen Tim?
Deep into it with some guy from Justice.
That's not "some guy".
That's the Deputy Attorney General.
It's like the National Review come to life in there.
And are you impressed by that?
Yes, I am.
- How was London?
- Oh, great.
Fantastic.
- You went to school there?
- I've still got lots of friends there.
Shuttle them in for the party?
- You don't remind me of James Dean.
- What?
You remind Tim of James Dean.
If James Dean was a graduate grind.
Tim likes to make the basically boring glamorous.
No offence.
- None taken.
- There you are.
Give me the last kiss of '83.
I haven't seen that much log-rolling since my father's poker games.
What's log-rolling?
Compromising the duties of office under the guise of expediency.
Government by cheques and cocktails.
- A system that's worked for 200 years.
- I said nothing about your dad.
- Don't start.
- One minute to go!
- Resolutions?
- Find a good margarita in Georgetown.
- Cop out!
- You?
- Too young and powerless to mention.
- OK, next decade?
Prosecuting half the guest list.
To be in Congress within 10 years.
- That's it?
- But I mean it.
- Is this expensive?
- About $80.
I'll make a bet with you.
Election night '90.
If I win, you each owe me a bottle, by hand.
- If not?
- I'll bring you a case.
Just send mine.
I won't want to be around you the day after you lost.
Happy New Year!
Happy New Year, Pete.
Happy New Year!
My turn, Tim.
- What's wrong with this party?
- Who told you about it?
I smoked a joint with the caterer.
It's drug-induced?
Can we drive around for hours looking for a diner?
Usher in the New Year with adults and you'll become one.
- Where is this joint?
- Over by Bridgeport.
- Here we are.
- This looks shitty.
- Let's go to Greenwich.
- It's worse.
- One drink.
- We won't stay long, I promise.
They've written "Party" three times on the marquee.
How bad can it be?
- They've clearly pulled out all the stops.
- OK, OK!
Two draughts, two shooters of Jack and a Baileys.
- Jack?
- Yeah.
Browns for my friend.
No, Browns for my friend.
Petey Bertkowski?
Is that Petey Bertkowski?
Jesus!
Out of my way!
Coming through!
Out of my way!
Bertkowski!
Petey Bertkowski!
Jesus!
Todd!
- Short hair!
It's been a long time.
- Yeah, a long time.
I saw your dad.
I work for the city and he worked with us.
A big snowstorm before Thanksgiving.
- We're just leaving.
- Seen Janine?
- I know she'll want to talk to you.
- Say hi to her...
Baby!
Janine, honey!
Baby!
Janine!
Come on!
We're married now.
We got two kids and it's good.
Hey, Peter.
Hey, Janine.
You look good.
You, too.
Different.
Happy New Year.
It's good seeing you guys.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.
Happy New Year.
Let's belly up here.
Couple of beers!
- Just don't judge me, OK?
- I don't even know your name.
Peter Michael Bertkowski.
Born, New Haven, March 91959, to Mike and Irene.
The mother left when he was ten.
The father, a Cutty Sark fan, raised the boy, working sporadically around the holidays.
People got the charitable urge.
Where were you Christmas?
School.
- Why did you lie to me?
- I thought you wouldn't be my friend.
Why would you think that I'd give a shit about stuff like that?
Most people don't see the world with the same eyes you do.
They're not so sure who they are, not so happy with who they are.
You don't have to lie to me.
- You don't understand, man.
- Why don't you let me try?
I'm sorry, Tim.
The thing is, these personal traits of your father's, some you can't stand, these come out in you.
There's nothing you can do, any more than you can about getting his ears or his hairline...
You know, last weekend, right.
Diana, little thing.
Dinner before the movie.
Turns into a fight, no other reason than me sticking to a goddamn plan.
My father exactly.
How?
He ran his house the same way he runs his courtroom:
Confusing stubbornness with strength.
I knew what she meant.
Got even madder denying it.
Do you have any idea what I'm talking about?
But you don't have to become your old man.
It's not inevitable.
Not if you fight it with everything you got.
- Hey, Tim.
Timmy!
- Yeah?
- Mine came!
- You got it!
All right.
OK, on three.
Good luck!
One, two, three!
- OK. "Department of Justice..." - "After a considerable number..."
- "inform you of your acceptance..."!
- "...staff of Senator James B Stiles"!
Washington!
Yes.
Look around.
Here we are.
A lady writes, "Dear Senator, My Oscar is a great admirer of yours,
"and every time you come on the TV he sits in front to watch.
"And when they applaud your speech he barks right along."
Oscar's her fucking dog!
Now, "Oscar has been sick.
"Could the senator find time to have a photograph taken with him?
"It would mean so much, you know."
Don't everybody look at once.
Senator Frank Steubens with an unidentified blonde.
Laminated.
Jesus!
- Jesus!
- She's a lobbyist.
America's family man toasted with a blonde at Wah Fong's.
I like the papers on the table.
Nice touch.
Working dinner.
They're drawing up a proposal introducing his member into her historic chamber.
- You wished you'd said it.
- All right.
I wish Stiles was here.
We got a bill Steubens' committee's been blocking.
I'd love to see the senator march over and lobby him with Blondie sitting there.
Why don't you do it?
You're the real brains in Stiles's office.
We know it, but Steubens doesn't yet.
- Take a vacation!
- Drink your drink!
Get him out of here.
Taxi!
We're going to Ronnie and Nancy's.
Want to come?
- Bye.
- Goodnight.
Kentucky plates.
Russell Building parking sticker.
Steubens' car.
Wow!
Now I've seen it all.
Can we go now?
- Get the jack out of the trunk.
- What for?
Peter, what the fuck are you doing?
Oh, no!
Yeah, they got me, too.
Senator Steubens?
Tim, it's Senator Steubens.
Senator, I'm a great, great admirer of yours.
Oh, very nice to meet you, sir.
Miss Winston.
- Peter.
- Hi.
Must be a Democratic precinct.
Let me change your tyre.
Oh, no, I couldn't ask you to do that.
- Just take my car.
- I couldn't.
I'm an aide to Senator Stiles.
Stiles?
Good people, Stiles.
Good people.
I could just run up to your office tomorrow, exchange keys.
It would be an honour, Senator.
- I don't know...
- Let's accept.
You think so, honey?
OK.
Thank you.
Just let me have a word with our good friend here.
Hold that, honey.
- Nice meeting you.
- You, too.
- Peter Burton, Senator.
- Just call me Frank, Pete.
- I know what this looks like.
- Like a senator working late.
I know what it looks like.
Don't yank my chain.
- No, Frank.
- Just between us men.
- Can't stress the importance.
- No need, Frank.
Thank you.
Pete.
Thank you again.
Come on, honey.
Senator.
- Thank you.
- Goodnight.
Frank, hurry.
- The moves on this kid!
- You stuck his tyre.
That's a crime.
OK, so I created a situation.
So what?
I did him a favour, equals Stiles did him a favour.
So he's on our dance card in a close vote.
What's wrong?
It's wrong.
You think the Department of Justice never cuts corners?
It's a new day.
- What the fuck does that mean?
- Don't get caught.
Lighten up.
I didn't break into Watergate.
I let the air out of a tyre.
It's kids' stuff.
Baker's moving to excuse Standish, so we've got to get into his involvement with the pipeline contracts.
Hammer Standish when he twists his watch.
What?
Every time he takes the Fifth or "can't recall", he twists it.
Like those Lebanese lobbying answers.
He twists his watch, come down hard.
Hey, Pete.
- Your boss is writing "kick me" on this.
- Afternoon, Frank.
- You know Peter?
- Met last night.
We had a nice chat about your amendment to the Appropriations Bill.
Listen, Jim.
Walk back with me after the hearing.
I think we can talk.
See you inside.
Yeah.
- Will you tell me what that was about?
- No time.
We'd better get inside.
I told Mrs Santana we'd be out of the apartment Monday morning.
- Did she rent it?
- I don't know.
Why?
I'm staying, Tim.
I'm not going back to school.
- You're kidding?
- No.
We're in the best school there is.
College of Ways and Means, DC.
- Let's go.
- Let's do it.
- Take 'em.
- Good shot!
- Are you sure it's OK?
- Yes, I was nodding off, too.
Dinner's not for an hour, so we can walk...
Or just get a bite.
No, I'm not hungry!
- I'm getting fat anyway.
- You are not!
- Maybe if we walked I'd be hungry.
- It's OK.
I'm sorry.
You put this big night together and I'm being a creep.
- What's the matter?
- We're about to be separated again.
And I'm thinking maybe that's not such a bad thing.
- What?
- I don't know where it's going.
It's going fine.
What is this?
Just because you say it's fine, doesn't make it fine.
OK.
OK.
I'm listening.
Well...
Why are you so set on Justice?
Isn't there another track?
- Why be out of the loop?
- Ass-kiss your way to the middle?
That's not what it is.
My parents have a wonderful life in it.
- You're one of the best.
- You think the DOJ is for rejects?
No, I'm not saying that.
I don't want to spend my life trying to get votes.
If you're happy with your programme, fine.
But it's not mine, or ours.
I can't say I'd be happy being basically a cop's wife.
Not a cop, an attorney.
No one said anything about marriage.
I hate the way I sound, but I have to say these things.
We have to think about them.
So, I'll call you when I'm in town next.
I didn't mean to hurt you.
I love you.
Let's get out of here.
I'm going to the bathroom.
Wait for me, OK?
Yeah.
- I knew it was no before I could ask.
- Did she give you a reason?
My career plans aren't glamorous enough.
It seems like that matters.
- What will you do?
- Try and fall out of love with her.
She loves you.
It's obvious.
If she loses you over some agenda, then she doesn't deserve you.
- Am I right?
- Peter.
- Could I speak with you?
- Certainly, John.
- Hi, Tim.
- Hi.
- What's up?
- I just came from Steubens' office.
- Is he behaving himself?
- Maybe you want to talk in private.
Tim's my brother.
He's going to hear it anyway.
Here it is.
Don't you ever, ever go trying to make some deal for the senator's office.
You want to play maverick, take it somewhere else.
If you're staying, you go through channels.
Got me?
- Got you.
- Good.
The campaign staff in Connecticut is spread too thin.
We need a hand.
Take the shuttle to New York, then the train to New Haven.
- Someone will pick you up.
- Decoration committee?
- Fundamentals.
Something you missed.
- Ask you one thing?
- Quickly.
- Is Steubens with the amendment?
- That's not the point.
- I know.
I don't think you do.
Yes.
He's fucking with me.
It's personal.
Now I have to find a way round him.
Shouldn't be too hard.
40 years old and he's still an aide.
Dresses like a leftover campus radical.
John Denver-looking motherf...
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Lyndon Johnson once told me that a good speech is measured by how quickly it gets the audience on its feet.
So, the owner of the black Mercedes with Connecticut plates, your lights are on.
Sorry about that.
Not staying for the rest of the speech?
No.
I just wanted to see how my joke went over.
Been here since eight in the morning.
Goodnight.
Where are you going?
I'm going to sneak over that fence, take off my clothes and float in that pool.
I'd ask you, but I hate hearing no.
How do you know I'd say no?
'Cause I don't think those looks you've been dealing me add up to you actually doing anything.
I think you're a daddy's girl.
And she doesn't fool around with the help.
- Got me all figured out, huh?
- Tell me I'm wrong.
You're wrong.
- What about Tim?
- What about Tim?
- What are we going to tell him?
- Nothing.
We were both curious.
You've been in my bed every night this week.
That's more than curious.
This doesn't have anything to do with Tim.
You going back with him?
Peter, I love Tim.
Whether or not I can be with him, I don't know.
Whatever happens, you're not part of it.
You don't want to be.
You're his best friend.
What if you're what I want?
- What if I fall in love with you?
- God, no.
No, no, no.
- This is screwed up enough as it is.
- I could.
You could fall in love with me, too.
- Stop it.
I don't think so.
- Why?
I'm not good enough?
- Come on, Peter.
- Just say that you could love me.
- No.
- Just say it.
Just say it.
No!
They pay peanuts with 2 weeks a year?
- I just started.
It gets better.
- I know waiters with better deals.
- Who'd you say your friend was?
- John Palmeri.
A developer.
Took a big initiative for Stiles last election.
A big initiative?
- A lot of cash and kicked labour butt.
- Did you let him borrow your car?
That's very funny.
He needed the senator's ear, I was able to help and here we are.
I'm not an intern any more.
I got my own relationship with the senator.
Chief Administrative Aide.
Thank you.
- You're right on schedule, aren't you?
- First vacation in two years.
- I'll beat you skiing, too.
- I don't ski on the bunny slopes.
- Think I need a lesson?
- Three or four.
You don't have to decide now.
- If you get tired slogging...
- Slogging?
Turtling...
I got you a slot with Stiles.
Me and you together.
- Me under you?
- No, I show you the ropes.
In a week, you'll be writing laws, not looking them up.
- Enforcing them.
- Try it.
- Why do you want me there?
- For the future.
For when I make the run.
I don't kid myself.
I'm Mr Shine.
Give me a baby to kiss and a filmmaker to shoot it, I'll be in.
- I'll need my legal eagle.
- I like what I do.
Somebody hurts someone, steals from them, I can right it.
- That's very liberating.
- Why are you so naive?
- Your Washington is not mine.
- You're wrong, man.
It's all the same ball game.
Even at Justice.
You need to realise that.
If you're that good, you'll have plenty of men to pick from.
If I can ever help from where I am, all you've got to do is ask.
All right?
- Last run.
- Damn, did we do this week up!
Yeah, we did.
God, look at that.
Listen, Tim, I've got to talk to you about something.
About seeing somebody.
I haven't been straight.
I haven't...
Diana.
I've been with Diana.
After you went back to school, I was around her, around the campaign.
- It's been on and off for a year.
- And now?
- I'm going to ask her to marry me.
- That's your relationship with Stiles?
- Don't think that.
- What am I supposed to think?
It just happened.
I'm taking this.
If you want an easier run, I'll meet you at the bottom.
- Last run.
We've got to ski it together.
- It's up to you.
Follow if you want.
Shit!
Pete, stop!
No!
Stop!
Just fall over!
Ski patrol!
Ski patrol!
- Don't move.
- My fucking leg!
Ski patrol's on its way.
I didn't hear you soon enough.
I know you were yelling.
- I'm sorry.
- I couldn't hear.
I know you were there.
I know you meant to warn me.
- I know you were trying to help.
- I'm sorry.
Ski patrol!
You know with Diana I never meant to hurt you.
You know that?
- Right?
- Yes.
Ski patrol!
Oh, fuck!
Don't move.
Be my best man.
- Good?
- Yes.
So I was absolved of trying to kill my best friend.
And he was acquitted of snaking the only girl that really mattered to me.
Even frozen and in shock, one leg mangled and two ribs cracked,
Peter Burton could cut himself a deal.
Louise, that's crazy.
We could hold fundraisers forever.
It wouldn't make up for that kind of cut.
Don't do this!
You pull out on this vote and I'm screwed!
- Hold on.
Diana.
- One minute.
Could you hold on?
- Warrilow's told Peckheiser to vote no.
- Dick's cutting Meals for Millions.
- Do I care?
- David!
Louise, hi, Peter.
And to you.
Don't tell me he feels terrible.
He's going to look terrible if Diana's forced to fight him.
- OK.
Louise.
- David.
Yes, isn't he?
I'm back in a week.
Hold him until then.
I'll get my father involved and we'll figure it out.
You're a saint.
Great.
Love to the kids.
Bye.
Yes!
And this must be Palmeri Bay.
Officially it's still Long Island Sound, but we're working on it!
- What do you think?
- It's beautiful.
I'm glad you like it.
It's yours.
- That was easy.
Let's look at Porsches.
- I'm serious.
I know you're going to love it here.
Especially you, Diana.
- Thank you, but...
- But nothing.
I'm looking forward at a man who's going to be my Congressman.
He needs to establish residency in this district.
- I couldn't afford this place.
- Your campaign fund can.
- What campaign fund?
- The exploratory money I'm raising.
A portion will be allocated for housing and office space.
This is it.
- Too good to be true?
- There's nothing unethical about it.
If that's what you're worried about.
This is done a lot.
- I didn't know that.
- You live, you learn.
- Diana, I want to show you the rest.
- Sure.
This is the master bedroom.
Most rooms face the water...
If you're not comfortable with it, just hand those keys back.
The important thing is I want to help you, work with you.
- Any time you're uncomfortable, say no.
- Any time, on anything?
Absolutely.
We're bidding for a federally-funded low-income project for Bridgeport.
It's a fair bid and we want the job, but we've got competition.
- You said you've a friend at Justice.
- A good buddy.
- I don't trust him.
- That's prejudice.
No, instinct.
- If his name was Winthrop...
- That's prejudice!
- He's a respected businessman.
- He's a silk suit with tax scams.
You don't trust him because he fought to get where he is.
- He sees something in me.
- So do I, Peter.
I married you.
Quit trying to tear me down.
I'm just trying to get us where we want to be.
- Unbelievable.
- Congratulations.
- Take care.
Bye.
- See you later.
- Are others as guilty as Wagstaff?
- Did you think they'd convict?
Are you satisfied Wagstaff's as high as it went?
I can't answer questions because of the appeal.
I have a statement.
Wagstaff's conviction is not only proof that the system works, but that it can work across the board.
No matter how high up, you're still accountable.
I thank the jury, local prosecutors and everyone who came forward.
I've a message to the Orlando Sentinel:
Garrity, two Rs and a Y.
- What are you doing here?
- Taking Dick Tracy to the Super Bowl.
- 623.
We're here on the left.
- This is great!
- He promised me the 50-yard line.
- Where'd you get the tickets?
Business Round Table.
The NRA's got a sky-box.
Maybe we can hang around there the second half.
Why are you wasting the Super Bowl on a lowly DOJ attorney?
Maybe I did waste them.
Fuck you.
I never see you now.
I'm sorry.
It's this weekend.
Everybody's brown-nosing.
I feel like the third wheel on your date with destiny.
Rise for our National Anthem.
- If a guy promises the 50-yard line...
- All right.
It's the Banner.
What so proudly we hailed...
You've been buying drinks all weekend for the State of Florida.
Log-rolling.
Yeah, I know.
Meet Senator Lackerby.
I don't know.
Just take a bow.
Not for me, for you.
- You don't understand.
- I understand plenty.
Come with me.
Excuse me.
Coming through.
Senator.
- Peter Burton.
Senator Stiles' office.
- Of course.
Welcome to Florida.
Thank you.
Meet a friend of mine.
Meet the man who put Sandy Wagstaff behind bars,
Deputy US Attorney, Tim Garrity.
Tim Garrity, Senator Lackerby.
Sandy Wagstaff stands for progress in this state.
I don't care what peccadilloes your witch-hunt has scared up, it is not justice when a Sandy Wagstaff goes to prison.
The Department of Justice, the FBI, Dade County prosecutors, a jury and some of your own staff would disagree with you.
If you have a problem, take it up with them.
I'm only here for the beer.
Excuse me.
Did you have to?
- Should I apologise?
- He's a senator.
He's a crook.
We could've indicted him and got orders not to.
You're right and we go back to the lousy seats.
- I'm kidding.
- It's hard to tell sometimes.
Will you look into something for me?
New Hampton Development.
It's similar to Wagstaff, bribes from federally-funded projects.
It's on authority.
I told a constituent I'd speak to you.
- What did she say?
- Her father's tests came back.
- An early stage of Alzheimer's.
- Oh, my God!
Jesus, I'm sorry.
Yeah.
Me, too.
- I never told you, OK?
- Yeah, yeah.
- He won't even tell his staff.
- How's Diana taking it?
You know, bad.
I mean, the girl never left home anyway.
- Now it'll get worse.
- Don't look at it like that.
Since we married, I've been living by this yardstick, James B Stiles.
- She married me.
- He's been nothing but good to you.
As long as I was a kid hustling floor votes or money for him.
It's different since I married his daughter.
It is.
It's nothing overt, but I feel it.
I'm not one of them.
You're crazy.
They don't think like that.
But, Tim, it's true.
It is.
A knock.
That's better.
Clean draft on the Armed Services report.
You're welcome.
Wait a minute.
Shut the door.
I'm going to be leaving in a couple of weeks.
Taking some time off.
I'm looking into running for a seat in the fourth CD.
- Tinker isn't vacating.
- I'm anticipating it.
- Is Stiles backing you?
- I'm just exploring things.
The point is, the senator's going to want me to realign the office staff, and I'm going to recommend against you taking over.
- I'm shocked.
- You think it's personal, but it isn't.
I think you're very good as an expediter.
Very valuable.
I'm not confident you'll focus on the real business of this office.
I'm sorry.
Don't be sorry, John.
I'll be OK.
Thanks for the tip.
Oh, yes!
- You hit the shit out of that ball.
- You'd better stick to politics.
OK.
Tinker's vacating a seat in the fourth district.
- I want to run.
- Seriously?
- I'd like to run with your support.
- Did you talk to Lawry?
- He's a manager, not a leader.
- He's got a terrific legislative mind.
- He deserves a chance to prove himself.
- Nobody'll vote for him.
I can do the job.
I need you on staff, especially with John leaving.
- I'd be more use to you in the House.
- Leave that to me.
- Next term, we'll set you an agenda.
- I've got an agenda, sir.
I want to run in the next election.
A couple of terms with you as my mentor, and I hope to fill your seat when you retire.
- Who said anything about retiring?
- Well...
I assumed with your illness...
Well, don't assume.
They've assured me the progression can take years.
That's great news!
Then, let's look at it long range.
An across-the-board ally in the House for your final term.
And, more importantly, someone to carry on your work.
I want to be that man, Senator.
What if I say no, Peter?
Then I have to seek support elsewhere.
Wouldn't that look strange?
Bringing his ammo into another camp.
People hear Alzheimer's, they worry.
- I don't want to think about that choice.
- Don't fuck with me!
I've been playing hardball since before you were born.
I don't mind playing hardball.
I do mind being taken for a fool.
- Does Diana know?
- She's knows I'm seeking your support.
Which is all I'm doing.
What's your hurry, Peter?
- Got a new cure for this country's ills?
- No, not like that.
Only issue I saw you catch fire over was where to eat with those Gucci-assed lobbyists you're so fond of.
So, what is it, boy?
The money sucks.
Food tastes the same.
You still get a year older every birthday.
The future, Senator.
I want to contribute.
I feel my time is now.
You do, huh?
I'm not going to stand in your way.
My last term's too important to me to take any chances with the election.
But let me tell you something.
You may win an election or two.
You may be able to live with yourself.
But God help you when the people find out.
They always do.
The time is now, John.
Tinker's not running for re-election.
The seat's open.
- Stiles'll back you?
- Yes.
You'll need funding.
Organisation.
More funding.
- It's a lot of orchestrating.
- What could I do to expedite things?
Give a couple of tugs.
Deadline for the Bridgeport project's coming up.
If we got that contract 'cause of you, my friends would be very impressed.
My friend at Justice has been looking into it, but he's coming up empty.
He's sharp.
He's not missing anything.
There's nothing there.
Yeah.
That's possible.
You knew there was nothing when you had me tip him.
You're letting your line slack.
Look out.
Give me that.
I wanted you in a position to help us.
How?
There's a Justice Department investigation.
Reveal that, New Hampton's out of the running.
It's a big favour.
- He's a friend.
I can't set him up.
- He'd never know.
What could happen?
A little hot water.
Isn't that worth it?
I can't do it.
- Come on.
- I got it.
Say I'm the Ghost of Christmas Future.
There you are.
Diana, kids, nice fire.
You're counting blessings.
What's making you runny inside?
Your achievements?
A card from what's-his-name?
"Warmest holiday wishes.
We must get together.
It's been too long."
I think I know the answer.
I just hope you do the right thing.
This is Sam Minot, New Haven Sentinel.
Is this Mr Garrity?
Yeah.
I'm doing a story on your investigation of the New Hampton Development.
- This is just a threshold investigation.
- It's an investigation, isn't it?
Well, yes, but...
Who are your sources?
- What's so funny?
- Oh, it's just a little ray of sunshine.
- What were you thinking of?
- He called my direct line.
I assumed he'd been cleared.
You're a US attorney!
You don't assume anything!
- No, sir.
- You were ambushed.
Any idea why?
No.
My tip-off was from an aide to Senator Stiles.
He's coming up empty, too.
- What's his name?
- Peter Burton.
He's my best friend.
Someone's got an agenda here, and we're going to find out who.
I'll have to offer you up.
I'm sorry, but you're suspended until further notice.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
- Hello, handsome.
- Hello, beautiful.
- Am I the first one here?
- You're the only one coming.
- What the?
- Peter wanted us duded up.
- Thought you wouldn't do it.
- He's right.
Where is he?
On the phone.
A drink?
- Scotch.
- No ice.
No ice.
The family crest.
- Are you all right?
- No.
- All my laundry's clean, though.
- They must know it's not your fault.
How long are they keeping you suspended?
Until they can pin it on somebody else.
- You look good.
- You look good, too.
What's the latest?
I was set up by New Hampton's rival.
- Like another developer?
- Yes.
What do you think?
I frisked Palmeri, if that's what you're thinking.
Diana's got a thing about him.
You think I'm sitting on my hands?
Of course I checked John.
- He had nothing to do with it.
- Justice will get to the bottom of it.
They may doze, but they never close.
Excuse me, I've got to check on the lamb.
We like it pink!
You can always hang around here for free grub.
Say yes.
Don't start.
The fact is you're out of work.
At least let me offer to help.
I'm announcing Monday.
Come down.
Let me give you the lay of the land.
Meet some people.
Tim, give me that much.
I'll come watch your announcement.
That's it.
We don't have to feed him now.
- What are we covering today?
- Burton, announcing for Congress.
Hope there's something to eat in there.
The senator's cutting it close.
I still think you ought to open with a fart joke.
- The senator is here.
- Mr Garrity.
Here, Mr Burton.
The senator's speech.
Senator.
There's only one sentence about Peter.
- I said I'd introduce him, that's all.
- What's going on?
- A misunderstanding.
- My ass!
- What good is this going to do?
- What is he talking about?
He said if I didn't back him, he'd leak my illness.
Not like that!
- Are you saying he's lying?
- Sit down!
He's got his version, I've got mine.
Side with your husband for once.
You wanted this, too.
Did you think it would just come to us?
I hate you!
Diana, get back in here!
I'm going out to introduce you, and then our deal is done.
And if you ever do anything to hurt my daughter, I'll destroy you.
- Gentlemen...
- We'll be right out.
Now what do I do?
They're expecting the beautiful wife!
- Hold on.
- I need a joke.
She's nervous...
Did you blackmail him?
I never threatened to use it.
It's me!
It's you.
But it's not a tyre!
- Don't start.
I did nothing to you.
- We got to go.
You were right.
Burton was the source of the leak of the investigation.
We think he set you up as a favour to John Palmeri.
His associates got a federal project by taking New Hampton out.
- Burton's had ties to him for years.
- He lives in one of Palmeri's houses.
We believe his campaign is being backed by Palmeri and his associates.
- You're assuming nothing?
- It's all backed up.
We've had an ongoing investigation into Palmeri.
He's tied into racketeering, bribery and fraud in two states.
- What now?
- Nothing.
We've nothing solid enough to go after Palmeri.
As for your pal Burton, fucking you over's not a federal offence.
- Let me go after him.
- What?
Let me work undercover on Burton's campaign.
I could gather evidence on Palmeri.
If Burton's breaking the law, we take it to Public Integrity.
You're not FBI, you're a trial lawyer.
You're not equipped.
He trusts me.
You have somebody's trust, you've all the equipment you need to nail them.
Let me make some calls.
- How you doing, Pete?
- Better now.
Thank you.
- I haven't done anything.
- Thanks for still having faith.
- Where's the Mean Machine?
- Media guy said it looked flaky.
How's this look?
Responsible.
- End of an era!
- Yeah.
When I hear about tax breaks for big corporations,
I think, "Why give them a break?"
But unless we attract new business to this district and expand our tax base, there won't be a new senior citizen centre, or meals-on-wheels for your housebound friends...
- John Palmeri?
- Yeah?
- Tim Garrity.
I'm with Peter.
- How'd you recognise me?
Pete described you.
And you're the only other person here who can walk.
- He looks good.
- Like a Kennedy.
86 the notes.
Get him to memorise.
I keep telling him to.
I wanted to go over strategy with you.
Sure.
Get in.
Now he's a candidate, everything goes through me.
Requests, advice, money.
Sounds good.
You ticklish?
- What?
- Some guys are.
Come on, let's go.
- He's cherry.
- What?
Careful is happy.
Didn't they teach you that at Justice?
I'm out of there.
I work for Peter now.
You never know what's bred in the bone.
Accept my apologies.
- Will you respect me in the morning?
- Speak to me.
It's a crime that people live like that.
I want to find the superintendent, the landlords.
I want some face-to-face now.
How would you do that?
- Can I steal him?
- Just a minute.
Just found out one of Palmeri's companies owns this property.
- What?
- Back off on your speech.
- What shall I say?
- Don't get specific.
"Tomorrow's looking good."
- How are you holding up?
- Fine.
Yeah?
You were pretty tight with Burton.
It's got to be rough.
My old man said that friendship is like the dew.
It settles on some roses and it settles on some dog shit.
Record by pressing the first button.
It's also your mike.
- There's a recorder in the shoulder.
- He has a scanner.
Fibre optics.
Doesn't register.
Bond.
James Bond.
When's your meeting with Palmeri?
- Tomorrow afternoon.
- Want to go over it again?
- Mr Palmeri.
- This way.
Let him lead, keep it specific, persuade, don't provoke, always be closing.
- Hey, Tim.
- How you doing?
Are you sure you haven't slipped anywhere?
Nobody knows a thing.
If it's about playing wifey at his debate, the answer's no.
- Is that final?
- Yes.
- OK.
- Damn it!
That's why you came here, isn't it?
Reconnaissance on his marriage.
That's really pathetic.
- I said I'd talk to you, that's all.
- You did your job, you can go.
No, you can go.
I'm going to stay and finish my drink.
I'm sorry.
- Want something?
- I'd love a double Stoly.
- Double Stoly...
- No, club soda with lime.
- What's that?
- A new trick I'm learning.
Helps me see things for how they are, instead of how I wish they were.
What do you see?
I see how Peter gets a hold on people.
He's so good at telling you what you want to hear.
How much we want to believe everything he says.
- It's very powerful.
- It's not just Peter, that's politicians.
Successful ones.
You can't condemn them.
It's the nature of the beast.
- Don't condemn him?
- He broke no law.
Any more than your father did by letting him do it.
It's a system that's worked for over 200 years, remember?
I think he had something to do with setting you up.
He had nothing to do with that.
What are you doing with him?
This isn't you, playing his game.
I am sorry you got hurt.
But just because he wasn't your goddamn perfect man doesn't mean I have to cut him off, too.
I am helping out an old friend, that is all.
- You don't understand.
- No, I don't understand.
You're right.
Diana, be there on election night.
Bring that bottle of champagne you bet him, 'cause I think he might win.
And bring a little faith in me.
You won't be disappointed.
Good evening and welcome back to Election '90 at Channel 3.
Did you hear that?
We got Bridgeport.
Hey, Pete, Channel 8.
This is Connecticut News Tonight with the Election '90 Special News.
Hey, Tom.
Yeah.
Well, 15 minutes.
So, we're not sure who's won...
In the US Senate race, with 53% of the precincts reporting in,
Channel 8 now projects that Senator James B Stiles has defeated challenger Stuart Hutchinson, returning Senator Stiles for a fourth term.
Turning back to the Congressional election...
Showtime!
In that close race for the fourth Congressional district, the Gold Coast, it's been between former assemblyman Kevin McQuade and Peter Burton.
We now project Peter Burton to be the winner by a narrow margin over Kevin McQuade.
Come here!
- Congratulations, Mrs Burton.
- Thank you.
Come here!
We fucking did it, man!
It's great!
Way to go, Pete!
Pardon me.
A bet's a bet.
Congratulations.
Listen, Diana, maybe we can sort things out.
No, Peter.
I've filed for a divorce.
McQuade's on the phone.
He's ready to concede.
In a minute.
Diana.
Go ahead.
You've been waiting for this moment your whole life.
Don't start getting regretful.
It's not your style.
Peter, come on.
This is it!
Kevin.
Thank you.
What was I supposed to have faith in?
Sometimes the system works and people are what you'd hoped.
I've lost the faith.
Did you know Peter set me up, or just suspect?
- What?
- Did Palmeri ask him?
Or did he just offer me up?
Oh, God.
You've known all along.
- Long enough to do something about it.
- Tonight?
The fat lady's warming up.
I'll see you down there.
Peter's accepting in about 20 minutes.
We'll see you in the ballroom.
- Everybody out.
Give him some air.
- As your new Congressman,
I propose you all go downstairs and get a drink.
See you later.
- See you down there.
- All right.
Seven years, my friend.
- Bet settled.
- Unbelievable.
This stuff's a lot more expensive than it was in 1983, I'll tell you that.
We may not always get what we want or what we need, just so's we don't get what we deserve.
- Congratulations, Congressman.
- Thanks, brother.
No, no.
Hey, I appreciate it, really.
All right.
Give me 15 minutes.
- Where the hell's Palmeri?
- I thought he'd watch his horse come in.
He's going away.
Maybe he's choosing which 100 suits to take.
Shoes to match.
What does he do at his construction sites?
- Do they vacuum before he arrives?
- That's if he ever arrives.
Some piece of work.
- Please!
You don't know the half of it.
- How much do you know?
More than you.
He's got a hammer-lock on a few union locals.
You don't run a carting company without John as partner.
His wife's got a "catering service" with half the state's hospitals.
- Bitch wouldn't know Jell-O from steak.
- How do you do it?
I'd be nervous.
- We got an arrangement.
- Go along, get along?
- He knows the parameters.
- What if he changes them?
It won't happen.
I'm not a puny local official taking envelopes.
- What do you mean?
- I'll tell you a story.
Town supervisor,
I forgot where, reneges on a variance for one of John's developments.
Comes home one night, found his house burnt down.
Didn't even let the dog out.
Come on, let's drink up.
I got a lot of people to thank.
How did he get so much money into the campaign?
Holding companies, brothers-in-law, friends.
Man's got a lot of friends.
And you owe them all?
Yeah, I owe them all.
Now I'm elected, I'll take care of them.
My time, my way.
Just leave the dog with a neighbour.
What do you owe them right now?
- What is this?
- What's what?
All these questions about Palmeri?
What's with you not looking me in the eye?
Palmeri's being arraigned right now.
They're gonna nail you for accepting illegal kickbacks, conspiracy and obstruction of justice.
You son of a bitch!
You set me up at Justice.
Why did you do that to me?
That's a lie.
I'll deny we ever had this conversation.
Yes, we did.
Say "cheese".
Fuck you!
Come on, tell me about justice!
Tell me it has nothing to do with me getting Diana.
Tell me this isn't about me coming out ahead of you.
Get up, you self-righteous son of a...
It's easy for you to screw people.
If everyone's out for you, then it's OK.
Garrity!
FBI!
Get out!
I'm sorry for what I did to you.
- I had no choice.
- Course you did.
I got instinct and some moves.
Choice is for guys like you.
Diana married you.
You chose to make her regret it with everything that you had.
Stiles took you under his wing and you chose to blackmail him.
I was your friend and you chose to betray me.
You did this to yourself.
Why?
I needed more than you could give, you or Diana or any one person.
They say great men are embraced by thousands of strangers.
I want to be great.
So you sacrificed a few to reach the many.
They believe in me down there.
And you can't take that away.
They won't let you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You know, for the past couple of months, I've been saying tomorrow's looking good.
I'll tell you a secret, tonight's feeling great.
First of all, I want to thank my campaign family.
Because of your fantastic dedication and energy, we're here tonight.
With your hopes and dreams in our hearts, we're going to Washington.
In the past few months, as I've met the fine people of this district,
I've come to think of you not just as voters, but as family, as friends.
And that's how I want you to think of me.
As your friend in Washington, as your brother in Congress.
I'm listening, and what's more, I hear you.
One of the questions
I've been asked, over and over again during the campaign is, "Peter Burton,
"why should I trust you?
"Why should I believe in you?"
It's a tough question.
The tough answer is because I'm not afraid to admit that I'm human.
I'm one of you.
I'm motivated, I'm proud,
I'm competitive and, yeah, sometimes I'm a little headstrong.
- Does that sound familiar?
- Yes!
I'm one of you.
And I'll tell you something.
Where there's an "Us" there's a "Them".
In smoky back rooms, here in our district, they're trading on our tomorrows for their own gain.
In the past few months one of these men invited me in,
and I let him think I was for sale.
Not Peter Burton!
As you'll soon find out,
I was so good at it that some lawyers from Washington really thought I was for sale.
That's the case they'll try to make.
I put it to you, was I too motivated?
Is it possible?
Too headstrong?
Perhaps.
Less than circumspect?
Definitely.
But I did what any one of you would've done.
Tell it to the people who can't find a home.
Tell it to the people who can't find a decent job, who can't send their children to decent schools.
I did what you would've done.
I saw an opportunity to get a jump on these guys, and I seized it.
I took that risk for one reason.
I took that risk for you.
We love you, Peter!
In the hopes that one day I would be here with you at my side, to take back our tomorrows from these crooks and these schemers, and to send a message to Washington that we're in charge and tomorrow's looking good!
Garrity's on his way down.
Here he comes.
A damn good job.
- Ready?
- He's in his suite.
Let him call his lawyer, then bring him down the back way.
- Good work.
- Get enough?
- Plenty.
- Good.
That's good.
- You OK?
- Fine.
Wish he'd lost.
Spare him humiliation on the front page.
Win or lose, he's front page.
If not you, it would've been somebody else.
But it is me.
He was my best friend and I used that to fuck him.
Just like he did to you.
You're even.
You signed on to Justice all full of fire to set things right.
And you're good.
But until tonight, it never cost you.
You don't own it until it costs you.
They're bringing him down.
If I lost, I'd bring you a case of champagne.
Well, I got elected, but doesn't look like I'm going to get sworn in.
So, there's the champagne.
Bet settled.
I'm sorry it ended up like this.
- I second that.
- What are you going to do?
They offered me immunity if I testify against Palmeri.
Nobody said anything about immunity from Palmeri.
Or I can take my chances.
I heard you took yourself off the case.
Thanks.
- No deal and I'll have to testify.
- I know.
- I've got to get going.
- Yeah.
But save a bottle of that champagne.
We'll make it an ongoing bet.
You know the old saying in Washington.
Only two things can truly wreck a man's political career:
Getting caught with a live boy or a dead girl.
- Good luck, Pete.
- See you around campus, man.
Good eveníng and welcome back to Election '90 at Channel 3.
The polls have just closed ín Connectícut...
Drinks coming through.
Stop it!
- We got it!
- We got Bridgeport!
Did you hear that?
We got Bridgeport. I knew it.
Hey, Pete, Channel 8.
Thís ís Connecticut News Tonight wíth the Election '90 Special News.
Telephone.
Telephone, Tim.
Thank you.
Hello.
Yeah, Tom.
Yeah. I hope so.
About 15 minutes or so.
Wíth 530/o of the precíncts reportíng ín,
Channel 8 now projects that three-tíme íncumbent Senator James B Stíles has defeated Stuart Hutchínson, gívíng Senator Stíles a fourth term.
In that close race for the fourth Congressíonal dístríct, the Gold Coast, both our exít polls and the precíncts already reportíng ín...
Shomime!
Peter.
Peter Tomorrow's-lookíng-good Burton, a man I loved, the kínd wíthout the mousetraps of sex and marríage, spared the contortíons that famíIíes requíre.
The love men can have for one another, love wíthout need, struck ín acquaíntance, buíIt on fríendshíp, and fulfílled ín joy at the other's accomplíshment.
We have projectíons ín the races for the síxth and fourth dístrícts...
God, íf only ít were that símple.
All yours.
Thank you.
- What?
!
- Shit!
- Damn it!
- That's it!
What the hell do you think you're doing?
Witness!
Witness!
Witness!
Negligent!
- Sory.
- Sory doesn't make her chery again.
- Are you blind?
- You pulled into my spot.
It's just a dent.
It's not a big fucking deal!
It's just a dent?
Maybe on your car, farmer, but on mine...
Nobody solved problems with violence.
That's what's wrong with the world.
Come on, break it up!
Stop it, this is so macho!
Hey, how are you doing?
I'm...
- Get out of my room!
- Your room?
- This is my room!
- This is my room!
42, I'm afraid so.
- l don't believe this.
- Jesus!
OK, look, what if I apologise, OK?
You're right, it was my fault. I'm sory.
Really, OK?
No hard feelings.
Why fight if it was your fault?
First impressions are important.
I slink out of my car and say,
"Here I am, folks.
Say hi to a total asshole"?
No. I stand up for myself.
- l create doubt as to whose fault it was.
- That's what you were doing?
I got the dented car, not you.
It's no skin off your nose.
- Eveybody makes out, right?
- Wrong.
First law school, then you become a sleazebag with no regard for the truth.
- l've met guys like you before.
- Yeah?
You got that face, got that smile, got that corduroy suit that comes with elbow patches.
You got one of those suits?
So what?
Just curious.
- Which is 42?
- Over there.
Tim!
Garrity, come on.
You can run but you can't hide.
Stubblefield?
You dog, I heard an ugly rumour you were going to be here.
Tim Garrity, you'll never amount to anything.
- Your mother and I are disappointed.
- You'll have to ty harder, that's all.
- How you doing?
- Great.
You?
- BJ said there was a fight.
See it?
- No...
Yeah, a guy got what was coming to him and will live in shame for ever.
- l'm sory i missed it...
- Sory, Doug Stubblefield, Peter Burton.
Good to know you. I got a keg on ice, you won't believe who's here, so let's go.
I'll be there.
- Anyone you want to ask?
- Girls?
The place is crawling with them.
If you want, I can go and see about changing rooms.
I'd understand.
I got a colour N and subscriptions to Tíme and Natíonal Geographíc.
Three credit cards and a guy at Hialeah phones me sure things.
- l'm Tim Garrity.
- Peter Burton.
- Want to come to Stubblefield's?
- No, don't want to butt in.
Come on.
He's a jerk, all right, so consider it punishment.
- Come on.
- OK.
- Where are you from?
- Providence, Rhode Island.
You?
All over.
We moved around a lot.
- College?
- Georgetown.
You?
UConn.
lgnorantía jurís non excusat.
"lgnorance of the law is no excuse." Robinson versus Virginia.
All right, ladies and gentlemen, who can give me the facts of the case?
Mr Burton.
Proximate cause.
Train conductor pushes a passenger.
Guy's carying firecrackers.
Falls to the ground.
Exploding, injuring bystander.
Foreseeability?
The railroad company couldn't foresee the box containing fireworks or that their employee's actions could cause injuy.
The reasonable man's standard?
Foreseeability and proximate cause make for a reasonable man?
We may not always get what we want or what we need, just so's we don't get what we deserve.
- So her parents were down the hall?
- We're not fucking in the living room!
I wouldn't imply anything as base and vulgar as that.
Let me get this straight.
It's breakfast.
You're sitting with Senator and Mrs Stiles.
The happy millionaires eat breakfast, Diana's there, apple of Dad's eyes...
Stamford.
He pulls those telegenic blue eyes on you and says what?
- Good morning.
- You're missing something.
- What do you do at a girlfriend's?
- They're not senators' daughters.
- Where are you going?
- London, in fact.
My parents are in Geneva.
Some World Bank thing.
Christmas in London?
Plum pudding and Marley's ghost.
It's mostly Arabs and rain. I'm flying into New York.
Want to get together?
The Stiles throw this famous New Year's Eve party.
I want you to meet Diana.
Here, let me give you the number.
Nobody has a pen in this situation.
What a guy!
- Hey, don't forget your stuff.
- Mery Christmas!
Three turkey white.
Two turtle doves...
And a partrídge ín a pear tree
1 7.84.
- You really got to go?
- l still got some presents to buy.
Believe it or not.
Talk about last minute.
Plus, I promised my sister-in-law I'd make the desserts.
I'd ask you to come, but it's lust family.
Sory.
I hate to see someone alone on Christmas Eve.
- Will you be OK?
- l'll be fine.
Mery Christmas.
And they síng of Chrístmas.
Bah, humbug!
Míght as well close shop for the níght.
We'll fínísh tomorrow.
But, sír, tomorrow ís Chrístmas Day.
- Tim!
Pete.
- Hey, how are you doíng?
- Good.
How are you?
- How was London?
- Great.
It snowed and eveything.
- So, where are you now?
New York City. I've got to visit my aunt and uncle in Hartford tomorrow.
I was wondering if I could stop in and say hi.
Come up here New Year's Eve.
I checked, it's fine.
Got a tux?
- Sure, no problem.
- AII ríght.
Let me gíve you dírectíons.
- Take the Tríborough Brídge...
- Hold on, let me get a pen.
- OK, go.
- New England freeway to exít four...
- All right, tomorrow afternoon?
- See you tomorrow.
You the owner?
- You want a tux at 9 a.m.?
- Why would I call you at home?
- Cash or credit card?
- Big cash.
- Thanks a lot.
- OK, come on in.
Hey, stop that.
- l'm starving.
- We need champagne.
Diana, can you get your father?
- Have you seen my father?
- No.
- Diana, Happy New Year!
- Happy New Year!
- Excuse me.
Where's Daddy?
- In there, wrestling with Burt Tuck.
- ...not the doctors...
- Burt, you're wrong.
You're full of shit.
The AMA has got to realise people don't give a rat's ass about that, when a simple appendectomy costs $6,OOO.
Where does it say Congress answers to the AMA and not to their electorate?
- l'm sory i interrupted.
- It's all right.
Go on.
People don't want AMA deciding on health any more than E_on running the Interior Department.
You ever been on an AMA golf outing, son?
- No, Senator.
- Well, take Dr Tuck here.
He'll fix your bursitis, sharpen up your short game, wipe out your campaign debt before you're off the first green.
Yes, Senator.
You're right.
You're there to represent the people who elected you.
But to do that you've got to get elected, and that takes money.
So, evey day you ty to remember where you drew the line.
- What's your name?
- Peter Burton. I'm at UVA with Tim.
- Nice to meet you, Peter.
- It's an honour.
Now that you've given me indigestion, Burt, let's eat.
Finally!
I'm starving.
You did fine. I'm John Lawy.
I'm an aide to the senator.
Peter Burton. I was lust reading your profile in the Washíngtonían.
- Just?
- Just recently.
The article was in a year and a half ago.
Some stack in the libray.
You prepare for eveything the way you prepare for parties?
John, let's get something to eat.
Could you pass these around?
Peter!
A special hat for you.
Looks good.
- Bathroom's there.
- Just wanted to get out of the crowd.
Have you seen Tim?
Deep into it with some guy from Justice.
That's not "some guy".
That's the Deputy Attorney General.
It's like the Natíonal Revíew come to life in there.
And are you impressed by that?
Yes, I am.
- How was London?
- Oh, great.
Fantastic.
- You went to school there?
- l've still got lots of friends there.
Shuttle them in for the party?
- You don't remind me of James Dean.
- What?
You remind Tim of James Dean.
If James Dean was a graduate grind.
Tim likes to make the basically boring glamorous.
No offence.
- None taken.
- There you are.
Give me the last kiss of '83.
I haven't seen that much log-rolling since my father's poker games.
What's log-rolling?
Compromising the duties of office under the guise of expediency.
Government by cheques and cocMails.
- A system that's worked for 200 years.
- l said nothing about your dad.
- Don't start.
- One mínute to got
- Resolutions?
- Find a good margarita in Georgetown.
- Cop out!
- You?
- Too young and powerless to mention.
- OK, next decade?
Prosecuting half the guest list.
To be in Congress within 1 O years.
- That's it?
- But I mean it.
- Is this expensive?
- About $80.
I'll make a bet with you.
Election night '90.
If I win, you each owe me a bottle, by hand.
- If not?
- l'll bring you a case.
Just send mine. I won't want to be around you the day after you lost.
Happy New Year!
Happy New Year, Pete.
Happy New Year!
My turn, Tim.
- What's wrong with this party?
- Who told you about it?
I smoked a ioint with the caterer.
It's drug-induced?
Can we drive around for hours looking for a diner?
Usher in the New Year with adults and you'll become one.
- Where is this joint?
- Over by Bridgeport.
- Here we are.
- This looks shitty.
- Let's go to Greenwich.
- It's worse.
- One drink.
- We won't stay long, I promise.
They've written "Party" three times on the marquee.
How bad can it be?
- They've clearly pulled out all the stops.
- OK, OK!
Two draughts, two shooters of Jack and a Baileys.
- Jack?
- Yeah.
Browns for my friend.
No, Browns for my friend.
Petey Bertkowski?
Is that Petey Bertkowski?
Jesus!
Out of my way!
Coming through!
Out of my way!
Bertkowski!
Petey Bertkowski!
Jesus!
Todd!
- Short hair!
It's been a long time.
- Yeah, a long time.
I saw your dad. I work for the city and he worked with us.
A big snowstorm before Thanksgiving.
- We're just leaving.
- Seen Janine?
- l know she'll want to talk to you.
- Say hi to her...
Baby!
Janíne, honey!
Baby!
Janíne!
Come on!
We're married now.
We got two kids and it's good.
Hey, Peter.
Hey, Janine.
You look good.
You, too.
Different.
Happy New Year.
It's good seeing you guys.
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.
Happy New Year.
Let's belly up here.
Couple of beers!
- Just don't judge me, OK?
- l don't even know your name.
Peter Michael Bertkowski.
Born, New Haven, March 9 1959, to Mike and Irene.
The mother left when he was ten.
The father, a Cutty Sark fan, raised the boy, working sporadically around the holidays.
People got the charitable urge.
Where were you Christmas?
School.
- Why did you lie to me?
- l thought you wouldn't be my friend.
Why would you think that I'd give a shit about stuff like that?
Most people don't see the world with the same eyes you do.
They're not so sure who they are, not so happy with who they are.
You don't have to lie to me.
- You don't understand, man.
- Why don't you let me ty?
I'm sory, Tim.
The thing is, these personal traits of your father's, some you can't stand, these come out in you.
There's nothing you can do, any more than you can about getting his ears or his hairline...
You know, last weekend, right.
Diana, little thing.
Dinner before the movie.
Turns into a fight, no other reason than me sticking to a goddamn plan.
My father exactly.
How?
He ran his house the same way he runs his courtroom:
confusing stubbornness with strength.
I knew what she meant.
Got even madder denying it.
Do you have any idea what I'm talking about?
But you don't have to become your old man.
It's not inevitable.
Not if you fight it with eveything you got.
- Hey, Tim.
Timmy!
- Yeah?
- Mine came!
- You got it!
All right.
OK, on three.
Good luck!
One, two, three!
- OK. "Department of Justice..." - "After a considerable number..."
- "inform you of your acceptance..."!
- "...staff of Senator James B Stiles"!
Washington!
Yes.
Look around.
Here we are.
A lady writes, "Dear Senator, My Oscar is a great admirer of yours,
"and evey time you come on the N he sits in front to watch.
"And when they applaud your speech he barks right along."
Oscar's her fucking dog!
Now, "Oscar has been sick.
"Could the senator find time to have a photograph taken with him?
"lt would mean so much, you know."
Don't eveybody look at once.
Senator Frank Steubens with an unidentified blonde.
Laminated.
Jesus!
- Jesus!
- She's a lobbyist.
America's family man toasted with a blonde at Wah Fong's.
I like the papers on the table.
Nice touch.
Working dinner.
They're drawing up a proposal introducing his member into her historic chamber.
- You wished you'd said it.
- All right.
I wish Stiles was here.
We got a bill Steubens' committee's been blocking.
I'd love to see the senator march over and lobby him with Blondie sitting there.
Why don't you do it?
You're the real brains in Stiles's office.
We know it, but Steubens doesn't yet.
- Take a vacation!
- Drink your drink!
Get him out of here.
Taxi !
We're going to Ronnie and Nancy's.
Want to come?
- Bye.
- Goodnight.
Kentucm plates.
Russell Building parking sticker.
Steubens' car.
Wow!
Now I've seen it all.
Can we go now?
- Get the jack out of the trunk.
- What for?
Peter, what the fuck are you doing?
Oh, no!
Yeah, they got me, too.
Senator Steubens?
Tim, it's Senator Steubens.
Senator, I'm a great, great admirer of yours.
Oh, vey nice to meet you, sir.
Miss Winston.
- Peter.
- Hi.
Must be a Democratic precinct.
Let me change your tyre.
Oh, no, I couldn't ask you to do that.
- Just take my car.
- l couldn't.
I'm an aide to Senator Stiles.
Stiles?
Good people, Stiles.
Good people.
I could just run up to your office tomorrow, exchange keys.
It would be an honour, Senator.
- l don't know...
- Let's accept.
You think so, honey?
OK.
Thank you.
Just let me have a word with our good friend here.
Hold that, honey.
- Nice meeting you.
- You, too.
- Peter Burton, Senator.
- Just call me Frank, Pete.
- l know what this looks like.
- Like a senator working late.
I know what it looks like.
Don't yank my chain.
- No, Frank.
- Just between us men.
- Can't stress the importance.
- No need, Frank.
Thank you.
Pete.
Thank you again.
Come on, honey.
Senator.
- Thank you.
- Goodnight.
Frank, hury.
- The moves on this kid!
- You stuck his tyre.
That's a crime.
OK, so I created a situation.
So what?
I did him a favour, equals Stiles did him a favour.
So he's on our dance card in a close vote.
What's wrong?
It's wrong.
You think the Department of Justice never cuts corners?
It's a new day.
- What the fuck does that mean?
- Don't get caught.
Lighten up.
I didn't break into Watergate.
I let the air out of a tyre.
It's kids' stuff.
Baker's moving to excuse Standish, so we've got to get into his involvement with the pipeline contracts.
Hammer Standish when he twists his watch.
What?
Evey time he takes the Fifth or "can't recall", he twists it.
Like those Lebanese lobbying answers.
He twists his watch, come down hard.
Hey, Pete.
- Your boss is writing "kick me" on this.
- Afternoon, Frank.
- You know Peter?
- Met last night.
We had a nice chat about your amendment to the Appropriations Bill.
Listen, Jim.
Walk back with me after the hearing. I think we can talk.
See you inside.
Yeah.
- Will you tell me what that was about?
- No time.
We'd better get inside.
I told Mrs Santana we'd be out of the apartment Monday morning.
- Did she rent it?
- l don't know.
Why?
I'm staying, Tim.
I'm not going back to school.
- You're kidding?
- No.
We're in the best school there is.
College of Ways and Means, DC.
- Let's go.
- Let's do it.
- Take 'em.
- Good shot!
- Are you sure it's OK?
- Yes, I was nodding off, too.
Dinner's not for an hour, so we can walk...
Or lust get a bite.
No, I'm not hungy!
- l'm getting fat anyway.
- You are not!
- Maybe if we walked I'd be hungy.
- It's OK.
I'm sory.
You put this big night together and I'm being a creep.
- What's the matter?
- We're about to be separated again.
And I'm thinking maybe that's not such a bad thing.
- What?
- l don't know where it's going.
It's going fine.
What is this?
Just because you say it's fine, doesn't make it fine.
OK.
OK.
I'm listening.
Well...
Why are you so set on Justice?
Isn't there another track?
- Why be out of the loop?
- Ass-kiss your way to the middle?
That's not what it is.
My parents have a wonderful life in it.
- You're one of the best.
- You think the DOJ is for rejects?
No, I'm not saying that.
I don't want to spend my life tying to get votes.
If you're happy with your programme, fine.
But it's not mine, or ours.
I can't say I'd be happy being basically a cop's wife.
Not a cop, an attorney.
No one said anything about marriage.
I hate the way I sound, but I have to say these things.
We have to think about them.
So, I'll call you when I'm in town next.
I didn't mean to hurt you. I love you.
Let's get out of here.
I'm going to the bathroom.
Wait for me, OK?
Yeah.
- l knew it was no before I could ask.
- Did she give you a reason?
My career plans aren't glamorous enough.
It seems like that matters.
- What will you do?
- Ty and fall out of love with her.
She loves you.
It's obvious.
If she loses you over some agenda, then she doesn't deserve you.
- Am I right?
- Peter.
- Could I speak with you?
- Certainly, John.
- Hi, Tim.
- Hi.
- What's up?
- l just came from Steubens' office.
- Is he behaving himself?
- Maybe you want to talk in private.
Tim's my brother.
He's going to hear it anyway.
Here it is.
Don't you ever, ever go tying to make some deal for the senator's office.
You want to play maverick, take it somewhere else.
If you're staying, you go through channels.
Got me?
- Got you.
- Good.
The campaign staff in Connecticut is spread too thin.
We need a hand.
Take the shuttle to New York, then the train to New Haven.
- Someone will pick you up.
- Decoration committee?
- Fundamentals.
Something you missed.
- Ask you one thing?
- Quickly.
- Is Steubens with the amendment?
- That's not the point.
- l know.
I don't think you do.
Yes.
He's fucking with me.
It's personal.
Now I have to find a way round him.
Shouldn't be too hard.
40 years old and he's still an aide.
Dresses like a leftover campus radical.
John Denver-looking motherf...
Thank you.
Thank you vey much.
Lyndon Johnson once told me that a good speech is measured by how quickly it gets the audience on its feet.
So, the owner of the black Mercedes with Connecticut plates, your lights are on.
Sory about that.
Not staying for the rest of the speech?
No. I just wanted to see how my joke went over.
Been here since eight in the morning.
Goodnight.
Where are you going?
I'm going to sneak over that fence, take off my clothes and float in that pool.
I'd ask you, but I hate hearing no.
How do you know I'd say no?
'Cause I don't think those looks you've been dealing me add up to you actually doing anything.
I think you're a daddy's girl.
And she doesn't fool around with the help.
- Got me all figured out, huh?
- Tell me I'm wrong.
You're wrong.
- What about Tim?
- What about Tim?
- What are we going to tell him?
- Nothing.
We were both curious.
You've been in my bed evey night this week.
That's more than curious.
This doesn't have anything to do with Tim.
You going back with him?
Peter, I love Tim.
Whether or not I can be with him, I don't know.
Whatever happens, you're not part of it.
You don't want to be.
You're his best friend.
What if you're what I want?
- What if I fall in love with you?
- God, no.
No, no, no.
- This is screwed up enough as it is.
- l could.
You could fall in love with me, too.
- Stop it. I don't think so.
- Why?
I'm not good enough?
- Come on, Peter.
- Just say that you could love me.
- No.
- Just say it.
Just say it.
No!
They pay peanuts with 2 weeks a year?
- l just started.
It gets better.
- l know waiters with better deals.
- Who'd you say your friend was?
- John Palmeri.
A developer.
Took a big initiative for Stiles last election.
A big initiative?
- A lot of cash and kicked labour butt.
- Did you let him borrow your car?
That's vey funny.
He needed the senator's ear, I was able to help and here we are.
I'm not an intern any more. I got my own relationship with the senator.
Chief Administrative Aide.
Thank you.
- You're right on schedule, aren't you?
- First vacation in two years.
- l'll beat you skiing, too.
- l don't ski on the bunny slopes.
- Think I need a lesson?
- Three or four.
You don't have to decide now.
- If you get tired slogging...
- Slogging?
Turtling...
I got you a slot with Stiles.
Me and you together.
- Me under you?
- No, I show you the ropes.
In a week, you'll be writing laws, not looking them up.
- Enforcing them.
- Ty it.
- Why do you want me there?
- For the future.
For when I make the run.
I don't kid myself.
I'm Mr Shine.
Give me a baby to kiss and a filmmaker to shoot it, I'll be in.
- l'll need my legal eagle.
- l like what I do.
Somebody hurts someone, steals from them, I can right it.
- That's vey liberating.
- Why are you so naive?
- Your Washington is not mine.
- You're wrong, man.
It's all the same ball game.
Even at Justice.
You need to realise that.
If you're that good, you'll have plenty of men to pick from.
If I can ever help from where l am, all you've got to do is ask.
All right?
- Last run.
- Damn, did we do this week up!
Yeah, we did.
God, look at that.
Listen, Tim, I've got to talk to you about something.
About seeing somebody.
I haven't been straight.
I haven't...
Diana. I've been with Diana.
After you went back to school, I was around her, around the campaign.
- It's been on and off for a year.
- And now?
- l'm going to ask her to mary me.
- That's your relationship with Stiles?
- Don't think that.
- What am I supposed to think?
It lust happened.
I'm taking this.
If you want an easier run, I'll meet you at the bottom.
- Last run.
We've got to ski it together.
- It's up to you.
Follow if you want.
Shit!
Pete, stop!
No!
Stop!
Just fall over!
Ski patrol!
Ski patrol!
- Don't move.
- My fucking leg!
Ski patrol's on its way.
I didn't hear you soon enough.
I know you were yelling.
- l'm sory.
- l couldn't hear. I know you were there.
I know you meant to warn me.
- l know you were tying to help.
- l'm sory.
Ski patrol!
You know with Diana i never meant to hurt you.
You know that?
- Right?
- Yes.
Ski patrol!
Oh, fuck!
Don't move.
Be my best man.
- Good?
- Yes.
So I was absolved of tryíng to kíII my best fríend.
And he was acquítted of snakíng the only gírl that really mattered to me.
Even fro_en and ín shock, one leg mangled and mo ríbs cracked,
Peter Burton could cut hímself a deal.
Louise, that's crazy.
We could hold fundraisers forever.
It wouldn't make up for that kind of cut.
Don't do this!
You pull out on this vote and I'm screwed!
- Hold on.
Diana.
- One minute.
Could you hold on?
- Warrilow's told Peckheiser to vote no.
- Dick's cutting Meals for Millions.
- Do I care?
- David!
Louise, hi, Peter.
And to you.
Don't tell me he feels terrible.
He's going to look terrible if Diana's forced to fight him.
- OK.
Louise.
- David.
Yes, isn't he?
I'm back in a week.
Hold him until then.
I'll get my father involved and we'll figure it out.
You're a saint.
Great.
Love to the kids.
Bye.
Yes!
And this must be Palmeri Bay.
Officially it's still Long Island Sound, but we're working on it!
- What do you think?
- It's beautiful.
I'm glad you like it.
It's yours.
- That was easy.
Let's look at Porsches.
- l'm serious.
I know you're going to love it here.
Especially you, Diana.
- Thank you, but...
- But nothing.
I'm looking forward at a man who's going to be my Congressman.
He needs to establish residency in this district.
- l couldn't afford this place.
- Your campaign fund can.
- What campaign fund?
- The exploratoy money I'm raising.
A portion will be allocated for housing and office space.
This is it.
- Too good to be true?
- There's nothing unethical about it.
If that's what you're worried about.
This is done a lot.
- l didn't know that.
- You live, you learn.
- Diana, I want to show you the rest.
- Sure.
This is the master bedroom.
Most rooms face the water... lf you're not comfortable with it, just hand those keys back.
The important thing is I want to help you, work with you.
- Any time you're uncomfortable, say no.
- Any time, on anything?
Absolutely.
We're bidding for a federally-funded Iow-income project for Bridgeport.
It's a fair bid and we want the job, but we've got competition.
- You said you've a friend at Justice.
- A good buddy.
- l don't trust him.
- That's prejudice.
No, instinct.
- If his name was Winthrop...
- That's prejudice!
- He's a respected businessman.
- He's a silk suit with tax scams.
You don't trust him because he fought to get where he is.
- He sees something in me.
- So do I, Peter. I married you.
Quit tying to tear me down. I'm just tying to get us where we want to be.
- Unbelievable.
- Congratulations.
- Take care.
Bye.
- See you later.
- Are others as guilty as Wagstaff?
- Did you think they'd convict?
Are you satisfied Wagstaff's as high as it went?
I can't answer questions because of the appeal. I have a statement.
Wagstaff's conviction is not only proof that the system works, but that it can work across the board.
No matter how high up, you're still accountable.
I thank the juy, local prosecutors and eveyone who came forward.
I've a message to the Orlando Sentínel._ Garrity, two Rs and a Y.
- What are you doing here?
- Taking Dick Tracy to the Super Bowl.
- 623.
We're here on the left.
- This is great!
- He promised me the 50-yard line.
- Where'd you get the tickets?
Business Round Table.
The NRA's got a sm-box.
Maybe we can hang around there the second half.
Why are you wasting the Super Bowl on a lowly DOJ attorney?
Maybe I did waste them.
Fuck you. I never see you now.
I'm sory.
It's this weekend.
Eveybody's brown-nosing.
I feel like the third wheel on your date with destiny.
Ríse for our Natíonal Anthem.
- If a guy promises the 50-yard line...
- All right.
It's the Banner.
What so proudly we haíled...
You've been buying drinks all weekend for the State of Florida.
Log-rolling.
Yeah, I know.
Meet Senator Lackerby.
I don't know.
Just take a bow.
Not for me, for you.
- You don't understand.
- l understand plenty.
Come with me.
Excuse me.
Coming through.
Senator.
- Peter Burton.
Senator Stiles' office.
- Of course.
Welcome to Florida.
Thank you.
Meet a friend of mine.
Meet the man who put Sandy Wagstaff behind bars,
Deputy US Attorney, Tim Garrity.
Tim Garrity, Senator Lackerby.
Sandy Wagstaff stands for progress in this state.
I don't care what peccadilloes your witch-hunt has scared up, it is not justice when a Sandy Wagstaff goes to prison.
The Department of Justice, the fbi, Dade County prosecutors, a juy and some of your own staff would disagree with you.
If you have a problem, take it up with them. I'm only here for the beer.
Excuse me.
Did you have to?
- Should I apologise?
- He's a senator.
He's a crook.
We could've indicted him and got orders not to.
You're right and we go back to the lousy seats.
- l'm kidding.
- It's hard to tell sometimes.
Will you look into something for me?
New Hampton Development.
It's similar to Wagstaff, bribes from federally-funded projects.
It's on authority.
I told a constituent I'd speak to you.
- What did she say?
- Her father's tests came back.
- An early stage of Alzheimer's.
- Oh, my God!
Jesus, I'm sory.
Yeah.
Me, too.
- l never told you, OK?
- Yeah, yeah.
- He won't even tell his staff.
- How's Diana taking it?
You know, bad.
I mean, the girl never left home anyway.
- Now it'll get worse.
- Don't look at it like that.
Since we married, I've been living by this yardstick, James B Stiles.
- She married me.
- He's been nothing but good to you.
As long as I was a kid hustling floor votes or money for him.
It's different since I married his daughter.
It is.
It's nothing overt, but I feel it.
I'm not one of them.
You're crazy.
They don't think like that.
But, Tim, it's true.
It is.
A knock.
That's better.
Clean draft on the Armed Services report.
You're welcome.
Wait a minute.
Shut the door.
I'm going to be leaving in a couple of weeks.
Taking some time off.
I'm looking into running for a seat in the fourth CD.
- Tinker isn't vacating.
- l'm anticipating it.
- Is Stiles backing you?
- l'm just exploring things.
The point is, the senator's going to want me to realign the office staff, and I'm going to recommend against you taking over.
- l'm shocked.
- You think it's personal, but it isn't.
I think you're vey good as an expediter.
Vey valuable.
I'm not confident you'll focus on the real business of this office. I'm sory.
Don't be sory, John. I'll be OK.
Thanks for the tip.
Oh, yes!
- You hit the shit out of that ball.
- You'd better stick to politics.
OK.
Tinker's vacating a seat in the fourth district.
- l want to run.
- Seriously?
- l'd like to run with your support.
- Did you talk to Lawy?
- He's a manager, not a leader.
- He's got a terrific legislative mind.
- He deserves a chance to prove himself.
- Nobody'll vote for him.
I can do the lob.
I need you on staff, especially with John leaving.
- l'd be more use to you in the House.
- Leave that to me.
- Next term, we'll set you an agenda.
- l've got an agenda, sir.
I want to run in the next election.
A couple of terms with you as my mentor, and I hope to fill your seat when you retire.
- Who said anything about retiring?
- Well... I assumed with your illness...
Well, don't assume.
They've assured me the progression can take years.
That's great news!
Then, let's look at it long range.
An across-the-board ally in the House for your final term.
And, more importantly, someone to cary on your work.
I want to be that man, Senator.
What if I say no, Peter?
Then I have to seek support elsewhere.
Wouldn't that look strange?
Bringing his ammo into another camp.
People hear Alzheimer's, they wory.
- l don't want to think about that choice.
- Don't fuck with me!
I've been playing hardball since before you were born.
I don't mind playing hardball.
I do mind being taken for a fool.
- Does Diana know?
- She's knows I'm seeking your support.
Which is all I'm doing.
What's your hury, Peter?
- Got a new cure for this county's ills?
- No, not like that.
Only issue I saw you catch fire over was where to eat with those Gucci-assed lobbyists you're so fond of.
So, what is it, boy?
The money sucks.
Food tastes the same.
You still get a year older evey birthday.
The future, Senator.
I want to contribute.
I feel my time is now.
You do, huh?
I'm not going to stand in your way.
My last term's too important to me to take any chances with the election.
But let me tell you something.
You may win an election or two.
You may be able to live with yourself.
But God help you when the people find out.
They always do.
The time is now, John.
Tinker's not running for re-election.
The seat's open.
- Stiles'll back you?
- Yes.
You'll need funding.
Organisation.
More funding.
- It's a lot of orchestrating.
- What could I do to expedite things?
Give a couple of tugs.
Deadline for the Bridgeport project's coming up.
If we got that contract 'cause of you, my friends would be vey impressed.
My friend at Justice has been looking into it, but he's coming up empty.
He's sharp.
He's not missing anything.
There's nothing there.
Yeah.
That's possible.
You knew there was nothing when you had me tip him.
You're letting your line slack.
Look out.
Give me that.
I wanted you in a position to help us.
How?
There's a Justice Department investigation.
Reveal that, New Hampton's out of the running.
It's a big favour.
- He's a friend. I can't set him up.
- He'd never know.
What could happen?
A little hot water.
Isn't that worth it?
I can't do it.
- Come on.
- l got it.
Say I'm the Ghost of Christmas Future.
There you are.
Diana, kids, nice fire.
You're counting blessings.
What's making you runny inside?
Your achievements?
A card from what's-his-name?
"Warmest holiday wishes.
We must get together.
It's been too long."
I think I know the answer.
I just hope you do the right thing.
Thís ís Sam Mínot, New _aven Sentine_.
Is thís Mr Garríty?
Yeah.
I'm doing a stoy on your investigation of the New Hampton Development.
- This is lust a threshold investigation.
- lt's an ínvestígatíon, ísn't ít?
Well, yes, but...
Who are your sources?
- What's so funny?
- Oh, it's just a little ray of sunshine.
- What were you thinking of?
- He called my direct line.
I assumed he'd been cleared.
You're a US attorney!
You don't assume anything!
- No, sir.
- You were ambushed.
Any idea why?
No.
My tip-off was from an aide to Senator Stiles.
He's coming up empty, too.
- What's his name?
- Peter Burton.
He's my best friend.
Someone's got an agenda here, and we're going to find out who.
I'll have to offer you up.
I'm sory, but you're suspended until further notice.
Yes, sir.
Thank you.
- Hello, handsome.
- Hello, beautiful.
- Am I the first one here?
- You're the only one coming.
- What the...?
- Peter wanted us duded up.
- Thought you wouldn't do it.
- He's right.
Where is he?
On the phone.
A drink?
- Scotch.
- No ice.
No ice.
The family crest.
- Are you all right?
- No.
- All my laundy's clean, though.
- They must know it's not your fault.
How long are they keeping you suspended?
Until they can pin it on somebody else.
- You look good.
- You look good, too.
What's the latest?
I was set up by New Hampton's rival.
- Like another developer?
- Yes.
What do you think?
I frisked Palmeri, if that's what you're thinking.
Diana's got a thing about him.
You think I'm sitting on my hands?
Of course I checked John.
- He had nothing to do with it.
- Justice will get to the bottom of it.
They may doze, but they never close.
Excuse me, I've got to check on the lamb.
We like it pink!
You can always hang around here for free grub.
Say yes.
Don't start.
The fact is you're out of work.
At least let me offer to help.
I'm announcing Monday.
Come down.
Let me give you the lay of the land.
Meet some people.
Tim, give me that much.
I'll come watch your announcement.
That's it.
We don't have to feed him now.
- What are we covering today?
- Burton, announcing for Congress.
Hope there's something to eat in there.
The senator's cutting it close.
I still think you ought to open with a fart joke.
- The senator is here.
- Mr Garrity.
Here, Mr Burton.
The senator's speech.
Senator.
There's only one sentence about Peter.
- l said I'd introduce him, that's all.
- What's going on?
- A misunderstanding.
- My ass!
- What good is this going to do?
- What is he talking about?
He said if I didn't back him, he'd leak my illness.
Not like that!
- Are you saying he's lying?
- Sit down!
He's got his version, I've got mine.
Side with your husband for once.
You wanted this, too.
Did you think it would just come to us?
I hate you!
Diana, get back in here!
I'm going out to introduce you, and then our deal is done.
And if you ever do anything to hurt my daughter, I'll destroy you.
- Gentlemen...
- We'll be right out.
Now what do I do?
They're expecting the beautiful wife!
- Hold on.
- l need a joke.
She's nervous...
Did you blackmail him?
I never threatened to use it.
It's me!
It's you.
But it's not a tyre!
- Don't start. I did nothing to you.
- We got to go.
You were right.
Burton was the source of the leak of the investigation.
We think he set you up as a favour to John Palmeri.
His associates got a federal project by taking New Hampton out.
- Burton's had ties to him for years.
- He lives in one of Palmeri's houses.
We believe his campaign is being backed by Palmeri and his associates.
- You're assuming nothing?
- It's all backed up.
We've had an ongoing investigation into Palmeri.
He's tied into racketeering, bribey and fraud in two states.
- What now?
- Nothing.
We've nothing solid enough to go after Palmeri.
As for your pal Burton, fucking you over's not a federal offence.
- Let me go after him.
- What?
Let me work undercover on Burton's campaign.
I could gather evidence on Palmeri.
If Burton's breaking the law, we take it to Public Integrity.
You're not fbi, you're a trial lanyer.
You're not equipped.
He trusts me.
You have somebody's trust, you've all the equipment you need to nail them.
Let me make some calls.
- How you doing, Pete?
- Better now.
Thank you.
- l haven't done anything.
- Thanks for still having faith.
- Where's the Mean Machine?
- Media guy said it looked flam.
How's this look?
Responsible.
- End of an era!
- Yeah.
When I hear about tax breaks for big corporations, I think, "Why give them a break?"
But unless we attract new business to this district and expand our tax base, there won't be a new senior citizen centre, or meals-on-wheels for your housebound friends...
- John Palmeri?
- Yeah?
- Tim Garrity. I'm with Peter.
- How'd you recognise me?
Pete described you.
And you're the only other person here who can walk.
- He looks good.
- Like a Kennedy.
86 the notes.
Get him to memorise.
I keep telling him to.
I wanted to go over strategy with you.
Sure.
Get in.
Now he's a candidate, eveything goes through me.
Requests, advice, money.
Sounds good.
You ticklish?
- What?
- Some guys are.
Come on, let's go.
- He's chery.
- What?
Careful is happy.
Didn't they teach you that at Justice?
I'm out of there. I work for Peter now.
You never know what's bred in the bone.
Accept my apologies.
- Will you respect me in the morning?
- Speak to me.
It's a crime that people live like that.
I want to find the superintendent, the Iandlords. I want some face-to-face now.
How would you do that?
- Can I steal him?
- Just a minute.
Just found out one of Palmeri's companies owns this property.
- What?
- Back off on your speech.
- What shall I say?
- Don't get specific.
"Tomorrow's looking good."
- How are you holding up?
- Fine.
Yeah?
You were pretty tight with Burton.
It's got to be rough.
My old man said that friendship is like the dew.
It settles on some roses and it settles on some dog shit.
Record by pressing the first button.
It's also your mike.
- There's a recorder in the shoulder.
- He has a scanner.
Fibre optics.
Doesn't register.
Bond.
James Bond.
When's your meeting with Palmeri?
- Tomorrow afternoon.
- Want to go over ít agaín?
- Mr Palmeri.
- This way.
Let hím lead, keep ít specífíc, persuade, don't provoke, always be closíng.
- Hey, Tim.
- How you doing?
Are you sure you haven't slípped anywhere?
Nobody knows a thíng.
If it's about playing wifey at his debate, the answer's no.
- Is that final?
- Yes.
- OK.
- Damn it!
That's why you came here, isn't it?
Reconnaissance on his marriage.
That's really pathetic.
- l said I'd talk to you, that's all.
- You did your job, you can go.
No, you can go. I'm going to stay and finish my drink.
I'm sory.
- Want something?
- l'd love a double Stoly.
- Double Stoly...
- No, club soda with lime.
- What's that?
- A new trick I'm learning.
Helps me see things for how they are, instead of how I wish they were.
What do you see?
I see how Peter gets a hold on people.
He's so good at telling you what you want to hear.
How much we want to believe eveything he says.
- It's vey powerful.
- It's not just Peter, that's politicians.
Successful ones.
You can't condemn them.
It's the nature of the beast.
- Don't condemn him?
- He broke no law.
Any more than your father did by letting him do it.
It's a system that's worked for over 200 years, remember?
I think he had something to do with setting you up.
He had nothing to do with that.
What are you doing with him?
This isn't you, playing his game.
I am sory you got hurt.
But just because he wasn't your goddamn perfect man doesn't mean I have to cut him off, too.
I am helping out an old friend, that is all.
- You don't understand.
- No, I don't understand.
You're right.
Diana, be there on election night.
Bring that bottle of champagne you bet him, 'cause I think he might win.
And bring a little faith in me.
You won't be disappointed.
Good eveníng and welcome bach to Election '90 at Channel 3.
Did you hear that?
We got Bridgeport.
Hey, Pete, Channel 8.
Thís ís Connecticut News Tonight wíth the Election '90 Special News.
Hey, Tom.
Yeah.
Well, 1 5 minutes.
So, we're not sure who's won... ln the US Senate race, wíth 530/o of the precíncts reportíng ín,
Channel 8 now projects that Senator James B Stíles has defeated challenger Stuart Hutchínson, returníng Senator Stíles for a fourth term.
Turníng back to the Congressíonal electíon...
Shomime!
In that close race for the fourth Congressíonal dístríct, the Gold Coast, ít's been bemeen former assemblyman Kevín McQuade and Peter Burton.
We now project Peter Burton to be the wínner by a narrow margín over Kevín McQuade.
Come here!
- Congratulations, Mrs Burton.
- Thank you.
Come here!
We fucking did it, man!
It's great!
Way to go, Pete!
Pardon me.
A bet's a bet.
Congratulations.
Listen, Diana, maybe we can sort things out.
No, Peter.
I've filed for a divorce.
McQuade's on the phone.
He's ready to concede.
In a minute.
Diana.
Go ahead.
You've been waiting for this moment your whole life.
Don't start getting regretful.
It's not your style.
Peter, come on.
This is it!
Kevin.
Thank you.
What was I supposed to have faith in?
Sometimes the system works and people are what you'd hoped.
I've lost the faith.
Did you know Peter set me up, or just suspect?
- What?
- Did Palmeri ask him?
Or did he lust offer me up?
Oh, God.
You've known all along.
- Long enough to do something about it.
- Tonight?
The fat lady's warming up.
I'll see you down there.
Peter's accepting in about 20 minutes.
We'll see you in the ballroom.
- Eveybody out.
Give him some air.
- As your new Congressman, I propose you all go downstairs and get a drink.
See you later.
- See you down there.
- All right.
Seven years, my friend.
- Bet settled.
- Unbelievable.
This stuff's a lot more expensive than it was in 1 983, I'll tell you that.
We may not always get what we want or what we need, just so's we don't get what we deserve.
- Congratulations, Congressman.
- Thanks, brother.
No, no.
Hey, I appreciate it, really.
All right.
Give me 15 minutes.
- Where the hell's Palmerí?
- l thought he'd watch hís horse come ín.
He's goíng away.
Maybe he's choosíng whích 100 suíts to take.
Shoes to match.
What does he do at hís constructíon sítes?
- Do they vacuum before he arríves?
- That's íf he ever arríves.
Some píece of work.
- Please!
You don't know the half of ít.
- How much do you know?
More than you.
He's got a hammer-lock on a few union locals.
You don't run a carting company without John as partner.
His wife's got a "catering service" with half the state's hospitals.
- Bitch wouldn't know Jell-O from steak.
- How do you do it?
I'd be nervous.
- We got an arrangement.
- Go along, get along?
- He knows the parameters.
- What if he changes them?
It won't happen. I'm not a puny local official taking envelopes.
- What do you mean?
- l'll tell you a stoy.
Town supervisor, I forgot where, reneges on a variance for one of John's developments.
Comes home one night, found his house burnt down.
Didn't even let the dog out.
Come on, let's drink up.
I got a lot of people to thank.
How did he get so much money into the campaign?
Holding companies, brothers-in-law, friends.
Man's got a lot of friends.
And you owe them all?
Yeah, I owe them all.
Now I'm elected, I'll take care of them.
My time, my way.
Just leave the dog with a neighbour.
What do you owe them right now?
- What is this?
- What's what?
All these questions about Palmeri?
What's with you not looking me in the eye?
Palmeri's being arraigned right now.
They're gonna nail you for accepting illegal kickbacks, conspiracy and obstruction of iustice.
You son of a bitch!
You set me up at Justice.
Why did you do that to me?
That's a lie.
I'll deny we ever had this conversation.
Yes, we did.
Say "cheese".
Fuck you!
Come on, tell me about justice!
Tell me it has nothing to do with me getting Diana.
Tell me this isn't about me coming out ahead of you.
Get up, you self-righteous son of a... lt's easy for you to screw people.
If eveyone's out for you, then it's OK.
Garrity!
fbi !
Get out!
I'm sory for what I did to you.
- l had no choice.
- Course you did.
I got instinct and some moves.
Choice is for guys like you.
Diana married you.
You chose to make her regret it with eveything that you had.
Stiles took you under his wing and you chose to blackmail him.
I was your friend and you chose to betray me.
You did this to yourself.
Why?
I needed more than you could give, you or Diana or any one person.
They say great men are embraced by thousands of strangers.
I want to be great.
So you sacrificed a few to reach the many.
They believe in me down there.
And you can't take that away.
They won't let you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
You know, for the past couple of months, I've been saying tomorrow's looking good.
I'll tell you a secret, tonight's feeling great.
First of all, I want to thank my campaign family.
Because of your fantastic dedication and energy, we're here tonight.
With your hopes and dreams in our hearts, we're going to Washington.
In the past few months, as I've met the fíne people of thís dístríct, I've come to thínk of you not just as voters, but as famíly, as fríends.
And that's how I want you to thínk of me.
As your friend in Washington, as your brother in Congress.
I'm listening, and what's more, I hear you.
One of the questions I've been asked, over and over again during the campaign is, "Peter Burton,
"why should I trust you?
"Why should I believe in you?"
It's a tough question.
The tough answer is because I'm not afraid to admit that I'm human.
I'm one of you.
I'm motivated, I'm proud, I'm competitive and, yeah, sometimes I'm a little headstrong.
- Does that sound familiar?
- Yes!
I'm one of you.
And I'll tell you something.
Where there's an "Us" there's a "Them".
In smom back rooms, here in our district, they're trading on our tomorrows for their own gain.
In the past few months one of these men invited me in,
and I let him think I was for sale.
Not Peter Burton!
As you'll soon find out, I was so good at it that some lanyers from Washington really thought I was for sale.
That's the case they'll ty to make.
I put it to you, was I too motivated?
Is it possible?
Too headstrong?
Perhaps.
Less than circumspect?
Definitely.
But I did what any one of you would've done.
Tell it to the people who can't find a home.
Tell it to the people who can't find a decent job, who can't send their children to decent schools.
I did what you would've done.
I saw an opportunity to get a jump on these guys, and I seized it.
I took that risk for one reason.
I took that risk for you.
We love you, Peter!
In the hopes that one day I would be here with you at my side, to take back our tomorrows from these crooks and these schemers, and to send a message to Washington that we're in charge and tomorrow's looking good!
Garríty's on hís way down.
Here he comes.
A damn good lob.
- Ready?
- He's in his suite.
Let him call his lanyer, then bring him down the back way.
- Good work.
- Get enough?
- Plenty.
- Good.
That's good.
- You OK?
- Fine.
Wish he'd lost.
Spare him humiliation on the front page.
Win or lose, he's front page.
If not you, it would've been somebody else.
But it is me.
He was my best friend and I used that to fuck him.
Just like he did to you.
You're even.
You signed on to Justice all full of fire to set things right.
And you're good.
But until tonight, it never cost you.
You don't own it until it costs you.
They're bringing him down.
If I lost, I'd bring you a case of champagne.
Well, I got elected, but doesn't look like I'm going to get sworn in.
So, there's the champagne.
Bet settled.
I'm sory it ended up like this.
- l second that.
- What are you going to do?
They offered me immunity if I testify against Palmeri.
Nobody said anything about immunity from Palmeri.
Or I can take my chances. I heard you took yourself off the case.
Thanks.
- No deal and I'll have to testify.
- l know.
- l've got to get going.
- Yeah.
But save a bottle of that champagne.
We'll make it an ongoing bet.
You know the old saying in Washington.
Only two things can truly wreck a man's political career:
getting caught with a live boy or a dead girl.
- Good luck, Pete.
- See you around campus, man.
Here comes Jim.
He's just swell.
You can tell, he does it for the money.
Here comes Jim, tall and trim.
Put your hands together and welcome him.
Let's hear for the Jim Dancers, ladies and gentlemen.
Come on, give it up!
The Jim Dancers.
Come on, let's hear it.
The Jim Dancers, yeah!
The Jim Dancers, woo!
The Jim Dancers all right.
There they go!
Give it to them.
Well, good evening ladies and gentlemen, my name is Jim Carrey, and how are you this evening, all righty then.
I grew up in Canada.
Is there anybody here from Canada?
Now, I used to get really upset, when I told people where I came from down to Los Angeles.
Because I always got the same response.
"Canada?
Wow.
Must've been cold."
Now I just go along with them.
"Yes.
Canada.
It was a frozen hostile wasteland.
And there was much work to be done.
If we were to survive the elements after boring a hole through the ice to find food, my good friend Nantuk and I,
would build an igloo to protect ourselves from polar bears and flying hokey pucks.
Then... then we would drink a lot of beer.
And when Nantuk was ready, he would tell me the story of the great moose who said to the little squirrel,
'Hey, Rockey!
Watch me pull a rabbit out of my hat!
'"
Anyway...
Anyway, I'm here tonight and I feel good.
Really good.
Excellent.
Super.
I just wanna go, go!
Go!
Go!
I think, those subliminal motivation tapes are starting to make a difference.
Yeah, that's right, I listen to motivational tapes.
Think, I wanna get stuck in this dead end job?
No, sorry, not me!
I wanna do something... wonderful.
I wanna be one of those gospel singers on a PTL club.
'Cause those guys are just happy no matter what.
I think I saw him on the hill the other day.
I think I saw him when I watched the children play.
But when I opened up my voice to sing him praise, he ran away.
Ran away.
Far away.
My singing made sweet Jesus run away.
I did not have to wait for Judgment Day, because my song
made the Good Lord...
Imagine if you could actually be that happy.
That would be powerful, man.
People would be tunneling under the street to avoid you.
"Oh, man...
Is the happy guy still out there?"
"Honey!
Looks like I gonna be late again!
No, it's the happy guy.
He's right beside the car, I can't get near it."
Of course, if I wanna to be that happy, I'd have to forget all of my problems.
And the only time I forget all my problems is when I'm right smack dab in the middle of sexual orgasm.
So I have them as often as I can.
I'm having one right now.
Ever had one of those really smooth orgasms?
Turns you into Elvis.
I think, that's how Elvis got that way, actually.
But that's my only escape.
You know.
Sure, I could go on a vacation.
But I'd still be thinking about what I gotta do when I come home.
See, to me, an orgasm is like... a mini vacation.
But it's better, because you can't think about anything when you have one.
"Oh man, I'm way behind in the red..."
"My kids need braces.
What am I gonna do?"
And you're right back into the pain of life, you know.
But for thirty seconds, man, you're free.
All you can think about is,
"What the hell am I gonna grab on to?
Gee, I hope, the person I'm with doesn't do anything stupid, like move!"
You ever been with somebody who wanted to just keep on moving?
I used to keep a brick under my pillow for people like that.
"It's over!
Let it go!"
"We won't go out with her again."
That's the only time.
That's the only time I'm really truly free.
The rest of the time, I sit around and I worry about the stupidest things.
Just stupid things.
Ideas.
Like, what would you do, if you found out your mom and dad went to hell?
Wouldn't it just ruin the rest of your life?
You'd be walking around,
"They taught me everything I know.
I even look like them!"
Of course, my mom would drive the devil crazy.
If she ever went to hell.
She'd spend eternity going,
"Something's burning.
I can smell that!"
My mom could always smell something burning, man.
I spent half my childhood feeling the walls for hot spots.
Nine times out of ten it was my father.
See, like a lot of smokers, his favorite cigarette of the day was that one right after dinner.
You know.
During his nap.
Fun watch him to wake up though.
"Oh god!"
"Drop and roll, dad!"
I just worry too much, though, I don't know.
Maybe there is nothing to worry about, maybe... maybe, there is no actual place called hell.
Maybe hell is... having to listen to your grandparents breath through their nose when they're eating a sandwich.
Get that humming thing.
It's not a meal, it's a struggle for life itself.
"I think, I'll make another one!"
"Noooo!
No...
We'll be good."
Here's a scary concept though.
Getting old... you can't do that.
You gotta kiss that stuff goodbye, man.
I just wanna keep challenging myself, you know.
I don't wanna become the reminiscing guy, you know, people run into at bars and stuff.
Can always tell how boring their life is by how far back they have to reach for glory.
They're like,
"Remember... remember, how fast I used to be... when I was a sperm!
I'll never forget the day of the big race.
There were millions of us in the field.
But I beat them all to fertilize that egg, mister.
Back in the cervix
I was semen first class."
Don't wanna be like that.
See, for me, for me, Jimmy Stewart is the kind of guy that I'd love to be.
It's very difficult to be that though.
You know?
I mean, he is just kinda up here somewhere.
And I just want...
I love him, man.
It's a great example of somebody who's had an incredibly productive life.
Seems like no matter what happens, no matter how bad things get,
Jimmy Stewart can look at it in a positive way.
"Well, I guess we gonna have ourselves a nuclear holocaust.
Oh, hey, everybody, come on over the window!
Look at that mushroom cloud.
Isn't it beautiful?
And... and the amazing thing to me is that-that something so... magnificent,
colorful could just... melt your face right off."
That's positive energy.
You know?
You gotta look death right in the face.
That's what Jimmy Stewart would do.
"Hi, mister Death, you look like you could use some soup."
I'd wanna be like that, man.
Maybe I will be.
Maybe someday after I'm finished singing the gospel
I'll go even further and become a real holy man.
And I'm not talking about the kind of holy men you see on TV, those TV evangelists.
They are not holy men.
They are just ambitious.
I saw one guy who was so ambitious, he actually became jealous of the Lord.
You could tell, it came out, half way through the ceremony he said,
"When I was a child,
I wanted to be the savior of the world.
Then they told me that Jesus was the Son of God and I realize it's all who you know."
Very petty, petty people.
You know?
Can't be like that, if you wanna be a holy man.
And you gotta be sure of yourself, too, when you make a decision, you cannot waver in any way, you gotta stick with it.
You'd never see Gandhi during a hunger strike sneaking into the kitchen in the middle of the night.
"Gandhi?
What are you doing down here?"
"Um,
I thought I heard a prowler... and I was going to hit him over the head with this giant bowl of potato salad."
He would never put himself in that position.
You know?
And you gotta control your temper constantly, you know.
You cannot fly off the handle at any moment.
You gotta be right in the center.
Jesus was very composed his whole live and right up to the end.
If that was me, I'd be up there going,
"Great!
Just beautiful!
You guys are gonna get it.
Wait till my father hears about it."
That'd be a whole different book, man.
Then there are those weird impulses we get constantly.
You know?
We have to fight them off every days of our lives.
Those mad little...
impulses we get.
And everybody gets them, too.
Like you'd be with a friend.
Could be your best friend in a whole world, standing about two feet away, talking to you.
You are thinking,
"My goodness.
I could just fire out and hit him right now.
He would never expect it."
See, madness is never that far away!
It's as close as saying yes to the wrong impulse.
But people who stay sane are the people who can make those quick decisions.
"Should I stick my finger into the fan... or leave the room right now?"
"Should I run the blade of this razor across my tongue... or just finish shaving and move away from the sink?"
Come on, you're right there!
But you don't, because luckily most of us have that little voice inside our head, that says,
"Turning the car in the oncoming traffic is counterproductive!"
Imagine if we didn't have that voice, man.
I wouldn't even be here right now.
I'd be in the shark tank at Sea World.
"He's got my legs, he's got my legs!"
We'd be apologizing till the end of time.
"Hi, how are you?
Sorry, man."
You, guys, enjoying the show?
Wow, excuse me, jeez!
Sorry about that, just came into my head and I made a decision.
I don't know.
It's a...
I hate to turn my back on the audience, I really do.
I think, nine out of ten of the worst impulses we get, though, are when we are behind the wheel of a car.
You know?
That's why I don't think it's a good idea to carry a gun in the glove compartment!
'Cause chances are, if it's there, sooner or later you gonna use it.
Of course, then again, what are you gonna do, if somebody cuts you off in the freeway.
Just let them go?
!
You pretty much have to shoot them, you know.
Otherwise they won't learn nothing.
Or... say, all of a sudden you have to go on a real killing spree and all you have is a knife.
Well, after the couple of people your arm is aching.
You have to switch hands and you look like a girl.
"Stop laughing and die!"
Who needs that kind of aggravation, man?
When there are automatic weapons on sale!
That's why a lot of my friends are taking martial arts classes and stuff like that.
Which I think is a really good idea.
Anybody in the martial arts here?
Come on!
Right now, baby!
Try and penetrate my crab's hands!
"He's a crustacean!
Somebody get some boiling water!"
I think, that's a good idea to know how to defend yourself, though.
I really do.
I just wish the people who took martial arts would master the technique before they go around showing it off.
Because it's really annoying when they come up to you and go,
"Hey, man.
I just learned this incredible new move in karate today.
But you gotta come at me like this."
Jeez, is there anything I can do to make it easier for ya?
Maybe I can put my head under the back wheel of your car?
!
"Hey!
I'm a mugger!
Kick me in the groin and I pop my eyes out!"
That's how it goes down in the street.
That's how it goes down, man.
"Give me you money!"
"No!"
"All right, then I'm gonna have to stab ya.
With my right hand in a lunging fashion.
Try to keep your weight on a back leg."
What world is this!
What wonderful world!
"Gee, he does it all!"
Of course I don't think we'd need any of this stuff if we'd just communicate to each other.
Of course, if you wanted to do that, you'd have to find some kinda language that everyone understood.
Myself, I think that's music.
I happen to love it.
"How am I Supposed to Live Without You" (Michael Bolton)
"What happened to him?"
"I don't know, he tried to sing like Michael Bolton, something just popped in his head."
That guy tries really hard, doesn't he?
No, he puts a lot into a song, come on!
He is 99% effort, that man.
God, I'd hate to...
I'd hate to go to one of his concerts.
By the end of it he'd have a big bubble on his head.
They want an encore, cut me!
I love the way he sings, I'm just afraid for him, that's all.
Oh, we should open up the parameters, of the music we listen to, you know?
It really bothers me that the people in this country don't know about the incredible pop music coming out of the Middle East right now.
I like to be the one who bring it to the West.
Come on, clap your hands, I'll do it myself.
We don't get to listen to that, do we.
What's going on, man?
It's all about payola, isn't it?
We should try to put ourselves in their shoes.
For a change.
Wake up in the morning.
Pick the sand out of your teeth.
Turn on that radio dial.
"That was 'Hatiba' by Cool Abdul.
Coming up next Libya rap.
DJ Jazzy Mahakhnubar.
And a fresh Rafsanjani.
But first, a word from our hostage."
"They mean business!
Send more guns!"
Communication.
Hardest thing in the world.
You know, I can look at you, guys, I can communicate to you all night, but one on one...
I'm terrible.
Just the certain things about communicating that really bother me.
You know?
Like whenever I meet somebody new, I say,
"Hi!
How are you?"
Most of the time people hear that, they'll say something like,
"Good, and yourself?"
"I'm fine, thank you very much!"
But sometimes they like to surprise you.
"I've got no dream, man.
I'm all dead inside!"
"I'm sorry, wrong answer, but thank you for playing!"
Man, if I'm worried about something, I don't even leave my house anymore.
Because I know, there is five people waiting out there somewhere just to ask me that question.
"Hey, Jim!
How are you?"
And I go, "Really good.
Please, look away.
Danger!
Danger!
Danger!"
I should change the response or something, you know?
"How am I?
Jee, I don't know.
Let me check.
I'd like to do a few more tests..."
Thank you.
The weird thing is, though, we've gotten so used to hearing this
"hi, how are you", that if somebody doesn't say it, we answer it anyway.
"Hi, Bob!"
"Good, and you?"
And the conversation goes nowhere.
Because all you can here is that voice in your head going,
"He thinks you're an idiot.
He's gonna tell everyone.
Kill him!
Kill hiiim!"
And you have to make one of those decisions again, you know.
See, I think, body language is the communication of the future.
For instance, if you're staying like this, it means, "Hey, girls!
I'm single and I have a curvature of the spine!"
You gotta put it out there, you know.
And guys, seriously, the walk is everything.
The walk is the most important element.
If you wanna whole room full of ladies to know what you want without them getting a wrong idea, walk into a singles bar like this.
See, this puts out a definite message, you know.
It says, "Listen!
Listen, I could care less, but... my crotch would like to buy you a beer."
You gotta do something like that, you know.
Believe me, these days women have heard every line there is to say.
Guys, you gotta get in there with something visual and distract them.
"Hey, baby!
Come here for a second.
Yeah, you, come on over here.
Listen, uh...
Listen, do you... do you find it unusually windy today?"
Thank you very much, you guys have been great!
I had a wonderful time, thank you!
[SCREAMING]
This is Andy Barclay.
Eight years ago he touched off the scandal... that nearly crippled this company, claiming that his Good Guy doll, Chucky, was possessed by...
Charles Lee Ray, the notorious Lakeshore Strangler.
Now I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, after the lawsuits and negative publicity, when the company is finally getting back on its feet, where is the wisdom in putting the Good Guy back on the market?
Mr. Sullivan, before this happened... the Good Guy outsold our other toys 2 to 1 .
Even now, interest in the marketplace is at its peak.
The factory is up and running again.
We should be in stores by next week.
We cannot let the fantasies of one disturbed boy... influence company policy.
What if the doll somehow... affects another child in a negative way?
You could have a public relations nightmare.
One of the hardest things about this business is... that it is a business.
Doesn't matter what we're selling.
Whether it's cars nuclear weapons ..
or yes, even toys.
The bottom line is the bottom line.

Andy Barclay is ancient history.
No one remembers him.
Nobody cares.
I have made up my mind.
We're moving ahead.
Thank you.
Okay.
All right.
Mr. Sullivan.
if there's nothing I can say to convince you, then I must go on record.
I'm completely against this.
Your position is crystal clear, Miles.
And you can be sure I won't forget.
Just a minute, folks.
Mr. Sullivan, we have a surprise.
Guys at the factory sent this over.
First off the assembly line, the Good Guy of the '90s.
[CLAPPING]
If there's nothing else, I'm gonna get going.
Fine. it's just, my wife's expecting me.
It's our anniversary.
Fine, Petzold.
I could review the Larrabee report after dinner.
Good night, Mr. Sullivan.
Good night.
[ELEVATOR BELL DINGS]
Ahh.
Despite a downdraft in the bond market, stocks were able to post a rally on friday... thanks to a couple of different factors.
Not only did the employment report allay recession fears, but also there was a technical rebound in buying... and a resurgence in deal stocks helped set the tone.
Here's a look at the numbers.
The Dow industrial's up 1 6.
The transportation average up 3.
Utilities bouncing up--

In a moment's time --
Oh, shit.

Left, left Left, left.
I see for the past eight years... you've been in one foster home after another.
Mind if I ask why?
They took me away from my mother.
She's under special care.
I know that.
How come you never got settled an_here?
Adjustment problems.
I can read, Barclay.
I'm asking you.
I never felt comfortable with those people.
They weren't family.
They were strangers.
All right, listen up, Barclay.
I'm willing to cut you some slack, because you've had it rough.
But you're a troublemaker.
And I got a problem with troublemakers.
They don't fit into the system.
So here's my advice.
Grow up!
You're not a kid anymore.
It's time to forget these fantasies of killer dolls.
Yes, sir.

Kiss it good-bye.
The Romans invented the military cut.

Why?
To keep their hair short, so their enemies couldn't grab it in battle... and slit their throat.

What happened?
Shelton!
That's what happened!
Shelton and his goddamn lackeys.
Thank you.
I'm fine.
I'm Andy.
You must be new.
Otherwise... you'd know they don't tolerate individuality, nothing as personal as a first name.
Right.
I forgot.
- Barclay.
- Whitehurst.
Harold Aubrey, for the record.
So, who's this Shelton?
Cadet lieutenant Colonel Brett C. Shelton.
He's God around here.
Don't expect mercy from him.
Welcome to hell, Barclay.
All present and accounted for, sir.
Thank you, Major Ellis.
You're new boy, huh?
Yeah.
How you doing?
Pretty good.
Who said you could look at me?
Do you know who I am?
Shelton?
That's Lieutenant Colonel Shelton to you, asshole!
[ANDY] Lieutenant Colonel Shelton.
Lieutenant Colonel...
Shelton... sir.
Lieutenant Colonel Shelton, sir.
-What's your name, dipweed?
- Barclay.
- Sir.
- Louder.
- Louder!
- Sir!
That's much better, new boy.
That's much better.
Shit, Whitehurst.
You are without a doubt... the most pathetic thing I have ever seen!
Wouldn't you agree?
I asked you a question, nimrod.
No, sir!
I don't agree, sir!
Are you contradicting me, you sorry-ass sack of shit?
You asshole.
- What did you say?
- I said, "You asshole;' sir!
Think you're pretty funny, don't you, De Silva?
Yes, I do, sir.
Drop and give me 25.
Right now.
25 what, sir?
25 push-ups, De Silva.
One, sir!
Two, sir!
Three, sir!
You women might think... that because you're so much more delicate... you deserve special treatment... and once a month... we're gonna get out of your way.

He'll write when he gets a chance.
I know.
Hey!
I got a job for you.
Give this to the new kid for me.

- Yes, sir.
That a boy.
Out of the way.
Watch it, kid.
Hey!
Look out!
A Good Guy.

Who the fuck are you?
I thought you guys only said three sentences.
I'm new and improved.
I never saw a doll like you before.
All right, kid.
Fun's over.
Where the hell's Andy?
Andy?
Can't you read?
He was supposed to get this package.
Tampering with the mail is a federal offense.
Sorry.
Is he your best friend?
He's more than that.
He's my new lease on life.
Wait a minute.
I got a new body... and I ain't told anyone about my little secret yet.
So, what's your name, kid?
Tyler.
What's yours?
Chucky.
But my real name... is Charles Lee Ray.
[SHOOTING]
Whitehurst, what am I doing wrong?
ls there anything you can't do?
Yeah.
I can't get thrown out of this place.
Barclay, meet De Silva.
Hi.
Hi.
So, you want to show me?
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
No, put the elbow like that.
And like this.
No.
Keep both eyes open.
Keep your sights on the target.
Hold your breath.
Squeeze the trigger.
Don't pull it.
[GUNSHOT]
You're not concentrating.
It was great what you did for us at formation.
Shelton's a major dick.
Tell me about it.

What are you doing, Tyler?
We're playing "Hide the Soul."
I'll catch up with you.
I'll start loading the paint guns.
We don't play with dolls, do we?
Dolls are for girls.
But Charles is my new best friend.
You know better than to talk back to a superior.
Yes, sir.
Clean that up.
I'll take care of this.

It's not a baton, Barclay.
You look like a goddamn majorette over here.
I'm not used to guns, sir.
Does this look like a gun to you, Barclay?
It's a rifle.
- Major Ellis!
- Sir!
Show the new boy the difference.
This is my rifle.
This is my gun.
This is for shooting and this is for fun.
A soldier's rifle is his best friend.
Remember that.
Stop!

What are you doing?
What's it look like?
I'm polishing Shelton's shoes.
He makes you polish his shoes?
No, I offered out of the kindness of my heart.
Whitehurst, did you see Cochrane with that doll today?
No, what doll?
He was carrying a Good Guy doll... just before the accident with the garbage truck.
Good Guys.
I remember those.
Yeah, me too.
[SPITTING]
Lights out in a few minutes.
I'm gonna go get washed up.
I almost forgot.
Sgt. Clark wanted to know if you got that package.
What package?
He said you got a package in the mail.
Tyler was supposed to bring it to you.
Didn't you get it?
No.
Who would have sent me a package?
Hey, long time no see, pal!
No, you're dead!
We killed you!
You know what they say.
"You just can't keep a good guy down."
[LAUGHING]
Andy, how you've grown.
You're not gonna kill me.
You need to transfer your soul.
Wrong again, wimp.
I got some fresh meat lined up.
I'm not gonna let you spoil it this time.
- Tyler?
- Yeah.
Just think.
Chucky's gonna be a "bro."
I'm not gonna let you get away with this.
I'm not gonna let you near that kid.
Agh!
[LAUGHING]
What's the matter?
You homesick?
You miss your mommy?
What the fuck is this?
I'm sorry about your shoe.
I'll polish it.
Give me back the doll.
No, you listen to me.
Tell Whitehurst he's off the hook.
I got myself another slave.
Clean up this mess.
You got five demerits.
What about the doll?
My kid sister's birthday's coming up.
I think she's gonna Cove it, don't you?
[CLOSET DOOR CREAKING]
[WHISPERING] Oh, shit.
Andy.
What the fuck?
No, stop!
What the fuck you doing in my room?
You wouldn't believe me.
Where's the doll Barclay?
Where's the fucking doll?
You took it, didn't you?
No!
What's going on?
Somebody sure as hell took it.
It's almost midnight.
Is this necessary?
I'm tying to weed out a thief. sir.
You've always told me how important it is... to uphold the school's code of honor.
All right, make your point.
But I want everybody back in at 01.00 hours.
Yes, sir.
By the time we get through with Barclay, he's gonna be living in a world full of shit.
We got an hour, so let's make it count.
Yes, sir.
Ladies, get those weapons in the air.
I want to see them high.
Higher!
I think I'm gonna throw up.
You're dead, new boy.

I hope he can take care of himself.
Shh, shh.

Just stay here and keep an eye out.
Oh, I live for this.

Okay.

No wonder he's so quiet.

What was that?
So, you took the doll?
Shelton will have you court-martialed.
We're playing hide-and-seek.
What are you doing?
We couldn't sleep.
Oh, he is... so cute.
He was mine first.
Give him back.
Shh, you guys.
Please be quiet!
Can you go stand guard?
Yes, sir.

Ask him yourself.
Oh, right.
What is your name?

Give me your lipstick.
What for?
Just give it to me.
What are you doing?
Wait, stop.
You'll see.

[TYLER] You're messing him up.
You're so cute.
Don't do that.
He looks stupid!
You're making him look like a wuss!

What are you doing?

It's gettin' pretty shaggy, Carlson.
I want to see you on Friday.
Yes, sir.
Monday, Fabrizzio.

Look at you, Whitehurst.
You're a disgrace.
When's the last time you had a trim?
Two weeks ago, Sergeant, I think.
You think?
I want to see you right after breakfast.
Yes, sir, Sergeant Botnick, sir.
What're you looking at, new boy?
Wednesday.
Barclay, what're you doing?
You can't just get up in the middle of mess.
Major.
At ease!
Tyler.
Hi, Barclay.
What's up?
I've got to talk to you about Chucky.
You mean Charles.
Have you seen him?
Not since last night.
He's hiding somewhere.
He's gonna lay low until he knows you're alone, and he's gonna come after you.
He wants to play.
Listen to me.
No matter what he says, no matter what he promises you, you've gotta stay away from him.
Don't let him fool you.
He's bad.
Charles isn't bad, he's a Good Guy.
It says so on his shirt.
He lies, Tyler.
Believe me, he's bad news.
He's hurt a lot of people.
I think Colonel Cochrane was one of them.
You're just jealous because he's my best friend now instead of yours.
Look, you better keep this.
Whitehurst, you are, without a doubt the sorriest excuse for a soldier to ever disgrace these walls.
Face it, you're not cut out for this life.
Why don't you do yourself a favor and get the hell out of Kent?
If I had any choice in the matter, I would, sir.
Smart ass.
Presto... you're bald.
[WHISTLING]
What the hell?
How'd you get in there?
That haircut ain't regulation, soldier.
When's the last time you had a trim, huh?
Kiss it good-bye.
Presto...
you're dead.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
It's definitely you.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
I just forgot my --
Boo!
The annual war games... have been an unbroken tradition here at Kent for over 50 years.
Colonel Cochrane was a man who believed in tradition.
He not only would have wanted us to go on, he'd have ordered us to go on.
Therefore... the war games.... will proceed as scheduled.
Lieutenant Colonel Shelton... will command the blue team.
Major Rawlings will head up the reds.
The objective is simple.
To capture the other team's flag... and bring it back here safely to base.
Rawlings.
You will pick up your weapons... in the armory before moving out.
You will be using the standard issue Springfield aught-three.
Your ammo--
Shelton.
If you get hit, you are dead.
Hike back to base.
Commanders... take charge of your teams.
May the best team win.
Good luck, men and women.
Nice of you to join us.
Looks like Botnick's in a pretty bad mood today.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing's wrong.
I'm fine.

You saw Chucky.
Don't wimp out on me!
I need your help.
That kid needs your help.
I didn't see anything.
Okay?
I didn't see anything at all.
Your left, right, your left.
Your military left.
Ellis, let's make sure all the perimeters are secure.
Yes, sir.
She checks the windows.
And the baby-sitter hears this thump, thump, thumping.
Like something's being dragged across the floor upstairs.
Suddenly she thinks, "I haven't checked on the children."
So she hurries to the top of the stairs, and when she gets there... she sees her boyfriend completely dismembered, dragging himself across the floor by his chin.
Thump, slide.
Thump, slide.
Thump, slide.
[IVES] That was gross.
Hey, you guys, I got a better story... and it's true.
It's about this mental institution... and it's a few miles away from here.
Hey.
Hope it wasn't something I said.
[CHUCKLES] No.
I'm sorry.
Where do you think the red team's camped out?
Could be any here.
Shelton'll find 'em, he always does.
By the way, you can call me Kristin.
What?
Kristin.
It's my first name.
Do you have one?
Andy.
Come on, Andy.
I want to show you something.
Pretty cool, huh?
Yeah, I almost forgot there were places like that... where people just go to have fun.
[TWIG SNAPS] Listen!
Somebody's out there.
It's probably just a chipmunk or something.
Nothing scares you, does it?
No.
Man, I gotta get out of this body.
I'm going after Tyler.
Are you crazy?
You'll never find him.
Wanna bet?
I swiped this from Shelton's tent.
He sent out a reconnaissance mission right before we pitched camp.
The red team is somewhere around here.
That kid's a sitting duck, Whitehurst.
Are you with me... or not?
I'm sorry, I can't.
[ELLIS] Up and at 'em, ladies.
We're movin' out.
I want this camp to be a ghost town in five minutes.
I thought we weren't going till dawn, sir.
Someone stole the reconnaissance map, so we're making Our move now.
Get going, Hanley.
You wouldn't know anything about a missing map, would you?
Where the hell's Barclay?
Whitehurst!
Colonel Shelton, you better have a look in here, sir.
What is it, Ellis?
Barclay's gone AWOL, sir.
He stole the map.
That little fucking traitor's doubling for the reds.
Where's Tyler?
He went AWOL with some guy named Charles.
Where's Andy?
Whitehurst, where is he?
[SHELTON] Platoon, halt!
All right.
De Silva, you're gonna take the right flank.
Siegel, take the left.
Check in on the radio every five minutes.
Yes, sir.
All right, move it.
The rest of us are gonna spread out and meet up with Ellis at Split Rock.
Move out.
Whitehurst, move!
Thanks for coming after me.
What are friends for?
Duck!
That was a close one.
Now we can play "Hide the Soul."
I'm tired.
I don't wanna play that dumb game anymore.
You're a fuckin' drag, you know that?
- Watch your mouth, Charles.
- Stop calling me that!
What's the knife for?
A good soldier is always prepared.
Barclay w_s right.
You're not a good guy.
Sorry kid.
You got me.
I'm bad.
Now... assume the position.
No!
Aaah!
Get back here!
Barclay!
Barclay!
Tyler!
You fuckin' traitor.
Give me my map!
Listen -
- You got any idea what we do to traitors, Barclay?
Tyler's in trouble.
Whitehurst, back me up.
Major Ellis, call in the flanks.
Yes, sir.
De Silva, Siegel, do you copy?
De Silva, do you copy?
[RADIO] De Silva, come in.
Aaah!
Siegel's on his way back.
No word yet from De Silva.
Keep trying'.
Yes, sir.
Help!
Tyler!
Barclay!
Are you okay, Tyler?
Looks like we got ourselves a little P.O.W. You're right,
Charles is bad.
He tried to hurt me.
Who the hell's Charles?
[CHUCKY] Come in, Barclay.
Who the hell is that?
It's Charles.
Who is this?
Put Barclay on, jarhead.
[ELLIS] It's the reds.
They're up to something.
What do you want?
I want the kid.
Bring him up to the old Jeep or there'll be hell to pay.
[DE SILVA] Andy, don't do it.
De Silva!
You hear that, Barclay?
Don't touch her, you son of a bitch.
Now bring me the kid or I'll waste her.
Red team, red team.
come in, red team.
This is red team, over.
We got a situation up here at the old Jeep.
Blue team sighted.
Advise you to move your troops in.
Hope they like the taste of lead.
Now just sit back and watch the sparks fly.
All right, you two are gonna go on up ahead.
The rest of us are gonna circle around.
Shelton, this is no game.
This guy is dangerous.
Relax, Barclay, it's only paint.
All right, let's do it.
I'm scared, Barclay.
Yeah, me too.
All right, kid.
Get over here!
No!
Don't fuck with me!
I'll blow all of you to pieces.
Beat it!
Now just get down and shut up.
Yeah!
Ow!
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
De Silva, where the hell is everybody?
Hi, soldier.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Fuck me.
All right!
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

Stay down!
They're using live rounds!
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Hold your fire!

Hold your fire!
Oh, God, he's not breathing!
Get away from him!
You did this, didn't you?
You sick son of a bitch.
Now I'm gonna kill you!
Get off me!
Get off of him, he didn't do it!
Let go of me!
"Sayonara", suckers.
Look out!
No!
Oh, my God, what happened?
[ELLIS] It's Whitehurst.
What the hell happened?
Who fucked with the rifles?
I don't know.
[ELLIS] Get Clark on the radio...
Yes, sir.

[ELLIS] All right, everybody stay calm.
Epstein, I want that radio!
Oh, God.
[LOUD ROCK MUSIC] This is the last time I'm gonna tell you.
Give that thing a rest or you're out of here, both of you.
We're not bothering anybody.
You're bothering me.
Keep it down!
Geez!
Mister, you gotta help me!
What's wrong?
Charles, Charles he's after me.
Who's Charles?
He's a Good Guy.
He wants to play "Hide the Soul."
Have a seat over there.
Are you from Kent?
Yes, sir.
What's your name, son?
Ronald Tyler.
Private first class, sir.
Have a seat.
How 'bout some gum, Private?
I know how it must hurt... when a friend does something bad to you.
Sure does.
But I bet your friend -- what's his name, Charles?
I bet you Charles didn't mean it.
I bet you he's really sorry.
No, he isn't.
He wants to hurt me.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
I know what'll cheer you up.
Look what I found.
There you go.
Thank you, Daddy.
Let's go on the Super Loop.
Hey, maybe somebody's seen him.
Oh, God.
Come on.
Wait.
Mommy, Mommy, I loved it!
Were you scared?

[Screaming]
This is Andy Barclay.
Eight years ago he touched off the scandal... that nearly crippled this company, claiming that his Good Guy doll, Chucky, was possessed by...
Charles Lee Ray, the notorious Lakeshore Strangler.
Now I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, after the lawsuits and negative publicity, when the company is finally getting back on its feet, where is the wisdom in putting the Good Guy back on the market?
Mr. Sullivan, before this happened... the Good Guy outsold our other toys 2 to 1 .
Even now, interest in the marketplace is at its peak.
The factory is up and running again.
We should be in stores by next week.
We cannot let the fantasies of one disturbed boy... influence company policy.
What if the doll somehow... affects another child in a negative way?
You could have a public relations nightmare.
One of the hardest things about this business is... that it is a business.
Doesn't matter what we're selling.
Whether it's cars nuclear weapons ..
or yes, even toys.
The bottom line is the bottom line.
And what are children but consumer trainees?
Andy Barclay is ancient history.
No one remembers him.
Nobody cares.
I have made up my mind.
We're moving ahead.
Thank you.
Okay.
All right.
Mr. Sullivan.
if there's nothing I can say to convince you, then I must go on record.
I'm completely against this.
Your position is crystal clear, Miles.
And you can be sure I won't forget.
Just a minute, folks.
Mr. Sullivan, we have a surprise.
Guys at the factory sent this over.
First off the assembly line, the Good Guy of the '90s.
[Clapping]
If there's nothing else, I'm gonna get going.
Fine. it's just, my wife's expecting me.
it's our anniversary.
Fine, Petzold.
I could review the Larrabee report after dinner.
Good night, Mr. Sullivan.
Good night.
[Elevator Bell Dings]
Ahh.
Despite a downdraft in the bond market, stocks were able to post a rally on friday... thanks to a couple of different factors.
Not only did the employment report allay recession fears, but also there was a technical rebound in buying... and a resurgence in deal stocks helped set the tone.
Here's a look at the numbers.
The Dow industrial's up 1 6.
The transportation average up 3.
Utilities bouncing up--
Utilities bouncing up--
ln a moment's time --
Oh, shit.
[Tv] Bonds headed south on the economic data, which served to bolster the U.S. dollar.
The dollar index up a quarter point.
The CRB index up... point 43 at two-thirty point 43.
March crude up...

[Laughing]
Don't fuck with the Chuck.
Oh, my God.
[Yelling]
Just like the good old days.
Nothing like a strangulation to get the circulation going.
You're my only ticket out of here, Andy.
I gotta get out of this goddamn body.
Where are you, you little shit?
lnward hut.
Come on, come on.
Yeah,you can do it.
You can do it, Jackson, hury up.
Come on, let's go.
Yeah, come on.
Get moving.
Go to the end of the line.
[Drum Playing]
Left, left Left, left.
I see for the past eight years... you've been in one foster home after another.
Mind if I ask why?
They took me away from my mother.
She's under special care.
I know that.
How come you never got settled an_here?
Adjustment problems.
I can read, Barclay.
I'm asking you.
I never felt comfortable with those people.
They weren't family.
They were strangers.
All right, listen up, Barclay.
I'm willing to cut you some slack, because you've had it rough.
But you're a troublemaker.
And I got a problem with troublemakers.
They don't fit into the system.
So here's my advice.
Grow up!
You're not a kid anymore.
It's time to forget these fantasies of killer dolls.
Yes, sir.
"When I was a child,
"I thought as a child.
"When I became a man,
I put away childish things."
First Corinthians.
Look alive.
On your feet.
At Kent, we take bed wetters and turn 'em into men.
Oh, yes.
Yes, oh.
Yes, we're seeing some skin now, aren't we?
Presto, you're bald.
Always feels weird at first.
Next.
Kiss it good-bye.
The Romans invented the military cut.
You know why?
Why?
To keep their hair short, so their enemies couldn't grab it in battle... and slit their throat.
Ha, ha, ha.
Now hold still.
Oh, shit.
Ha, ha, ha.
[Tv] We're back and we're better than ever.
No one will play with me.
Uh-oh, there's a friend in need.
[Tv] Hey, cheer up.
Who are you?
I'm a Good Guy.
[Echoing] Good Guy, Good Guy, Good Guy!
I've just come from the Good Guy clubhouse... and I'll be your friend to the end.
You will?
[Echoing] Wow.
Sure I will.
Hi-de-ho.
All aboard for high-flying fun with me, your friend to the end, the Good Guy doll from Play Pals.
[Thumping]
[Thumping]
[Thumping]
Are you okay?
Bastards!
Fucking bastards!
What happened?
Shelton!
That's what happened!
Shelton and his goddamn lackeys.
Thank you.
I'm fine.
I'm Andy.
You must be new.
Otherwise... you'd know they don't tolerate individuality, nothing as personal as a first name.
Right.
I forgot.
- Barclay.
- Whitehurst.
Harold Aubrey, for the record.
So, who's this Shelton?
Cadet lieutenant Colonel Brett C. Shelton.
He's God around here.
Don't expect mercy from him.
Welcome to hell, Barclay.
All present and accounted for, sir.
Thank you, Major Ellis.
You're new boy, huh?
Yeah.
How you doing?
Pretty good.
Who said you could look at me?
Do you know who I am?
Shelton?
That's Lieutenant Colonel Shelton to you, asshole!
[Andy] Lieutenant Colonel Shelton.
Lieutenant Colonel...
Shelton... sir.
Lieutenant Colonel Shelton, sir.
-What's your name, dipweed?
- Barclay.
- Sir.
- Louder.
- Louder!
- Sir!
That's much better, new boy.
That's much better.
Shit, Whitehurst.
You are without a doubt... the most pathetic thing I have ever seen!
Wouldn't you agree?
I asked you a question, nimrod.
No, sir!
I don't agree, sir!
Are you contradicting me, you sorry-ass sack of shit?
You asshole.
- What did you say?
- I said, "You asshole;' sir!
Think you're pretty funny, don't you, De Silva?
Yes, I do, sir.
Drop and give me 25.
Right now.
25 what, sir?
25 push-ups, De Silva.
One, sir!
Two, sir!
Three, sir!
You women might think... that because you're so much more delicate... you deserve special treatment... and once a month... we're gonna get out of your way.
You can forget it!
13, sir!
14, sir!
The same rules apply for everybody.
18, sir!
Only the fittest survive.
22,sir!
23,sir!
One-handed.
24, sir!
25... sir!
Recover.
How you doing, Tyler?
Sorry, nothing from your dad.
Maybe tomorrow.
Listen, he's busy flying jets, defending the county.
He'll write when he gets a chance.
I know.
Hey!
I got a job for you.
Give this to the new kid for me.
- Barclay.
- Yes, sir.
That a boy.
Out of the way.
Watch it, kid.
Hey!
Look out!
A Good Guy.
[Yelling]
Who the fuck are you?
I thought you guys only said three sentences.
I'm new and improved.
I never saw a doll like you before.
All right, kid.
Fun's over.
Where the hell's Andy?
Andy?
Can't you read?
He was supposed to get this package.
Tampering with the mail is a federal offense.
Sorry.
Is he your best friend?
He's more than that.
He's my new lease on life.
Wait a minute.
I got a new body... and I ain't told anyone about my little secret yet.
So, what's your name, kid?
Tyler.
What's yours?
Chucky.
But my real name... is Charles Lee Ray.
[Shooting]
Whitehurst, what am I doing wrong?
ls there anything you can't do?
Yeah.
I can't get thrown out of this place.
Barclay, meet De Silva.
Hi.
Hi.
So, you want to show me?
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
No, put the elbow like that.
And like this.
No.
Keep both eyes open.
Keep your sights on the target.
Hold your breath.
Squeeze the trigger.
Don't pull it.
[Gunshot]
You're not concentrating.
It was great what you did for us at formation.
Shelton's a major dick.
Tell me about it.
[Gunshot]
[Gunshot]
[Chucky] Hold still.
What do you call this game?
"Hide the Soul." Trust me, you're gonna love it.
Whatever you say, Charles.
Ade due...
Damballa!
Give me the power, I beg of you!
[Thundering]
Leveau mercierdu bois chaloitte... secoisse entienne mais pois de--
[Door Closing]
Shit!
[Tyler] Charles, stop swearing.
We're gonna need the Springfield aught-threes...
Yes, sir.
marked for both the red team and the blue team.
What are you doing, Tyler?
We're playing "Hide the Soul."
I'll catch up with you.
I'll start loading the paint guns.
We don't play with dolls, do we?
Dolls are for girls.
But Charles is my new best friend.
You know better than to talk back to a superior.
Yes, sir.
Clean that up.
I'll take care of this.
[Good Guy Voice] I'll be back!
Left, left Left, right, left.
Left, left.
[Shelton] Get that weapon up, Barclay.
Platoon, halt.
Left face.
New boy!
Fall out.
Fall out!
[Shelton] Order, hut.
Port... arms!
Right shoulder... arms!
Left shoulder... arms.
Right shoulder, arms.
left shoulder, arms.
[Shelton] Port arms.
[Echoing] Left shoulder, arms.
[Echoing] Port arms.
[Echoing] Right shoulder, arms.
[Echoing] Port arms.
Barclay!
It's not a baton, Barclay.
You look like a goddamn majorette over here.
I'm not used to guns, sir.
Does this look like a gun to you, Barclay?
It's a rifle.
- Major Ellis!
- Sir!
Show the new boy the difference.
This is my rifle.
This is my gun.
This is for shooting and this is for fun.
A soldier's rifle is his best friend.
Remember that.
Stop!
Shit!
[Chucky] Help!
Please, mister!
Please, somebody!
Jesus!
I'm stuck, mister!
I'm in here!
Hold on!
I'm coming!
Where are you?
I'm coming.
Yell!
Make a noise!
Where are ya?
[Gasping]
Oh, my God!
No, stop!
[Laughing]
Stop!
[Yelling]
[Screaming]
[Screaming]
[Shelton] fall out!
You get back there.
Finish unpacking.
Shelton's notorious for surprise inspections.
What are you doing?
What's it look like?
I'm polishing Shelton's shoes.
He makes you polish his shoes?
No, I offered out of the kindness of my heart.
Whitehurst, did you see Cochrane with that doll today?
No, what doll?
He was carrying a Good Guy doll... just before the accident with the garbage truck.
Good Guys.
I remember those.
Yeah, me too.
[Spitting]
Lights out in a few minutes.
I'm gonna go get washed up.
I almost forgot.
Sgt. Clarkwanted to know if you got that package.
What package?
He said you got a package in the mail.
Tyler was supposed to bring it to you.
Didn't you get it?
No.
Who would have sent me a package?
Hey, long time no see, pal!
No, you're dead!
We killed you!
You know what they say.
"You just can't keep a good guy down."
[Laughing]
Andy, how you've grown.
You're not gonna kill me.
You need to transfer your soul.
Wrong again, wimp.
I got some fresh meat lined up.
I'm not gonna let you spoil it this time.
- Tyler?
- Yeah.
Just think.
Chucky's gonna be a "bro."
I'm not gonna let you get away with this.
I'm not gonna let you near that kid.
Agh!
[Laughing]
What's the matter?
You homesick?
You miss your mommy?
What the fuck is this?
I'm sorry about your shoe.
I'll polish it.
Give me back the doll.
No, you listen to me.
Tell Whitehurst he's off the hook.
I got myself another slave.
Clean up this mess.
You got five demerits.
What about the doll?
My kid sister's birthday's coming up.
I think she's gonna Cove it, don't you?
[Closet Door Creaking]
[Whispering] Oh, shit.
Andy.
What the fuck?
No, stop!
What the fuckyou doing in my room?
You wouldn't believe me.
Where's the doll Barclay?
Where's the fucking doll?
You took it, didn't you?
No!
What's going on?
Somebody sure as hell took it.
It's almost midnight.
Is this necessary?
I'm tying to weed out a thief. sir.
You've always told me how important it is... to uphold the school's code of honor.
All right, make your point.
But I want everybody back in at 01.00 hours.
Yes, sir.
By the time we get through with Barclay, he's gonna be living in a world full of shit.
We got an hour, so let's make it count.
Yes, sir.
Ladies, get those weapons in the air.
I want to see them high.
Higher!
I think I'm gonna throw up.
You're dead, new boy.
fucking geek.
"Dear Charles, you're it.
Come and find me.
Your best friend."
Shit!
Charles.
Come and find me.
Goddamn it.
Platoon!
[Cadets] Hut.
Double time!
Hut.
Knees up, ladies.
Whitehurst, where do the kids sleep?
Above the portico.
[Ellis] You're wearing combat boots, not ballet slippers!
[Ellis] Come on, move it Barclay.
[Ellis] it's gonna get worse than this.
Get the lead out.
Come on, move it.
Faster, faster.
Get those knees in the sky.
You son of a bitch!
Hell of a punch there, Barclay.
Now I'll see what kind of a tough guy you are.
Get your head around here.
[Giggling]
Tyler, come out, come out, wherever you are.
[Chucky] Dolly dolly oxen free!
Get out here, you little son of a bitch!
[Ellis] Three!
You're not sounding of_
Four!
Five!
All right, Barclay.
You got me curious.
What are you tying to prove?
Forget it.
I want to know.
All right.
The doll's alive.
- He's after Tyler.
- Right, forget it.
I hope he can take care of himself.
Shh, shh.
Quiet.
[Gasping, Laughing]
[Whispers] Shut up!
I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
Just stay here and keep an eye out.
Oh, I live for this.
I know, Ivers.
Now go, go.
Shh, shh.
I don't see what you see in that guy.
He's just different from everybody else.
Oh, please.
Well, he's cute too.
Okay.
[De Silva] foster homes.
No wonder he's so quiet.
[Thumping]
What was that?
So, you took the doll?
Shelton will have you court-martialed.
We're playing hide-and-seek.
What are you doing?
We couldn't sleep.
Oh, he is... so cute.
He was mine first.
Give him back.
Shh, you guys.
Please be quiet!
Can you go stand guard?
Yes, sir.
What's his name?
Ask him yourself.
Oh, right.
What is your name?
[Good Guy Voice] Hi, I'm Chucky and I'm your friend to the end.
Hi-de-ho.
Ha, ha.
I love it.
His real name is Charles Lee Ray.
Oh, is that so?
Give me your lipstick.
What for?
Just give it to me.
What are you doing?
Wait, stop.
You'll see.
[De Silva] Here you go, little baby.
[Tyler] You're messing him up.
You're so cute.
Don't do that.
He looks stupid!
You're making him look like a wuss!
He looks sweet.
What are you doing?
Someone's coming.
Come on, let's go.
Come on.
Wait.
Stop!
What about Charles?
Yuck!
This means war.
What the hell?
- I like to be hugged.
- Go--Jesus!
[Chuckles]
[Crash]
Aaah!
Aw, you gotta be fucking kidding' me.
[Gasping]
The man lives through two tours in Nam... and then one night he just drops dead.
Doesn't make any sense.
## [Reveille]
[Shelton] At ease.
We will now take a moment of silence to honor Colonel Cochrane.
He was a fine man and he will be sorely missed.
Bow your heads for prayer.
[Shelton] Take... seats!
It's gettin' pretty shaggy, Carlson.
I want to see you on Friday.
Yes, sir.
Monday, Fabrizzio.
Yes, sir.
My man.
Tuesday.
Look at you, Whitehurst.
You're a disgrace.
When's the last time you had a trim?
Two weeks ago, Sergeant, I think.
You think?
I want to see you right after breakfast.
Yes, sir, Sergeant Botnick, sir.
What're you looking at, new boy?
Wednesday.
Barclay, what're you doing?
You can't just get up in the middle of mess.
Major.
At ease!
Tyler.
Hi, Barclay.
What's up?
I've got to talk to you about Chucky.
You mean Charles.
Have you seen him?
Not since last night.
He's hiding somewhere.
He's gonna lay low until he knows you're alone, and he's gonna come after you.
He wants to play.
Listen to me.
No matter what he says, no matter what he promises you, you've gotta stay away from him.
Don't let him fool you.
He's bad.
Charles isn't bad, he's a Good Guy.
It says so on his shirt.
He lies, Tyler.
Believe me, he's bad news.
He's hurt a lot of people.
I think Colonel Cochrane was one of them.
You're just jealous because he's my best friend now instead of yours.
Look, you better keep this.
Whitehurst, you are, without a doubt the sorriest excuse for a soldier to ever disgrace these walls.
Face it, you're not cut out for this life.
Why don't you do yourself a favor and get the hell out of Kent?
If I had any choice in the matter, I would, sir.
Smart ass.
Presto... you're bald.
[Whistling]
What the hell?
How'd you get in there?
That haircut ain't regulation, soldier.
When's the last time you had a trim, huh?
Kiss it good-bye.
Presto...
you're dead.
Ha,ha,ha,ha.
It's definitely you.
Ha,ha,ha,ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
I just forgot my --
Boo!
The annual war games... have been an unbroken tradition here at Kent for over 50 years.
Colonel Cochrane was a man who believed in tradition.
He not only would have wanted us to go on, he'd have ordered us to go on.
Therefore... the war games.... will proceed as scheduled.
Lieutenant Colonel Shelton... will command the blue team.
Major Rawlings will head up the reds.
The objective is simple.
To capture the other team's flag... and bring it back here safely to base.
Rawlings.
You will pick up your weapons... in the armory before moving out.
You will be using the standard issue Springfield aught-three.
Your ammo--
Shelton.
If you get hit, you are dead.
Hike back to base.
Commanders... take charge of your teams.
May the best team win.
Good luck, men and women.
Nice of you to join us.
Looks like Botnick's in a pretty bad mood today.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing's wrong.
I'm fine.
Nothing's wrong.
This oughta slow the pricks down.
[Instructor] left, left, left.
Her ewe go again.
Here we go again.
Same old stuff again.
Same old stuff again.
Marching down the avenue.
Marching down the avenue.
Two more miles and we'll be through.
Two more miles and we'll be through.
I'll be gettin' rid of you.
I'll be gettin' rid of you.
Same old ugly stum.
Same old ugly stuff.
Her ewe go again.
Her ewe go again.
Marching down the avenue.
Marching down the avenue.
One more mile and we'll be through.
One more mile and we'll be through.
I'll be gettin' rid of you.
What's going on, Whitehurst?
You saw something, didn't you?
You saw Chucky.
Don't wimp out on me!
I need your help.
That kid needs your help.
I didn't see anything.
Okay?
I didn't see anything at all.
Your left, right, your left.
Your military left.
Ellis, let's make sure all the perimeters are secure.
Yes, sir.
She checks the windows.
And the baby-sitter hears this thump, thump, thumping.
Like something's being dragged across the floor upstairs.
Suddenly she thinks, "l haven't checked on the children."
So she hurries to the top of the stairs, and when she gets there... she sees her boyfriend completely dismembered, dragging himself across the floor by his chin.
Thump, slide.
Thump, slide.
Thump, slide.
[Ives] That was gross.
Hey, you guys, I got a betters toy... and it's true.
It's about this mental institution... and it's a few miles away from here.
Hey.
Hope it wasn't something I said.
[Chuckles] No.
I'm sorry.
Where do you think the red team's camped out?
Could be any here.
Shelton'll find 'em, he always does.
By the way, you can call me Kristin.
What?
Kristin.
It's my first name.
Do you have one?
Andy.
Come on, Andy.
I want to show you something.
Pretty cool, huh?
Yeah, I almost forgot there were places like that... where people just go to have fun.
[Twig Snaps] Listen!
Somebody's out there.
It's probably just a chipmunk or something.
Nothing scares you, does it?
No.
Man, I gotta get out of this body.
I'm going after Tyler.
Are you crazy?
You'll never find him.
Wanna bet?
I swiped this from Shelton's tent.
He sent out a reconnaissance mission right before we pitched camp.
The red team is somewhere around here.
That kid's a sitting duck, Whitehurst.
Are you with me... or not?
I'm sorry, I can't.
[Ellis] Up and at 'em, ladies.
We're movin' out.
I want this camp to be a ghost town in five minutes.
I thought we weren't going till dawn, sir.
Someone stole the reconnaissance map, so we're making Our Move now.
Get going, Hanley.
You wouldn't know anything about a missing map, would you?
Where the hell's Barclay?
Whitehurst!
Colonel Shelton, you better have a look in here, sir.
What is it, Ellis?
Barclay's gone AWOL, sir.
He stole the map.
That little fucking traitor's doubling for the reds.
Where's Tyler?
He went AWOL with some guy named Charles.
Where's Andy?
Whitehurst, where is he?
[Shelton] Platoon, halt!
All right.
De Silva, you're gonna take the right flank.
Siegel, take the left.
Check in on the radio every five minutes.
Yes, sir.
All right, move it.
The rest of us are gonna spread out and meet up with Ellis at Split Rock.
Move out.
Whitehurst, move!
Thanks for coming after me.
What are friends for?
Duck!
That was a close one.
Now we can play "Hide the Soul."
I'm tired.
I don't wanna play that dumb game anymore.
You're a fuckin' drag, you know that?
- Watch your mouth, Charles.
- Stop calling me that!
What's the knife for?
A good soldier is always prepared.
Barclay w_s right.
You're not a good guy.
Sorry kid.
You got me.
I'm bad.
Now... assume the position.
No!
Aaah!
Get back here!
Barclay!
Barclay!
Tyler!
You fuckin' traitor.
Give me my map!
Listen -
- You got any idea what we do to traitors, Barclay?
Tyler's in trouble.
Whitehurst, back me up.
Major Ellis, call in the flanks.
Yes, sir.
De Silva, Siegel, do you copy?
De Silva, do you copy?
[Radio] De Silva, come in.
Aaah!
Siegel's on his way back.
No word yet from De Silva.
Keep trying'.
Yes, sir.
Help!
Tyler!
Barclay!
Are you okay, Tyler?
Looks like we got ourselves a little P.O.W. You're right,
Charles is bad.
He tried to hurt me.
Who the hell's Charles?
[Chucky] Come in, Barclay.
Who the hell is that?
It's Charles.
Who is this?
Put Barclay on, jarhead.
[Ellis] It's the reds.
They're up to something.
What do you want?
I want the kid.
Bring him up to the old Jeep or there'll be hell to pay.
[De Silva] Andy, don't do it.
De Silva!
You hear that, Barclay?
Don't touch her, you son of a bitch.
Now bring me the kid or I'll waste her.
Red team, red team.
come in, red team.
This is red team, over.
We got a situation up here at the old Jeep.
Blue team sighted.
Advise you to move your troops in.
Hope they like the taste of lead.
Now just sit back and watch the sparks fly.
All right, you two are gonna go on up ahead.
The rest of us are gonna circle around.
Shelton, this is no game.
This guy is dangerous.
Relax, Barclay, it's only paint.
All right, let's do it.
I'm scared, Barclay.
Yeah, me too.
All right, kid.
Get over here!
No!
Don't fuckwith me!
I'll blow all of you to pieces.
Beat it!
Now just get down and shut up.
Yeah!
Ow!
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
De Silva, where the hell is everybody?
Hi, soldier.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

You did this, didn't you?
You sick son of a bitch.
Now I'm gonna kill you!
Get off me!
Get off of him, he didn't do it!
Let go of me!
Savonarola, suckers.
Look out!
No!
Oh, my God, what happened?
[Ellis] It's Whitehurst.
What the hell happened?
Who fucked with the rifles?
I don't know.
[Ellis] Get Clark on the radio...
Yes, sir.

[Ellis] All right, everybody stay calm.
Epstein, I want that radio!
Oh, God.
[loud Rock Music] This is the last time I'm gonna tell you.
Give that thing a rest or you're out of here, both of you.
We're not bothering anybody.
You're bothering me.
Keep it down!
Geez!
Mister, you gotta help me!
What's wrong?
Charles, Charles he's after me.
Who's Charles?
He's a Good Guy.
He wants to play "Hide the Soul."
Have a seat over there.
Are you from Kent?
Yes, sir.
What's your name, son?
Ronald Tyler.
Private first class, sir.
Have a seat.
How 'bout some gum, Private?
I know how it must hurt... when a friend does something bad to you.
Sure does.
But I bet your friend -- what's his name, Charles?
I bet you Charles didn't mean it.
I bet you he's really sorry.
No, he isn't.
He wants to hurt me.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
I know what'll cheer you up.
Look what I found.
There you go.
Thank you, Daddy.
Let's go on the Super Loop.
Hey, maybe somebody's seen him.
Oh, God.
Come on.
Wait.
Mommy, Mommy, I loved it!
Were you scared?

[ Screaming ]
This is Andy Barclay.
Eight years ago he touch off the scandal... that nearly crippled, this copany, claiming that his Good Guydoll, Chucky, was possessed by...
Charles Lee Ray, the notorious Lakeshore Strangler.
Now I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, after the lawsuits and negative publicity, when the company is finally getting back on its feet, where is the wisdom in putting the Good Guy back on the market?
Mr. Sullivan, before this happened... the Good Guy outsold our other toys 2 to 1 .
Even now, interest in the marketplace is at its peak.
The factoy is up and running again.
We should be in stores by next week.
We cannot let the fantasies ofone disturbed boy... influence company policy.
What if the doll somehow... affects anotherchild in a negative way?
You could have a public relations nightmare.
One ofthe hardest things about this business is... that it is a business
Doesn't matter what we're selling.
Whether it's cars nuclear weapons... or yes, even toys.
The bottom line is the bottom line
And what are children but consummer tranees?
Andy Barclay is ancient histoy.
No one remembers him.
Nobody cares.
I have made up my mind.
We're moving ahead.
Thank you.
Okay.
Al l right.
Mr. Sullivan.
If there's nothing I can say to convince you, then I must go on record.
I'm completely against this.
Your position is cystal clear, Miles.
And you can be sure I won't forget.
Just a minute, folks.
Mr. Sullivan, we have a surprise.
Guys at the factoy sent this over.
First offthe assembly line, the Good Guy of the '90s.
[ Clapping ]
If there's nothing else, I'm gonna get going.
Fine.
it's just, my wife's expecting me.
It's our anniversay.
Fine, Petzold.
I could review the Larrabee report after dinner.
Good night, Mr. Sullivan.
Good night.
[ Elevator Bell Dings ]
Ahh_
Despite a downdraft in the bond market, stocks were able to post a rally on friday... thanks to a couple of different factors.
Not only did the employment report allay recession fears, but also there was a technical rebound in buying... and a resurgence in deal stocks helped set the tone.
Here's a look at the numbers.
The Dow industrial's up 16.
The transportation average up 3.
Utilities bouncing up--
Utilities bouncing up--
In a moment's time --
Oh, shit.
[Tv] Bonds headed south on the economic data, which served to bolster the U.S. dollar.
The dollar index up a quarter point.
The CRB index up... point 43 at two-thirty point 43.

,Left, left left, left.
I see for the past eight years... you've been in one foster home after another.
Mind if I ask why?
They took me away from my mother.
She's under special care.
I knnw that.
How come you never got settled anywhere?
Adiustment problems.
I can read, Barclay.
I'm asking you.
I never felt comfortable with those people.
They weren't family.
They were strangers.
All right, listen up, Barclay.
I'm willing to cutyou some slack, because you've had it rough.
But you're a troublemaker.
And I got a problem with troublemaker.
They don't fit into the system.
So here's my advice.
Grow up!
You're not a kid anymore.
It's time to forget these fantasies of killer dolls.
Yes, sir.
"When I was a child,
"l thought as a child.
"When I became a man, I put away childish things."

Oh, yes.

Yes, we're seeing some skin now, aren't we?
Presto, you're bald.
Always feels weird at first.
Next.
Kiss it good-bye.
The Romans invented the militay cut.
You know why?
Why?
To keep their hair short, so their enemies couldn't grab it in battle... and slit their throat.
Ha, ha, ha.
Now hold still.
Oh, shit.
Ha, ha, ha.
[Tv] We're back and we're better than ever.
No one will play with me.
Uh-oh, there's a friend indeed
[Tv] Hey, cheer up.
Who are you?
I'm a Good Guy.
[ Echoing ] Good Guy, Good Guy, Good Guy!
I've just come from the Good Guy clubhouse... and I'll be your friend to the end.
You will?

Sure I will.
Hi-de-ho.
All aboard for high-flying fun with me, your friend to the end, the Good Guydoll from Play Pals.

Right. I forgot.

Harold Aubrey, for the record.
So, who's this Shelton?
Cadet lieutenant Colonel Brett C. Shelton.
He's God around here
Don't expect mercy from him.
Welcome to hell, Barclay.
All present and accounted for, sir.
Thank you, Major Ellis.
You're new boy, huh?
Yeah.
How you doing?

Shit, Whitehurst.
You are without a doubt... the most pathetic thing I have ever seen!
Wouldn't you agree?
I asked you a question, nimrod.
No, sir!
I don't agree, sir!
Areyou contradicting me, you sory-ass sack of shit?
You asshole.

Think you're pretty funny, don't you, De Silva?
Yes, I do, sir.

Tampering with the mail is a federal offense.
Sorry.

He's more than that.
He's my new lease on life
Wait a minute.

So, what's your name, kid?
Tyler.

Chucky.
But my real name... is Charles Lee Ray.

What am I doing wrong?

I can't get thrown out ofthis place.

Yeah, sure.

It's a rifle.
- Major Ellis!
- Sir!
Show the new boy the difference.
This is my rifle.
This is my gun.
This is for shooting and this is for fun.
A soldier's rifle is his best friend.

I'm polishing Shelton shoes.
He makes you polish his shoes?
No, I offered out ofthe kindness of my heart.
Whitehurst, did you see Cochrane with that doll today?
No, what doll?
He was carying a Good Guy doll... lust before the accident with the garbage truck.
Good Guys.
I remember those.
Yeah, me too.
[ Spitting ]

I'm gonna go get washed up.
I almost forgot.
Sgt. Clarkwanted to know ifyou got that package.
What package?
He said you got a package in the mail.
Tylerwas supposed to bring it toyou.
Didn't you get it?
No.
Who would have sent me a package?
Hey, long time no see, pal!
No, you're dead!
We killed you!
You know what they say.
"Youjust can't keep a good guy down."
[ Laughing ]
Andy, how you've grown.
You're not gonna kill me.
You need to transfer your soul.
Wrong again, wimp.
I got some fresh meat lined up.
I'm not gonna let you spoil it this time.
- Tyler?
- Yeah.
Just think.
Chucky's gonna be a "bro."
I'm not gonna let you get away with this.
I'm not gonna let you near that kid.
Agh!

What's the matter?
You home sick?
You miss your mommy?
What the fuck is this?
I'm sorry about your shoe.
I'll polish it.
Give me back the doll.

Tell Whitehurst he's off the hook.
I got myself another slave.

I'm tying to weed out a thief. sir.
You've always told me how important it is... to uphold the school's code of honor.
All right, make your point.
But I want eveybody back in at 01:00 hours.
Yes, sir.
By the time we get through with Barclay, he's gonna be living in the world full mof shit.
We got an hour, so let's make it count.

I hope he can take care of him self.
Shh, shh.

Just stay here and keep an eye out.
Oh, I live for this.

He's just different from eveybody else.
Oh, please.
Well, he's cute too.
Okay.

No wonder he's so quiet.
[Thumping ]
What was that?
So, you took the doll?
Shelton will have you court-martialed.
We're playing hide-and-seek.
What are you doing?
We couldn't sleep.
Oh, he is... so cute.
He was mine first.
Give him back.
Shh, you guys.
Please be quiet!
Can you go stand guard?
Yes, sir.
What's his name?
Ask him yourself.
Oh, right.
What is your name?
[ Good GuyVoice ] Hi, I'm Chucky and I'm your friend to the end.
Hi-de-ho.

Give me your lipstick.
What for?
Just give it to me.
What areyou doing?
Wait, stop.
You'll see.
[ De Silva ] Here you go, little baby.

You're so cute.
Don't do that.
He looks stupid!
You're making him look like a wuss!
He looks sweet.
What are you doing?
Someone's coming.
Come on, let's go.

Doesn't make any sense.

We will now take a moment of silence to honor Colonel Cochrane.
He was a fine man and he will be sorely missed.
Bowyour heads for prayer.

I want to seeyou on Friday.

You're a disgrace.
When's the last time you had a trim?

Ynll think?
I want to seeyou right after breakfast.
Yes, sir, Sergeant Botnick, sir.
What'reyou looking at, new boy?

Barclay, what're you doi ng?
You can't just get up in the middle of mess.
Major.
At ease!
Tyler.
H i, Barclay.
What's up?
I've got to talk to you about Chucky.
You mean Charles.
Have you seen him?
Not since last night.
He's hiding somewhere.
He's gonna lay low until he knows you're alone, and he's gonna come after you.
He wants to play.
Listen to me.
No matter what he says, no matter what he promises you, you've gotta stay away from him.
Don't let him fool you.
He's bad.
Charles isn't bad, he's a Good Guy.
It says so on his shirt.
He lies, Tyler.
Believe me, he's bad news.
He's hurt a lot of people.
I think colonel Cochrane was one of them.
You're just jealous because he's my best friend now instead of yours.
Look, you better keep this.
Whitehurst, you are, without a doubt the sorriest excuse for a soldier to ever disgrace these walls.
Face it, you're not cut out for this life.
Why don't you do yourself a favor and get the hell out of Kent?
If I had any choice in the matter, I would, sir.
Smart ass.
Presto... you're bald.
[ Whistling ]
What the hell?
How'd you get in there?

Ha,ha,ha,ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
I just forgot my --
Boo!
The annual war games... have been an unbroken tradition here at Kent for over 50 years.
Colonel Cochrane was a man who believe in tradition.
He not only would have wanted us to go on,
He'd have ordered us to go on.
Therefore...
The war games.... will proceed as scheduled.
Lieutenant Colonel Shelton..
will command the blue team.
Major Rawlings will head up the reds.
The obiective is simple.
To capture the other team's flag... and bring it back here safely to base.
Rawlings.
You will pick up your weapons... in the armoy before moving out.
You will be using the standard issue Springfield aught-three.
Your ammo--
Shelton.
If you get hit, you are dead.
Hike back to base.
Commanders..
take charge of your teams.
May the best team win.
Good luck, men and women.
Nice of you to join us.
Looks like Botnick's in a pretty bad mood today.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing's wrong.
I'm fine.
Nothing's wrong.
This oughta slow the pricks down.

You saw something, didn't you?
You saw Chucky.
Don't wimp out on me!
I need your help.
That kid needs your help.
I didn't see anything.
Okay?
I didn't see anything at all.
Your left, right, your left.
Your militay left.
Ellis, let's make sure all the perimeters are secure.
Yes, sir.
She checks the windows.
And the baby-sitter hears this thump, thump, thumping.
Like something's being dragged across the floor upstairs.
Suddenly she thinks, "l haven't checed on the children"
So she hurries to the top of the stairs, and when she gets there... she sees her boyfriend completely dismembered, dragging himself across the floor by his chin.
Thump, slide.
Thump, slide.
Thump, slide.
[ Ivers ] That was gross.
****
Hey, you guys, I got a better story... and it's true.
It's about this mental institution... and it's a few miles away from here.
Hey.
Hope it wasn't something I said.
[ Chuckles ] No. I'm sory.
Where doyou think the red team's camped out?
Could be anywhere.
Shelton'll find 'em, he always does.
By the way, you can call me Kristin.
What?
Kristin.
It's my first name.
Do you have one?
Andy.
Come on, Andy.
I want to show you something.
Pretty cool, huh?
Yeah, I almost forgot there were places like that... where peoplejust go to have fun.
[Twig Snaps ] listen!
Somebody's out there.
It's probably just a chipmunk or something.
Nothing scares you, does it?
No.
Man, I really got to get out of this body.
I'm going afterTyler.
Are you crazy?
You'll never find him.
Wanna bet?
I swiped this from Shelton's tent.
He sent out a reconnaissance mission right before we pitched camp.
The red team is somewhere around here.
That kid's a sitting duck, Whitehurst.
Are you with me... nr nnt?
I'm sory, I can't.
[ Ellis ] Up and at 'em, ladies.
We're movin' out.
I want this camp to be a ghost town in five minutes.
I thought we weren't going till dawn, sir.
Someone stole the reconnaissance map, so we're making our move now.
Get going, Hanley.
You wouldn't know anything about a missing map, would you?
Where the hell's Barclay?
Whitehurst!
Colonel Shelton, you better have a look in here, sir.
What is it, Ellis?
Barclay's gone AWOL, sir.
He stole the map.
That little fucking traitor's doubling for the reds.
Where's Tyler?
He went AWOL with some guy named Charles.
Where's Andy?
Whitehurst, where is he?
[ Shelton ] Platoon, halt!
All right.
De Silva, you're gonna take the right flank.
Siegel, take the left.
Check in on the radio evey five minutes.
Yes, sir.

The rest ofus are gonna spread out and meet up with Ellis at Split Rock.
Move out.
Whitehurst, move!
Thanks for coming after me.
What are friend for?
Duck!
That was a close one.
Now we can play "Hide the soul"
I'm tired. I don't wanna play that dumb game anymore.
You're a fuckin' drag, you know that?
- Watch your mouth, Charles.
- Stop calling me that!
What's the knife for?
A good soldier is always prepared.
Barclay was right.
You're not a good guy.
Sorry kid.
You got me.
I'm bad
Now..

No!
Aaah!
Get abck here!

Tyler's in trouble.
Whitehurst, back me up.
Major Ellis, call in the flanks.
Yes, sir.
De Silva, Siegel, do you copy?
De Silva, do you copy?
[ Radio ] De Silva, come in.
Aaah!
Siegel's on his way back.
No word yet from De Silva.
Keep tryin'.
Yes, sir.
Help!

Barclay!
Are you okay, Tyler?
Looks like we got ourselves a little P.O.W. You're right,
Charles is bad.
He tried to hurt me.
Who the hell Charles?
[ Chucky] Come in, Barclay.
Who the hell that?
It's Charles.
Who is this?
Put Barclay on, jarhead.
[ Ellis ] It's the reds.
They're up to something.
What do you want?
I want the kid.
Bring him up to the old Jeep or there'll be hell to pay.
[ De Silva ] Andy, don't do it.
De Silva!
You hear that, Barclay?
Don't touch her, you son of a bitch.
Now bring me the kid or I'll waste her.
Red team, red team.

This is red team, over.
We got a situation up here at the old Jeep.
Blue team sighted.
Advise you to move your troops in.
Hope they like the taste of lead.
Now just sit back and watch the sparks fly.
All right, you two are gonna go on up ahead.
The rest ofus are gonna circle around.
Shelton, this is no game.
This guy is dangerous.
Relax, Barclay, it's only paint.
All right, All right let's do it.
I'm scared, Barclay.
Yeah, me too.
All right, kid.
Get over here!
No!
Don't fuck with me!

Sure does.
But I bet your friend -- what's his name, Charles?
I bet you Charles didn't mean it.
I bet you he's really sorry.
No, he isn't.
He wants to hurt me.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
I know what'll cheer you up.
Look what I found.

This is Andy Barclay.
Eight years ago he touch off the scandal... that nearly crippled, this copany, claiming that his Good Guydoll, Chucky, was possessed by...
Charles Lee Ray, the notorious Lakeshore Strangler.
Now I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, after the lawsuits and negative publicity, when the company is finally getting back on its feet, where is the wisdom in putting the Good Guy
Mr. Sullivan, before this happened... the Good Guy outsold our other toys 2 to 1 .
Even now, interest in the marketplace is at its peak.
The factoy is up and running again.
We should be in stores by next week.
We cannot let the fantasies ofone disturbed boy... influence company policy.
What if the doll somehow... affects anotherchild in a negative way?
You could have a public relations nightmare.
One ofthe hardest things about this business is... that it is a business
Doesn't matter what we're selling.
Whether it's cars nuclear weapons... or yes, even toys.
The bottom line is the bottom line
And what are children but consummer tranees?
Andy Barclay is ancient histoy.
No one remembers him.
Nobody cares.
I have made up my mind.
We're moving ahead.
Thank you.
Okay.
Al l right.
Mr. Sullivan.
If there's nothing I can say to convince you, then I must go on record.
I'm completely against this.
Your position is cystal clear, Miles.
And you can be sure I won't forget.
Just a minute, folks.
Mr. Sullivan, we have a surprise.
Guys at the factoy sent this over.
First offthe assembly line, the Good Guy of the '90s.
If there's nothing else, I'm gonna get going.
Fine.
it's just, my wife's expecting me.
It's our anniversay.
Fine, Petzold.
I could review the Larrabee report after dinner.
Good night, Mr. Sullivan.
Good night.
Ahh_
Despite a downdraft in the bond market, stocks were able to post a rally on friday... thanks to a couple of different factors.
Not only did the employment report allay recession fears, but also there was a technical rebound in buying... and a resurgence in deal stocks helped set the tone.
Here's a look at the numbers.
The Dow industrial's up 16.
The transportation average up 3.
Utilities bouncing up--

,Left, left left, left.
I see for the past eight years... you've been in one foster home after another.
Mind if I ask why?
They took me away
She's under special care.
I knnw that.
How come you never got settled anywhere?
Adiustment problems.
I can read, Barclay.
I'm asking you.
I never felt comfortable with those people.
They weren't family.
They were strangers.
All right, listen up, Barclay.
I'm willing to cutyou some slack, because you've had it rough.
But you're a troublemaker.
And I got a problem with troublemaker.
They don't fit into the system.
So here's my advice.
Grow up!
You're not a kid anymore.
It's time to forget these fantasies of killer dolls.
Yes, sir.
"When I was a child,
"l thought as a child.
"When I became a man, I put away childish things."

Always feels weird at first.

Kiss it good-bye.
The Romans invented the militay cut.
You know why?
Why?
To keep their hair short, so their enemies couldn't grab it in battle... and slit their throat.
Ha, ha, ha.
Now hold still.
Oh, shit.
Ha, ha, ha.
We're back and we're better than ever.
No one will play with me.

Bastards!
Fucking bastards!
What happened?

Shelton and his goddamn lackeys.

Right. I forgot.

You're making him look like a wuss!
He looks sweet.
What are you doing?
Someone's coming.
Come on, let's go.
Come on.
Wait.
Stop!
Yuck!
This means war.
What the hell?
- l like to be hugged.
- Go--Jesus!
Aaah!
Aw, you gotta be fucking kidding' me.
The man lives through two tours in Nam... and then one night he just drops dead.
Doesn't make any sense.
At ease.
We will now take a moment of silence to honor Colonel Cochrane.
He was a fine man and he will be sorely missed.
Bowyour heads for prayer.
Take...seats!
It's gettin' pretty shaggy, Carlson.
I want to seeyou on Friday.
Monday, Fabrizzio.
Yes, sir.
My man.
Tuesday.
Look atyou, Whitehurst.
You're a disgrace.
When's the last time you had a trim?
Two weeks ago, Sergeant, I think.
I want to seeyou right after breakfast.
Yes, sir, Sergeant Botnick, sir.
What'reyou looking at, new boy?
Wednesday.
Barclay, what're you doi ng?
You can't just get up in the middle of mess.
Major.
At ease!
Tyler.
H i, Barclay.
What's up?
I've got to talk to you about Chucky.
Have you seen him?
Not since last night.
He's hiding somewhere.
He's gonna lay low until he knows you're alone, and he's gonna come after you.
He wants to play.
Listen to me.
No matter what he says, no matter what he promises you, you've gotta stay away from him.
Don't let him fool you.
He's bad.
Charles isn't bad, he's a Good Guy.
It says so on his shirt.
He lies, Tyler.
He's hurt a lot of people.
I think colonel Cochrane was one of them.
You're just jealous because he's my best friend now instead of yours.
Look, you better keep this.
Whitehurst, you are, without a doubt the sorriest excuse for a soldier to ever
Face it, you're not cut out for this life.
Why don't you do yourself a favor and get lf l had any choice in the matter, I would, sir.
Smart ass.
Presto... you're bald.
What the hell?
How'd you get in there?
That haircut ain't regulation, soldier.
When's the last time you had a trim, huh?
Kiss it good-bye.
Presto...
you're dead.
Ha,ha,ha,ha.
It's definitelyyou.
Ha,ha,ha,ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
I just forgot my --
Boo!
The annual war games... have been an unbroken tradition here at Kent for over 50 years.
Colonel Cochrane was a man who believe in tradition.
He not only would have wanted us to go on,
He'd have ordered us to go on.
Therefore...
The war games.... will proceed as scheduled.
Lieutenant Colonel Shelton..
will command the blue team.
Major Rawlings will head up the reds.
The obiective is simple.
To capture the other team's flag... and bring it back here safely to base.
Rawlings.
You will pick up your weapons... in the armoy before moving out.
You will be using the standard issue Springfield aught-three.
Your ammo--
Shelton.
If you get hit, you are dead.
Hike back to base.
Commanders..
take charge of your teams.
May the best team win.
Good luck, men and women.
Nice of you to join us.
Looks like Botnick's in a pretty bad mood today.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing's wrong.
I'm fine.
Nothing's wrong.
This oughta slow the pricks down.
Left, left, left.
Here we goagain.
Here we go again.
Same old stuffagain.
Same old stuffagain.
Marching down the avenue.
Marching down the avenue.
Two more miles and we'll be through.
Two more miles and we'll be through.
I'll be gettin' rid of you.

Same old ugly stum.
Same old ugly stuff.
Here we go again.
Herewe go again.
Marching down the avenue.
Marching down the avenue.
One more mile and we'll be through.
One more mile and we'll be through.
I'll be gettin' rid of you.
What's going on, Whitehurst?
You saw something, didn't you?
You saw Chucky.
Don't wimp out on me!
I need your help.
That kid needs your help.
Okay?
I didn't see anything at all.
Your left, right, your left.
Your militay left.
Ellis, let's make sure all the perimeters are secure.
She checks the windows.
And the baby-sitter hears this thump, thump, thumping.
Like something's being dragged across the floor upstairs.
Suddenly she thinks, "l haven't checed on the children"
So she hurries to the top of the stairs, and when she gets there... she sees her boyfriend completely dismembered, dragging himself across the floor by his chin.
Thump, slide.
Thump, slide.
Thump, slide.
Hey, you guys, I got a better story... and it's true.
It's about this mental institution... and it's a few miles away from here.
Hey.
Hope it wasn't something I said.
No. I'm sory.
Where doyou think the red team's camped out?
Could be anywhere.
Shelton'll find 'em, he always does.
By the way, you can call me Kristin.
What?
Kristin.
It's my first name.
Do you have one?
Andy.
Come on, Andy.
I want to show you something.
Pretty cool, huh?
Yeah, I almost forgot there were places like that... where peoplejust go to have fun.
listen!
Somebody's out there.
It's probably just a chipmunk or something.
Nothing scares you, does it?
No.
Man, I really got to get out of this body.
I'm going afterTyler.
Are you crazy?
You'll never find him.
Wanna bet?
I swiped this from Shelton's tent.
He sent out a reconnaissance mission right before we pitched camp.
The red team is somewhere around here.
That kid's a sitting duck, Whitehurst.
Are you with me... or not?
I'm sory, I can't.
Up and at 'em, ladies.
We're movin' out.
I want this camp to be a ghost town in five minutes.
I thought we weren't going till dawn, sir.
Someone stole the reconnaissance map, so we're making our move now.
Get going, Hanley.
You wouldn't know anything about a missing map, would you?
Where the hell's Barclay?
Whitehurst!
Colonel Shelton, you better have a look in here, sir.
What is it, Ellis?
Barclay's gone AWOL, sir.
He stole the map.
That little fucking traitor's doubling for the reds.
Where's Tyler?
He went AWOL with
Where's Andy?
Whitehurst, where is he?
Platoon, halt!
All right.
De Silva, you're gonna take the right flank.
Siegel, take the left.
Check in on the radio
Yes, sir.
All right, move it.
The rest ofus are gonna spread out and meet up
Move out.
Whitehurst, move!
Thanks for coming after me.
What are friend for?
Duck!
That was a close one.
Now we can play "Hide the soul"
I'm tired. I don't wanna play that dumb game anymore.
You're a fuckin' drag, you know that?
- Watch your mouth, Charles.
- Stop calling me that!
What's the knife for?
A good soldier is always prepared.
Barclay was right.
You're not a good guy.
Sorry kid.
You got me.
I'm bad
Now..

No!
Aaah!
Get back here!
Barclay!

Whitehurst, back me up.

De Silva, come in.
Aaah!
Siegel's on his way back.
No word yet from De Silva.
Keep tryin'.
Yes, sir.
Help!

Barclay!
Are you okay,
Looks like we got ourselves a little P.O.W.
Charles is bad.
He tried to hurt me.
Who the hell Charles?
Come in, Barclay.
It's Charles.
Who is this?
Put Barclay on,
It's the reds.
They're up to something.
What do you want?
I want the kid.
Bring him up to the old Jeep or there'll be hell to pay.
Andy, don't do it.
You hear that, Barclay?
Don't touch her,
Now bring me the kid or I'll waste her.
Red team, red team.
come in, red team.
This is red team, over.
We got a situation up
Blue team sighted.
Advise you to move your troops in.
Hope they like the taste of lead.
Now just sit back and watch the sparks fly.
All right, you two are gonna go on up ahead.
The rest ofus are gonna circle around.
Shelton, this is no game.
This guy is dangerous.
Relax, Barclay, it's only paint.
All right, All right let's do it.
I'm scared, Barclay.
Yeah, me too.
All right, kid.
Get over here!
No!
Don't fuck with me!
I'll blow all of you to pieces.
Beat it!
Now just get down and shut up.
Yeah!
Ow!
Hold your fire!

De Silva, where the hell is eveybody?

What the hell happened?
Who fucked with the rifles?
Get Clark on the radio... and get me a medic up here right now!
All right, eveybody stay calm.
Epstein, I want that radio!
Oh, God.
This is the last time I'm gonna tell you
Give that thing a rest or you're out of here, both of you.
We're not bothering anybody.
You're bothering me.
Geez!
Mister, you gotta help me!
What's wrong?
Charles, Charles
Who's Charles?
He's a Good Guy.
Have a seat over there.
Are you from Kent?
What's your name, son?
Ronald Tyler.
Private first class, sir.
Have a seat.
How 'bout some gum, Private?
I know how it must hurt... when a friend does something bad to you.
Sure does.
But I bet your friend -- what's his name, Charles?
I bet you Charles didn't mean it.
I bet you he's really sorry.
No, he isn't.
He wants to hurt me.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
I know what'll cheer you up.
Look what I found.
There you go.
Thank you, Daddy.
Let's go on the Super Loop.
Hey, maybe somebody's seen him.
Oh, God.
Come on.
Wait.
Mommy, Mommy, I love it!

You'll have to come with us now, son.
This is Andy Barclay.
Eight years ago he touch off the scandal... that nearly crippled, this copany, claiming that his Good Guydoll, Chucky, was possessed by...
Charles Lee Ray, the notorious Lakeshore Strangler.
Now I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, after the lawsuits and negative publicity, when the company is finally getting back on its feet, where is the wisdom in putting the Good Guy
Mr. Sullivan, before this happened... the Good Guy outsold our other toys 2 to 1 .
Even now, interest in the marketplace is at its peak.
The factoy is up and running again.
We should be in stores by next week.
We cannot let the fantasies ofone disturbed boy... influence company policy.
What if the doll somehow... affects anotherchild in a negative way?
You could have a public relations nightmare.
One ofthe hardest things about this business is... that it is a business
Doesn't matter what we're selling.
Whether it's cars nuclear weapons... or yes, even toys.
The bottom line is the bottom line
And what are children but consummer tranees?
Andy Barclay is ancient histoy.
No one remembers him.
Nobody cares.
I have made up my mind.
We're moving ahead.
Thank you.
Okay.
Al l right.
Mr. Sullivan.
If there's nothing I can say to convince you, then I must go on record.
I'm completely against this.
Your position is cystal clear, Miles.
And you can be sure I won't forget.
Just a minute, folks.
Mr. Sullivan, we have a surprise.
Guys at the factoy sent this over.
First offthe assembly line, the Good Guy of the '90s.
If there's nothing else, I'm gonna get going.
Fine.
it's just, my wife's expecting me.
It's our anniversay.
Fine, Petzold.
I could review the Larrabee report after dinner.
Good night, Mr. Sullivan.
Good night.
Ahh_
Despite a downdraft in the bond market, stocks were able to post a rally on friday... thanks to a couple of different factors.
Not only did the employment report allay recession fears, but also there was a technical rebound in buying... and a resurgence in deal stocks helped set the tone.
Here's a look at the numbers.
The Dow industrial's up 16.
The transportation average up 3.
Utilities bouncing up--
Utilities bouncing up--
In a moment's time --
Oh, shit.
Bonds headed south on the economic data, which served to bolster the U.S. dollar.
The dollar index up a quarter point.

Come on, come on.
Yeah, you can do it.
You can do it, Jackson, hurry up.
Come on, let's go.
Yeah, come on.
Get moving.

,Left, left left, left.
I see for the past eight years... you've been in one foster home after another.
Mind if I ask why?
They took me away
She's under special care.
I knnw that.
How come you never got settled anywhere?
Adiustment problems.
I can read, Barclay.
I'm asking you.
I never felt comfortable with those people.
They weren't family.
They were strangers.
All right, listen up, Barclay.
I'm willing to cutyou some slack, because you've had it rough.
But you're a troublemaker.
And I got a problem with troublemaker.
They don't fit into the system.
So here's my advice.
Grow up!
You're not a kid anymore.
It's time to forget these fantasies of killer dolls.
Yes, sir.
"When I was a child,
"l thought as a child.
"When I became a man, I put away childish things."
First Conrinthians.
Look alive.
On your feet.
At Kent, we take bed wetters and
Oh, yes.
Yes, oh.
Yes, we're seeing some skin now, aren't we?
Presto, you're bald.
Always feels weird at first.
Next.
Kiss it good-bye.
The Romans invented the militay cut.
You know why?
Why?
To keep their hair short, so their enemies couldn't grab it in battle... and slit their throat.
Ha, ha, ha.
Now hold still.
Oh, shit.
Ha, ha, ha.
We're back and we're better than ever.
No one will play with me.
Uh-oh, there's a friend indeed
Hey, cheer up.
Who are you?
I'm a Good Guy.
Good Guy, Good Guy, Good Guy!
I've just come from the Good Guy clubhouse... and I'll be your friend to the end.
You will?
[ Echoing ] Wow.

Hi-de-ho.
All aboard for high-flying fun with me, your friend to the end, the Good Guydoll from Play Pals.
Are you okay?
Bastards!
Fucking bastards!
What happened?
Shelton!
Shelton and his goddamn lackeys.
Thankyou.
I'm fine I'm Andy.
You must be new.
Otherwise... you'd know they don't tolerate individuality, nothing as personal as the first name.
Right. I forgot.

I asked you a question, nimrod.
No, sir!
I don't agree, sir!
Areyou contradicting me, you sory-ass sack of shit?

I can't get thrown out ofthis place.
Barclay, meet De Silva.
Hi.
So, you want to show me?
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
No, put the elbow like that.
And like this.
No.
Keep both eyes open.
Keepyour sights on the target.
Hold your breath.
Squeeze the trigger.
Don't pull it.
You're not concentrating.
It was great what you did for us at formation.
Shelton's a maior dick.

Does this look like a gun to you, Barclay?
It's a rifle.
- Major Ellis!
- Sir!
Show the new boy the difference.
This is my rifle.
This is my gun.
This is for shooting and this is for fun.
A soldier's rifle is his best friend.

I hope he can take care of him self.
Shh, shh.
Quiet.
Shut up!
I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
Just stay here and keep an eye out.
Oh, I live for this.
I know, Ivers.
Now go, go.
Shh, shh.
I don't see what you see in that guy.
He's just different from eveybody else.
Oh, please.
Well, he's cute too.
Okay.
forster homes.
No wonder he's so quiet.
What was that?
So, you took the doll?
Shelton will have you court-martialed.
We're playing hide-and-seek.
We couldn't sleep.
Oh, he is... so cute.
He was mine first.
Give him back.
Shh, you guys.
Please be quiet!
Can you go stand guard?
What's his name?
Ask him yourself.
Oh, right.
What is your name?
Hi, I'm Chucky and I'm
Hi-de-ho.
Ha, ha.
I love it.
His real name is Charles Lee Ray.
Oh, is that so?
Give me your lipstick.
What for?
Just give it to me.
What areyou doing?
Wait, stop.
Here you go, little baby.
You're messing him up.
Don't do that.
He looks stupid!
You're making him look like a wuss!
He looks sweet.
What are you doing?
Someone's coming.
Come on, let's go.
Come on.
Wait.
Stop!
Yuck!
This means war.
What the hell?
- l like to be hugged.
- Go--Jesus!
Aaah!
Aw, you gotta be fucking kidding' me.
The man lives through two tours in Nam... and then one night he just drops dead.
Doesn't make any sense.
At ease.
We will now take a moment of silence to honor Colonel Cochrane.
He was a fine man and he will be sorely missed.
Bowyour heads for prayer.
Take...seats!
It's gettin' pretty shaggy, Carlson.
I want to seeyou on Friday.
Monday, Fabrizzio.
Yes, sir.
My man.
Tuesday.
Look atyou, Whitehurst.
You're a disgrace.
When's the last time you had a trim?
Two weeks ago, Sergeant, I think.
I want to seeyou right after breakfast.
Yes, sir, Sergeant Botnick, sir.
What'reyou looking at, new boy?
Wednesday.
Barclay, what're you doi ng?
You can't just get up in the middle of mess.
Major.
At ease!
Tyler.
H i, Barclay.
What's up?
I've got to talk to you about Chucky.
Have you seen him?
Not since last night.
He's hiding somewhere.
He's gonna lay low until he knows you're alone, and he's gonna come after you.
He wants to play.
Listen to me.
No matter what he says, no matter what he promises you, you've gotta stay away from him.
Don't let him fool you.
He's bad.
Charles isn't bad, he's a Good Guy.
It says so on his shirt.
He lies, Tyler.
He's hurt a lot of people.
I think colonel Cochrane was one of them.
You're just jealous because he's my best friend now instead of yours.
Look, you better keep this.
Whitehurst, you are, without a doubt the sorriest excuse for a soldier to ever
Face it, you're not cut out for this life.
Why don't you do yourself a favor and get lf l had any choice in the matter, I would, sir.
Smart ass.
Presto... you're bald.
What the hell?
How'd you get in there?
That haircut ain't regulation, soldier.
When's the last time you had a trim, huh?
Kiss it good-bye.
Presto...
you're dead.
Ha,ha,ha,ha.
It's definitelyyou.
Ha,ha,ha,ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
I just forgot my --
Boo!
The annual war games... have been an unbroken tradition here at Kent for over 50 years.
Colonel Cochrane was a man who believe in tradition.
He not only would have wanted us to go on,
He'd have ordered us to go on.
Therefore...
The war games.... will proceed as scheduled.
Lieutenant Colonel Shelton..
will command the blue team.
Major Rawlings will head up the reds.
The obiective is simple.
To capture the other team's flag... and bring it back here safely to base.
Rawlings.
You will pick up your weapons... in the armoy before moving out.
You will be using the standard issue Springfield aught-three.
Your ammo--
Shelton.
If you get hit, you are dead.
Hike back to base.
Commanders..
take charge of your teams.
May the best team win.
Good luck, men and women.
Nice of you to join us.
Looks like Botnick's in a pretty bad mood today.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing's wrong.
I'm fine.
Nothing's wrong.
This oughta slow the pricks down.
Left, left, left.
Here we goagain.
Here we go again.
Same old stuffagain.
Same old stuffagain.
Marching down the avenue.

Two more miles and we'll be through.
Two more miles and we'll be through.
I'll be gettin' rid of you.

Here we go again.

Marching down the avenue.
Marching down the avenue.
One more mile and we'll be through.
One more mile and we'll be through.
I'll be gettin' rid of you.
What's going on, Whitehurst?
You saw something, didn't you?
You saw Chucky.
Don't wimp out on me!
I need your help.
That kid needs your help.
Okay?
I didn't see anything at all.
Your left, right, your left.
Your militay left.
Ellis, let's make sure all the perimeters are secure.
She checks the windows.
And the baby-sitter hears this thump, thump, thumping.
Like something's being dragged across the floor upstairs.
Suddenly she thinks, "l haven't checed on the children"
So she hurries to the top of the stairs, and when she gets there... she sees her boyfriend completely dismembered, dragging himself across the floor by his chin.
Thump, slide.
Thump, slide.
Thump, slide.
Hey, you guys, I got a better story... and it's true.
It's about this mental institution... and it's a few miles away from here.
Hey.
Hope it wasn't something I said.
No. I'm sory.
Where doyou think the red team's camped out?
Could be anywhere.
Shelton'll find 'em, he always does.
By the way, you can call me Kristin.
What?
Kristin.
It's my first name.
Do you have one?
Andy.
Come on, Andy.
I want to show you something.
Pretty cool, huh?
Yeah, I almost forgot there were places like that... where peoplejust go to have fun.
listen!
Somebody's out there.
It's probably just a chipmunk or something.
Nothing scares you, does it?
No.
Man, I really got to get out of this body.
I'm going afterTyler.
Are you crazy?
You'll never find him.
Wanna bet?
I swiped this from Shelton's tent.
He sent out a reconnaissance mission right before we pitched camp.
The red team is somewhere around here.
That kid's a sitting duck, Whitehurst.
Are you with me... or not?
I'm sory, I can't.
Up and at 'em, ladies.
We're movin' out.
I want this camp to be a ghost town in five minutes.
I thought we weren't going till dawn, sir.
Someone stole the reconnaissance map, so we're making our move now.
Get going, Hanley.
You wouldn't know anything about a missing map, would you?
Where the hell's Barclay?
Whitehurst!
Colonel Shelton, you better have a look in here, sir.
What is it, Ellis?
Barclay's gone AWOL, sir.
He stole the map.
That little fucking traitor's doubling for the reds.
Where's Tyler?
He went AWOL with
Where's Andy?
Whitehurst, where is he?
Platoon, halt!
All right.
De Silva, you're gonna take the right flank.
Siegel, take the left.
Check in on the radio
Yes, sir.
All right, move it.
The rest ofus are gonna spread out and meet up
Move out.
Whitehurst, move!
Thanks for coming after me.
What are friend for?
Duck!
That was a close one.
Now we can play "Hide the soul"
I'm tired. I don't wanna play that dumb game anymore.
You're a fuckin' drag, you know that?
- Watch your mouth, Charles.
- Stop calling me that!
What's the knife for?
A good soldier is always prepared.
Barclay was right.
You're not a good guy.
Sorry kid.
You got me.
I'm bad
Now..
assume the position.
No!
Aaah!
Get back here!
Barclay!
Barclay!
Tyler!
You fuckin' traitor.
Give me my map!
Listen -- You got any idea what we
Tyler's in trouble.
Whitehurst, back me up.
Major Ellis, call in the flanks.
De Silva, Siegel, do you copy?
De Silva, do you copy?
De Silva, come in.
Aaah!
Siegel's on his way back.
No word yet from De Silva.
Keep tryin'.
Yes, sir.
Help!
Tyler!
Barclay!
Are you okay,
Looks like we got ourselves a little P.O.W.
Charles is bad.
He tried to hurt me.
Who the hell Charles?
Come in, Barclay.
It's Charles.
Who is this?
Put Barclay on,
It's the reds.
They're up to something.
What do you want?
I want the kid.
Bring him up to the old Jeep or there'll be hell to pay.
Andy, don't do it.
You hear that, Barclay?
Don't touch her,
Now bring me the kid or I'll waste her.
Red team, red team.
come in, red team.
This is red team, over.
We got a situation up
Blue team sighted.
Advise you to move your troops in.
Hope they like the taste of lead.
Now just sit back and watch the sparks fly.
All right, you two are gonna go on up ahead.
The rest ofus are gonna circle around.
Shelton, this is no game.
This guy is dangerous.
Relax, Barclay, it's only paint.
All right, All right let's do it.
I'm scared, Barclay.
Yeah, me too.
All right, kid.
Get over here!
No!
Don't fuck with me!
I'll blow all of you to pieces.
Beat it!
Now just get down and shut up.
Yeah!
Ow!
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
De Silva, where the hell is eveybody?
Hi, soldier.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Fuck me.
All right!
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Shit!

They're using live rounds!
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Hold your fire!

Sayonara, suckers.
Look out!
No!
Oh, my God, what happened?
What the hell happened?
Who fucked with the rifles?
Get Clark on the radio... and get me a medic up here right now!
All right, eveybody stay calm.
Epstein, I want that radio!
Oh, God.
This is the last time I'm gonna tell you
Give that thing a rest or you're out of here, both of you.
We're not bothering anybody.
You're bothering me.
Geez!
Mister, you gotta help me!
What's wrong?
Charles, Charles
Who's Charles?
He's a Good Guy.
Have a seat over there.
Are you from Kent?
What's your name, son?
Ronald Tyler.
Private first class, sir.
Have a seat.
How 'bout some gum, Private?
I know how it must hurt... when a friend does something bad to you.
Sure does.
But I bet your friend -- what's his name, Charles?
I bet you Charles didn't mean it.
I bet you he's really sorry.
No, he isn't.
He wants to hurt me.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
I know what'll cheer you up.
Look what I found.
There you go.
Thank you, Daddy.
Let's go on the Super Loop.
Hey, maybe somebody's seen him.
Oh, God.
Come on.
Wait.
Mommy, Mommy, I love it!
Were you scared?
No!
Let's have some popcorn and we'll go on one more ride.
Perfect.
In there.
Don't even think about it.

We're on our way in.
You'll have to come with us now, son.
[Screaming]
This is Andy Barclay.
Eight years ago he touched off the scandal... that nearly crippled this company, claiming that his Good Guy doll, Chucky, was possessed by...
Charles Lee Ray, the notorious Lakeshore Strangler.
Now I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, after the lawsuits and negative publicity, when the company is finally getting back on its feet, where is the wisdom in putting the Good Guy back on the market?
Mr. Sullivan, before this happened... the Good Guy outsold our other toys 2 to 1 .
Even now, interest in the marketplace is at its peak.
The factory is up and running again.
We should be in stores by next week.
We cannot let the fantasies of one disturbed boy... influence company policy.
What if the doll somehow... affects another child in a negative way?
You could have a public relations nightmare.
One of the hardest things about this business is... that it is a business.
Doesn't matter what we're selling.
Whether it's cars nuclear weapons ..
or yes, even toys.
The bottom line is the bottom line.
And what are children but consumer trainees?
Andy Barclay is ancient history.
No one remembers him.
Nobody cares.
I have made up my mind.
We're moving ahead.
Thank you.
Okay.
All right.
Mr. Sullivan.
if there's nothing I can say to convince you, then I must go on record.
I'm completely against this.
Your position is crystal clear, Miles.
And you can be sure I won't forget.
Just a minute, folks.
Mr. Sullivan, we have a surprise.
Guys at the factory sent this over.
First off the assembly line, the Good Guy of the '90s.
[Clapping]
If there's nothing else, I'm gonna get going.
Fine. it's just, my wife's expecting me.
it's our anniversary.
Fine, Petzold.
I could review the Larrabee report after dinner.
Good night, Mr. Sullivan.
Good night.
[Elevator Bell Dings]
Ahh.
Despite a downdraft in the bond market, stocks were able to post a rally on friday... thanks to a couple of different factors.
Not only did the employment report allay recession fears, but also there was a technical rebound in buying... and a resurgence in deal stocks helped set the tone.
Here's a look at the numbers.
The Dow industrial's up 1 6.
The transportation average up 3.
Utilities bouncing up--
Utilities bouncing up--
ln a moment's time --
Oh, shit.
[Tv] Bonds headed south on the economic data, which served to bolster the U.S. dollar.
The dollar index up a quarter point.
The CRB index up... point 43 at two-thirty point 43.
March crude up...

Don't fuck with the Chuck.
Oh, my God.

Just like the good old days.
Nothing like a strangulation to get the circulation going.
You're my only ticket out of here, Andy.
I gotta get out of this goddamn body.
Where are you, you little shit?
lnward hut.
Come on, come on.
Yeah,you can do it.
You can do it, Jackson, hury up.
Come on, let's go.
Yeah, come on.
Get moving.
Go to the end of the line.
[Drum Playing]
Left, left Left, left.
I see for the past eight years... you've been in one foster home after another.
Mind if I ask why?
They took me away from my mother.
She's under special care.
I know that.
How come you never got settled an_here?
Adjustment problems.
I can read, Barclay.
I'm asking you.
I never felt comfortable with those people.
They weren't family.
They were strangers.
All right, listen up, Barclay.
I'm willing to cut you some slack, because you've had it rough.
But you're a troublemaker.
And I got a problem with troublemakers.
They don't fit into the system.
So here's my advice.
Grow up!
You're not a kid anymore.
It's time to forget these fantasies of killer dolls.
Yes, sir.
"When I was a child,
"I thought as a child.
"When I became a man,
I put away childish things."
First Corinthians.
Look alive.
On your feet.
At Kent, we take bed wetters and turn 'em into men.
Oh, yes.
Yes, oh.
Yes, we're seeing some skin now, aren't we?
Presto, you're bald.
Always feels weird at first.
Next.
Kiss it good-bye.
The Romans invented the military cut.
You know why?
Why?
To keep their hair short, so their enemies couldn't grab it in battle... and slit their throat.
Ha, ha, ha.
Now hold still.
Oh, shit.
Ha, ha, ha.
[Tv] We're back and we're better than ever.
No one will play with me.
Uh-oh, there's a friend in need.
[Tv] Hey, cheer up.
Who are you?
I'm a Good Guy.
[Echoing] Good Guy, Good Guy, Good Guy!
I've just come from the Good Guy clubhouse... and I'll be your friend to the end.
You will?
[Echoing] Wow.
Sure I will.
Hi-de-ho.
All aboard for high-flying fun with me, your friend to the end, the Good Guy doll from Play Pals.
[Thumping]
[Thumping]
[Thumping]
Are you okay?
Bastards!
Fucking bastards!
What happened?
Shelton!
That's what happened!
Shelton and his goddamn lackeys.
Thank you.
I'm fine.
I'm Andy.
You must be new.
Otherwise... you'd know they don't tolerate individuality, nothing as personal as a first name.
Right.
I forgot.
- Barclay.
- Whitehurst.
Harold Aubrey, for the record.
So, who's this Shelton?
Cadet lieutenant Colonel Brett C. Shelton.
He's God around here.
Don't expect mercy from him.
Welcome to hell, Barclay.
All present and accounted for, sir.
Thank you, Major Ellis.
You're new boy, huh?
Yeah.
How you doing?
Pretty good.
Who said you could look at me?
Do you know who I am?
Shelton?
That's Lieutenant Colonel Shelton to you, asshole!
[Andy] Lieutenant Colonel Shelton.
Lieutenant Colonel...
Shelton... sir.
Lieutenant Colonel Shelton, sir.
-What's your name, dipweed?
- Barclay.
- Sir.
- Louder.
- Louder!
- Sir!
That's much better, new boy.
That's much better.
Shit, Whitehurst.
You are without a doubt... the most pathetic thing I have ever seen!
Wouldn't you agree?
I asked you a question, nimrod.
No, sir!
I don't agree, sir!
Are you contradicting me, you sorry-ass sack of shit?
You asshole.
- What did you say?
- I said, "You asshole;' sir!
Think you're pretty funny, don't you, De Silva?
Yes, I do, sir.
Drop and give me 25.
Right now.
25 what, sir?
25 push-ups, De Silva.
One, sir!
Two, sir!
Three, sir!
You women might think... that because you're so much more delicate... you deserve special treatment... and once a month... we're gonna get out of your way.
You can forget it!
13, sir!
14, sir!
The same rules apply for everybody.
18, sir!
Only the fittest survive.
22,sir!
23,sir!
One-handed.
24, sir!
25... sir!
Recover.
How you doing, Tyler?
Sorry, nothing from your dad.
Maybe tomorrow.
Listen, he's busy flying jets, defending the county.
He'll write when he gets a chance.
I know.
Hey!
I got a job for you.
Give this to the new kid for me.
- Barclay.
- Yes, sir.
That a boy.
Out of the way.
Watch it, kid.
Hey!
Look out!
A Good Guy.
[Yelling]
Who the fuck are you?
I thought you guys only said three sentences.
I'm new and improved.
I never saw a doll like you before.
All right, kid.
Fun's over.
Where the hell's Andy?
Andy?
Can't you read?
He was supposed to get this package.
Tampering with the mail is a federal offense.
Sorry.
Is he your best friend?
He's more than that.
He's my new lease on life.
Wait a minute.
I got a new body... and I ain't told anyone about my little secret yet.
So, what's your name, kid?
Tyler.
What's yours?
Chucky.
But my real name... is Charles Lee Ray.
[Shooting]
Whitehurst, what am I doing wrong?
ls there anything you can't do?
Yeah.
I can't get thrown out of this place.
Barclay, meet De Silva.
Hi.
Hi.
So, you want to show me?
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
No, put the elbow like that.
And like this.
No.
Keep both eyes open.
Keep your sights on the target.
Hold your breath.
Squeeze the trigger.
Don't pull it.
[Gunshot]
You're not concentrating.
It was great what you did for us at formation.
Shelton's a major dick.
Tell me about it.
[Gunshot]
[Gunshot]
[Chucky] Hold still.
What do you call this game?
"Hide the Soul." Trust me, you're gonna love it.
Whatever you say, Charles.
Ade due...
Damballa!
Give me the power, I beg of you!
[Thundering]
Leveau mercierdu bois chaloitte... secoisse entienne mais pois de--

We're gonna need the Springfield aught-threes...
Yes, sir.
marked for both the red team and the blue team.
What are you doing, Tyler?
We're playing "Hide the Soul."
I'll catch up with you.
I'll start loading the paint guns.
We don't play with dolls, do we?
Dolls are for girls.
But Charles is my new best friend.
You know better than to talk back to a superior.
Yes, sir.
Clean that up.
I'll take care of this.
[Good Guy Voice] I'll be back!
Left, left Left, right, left.
Left, left.
[Shelton] Get that weapon up, Barclay.
Platoon, halt.
Left face.
New boy!
Fall out.
Fall out!
[Shelton] Order, hut.
Port... arms!
Right shoulder... arms!
Left shoulder... arms.
Right shoulder, arms.

[Shelton] Port arms.
[Echoing] Left shoulder, arms.
[Echoing] Port arms.
[Echoing] Right shoulder, arms.
[Echoing] Port arms.
Barclay!
It's not a baton, Barclay.
You look like a goddamn majorette over here.
I'm not used to guns, sir.
Does this look like a gun to you, Barclay?
It's a rifle.
- Major Ellis!
- Sir!
Show the new boy the difference.
This is my rifle.
This is my gun.
This is for shooting and this is for fun.
A soldier's rifle is his best friend.
Remember that.
Stop!
Shit!
[Chucky] Help!
Please, mister!
Please, somebody!
Jesus!
I'm stuck, mister!
I'm in here!
Hold on!
I'm coming!
Where are you?
I'm coming.
Yell!
Make a noise!
Where are ya?
[Gasping]
Oh, my God!
No, stop!
[Laughing]
Stop!
[Yelling]
[Screaming]
[Screaming]
[Shelton] fall out!
You get back there.
Finish unpacking.
Shelton's notorious for surprise inspections.
What are you doing?
What's it look like?
I'm polishing Shelton's shoes.
He makes you polish his shoes?
No, I offered out of the kindness of my heart.
Whitehurst, did you see Cochrane with that doll today?
No, what doll?
He was carrying a Good Guy doll... just before the accident with the garbage truck.
Good Guys.
I remember those.
Yeah, me too.
[Spitting]
Lights out in a few minutes.
I'm gonna go get washed up.
I almost forgot.
Sgt. Clarkwanted to know if you got that package.
What package?
He said you got a package in the mail.
Tyler was supposed to bring it to you.
Didn't you get it?
No.
Who would have sent me a package?
Hey, long time no see, pal!
No, you're dead!
We killed you!
You know what they say.
"You just can't keep a good guy down."
[Laughing]
Andy, how you've grown.
You're not gonna kill me.
You need to transfer your soul.
Wrong again, wimp.
I got some fresh meat lined up.
I'm not gonna let you spoil it this time.
- Tyler?
- Yeah.
Just think.
Chucky's gonna be a "bro."
I'm not gonna let you get away with this.
I'm not gonna let you near that kid.
Agh!
[Laughing]
What's the matter?
You homesick?
You miss your mommy?
What the fuck is this?
I'm sorry about your shoe.
I'll polish it.
Give me back the doll.
No, you listen to me.
Tell Whitehurst he's off the hook.
I got myself another slave.
Clean up this mess.
You got five demerits.
What about the doll?
My kid sister's birthday's coming up.
I think she's gonna Cove it, don't you?
[Closet Door Creaking]
[Whispering] Oh, shit.
Andy.
What the fuck?
No, stop!
What the fuckyou doing in my room?
You wouldn't believe me.
Where's the doll Barclay?
Where's the fucking doll?
You took it, didn't you?
No!
What's going on?
Somebody sure as hell took it.
It's almost midnight.
Is this necessary?
I'm tying to weed out a thief. sir.
You've always told me how important it is... to uphold the school's code of honor.
All right, make your point.
But I want everybody back in at 01.00 hours.
Yes, sir.
By the time we get through with Barclay, he's gonna be living in a world full of shit.
We got an hour, so let's make it count.
Yes, sir.
Ladies, get those weapons in the air.
I want to see them high.
Higher!
I think I'm gonna throw up.
You're dead, new boy.
fucking geek.
"Dear Charles, you're it.
Come and find me.
Your best friend."
Shit!
Charles.
Come and find me.
Goddamn it.
Platoon!
[Cadets] Hut.
Double time!
Hut.
Knees up, ladies.
Whitehurst, where do the kids sleep?
Above the portico.
[Ellis] You're wearing combat boots, not ballet slippers!
[Ellis] Come on, move it Barclay.
[Ellis] it's gonna get worse than this.
Get the lead out.
Come on, move it.
Faster, faster.
Get those knees in the sky.
You son of a bitch!
Hell of a punch there, Barclay.
Now I'll see what kind of a tough guy you are.
Get your head around here.
[Giggling]
Tyler, come out, come out, wherever you are.
[Chucky] Dolly dolly oxen free!
Get out here, you little son of a bitch!
[Ellis] Three!
You're not sounding of_
Four!
Five!
All right, Barclay.
You got me curious.
What are you tying to prove?
Forget it.
I want to know.
All right.
The doll's alive.
- He's after Tyler.
- Right, forget it.
I hope he can take care of himself.
Shh, shh.
Quiet.
[Gasping, Laughing]
[Whispers] Shut up!
I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
Just stay here and keep an eye out.
Oh, I live for this.
I know, Ivers.
Now go, go.
Shh, shh.
I don't see what you see in that guy.
He's just different from everybody else.
Oh, please.
Well, he's cute too.
Okay.
[De Silva] foster homes.
No wonder he's so quiet.
[Thumping]
What was that?
So, you took the doll?
Shelton will have you court-martialed.
We're playing hide-and-seek.
What are you doing?
We couldn't sleep.
Oh, he is... so cute.
He was mine first.
Give him back.
Shh, you guys.
Please be quiet!
Can you go stand guard?
Yes, sir.
What's his name?
Ask him yourself.
Oh, right.
What is your name?
[Good Guy Voice] Hi, I'm Chucky and I'm your friend to the end.
Hi-de-ho.
Ha, ha.
I love it.
His real name is Charles Lee Ray.
Oh, is that so?
Give me your lipstick.
What for?
Just give it to me.
What are you doing?
Wait, stop.
You'll see.
[De Silva] Here you go, little baby.
[Tyler] You're messing him up.
You're so cute.
Don't do that.
He looks stupid!
You're making him look like a wuss!
He looks sweet.
What are you doing?
Someone's coming.
Come on, let's go.
Come on.
Wait.
Stop!
What about Charles?
Yuck!
This means war.
What the hell?
- I like to be hugged.
- Go--Jesus!
[Chuckles]
[Crash]
Aaah!
Aw, you gotta be fucking kidding' me.
[Gasping]
The man lives through two tours in Nam... and then one night he just drops dead.
Doesn't make any sense.
## [Reveille]
[Shelton] At ease.
We will now take a moment of silence to honor Colonel Cochrane.
He was a fine man and he will be sorely missed.
Bow your heads for prayer.
[Shelton] Take... seats!
It's gettin' pretty shaggy, Carlson.
I want to see you on Friday.
Yes, sir.
Monday, Fabrizzio.
Yes, sir.
My man.
Tuesday.
Look at you, Whitehurst.
You're a disgrace.
When's the last time you had a trim?
Two weeks ago, Sergeant, I think.
You think?
I want to see you right after breakfast.
Yes, sir, Sergeant Botnick, sir.
What're you looking at, new boy?
Wednesday.
Barclay, what're you doing?
You can't just get up in the middle of mess.
Major.
At ease!
Tyler.
Hi, Barclay.
What's up?
I've got to talk to you about Chucky.
You mean Charles.
Have you seen him?
Not since last night.
He's hiding somewhere.
He's gonna lay low until he knows you're alone, and he's gonna come after you.
He wants to play.
Listen to me.
No matter what he says, no matter what he promises you, you've gotta stay away from him.
Don't let him fool you.
He's bad.
Charles isn't bad, he's a Good Guy.
It says so on his shirt.
He lies, Tyler.
Believe me, he's bad news.
He's hurt a lot of people.
I think Colonel Cochrane was one of them.
You're just jealous because he's my best friend now instead of yours.
Look, you better keep this.
Whitehurst, you are, without a doubt the sorriest excuse for a soldier to ever disgrace these walls.
Face it, you're not cut out for this life.
Why don't you do yourself a favor and get the hell out of Kent?
If I had any choice in the matter, I would, sir.
Smart ass.
Presto... you're bald.
[Whistling]
What the hell?
How'd you get in there?
That haircut ain't regulation, soldier.
When's the last time you had a trim, huh?
Kiss it good-bye.
Presto...
you're dead.
Ha,ha,ha,ha.
It's definitely you.
Ha,ha,ha,ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
I just forgot my --
Boo!
The annual war games... have been an unbroken tradition here at Kent for over 50 years.
Colonel Cochrane was a man who believed in tradition.
He not only would have wanted us to go on, he'd have ordered us to go on.
Therefore... the war games.... will proceed as scheduled.
Lieutenant Colonel Shelton... will command the blue team.
Major Rawlings will head up the reds.
The objective is simple.
To capture the other team's flag... and bring it back here safely to base.
Rawlings.
You will pick up your weapons... in the armory before moving out.
You will be using the standard issue Springfield aught-three.
Your ammo--
Shelton.
If you get hit, you are dead.
Hike back to base.
Commanders... take charge of your teams.
May the best team win.
Good luck, men and women.
Nice of you to join us.
Looks like Botnick's in a pretty bad mood today.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing's wrong.
I'm fine.
Nothing's wrong.
This oughta slow the pricks down.
[Instructor] left, left, left.
Her ewe go again.
Here we go again.
Same old stuff again.
Same old stuff again.
Marching down the avenue.
Marching down the avenue.
Two more miles and we'll be through.
Two more miles and we'll be through.
I'll be gettin' rid of you.
I'll be gettin' rid of you.
Same old ugly stum.
Same old ugly stuff.
Her ewe go again.
Her ewe go again.
Marching down the avenue.
Marching down the avenue.
One more mile and we'll be through.
One more mile and we'll be through.
I'll be gettin' rid of you.
What's going on, Whitehurst?
You saw something, didn't you?
You saw Chucky.
Don't wimp out on me!
I need your help.
That kid needs your help.
I didn't see anything.
Okay?
I didn't see anything at all.
Your left, right, your left.
Your military left.
Ellis, let's make sure all the perimeters are secure.
Yes, sir.
She checks the windows.
And the baby-sitter hears this thump, thump, thumping.
Like something's being dragged across the floor upstairs.
Suddenly she thinks, "l haven't checked on the children."
So she hurries to the top of the stairs, and when she gets there... she sees her boyfriend completely dismembered, dragging himself across the floor by his chin.
Thump, slide.
Thump, slide.
Thump, slide.
[Ives] That was gross.
Hey, you guys, I got a betters toy... and it's true.
It's about this mental institution... and it's a few miles away from here.
Hey.
Hope it wasn't something I said.
[Chuckles] No.
I'm sorry.
Where do you think the red team's camped out?
Could be any here.
Shelton'll find 'em, he always does.
By the way, you can call me Kristin.
What?
Kristin.
It's my first name.
Do you have one?
Andy.
Come on, Andy.
I want to show you something.
Pretty cool, huh?
Yeah, I almost forgot there were places like that... where people just go to have fun.
[Twig Snaps] Listen!
Somebody's out there.
It's probably just a chipmunk or something.
Nothing scares you, does it?
No.
Man, I gotta get out of this body.
I'm going after Tyler.
Are you crazy?
You'll never find him.
Wanna bet?
I swiped this from Shelton's tent.
He sent out a reconnaissance mission right before we pitched camp.
The red team is somewhere around here.
That kid's a sitting duck, Whitehurst.
Are you with me... or not?
I'm sorry, I can't.
[Ellis] Up and at 'em, ladies.
We're movin' out.
I want this camp to be a ghost town in five minutes.
I thought we weren't going till dawn, sir.
Someone stole the reconnaissance map, so we're making Our Move now.
Get going, Hanley.
You wouldn't know anything about a missing map, would you?
Where the hell's Barclay?
Whitehurst!
Colonel Shelton, you better have a look in here, sir.
What is it, Ellis?
Barclay's gone AWOL, sir.
He stole the map.
That little fucking traitor's doubling for the reds.
Where's Tyler?
He went AWOL with some guy named Charles.
Where's Andy?
Whitehurst, where is he?
[Shelton] Platoon, halt!
All right.
De Silva, you're gonna take the right flank.
Siegel, take the left.
Check in on the radio every five minutes.
Yes, sir.
All right, move it.
The rest of us are gonna spread out and meet up with Ellis at Split Rock.
Move out.
Whitehurst, move!
Thanks for coming after me.
What are friends for?
Duck!
That was a close one.
Now we can play "Hide the Soul."
I'm tired.
I don't wanna play that dumb game anymore.
You're a fuckin' drag, you know that?
- Watch your mouth, Charles.
- Stop calling me that!
What's the knife for?
A good soldier is always prepared.
Barclay w_s right.
You're not a good guy.
Sorry kid.
You got me.
I'm bad.
Now... assume the position.
No!
Aaah!
Get back here!
Barclay!
Barclay!
Tyler!
You fuckin' traitor.
Give me my map!
Listen -
- You got any idea what we do to traitors, Barclay?
Tyler's in trouble.
Whitehurst, back me up.
Major Ellis, call in the flanks.
Yes, sir.
De Silva, Siegel, do you copy?
De Silva, do you copy?
[Radio] De Silva, come in.
Aaah!
Siegel's on his way back.
No word yet from De Silva.
Keep trying'.
Yes, sir.
Help!
Tyler!
Barclay!
Are you okay, Tyler?
Looks like we got ourselves a little P.O.W. You're right,
Charles is bad.
He tried to hurt me.
Who the hell's Charles?
[Chucky] Come in, Barclay.
Who the hell is that?
It's Charles.
Who is this?
Put Barclay on, jarhead.
[Ellis] It's the reds.
They're up to something.
What do you want?
I want the kid.
Bring him up to the old Jeep or there'll be hell to pay.
[De Silva] Andy, don't do it.
De Silva!
You hear that, Barclay?
Don't touch her, you son of a bitch.
Now bring me the kid or I'll waste her.
Red team, red team.
come in, red team.
This is red team, over.
We got a situation up here at the old Jeep.
Blue team sighted.
Advise you to move your troops in.
Hope they like the taste of lead.
Now just sit back and watch the sparks fly.
All right, you two are gonna go on up ahead.
The rest of us are gonna circle around.
Shelton, this is no game.
This guy is dangerous.
Relax, Barclay, it's only paint.
All right, let's do it.
I'm scared, Barclay.
Yeah, me too.
All right, kid.
Get over here!
No!
Don't fuckwith me!
I'll blow all of you to pieces.
Beat it!
Now just get down and shut up.
Yeah!
Ow!
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
De Silva, where the hell is everybody?
Hi, soldier.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Fuck me.
All right!
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Shit!
Stay down!
They're using live rounds!
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Oh, God, he's not breathing!
Get away from him!
You did this, didn't you?
You sick son of a bitch.
Now I'm gonna kill you!
Get off me!
Get off of him, he didn't do it!
Let go of me!
Savonarola, suckers.
Look out!
No!
Oh, my God, what happened?
[Ellis] It's Whitehurst.
What the hell happened?
Who fucked with the rifles?
I don't know.
[Ellis] Get Clark on the radio...
Yes, sir.
and get me a medic up here right now!
[Ellis] All right, everybody stay calm.
Epstein, I want that radio!
Oh, God.
[loud Rock Music] This is the last time I'm gonna tell you.
Give that thing a rest or you're out of here, both of you.
We're not bothering anybody.
You're bothering me.
Keep it down!
Geez!
Mister, you gotta help me!
What's wrong?
Charles, Charles he's after me.
Who's Charles?
He's a Good Guy.
He wants to play "Hide the Soul."
Have a seat over there.
Are you from Kent?
Yes, sir.
What's your name, son?
Ronald Tyler.
Private first class, sir.
Have a seat.
How 'bout some gum, Private?
I know how it must hurt... when a friend does something bad to you.
Sure does.
But I bet your friend -- what's his name, Charles?
I bet you Charles didn't mean it.
I bet you he's really sorry.
No, he isn't.
He wants to hurt me.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
I know what'll cheer you up.
Look what I found.
There you go.
Thank you, Daddy.
Let's go on the Super Loop.
Hey, maybe somebody's seen him.
Oh, God.
Come on.
Wait.
Mommy, Mommy, I loved it!
Were you scared?
No!
No!
Let's have some popcorn and we'll go on one more ride.
[Chucky] Perfect.

Don't even think about it.
Come on.
Okay.

Watch your head.
[Sirens Blaring]
(Winch clicking)
Aaaaaargh!
(Shutter clicks )
This is Andy Barclay.
Eight years ago, he started the scandal that nearly crippled this company, claiming his Good Guy doll Chucky Was possessed by...
Charles Lee Ray, the notorious Lakeshore Strangler.
(Murmuring)
I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, after all the lawsuits and negative publicity,
When the company is finally getting back on its feet again,
Where is the Wisdom in putting the Good Guy back on the market?
Mr Sullivan, before any of this happened, the Good Guy outsold all our other toys two to one.
Even now, interest in the marketplace is at its peak.
The factory is running again.
We should be in stores by next Week.
We cannot let the fantasies of one disturbed boy influence company policy.
What if the doll somehow affects another child in a negative Way?
You could have a public relations nightmare.
You know, one of the hardest things about this business is that it is a business.
It doesn't matter What We're selling,
Whether it's cars, nuclear Weapons, or, yes, even toys.
The bottom line is the bottom line.
And What are children, after all, but consumer trainees?
(Chuckling)
Andy Barclay is ancient history.
No one remembers him.
Nobody cares.
I have made up my mind.
We're moving ahead.
Thank you.
(Woman ) OK.
(Man ) All right.
Mr Sullivan.
If there's nothing I can say to convince you, then I must go on record With my position:
I'm against this.
Your position is crystal clear, Miles, and you can be sure I Won't forget.
Just a minute, folks!
We have a little surprise.
The guys at the factory sent this over.
It's the first one :
the Good Guy of the 90's!
(Applause and cheers )
Well, if there's nothing else, I'll get going.
Fine.
(Man ) It's just my Wife's expecting me.
I It's our anniversary.
I Fine, Petzold.
Well, I guess I could review the Larabie report after dinner.
I Good night, Mr Sullivan.
I Good night.
(Lift bell)
(Sighs )
(Ice clinking into glass )
(Ice rattling)
Ahh.
(Grunts )
(Heavy sigh)
'Despite a downdraught, 'stocks Were able to post a rally thanks to a couple of factors...'
(TV continues )
'In a moment...'
(Mutters )
(Groans )
Uh, Where is it?
(Groans )
Phew!
(TV continues )
(Groaning)
Ahh!

(Doll) Hi, my name is Larry.
(Doll 2) Hi, my name is Paulie.
I Hey, Wanna play?
I Hey, Wanna play?
I I like to be hugged.
I I like to be hugged.
I Hi, my name is Larry.
I Hi, my name is Paulie.
(Dolls continue dialogue )
(Dolls stop talking)
(Screams )
(Whimpers )
(Chucky laughs )
Don't fuck With the Chuck!
Oh, my God.
(Sullivan groans )
Ahh!
Bull'sI eye!
(Grunting)
Ahh!
(Screams )
(Chucky screaming)
Just like the good old days.
Nothing like a strangulation to get the circulation going.
You're my only ticket out of here, Andy.
I got to get out of this goddamn body.
Where are you, you little shit?
(Military drumbeat)
(Boy ) Left!
Left!
inward, hut!
(Woman ) Come on.
You can do it!
Come on.
You can do it, Jackson, hurry up.
Yeah!
Move.
Yes!
Come on.
Let's go.
Yeah!
Come on.
Get moving!
Go to the end of the line!
(Orders continue )
(Man ) I see that for the past eight years you've been in foster homes.
Mind if I ask Why?
They took me away from my mother.
She's, uh, under special care.
I know that.
I meant how come you never got settled anywhere?
Adjustment problems.
I can read, Barclay.
I'm asking you.
I never felt comfortable With those people.
They Weren't family, they Were strangers.
All right, listen up, Barclay.
I'm Willing to cut you slack because you've had it so rough, but you're a troublemaker.
And I got a real problem With troublemakers.
They don't fit into the system.
So here's my advice.
Grow up, you're not a kid any more.
It's time to forget these fantasies of killer dolls.
Yes, sir.
"When I Was a child, I thought as a child.
"But When I became a man, I put away childish things."
I Corinthians.
Look alive, Barclay, on your feet!
At Kent, We take bedI Wetters and turn them into men.
(Electric razor buZZes )
Oh, yes.
Yes.
Ooh, yes!
We're seeing some skin now, aren't We?
Presto!
You're bald.
(Chuckles )
Always feels a little Weird at first.
Next.
(TV) 'I'll get us out of this.'
'Move it.
Sit down.'
Kiss it goodbye.
(Cartoon voices continue )
You know, the Romans invented the military cut.
I You know Why?
I Why?
To keep their hair short so their enemies couldn't grab ahold of it in battle and slit their throat.
(Chuckling) Now, hold still.
(TV) 'Ah, look out, there.
Look out.'
(Cartoon continues )
Oh, shit.
(Chuckles )
(Boy on TV) 'We're back, and We're better than ever.'
'No one Will play With me.'
'UhI oh.
There's a friend in need.
'Hey, cheer up!
'
I (Boy ) 'Who are you?
' I 'I'm a Good Guy.'
("Good Guy" echoes )
'I've just come from the clubhouse, and I'll be your friend.'
'You Will?
.'
Wow!
'Sure I Will.'
(Both) 'HideyI ho!
'
'So, all aboard for highI flying fun
'With me, your friend till the end, 'the Good Guy doll from Play Pal.'
(Boy ) Come on, man!
(Thud)
(Banging)
(Banging)
(Banging continues )
Are you OK?
The bastards!
Fucking bastards!
What happened?
Shelton, that's What happened.
Shelton and his goddamn lackeys.
Thank you.
I'm fine.
I'm Andy.
You must be new.
Otherwise you'd know there's no individuality here.
Certainly no first names.
Yeah, right, I forgot.
Barclay.
Whitehurst.
Harold Aubrey for the record.
So, uh, Who's this Shelton?
Cadet Lieutenant Colonel Brett C Shelton.
He's God around here.
Don't expect any mercy from him.
Welcome to hell, Barclay.
I All present and accounted for.
I Thank you, Major Ellis.
You're a new boy, huh?
Yeah.
I How you doing?

Wouldn't you agree?
I asked you a question, nimrod!
No, sir!
I don't agree, sir!
Are you contradicting me, you sorryI ass sack of shit?

I'm new and improved.
I never saw a doll like you before.
All right, kid, fun's over.
Where the hell's Andy?
Andy?
Can't you read?
He Was supposed to get this package.
Tampering With the mail is a federal offence.
Sorry.
Is he your best friend?
He's more than that.
He's my new lease on life.
Wait a minute.
I got a new body, and I ain't told anyone about my little secret yet.
So, uh, What's your name, kid?
Tyler.
What's yours?
Chucky.
But, uh... my real name is Charles Lee Ray.
Hey, Whitehurst.
What am I doing Wrong?
Is there anything you can't do?
Yeah.
I can't seem to get thrown out of this place.
Barclay, meet De Silva.
I Hi.
I Hi.
So, um, Want to show me?
I Yeah, sure.
I OK.
No.
Put the elbow, yeah, like that.
And like this.
No.
Keep both eyes open.
Keep your sights on the target.
Now hold your breath.
squeeze the trigger, don't pull it.
You're not concentrating.
It Was really great What you did for us back there.
Shelton's a major dick.
Tell me about it.
(Tyler) Can't We play hide and seek?
(Chucky ) Hold still.
(Tyler) What do you call this game?
Hide the soul.
Trust me.
You're gonna love it.
Whatever you say, Charles.
Ade due damballa!
Give me the power, I beg of you!
(Thunderclap )
Leveau mercier du bois chailiotte!
Secoise entienne me pois de... (Door opens )
(Man ) Divide the troops in half.
Shit!
Charles, stop swearing.
Per soldier, We're gonna need the Springfield OI 3s marked for both the red team and the blue team.
What are you doing, Tyler?
We're playing hide the soul.
I I'll catch up With you.
I I'll load the paint.
We don't play With dolls, do We, Tyler?
Dolls are for girls.
But Charles is my new best friend.
Tyler, you know better than to talk back to a superior officer.
I Yes, sir.
I Clean that up.
I'll take care of this.
I'll be back!
(Thud)
Left!

Left shoulder.
Huh!
Arms.
Forward!
Right shoulder.
Huh!
(Garbled commands )
Barclay!
It's not a baton, Barclay.
You look like a goddamn majorette over here.
I'm not used to guns, sir.
Does this look like a gun to you, Barclay?
It's a rifle!
Major Ellis?
Show the new boy the difference!
This is my rifle, this is my gun.
This is for shooting, and this is for fun.
A soldier's rifle is his best friend.
Remember that.
Stop!
Shit!
(Chucky ) Help!
Please, mister!
Please, somebody!
I Jesus!
I (Chucky ) I'm stuck!
Mister!
I'm in here!
(Man ) Hold on.
I'm coming!
Where are you?
I'm coming.
Yell or something!
Make a noise!
Where are you?
What the...?
(Gasps )
Oh, my God.
No!
Stop!
(Sinister laughter)
Stop!
Ah!
Ahh!
(Screaming)
(Scream echoes )
(Shelton ) Fall out.
You get back there.
Better finish unpacking.
Shelton's notorious for surprise inspections.
What are you doing?
What does it look like?
I'm polishing Shelton's shoes.
He makes you polish his shoes?
No, I offered out of the kindness of my heart(!
)
Whitehurst, did you see Cochrane With that doll today?
No.
What doll?
.
He Was carrying a Good Guy doll just before the accident With the garbage truck.
Good Guys, I remember those.
Yeah, me, too.
Uh, lights out in a few minutes.
I'm going to go get Washed up.
Barclay, Sergeant Clark Wondered if you got that package.
I What package?
I You got a package in the mail.
Tyler Was bringing it.
Didn't you get it?
No.
Who sent me a package?
ow!
Hey, long time no see, pal.
No, you're dead.
We killed you!
You know What they say, you just can't keep a Good Guy down.
(Laughing)
Andy, how you've grown.
You're not gonna kill me.
You need my body.
Wrong again, Wimp.
I got fresh meat lined up and you Won't spoil it, not this time.
Tyler.
Yeah, just think.
Chucky's gonna be a bro.
I'm not gonna let you get away With this.
I'm not gonna let you near that kid.
(Chucky screaming)
What's the matter, Barclay, huh?
You homesick?
You miss your mommy?
What the fuck is this?
Sorry about your shoe.
I'll polish it.
Just give me back the doll.
No, no, you listen to me.
You tell Whitehurst he's off the hook.
I got myself another slave.
And clean up this mess.
You got five demerits.
What about the doll?
.
My kid sister's birthday is coming up.
I think she's gonna love it, don't you?
(Door creaks )
(Rustling)
Oh, shit.
Andy.
What the fuck?
No, stop!
What the fuck are you doing?
You Wouldn't believe me.
Where's the doll, Barclay?
Where's the fucking doll?
.
I You took it.
I No!
What's going on?
Somebody sure as hell took it.
It's almost midnight, Colonel.
Is this really necessary?
I'm Weeding out a thief, sir.
You've told me it's important to uphold the honour code.
I'm trying to impress that upon the men, sir.
All right, Shelton, make your point.
But I Want everybody back inside at O1OO hours.
Yes, sir.
When We get through With Barclay, he'll be living in a World of shit.
We've got an hour so let's make it count.
Yes, sir.
(Ellis ) All right, ladies, get those Weapons in the air.
I Want to see 'em high!
Higher!
I think I'm gonna throw up.
(Boy ) You're dead, new boy.
(Second boy ) Fucking geek.
"Dear Charles, you're it.
Come and find me, your best friend."
Shit.
(Tyler) Charles.
Come and find me!
God damn it.
I Platoon!
I (Soldiers yell)
Double time!
(Soldiers yell)
Get those knees up, ladies!
I Where do the kids sleep?
I Above the portico, Why?
(Ellis ) You're Wearing combat boots, not ballet slippers.
I Come on, move!
I Barclay?
(Ellis ) It can get Worse than this!
Get the lead out.
Move it!
Faster, faster.
Let's go, girls.
Keep those knees in the sky!
You son of a bitch!
Hell of a punch there, Barclay.
Let's see What kind of tough guy you are.
Get your head around.
(Giggles )
(Giggles )
Tyler, come out, come out, Wherever you are!
(Chucky ) OllyI olly oxenI free!
Get out here, you little son of a bitch.
(Ellis ) Three!
(Soldiers ) Three!
(Soldiers ) Four!
(Ellis ) You're pissing me off!
All right, Barclay, I'm curious.
What are you trying to prove?
I Forget it.
I No, really, I Want to know.
All right.
The doll's alive.
He's after Tyler.
I Right.
Forget it.
I I hope he can handle himself.
(De Silva, Whispering) Shut up.
(Girl) I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
(De Silva ) Stay here and keep Watch.
I I live for this.
I So go, go!
You know, I don't see What you see in that guy, anyway.
I don't know, he's different from everybody else.
I Oh, please.
I He's kind of cute, too.
OK.
Foster homes.
No Wonder he's so quiet.
(Thump )
What Was that?
So you took the doll?
.
Shelton Will have you courtI martialled.
We're playing.
What are you guys doing?
We couldn't sleep.
Oh!
Oh, he is so cute.
(Tyler)He Was mine first!
Give him back!
Give him back!
Shh!
You guys, please be quiet.
I Will you go stand guard?
I Yes, sir(!
)
So What's his name?
I Ask him yourself.
I All right.
What is your name, little doll?
.
Hi, I'm Chucky.
I'm your friend to the end.
HideyI ho!
Ha ha!
I love it.
His real name is Charles Lee Ray.
Oh, is that so?
Give me your lipstick.
I What for?
I Just give it to me.
I What are you doing?
I You'll see.
Wait.
Stop.
I Here you go, baby!
I You're messing him up!
You're so cute.
(Tyler) Don't do that!
Don't.
He looks stupid.
He looks like a Wuss.
No, he looks sweet.
(Distant clang)
You guys, someone's coming.
Come on, let's go.
(Tyler) Stop!
What about Charles?
Bleurgh!
This means War.
What the hell?
.
I like to be hugged.
(Clattering)
(Screaming)
(Gasping)
(Groaning)
Oh, you got to be fucking kidding me!
(Gasping)
A man lives through two tours in Nam, then one night he just drops dead.
Doesn't make any sense.
( # Reveille )
(Shelton ) At ease!
We Will now take a moment of silence to honour Colonel Cochrane.
He Was a fine man, and he Will be sorely missed.
Bow your heads for prayer.
(Man ) Take two!
It's getting shaggy, Carlson.
I Want to see you on Friday.
Yes, sir.
I Monday, Fabricio.
I Yes, sir.
My man.
Tuesday.
Look at you, Whitehurst.
You're a disgrace.
When's the last time you had a trim?
two Weeks ago, Sergeant, I think.
You think?
!
I Want to see you right after breakfast.
Got it?
Yes, sir, Sergeant Botnick, sir.
And What are you looking at, new boy?
Wednesday.
Barclay, What are you doing?
You can't get up during mess.
(All laughing)
Major.
At ease!
I Tyler.
I Hi, Barclay.
What's up?
I gotta talk to you about Chucky.
You mean Charles.
Have you seen him?
I Not since last night.
I He's hiding somewhere.
He'll lay low till you're alone, then he'll come after you.
I He's just playing.
I Listen.
No matter What he says or What he promises you, stay away from him.
He's bad.
Charles isn't bad.
He's a Good Guy.
It says so on his shirt.
He lies, Tyler.
Believe me, he's bad news.
He's hurt a lot of people.
Colonel Cochrane Was one of them.
You're jealous because he's my best friend instead of yours.
Look.
You better keep this.
Whitehurst, you are Without a doubt the sorriest excuse for a soldier to ever disgrace these Walls.
Face it, you're not cut out for this life.
Do yourself a favour and get the hell out of Kent.
If I had any choice in the matter, I Would, sir.
SmartI ass.
Presto.
You're bald.
(Whistling)
What the hell?
.
How did you get in there?
That haircut ain't regulation, soldier.
When's the last time you had a trim, huh?
Kiss it goodbye.
(BuZZing)
(Laughing)
Presto.
You're dead.
(Chucky laughing)
It's definitely you.
(Cackling)
I just forgot my...
Boo!
The annual War games have been a tradition at Kent for over 5O years.
Colonel Cochrane believed in the value of tradition.
He not only Would have Wanted us to go on, he'd have ordered us to go on.
Therefore, the War games Will proceed as scheduled.
(Soldiers yell)
Lieutenant Colonel Shelton Will command the blue team.
Major Rollins Will head up the reds.
The objective is simple:
to capture the other team's flag, bring it back here safely to base.
Rollins.
You Will pick up your Weapons in the armoury before moving out.
You Will be using the standard issue Springfield OI 3.
Your ammo.
Shelton.
If you get hit, you are dead.
Hike back to base.
Commanders, take charge of your teams.
May the best team Win.
Good luck, men and Women.
Nice of you to join us.
Looks like Botnick's in a pretty bad mood today.
I What's Wrong?
I Nothing.
Nothing's Wrong.
Nothing's Wrong.
I'm fine.
Nothing's Wrong.
This ought to slow the pricks down.

Don't Wimp out on me now.
I need your help.
That kid needs your help.
I didn't see anything, OK?
I didn't see anything at all.

Ellis, let's make sure the perimeters are secured.
She checks all the Windows, and then the babysitter hears this thump, thump.
Thumping.
Like something's being dragged across the floor upstairs.
And suddenly she thinks, "I haven't checked on the children."
So she hurries to the top of the stairs, and When she gets there, she sees her boyfriend, completely dismembered, dragging himself across the floor by his chin.
Thump.
Slide.
Thump.
Slide.
I Thump.
Slide.
I (Girl) That is gross.
Hey, you guys, I got a better story and it's true.
It's about this mental institution, and it's a few miles away from here.
Hey!
Hope it Wasn't something I said.
No.
I'm sorry.
De Silva, Where do you think the red team's camped out?
Could be anywhere.
Shelton'll find them.
He always does.
By the Way, you can call me Kirsten.
I What?
I Kirsten.
It's my first name.
Do you have one?
I Andy.
I Oh.
Come on, Andy, I Want to show you something.
Pretty cool, huh?
Yeah.
(Barclay ) I forgot those places exist.
People just go to have fun.
I (Crackling) I Listen!
Somebody's out there.
It's probably just a chipmunk or something.
I Nothing scares you, does it?
I No.
Man, I really gotta get out of this body!
I'm going after Tyler.
Are you crazy?
You'll never find them.
Want to bet?
I swiped this from Shelton's tent.
He sent out a reconnaissance mission right before We pitched camp.
The red team is somewhere around here.
That kid's a sitting duck, Whitehurst.
Are you With me or not?
I'm sorry, I can't.
(Ellis ) Up and at 'em, ladies, We're moving out!
I Want this camp to be a ghost town in five minutes!
I thought We Weren't going until dawn.
Someone stole the map so We're making our move now.
Get going, Hanley.
Whitehurst.
You Wouldn't know anything about a missing map, Would you?
Where the hell's Barclay?
Whitehurst!
Colonel Shelton, you'd better have a look in here, sir.
What is it, Ellis?
Barclay's gone awol, sir.
He stole the map.
That little fucking traitor's doubling for the reds!
Where's Tyler?
He Went awOL With some guy named Charles.
Where's Andy?
Whitehurst, Where is he?
(Ellis ) Platoon, halt!
All right.
De Silva, you're going to take the right flank.
Siegel, you take the left.
Check in on the radio every five minutes.
Move it.
The rest Will spread out and meet Ellis at Split Rock.
Move out!
Whitehurst, move!
I Thanks for coming after me.
I What are friends for?
Duck.
I That Was a close one.
I Now We can play hide the soul.
I'm tired.
I don't Want to play that dumb game any more.
You're a fucking drag, you know that?
Watch your mouth, Charles.
Stop calling me that!
What's the knife for?
A good soldier is always prepared, Tyler.
Barclay Was right.
You're not a Good Guy.
Sorry, kid, you got me.
I'm bad.
Now, assume the position.
(Tyler) No!
(Chucky ) Ahh!
Get back here!
Barclay!
Barclay!
Tyler!
(twig snaps )
Barclay, you fucking traitor, give me my map!
Listen...
You got any idea What We do to traitors?
Tyler's in trouble.
Come on, Whitehurst, back me up.
I Major Ellis, call in the flanks.
I Yes, sir.
De Silva, Siegel, do you copy?
De Silva, do you copy?
(Ellis on radio ) 'De Silva, come in.'
I Ahh!
I Ahh!
Siegel's on his Way back, sir.
I No Word yet from De Silva.
I Keep trying.
I Help!
Help!
I Tyler!
I Barclay!
I Are you OK, Tyler?
Well, looks like We got ourselves a little Pow.
Barclay, you Were right.
Charles is bad.
He tried to hurt me.
Who the hell's Charles?
(Chucky on radio ) 'Come in, Barclay.
Come in.'
I Who the hell is that?
I It's Charles.
I Who is this?
I (Chucky ) 'Put Barclay on, jarhead.'
It's the reds.
They're up to something.
What do you Want?
'I Want the kid.
Bring him to the old Jeep or there'll be hell to pay.'
I (De Silva ) 'Andy, don't do it!
' I De Silva!
You hear that, Barclay?
(Barclay ) 'Don't touch her, you son of a bitch.'
Bring me the kid or I'll Waste her.
Red team, red team.
Come in, red team.
(Rollins ) 'This is red team.
Over.'
(Chucky ) We got a situation up at the old Jeep.
Blue team sighted.
Advise you to move your troops in.
(Chucky ) I hope they like the taste of lead.
Now just sit back and Watch the sparks fly.
All right, you two go on up ahead, draw 'em out.
We'll circle around.
Shelton, this is no game.
This guy is dangerous.
Relax, Barclay.
It's only paint.
All right.
Let's do it.
I I'm scared, Barclay.
I Yeah, me too.
All right, kid.
Get over here!
No.
Don't fuck With me!
I'll blow all of you to pieces!
Beat it.
Now, just get down and shut up!
Yeah!
(Gunfire )

I Hold your fire!
I (Ellis ) Hold your fire!
De Silva, Where the hell is everybody?
Hi, soldier.
Fuck me.

(Gunfire )
I Stay down!
I They're using live rounds!
(Cackling)
(Gunfire continues )
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
I Hold your fire!
I (Chucky laughing)
Oh, God, he's not breathing.
Get away from him!
You did this, didn't you?
You sick son of a bitch!

Stop it!
Get off of him!
He didn't do it!

This is Andy Barclay.
Eight years ago he touched off the scandal... that nearly crippled this company, claiming that his Good Guy doll, Chucky, was possessed by...
Charles Lee Ray, the notorious Lakeshore Strangler.
Now I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, after the lawsuits and negative publicity, when the company is finally getting back on its feet, where is the wisdom in putting the Good Guy back on the market?
Mr. Sullivan, before this happened... the Good Guy outsold our other toys 2 to 1 .
Even now, interest in the marketplace is at its peak.
The factory is up and running again.
We should be in stores by next week.
We cannot let the fantasies of one disturbed boy... influence company policy.
What if the doll somehow... affects another child in a negative way?
You could have a public relations nightmare.
One of the hardest things about this business is... that it is a business.
Doesn't matter what we're selling.
Whether it's cars nuclear weapons ..
or yes, even toys.
The bottom line is the bottom line.
And what are children but consumer trainees?
Andy Barclay is ancient history.
No one remembers him.
Nobody cares.
I have made up my mind.
We're moving ahead.
Thank you.
Okay.
All right.
Mr. Sullivan.
if there's nothing I can say to convince you, then I must go on record.
I'm completely against this.
Your position is crystal clear, Miles.
And you can be sure I won't forget.
Just a minute, folks.
Mr. Sullivan, we have a surprise.
Guys at the factory sent this over.
First off the assembly line, the Good Guy of the '90s.
If there's nothing else, I'm gonna get going.
Fine. it's just, my wife's expecting me.
It's our anniversary.
Fine, Petzold.
I could review the Larrabee report after dinner.
Good night, Mr. Sullivan.
Good night.
Ahh.
Despite a downdraft in the bond market, stocks were able to post a rally on friday... thanks to a couple of different factors.
Not only did the employment report allay recession fears, but also there was a technical rebound in buying... and a resurgence in deal stocks helped set the tone.
Here's a look at the numbers.
The Dow industrial's up 1 6.
The transportation average up 3.

In a moment's time --
Oh, shit.
Bonds headed south on the economic data, which served to bolster the U.S. dollar.
The dollar index up a quarter point.
The CRB index up... point 43 at two-thirty point 43.
March crude up...
Hi, my name is Larry.

Don't fuck with the Chuck.
Oh, my God.
Just like the good old days.
Nothing like a strangulation to get the circulation going.
You're my only ticket out of here, Andy.
I gotta get out of this goddamn body.
Where are you, you little shit?
Inward hut.
Come on, come on.
Yeah,you can do it.
You can do it, Jackson, hurry up.
Come on, let's go.
Yeah, come on.
Get moving.
Go to the end of the line.
Left, left Left, left.
I see for the past eight years... you've been in one foster home after another.
Mind if I ask why?
They took me away from my mother.
She's under special care.
I know that.
How come you never got settled an_here?
Adjustment problems.
I can read, Barclay.
I'm asking you.
I never felt comfortable with those people.
They weren't family.
They were strangers.
All right, listen up, Barclay.
I'm willing to cut you some slack, because you've had it rough.
But you're a troublemaker.
And I got a problem with troublemakers.
They don't fit into the system.
So here's my advice.
Grow up!
You're not a kid anymore.
It's time to forget these fantasies of killer dolls.
Yes, sir.
"When I was a child,
"I thought as a child.
"When I became a man,
I put away childish things."
First Corinthians.
Look alive.
On your feet.
At Kent, we take bed wetters and turn 'em into men.
Oh, yes.
Yes, oh.
Yes, we're seeing some skin now, aren't we?
Presto, you're bald.
Always feels weird at first.
Next.
Kiss it good-bye.
The Romans invented the military cut.
You know why?
Why?
To keep their hair short, so their enemies couldn't grab it in battle... and slit their throat.
Ha, ha, ha.
Now hold still.
Oh, shit.
Ha, ha, ha.
We're back and we're better than ever.
No one will play with me.
Uh-oh, there's a friend in need.
Hey, cheer up.
Who are you?
I'm a Good Guy.
Good Guy, Good Guy, Good Guy!
I've just come from the Good Guy clubhouse... and I'll be your friend to the end.
You will?
Wow.
Sure I will.
Hi-de-ho.
All aboard for high-flying fun with me, your friend to the end, the Good Guy doll from Play Pals.
Are you okay?
Bastards!
Fucking bastards!
What happened?
Shelton!
That's what happened!
Shelton and his goddamn lackeys.
Thank you.
I'm fine.
I'm Andy.
You must be new.
Otherwise... you'd know they don't tolerate individuality, nothing as personal as a first name.
Right.
I forgot.
- Barclay.
- Whitehurst.
Harold Aubrey, for the record.
So, who's this Shelton?
Cadet lieutenant Colonel Brett C. Shelton.
He's God around here.
Don't expect mercy from him.
Welcome to hell, Barclay.
All present and accounted for, sir.
Thank you, Major Ellis.
You're new boy, huh?
Yeah.
How you doing?
Pretty good.
Who said you could look at me?
Do you know who I am?
Shelton?
That's Lieutenant Colonel Shelton to you, asshole!
Lieutenant Colonel Shelton.
Lieutenant Colonel...
Shelton... sir.
Lieutenant Colonel Shelton, sir.
-What's your name, dipweed?
- Barclay.
- Sir.
- Louder.
- Louder!
- Sir!
That's much better, new boy.
That's much better.
Shit, Whitehurst.
You are without a doubt... the most pathetic thing I have ever seen!
Wouldn't you agree?
I asked you a question, nimrod.
No, sir!
I don't agree, sir!
Are you contradicting me, you sorry-ass sack of shit?
You asshole.
- What did you say?
- I said, "You asshole;' sir!
Think you're pretty funny, don't you, De Silva?
Yes, I do, sir.
Drop and give me 25.
Right now.
25 what, sir?
25 push-ups, De Silva.
One, sir!
Two, sir!
Three, sir!
You women might think... that because you're so much more delicate... you deserve special treatment... and once a month... we're gonna get out of your way.
You can forget it!
13, sir!
14, sir!
The same rules apply for everybody.
18, sir!
Only the fittest survive.
22, sir!
23, sir!
One-handed.
24, sir!
25... sir!
Recover.
How you doing, Tyler?
Sorry, nothing from your dad.
Maybe tomorrow.
Listen, he's busy flying jets, defending the county.
He'll write when he gets a chance.
I know.
Hey!
I got a job for you.
Give this to the new kid for me.
- Barclay.
- Yes, sir.
That a boy.
Out of the way.
Watch it, kid.
Hey!
Look out!
A Good Guy.
Who the fuck are you?
I thought you guys only said three sentences.
I'm new and improved.
I never saw a doll like you before.
All right, kid.
Fun's over.
Where the hell's Andy?
Andy?
Can't you read?
He was supposed to get this package.
Tampering with the mail is a federal offense.
Sorry.
Is he your best friend?
He's more than that.
He's my new lease on life.
Wait a minute.
I got a new body... and I ain't told anyone about my little secret yet.
So, what's your name, kid?
Tyler.
What's yours?
Chucky.
But my real name... is Charles Lee Ray.
Whitehurst, what am I doing wrong?
ls there anything you can't do?
Yeah.
I can't get thrown out of this place.
Barclay, meet De Silva.
Hi.
Hi.
So, you want to show me?
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
No, put the elbow like that.
And like this.
No.
Keep both eyes open.
Keep your sights on the target.
Hold your breath.
Squeeze the trigger.
Don't pull it.
You're not concentrating.
It was great what you did for us at formation.
Shelton's a major dick.
Tell me about it.
Hold still.
What do you call this game?
"Hide the Soul." Trust me, you're gonna love it.
Whatever you say, Charles.
Ade due...
Damballa!
Give me the power, I beg of you!
Leveau mercier du bois chaloitte... secoisse entienne mais pois de--
- Shit!
- Charles, stop swearing.
We're gonna need the Springfield aught-threes...
Yes, sir.
Marked for both the red team and the blue team.
What are you doing, Tyler?
We're playing "Hide the Soul."
I'll catch up with you.
I'll start loading the paint guns.
We don't play with dolls, do we?
Dolls are for girls.
But Charles is my new best friend.
You know better than to talk back to a superior.
Yes, sir.
Clean that up.
I'll take care of this.
I'll be back!
Left, left Left, right, left.
Left, left.
Get that weapon up, Barclay.
Platoon, halt.
Left face.
New boy!
Fall out.
Fall out!
Order, hut.
Port... arms!
Right shoulder... arms!
Left shoulder... arms.
Right shoulder, arms.
left shoulder, arms.
Port arms.
Left shoulder, arms.
Port arms.
Right shoulder, arms.
Port arms.
Barclay!
It's not a baton, Barclay.
You look like a goddamn majorette over here.
I'm not used to guns, sir.
Does this look like a gun to you, Barclay?
It's a rifle.
- Major Ellis!
- Sir!
Show the new boy the difference.
This is my rifle.
This is my gun.
This is for shooting and this is for fun.
A soldier's rifle is his best friend.
Remember that.
Stop!
Shit!
Help!
Please, mister!
Please, somebody!
Jesus!
I'm stuck, mister!
I'm in here!
Hold on!
I'm coming!
Where are you?
I'm coming.
Yell!
Make a noise!
Where are ya?
Oh, my God!
No, stop!
Stop!
fall out!
You get back there.
Finish unpacking.
Shelton's notorious for surprise inspections.
What are you doing?
What's it look like?
I'm polishing Shelton's shoes.
He makes you polish his shoes?
No, I offered out of the kindness of my heart.
Whitehurst, did you see Cochrane with that doll today?
No, what doll?
He was carrying a Good Guy doll... just before the accident with the garbage truck.
Good Guys.
I remember those.
Yeah, me too.
Lights out in a few minutes.
I'm gonna go get washed up.
I almost forgot.
Sgt. Clark wanted to know if you got that package.
What package?
He said you got a package in the mail.
Tyler was supposed to bring it to you.
Didn't you get it?
No.
Who would have sent me a package?
Hey, long time no see, pal!
No, you're dead!
We killed you!
You know what they say.
"You just can't keep a good guy down."
Andy, how you've grown.
You're not gonna kill me.
You need to transfer your soul.
Wrong again, wimp.
I got some fresh meat lined up.
I'm not gonna let you spoil it this time.
- Tyler?
- Yeah.
Just think.
Chucky's gonna be a "bro."
I'm not gonna let you get away with this.
I'm not gonna let you near that kid.
Agh!
What's the matter?
You homesick?
You miss your mommy?
What the fuck is this?
I'm sorry about your shoe.
I'll polish it.
Give me back the doll.
No, you listen to me.
Tell Whitehurst he's off the hook.
I got myself another slave.
Clean up this mess.
You got five demerits.
What about the doll?
My kid sister's birthday's coming up.
I think she's gonna Cove it, don't you?
Oh, shit.
Andy.
What the fuck?
No, stop!
What the fuck you doing in my room?
You wouldn't believe me.
Where's the doll Barclay?
Where's the fucking doll?
You took it, didn't you?
No!
What's going on?
Somebody sure as hell took it.
It's almost midnight.
Is this necessary?
I'm tying to weed out a thief. sir.
You've always told me how important it is... to uphold the school's code of honor.
All right, make your point.
But I want everybody back in at 01.00 hours.
Yes, sir.
By the time we get through with Barclay, he's gonna be living in a world full of shit.
We got an hour, so let's make it count.
Yes, sir.
Ladies, get those weapons in the air.
I want to see them high.
Higher!
I think I'm gonna throw up.
You're dead, new boy.
fucking geek.
"Dear Charles, you're it.
Come and find me.
Your best friend."
Shit!
Charles.
Come and find me.
Goddamn it.
- Platoon!
- Hut.
Double time!
Hut.
Knees up, ladies.
Whitehurst, where do the kids sleep?
Above the portico.
You're wearing combat boots, not ballet slippers!
Come on, move it Barclay.
it's gonna get worse than this.
Get the lead out.
Come on, move it.
Faster, faster.
Get those knees in the sky.
You son of a bitch!
Hell of a punch there, Barclay.
Now I'll see what kind of a tough guy you are.
Get your head around here.
Tyler, come out, come out, wherever you are.
Dolly dolly oxen free!
Get out here, you little son of a bitch!
Three!
You're not sounding of_
Four!
Five!
All right, Barclay.
You got me curious.
What are you tying to prove?
Forget it.
I want to know.
All right.
The doll's alive.
- He's after Tyler.
- Right, forget it.
I hope he can take care of himself.
Shh, shh.
Quiet.
Shut up!
I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
Just stay here and keep an eye out.
Oh, I live for this.
I know, Ivers.
Now go, go.
Shh, shh.
I don't see what you see in that guy.
He's just different from everybody else.
Oh, please.
Well, he's cute too.
Okay.
foster homes.
No wonder he's so quiet.
What was that?
So, you took the doll?
Shelton will have you court-martialed.
We're playing hide-and-seek.
What are you doing?
We couldn't sleep.
Oh, he is... so cute.
He was mine first.
Give him back.
Shh, you guys.
Please be quiet!
Can you go stand guard?
Yes, sir.
What's his name?
Ask him yourself.
Oh, right.
What is your name?
Hi, I'm Chucky and I'm your friend to the end.
Hi-de-ho.
Ha, ha.
I love it.
His real name is Charles Lee Ray.
Oh, is that so?
Give me your lipstick.
What for?
Just give it to me.
What are you doing?
Wait, stop.
You'll see.
Here you go, little baby.
You're messing him up.
You're so cute.
Don't do that.
He looks stupid!
You're making him look like a wuss!
He looks sweet.
What are you doing?
Someone's coming.
Come on, let's go.
Come on.
Wait.
Stop!
What about Charles?
Yuck!
This means war.
What the hell?
- I like to be hugged.
- Go--Jesus!
Aaah!
Aw, you gotta be fucking kidding' me.
The man lives through two tours in Nam... and then one night he just drops dead.
Doesn't make any sense.
At ease.
We will now take a moment of silence to honor Colonel Cochrane.
He was a fine man and he will be sorely missed.
Bow your heads for prayer.
Take... seats!
It's gettin' pretty shaggy, Carlson.
I want to see you on Friday.
Yes, sir.
Monday, Fabrizzio.
Yes, sir.
My man.
Tuesday.
Look at you, Whitehurst.
You're a disgrace.
When's the last time you had a trim?
Two weeks ago, Sergeant, I think.
You think?
I want to see you right after breakfast.
Yes, sir, Sergeant Botnick, sir.
What're you looking at, new boy?
Wednesday.
Barclay, what're you doing?
You can't just get up in the middle of mess.
Major.
At ease!
Tyler.
Hi, Barclay.
What's up?
I've got to talk to you about Chucky.
You mean Charles.
Have you seen him?
Not since last night.
He's hiding somewhere.
He's gonna lay low until he knows you're alone, and he's gonna come after you.
He wants to play.
Listen to me.
No matter what he says, no matter what he promises you, you've gotta stay away from him.
Don't let him fool you.
He's bad.
Charles isn't bad, he's a Good Guy.
It says so on his shirt.
He lies, Tyler.
Believe me, he's bad news.
He's hurt a lot of people.
I think Colonel Cochrane was one of them.
You're just jealous because he's my best friend now instead of yours.
Look, you better keep this.
Whitehurst, you are, without a doubt the sorriest excuse for a soldier to ever disgrace these walls.
Face it, you're not cut out for this life.
Why don't you do yourself a favor and get the hell out of Kent?
If I had any choice in the matter, I would, sir.
Smart ass.
Presto... you're bald.
What the hell?
How'd you get in there?
That haircut ain't regulation, soldier.
When's the last time you had a trim, huh?
Kiss it good-bye.
Presto...
you're dead.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
It's definitely you.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
I just forgot my --
Boo!
The annual war games... have been an unbroken tradition here at Kent for over 50 years.
Colonel Cochrane was a man who believed in tradition.
He not only would have wanted us to go on, he'd have ordered us to go on.
Therefore... the war games.... will proceed as scheduled.
Lieutenant Colonel Shelton... will command the blue team.
Major Rawlings will head up the reds.
The objective is simple.
To capture the other team's flag... and bring it back here safely to base.
Rawlings.
You will pick up your weapons... in the armory before moving out.
You will be using the standard issue Springfield aught-three.
Your ammo--
Shelton.
If you get hit, you are dead.
Hike back to base.
Commanders... take charge of your teams.
May the best team win.
Good luck, men and women.
Nice of you to join us.
Looks like Botnick's in a pretty bad mood today.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing's wrong.
I'm fine.
Nothing's wrong.
This oughta slow the pricks down.
left, left, left.
Her ewe go again.
Here we go again.
Same old stuff again.
Same old stuff again.
Marching down the avenue.
Marching down the avenue.
Two more miles and we'll be through.
Two more miles and we'll be through.
I'll be gettin' rid of you.
I'll be gettin' rid of you.
Same old ugly stuff.
Same old ugly stuff.
Her ewe go again.
Her ewe go again.
Marching down the avenue.
Marching down the avenue.
One more mile and we'll be through.
One more mile and we'll be through.
I'll be gettin' rid of you.
What's going on, Whitehurst?
You saw something, didn't you?
You saw Chucky.
Don't wimp out on me!
I need your help.
That kid needs your help.
I didn't see anything.
Okay?
I didn't see anything at all.
Your left, right, your left.
Your military left.
Ellis, let's make sure all the perimeters are secure.
Yes, sir.
She checks the windows.
And the baby-sitter hears this thump, thump, thumping.
Like something's being dragged across the floor upstairs.
Suddenly she thinks, "I haven't checked on the children."
So she hurries to the top of the stairs, and when she gets there... she sees her boyfriend completely dismembered, dragging himself across the floor by his chin.
Thump, slide.
Thump, slide.
- Thump, slide.
- That was gross.
Hey, you guys, I got a better story... and it's true.
It's about this mental institution... and it's a few miles away from here.
Hey.
Hope it wasn't something I said.
No.
I'm sorry.
Where do you think the red team's camped out?
Could be any here.
Shelton'll find 'em, he always does.
By the way, you can call me Kristin.
What?
Kristin.
It's my first name.
Do you have one?
Andy.
Come on, Andy.
I want to show you something.
Pretty cool, huh?
Yeah, I almost forgot there were places like that... where people just go to have fun.
Listen!
Somebody's out there.
It's probably just a chipmunk or something.
Nothing scares you, does it?
No.
Man, I gotta get out of this body.
I'm going after Tyler.
Are you crazy?
You'll never find him.
Wanna bet?
I swiped this from Shelton's tent.
He sent out a reconnaissance mission right before we pitched camp.
The red team is somewhere around here.
That kid's a sitting duck, Whitehurst.
Are you with me... or not?
I'm sorry, I can't.
Up and at 'em, ladies.
We're movin' out.
I want this camp to be a ghost town in five minutes.
I thought we weren't going till dawn, sir.
Someone stole the reconnaissance map, so we're making Our move now.
Get going, Hanley.
You wouldn't know anything about a missing map, would you?
Where the hell's Barclay?
Whitehurst!
Colonel Shelton, you better have a look in here, sir.
What is it, Ellis?
Barclay's gone AWOL, sir.
He stole the map.
That little fucking traitor's doubling for the reds.
Where's Tyler?
He went AWOL with some guy named Charles.
Where's Andy?
Whitehurst, where is he?
Platoon, halt!
All right.
De Silva, you're gonna take the right flank.
Siegel, take the left.
Check in on the radio every five minutes.
Yes, sir.
All right, move it.
The rest of us are gonna spread out and meet up with Ellis at Split Rock.
Move out.
Whitehurst, move!
Thanks for coming after me.
What are friends for?
Duck!
That was a close one.
Now we can play "Hide the Soul."
I'm tired.
I don't wanna play that dumb game anymore.
You're a fuckin' drag, you know that?
- Watch your mouth, Charles.
- Stop calling me that!
What's the knife for?
A good soldier is always prepared.
Barclay w_s right.
You're not a good guy.
Sorry kid.
You got me.
I'm bad.
Now... assume the position.
No!
Aaah!
Get back here!
Barclay!
Barclay!
Tyler!
You fuckin' traitor.
Give me my map!
Listen -
- You got any idea what we do to traitors, Barclay?
Tyler's in trouble.
Whitehurst, back me up.
Major Ellis, call in the flanks.
Yes, sir.
De Silva, Siegel, do you copy?
De Silva, do you copy?
De Silva, come in.
Aaah!
Siegel's on his way back.
No word yet from De Silva.
Keep trying'.
Yes, sir.
Help!
Tyler!
Barclay!
Are you okay, Tyler?
Looks like we got ourselves a little P.O.W. You're right,
Charles is bad.
He tried to hurt me.
Who the hell's Charles?
Come in, Barclay.
Who the hell is that?
It's Charles.
Who is this?
Put Barclay on, jarhead.
It's the reds.
They're up to something.
What do you want?
I want the kid.
Bring him up to the old Jeep or there'll be hell to pay.
Andy, don't do it.
De Silva!
You hear that, Barclay?
Don't touch her, you son of a bitch.
Now bring me the kid or I'll waste her.
Red team, red team.
come in, red team.
This is red team, over.
We got a situation up here at the old Jeep.
Blue team sighted.
Advise you to move your troops in.
Hope they like the taste of lead.
Now just sit back and watch the sparks fly.
All right, you two are gonna go on up ahead.
The rest of us are gonna circle around.
Shelton, this is no game.
This guy is dangerous.
Relax, Barclay, it's only paint.
All right, let's do it.
I'm scared, Barclay.
Yeah, me too.
All right, kid.
Get over here!
No!
Don't fuck with me!
I'll blow all of you to pieces.
Beat it!
Now just get down and shut up.
Yeah!
Ow!
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
De Silva, where the hell is everybody?
Hi, soldier.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Fuck me.
All right!
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Shit!
Stay down!
They're using live rounds!
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Oh, God, he's not breathing!
Get away from him!
You did this, didn't you?
You sick son of a bitch.
Now I'm gonna kill you!
Get off me!
Get off of him, he didn't do it!
Let go of me!
"Sayonara", suckers.
Look out!
No!
- Oh, my God, what happened?
- It's Whitehurst.
What the hell happened?
Who fucked with the rifles?
I don't know.
Get Clark on the radio...
Yes, sir.
and get me a medic up here right now!
All right, everybody stay calm.
Epstein, I want that radio!
Oh, God.
This is the last time I'm gonna tell you.
Give that thing a rest or you're out of here, both of you.
We're not bothering anybody.
You're bothering me.
Keep it down!
Geez!
Mister, you gotta help me!
What's wrong?
Charles, Charles he's after me.
Who's Charles?
He's a Good Guy.
He wants to play "Hide the Soul."
Have a seat over there.
Are you from Kent?
Yes, sir.
What's your name, son?
Ronald Tyler.
Private first class, sir.
Have a seat.
How 'bout some gum, Private?
I know how it must hurt... when a friend does something bad to you.
Sure does.
But I bet your friend -- what's his name, Charles?
I bet you Charles didn't mean it.
I bet you he's really sorry.
No, he isn't.
He wants to hurt me.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
I know what'll cheer you up.
Look what I found.
There you go.
Thank you, Daddy.
Let's go on the Super Loop.
Hey, maybe somebody's seen him.
Oh, God.
Come on.
Wait.
Mommy, Mommy, I loved it!
Were you scared?
No!
No!
Let's have some popcorn and we'll go on one more ride.
Perfect.
In there.
Don't even think about it.
Come on.
Okay.
ln there!
Aaah!
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Oh!
Time to play.
This looks good.

Aaah!
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Shit!
Ha.
Tyler!
Barclay, Barclay, in here!
He's got a gun!
Shit!
Aaah!
Are you okay?
Oh, God.
Here... take it.
You can do it.
I'll be okay.
Help!
Help!
Yeah!
You're mine now, Tyler.
Oh, God!
- Aaah!
- Aaah!
- Tyler!
- Barclay!
Tyler, watch out!
Shit!
This is it, kid.

Come on, let's get out of here.
Hold on, Tyler!
Gimme the fuckin' kid.
He's mine!
He's mine!
Gimme the fuckin' kid.
Hold on!
He's mine!
Barclay!
Take the knife!
Take it.
Here!
Hold on!
Reach for it!
No!
Ahhh!
Come on, I got ya.
We're on our way in.
You'll have to come with us now, son.
Are you gonna be okay?
Don't worry.
I've been here before.
Watch your head.
This is Andy Barclay.
Eight years ago he touched off the scandal... that nearly crippled this company, claiming that his Good Guy doll, Chucky, was possessed by...
Charles Lee Ray, the notorious Lakeshore Strangler.
Now I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, after the lawsuits and negative publicity, when the company is finally getting back on its feet, where is the wisdom in putting the Good Guy back on the market?
Mr. Sullivan, before this happened... the Good Guy outsold our other toys 2 to 1 .
Even now, interest in the marketplace is at its peak.
The factory is up and running again.
We should be in stores by next week.
We cannot let the fantasies of one disturbed boy... influence company policy.
What if the doll somehow... affects another child in a negative way?
You could have a public relations nightmare.
One of the hardest things about this business is... that it is a business.
Doesn't matter what we're selling.
Whether it's cars nuclear weapons ..
or yes, even toys.
The bottom line is the bottom line.
And what are children but consumer trainees?
Andy Barclay is ancient history.
No one remembers him.
Nobody cares.
I have made up my mind.
We're moving ahead.
Thank you.
Okay.
All right.
Mr. Sullivan.
if there's nothing I can say to convince you, then I must go on record.
I'm completely against this.
Your position is crystal clear, Miles.
And you can be sure I won't forget.
Just a minute, folks.
Mr. Sullivan, we have a surprise.
Guys at the factory sent this over.
First off the assembly line, the Good Guy of the '90s.
If there's nothing else, I'm gonna get going.
Fine. it's just, my wife's expecting me.
It's our anniversary.
Fine, Petzold.
I could review the Larrabee report after dinner.
Good night, Mr. Sullivan.
Good night.
Ahh.
Despite a downdraft in the bond market, stocks were able to post a rally on friday... thanks to a couple of different factors.
Not only did the employment report allay recession fears, but also there was a technical rebound in buying... and a resurgence in deal stocks helped set the tone.
Here's a look at the numbers.
The Dow industrial's up 1 6.
The transportation average up 3.
Utilities bouncing up--
Utilities bouncing up--
In a moment's time --
Oh, shit.
Bonds headed south on the economic data, which served to bolster the U.S. dollar.
The dollar index up a quarter point.
The CRB index up... point 43 at two-thirty point 43.
March crude up...
Hi, my name is Larry.
Hi, my name is Pauly.
- Hey, wanna play?
- Hey, wanna play?
- I like to be hugged.
- I like to be hugged.
Hi, my name is Larry.
Hi, my name is Pauly.
Hey, wanna play?
Hey, wanna play?
I like to be hugged.
I like to be hugged.
Hi, my name is Larry.
Hi, my name is Pauly.
Hey, wanna play?
Hey, wanna play?
I like to be --
Don't fuck with the Chuck.
Oh, my God.
Just like the good old days.
Nothing like a strangulation to get the circulation going.
You're my only ticket out of here, Andy.
I gotta get out of this goddamn body.
Where are you, you little shit?
Inward hut.
Come on, come on.
Yeah,you can do it.
You can do it, Jackson, hurry up.
Come on, let's go.
Yeah, come on.
Get moving.
Go to the end of the line.
Left, left Left, left.
I see for the past eight years... you've been in one foster home after another.
Mind if I ask why?
They took me away from my mother.
She's under special care.
I know that.
How come you never got settled an_here?
Adjustment problems.
I can read, Barclay.
I'm asking you.
I never felt comfortable with those people.
They weren't family.
They were strangers.
All right, listen up, Barclay.
I'm willing to cut you some slack, because you've had it rough.
But you're a troublemaker.
And I got a problem with troublemakers.
They don't fit into the system.
So here's my advice.
Grow up!
You're not a kid anymore.
It's time to forget these fantasies of killer dolls.
Yes, sir.
"When I was a child,
"I thought as a child.
"When I became a man,
I put away childish things."
First Corinthians.
Look alive.
On your feet.
At Kent, we take bed wetters and turn 'em into men.
Oh, yes.
Yes, oh.
Yes, we're seeing some skin now, aren't we?
Presto, you're bald.
Always feels weird at first.
Next.
Kiss it good-bye.
The Romans invented the military cut.
You know why?
Why?
To keep their hair short, so their enemies couldn't grab it in battle... and slit their throat.
Ha, ha, ha.
Now hold still.
Oh, shit.
Ha, ha, ha.
We're back and we're better than ever.
No one will play with me.
Uh-oh, there's a friend in need.
Hey, cheer up.
Who are you?
I'm a Good Guy.
Good Guy, Good Guy, Good Guy!
I've just come from the Good Guy clubhouse... and I'll be your friend to the end.
You will?
Wow.
Sure I will.
Hi-de-ho.
All aboard for high-flying fun with me, your friend to the end, the Good Guy doll from Play Pals.
Are you okay?
Bastards!
Fucking bastards!
What happened?
Shelton!
That's what happened!
Shelton and his goddamn lackeys.
Thank you.
I'm fine.
I'm Andy.
You must be new.
Otherwise... you'd know they don't tolerate individuality, nothing as personal as a first name.
Right.
I forgot.
- Barclay.
- Whitehurst.
Harold Aubrey, for the record.
So, who's this Shelton?
Cadet lieutenant Colonel Brett C. Shelton.
He's God around here.
Don't expect mercy from him.
Welcome to hell, Barclay.
All present and accounted for, sir.
Thank you, Major Ellis.
You're new boy, huh?
Yeah.
How you doing?
Pretty good.
Who said you could look at me?
Do you know who I am?
Shelton?
That's Lieutenant Colonel Shelton to you, asshole!
Lieutenant Colonel Shelton.
Lieutenant Colonel...
Shelton... sir.
Lieutenant Colonel Shelton, sir.
-What's your name, dipweed?
- Barclay.
- Sir.
- Louder.
- Louder!
- Sir!
That's much better, new boy.
That's much better.
Shit, Whitehurst.
You are without a doubt... the most pathetic thing I have ever seen!
Wouldn't you agree?
I asked you a question, nimrod.
No, sir!
I don't agree, sir!
Are you contradicting me, you sorry-ass sack of shit?
You asshole.
- What did you say?
- I said, "You asshole;' sir!
Think you're pretty funny, don't you, De Silva?
Yes, I do, sir.
Drop and give me 25.
Right now.
25 what, sir?
25 push-ups, De Silva.
One, sir!
Two, sir!
Three, sir!
You women might think... that because you're so much more delicate... you deserve special treatment... and once a month... we're gonna get out of your way.
You can forget it!
13, sir!
14, sir!
The same rules apply for everybody.
18, sir!
Only the fittest survive.
22, sir!
23, sir!
One-handed.
24, sir!
25... sir!
Recover.
How you doing, Tyler?
Sorry, nothing from your dad.
Maybe tomorrow.
Listen, he's busy flying jets, defending the county.
He'll write when he gets a chance.
I know.
Hey!
I got a job for you.
Give this to the new kid for me.
- Barclay.
- Yes, sir.
That a boy.
Out of the way.
Watch it, kid.
Hey!
Look out!
A Good Guy.
Who the fuck are you?
I thought you guys only said three sentences.
I'm new and improved.
I never saw a doll like you before.
All right, kid.
Fun's over.
Where the hell's Andy?
Andy?
Can't you read?
He was supposed to get this package.
Tampering with the mail is a federal offense.
Sorry.
Is he your best friend?
He's more than that.
He's my new lease on life.
Wait a minute.
I got a new body... and I ain't told anyone about my little secret yet.
So, what's your name, kid?
Tyler.
What's yours?
Chucky.
But my real name... is Charles Lee Ray.
Whitehurst, what am I doing wrong?
ls there anything you can't do?
Yeah.
I can't get thrown out of this place.
Barclay, meet De Silva.
Hi.
Hi.
So, you want to show me?
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
No, put the elbow like that.
And like this.
No.
Keep both eyes open.
Keep your sights on the target.
Hold your breath.
Squeeze the trigger.
Don't pull it.
You're not concentrating.
It was great what you did for us at formation.
Shelton's a major dick.
Tell me about it.
Hold still.
What do you call this game?
"Hide the Soul." Trust me, you're gonna love it.
Whatever you say, Charles.
Ade due...
Damballa!
Give me the power, I beg of you!
Leveau mercier du bois chaloitte... secoisse entienne mais pois de--
- Shit!
- Charles, stop swearing.
We're gonna need the Springfield aught-threes...
Yes, sir.
Marked for both the red team and the blue team.
What are you doing, Tyler?
We're playing "Hide the Soul."
I'll catch up with you.
I'll start loading the paint guns.
We don't play with dolls, do we?
Dolls are for girls.
But Charles is my new best friend.
You know better than to talk back to a superior.
Yes, sir.
Clean that up.
I'll take care of this.
I'll be back!
Left, left Left, right, left.
Left, left.
Get that weapon up, Barclay.
Platoon, halt.
Left face.
New boy!
Fall out.
Fall out!
Order, hut.
Port... arms!
Right shoulder... arms!
Left shoulder... arms.
Right shoulder, arms.
left shoulder, arms.
Port arms.
Left shoulder, arms.
Port arms.
Right shoulder, arms.
Port arms.
Barclay!
It's not a baton, Barclay.
You look like a goddamn majorette over here.
I'm not used to guns, sir.
Does this look like a gun to you, Barclay?
It's a rifle.
- Major Ellis!
- Sir!
Show the new boy the difference.
This is my rifle.
This is my gun.
This is for shooting and this is for fun.
A soldier's rifle is his best friend.
Remember that.
Stop!
Shit!
Help!
Please, mister!
Please, somebody!
Jesus!
I'm stuck, mister!
I'm in here!
Hold on!
I'm coming!
Where are you?
I'm coming.
Yell!
Make a noise!
Where are ya?
Oh, my God!
No, stop!
Stop!
fall out!
You get back there.
Finish unpacking.
Shelton's notorious for surprise inspections.
What are you doing?
What's it look like?
I'm polishing Shelton's shoes.
He makes you polish his shoes?
No, I offered out of the kindness of my heart.
Whitehurst, did you see Cochrane with that doll today?
No, what doll?
He was carrying a Good Guy doll... just before the accident with the garbage truck.
Good Guys.
I remember those.
Yeah, me too.
Lights out in a few minutes.
I'm gonna go get washed up.
I almost forgot.
Sgt. Clark wanted to know if you got that package.
What package?
He said you got a package in the mail.
Tyler was supposed to bring it to you.
Didn't you get it?
No.
Who would have sent me a package?
Hey, long time no see, pal!
No, you're dead!
We killed you!
You know what they say.
"You just can't keep a good guy down."
Andy, how you've grown.
You're not gonna kill me.
You need to transfer your soul.
Wrong again, wimp.
I got some fresh meat lined up.
I'm not gonna let you spoil it this time.
- Tyler?
- Yeah.
Just think.
Chucky's gonna be a "bro."
I'm not gonna let you get away with this.
I'm not gonna let you near that kid.
Agh!
What's the matter?
You homesick?
You miss your mommy?
What the fuck is this?
I'm sorry about your shoe.
I'll polish it.
Give me back the doll.
No, you listen to me.
Tell Whitehurst he's off the hook.
I got myself another slave.
Clean up this mess.
You got five demerits.
What about the doll?
My kid sister's birthday's coming up.
I think she's gonna Cove it, don't you?
Oh, shit.
Andy.
What the fuck?
No, stop!
What the fuck you doing in my room?
You wouldn't believe me.
Where's the doll Barclay?
Where's the fucking doll?
You took it, didn't you?
No!
What's going on?
Somebody sure as hell took it.
It's almost midnight.
Is this necessary?
I'm tying to weed out a thief. sir.
You've always told me how important it is... to uphold the school's code of honor.
All right, make your point.
But I want everybody back in at 01.00 hours.
Yes, sir.
By the time we get through with Barclay, he's gonna be living in a world full of shit.
We got an hour, so let's make it count.
Yes, sir.
Ladies, get those weapons in the air.
I want to see them high.
Higher!
I think I'm gonna throw up.
You're dead, new boy.
fucking geek.
"Dear Charles, you're it.
Come and find me.
Your best friend."
Shit!
Charles.
Come and find me.
Goddamn it.
- Platoon!
- Hut.
Double time!
Hut.
Knees up, ladies.
Whitehurst, where do the kids sleep?
Above the portico.
You're wearing combat boots, not ballet slippers!
Come on, move it Barclay.
it's gonna get worse than this.
Get the lead out.
Come on, move it.
Faster, faster.
Get those knees in the sky.
You son of a bitch!
Hell of a punch there, Barclay.
Now I'll see what kind of a tough guy you are.
Get your head around here.
Tyler, come out, come out, wherever you are.
Dolly dolly oxen free!
Get out here, you little son of a bitch!
Three!
You're not sounding of_
Four!
Five!
All right, Barclay.
You got me curious.
What are you tying to prove?
Forget it.
I want to know.
All right.
The doll's alive.
- He's after Tyler.
- Right, forget it.
I hope he can take care of himself.
Shh, shh.
Quiet.
Shut up!
I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
Just stay here and keep an eye out.
Oh, I live for this.
I know, Ivers.
Now go, go.
Shh, shh.
I don't see what you see in that guy.
He's just different from everybody else.
Oh, please.
Well, he's cute too.
Okay.
foster homes.
No wonder he's so quiet.
What was that?
So, you took the doll?
Shelton will have you court-martialed.
We're playing hide-and-seek.
What are you doing?
We couldn't sleep.
Oh, he is... so cute.
He was mine first.
Give him back.
Shh, you guys.
Please be quiet!
Can you go stand guard?
Yes, sir.
What's his name?
Ask him yourself.
Oh, right.
What is your name?
Hi, I'm Chucky and I'm your friend to the end.
Hi-de-ho.
Ha, ha.
I love it.
His real name is Charles Lee Ray.
Oh, is that so?
Give me your lipstick.
What for?
Just give it to me.
What are you doing?
Wait, stop.
You'll see.
Here you go, little baby.
You're messing him up.
You're so cute.
Don't do that.
He looks stupid!
You're making him look like a wuss!
He looks sweet.
What are you doing?
Someone's coming.
Come on, let's go.
Come on.
Wait.
Stop!
What about Charles?
Yuck!
This means war.
What the hell?
- I like to be hugged.
- Go--Jesus!
Aaah!
Aw, you gotta be fucking kidding' me.
The man lives through two tours in Nam... and then one night he just drops dead.
Doesn't make any sense.
At ease.
We will now take a moment of silence to honor Colonel Cochrane.
He was a fine man and he will be sorely missed.
Bow your heads for prayer.
Take... seats!
It's gettin' pretty shaggy, Carlson.
I want to see you on Friday.
Yes, sir.
Monday, Fabrizzio.
Yes, sir.
My man.
Tuesday.
Look at you, Whitehurst.
You're a disgrace.
When's the last time you had a trim?
Two weeks ago, Sergeant, I think.
You think?
I want to see you right after breakfast.
Yes, sir, Sergeant Botnick, sir.
What're you looking at, new boy?
Wednesday.
Barclay, what're you doing?
You can't just get up in the middle of mess.
Major.
At ease!
Tyler.
Hi, Barclay.
What's up?
I've got to talk to you about Chucky.
You mean Charles.
Have you seen him?
Not since last night.
He's hiding somewhere.
He's gonna lay low until he knows you're alone, and he's gonna come after you.
He wants to play.
Listen to me.
No matter what he says, no matter what he promises you, you've gotta stay away from him.
Don't let him fool you.
He's bad.
Charles isn't bad, he's a Good Guy.
It says so on his shirt.
He lies, Tyler.
Believe me, he's bad news.
He's hurt a lot of people.
I think Colonel Cochrane was one of them.
You're just jealous because he's my best friend now instead of yours.
Look, you better keep this.
Whitehurst, you are, without a doubt the sorriest excuse for a soldier to ever disgrace these walls.
Face it, you're not cut out for this life.
Why don't you do yourself a favor and get the hell out of Kent?
If I had any choice in the matter, I would, sir.
Smart ass.
Presto... you're bald.
What the hell?
How'd you get in there?
That haircut ain't regulation, soldier.
When's the last time you had a trim, huh?
Kiss it good-bye.
Presto...
you're dead.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
It's definitely you.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
I just forgot my --
Boo!
The annual war games... have been an unbroken tradition here at Kent for over 50 years.
Colonel Cochrane was a man who believed in tradition.
He not only would have wanted us to go on, he'd have ordered us to go on.
Therefore... the war games.... will proceed as scheduled.
Lieutenant Colonel Shelton... will command the blue team.
Major Rawlings will head up the reds.
The objective is simple.
To capture the other team's flag... and bring it back here safely to base.
Rawlings.
You will pick up your weapons... in the armory before moving out.
You will be using the standard issue Springfield aught-three.
Your ammo--
Shelton.
If you get hit, you are dead.
Hike back to base.
Commanders... take charge of your teams.
May the best team win.
Good luck, men and women.
Nice of you to join us.
Looks like Botnick's in a pretty bad mood today.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing's wrong.
I'm fine.
Nothing's wrong.
This oughta slow the pricks down.
left, left, left.
Her ewe go again.
Here we go again.
Same old stuff again.
Same old stuff again.
Marching down the avenue.
Marching down the avenue.
Two more miles and we'll be through.
Two more miles and we'll be through.
I'll be gettin' rid of you.
I'll be gettin' rid of you.
Same old ugly stuff.
Same old ugly stuff.
Her ewe go again.
Her ewe go again.
Marching down the avenue.
Marching down the avenue.
One more mile and we'll be through.
One more mile and we'll be through.
I'll be gettin' rid of you.
What's going on, Whitehurst?
You saw something, didn't you?
You saw Chucky.
Don't wimp out on me!
I need your help.
That kid needs your help.
I didn't see anything.
Okay?
I didn't see anything at all.
Your left, right, your left.
Your military left.
Ellis, let's make sure all the perimeters are secure.
Yes, sir.
She checks the windows.
And the baby-sitter hears this thump, thump, thumping.
Like something's being dragged across the floor upstairs.
Suddenly she thinks, "I haven't checked on the children."
So she hurries to the top of the stairs, and when she gets there... she sees her boyfriend completely dismembered, dragging himself across the floor by his chin.
Thump, slide.
Thump, slide.
- Thump, slide.
- That was gross.
Hey, you guys, I got a better story... and it's true.
It's about this mental institution... and it's a few miles away from here.
Hey.
Hope it wasn't something I said.
No.
I'm sorry.
Where do you think the red team's camped out?
Could be any here.
Shelton'll find 'em, he always does.
By the way, you can call me Kristin.
What?
Kristin.
It's my first name.
Do you have one?
Andy.
Come on, Andy.
I want to show you something.
Pretty cool, huh?
Yeah, I almost forgot there were places like that... where people just go to have fun.
Listen!
Somebody's out there.
It's probably just a chipmunk or something.
Nothing scares you, does it?
No.
Man, I gotta get out of this body.
I'm going after Tyler.
Are you crazy?
You'll never find him.
Wanna bet?
I swiped this from Shelton's tent.
He sent out a reconnaissance mission right before we pitched camp.
The red team is somewhere around here.
That kid's a sitting duck, Whitehurst.
Are you with me... or not?
I'm sorry, I can't.
Up and at 'em, ladies.
We're movin' out.
I want this camp to be a ghost town in five minutes.
I thought we weren't going till dawn, sir.
Someone stole the reconnaissance map, so we're making Our move now.
Get going, Hanley.
You wouldn't know anything about a missing map, would you?
Where the hell's Barclay?
Whitehurst!
Colonel Shelton, you better have a look in here, sir.
What is it, Ellis?
Barclay's gone AWOL, sir.
He stole the map.
That little fucking traitor's doubling for the reds.
Where's Tyler?
He went AWOL with some guy named Charles.
Where's Andy?
Whitehurst, where is he?
Platoon, halt!
All right.
De Silva, you're gonna take the right flank.
Siegel, take the left.
Check in on the radio every five minutes.
Yes, sir.
All right, move it.
The rest of us are gonna spread out and meet up with Ellis at Split Rock.
Move out.
Whitehurst, move!
Thanks for coming after me.
What are friends for?
Duck!
That was a close one.
Now we can play "Hide the Soul."
I'm tired.
I don't wanna play that dumb game anymore.
You're a fuckin' drag, you know that?
- Watch your mouth, Charles.
- Stop calling me that!
What's the knife for?
A good soldier is always prepared.
Barclay w_s right.
You're not a good guy.
Sorry kid.
You got me.
I'm bad.
Now... assume the position.
No!
Aaah!
Get back here!
Barclay!
Barclay!
Tyler!
You fuckin' traitor.
Give me my map!
Listen -
- You got any idea what we do to traitors, Barclay?
Tyler's in trouble.
Whitehurst, back me up.
Major Ellis, call in the flanks.
Yes, sir.
De Silva, Siegel, do you copy?
De Silva, do you copy?
De Silva, come in.
Aaah!
Siegel's on his way back.
No word yet from De Silva.
Keep trying'.
Yes, sir.
Help!
Tyler!
Barclay!
Are you okay, Tyler?
Looks like we got ourselves a little P.O.W. You're right,
Charles is bad.
He tried to hurt me.
Who the hell's Charles?
Come in, Barclay.
Who the hell is that?
It's Charles.
Who is this?
Put Barclay on, jarhead.
It's the reds.
They're up to something.
What do you want?
I want the kid.
Bring him up to the old Jeep or there'll be hell to pay.
Andy, don't do it.
De Silva!
You hear that, Barclay?
Don't touch her, you son of a bitch.
Now bring me the kid or I'll waste her.
Red team, red team.
come in, red team.
This is red team, over.
We got a situation up here at the old Jeep.
Blue team sighted.
Advise you to move your troops in.
Hope they like the taste of lead.
Now just sit back and watch the sparks fly.
All right, you two are gonna go on up ahead.
The rest of us are gonna circle around.
Shelton, this is no game.
This guy is dangerous.
Relax, Barclay, it's only paint.
All right, let's do it.
I'm scared, Barclay.
Yeah, me too.
All right, kid.
Get over here!
No!
Don't fuck with me!
I'll blow all of you to pieces.
Beat it!
Now just get down and shut up.
Yeah!
Ow!
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
De Silva, where the hell is everybody?
Hi, soldier.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Fuck me.
All right!
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Shit!
Stay down!
They're using live rounds!
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Oh, God, he's not breathing!
Get away from him!
You did this, didn't you?
You sick son of a bitch.
Now I'm gonna kill you!
Get off me!
Get off of him, he didn't do it!
Let go of me!
Savonarola, suckers.
Look out!
No!
- Oh, my God, what happened?
- It's Whitehurst.
What the hell happened?
Who fucked with the rifles?
I don't know.
Get Clark on the radio...
Yes, sir.
and get me a medic up here right now!
All right, everybody stay calm.
Epstein, I want that radio!
Oh, God.
This is the last time I'm gonna tell you.
Give that thing a rest or you're out of here, both of you.
We're not bothering anybody.
You're bothering me.
Keep it down!
Geez!
Mister, you gotta help me!
What's wrong?
Charles, Charles he's after me.
Who's Charles?
He's a Good Guy.
He wants to play "Hide the Soul."
Have a seat over there.
Are you from Kent?
Yes, sir.
What's your name, son?
Ronald Tyler.
Private first class, sir.
Have a seat.
How 'bout some gum, Private?
I know how it must hurt... when a friend does something bad to you.
Sure does.
But I bet your friend -- what's his name, Charles?
I bet you Charles didn't mean it.
I bet you he's really sorry.
No, he isn't.
He wants to hurt me.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
I know what'll cheer you up.
Look what I found.
There you go.
Thank you, Daddy.
Let's go on the Super Loop.
Hey, maybe somebody's seen him.
Oh, God.
Come on.
Wait.
Mommy, Mommy, I loved it!
Were you scared?
No!
No!
Let's have some popcorn and we'll go on one more ride.
Perfect.
In there.
Don't even think about it.
Come on.
Okay.

Aaah!
Ha-ha-ha-ha!
Oh!
Time to play.
This looks good.

He's got a gun!
Shit!
Aaah!
Are you okay?
Oh, God.

You can do it.
I'll be okay.
Help!
Help!
Yeah!
You're mine now, Tyler.
Oh, God!

Come on, I got ya.
We're on our way in.
You'll have to come with us now, son.
Are you gonna be okay?
Don't worry.
I've been here before.
Watch your head.
This is Andy Barclay.
Eight years ago he touched off the scandal... that nearly crippled this company, claiming that his Good Guy doll, Chucky, was possessed by...
Charles Lee Ray, the notorious Lakeshore Strangler.
Now I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, after the lawsuits and negative publicity, when the company is finally getting back on its feet, where is the wisdom in putting the Good Guy back on the market?
Mr. Sullivan, before this happened... the Good Guy outsold our other toys 2 to 1 .
Even now, interest in the marketplace is at its peak.
The factory is up and running again.
We should be in stores by next week.
We cannot let the fantasies of one disturbed boy... influence company policy.
What if the doll somehow... affects another child in a negative way?
You could have a public relations nightmare.
One of the hardest things about this business is... that it is a business.
Doesn't matter what we're selling.
Whether it's cars nuclear weapons ..
or yes, even toys.
The bottom line is the bottom line.
And what are children but consumer trainees?
Andy Barclay is ancient history.
No one remembers him.
Nobody cares.
I have made up my mind.
We're moving ahead.
Thank you.
Okay.
All right.
Mr. Sullivan.
if there's nothing I can say to convince you, then I must go on record.
I'm completely against this.
Your position is crystal clear, Miles.
And you can be sure I won't forget.
Just a minute, folks.
Mr. Sullivan, we have a surprise.
Guys at the factory sent this over.
First off the assembly line, the Good Guy of the '90s.
If there's nothing else, I'm gonna get going.
Fine. it's just, my wife's expecting me.
It's our anniversary.
Fine, Petzold.
I could review the Larrabee report after dinner.
Good night, Mr. Sullivan.
Good night.
Ahh.
Despite a downdraft in the bond market, stocks were able to post a rally on friday... thanks to a couple of different factors.
Not only did the employment report allay recession fears, but also there was a technical rebound in buying... and a resurgence in deal stocks helped set the tone.
Here's a look at the numbers.
The Dow industrial's up 1 6.
The transportation average up 3.
Utilities bouncing up--
Utilities bouncing up--
In a moment's time --
Oh, shit.
Bonds headed south on the economic data, which served to bolster the U.S. dollar.
The dollar index up a quarter point.
The CRB index up... point 43 at two-thirty point 43.
March crude up...
Hi, my name is Larry.
Hi, my name is Pauly.
- Hey, wanna play?
- Hey, wanna play?
- I like to be hugged.
- I like to be hugged.
Hi, my name is Larry.
Hi, my name is Pauly.

I like to be hugged.
Hi, my name is Larry.
Hi, my name is Pauly.
Hey, wanna play?
Hey, wanna play?
I like to be --
Don't fuck with the Chuck.
Oh, my God.
Just like the good old days.
Nothing like a strangulation to get the circulation going.
You're my only ticket out of here, Andy.
I gotta get out of this goddamn body.
Where are you, you little shit?
Inward hut.
Come on, come on.
Yeah,you can do it.
You can do it, Jackson, hurry up.
Come on, let's go.
Yeah, come on.
Get moving.
Go to the end of the line.
Left, left Left, left.
I see for the past eight years... you've been in one foster home after another.
Mind if I ask why?
They took me away from my mother.
She's under special care.
I know that.
How come you never got settled an_here?
Adjustment problems.
I can read, Barclay.
I'm asking you.
I never felt comfortable with those people.
They weren't family.
They were strangers.
All right, listen up, Barclay.
I'm willing to cut you some slack, because you've had it rough.
But you're a troublemaker.
And I got a problem with troublemakers.
They don't fit into the system.
So here's my advice.
Grow up!
You're not a kid anymore.
It's time to forget these fantasies of killer dolls.
Yes, sir.
"When I was a child,
"I thought as a child.
"When I became a man,
I put away childish things."
First Corinthians.
Look alive.
On your feet.
At Kent, we take bed wetters and turn 'em into men.
Oh, yes.
Yes, oh.
Yes, we're seeing some skin now, aren't we?
Presto, you're bald.
Always feels weird at first.
Next.
Kiss it good-bye.
The Romans invented the military cut.
You know why?
Why?
To keep their hair short, so their enemies couldn't grab it in battle... and slit their throat.
Ha, ha, ha.
Now hold still.
Oh, shit.
Ha, ha, ha.
We're back and we're better than ever.
No one will play with me.
Uh-oh, there's a friend in need.
Hey, cheer up.
Who are you?
I'm a Good Guy.
Good Guy, Good Guy, Good Guy!
I've just come from the Good Guy clubhouse... and I'll be your friend to the end.
You will?
Wow.
Sure I will.
Hi-de-ho.
All aboard for high-flying fun with me, your friend to the end, the Good Guy doll from Play Pals.
Are you okay?
Bastards!
Fucking bastards!
What happened?
Shelton!
That's what happened!
Shelton and his goddamn lackeys.
Thank you.
I'm fine.
I'm Andy.
You must be new.
Otherwise... you'd know they don't tolerate individuality, nothing as personal as a first name.
Right.
I forgot.
- Barclay.
- Whitehurst.
Harold Aubrey, for the record.
So, who's this Shelton?
Cadet lieutenant Colonel Brett C. Shelton.
He's God around here.
Don't expect mercy from him.
Welcome to hell, Barclay.
All present and accounted for, sir.
Thank you, Major Ellis.
You're new boy, huh?
Yeah.
How you doing?
Pretty good.
Who said you could look at me?
Do you know who I am?
Shelton?
That's Lieutenant Colonel Shelton to you, asshole!
Lieutenant Colonel Shelton.
Lieutenant Colonel...
Shelton... sir.
Lieutenant Colonel Shelton, sir.
-What's your name, dipweed?
- Barclay.
- Sir.
- Louder.
- Louder!
- Sir!
That's much better, new boy.
That's much better.
Shit, Whitehurst.
You are without a doubt... the most pathetic thing I have ever seen!
Wouldn't you agree?
I asked you a question, nimrod.
No, sir!
I don't agree, sir!
Are you contradicting me, you sorry-ass sack of shit?
You asshole.
- What did you say?
- I said, "You asshole;' sir!
Think you're pretty funny, don't you, De Silva?
Yes, I do, sir.
Drop and give me 25.
Right now.
25 what, sir?
25 push-ups, De Silva.
One, sir!
Two, sir!
Three, sir!
You women might think... that because you're so much more delicate... you deserve special treatment... and once a month... we're gonna get out of your way.
You can forget it!
13, sir!
14, sir!
The same rules apply for everybody.
18, sir!
Only the fittest survive.
22, sir!
23, sir!
One-handed.
24, sir!
25... sir!
Recover.
How you doing, Tyler?
Sorry, nothing from your dad.
Maybe tomorrow.
Listen, he's busy flying jets, defending the county.
He'll write when he gets a chance.
I know.
Hey!
I got a job for you.
Give this to the new kid for me.
- Barclay.
- Yes, sir.
That a boy.
Out of the way.
Watch it, kid.
Hey!
Look out!
A Good Guy.
Who the fuck are you?
I thought you guys only said three sentences.
I'm new and improved.
I never saw a doll like you before.
All right, kid.
Fun's over.
Where the hell's Andy?
Andy?
Can't you read?
He was supposed to get this package.
Tampering with the mail is a federal offense.
Sorry.
Is he your best friend?
He's more than that.
He's my new lease on life.
Wait a minute.
I got a new body... and I ain't told anyone about my little secret yet.
So, what's your name, kid?
Tyler.
What's yours?
Chucky.
But my real name... is Charles Lee Ray.
Whitehurst, what am I doing wrong?
ls there anything you can't do?
Yeah.
I can't get thrown out of this place.
Barclay, meet De Silva.
Hi.
Hi.
So, you want to show me?
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
No, put the elbow like that.
And like this.
No.
Keep both eyes open.
Keep your sights on the target.
Hold your breath.
Squeeze the trigger.
Don't pull it.
You're not concentrating.
It was great what you did for us at formation.
Shelton's a major dick.
Tell me about it.
Hold still.
What do you call this game?
"Hide the Soul." Trust me, you're gonna love it.
Whatever you say, Charles.
Ade due...
Damballa!
Give me the power, I beg of you!
Leveau mercier du bois chaloitte... secoisse entienne mais pois de--
- Shit!
- Charles, stop swearing.
We're gonna need the Springfield aught-threes...
Yes, sir.
Marked for both the red team and the blue team.
What are you doing, Tyler?
We're playing "Hide the Soul."
I'll catch up with you.
I'll start loading the paint guns.
We don't play with dolls, do we?
Dolls are for girls.
But Charles is my new best friend.
You know better than to talk back to a superior.
Yes, sir.
Clean that up.
I'll take care of this.
I'll be back!
Left, left Left, right, left.
Left, left.
Get that weapon up, Barclay.
Platoon, halt.
Left face.
New boy!
Fall out.
Fall out!
Order, hut.
Port... arms!
Right shoulder... arms!
Left shoulder... arms.
Right shoulder, arms.
left shoulder, arms.
Port arms.
Left shoulder, arms.
Port arms.
Right shoulder, arms.
Port arms.
Barclay!
It's not a baton, Barclay.
You look like a goddamn majorette over here.
I'm not used to guns, sir.
Does this look like a gun to you, Barclay?
It's a rifle.
- Major Ellis!
- Sir!
Show the new boy the difference.
This is my rifle.
This is my gun.
This is for shooting and this is for fun.
A soldier's rifle is his best friend.
Remember that.
Stop!
Shit!
Help!
Please, mister!
Please, somebody!
Jesus!
I'm stuck, mister!
I'm in here!
Hold on!
I'm coming!
Where are you?
I'm coming.
Yell!
Make a noise!
Where are ya?
Oh, my God!
No, stop!
Stop!
fall out!
You get back there.
Finish unpacking.
Shelton's notorious for surprise inspections.
What are you doing?
What's it look like?
I'm polishing Shelton's shoes.
He makes you polish his shoes?
No, I offered out of the kindness of my heart.
Whitehurst, did you see Cochrane with that doll today?
No, what doll?
He was carrying a Good Guy doll... just before the accident with the garbage truck.
Good Guys.
I remember those.
Yeah, me too.
Lights out in a few minutes.
I'm gonna go get washed up.
I almost forgot.
Sgt. Clark wanted to know if you got that package.
What package?
He said you got a package in the mail.
Tyler was supposed to bring it to you.
Didn't you get it?
No.
Who would have sent me a package?
Hey, long time no see, pal!
No, you're dead!
We killed you!
You know what they say.
"You just can't keep a good guy down."
Andy, how you've grown.
You're not gonna kill me.
You need to transfer your soul.
Wrong again, wimp.
I got some fresh meat lined up.
I'm not gonna let you spoil it this time.
- Tyler?
- Yeah.
Just think.
Chucky's gonna be a "bro."
I'm not gonna let you get away with this.
I'm not gonna let you near that kid.
Agh!
What's the matter?
You homesick?
You miss your mommy?
What the fuck is this?
I'm sorry about your shoe.
I'll polish it.
Give me back the doll.
No, you listen to me.
Tell Whitehurst he's off the hook.
I got myself another slave.
Clean up this mess.
You got five demerits.
What about the doll?
My kid sister's birthday's coming up.
I think she's gonna Cove it, don't you?
Oh, shit.
Andy.
What the fuck?
No, stop!
What the fuck you doing in my room?
You wouldn't believe me.
Where's the doll Barclay?
Where's the fucking doll?
You took it, didn't you?
No!
What's going on?
Somebody sure as hell took it.
It's almost midnight.
Is this necessary?
I'm tying to weed out a thief. sir.
You've always told me how important it is... to uphold the school's code of honor.
All right, make your point.
But I want everybody back in at 01.00 hours.
Yes, sir.
By the time we get through with Barclay, he's gonna be living in a world full of shit.
We got an hour, so let's make it count.
Yes, sir.
Ladies, get those weapons in the air.
I want to see them high.
Higher!
I think I'm gonna throw up.
You're dead, new boy.
fucking geek.
"Dear Charles, you're it.
Come and find me.
Your best friend."
Shit!
Charles.
Come and find me.
Goddamn it.
- Platoon!
- Hut.
Double time!
Hut.
Knees up, ladies.
Whitehurst, where do the kids sleep?
Above the portico.
You're wearing combat boots, not ballet slippers!
Come on, move it Barclay.
it's gonna get worse than this.
Get the lead out.
Come on, move it.
Faster, faster.
Get those knees in the sky.
You son of a bitch!
Hell of a punch there, Barclay.
Now I'll see what kind of a tough guy you are.
Get your head around here.
Tyler, come out, come out, wherever you are.
Dolly dolly oxen free!
Get out here, you little son of a bitch!
Three!
You're not sounding of_
Four!
Five!
All right, Barclay.
You got me curious.
What are you tying to prove?
Forget it.
I want to know.
All right.
The doll's alive.
- He's after Tyler.
- Right, forget it.
I hope he can take care of himself.
Shh, shh.
Quiet.
Shut up!
I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
Just stay here and keep an eye out.
Oh, I live for this.
I know, Ivers.
Now go, go.
Shh, shh.
I don't see what you see in that guy.
He's just different from everybody else.
Oh, please.
Well, he's cute too.
Okay.
foster homes.
No wonder he's so quiet.
What was that?
So, you took the doll?
Shelton will have you court-martialed.
We're playing hide-and-seek.
What are you doing?
We couldn't sleep.
Oh, he is... so cute.
He was mine first.
Give him back.
Shh, you guys.
Please be quiet!
Can you go stand guard?
Yes, sir.
What's his name?
Ask him yourself.
Oh, right.
What is your name?
Hi, I'm Chucky and I'm your friend to the end.
Hi-de-ho.
Ha, ha.
I love it.
His real name is Charles Lee Ray.
Oh, is that so?
Give me your lipstick.
What for?
Just give it to me.
What are you doing?
Wait, stop.
You'll see.
Here you go, little baby.
You're messing him up.
You're so cute.
Don't do that.
He looks stupid!
You're making him look like a wuss!
He looks sweet.
What are you doing?
Someone's coming.
Come on, let's go.
Come on.
Wait.
Stop!
What about Charles?
Yuck!
This means war.
What the hell?
- I like to be hugged.
- Go--Jesus!
Aaah!
Aw, you gotta be fucking kidding' me.
The man lives through two tours in Nam... and then one night he just drops dead.
Doesn't make any sense.
At ease.
We will now take a moment of silence to honor Colonel Cochrane.
He was a fine man and he will be sorely missed.
Bow your heads for prayer.
Take... seats!
It's gettin' pretty shaggy, Carlson.
I want to see you on Friday.
Yes, sir.
Monday, Fabrizzio.
Yes, sir.
My man.
Tuesday.
Look at you, Whitehurst.
You're a disgrace.
When's the last time you had a trim?
Two weeks ago, Sergeant, I think.
You think?
I want to see you right after breakfast.
Yes, sir, Sergeant Botnick, sir.
What're you looking at, new boy?
Wednesday.
Barclay, what're you doing?
You can't just get up in the middle of mess.
Major.
At ease!
Tyler.
Hi, Barclay.
What's up?
I've got to talk to you about Chucky.
You mean Charles.
Have you seen him?
Not since last night.
He's hiding somewhere.
He's gonna lay low until he knows you're alone, and he's gonna come after you.
He wants to play.
Listen to me.
No matter what he says, no matter what he promises you, you've gotta stay away from him.
Don't let him fool you.
He's bad.
Charles isn't bad, he's a Good Guy.
It says so on his shirt.
He lies, Tyler.
Believe me, he's bad news.
He's hurt a lot of people.
I think Colonel Cochrane was one of them.
You're just jealous because he's my best friend now instead of yours.
Look, you better keep this.
Whitehurst, you are, without a doubt the sorriest excuse for a soldier to ever disgrace these walls.
Face it, you're not cut out for this life.
Why don't you do yourself a favor and get the hell out of Kent?
If I had any choice in the matter, I would, sir.
Smart ass.
Presto... you're bald.
What the hell?
How'd you get in there?
That haircut ain't regulation, soldier.
When's the last time you had a trim, huh?
Kiss it good-bye.
Presto...
you're dead.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
It's definitely you.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
I just forgot my --
Boo!
The annual war games... have been an unbroken tradition here at Kent for over 50 years.
Colonel Cochrane was a man who believed in tradition.
He not only would have wanted us to go on, he'd have ordered us to go on.
Therefore... the war games.... will proceed as scheduled.
Lieutenant Colonel Shelton... will command the blue team.
Major Rawlings will head up the reds.
The objective is simple.
To capture the other team's flag... and bring it back here safely to base.
Rawlings.
You will pick up your weapons... in the armory before moving out.
You will be using the standard issue Springfield aught-three.
Your ammo--
Shelton.
If you get hit, you are dead.
Hike back to base.
Commanders... take charge of your teams.
May the best team win.
Good luck, men and women.
Nice of you to join us.
Looks like Botnick's in a pretty bad mood today.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing's wrong.
I'm fine.
Nothing's wrong.
This oughta slow the pricks down.
left, left, left.
Her ewe go again.
Here we go again.
Same old stuff again.
Same old stuff again.
Marching down the avenue.
Marching down the avenue.
Two more miles and we'll be through.
Two more miles and we'll be through.
I'll be gettin' rid of you.
I'll be gettin' rid of you.
Same old ugly stuff.
Same old ugly stuff.
Her ewe go again.
Her ewe go again.
Marching down the avenue.
Marching down the avenue.
One more mile and we'll be through.
One more mile and we'll be through.
I'll be gettin' rid of you.
What's going on, Whitehurst?
You saw something, didn't you?
You saw Chucky.
Don't wimp out on me!
I need your help.
That kid needs your help.
I didn't see anything.
Okay?
I didn't see anything at all.
Your left, right, your left.
Your military left.
Ellis, let's make sure all the perimeters are secure.
Yes, sir.
She checks the windows.
And the baby-sitter hears this thump, thump, thumping.
Like something's being dragged across the floor upstairs.
Suddenly she thinks, "I haven't checked on the children."
So she hurries to the top of the stairs, and when she gets there... she sees her boyfriend completely dismembered, dragging himself across the floor by his chin.
Thump, slide.
Thump, slide.
- Thump, slide.
- That was gross.
Hey, you guys, I got a better story... and it's true.
It's about this mental institution... and it's a few miles away from here.
Hey.
Hope it wasn't something I said.
No.
I'm sorry.
Where do you think the red team's camped out?
Could be any here.
Shelton'll find 'em, he always does.
By the way, you can call me Kristin.
What?
Kristin.
It's my first name.
Do you have one?
Andy.
Come on, Andy.
I want to show you something.
Pretty cool, huh?
Yeah, I almost forgot there were places like that... where people just go to have fun.
Listen!
Somebody's out there.
It's probably just a chipmunk or something.
Nothing scares you, does it?
No.
Man, I gotta get out of this body.
I'm going after Tyler.
Are you crazy?
You'll never find him.
Wanna bet?
I swiped this from Shelton's tent.
He sent out a reconnaissance mission right before we pitched camp.
The red team is somewhere around here.
That kid's a sitting duck, Whitehurst.
Are you with me... or not?
I'm sorry, I can't.
Up and at 'em, ladies.
We're movin' out.
I want this camp to be a ghost town in five minutes.
I thought we weren't going till dawn, sir.
Someone stole the reconnaissance map, so we're making Our move now.
Get going, Hanley.
You wouldn't know anything about a missing map, would you?
Where the hell's Barclay?
Whitehurst!
Colonel Shelton, you better have a look in here, sir.
What is it, Ellis?
Barclay's gone AWOL, sir.
He stole the map.
That little fucking traitor's doubling for the reds.
Where's Tyler?
He went AWOL with some guy named Charles.
Where's Andy?
Whitehurst, where is he?
Platoon, halt!
All right.
De Silva, you're gonna take the right flank.
Siegel, take the left.
Check in on the radio every five minutes.
Yes, sir.
All right, move it.
The rest of us are gonna spread out and meet up with Ellis at Split Rock.
Move out.
Whitehurst, move!
Thanks for coming after me.
What are friends for?
Duck!
That was a close one.
Now we can play "Hide the Soul."
I'm tired.
I don't wanna play that dumb game anymore.
You're a fuckin' drag, you know that?
- Watch your mouth, Charles.
- Stop calling me that!
What's the knife for?
A good soldier is always prepared.
Barclay w_s right.
You're not a good guy.
Sorry kid.
You got me.
I'm bad.
Now... assume the position.
No!
Aaah!
Get back here!
Barclay!
Barclay!
Tyler!
You fuckin' traitor.
Give me my map!
Listen -
- You got any idea what we do to traitors, Barclay?
Tyler's in trouble.
Whitehurst, back me up.
Major Ellis, call in the flanks.
Yes, sir.
De Silva, Siegel, do you copy?
De Silva, do you copy?
De Silva, come in.
Aaah!
Siegel's on his way back.
No word yet from De Silva.
Keep trying'.
Yes, sir.
Help!
Tyler!
Barclay!
Are you okay, Tyler?
Looks like we got ourselves a little P.O.W. You're right,
Charles is bad.
He tried to hurt me.
Who the hell's Charles?
Come in, Barclay.
Who the hell is that?
It's Charles.
Who is this?
Put Barclay on, jarhead.
It's the reds.
They're up to something.
What do you want?
I want the kid.
Bring him up to the old Jeep or there'll be hell to pay.
Andy, don't do it.
De Silva!
You hear that, Barclay?
Don't touch her, you son of a bitch.
Now bring me the kid or I'll waste her.
Red team, red team.
come in, red team.
This is red team, over.
We got a situation up here at the old Jeep.
Blue team sighted.
Advise you to move your troops in.
Hope they like the taste of lead.
Now just sit back and watch the sparks fly.
All right, you two are gonna go on up ahead.
The rest of us are gonna circle around.
Shelton, this is no game.
This guy is dangerous.
Relax, Barclay, it's only paint.
All right, let's do it.
I'm scared, Barclay.
Yeah, me too.
All right, kid.
Get over here!
No!
Don't fuck with me!
I'll blow all of you to pieces.
Beat it!
Now just get down and shut up.
Yeah!
Ow!
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
De Silva, where the hell is everybody?
Hi, soldier.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Fuck me.
All right!
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Shit!
Stay down!
They're using live rounds!
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Oh, God, he's not breathing!
Get away from him!
You did this, didn't you?
You sick son of a bitch.
Now I'm gonna kill you!
Get off me!
Get off of him, he didn't do it!
Let go of me!
"Sayonara", suckers.
Look out!
No!
- Oh, my God, what happened?
- It's Whitehurst.
What the hell happened?
Who fucked with the rifles?
I don't know.
Get Clark on the radio...
Yes, sir.
and get me a medic up here right now!
All right, everybody stay calm.
Epstein, I want that radio!
Oh, God.
This is the last time I'm gonna tell you.
Give that thing a rest or you're out of here, both of you.
We're not bothering anybody.
You're bothering me.
Keep it down!
Geez!
Mister, you gotta help me!
What's wrong?
Charles, Charles he's after me.
Who's Charles?
He's a Good Guy.
He wants to play "Hide the Soul."
Have a seat over there.
Are you from Kent?
Yes, sir.
What's your name, son?
Ronald Tyler.
Private first class, sir.
Have a seat.
How 'bout some gum, Private?
I know how it must hurt... when a friend does something bad to you.
Sure does.
But I bet your friend -- what's his name, Charles?
I bet you Charles didn't mean it.
I bet you he's really sorry.
No, he isn't.
He wants to hurt me.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
I know what'll cheer you up.
Look what I found.
There you go.
Thank you, Daddy.
Let's go on the Super Loop.
Hey, maybe somebody's seen him.
Oh, God.
Come on.
Wait.
Mommy, Mommy, I loved it!
Were you scared?
No!
No!
Let's have some popcorn and we'll go on one more ride.
Perfect.
In there.
Don't even think about it.
Come on.
Okay.

Aaah!

This looks good.

He's got a gun!
Shit!
Aaah!

Oh, God.
Here... take it.
You can do it.
I'll be okay.
Help!
Help!
Yeah!
You're mine now, Tyler.

This is Andy Barclay.
Eight years ago, he touched off the scandal that nearly crippled this company, claiming that his Good Guy doll, Chucky, was possessed by Charles Lee Ray, the notorious Lakeshore Strangler.
(PEOPLE MURMURING)
Now I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, after all the lawsuits and negative publicity, when the company is finally getting back on its feet again, where is the wisdom in putting the Good Guy back on the market?
Mr. Sullivan, before any of this happened, the Good Guy outsold all our other toys 2-to-1.
Even now, interest in the market place is at its peak.
The factory is up and running again.
We should be in stores by next week.
We cannot let the fantasies of one disturbed boy influence company policy.
Well, what if the doll somehow affects another child in a negative way?
You could have a public relations nightmare on your hands.
You know, one of the hardest things about this business is that it is a business.
It doesn't matter what we're selling.
Whether it's cars, nuclear weapons, or, yes, even toys.
The bottom line is the bottom line.
And what are children, after all, but consumer trainees?
(ALL CHUCKLING)
Andy Barclay is ancient history.
No one remembers him.
Nobody cares.
I have made up my mind.
We're moving ahead.
Thank you.
WOMAN:
Okay.
MAN:
All right.
Mr. Sullivan.
If there's nothing I can say to convince you, then I must go on record with my position.
I'm completely against this.
Your position is crystal clear, Miles, and you can be sure I won't forget.
Just a minute, folks!
Please.
Mr. Sullivan, we have a little surprise for you.
The guys at the factory sent this over.
And we all wanted you to have it.
It's the first one off the assembly line.
The Good Guy of the '90s!
(ALL CHEERING)
Well, if there's nothing else, I'm gonna get going.
Fine.
PETZOLD:
It's just, my wife's expecting me.
It's our anniversary.
Fine, Petzold.
Well, I guess I could review the Larrabee report after dinner.

Well, despite a downdraft in the bond market, stocks were able to post a rally on Friday, thanks to a couple of different factors.
Not only did the stronger-than-expected employment report allay some recession fears, but also there was a technical rebound in stock, short covering, program buying, and the resurgence in the deal stocks help set the tone for rally on the Street.
Here's a look at the numbers now.
For Friday, the Dow Industrial's up sixteen and two-thirds.
Of the highs of the day, the transportation average up a little better than three.
Utilities bouncing up a point to pass at 12, at 22, 61, 78.
SP 500 Cash are better than two with the margin peaking up almost two and a half with the premier ending at 1.59.
New York Stock Exchange Index up 1.23, volume backing off a bit at 164 million shares.
Advances beat declines just about 9- to-5 on the New York Stock Exchange.
The up volume 103 million shares, the down volume... (MAN CONTINUES ON TV)

COCHRANE:
I see that for the past eight years you've been in one foster home after another.
Mind if I ask why?
They took me away from my mother.
She's under special care.
I know that.
I meant how come you never got settled anywhere?
Adjustment problems.
I can read, Barclay.
I'm asking you.
I never felt comfortable with those people.
They weren't family, they were strangers.
All right, listen up, Barclay.
I'm willing to cut you some slack because you've had it so rough, but you're a troublemaker.
And I got a real problem with troublemakers.
They don't fit into the system.
So here's my advice.
Grow up, you're not a kid anymore.
It's time to forget these fantasies of killer dolls.
Yes, sir.

"But when I became a man, I put away childish things. "

You must be new.
Otherwise you'd know they don't tolerate any form of individuality here.
Certainly nothing so personal as the first name.

He's God around here.

I asked you a question, nimrod!
No, sir!
I don't agree, sir!
Are you contradicting me, you sorry-ass sack of shit?
You asshole.
What did you say?
I said, "You asshole," sir!
You think you're pretty funny, don't you, De Silva?
Yes, I do, sir.
Why don't you drop and give me 25 right now?
Twenty-five what, sir?
Twenty-five push-ups, De Silva.
One, sir.
Two, sir...
Now, you women might think that because you're so much more delicate, you deserve some sort of special treatment,
and once a month we're just going to get on out of your way.

Andy?
Can't you read?
He was supposed to get this package.
Tampering with the mail is a federal offense.
Sorry.
Is he your best friend?
He's more than that.
He's my new lease on life.

I got a new body, and I ain't told anyone about my little secret yet.
So, what's your name, kid?
Tyler.
What's yours?
Chucky.
But, uh, my real name is Charles Lee Ray.

Is there anything you can't do?

Yes, sir.
...marked for both the red team and the blue team.
What are you doing, Tyler?
We're playing Hide the Soul.
I'll catch up with you.
I'll start loading the paint pellet.
We don't play with dolls, do we now, Tyler?
Dolls are for girls.
But Charles is my new best friend.

Yes, sir.

It's a rifle!

Would you please show the new boy the difference?
This is my rifle, this is my gun.
This is for shooting, and this is for fun.
A soldier's rifle is his best friend.
Remember that.

What are you doing?
What does it look like?
I'm polishing Shelton's shoes.
He makes you polish his shoes?
No, I offered out of the kindness of my heart.
Whitehurst, did you see Cochrane with that doll today?
No.
What doll?
He was carrying a Good Guy doll, just before the accident with the garbage truck.
Good Guys, I remember those.
Yeah, me, too.

Didn't you get it?
No.
Who would've sent me a package?
(GROANS)
Hey, long time no see, pal.
No, you're dead.
We killed you!
You know what they say, you just can't keep a Good Guy down.

You're not gonna kill me.
You need me.
You need to transfer your soul into my body.
Wrong again, wimp.
I got some fresh meat lined up and I'm not gonna let you spoil it, not this time.
(GASPS) Tyler.
Yeah, just think.
Chucky's gonna be a bro.

I'm not gonna let you near that kid.

You miss your mommy?
What the fuck is this?
I'm sorry about your shoe, all right.
I'll polish it.
Just give me back the doll.
No, no, you listen to me.
You tell Whitehurst he's off the hook, huh?
I got myself another slave.
And clean up this mess.

You took it, didn't you?
No!
What's going on?
Yeah, well, somebody sure as hell took it.
(THUNDER RUMBLING)
It's almost midnight, Colonel.
Is this really necessary?
I'm trying to weed out a thief, sir.
You've always told me how important it is to uphold the school's code of honor.
I'm simply trying to impress that upon the men, sir.
All right, Shelton, make your point.
But I want everybody back inside at 0100 hours.
Yes, sir.
By the time we get through with Barclay, he's going to be living in a whole world full of shit.
All right.
We've only got an hour, so let's make it count.
Yes, sir.

Ivers, he was mine first!
Give him back!

Can you go stand guard?
Yes, sir.
So what's his name?

All right.
What is your name, little doll?
Hi, I'm Chucky.
And I'm your friend to the end.

Just give it to me.
Oh, no.

It's getting pretty shaggy, Carlson.
I want to see you on Friday.
Yes, sir.
(GROANS) Monday, Fabrizzio.
(GRUNTS) Yes, sir.
My man.
(EXCLAIMS) Tuesday.
Look at you, Whitehurst.
You're a disgrace.
When's the last time you had a trim?
Two weeks ago, Sergeant, I think.
You think?
You think?
I want to see you right after breakfast.
You got it?
Yes, sir, Sergeant Botnick, sir.
And what are you looking at, new boy?
Wednesday.
Barclay, what are you doing?
You can't just get up in the middle of mess.
(ALL LAUGHING)
(MOUTHING) Shut up.
Major.
At ease!
(VIDEO GAME BEEPING)
Tyler.
Hi, Barclay.
What's up?
I gotta talk to you about Chucky.
You mean Charles.
Have you seen him?
Not since last night.
He's hiding somewhere.
He's gonna lay low till he knows you're alone, and then he's gonna come after you.
He just wants to play.
Listen to me, Tyler.
No matter what he says, no matter what he promises you, you've got to stay away from him.
Don't let him fool you.
He's bad.
Charles isn't bad.
He's a Good Guy.
It says so on his shirt.
He lies, Tyler.
Believe me, he's bad news.
He's hurt a lot of people.
I think Colonel Cochrane was one of them.
You're just jealous 'cause he's my best friend now, instead of yours.
(VIDEO GAME BEEPING)
Look, you better keep this.
(BUZZING)
Whitehurst, you are without a doubt the sorriest excuse for a soldier to ever disgrace these walls.
Face it, you're not cut out for this life.
Why don't you do yourself a favor and get the hell out of Kent?
If I had any choice in the matter, I would, sir.
Smart-ass.
Presto!
You're bald.
(CHUCKLES)
(SNIFFLES) Yeah.
(WHISTLING TUNE)
What the hell?
How did you get in there?
That haircut ain't regulation, soldier.
When's the last time you had a trim, huh?
(LAUGHING)
Kiss it goodbye.
(BUZZING)
(LAUGHING)
Presto!
You're dead.
(CHUCKY LAUGHING EVILLY)
It's definitely you.
I just forgot my...
My...
Boo!
(GASPS)
The annual war games have been an unbroken tradition here at Kent for over 50 years.
Colonel Cochrane was a man who believed in the value of tradition.
He not only would have wanted us to go on, he'd have ordered us to go on.
Therefore, the war games will proceed as scheduled.
(ALL YELLING)
Lieutenant Colonel Shelton will command the blue team.
Major Rawlings will head up the reds.
The objective is simple.
To capture the other team's flag, bring it back here safely to base.
Rawlings.
You will pick up your weapons in the armory before moving out.
You will be using the standard issue Springfield 0-3.
Your ammo.
(FIRING)
Shelton.
If you get hit, you are dead.
Hike back to base.
Commanders, take charge of your teams.
May the best team win.
Good luck, men and women.
Nice of you to join us.
(PANTS NERVOUSLY)
Looks like Botnick's in a pretty bad mood today.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing's wrong.
Nothing's wrong.
I'm fine.
Nothing's wrong.
This ought to slow the pricks down.

You saw something, didn't you?
You saw Chucky.
Don't wimp out on me now, Whitehurst.
I need your help.
That kid needs your help.
I didn't see anything, okay?
I didn't see anything at all.

Ellis, let's make sure the perimeters are secured.
Yes, sir.
She checks all the windows, and then the babysitter hears this thump, thump.
Thumping.
Like something's being dragged across the floor upstairs.
And suddenly she thinks, "I haven't checked on the children. "
So she hurries to the top of the stairs, and when she gets there, she sees her boyfriend, completely dismembered,
dragging himself across the floor by his chin.
Thump.
Slide.
Thump.

Ugh!

IVERS:
That is gross.
(DE SILVA LAUGHING)
Hey, you guys, I got a better story and it's true.
It's about this mental institution, and it's a few miles away from here.
Hey!
Hope it wasn't something I said.
(CHUCKLES) No.
I'm sorry.
De Silva, where do you think the red team's camped out?
Could be anywhere.
Shelton'll find them.
He always does.
By the way, you can call me Kristin.
What?
Kristin.
It's my first name.
Do you have one?
Andy.
Oh.
Come on, Andy, I want to show you something.
Pretty cool, huh?
Yeah.
BARCLAY:
I almost forgot there were places like that.
People just go to have fun.
(TWIGS CRACKLING) Listen!
Somebody's out there.
It's probably just a chipmunk or something.
Nothing scares you, does it?
No.
Man, I really gotta get out of this body.
I'm going after Tyler.
Are you crazy?
You'll never find them.
Wanna bet?
I swiped this from Shelton's tent.
He sent out a reconnaissance mission right before we pitched camp.
The red team is somewhere around here.
That kid's a sitting duck, Whitehurst.
Now, are you with me or not?
I'm sorry, I can't.
ELLIS:
Up and at 'em, ladies, we're moving out!
I want this camp to be a ghost town in five minutes!
I thought we weren't going until dawn, sir.
Someone stole the reconnaissance map out of the Colonel's tent, so we're making our move now.
Get going, Hanley.
Whitehurst.
You wouldn't know anything about a missing map, would you?
Where the hell's Barclay?
Whitehurst!
Colonel Shelton, you'd better have a look in here, sir.
(SIGHS)
What is it, Ellis?
Barclay's gone AWOL, sir.
(SCOFFS)
He stole the map.
That little fucking traitor's doubling for the reds.
Where's Tyler?
He went AWOL with some guy named Charles.
Where's Andy?
Whitehurst, where is he?
SHELTON:
Platoon, halt!
All right.
De Silva, you're going to take the right flank.
Siegel, you take the left.
I want you to check in on the radio every five minutes.
Yes, sir.
All right, move it.
The rest of us are gonna spread out and meet up with Ellis at Split Rock.
Move out!
Whitehurst, move!
Thanks for coming after me.
What are friends for?
Duck.
That was a close one.
Now, we can play Hide the Soul.
I'm tired.
I don't want to play that dumb game anymore.
You're a fucking drag, you know that?
Watch your mouth, Charles.
Stop calling me that!
What's the knife for?
A good soldier is always prepared, Tyler.
Barclay was right.
You're not a Good Guy.
(CHUCKLES) Sorry, kid, you got me.
I'm bad.
Now, assume the position.
TYLER:
No!
(CHUCKY GROANS)
Get back here!
Barclay!
Barclay!
Tyler!
(TWIG SNAPS)
Barclay, you fucking traitor, give me my map!
Listen to me, Shelton!
You got any idea what we do to traitors, Barclay?
Tyler's in trouble.
Come on, Whitehurst, back me up.
Major Ellis, call in the flanks.
Yes, sir.
De Silva, Siegel, do you copy?
De Silva, do you copy?
ELLIS ON RADIO:
De Silva, come in.
(SCREAMING)
Siegel's on his way back, sir.
No word yet from De Silva.
Well, keep trying.
Yes, sir.
TYLER:
Help!
Help!
Tyler!
Barclay!
Are you okay, Tyler?
Well, looks like we got ourselves a little POW.
Barclay, you were right.
Charles is bad.
He tried to hurt me.
Who the hell's Charles?
CHUCKY ON RADIO:
Come in, Barclay.
Come in.
Who the hell is that?
It's Charles.
Who is this?
CHUCKY:
Put Barclay on, jarhead.
ELLIS:
It's the reds.
They're up to something.
What do you want?
CHUCKY:
I want the kid.
Bring him up to the old jeep or there'll be hell to pay.
DE SILVA:
Andy, don't do it!
De Silva!
You hear that, Barclay?
BARCLAY:
Don't touch her, you son of a bitch.
Now, bring me the kid or I'll waste her.
Red team, red team.
Come in, red team.
CADET:
This is red team.
Over.
CHUCKY:
We got a situation up here at the old jeep.
Blue team sighted.
Advise you to move your troops in.
CHUCKY:
I hope they like the taste of lead.
Now just sit back and watch the sparks fly.
All right, you two are going to go on up ahead, draw 'em out.
The rest of us are gonna circle around.
Shelton, this is no game.
I'm telling you, this guy is dangerous.
Relax, Barclay.
It's only paint.
All right.
Let's do it.
I'm scared, Barclay.
Yeah, me, too.
All right, kid.
Get over here!
No.
Don't fuck with me!
I'll blow all of you to pieces!
Beat it.
Now, just get down and shut up.
Yeah.

Now I'm gonna kill you!

He didn't do it!
Stop it!
Let go of me.
Stop it!

DE SILVA:
No!

I know how it must hurt when a friend does something bad to you.
Sure does.
But I bet your friend...
What's his name, Charles?
I bet you Charles didn't mean it.
I bet you he's really sorry.
No, he isn't.
He wants to hurt me.
Nobody's going to hurt you.
Hey, I know what will cheer you up.
Look what I found.

(SIREN WAILING)
This is Andy barclay.
Eight years ago he touch off the scandal...
That nearly crippled, this company, claiming that his good guy doll, Chucky, was possessed by...
Charles Lee ray, the notorious lake-shore strangler.
Now I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, after the lawsuits and negative publicity, when the company is finally getting back on its feet, where is the wisdom in putting the good guy
Mr. Sullivan, before this happened...
The good guy outsold our other toys 2 to 1.
Even now, interest in the marketplace is at its peak.
The factory is up and running again.
We should be in stores by next week.
We cannot let the fantasies of one disturbed boy...
Influence company policy.
What if the doll somehow...
Affects another child in a negative way?
You could have a public relations nightmare.
One of the hardest things about this business is...
That it is a business doesn't matter what we're selling.
Whether it's cars nuclear weapons...
Or yes, even toys.
The bottom line is the bottom line and what are children but consumer trainees?
Andy barclay is ancient history.
No one remembers him.
Nobody cares.
I have made up my mind.
We're moving ahead.
Thank you.
Okay.
All right.
Mr. Sullivan.
If there's nothing I can say to convince you, then I must go on record.
I'm completely against this.
Your position is crystal clear, Miles.
And you can be sure I won't forget.
Just a minute, folks.
Mr. Sullivan, we have a surprise.
Guys at the factory sent this over.
First off the assembly line, the good guy of the '90s.
If there's nothing else, I'm gonna get going.
Fine.
It's just, my wife's expecting me.
It's our anniversary.
Fine, Petzold.
I could review the larrabee report after dinner.
Good night, Mr. Sullivan.
Good night.
Ahh_
despite a downdraft in the bond market, stocks were able to post a rally on Friday...
Thanks to a couple of different factors.
Not only did the employment report allay recession fears, but also there was a technical rebound in buying...
And a resurgence in deal stocks helped set the tone.
Here's a look at the numbers.
The dow industrialist's up 16.
The transportation average up 3.
Utilities bouncing up...
Utilities bouncing up...
In a moment's time...
Oh, shit.
Bonds headed South on the economic data, which served to bolster the U.S. dollar.
The dollar index up a quarter point.
Point 43 at two-thirty point 43.
March crude up...
Hi, my name is Larry.
Hi, my name is Pauli.

I like to be...
Don't fuck with the Chuck.
Oh, my God.
Just like the good old days.
Nothing like a strangulation to get the circulation going.
You're my only ticket out of here, Andy.
I gotta get out of this goddamn body.
Where are you, you little shit?
Inward hut.
Come on, come on.
Yeah, you can do it.
You can do it, Jackson, hurry up.
Come on, let's go.
Yeah, come on.
Get moving.
Go to the end of the line.
,left, left, left, left.
I see for the past eight years...
You've been in one foster home after another.
Mind if I ask why?
They took me away she's under special care.
I knew that.
How come you never got settled anywhere?
Adjustment problems.
I can read, barclay.
I'm asking you.
I never felt comfortable with those people.
They weren't family.
They were strangers.
All right, listen up, barclay.
I'm willing to cut you some slack, because you've had it rough.
But you're a troublemaker.
And I got a problem with troublemaker.
They don't fit into the system.
So here's my advice.
Grow up!
You're not a kid any more.
It's time to forget these fantasies of killer dolls.
Yes, sir.
"When I was a child,
"I thought as a child.
"When I became a man,
I put away childish things."
First Corinthians.
Look alive.
On your feet.
At Kent, we take bed wetters and
oh, yes.
Yes, oh.
Yes, we're seeing some skin now, aren't we?
Presto, you're bald.
Always feels weird at first.
Next.
Kiss it good-bye.
The romans invented the military cut.
You know why?
Why?
To keep their hair short, so their enemies couldn't grab it in battle...
And slit their throat.
Ha, ha, ha.
Now hold still.
Oh, shit.
Ha, ha, ha.
We're back and we're better than ever.
No one will play with me.
Uh-oh, there's a friend indeed hey, cheer up.
Who are you?
I'm a good guy.
Good guy, good guy, good guy!
I've just come from the good guy clubhouse...
And I'll be your friend to the end.
You will?
[ Echoing ] Wow.
Sure I will.
Hi-de-ho.
All aboard for high-flying fun with me, your friend to the end, the good guy doll from play pals.
Are you okay?
Bastards!
Fucking bastards!
What happened?
Shelton!
Shelton and his goddamn lackeys.
Thank you.
I'm fine
I'm Andy.
You must be new.
Otherwise...
You'd know they don't tolerate individuality, nothing as personal as the first name.
Right.
I forgot.
- Barclay.
- Whitehurst.
Harold Aubrey, for the record.
So, who's this Shelton?
Cadet lieutenant colonel Brett C. Shelton.
He's God around here don't expect mercy from him.
Welcome to hell, barclay.

That's much better.
Shit, Whitehurst.
You are without a doubt...
The most pathetic thing I have ever seen!
Wouldn't you agree?
I asked you a question, nimrod.
No, sir!
I don't agree, sir!
Are you contradicting me, you sorry-ass sack of shit?
You asshole.
- What did you say?
- I said, "you asshole." Sir!
Think you're pretty funny, don't you, de silva?
Yes, I do, sir.
Drop and give me 25.
Right now.
25 what, sir?
25 push-ups, de silva.
One, sir!
Two, sir!
Three, sir!
You women might think...
That because you're so much delicate...
You deserve special treatment...
And once a month we're gonna get out of your way.
You can forget it!

The same rules apply for everybody.

Only the fittest survive.

How you doing, Tyler?
Sony, nothing from your dad.

Give this to the new kid for me.
- Barclay.
- Yes, sir.
That a boy.
Out of the way.
Watch it, kid.
Hey!
Look out!
A good guy.
Who the fuck are you?

I'm new and improved.
I never saw a doll like you before.
All right, kid.
Fun's over.
Where the hell's Andy?
Andy?
Can't you read?
He was supposed to get this package.
Tampering with the mail is a federal offense.
Sorry.
Is he your best friend?
He's more than that.
He's my new lease on life wait a minute.
I got a new body...
And I ain't told anyone about my little secret yet.
So, what's your name, kid?
Tyler.
What's yours?
Chucky.
But my real name...
Is Charles Lee ray.
Whitehurst, what am I doing wrong?
Is there anything you can't do?
I can't get thrown out of this place.
Barclay, meet de silva.
Hi.
So, you want to show me?
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
No, put the elbow like that.
And like this.
No.
Keep both eyes open.
Keep your sights on the target.
Hold your breath.
Squeeze the trigger.
Don't pull it.
You're not concentrating.
It was great what you did for us at formation.
Shelton's a major dick.
Te me about it.
Hold still.
What do you call this game?
"Hide the soul." Trust me, you're gonna love it.
Whatever you say, Charles.
Ade due damballa!
Give me the power, I beg of you!
Leveau mercierdu bois chaloitte..
Secoisse entienne mais pois de...

Marked for both the red team and the blue team.
What are you doing, Tyler?
We're playing "hide the soul."
I'll catch up with you.
I'll start loading we don't play with dolls, do we?
Dolls are for girls.
But Charles you know better than to talk back to a superior.
Yes, sir.
Clean that up.

Barclay!
It's not a Baton, barclay.
You look like a goddamn majorette over here.
I'm not used to guns, sir.
Does this look like a gun to you, barclay?
It's a rifle.
- Major Ellis!
- Sir!
Show the new boy the difference.
This is my rifle.
This is my gun.
This is for shooting and this is for fun.
A soldier's rifle is his best friend.
Remember that.
Stop!
Shit!
Help!
Please, mister!
Please, somebody!
I'm stuck, mister!

I'm polishing Shelton shoes.
He makes you Polish his shoes?
No, I offered out of the kindness of my heart.
Whitehurst, did you see Cochrane no, what doll?
He was carrying just before the accident with the garbage truck.
Good guys.
I remember those.
Yeah, me too.
Lights out in a few minutes.
I'm gonna go get washed up.
I almost forgot.
Sgt. Clark wanted to know what package?
He said you got

No.
Who would have sent me a package?
Hey, long time no see, pal!
No, you're dead!
We killed you!
You know what they say.
"You just can't keep a good guy down."
Andy, how you've grown.
You're not gonna kill me.
You need to transfer your soul.
Wrong again, wimp.
I got some fresh meat lined up.
I'm not gonna let you spoil it this time.
- Tyler?
- Yeah.
Just think.
Chucky's gonna be a "bro."
I'm not gonna let you get away with this.
I'm not gonna let you near that kid.
Ugh!
What's the matter?
You home sick?
You miss your mommy?
What the fuck is this?
I'm sorry about your shoe.
I'll Polish it.
Give me back the doll.
No, you listen to me.
Tell whitehurst he's off the hook.
I got myself another slave.
Clean up this mess.
You got five demerits.
What about the doll?
My kid sister's birthday's coming up.
I think she's gonna love it, don't you?
Oh, shit.
Andy.
What the fuck?
No, stop!
What the fuck you doing in my room?
J., where's the doll where's the fucking doll?
- You took it, didn't you?
- No!
What's going on?
Somebody sure as hell took it.
It's almost midnight.
Is this necessary?
I'm tying to weed out a thief.
Sir.
You've always told me how important it is...
To uphold the school's code of honor.
All right, make your point.
But I want everybody back in at 01:00 hours.
Yes, sir.
By the time we get through with barclay, he's gonna be living in the world full of shit.
We got an hour, so let's make it count.
Yes, sir.
Ladies, get those weapons in the air.
I want to see them high.
Higher!
I think I'm gonna throw up.
You're dead, new boy.
Fucking geek.
"Dear Charles, you're it.
Come and find me.
Your best friend"
shit!
Charles
come and find me.
Goddamn it.
Platoon!
Double time!
Hut.
Knees up, ladies.
Whitehurst, where do the kids sleep?
You're wearing combat boots, come on, move it's gonna get get the lead out.
Come on, move it.
Faster, faster.
Get those knees in the sky.
You son of a bitch!
Hell of a punch there, barclay.
Now I'll see what kind of a tough guy you are.
Get your head around here.
Tyler, come out, come out, wherever you are.
Olly olly oxen free!
Get out here, you little son of a bitch!
Three!
You're not sounding of_ fnilr!
Five!
All right, barclay.
You got me curious.
What are you tying to prove?
Forget it.
I want to know.
All right.
The doll's alive.
- He's after Tyler.
- Right, forget it.
I hope he can take care of him self.
Shh, shh.
Quiet.
Shut up!
I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
Just stay here and keep an eye out.
Oh, I live for this.
I know, Rivers.
Now go, go.
Shh, shh.
I don't see what you see in that guy.
He's just different from everybody else.
Oh, please.
Well, he's cute too.
Okay.
Forster homes.
No wonder he's so quiet.
What was that?
So, you took the doll?
Shelton will have you court-martial-ed.
We're playing hide-and-seek.
We couldn't sleep.
Oh, he is...
So cute.
He was mine first.
Give him back.
Shh, you guys.
Please be quiet!
Can you go stand guard?
What's his name?
Ask him yourself.
Oh, right.
What is your name?
Hi, I'm Chucky and I'm hi-de-ho.
Ha, ha.
I love it.
His real name is Charles Lee ray.
Oh, is that so?
Give me your lipstick.
What for?
Just give it to me.
What are you doing?
Wait, stop.
Here you go, little baby.
You're messing him up.
Don't do that.
He looks stupid!
You're making him look like a wuss!
He looks sweet.
What are you doing?
Someone's coming.
Come on, let's go.
Come on.
Wait.
Stop!
Yuck!
This means war.
What the hell?
- I like to be hugged.
- Go...
Jesus!
Aah!
Aw, you gotta be fucking kidding' me.
The man lives through two tours in nam...
And then one night he just drops dead.
Doesn't make any sense.
At ease.
We will now take a moment of silence to honor colonel Cochrane.
He was a fine man and he will be sorely missed.
Bow your heads for prayer.
Take...
Seats!
It's gettin' pretty shaggy, Carlson.
I want to see you on Friday.
Monday, Fabrizzio.
Yes, sir.
My man.
Tuesday.
Look at you, whitehurst.
You're a disgrace.
When's the last time you had a trim?
Two weeks ago, sergeant, I think.
I want to see you right after breakfast.
Yes, sir, sergeant Botnick, sir.
What're you looking at, new boy?
Wednesday.
Barclay, what're you doing?
You can't just get up in the middle of mess.
Major.
At ease!
Tyler.
Hi, Barclay.
What's up?
I've got to talk to you about Chucky.
Have you seen him?
Not since last night.
He's hiding somewhere.
He's gonna lay low until he knows you're alone, and he's gonna come after you.
He wants to play.
Listen to me.
No matter what he says, no matter what he promises you, you've gotta stay away from him.
Don't let him fool you.
He's bad.
Charles isn't bad, he's a good guy.
It says so on his shirt.
He lies, Tyler.
He's hurt a lot of people.
I think colonel Cochrane was one of them.
You're just jealous because he's my best friend now instead of yours.
Look, you better keep this.
Whitehurst, you are, without a doubt the sorriest excuse for a soldier to ever face it, you're not cut out for this life.
Why don't you do yourself a favor and get if I had any choice in the matter, I would, sir.
Smart ass.
Presto...
You're bald.
What the hell?
How'd you get in there?
That haircut ain't regulation, soldier.
When's the last time you had a trim, huh?
Kiss it good-bye.
Presto...
You're dead.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
It's definitely you.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
I just forgot my...
Boo!
The annual war games...
Have been an unbroken tradition here at Kent for over 50 years.
Colonel Cochrane was a man who believe in tradition.
He not only would have wanted us to go on, he'd have ordered us to go on.
Therefore...
The war games...
Will proceed as scheduled.
Lieutenant colonel Shelton..
Will command the blue team.
Major Rawlings will head up the reds.
The objective is simple.
To capture the other team's flag...
And bring it back here safely to base.
Rawlings.
You will pick up your weapons...
In the armory before moving out.
You will be using the standard issue Springfield aught-three.
Your ammo...
Shelton.
If you get hit, you are dead.
Hike back to base.
Commanders..
Take charge of your teams.
May the best team win.
Good luck, men and women.
Nice of you to join us.
Looks like Botnick's in a pretty bad mood today.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing's wrong.
I'm fine.
Nothing's wrong.
This ought a slow the pricks down.
Left, left, left.
Here we go again.
Here we go again.
Same old stuff again.
Same old stuff again.
Marching down the Avenue.
Marching down the Avenue.
Two more Miles and we'll be through.
Two more Miles and we'll be through.
I'll be gettin' rid of you.
I'll be gettin' rid of you.
Same old ugly scum.
Same old ugly stuff.
Here we go again.
Her ewe go again.
Marching down the Avenue.
Marching down the Avenue.
One more mile and we'll be through.
One more mile and we'll be through.
I'll be gettin' rid of you.
What's going on, whitehurst?
You saw something, didn't you?
You saw Chucky.
Don't wimp out on me!
I need your help.
That kid needs your help.
Okay?
I didn't see anything at all.
Your left, right, your left.
Your military left.
Ellis, let's make sure all the perimeters are secure.
She checks the windows.
And the baby-sitter hears this thump, thump, thumping.
Like something's being dragged across the floor upstairs.
Suddenly she thinks, "I haven't checked on the children"
so she hurries to the top of the stairs, and when she gets there...
She sees her boyfriend completely dismembered, dragging himself across the floor by his chin.
Thump, slide.
Thump, slide.
Thump, slide.
Hey, you guys, I got a better story...
And it's true.
It's about this mental institution...
And it's a few Miles away from here.
Hey.
Hope it wasn't something I said.
No.
I'm rosy.
Where do you think the red team's camped out?
Could be anywhere.
Shelton'll find 'em, he always does.
By the way, you can call me Kristin.
What?
Kristin.
It's my first name.
Do you have one?
Andy.
Come on, Andy.
I want to show you something.
Pretty cool, huh?
Yeah, I almost forgot there were places like that...
Where people just go to have fun.
Listen!
Somebody's out there.
It's probably just a chipmunk or something.
Nothing scares you, does it?
No.
Man, I really got to get out of this body.
I'm going after Tyler.
Are you crazy?
You'll never find him.
Wanna bet?
I swiped this from Shelton's tent.
He sent out a reconnaissance mission right before we pitched camp.
The red team is somewhere around here.
That kid's a sitting duck, whitehurst.
Are you with me...
Or not?
I'm rosy, I can't.
Up and at 'em, ladies.
We're movin' out.
I want this camp to be a ghost town in five minutes.
I thought we weren't going till dawn, sir.
Someone stole the reconnaissance map, so we're making our move now.
Get going, Hanley.
You wouldn't know anything about a missing map, would you?
Where the hell's barclay?
Whitehurst!
Colonel Shelton, you better have a look in here, sir.
What is it, Ellis?
Barclay's gone awol, sir.
He stole the map.
That little fucking traitor's doubling for the reds.
Where's Tyler?
He went awol with
where's Andy?
Whitehurst, where is he?
Platoon, halt!
All right.
De silva, you're gonna take the right flank.
Siegel, take the left.
Check in on the radio yes, sir.
All right, move it.
The rest of us are gonna spread out and meet up move out.
Whitehurst, move!
Thanks for coming after me.
What are friend for?
Duck!
That was a close one.
Now we can play "hide the soul"
I'm tired.
I don't wanna play that dumb game any more.
You're a fuckin' drag, you know that?
- Watch your mouth, Charles.
- Stop calling me that!
What's the knife for?
A good soldier is always prepared.
Barclay was right.
You're not a good guy.
Sorry kid.
You got me.
I'm bad now..
Assume the position.
No!
Aah!
Get back here!
Barclay!
Barclay!
Tyler!
You fuckin' traitor.
Give me my map!
Listen...
You got any idea what we
Tyler's in trouble.
Whitehurst, back me up.
Major Ellis, call in the flanks.
De silva, siegel, do you copy?
De silva, do you copy?
De silva, come in.
Aah!
Siegel's on his way back.
No word yet from de silva.
Keep tryin'.
Yes, sir.
Help!
Tyler!
Barclay!
Are you okay, looks like we got ourselves a little P.O.W.
Charles is bad.
He tried to hurt me.
Who the hell Charles?
Come in, barclay.
It's Charles.
Who is this?
Put barclay on, it's the reds.
They're up to something.
What do you want?
I want the kid.
Bring him up to the old jeep or there'll be hell to pay.
Andy, don't do it.
You hear that, barclay?
Don't touch her, now bring me the kid or I'll waste her.
Red team, red team.
Come in, red team.
This is red team, over.
We got a situation up blue team sighted.
Advise you to move your troops in.
Hope they like the taste of lead.
Now just sit back and watch the sparks fly.
All right, you two are gonna go on up ahead.
The rest of us are gonna circle around.
Shelton, this is no game.
This guy is dangerous.
Relax, barclay, it's only paint.
All right, all right let's do it.
I'm scared, barclay.
Yeah, me too.
All right, kid.
Get over here!
No!
Don't fuck with me!
I'll blow all of you to pieces.
Beat it!
Now just get down and shut up.
Yeah!
Ow!
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
De silva, where the hell is everybody?
Hi, soldier.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Fuck me.
All right!
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Shit!
Stay down!
They're using live rounds!
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Oh, God, he's not breathing!
Get away from him!
You did this, didn't you?
You sick son of a bitch.
Now I'm gonna kill you!
Get off of him, he didn't do it!
Sayonara, suckers.
Look out!
No!
Oh, my God, what happened?
What the hell happened?
Who fucked with the rifles?
Get Clark on the radio...
And get me a medic up here right now!
All right, everybody stay calm.
Epstein, I want that radio!
Oh, God.
This is the last time I'm gonna tell you give that thing a rest or you're out of here, both of you.
We're not bothering anybody.
You're bothering me.
Geez!
Mister, you gotta help me!
What's wrong?
Charles, Charles who's Charles?
He's a good guy.
Have a seat over there.
Are you from Kent?
What's your name, son?
Ronald Tyler.
Private first class, sir.
Have a seat.
How 'bout some gum, private?
I know how it must hurt...
When a friend does something bad to you.
Sure does.
But I bet your friend...
What's his name, Charles?
I bet you Charles didn't mean it.
I bet you he's really sorry.
No, he isn't.
He wants to hurt me.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
I know what'll cheer you up.
Look what I found.
There you go.
Thank you, daddy.
Let's go on the super loop.
Hey, maybe somebody's seen him.
Oh, God.
Come on.
Wait.
Mommy, mommy, I love it!
Were you scared?
No!
Let's have some popcorn and we'll go on one more ride.
Perfect.
In there.
Don't even think about it.

This is Andy Barclay.
Eight years ago he touch off the scandal... that nearly crippled, this copany, claiming that his Good Guydoll, Chucky, was possessed by...
Charles Lee Ray, the notorious Lakeshore Strangler.
Now I ask you, ladies and gentlemen, after the lawsuits and negative publicity, when the company is finally getting back on its feet, where is the wisdom in putting the Good Guy
Mr. Sullivan, before this happened... the Good Guy outsold our other toys 2 to 1 .
Even now, interest in the marketplace is at its peak.
The factoy is up and running again.
We should be in stores by next week.
We cannot let the fantasies ofone disturbed boy... influence company policy.
What if the doll somehow... affects anotherchild in a negative way?
You could have a public relations nightmare.
One ofthe hardest things about this business is... that it is a business
Doesn't matter what we're selling.
Whether it's cars nuclear weapons... or yes, even toys.
The bottom line is the bottom line
And what are children but consummer tranees?
Andy Barclay is ancient histoy.
No one remembers him.
Nobody cares.
I have made up my mind.
We're moving ahead.
Thank you.
Okay.
Al l right.
Mr. Sullivan.
If there's nothing I can say to convince you, then I must go on record.
I'm completely against this.
Your position is cystal clear, Miles.
And you can be sure I won't forget.
Just a minute, folks.
Mr. Sullivan, we have a surprise.
Guys at the factoy sent this over.
First offthe assembly line, the Good Guy of the '90s.
If there's nothing else, I'm gonna get going.
Fine.
it's just, my wife's expecting me.
It's our anniversay.
Fine, Petzold.
I could review the Larrabee report after dinner.
Good night, Mr. Sullivan.
Good night.
Ahh_
Despite a downdraft in the bond market, stocks were able to post a rally on friday... thanks to a couple of different factors.
Not only did the employment report allay recession fears, but also there was a technical rebound in buying... and a resurgence in deal stocks helped set the tone.
Here's a look at the numbers.
The Dow industrial's up 16.
The transportation average up 3.
Utilities bouncing up--
Utilities bouncing up--
In a moment's time --
Oh, shit.
Bonds headed south on the economic data, which served to bolster the U.S. dollar.
The dollar index up a quarter point.

You're my only ticket out of here, Andy.
I gotta get out of this goddamn body.
Where are you, you little shit?
Inward hut.
Come on, come on.
Yeah, you can do it.
You can do it, Jackson, hurry up.
Come on, let's go.
Yeah, come on.
Get moving.
go to the end of the line.
,Left, left left, left.
I see for the past eight years... you've been in one foster home after another.
Mind if I ask why?
They took me away
She's under special care.
I knnw that.
How come you never got settled anywhere?
Adiustment problems.
I can read, Barclay.
I'm asking you.
I never felt comfortable with those people.
They weren't family.
They were strangers.
All right, listen up, Barclay.
I'm willing to cutyou some slack, because you've had it rough.
But you're a troublemaker.
And I got a problem with troublemaker.
They don't fit into the system.
So here's my advice.
Grow up!
You're not a kid anymore.
It's time to forget these fantasies of killer dolls.
Yes, sir.
"When I was a child,
"l thought as a child.
"When I became a man, I put away childish things."
First Conrinthians.
Look alive.
On your feet.
At Kent, we take bed wetters and
Oh, yes.
Yes, oh.
Yes, we're seeing some skin now, aren't we?
Presto, you're bald.
Always feels weird at first.
Next.
Kiss it good-bye.
The Romans invented the militay cut.
You know why?
Why?
To keep their hair short, so their enemies couldn't grab it in battle... and slit their throat.
Ha, ha, ha.
Now hold still.
Oh, shit.
Ha, ha, ha.
We're back and we're better than ever.
No one will play with me.
Uh-oh, there's a friend indeed
Hey, cheer up.
Who are you?
I'm a Good Guy.
Good Guy, Good Guy, Good Guy!
I've just come from the Good Guy clubhouse... and I'll be your friend to the end.
You will?
[ Echoing ] Wow.
Sure I will.
Hi-de-ho.
All aboard for high-flying fun with me, your friend to the end, the Good Guydoll from Play Pals.
Are you okay?
Bastards!
Fucking bastards!
What happened?
Shelton!
Shelton and his goddamn lackeys.
Thankyou.
I'm fine I'm Andy.
You must be new.
Otherwise... you'd know they don't tolerate individuality, nothing as personal as the first name.
Right. I forgot.
- Barclay.

Harold Aubrey, for the record.
So, who's this Shelton?
Cadet lieutenant Colonel Brett C. Shelton.
He's God around here
Don't expect mercy from him.

You are without a doubt... the most pathetic thing I have ever seen!
Wouldn't you agree?
I asked you a question, nimrod.
No, sir!
I don't agree, sir!
Areyou contradicting me, you sory-ass sack of shit?
You asshole.

Think you're pretty funny, don't you, De Silva?
Yes, I do, sir.

I'm new and improved.
I never saw a doll like you before.
All right, kid.
Fun's over.
Where the hell's Andy?
Andy?
Can't you read?
He was supposed to get this package.
Tampering with the mail is a federal offense.
Sorry.
Is he your best friend?
He's more than that.
He's my new lease on life
Wait a minute.
I got a new body... and I ain't told anyone about my little secret yet.
So, what's your name, kid?
Tyler.
What's yours?
Chucky.
But my real name... is Charles Lee Ray.
Whitehurst,
What am I doing wrong?
is there anything you can't do?
I can't get thrown out ofthis place.
Barclay, meet De Silva.
Hi.
So, you want to show me?
Yeah, sure.
Okay.
No, put the elbow like that.
And like this.
No.
Keep both eyes open.
Keepyour sights on the target.
Hold your breath.
Squeeze the trigger.
Don't pull it.
You're not concentrating.
It was great what you did for us at formation.
Shelton's a maior dick.
Te me about it.
Hold still.
What doyou call this game?
"Hide the Soul." Trust me, you're gonna love it.
Whateveryou say, Charles.

I'll catch up with you.
I'll start loading
We don't play with dolls, do we?
Dolls are forgirls.
But Charles
You know better than to talk back to a superior.
Yes, sir.
Clean that up.
I'll take care of this.

You look like a goddamn majorette over here.
I'm not used to guns, sir.
Does this look like a gun to you, Barclay?
It's a rifle.
- Major Ellis!
- Sir!
Show the new boy the difference.
This is my rifle.
This is my gun.
This is for shooting and this is for fun.
A soldier's rifle is his best friend.

Shelton's notorious for surprise

I'm polishing Shelton shoes.
He makes you polish his shoes?
No, I offered out ofthe kindness of my heart.
Whitehurst, did you see Cochrane
No, what doll?
He was carying lust before the accident with the garbage truck.
Good Guys.
I remember those.
Yeah, me too.
Lights out in a few minutes.
I'm gonna go get washed up.
I almost forgot.
Sgt. Clarkwanted to know
What package?
He said you got
Tylerwas supposed to bring it toyou.
No.
Who would have sent me a package?
Hey, long time no see, pal!
No, you're dead!
We killed you!
You know what they say.
"Youjust can't keep a good guy down."
Andy, how you've grown.
You're not gonna kill me.
You need to transfer your soul.
Wrong again, wimp.
I got some fresh meat lined up.
I'm not gonna let you spoil it this time.
- Tyler?
- Yeah.
Just think.
Chucky's gonna be a "bro."
I'm not gonna let you get away with this.
I'm not gonna let you near that kid.
Agh!
What's the matter?
You home sick?
You miss your mommy?
What the fuck is this?
I'm sorry about your shoe.
I'll polish it.
Give me back the doll.
No, you listen to me.
Tell Whitehurst he's off the hook.
I got myself another slave.
Clean up this mess.
You got five demerits.
What about the doll?
My kid sister's birthday's coming up.
I think she's gonna love it, don't you?
Oh, shit.
Andy.
What the fuck?
No, stop!
What the fuck you doing in my room?
J Where's the doll
Where's the fucking doll ?
- You took it, didn't you?
- No!
What's going on?
Somebody sure as hell took it.
It's almost midnight.
Is this necessay?
I'm tying to weed out a thief. sir.
You've always told me how important it is... to uphold the school's code of honor.
All right, make your point.
But I want eveybody back in at 01:00 hours.
Yes, sir.
By the time we get through with Barclay, he's gonna be living in the world full mof shit.
We got an hour, so let's make it count.
Yes, sir.
Ladies, get those weapons in the air.
I want to see them high.
Higher!
I think I'm gonna throw up.
You're dead, new boy.
fucking geek.
"Dear Charles, you're it.
Come and find me.
Your best friend"
Shit!
Charles
Come and find me.
Goddamn it.
Platoon!
Double time!
Hut.
Knees up, ladies.
Whitehurst, where do the kids sleep?
You're wearing combat boots,
Come on, move
It's gonna get
Get the lead out.
Come on, move it.
Faster, faster.
Get those knees in the sky.
You son of a bitch!
Hell of a punch there, Barclay.
Now I'll see what kind of a tough guy you are.
Get your head around here.
Tyler, come out, come out, wherever you are.
Olly olly oxen free!
Get out here, you little son ofa bitch!
Three!
You're not sounding of_
Fnilr!
Fiv_!
All right, Barclay.
You got me curious.
What areyou tying to prove?
Forget it.
I want to know.
All right.
The doll's alive.
- He's after Tyler.
- Right, forget it.
I hope he can take care of him self.
Shh, shh.
Quiet.
Shut up!
I can't believe I let you talk me into this.
Just stay here and keep an eye out.
Oh, I live for this.
I know, Ivers.
Now go, go.
Shh, shh.
I don't see what you see in that guy.
He's just different from eveybody else.
Oh, please.
Well, he's cute too.
Okay.
forster homes.
No wonder he's so quiet.
What was that?
So, you took the doll?
Shelton will have you court-martialed.
We're playing hide-and-seek.
We couldn't sleep.
Oh, he is... so cute.
He was mine first.
Give him back.
Shh, you guys.
Please be quiet!
Can you go stand guard?
What's his name?
Ask him yourself.
Oh, right.
What is your name?
Hi, I'm Chucky and I'm
Hi-de-ho.
Ha, ha.
I love it.
His real name is Charles Lee Ray.
Oh, is that so?
Give me your lipstick.
What for?
Just give it to me.
What areyou doing?
Wait, stop.
Here you go, little baby.
You're messing him up.
Don't do that.
He looks stupid!
You're making him look like a wuss!
He looks sweet.
What are you doing?
Someone's coming.
Come on, let's go.
Come on.
Wait.
Stop!
Yuck!
This means war.
What the hell?
- l like to be hugged.
- Go--Jesus!
Aaah!
Aw, you gotta be fucking kidding' me.
The man lives through two tours in Nam... and then one night he just drops dead.
Doesn't make any sense.
At ease.
We will now take a moment of silence to honor Colonel Cochrane.
He was a fine man and he will be sorely missed.
Bowyour heads for prayer.
Take...seats!
It's gettin' pretty shaggy, Carlson.
I want to seeyou on Friday.
Monday, Fabrizzio.
Yes, sir.
My man.
Tuesday.
Look atyou, Whitehurst.
You're a disgrace.
When's the last time you had a trim?
Two weeks ago, Sergeant, I think.
I want to seeyou right after breakfast.
Yes, sir, Sergeant Botnick, sir.
What'reyou looking at, new boy?
Wednesday.
Barclay, what're you doi ng?
You can't just get up in the middle of mess.
Major.
At ease!
Tyler.
H i, Barclay.
What's up?
I've got to talk to you about Chucky.
Have you seen him?
Not since last night.
He's hiding somewhere.
He's gonna lay low until he knows you're alone, and he's gonna come after you.
He wants to play.
Listen to me.
No matter what he says, no matter what he promises you, you've gotta stay away from him.
Don't let him fool you.
He's bad.
Charles isn't bad, he's a Good Guy.
It says so on his shirt.
He lies, Tyler.
He's hurt a lot of people.
I think colonel Cochrane was one of them.
You're just jealous because he's my best friend now instead of yours.
Look, you better keep this.
Whitehurst, you are, without a doubt the sorriest excuse for a soldier to ever
Face it, you're not cut out for this life.
Why don't you do yourself a favor and get lf l had any choice in the matter, I would, sir.
Smart ass.
Presto... you're bald.
What the hell?
How'd you get in there?
That haircut ain't regulation, soldier.
When's the last time you had a trim, huh?
Kiss it good-bye.
Presto...
you're dead.
Ha,ha,ha,ha.
It's definitelyyou.
Ha,ha,ha,ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
I just forgot my --
Boo!
The annual war games... have been an unbroken tradition here at Kent for over 50 years.
Colonel Cochrane was a man who believe in tradition.
He not only would have wanted us to go on,
He'd have ordered us to go on.
Therefore...
The war games.... will proceed as scheduled.
Lieutenant Colonel Shelton..
will command the blue team.
Major Rawlings will head up the reds.
The obiective is simple.
To capture the other team's flag... and bring it back here safely to base.
Rawlings.
You will pick up your weapons... in the armoy before moving out.
You will be using the standard issue Springfield aught-three.
Your ammo--
Shelton.
If you get hit, you are dead.
Hike back to base.
Commanders..
take charge of your teams.
May the best team win.
Good luck, men and women.
Nice of you to join us.
Looks like Botnick's in a pretty bad mood today.
What's wrong?
Nothing.
Nothing's wrong.
I'm fine.
Nothing's wrong.
This oughta slow the pricks down.
Left, left, left.
Here we goagain.
Here we go again.
Same old stuffagain.
Same old stuffagain.
Marching down the avenue.
Marching down the avenue.
Two more miles and we'll be through.
Two more miles and we'll be through.
I'll be gettin' rid of you.
I'll be gettin' rid ofyou.
Same old ugly stum.
Same old ugly stuff.
Here we go again.
Herewe go again.
Marching down the avenue.
Marching down the avenue.
One more mile and we'll be through.
One more mile and we'll be through.
I'll be gettin' rid of you.
What's going on, Whitehurst?
You saw something, didn't you?
You saw Chucky.
Don't wimp out on me!
I need your help.
That kid needs your help.
Okay?
I didn't see anything at all.
Your left, right, your left.
Your militay left.
Ellis, let's make sure all the perimeters are secure.
She checks the windows.
And the baby-sitter hears this thump, thump, thumping.
Like something's being dragged across the floor upstairs.
Suddenly she thinks, "l haven't checed on the children"
So she hurries to the top of the stairs, and when she gets there... she sees her boyfriend completely dismembered, dragging himself across the floor by his chin.
Thump, slide.
Thump, slide.
Thump, slide.
Hey, you guys, I got a better story... and it's true.
It's about this mental institution... and it's a few miles away from here.
Hey.
Hope it wasn't something I said.
No. I'm sory.
Where doyou think the red team's camped out?
Could be anywhere.
Shelton'll find 'em, he always does.
By the way, you can call me Kristin.
What?
Kristin.
It's my first name.
Do you have one?
Andy.
Come on, Andy.
I want to show you something.
Pretty cool, huh?
Yeah, I almost forgot there were places like that... where peoplejust go to have fun.
listen!
Somebody's out there.
It's probably just a chipmunk or something.
Nothing scares you, does it?
No.
Man, I really got to get out of this body.
I'm going afterTyler.
Are you crazy?
You'll never find him.
Wanna bet?
I swiped this from Shelton's tent.
He sent out a reconnaissance mission right before we pitched camp.
The red team is somewhere around here.
That kid's a sitting duck, Whitehurst.
Are you with me... or not?
I'm sory, I can't.
Up and at 'em, ladies.
We're movin' out.
I want this camp to be a ghost town in five minutes.
I thought we weren't going till dawn, sir.
Someone stole the reconnaissance map, so we're making our move now.
Get going, Hanley.
You wouldn't know anything about a missing map, would you?
Where the hell's Barclay?
Whitehurst!
Colonel Shelton, you better have a look in here, sir.
What is it, Ellis?
Barclay's gone AWOL, sir.
He stole the map.
That little fucking traitor's doubling for the reds.
Where's Tyler?
He went AWOL with
Where's Andy?
Whitehurst, where is he?
Platoon, halt!
All right.
De Silva, you're gonna take the right flank.
Siegel, take the left.
Check in on the radio
Yes, sir.
All right, move it.
The rest ofus are gonna spread out and meet up
Move out.
Whitehurst, move!
Thanks for coming after me.
What are friend for?
Duck!
That was a close one.
Now we can play "Hide the soul"
I'm tired. I don't wanna play that dumb game anymore.
You're a fuckin' drag, you know that?
- Watch your mouth, Charles.
- Stop calling me that!
What's the knife for?
A good soldier is always prepared.
Barclay was right.
You're not a good guy.
Sorry kid.
You got me.
I'm bad
Now..
assume the position.
No!
Aaah!
Get back here!
Barclay!
Barclay!
Tyler!
You fuckin' traitor.
Give me my map!
Listen -- You got any idea what we
Tyler's in trouble.
Whitehurst, back me up.
Major Ellis, call in the flanks.
De Silva, Siegel, do you copy?
De Silva, do you copy?
De Silva, come in.
Aaah!
Siegel's on his way back.
No word yet from De Silva.
Keep tryin'.
Yes, sir.
Help!
Tyler!
Barclay!
Are you okay,
Looks like we got ourselves a little P.O.W.
Charles is bad.
He tried to hurt me.
Who the hell Charles?
Come in, Barclay.
It's Charles.
Who is this?
Put Barclay on,
It's the reds.
They're up to something.
What do you want?
I want the kid.
Bring him up to the old Jeep or there'll be hell to pay.
Andy, don't do it.
You hear that, Barclay?
Don't touch her,
Now bring me the kid or I'll waste her.
Red team, red team.
come in, red team.
This is red team, over.
We got a situation up
Blue team sighted.
Advise you to move your troops in.
Hope they like the taste of lead.
Now just sit back and watch the sparks fly.
All right, you two are gonna go on up ahead.
The rest ofus are gonna circle around.
Shelton, this is no game.
This guy is dangerous.
Relax, Barclay, it's only paint.
All right, All right let's do it.
I'm scared, Barclay.
Yeah, me too.
All right, kid.
Get over here!
No!
Don't fuck with me!
I'll blow all of you to pieces.
Beat it!
Now just get down and shut up.
Yeah!
Ow!
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
De Silva, where the hell is eveybody?
Hi, soldier.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Fuck me.
All right!
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Shit!
Stay down!
They're using live rounds!
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Hold your fire!
Oh, God, he's not breathing!
Get away from him!
You did this, didn't you?
You sick son of a bitch.
Now I'm gonna kill you!
Get off of him, he didn't do it!
Sayonara, suckers.
Look out!
No!
Oh, my God, what happened?
What the hell happened?
Who fucked with the rifles?
Get Clark on the radio... and get me a medic up here right now!
All right, eveybody stay calm.
Epstein, I want that radio!
Oh, God.
This is the last time I'm gonna tell you
Give that thing a rest or you're out of here, both of you.
We're not bothering anybody.
You're bothering me.
Geez!
Mister, you gotta help me!
What's wrong?
Charles, Charles
Who's Charles?
He's a Good Guy.
Have a seat over there.
Are you from Kent?
What's your name, son?
Ronald Tyler.
Private first class, sir.
Have a seat.
How 'bout some gum, Private?
I know how it must hurt... when a friend does something bad to you.
Sure does.
But I bet your friend -- what's his name, Charles?
I bet you Charles didn't mean it.
I bet you he's really sorry.
No, he isn't.
He wants to hurt me.
Nobody's gonna hurt you.
I know what'll cheer you up.
Look what I found.
There you go.
Thank you, Daddy.
Let's go on the Super Loop.
Hey, maybe somebody's seen him.
Oh, God.
Come on.
Wait.
Mommy, Mommy, I love it!
Were you scared?
No!
Let's have some popcorn and we'll go on one more ride.
Perfect.

(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)
MAN: (SINGING) Tell me, Doctor, where are we going this time?
Is this the '50s
Or 1999?
All I wanted to do
Was play my guitar and sing
So take me away I don't mind
But you better promise me I'll be back in time
Gotta get back in time
I'll be back in time
Gotta get back in time
That's me, Doc Brown in the 1920s.
Well, it's actually the me of the 1990s, in the 1920s.
The purpose of my journey?
To meet one of my biggest idols, and one of the most brilliant inventors of all time Thomas Edison.
Inventor of the phonograph, the motion picture camera and the electric light bulb.
And he gave me an autograph.
Talk about a collector's item!
(SHATTERS)
Personal note to myself.
Plan a return trip to meet Thomas Edison, and bring extra light bulbs.
The 1920s, also known as the Roaring Twenties.
A time of flappers, fads and films.
Silent films, that is.
I'm sure you've all heard of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, but only the real film historians among you recall Daredevil Brown.
Talk about a Hollywood success story!
And it all began, curiously enough, with a fishing trip.
(DOC HUMMING) (ELECTRICITY CRACKLING)
(SMACKS LIPS)
All right!
He's in a good mood.
One automatically water-proofed pair of tennis shoes coming up.
(EXPLOSION)
(COUGHING)
(SIZZLING)
Hmm...
Perhaps a fast food franchise would be interested.
Hey, Pop, check it out.
Let's see, this Saturday... (GULPS) Father and Son Big Mouth Bass-Off?
Sorry, Verne, but I can't go... (UNINTELLIGIBLE)
(YELLING) (THUDS)
Fish.
The word is fish.
Behold, Father.
My Uni-view allows television observation without annoying others in the room.
Anything to get my mind off of...
Oh, well, never mind.
An old Andy Griffith re-broadcast is about to commence.
Andy and Opie are going... (MUMBLING)
Hey, Dad.
What you got against fishing'?
Don't say that word!
What's with Pop?
I'm not sure.
Perhaps tonight when he's asleep, we can discover the problem.
(DOOR OPENS) (SNORING)
What's the doohickey?
An otoscope used for ear examinations.
You think too much wax is driving Pops wackeroo?
Negative.
I have modified the device into a cerebrum observator, allowing us to actually view Father's thoughts.
(BEEPING)
(YELLING)
(GRUNTING)
Observe, one of Father's unfinished thoughts.
(SQUELCHING)
What's that stinking thing?
I presume it to be one of Father's brainstorms.
Then those must be brain waves.
Regard, Father's vast library of knowledge.
Hey, Jules, this one's overdue.
(VERNE LAUGHING) (GRUNTS)
BOTH:
"No admittance.
Keep out.
"This means you."
Euripedes!
A memory block dating back to August 5, 1926.
Father's childhood.
Let us see if we can chip it away.
(CLANGING)
(CRACKING) JULES:
Success!
Now to observe what Father has chosen to forget.
VERNE:
Hey, there's Pop.
He used to like fishing.
(SPLASHING)
Gadzooks!
Assistance requested!
(COUGHING)
(SPLASHING)
So that's why he hates fishing.
JULES:
We must return to 1926 and prevent Father from falling into that stream.
Oucha-ma-goucha!
A migraine and a nocturnal-mare all rolled into one!
JULES:
Silence is imperative so as not to awaken Mother and Father.
Yeah, but how come I have to push?
Don't be absurd, brother.
You're much too young to drive.
MARTY:
Hey, what are you little punks doing?
JULES:
Martin?
I just came over to get my hoverboard.
Where are you off to?
Milwaukee, to prevent one of Father's mishaps when he was four years old.
Milwaukee?
That must've been when Doc stayed with his Oddball Uncle Oliver.
Just don't fink on us.
All right, I won't...
If you'll let me come along.
I'd love to be smarter than Doc for a change.
(EXPLOSION)
MARTY: (CHUCKLING) I mean, how much can a little kid know?
VERNE:
There's Dad now.
JULES:
Why don't you ask him?
Hey, you kid.
What do you know?
Several languages, the Periodic Table, the constellations of the Northern Hemisphere and the Encyclopedia from "A" to "Grrr."
(THUDDING)
You might want to brush up on casting.
I will if Uncle Oliver ever comes down and takes me fishing like he promised.
Comes down from where?
Soon the world record for flagpole sitting is mine.
Ach Dulieber!
Look at that!
A flock of adoring fans is beginning to congregate!
What is he, a pigeon?
Looks more like a loon.
Perhaps you fellows might convince Uncle Oliver to take me fishing.
Yes, but how do you propose we speak with him?
Hey, I've got an idea that just might fly.
Shoo, shoo!
(BIRD SQUAWKING)
Vas is das?
Uncle Ollie, hi!
Yeah, well, you certainly are.
Care for a bite of Wiener schnitzel?
No, thanks.
But about your nephew, Emmett.
You promised to take him fishing today.
OLIVER:
When I'm rich und famous, I'll take him whaling.
How about if Emmett goes fishing with me and my friends?
OLIVER:
Ja, just have him home by 6:00 for sauerkraut and cabbage.
(CRASHING)
Nice sunroof.
Ouch!
Hold it!
Emmett, perhaps you should stand over here.
Jules, you're crazy.
This looks like a great spot to fish.
Whoa!
(SPLASHING)
BOTH:
Told you so.
Holy mackerel, that fall gave me a haddock.
(CHUCKLING)
Now, Emmett, the secret to successful casting is snapping your wrist.
Like this?
Great Scott!
Now, that's what I call fly fishing!
Holy bovine!
Eine more minute and I've set the record.
Emmett!
(TICKING)
Stop, you crazy Kinders!
I thought you were going to watch my Emmett.
We're watching.
He's putting on a great show.
Galloping Galileo!
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
Jeepers, this is the best stunt flying I've ever seen!
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
OLIVER:
Nephew, are you all right?
FLICKERS:
All right?
He's sensational!
And I got it all on film.
Kid, you're gonna be a star!
Und I'll be his manager!
All I wanted was to go fishing.
Hey, it's Emmett!
Shh!
Aw, don't get your shorts in a wad.
It's a silent movie!
Is there any other kind?
(JULES READING)
(CHEERING)
That's my little liebchin!
Why, it's Emmett Brown in the flesh!
Yeah, that's what holds him together.
Sir, I'm Harvey Wannamaker, famous Hollywood talent scout.
Sign on the dotted line and that kid will make millions.
Jawohl, mein Herr!
Hollywood, here we come!
Hollywood?
Cool!
(BOTH YELLING)
Not so cool.
We have forever altered Father's life!
He may never meet Mother, and we would cease to exist.
That's one way to stop you from picking' on me.
Brother, that is disgusting!
It's mine, skunkhead!
Hey, hey!
Chill out, you two.
We've got to stick close to little Doc and Oddball Uncle Ollie to make sure things don't get worse.
Ugh!
There's only one problem.
How do we get to Hollywood?
Perhaps we may be of assistance!
LITTLE DOC:
A car that transforms into a zeppelin!
Brilliant idea.
Stinking brag about it why don't you?
(CROWD LAUGHING)
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
(BOY READING)
REPORTER:
Yes, the nation has gone Daredevil Brown crazy!
People all over America are reading Daredevil Brown comics, drinking Daredevil Brown soda, and buying every Daredevil Brown product from soup to nuts!
I'll give you two Babe Ruths and an autographed Ty Cobb for your Daredevil Brown.
Have you flipped your lid?
Nobody gets my Emmett!
Oddball Uncle Oliver, are you sure this is the best thing for little Emmett?
Oh, Jawohl!
The Kinder's getting a bang out of it!

Uncle, may I swim in the pool with my friends?
Nein, you might get hurt.
Save it for the cameras.
Aw, for Petri's sake!
I'll be in my room.
Uh, Uncle Ollie, do you really think Emmett is enjoying all this?
Ugh!
What's not to enjoy?
He's rich, he's famous, and the air in Hollywood is so clean!
But the little dude is bummed out.
Ja, maybe you are right.
Hmm.
We've had our fun.
Perhaps I shall return to Milwaukee with little Emmett.
(TELEPHONE RINGING)
Ja.
Ja.
Uh-huh.
Ja.
Jawohl!
Just as soon as he performs one last stunt.
Daredevil Brown is going over America's tallest waterfall.
OLIVER:
In a barrel!
(SINGING) Now you're doing the Daredevil Brown
VERNE:
Man, this makes Super Splash Water World look like a leaky faucet!
LITTLE DOC:
Estimating the falls' height at 2,425 feet and utilizing Newton's formula for acceleration due to gravity,
I'll be traveling approximately 268 miles per hour upon impact.
I'll bet that barrel doesn't even have an air-bag.
(POPPING) What kind of blockhead would make up such a stupid, stinking stunt?
Boys, I'd like you to meet the man responsible for all this...
Herr D.W. Tannen!
MARTY:
I should've known.
Uncle Oliver, I'm somewhat hesitant about this particular feat.
Emmett, baby.
It's movie magic.
You don't really go over the falls.
We use a dummy.
MARTY:
Oh, you're going to do it?
(CHORTLES)
What are you, an extra?
You're fired.
Look, sweetie, here's the trap door.
It's a fix.
You duck down and shove a dummy into the barrel.
Boogie, boogie, boogie!
Ooh!
(CHORTLES) Oh, I'm in stitches.
You're fired.
Daredevil, sweetheart, 20 minutes until we roll.
Let's be a good boy and slip into your costume.
Or you're fired.
TANNEN:
Are you sure you got it?
Uh, yeah.
I open the trap door, make sure the Daredevil switches with the dummy and then send the barrel over the edge.
(SCOFFS) No.
That's just a load of banana oil for the punk's goofball uncle.
I want that kid inside the barrel.
This has got to look like the real McDonald!
Uh, you mean the real McCoy?
Yeah?
You're fired.
Jumpin' gigawatts!
They're going to make us orphans before we're even born!
I'm formulating a notion, but we'll need some time.
Martin, are you able to walk a straight line?
Oh, sure.
Although I enjoy a good curve now and then.
(YELLING)
(THUDDING) MARTY:
Ouch!
TANNEN:
You're fired!
TANNEN:
Welcome, one and all, to the most dangerous stunt ever performed by boy or man!
And you can see this feat of derring-do in the...
My fabulous feature film...
Raging Death Doom, D. W. Tanner, producer.
And now, my closest friend, Daredevil Brown!
(CHEERING AND APPLAUSE)
JULES:
Wait!
First, an added attraction!
Tightrope walking across the falls will be none other than...
Courageous Clyde!
(HESITANT CLAPPING)
Thank you, thank you.
It all began when I was born.
I was just a baby at the time...
Verne, your wad of bubble gum, please?
MARTY: (NERVOUSLY) That's a joke, folks.
Uh, hello?
This disgusting yet sticky substance will provide Martin with a strong center of balance.
And while he's out there, I'll equip Emmett's barrel with this spare Flux Capacitor.
Cool!
Where you going to send him?
Not him.
You.
...it was then and there I knew the tightrope was for me.
Quit stalling.
Get out there!
Whoa!
One of these days I'll learn to stay home...
In the 1990s!
(YELLING)
(SIGHS) I never thought I'd be so happy to have gum stuck on my shoes.
Hey!
Remind me to fire this creampuff.
Get the kid and the barrel.
Ta-da!
JULES:
You're the spitting image of your father.
Okay, short-stuff, it's show time.
Hop in.
Ready when you are, D.W.
And now, Daredevil Brown will go over upper Yosemite Falls in a barrel!
(CHEERING)
Auf Wiedersehen, Emmy!
Hey, boss, what should I do with this dummy?
Dummy?
Relax, Unc.
If he doesn't make it, we'll shoot a movie about his life story.
(CHUCKLES) It's got a great ending.
(GASPING) You would jeopardize the safety of a child for a movie?
You did.
And, don't touch the suit!
Nephew, come back!
Uncle Oliver, didn't you just eat?
Oh, I've got you, Emmett!
(YELLING)
Hope this catch doesn't put me over my limit.
Whoa!
(ALL GASPING)
(YELLING) Emmett, no!
(BEEPING)
To attain 88 miles per hour, an object must free fall 259 feet.
(ALL GASPING)
Emmett!
I lost my little Emmett!
Here I am, Uncle Oliver!
Emmett!
I'll make him more famous than Houdini!
Hey, Ollie, baby.
Sign here.
Take your contract und go jump in a lake, you big galoot!
(SPLASHING)
You'll never eat breakfast in this town again!
TANNEN:
And you're fired!
Say, Daredevil, can we have a statement for your fans?
(FILM ROLLING) Sorry, but Daredevil has retired so little Emmett and I can go fishing!
Might I suggest a pond just upstream?
Hey!
I'm starting to wrinkle up like a prune out here!
LITTLE DOC:
Fishing with you is fun, Uncle Oliver.
I was a dummkopf not to take you sooner.
Oucha-ma-goucha!
Peculiar expression of discomfort, although it has a nice ring to it.
If my calculations are correct, we have four, three, two, one... (EXPLODING)
Definitely better than Super Splash Water World!
DOC:
Elevate and illuminate!
Only one more day of the Hill Valley Father and Son Big Mouth Bass-Off!
Whoo-hoo!
Father, I was under the impression that you disliked fishing.
Galloping Galileo, Oddball Uncle Oliver and I were fishing fools!
Did I ever regale you of the time I caught an airplane?
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Auto-iris adjusting.
You're on, Doctor Brown.
Doctor Emmett Brown, here.
I was quite a little whippersnapper in the old days, wasn't I?
Even at a young age I was well versed in Newton's laws of gravity.
And as you saw, that knowledge came in quite handy.
Just what did Newton know about gravity?
Let's take a look.
Access video encyclopedia, section "G" for gravity.
COMPUTER:
Section "G." Entry, "Gravity."
DOC:
Sir Isaac Newton was the first scientist to quantify gravity.
He figured out that gravity could be perfectly described by using math.
In fact, it was out of his work with gravity that Newton invented calculus.
And if you don't know what that is yet, don't worry, you'll find out.
Newton figured out that regardless of size or weight, objects always fall at a consistent rate.
Well, let's test Mr. Newton's little theory.
Here we have an ordinary apple, and an equally ordinary bowling ball.
The apple weighs about a quarter pound and the bowling ball 15 pounds.
Both are suspended by this mechanism at a height of exactly five feet.
We'll release both objects simultaneously and if Mr. Newton's law is correct, they should hit the ground at precisely the same instant.
(THUDDING)
Pretty amazing, huh?
Let's watch that one in slow motion.
There they are on the platform.
The string is yanked and...
Whoo!
Look at them go!
They hit at the exact same moment.
(THUD)
So, as you can see, Newton's laws of gravity are as relevant today as they were when he discovered them.
Two objects of different weight and size are affected by gravity in the same way.
Pretty heavy, huh?
(APPLE CRUNCHING)
(GRUNTS)
Now that's heavy!
(SPLUTTERING) See you in the future.
(JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING)
Stumble, bumble, do some belly flops
Fumble, tumble, until your body drops
Everybody, stand up
Everybody, fall down
Now you're doing the Daredevil
Everybody, Daredevil
Now you're doing the Daredevil Brown
Hello, music lovers.
(PIANO TINKLING)
Today's question, what is the difference between a piano and a fish?
(PIANO TINKLING)
You can tune a piano, but you can't "tuna fish."
(LAUGHING)
Why you...
Ugh!
Tell me, Doctor, where are we going this time?
Is this the '50s
Or 1999?
All I wanted to do
Was play my guitar and sing
So take me away I don't mind
But you better promise me I'll be back in time
Gotta get back in time
I'll be back in time
Gotta get back in time
That's me, Doc Brown in the 1920s.
Well, it's actually the me of the 1990s, in the 1920s.
The purpose of my journey?
To meet one of my biggest idols, and one of the most brilliant inventors of all time Thomas Edison.
Inventor of the phonograph, the motion picture camera and the electric light bulb.
And he gave me an autograph.
Talk about a collector's item!
Personal note to myself.
Plan a return trip to meet Thomas Edison, and bring extra light bulbs.
The 1920s, also known as the Roaring Twenties.
A time of flappers, fads and films.
Silent films, that is.
I'm sure you've all heard of Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton, but only the real film historians among you recall Daredevil Brown.
Talk about a Hollywood success story!
And it all began, curiously enough, with a fishing trip.
All right!
He's in a good mood.
One automatically water-proofed pair of tennis shoes coming up.
Hmm...
Perhaps a fast food franchise would be interested.
Hey, Pop, check it out.
Let's see, this Saturday...
Father and Son Big Mouth Bass-Off?
Sorry, Verne, but I can't go...
Fish.
The word is fish.
Behold, Father.
My Uni-view allows television observation without annoying others in the room.
Anything to get my mind off of...
Oh, well, never mind.
An old Andy Griffith re-broadcast is about to commence.
Andy and Opie are going...
Hey, Dad.
What you got against fishing'?
Don't say that word!
What's with Pop?
I'm not sure.
Perhaps tonight when he's asleep, we can discover the problem.
What's the doohickey?
An otoscope used for ear examinations.
You think too much wax is driving Pops wackeroo?
Negative.
I have modified the device into a cerebrum observator, allowing us to actually view Father's thoughts.
Observe, one of Father's unfinished thoughts.
What's that stinking thing?
I presume it to be one of Father's brainstorms.
Then those must be brain waves.
Regard, Father's vast library of knowledge.
Hey, Jules, this one's overdue.
"No admittance.
Keep out.
"This means you."
Euripedes!
A memory block dating back to August 5, 1926.
Father's childhood.
Let us see if we can chip it away.
Success!
Now to observe what Father has chosen to forget.
Hey, there's Pop.
He used to like fishing.
Gadzooks!
Assistance requested!
So that's why he hates fishing.
We must return to 1926 and prevent Father from falling into that stream.
Oucha-ma-goucha!
A migraine and a nocturnal-mare all rolled into one!
Silence is imperative so as not to awaken Mother and Father.
Yeah, but how come I have to push?
Don't be absurd, brother.
You're much too young to drive.
Hey, what are you little punks doing?
Martin?
I just came over to get my hoverboard.
Where are you off to?
Milwaukee, to prevent one of Father's mishaps when he was four years old.
Milwaukee?
That must've been when Doc stayed with his Oddball Uncle Oliver.
Just don't fink on us.
All right, I won't...
If you'll let me come along.
I'd love to be smarter than Doc for a change.
I mean, how much can a little kid know?
There's Dad now.
Why don't you ask him?
Hey, you kid.
What do you know?
Several languages, the Periodic Table, the constellations of the Northern Hemisphere and the Encyclopedia from "A" to "Grrr."
You might want to brush up on casting.
I will if Uncle Oliver ever comes down and takes me fishing like he promised.
Comes down from where?
Soon the world record for flagpole sitting is mine.
Ach Dulieber!
Look at that!
A flock of adoring fans is beginning to congregate!
What is he, a pigeon?
Looks more like a loon.
Perhaps you fellows might convince Uncle Oliver to take me fishing.
Yes, but how do you propose we speak with him?
Hey, I've got an idea that just might fly.
Shoo, shoo!
Vas is das?
Uncle Ollie, hi!
Yeah, well, you certainly are.
Care for a bite of Wiener schnitzel?
No, thanks.
But about your nephew, Emmett.
You promised to take him fishing today.
When I'm rich und famous, I'll take him whaling.
How about if Emmett goes fishing with me and my friends?
Ja, just have him home by 6:00 for sauerkraut and cabbage.
Nice sunroof.
Ouch!
Hold it!
Emmett, perhaps you should stand over here.
Jules, you're crazy.
This looks like a great spot to fish.
Whoa!
Told you so.
Holy mackerel, that fall gave me a haddock.
Now, Emmett, the secret to successful casting is snapping your wrist.
Like this?
Great Scott!
Now, that's what I call fly fishing!
Holy bovine!
Eine more minute and I've set the record.
Emmett!
Stop, you crazy Kinders!
I thought you were going to watch my Emmett.
We're watching.
He's putting on a great show.
Galloping Galileo!
Jeepers, this is the best stunt flying I've ever seen!
Nephew, are you all right?
All right?
He's sensational!
And I got it all on film.
Kid, you're gonna be a star!
Und I'll be his manager!
All I wanted was to go fishing.
Hey, it's Emmett!
Shh!
Aw, don't get your shorts in a wad.
It's a silent movie!
Is there any other kind?
That's my little liebchin!
Why, it's Emmett Brown in the flesh!
Yeah, that's what holds him together.
Sir, I'm Harvey Wannamaker, famous Hollywood talent scout.
Sign on the dotted line and that kid will make millions.
Jawohl, mein Herr!
Hollywood, here we come!
Hollywood?
Cool!
Not so cool.
We have forever altered Father's life!
He may never meet Mother, and we would cease to exist.
That's one way to stop you from picking' on me.
Brother, that is disgusting!
It's mine, skunkhead!
Hey, hey!
Chill out, you two.
We've got to stick close to little Doc and Oddball Uncle Ollie to make sure things don't get worse.
Ugh!
There's only one problem.
How do we get to Hollywood?
Perhaps we may be of assistance!
A car that transforms into a zeppelin!
Brilliant idea.
Stinking brag about it why don't you?
Yes, the nation has gone Daredevil Brown crazy!
People all over America are reading Daredevil Brown comics, drinking Daredevil Brown soda, and buying every Daredevil Brown product from soup to nuts!
I'll give you two Babe Ruths and an autographed Ty Cobb for your Daredevil Brown.
Have you flipped your lid?
Nobody gets my Emmett!
Oddball Uncle Oliver, are you sure this is the best thing for little Emmett?
Oh, Jawohl!
The Kinder's getting a bang out of it!
Little Em has given me the courage to fly solo across the Atlantic.
And I'm taking my brother with me!
Joe, give me an Emmett.
Next!
Spread your arms straight out like an airplane wing
Sway back and forth like a trapeze swing
Roll and flip and slip around
Now you're doin' the Daredevil Brown
Uncle, may I swim in the pool with my friends?
Nein, you might get hurt.
Save it for the cameras.
Aw, for Petri's sake!
I'll be in my room.
Uh, Uncle Ollie, do you really think Emmett is enjoying all this?
Ugh!
What's not to enjoy?
He's rich, he's famous, and the air in Hollywood is so clean!
But the little dude is bummed out.
Ja, maybe you are right.
Hmm.
We've had our fun.
Perhaps I shall return to Milwaukee with little Emmett.
Ja.
Ja.
Uh-huh.
Ja.
Jawohl!
Just as soon as he performs one last stunt.
Daredevil Brown is going over America's tallest waterfall.
In a barrel!
Now you're doing the Daredevil Brown
Man, this makes Super Splash Water World look like a leaky faucet!
Estimating the falls' height at 2,425 feet and utilizing Newton's formula for acceleration due to gravity,
I'll be traveling approximately 268 miles per hour upon impact.
I'll bet that barrel doesn't even have an air-bag.
What kind of blockhead would make up such a stupid, stinking stunt?
Boys, I'd like you to meet the man responsible for all this...
Herr D.W. Tannen!
I should've known.
Uncle Oliver, I'm somewhat hesitant about this particular feat.
Emmett, baby.
It's movie magic.
You don't really go over the falls.
We use a dummy.
Oh, you're going to do it?
What are you, an extra?
You're fired.
Look, sweetie, here's the trap door.
It's a fix.
You duck down and shove a dummy into the barrel.
Boogie, boogie, boogie!
Ooh!
Oh, I'm in stitches.
You're fired.
Daredevil, sweetheart, 20 minutes until we roll.
Let's be a good boy and slip into your costume.
Or you're fired.
Are you sure you got it?
Uh, yeah.
I open the trap door, make sure the Daredevil switches with the dummy and then send the barrel over the edge.
No.
That's just a load of banana oil for the punk's goofball uncle.
I want that kid inside the barrel.
This has got to look like the real McDonald!
Uh, you mean the real McCoy?
Yeah?
You're fired.
Jumpin' gigawatts!
They're going to make us orphans before we're even born!
I'm formulating a notion, but we'll need some time.

Oh, sure.
Although I enjoy a good curve now and then.
Ouch!

Welcome, one and all, to the most dangerous stunt ever performed by boy or man!

Courageous Clyde!
Thank you, thank you.
It all began when I was born.
I was just a baby at the time...
Verne, your wad of bubble gum, please?
That's a joke, folks.
Uh, hello?
This disgusting yet sticky substance will provide Martin with a strong center of balance.
And while he's out there, I'll equip Emmett's barrel with this spare Flux Capacitor.
Cool!
Where you going to send him?
Not him.
You.

Quit stalling.

Ugh!
Captain's log U.S.S. Excelsior.
Hikaru Sulu commanding.
After three years I've concluded my first assignment as master of this vessel cataloguing gaseous planetary anomalies in Beta Quadrant.
We're heading home under full impulse power.
I'm pleased to report that ship and crew have functioned well.
According to this, we've completed our survey of the entire sector.
I have an energy wave at 240 degrees mark six port.
Visual!
My...
God!
Shields.
Shields!
She's not answering her helm.
Starboard thrusters.
Turn her into the wave.
Go to impulse power.
- Damage report.
- Checking all systems.
- That was no meteor shower.
- Negative, sir.
The sub-space shock-wave originated at bearing 323.75.
Location...
It's Praxis, sir.
It's a Klingon moon.
Praxis is their key energy production facility.
Send to Klingon High Command. "This is Excelsior, a Federation Starship."
"We have monitored a large explosion in your sector."
- "Do you require assistance?"
- Aye, sir.
- Mr Vultane, any more data?
- I've confirmed Praxis' location, but...
- I cannot confirm Praxis' existence.
- On screen.
- Magnify.
- Computer enhancement.
- Praxis?
- What's left of it, sir.
Captain, I'm getting a message from Praxis.
Let's have it.
This is Brigadier Kerla, speaking for the High Command.
There has been an incident on Praxis.
However, everything is under control.
We have no need for assistance.
Obey treaty stipulations and remain outside the Neutral Zone.
This transmission ends now.
- An incident?
- Do we report this, sir?
Are you kidding?
- What are we doing here?
- Maybe it's a retirement party.
That suits me.
I just bought a boat.
I'm supposed to be chairing a seminar at the Academy.
- Isn't this just for top brass?
- Where is Sulu?
Captain Sulu?
On assignment.
Where's Spock?
This briefing is classified.
Ladies and gentlemen, the C-in-C.
As you were.
I'll break this information down succinctly.
The Klingon empire has 50 years of life left.
For full details, I'm turning this briefing over to Federation Special Envoy.
Good morning.
Two months ago a Federation Starship monitored an explosion on Praxis.
We believe it was caused by over-mining and insufficient safety precautions.
The moon's decimation means deadly pollution of their ozone.
They will have depleted their oxygen supply in 50 Earth years.
Due to their enormous military budget the Klingon economy doesn't have the resources to combat this catastrophe.
Last month, at the behest of the Vulcan Ambassador, -
- I opened a dialogue with Gorkon, Chancellor of the Klingon High Council.
He proposes to commence negotiations at once.
Negotiations for what?
The dismantling of our space stations and bases along the Neutral Zone, an end to 70 years of hostility, which the Klingons can no longer afford.
Bill, are we talking about mothballing the Starfleet?
Our exploration and scientific programs would be unaffected, but...
I must protest!
To offer Klingons safe haven within Federation space is suicide.
Klingons would become the alien trash of the galaxy.
If we dismantle the fleet, we'd be defenceless before an aggressive species on our territory.
The opportunity here is to bring them to their knees.
Then we'll be in a better position to dictate terms.
- Sir...
- Captain Kirk?
The Klingons have never been trustworthy.
I agree with Admiral Cartwright.
This is a terrifying idea.
It is imperative that we act now to support the Gorkon initiative, lest more conservative elements persuade his empire that it's better to attempt a military solution and die fighting.
You, Captain Kirk, are to be our first olive branch.
We are to rendezvous with the vessel which is bringing Gorkon to Earth and to escort him safely through Federation space.
Me?
There are Klingons who feel the same about the peace treaty as yourself, but they'll think twice about attacking the Enterprise under your command.
I have personally vouched for you in this matter.
You have personally vouched...?
You will extend Chancellor Gorkon full diplomatic courtesy, Captain.
- A full Ambassador is better equipped...
- If there's no further business I wish you and your crew Godspeed.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
I remind you this meeting is classified.
I don't know whether to congratulate you or not, Jim.
I wouldn't.
We volunteered?
There's an old Vulcan proverb.
"Only Nixon could go to China."
How could you vouch for me?
- That's arrogant presumption.
- My father requested that I open...
I know your father is the Vulcan Ambassador, but you know how I feel.
- They're animals.
- Jim...
- There is an historic opportunity here.
- Don't believe them!
Don't trust them.
- They're dying.
- Let them die.
Has it occurred to you that this crew is due to stand down in three months?
We've done our bit for king and country.
You should have trusted me.
Control, this is S-D 103, approach to Space dock.
Over.
You are clear to deliver Captain Kirk and party to N.C.C. 1701 Alpha.
- Captain on the bridge!
- As you were.
Lieutenant?
Val'eris, sir.
We were told you needed a helmsman, so I volunteered.
It is agreeable to see you again.
She was the first Vulcan to graduate at the top of her class at the Academy.
- You must be very proud.
- I don't believe so, sir.
She's a Vulcan, alright.
Let's get this over with.
Departure stations.
- Scotty?
Did you find the engine room?
- Right where I left it.
Stand by.
Uhura, get me the dock master.
Control tower reading, sir.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
This is Control.
Permission to depart granted. 30 seconds for port gates.
- Clear all moorings.
- Awaiting port gates from this mark.
- All lines clear.
- Aft thrusters.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
1 quarter impulse power.
Captain, regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock.
Jim...
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
Aye, sir.
Captain's log.
Stardate 9522.6.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I can never forgive them for the death of my boy.
To escort the Chancellor of the Klingon High Council to a peace summit is problematic, at best.
Spock says this could be an historic occasion.
I'd like to believe him.
But how on Earth can history get past people like me?
- Sorry.
- You could have knocked.
We are almost at the rendezvous, sir.
I thought that you would like to know.
Permission to speak freely, sir.
It is an honour to serve with you.
You piloted well out of space dock, Lieutenant.
I've always wanted to try that.
You've done well, Val'eris.
As your sponsor at the Academy I've followed your career with satisfaction.
And as a Vulcan, you have exceeded my expectations.
I do not understand this representation.
It's a depiction from ancient Earth mythology.
"The expulsion from Paradise."
- Why keep it in your quarters?
- To remind me that all things end.
It is of endings that I wish to speak.
Sir, I address you as a kindred intellect.
Do you not recognise that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
History is replete with turning points.
You must have faith.
- Faith?
- The universe will unfold as it should.
- Is that logical?
Surely we must...
- Logic, logic, logic.
Logic is the beginning of wisdom, Val'eris.
Not the end.
This will be my final voyage on board this vessel as a member of her crew.
Nature abhors a vacuum.
I intend you to replace me.
I could only succeed you, sir.
Now hear this.
All offiicers to the bridge.
Klingon battle cruiser off the port bow.
All Officers to the bridge.
Captain on the bridge!
Shall we raise our shields, Captain?
I've never been this close.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
- Uhura, hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Right standard rudder.
Bring us alongside.
Right standard rudder.
Z plus 5 degrees.
Channel is open, Captain.
This is the Starship Enterprise.
Captain James T. Kirk commanding.
This is Kronos One.
I am Chancellor Gorkon.
We've been ordered to escort you to your meeting on Earth.
Thank you.
Would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard the Enterprise as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We would be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 19:30 hours.
I shall look forward to that.
I hope you're happy.
Captain!
There is a supply of Romulan ale aboard.
It might make the evening pass more... smoothly.
Officer thinking, Lieutenant.
Guess who's coming to dinner.
Energize.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- Captain Kirk.
May I present Captain Spock, whom I believe you know.
Captain, face to face at last.
You have my thanks.
Chancellor.
Gentlemen.
This is my daughter, Azetbur...
My military advisor, Brigadier Kerla...
General Chang, my chief of staff.
I have so wanted to meet you, Captain.
- I'm not sure how to take that.
- Sincere admiration, Kirk.
From one warrior to another.
Right...
This way.
You might enjoy a brief tour.
- They all look alike.
- What about that smell?
You know only top of the line models can even talk...
- You men have work?
- Yes, ma'am.
Then snap to it.
I offer a toast.
The undiscovered country.
- The future.
- The undiscovered country.
Hamlet, act 3, scene 1 .
You have not experienced Shake- speare until you've read him in Klingon.
Captain Kirk.
I thought Romulan ale was illegal.
An advantage of being 1,000 light years from Federation headquarters.
To you, Chancellor Gorkon.
One of the architects of our future.
Chancellor!
Perhaps we are looking at something of that future here.
Tell me, Captain Kirk.
Would you be willing to give up Starfleet?
The Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace.
I wouldn't dispute my first officer.
Starfleet has always been...
There's no need to mince words.
In space, all warriors are cold warriors.
General, are you fond of...
Shakespeare?
We believe all planets have a sovereign claim to inalienable human rights.
"Inalien..." If you could only hear yourselves.
"Human rights." Why, the very name is racist.
The Federation is a "homo sapiens only" club.
Present company excepted, of course.
We know where this is leading - the annihilation of our culture.
That's not true.
No!
"To be or not to be"...
That is the question which preoccupies our people.
- We need breathing room.
- Earth.
Hitler, 1938.
I beg your pardon.
Well...
I see we have a long way to go.
We must do this again sometime.
You don't trust me, do you?
I don't blame you.
If there is to be a brave new world, our generation is going to have the hardest time living in it.
- Captain Spock.
- Chancellor.
Madam.
Captain.
Well, most kind.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
Hmm, Captain?
"Have we not heard the chimes at midnight?"
Thank God!
- Did you see the way they ate?
- Terrible table manners.
I doubt our own behaviour will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy.
I'm going to sleep this off.
Is there any other way we can screw up tonight?
I'm going to go find a pot of black coffee.
The Enterprise hosted Chancellor Gorkon to dinner last night.
Our manners weren't exactly Emily Post.
To the galley
- Romulan ale no longer to be served at diplomatic functions.
Captain Kirk, will you please join me on the bridge?
Captain Kirk?
- Captain.
- What is it?
- I find this curious.
- Spock, I'm really tired.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
- Where?
- It appears to emanate from us.
The Enterprise?
Val'eris, do you know anything about a radiation surge?
Chekov?
Only the size of my head.
I know what you mean.
- What's happened?
- We've fired on the Chancellor's ship.
Torpedo room!
Please confirm, have we fired?
- Uhura, monitor.
- Aye, sir.
- Direct hit.
- Confirmed, sir.
We've lost gravity!
We are betrayed!
This is the bridge.
Do you read me?
- Did we fire those torpedoes?
- Negative.
We're still fully loaded.
Find Chang.
Unable to confirm or deny firing the torpedoes.
- Hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Kronos One, this is Enterprise.
Do you read?
It's very hard to make out.
There's been weapons firing and a lot of shouting.
- She's still listing.
- She's spinning out of control.
Restoring auxiliary gravity...
Have you not a shred of decency in you, Kirk?
We come in peace, and you blatantly defy that peace.
For that, I shall blow you out of the stars.
- We haven't fired.
- Captain...
According to our data banks, we have.
Twice...
Captain, they're coming about.
- They're preparing to fire.
- Shields up, Captain?
- Captain, our shields.
- Shields up, Captain?
Signal our surrender.
We surrender!
- This is Enterprise.
We surrender.
- If they fire, with our shields down...
- ...we will not be able to respond.
- Repeat, Enterprise surrenders.
- Are we firing torpedoes?
- I wish I knew.
- I'm going aboard.
Spock, take the con.
- I involved you, I will go.
No, I'll go.
We'll not be the instigators of war on the eve of universal peace.
I'm going too, they may need a doctor.
Uhura, tell them we're coming, and tell them we're unarmed.
- Have you lost your mind?
!
- I don't understand what's happened.
We're here to help.
Follow me.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- My God!
What has happened here?
- You dare to feign ignorance?
- What happened?
With a direct torpedo hit, you crippled our gravitational field and two of your Starfleet crew beamed aboard wearing magnetic boots.
- Aren't you carrying a surgeon?
- We were until this disgrace.
Then for god's sake, let me help.
I've got a pulse - we can move him.
I need light.
Put him on the table.
Hold him!
Hold him while I stabilize him.
I said hold him!
Sweet Jesus.
- Can you...?
- I don't even know his anatomy.
- His wounds are not closing.
- He's killing him!
He's gone into some kind of damned arrest.
Come on, dammit!
Come on!
He's not responding.
Don't let it end this way, Captain.
Under article 184 of your Interstellar Law I'm placing you under arrest.
You're charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
He tried to save him.
They've been arrested.
Mr Spock, we've got to do something.
I assume command of this ship as of 02:30 hours.
Commander Uhura, notify Starfleet headquarters and request instructions.
We cannot allow them to be taken to Kronos as prisoners.
Opening fire will not retrieve them, and we must avoid an armed conflict.
We will be able to follow the Captain's movements.
- How did you achieve this?
- Time is precious.
We must piece together what happened here tonight.
According to our data bank, this ship fired those torpedoes.
- No way!
- I sympathize, but we need evidence.
Please accompany me.
And if we cannot piece together what happened?
What then, sir?
In that case, Mr Chekov, it resides in the purview of the diplomats.
The Chancellor of the High Council is dead!
The result of an unprovoked attack while he travelled to see you under a flag of truce on a mission of peace!
Captain Kirk was legally arrested for the crime.
He and Dr. McCoy boarded Kronos One of their own free will.
- None of these facts are in dispute.
- I have ordered an investigation.
- In the meantime...
- In the meantime we expect the Federation to abide by the articles of Interstellar Law.
Kirk and Dr. McCoy will stand trial for the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon.
Out of the question.
Ambassador Sarek, can we get them extradited?
I share a measure of personal responsibility in this matter, but I am obliged to confirm my esteemed colleagues legal interpretation.
What is the position of the Romulan government?
I must concur with my colleagues.
You can't believe that Kirk assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council.
Mr President.
I don't know what to believe.
I'm waiting for your answer, sir.
This President is not above the law.
Mr President, Starfleet command is here from San Francisco.
- Mr President.
- Mr President.
Bill, Admiral Cartwright, please sit down.
Mr President, we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
I'm constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
Sir, would you please take a look at this.
We prepared Operation Retrieve based on the danger of terrorism between the Klingon empire and the Federation.
We can go in, rescue the hostages and get out in 24 hours with acceptable losses.
- We have the technology...
- Yes, yes.
But suppose you precipitate a full-scale war?
Then, quite frankly, we can clean their chronometers.
Mr President, they are vulnerable.
There will never be a better time.
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be.
I'll bear that in mind.
Thank you, gentlemen, that's all for now.
Mr President.
Sir...
Those men have literally saved this planet.
And now they're going to save it again.
By standing trial.
Report back on the double.
Do you read?
- We're to report back at once.
- We can't abandon Kirk and McCoy.
400 years ago, on Earth, workers who felt their livelyhood threatened flung their wooden shoes called "sabots" into the machines to stop them.
Hence the word "sabotage".
We experience technical malfunction.
All back-up systems inoperative.
Excellent.
I mean... too bad.
Mr President, I have been named chancellorin my father's place.
Madam Chancellor, you have my condolences on your loss.
I assure you that this shameful deed will not...
Let us come to the point.
You want this conference to go forward.
I will attend in one week, on one condition.
We will not extradite the prisoners, and you will not attempt to rescue them.
We would consider any such attempt an act of war.
We hope you'll be our guest here on Earth.
After recent events, you will understand if I prefer a neutral site.
And in the interest of security, let us keep the location secret for now.
As you wish, Madam Chancellor.
Attack them now, while we still can.
Attack or be slaves in their world.
We can take whole by force, what they propose to divide.
War is obsolete, General.
As we are in danger of becoming.
Better to die on our feet than live on our knees.
That wasn't what my father wanted.
Your father was killed for what he wanted.
The peace process will go forward.
Kirk...
Kirk will pay for my father's death.
It is as I said, Mr Spock.
Inventory registers every torpedo.
Yet the data banks insist we fired.
- One computer is lying.
- A computer doesn't lie!
Precisely.
Therefore we must inspect each torpedo visually.
That could take hours!
And if they're all there?
Then someone forged an entry in the data banks.
Gorkon's daughter has been named Chancellor.
It was on the news.
I'll bet that bitch killed her father.
- Her own father?
- It is an old story, sir.
They don't place the same value on life as we do, you know that.
Take my word, she did not shed one bloody tear.
Hardly conclusive, since Klingons have no tear-ducts.
Lieutenant, any response from Starfleet since our dispatch?
Yes, sir.
And?
Commander Uhura is experiencing technical difficulties, sir.
Curious.
Very well.
For 24 hours, we will agree this conversation didn't take place.
- A lie?
- An omission.
In 24 hours we won't have a clue where Captain Kirk is.
- I know precisely where he will be.
- You do?
Where?
Kirk, Kirk, Kirk, Kirk...
It's a damn show trial.
The Enterprise fired on Kronos One without provocation.
The Chancellor and his advisors having been lulled into a false sense of security by an invitation to a dinner aboard Captain Kirk's vessel at precisely 19:30 hours that same evening.
Call your first witness.
After the first shot we lost our gravitational field.
I was weightless and couldn't function.
Then two Starfleet crewmen came towards me.
Or perhaps they merely wore Starfleet uniforms.
That remark is speculative.
I move that it be stricken.
We're interested in facts, not theories.
If the gravitational unit was not functioning, how could they walk?
They appeared to be wearing magnetic boots.
- Gravity boots...?
- Dr. McCoy.
Would you be so good as to tell me what is your current medical status?
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
You have a singular wit, Doctor.
For 27 years I've been surgeon aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.
In three months I stand down.
You know...
I believe that you consumed rather a generous amount of Romulan ale in the officers mess on the night in question.
- Objection.
- Sustained.
We all did.
All of us.
That doesn't mean...
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
Barely.
Now be careful, Doctor.
Have you ever in your past saved patients as barely alive as he?
I didn't have the medical knowledge I needed for Klingon anatomy.
- I see.
- You where there.
You say you are due for retirement.
May I ask, do your hands shake?
- Objection!
- I was nervous.
No.
You were incompetent.
You were incompetent!
Whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink.
- The court will have to determine.
- My God, man.
I tried to save him!
I tried to save him.
I was desperate to save him.
He was the last best hope in the Universe for peace.
The witness is excused.
There we have it, citizens.
We have established the particulars of the crime.
And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair.
James Tiberius Kirk.
What would your favourite author say, Captain?
"Let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings."
Tell us your sad story, Kirk.
Tell us that you planned to take revenge for the death of your son.
- That's not true.
- Objection!
Captain Kirk has not been identified as the assassin.
I offer into the record this excerpt from the Captain's personal log.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I've never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Again!
Again!
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I've never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Are those your words?
Those words were spoken by me.
Objection!
My client's political views are not on trial.
On the contrary.
Captain Kirk's views are at the very heart of the matter.
His record shows him to be an insubordinate, unprincipled opportunist with a history of violating the chain of command whenever it suited him.
Continue.
The record shows that Captain Kirk once held the rank of Admiral and he was broken for taking matters into his own hands.
Do you deny being demoted for these charges.
Answer me now!
- I cannot deny it.
- You were demoted?
- For insubordination?
- On occasion, I have disobeyed orders.
Were you obeying or disobeying orders when you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?
I didn't know about it until we boarded the ship.
You still deny the Enterprise fired on Kronos One?
And you still deny your men beamed aboard and shot the Chancellor?
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I didn't witness.
Are you aware that as the captain of a ship, you are responsible for the actions of your men?
I am.
If it's proved that members of your crew carried out the assassination...
- They're setting us up.
Your Honours!
- Do not answer.
Captain Kirk, you will answer the question.
As Captain I'm responsible for the crew under my command.
Your Honours, the state rests.
Send to Commander Enterprise.
"We stand ready to assist you.
Captain Sulu, U.S.S. Excelsior."
It is the determination of this court that the prisoners are guilty as charged.
I wish to note for the record that all the evidence is circumstantial.
I beg the court to consider this when pronouncing its sentence.
So noted.
Captain James T. Kirk, Dr. Leonard McCoy.
In the interest of fostering amity for the forthcoming peace talks, the sentence of death is commuted.
It is the judgement of this court that, without possibility of reprieve or parole, you be taken from this place to the dilithium mines on the penal asteroid of Rura Penthe.
There to spend the rest of your natural lives.
Rura Penthe!
Known throughout the galaxy as the alien's graveyard.
Better to kill them now and get it over with.
Lieutenant.
The torpedo hit once again, please.
Hold.
It is Enterprise.
We fired.
That is not possible!
All weapons visually accounted for, sir.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains must be the truth.
What does that mean?
That if we cannot have fired those torpedoes, someone else did.
They didn't fire on themselves and there are no other ships present.
- There was a neutron surge.
- Not from us.
A neutron surge that big could only be produced by another ship.
- Kronos One?
- Too far away.
Very near us.
Possibly beneath us.
If there were a ship beneath us, the Klingons would have seen it.
Would they?
- A Bird of Prey?
- A Bird of Prey.
- Cloaked?
- They can't fired when they're cloaked.
All things being equal, I would agree.
However, things are not equal.
This one can.
- We must inform Starfleet Command.
- Of what?
A new weapon that's invisible?
They'll call us raving lunatics.
They'll say we'll say anything to exonerate the Captain.
And they would be correct.
We have no evidence.
Only a theory which happens to fit the facts.
Assuming you're right.
Why would they fire on their own President?
Indeed.
This ship will be searched from bow to stern.
I do not understand.
If there was a ship underneath us surely the assassins beamed aboard from that vessel, not Enterprise.
You're forgetting something, Mr Chekov.
According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
If we did, the killers are here.
If we did not, whoever altered the data banks is here.
In either case, what we are looking for is here.
- What are we looking for, sir?
- Lieutenant.
Two pairs of gravity boots.
This is the gulag Rura Penthe.
There is no stockades, no guard tower, no electronic frontier.
Only a magnetic shield prevents beaming.
Punishment means exile from prison to the surface.
On the surface, nothing can survive.
Work well, and you will be treated well.
Work badly...
Oh, my God!
The universal translator has been confiscated.
I'm sorry...?
He's definitely on about something, Jim.
If this is your spot, we'll move on.
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
- He's got it.
- And your coat.
I'm afraid not.
It wouldn't fit.
- Thanks.
- This will help keep you warm.
- I'm Martia.
You're Kirk and McCoy.
- How did you know that?
We don't get many presidential assassins.
- We didn't kill Gorkon.
- Of course not.
- But there's a reward for your death.
- That figures.
We've been set up.
Somebody up there wants you out of the way.
- Any progress?
- None.
A crew of 300 are looking everywhere, but the killers may still be among them.
Surely they have disposed of these boots by now.
Would it not have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
Logic must give way to physics.
Gravity wasn't restored when they escaped.
Without the boots, they would have floated off the transporter pads.
Why not simply vaporize them?
Like this?
As you know, no one can fire an unauthorized phaser aboard a starship.
Suppose, when they returned, they threw the boots into the refuse.
I'm having the refuse searched.
If I'm correct, those boots will cling to the killer's necks like Tiberian bats.
They couldn't escape without them nor throw them out the window.
Those boots are here.
Somewhere.
- Did someone fire off a phaser?
- It's alright.
It's nothing.
Mr Spock, Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
- Who fired the...
- Ah, Mr Scott.
I hear you have difficulty with the warp drive.
How long do you need for repair?
There's nothing wrong with the bloody thing.
If we return to space dock, the killers can dispose of their footwear and we will never see the Captain or Dr. McCoy alive again.
- It could take weeks.
- Thank you.
Val'eris, inform Starfleet our warp drive is inoperative.
- A lie?
- An error.
We have lost all contact with the Captain and Dr. McCoy.
Yes, at the moment they're surrounded by a magnetic shield.
But if I know the Captain, he is deep into planning his escape.
You've got him where you want him, Jim!
- Are you alright?
- I think so.
- They'll respect you now.
- I was lucky that thing had knees.
That was not his knee.
Not everybody keep their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Anything you want to tell me?
See what you can do for him.
Let him know we're not holding a grudge.
Suppose he's holding a grudge?
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
- Do you want to get out of here?
- There's got to be a way.
Three months before retirement.
What a way to finish.
- We're not finished.
- Speak for yourself.
One day, one night...
Kobayashi Maru!
Bones!
Are you afraid of the future?
I believe that was the general idea that I was trying to convey.
- I don't mean this future.
- What is this - multiple choice?
Some people are afraid...
of what might happen.
- I was terrified.
- What terrified you, specifically?
No more neutral zone.
I was used to hating Klingons.
It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his words.
- Spock was right.
- We all felt exactly the same.
No.
Somebody felt a lot worse.
I'm beginning to understand why.
If you've got any bright ideas, now is the time.
Time is the problem.
You and I are nothing.
You heard the judge - the peace conference is on again.
Whoever killed Gorkon is bound to attempt another assassination.
Unless we can get out of here.
It's me
- Martia.
Listen.
No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
- Except us.
- It is possible.
I know how to get outside the shield.
- How do we fit in?
- Getting outside the shield is easy.
After that, you have to get us off the surface before we freeze.
Can you?
- It's possible.
- I can't make it alone.
You're the likeliest candidate to come here for months.
Candidate for what?
Go to lift 7 in the morning for mining duty.
I'll see you there.
Don't disappoint me.
- What is it with you, anyway?
- Still think we're finished?
More than ever.
Sorry to wake you, sir.
Starfleet requests any data we have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
What?
They're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to space dock, sir.
Signal Starfleet that we have no idea location Enterprise.
- Sir?
- You have hearing problems?
No, sir.
Klingon blood.
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
This is the first evidence which corroborates our theory.
Now we go to Starfleet?
We expand our search to include uniforms.
All uniforms?
Clear, sir.
Make a hole.
Coming through.
Coming through.
Sir!
Sir!
- I think we've been had.
- No, you weren't, Doctor.
Get off at the first level.
Follow the gang into the mine.
They don't take girls.
- You are crewman Dax?
- Yes.
What is the problem?
Perhaps you know Russian epic of Cinderella?
If shoe fits - wear it.
Mr Chekov...
Watch me.
What kind of creature is this?
Last night you two were...
Get in.
Come on.
We don't have a lot of time.
Hurry!
Up there.
Come on - climb!
Here, you'll need these.
Quickly!
Stay close.
- There they are.
- They emerge from the beaming shield.
Mr Scott, start your engines.
Mr Chekov, set course for Rura Penthe.
Mr Spock, Rura Penthe is deep inside the Klingon frontier.
- If we're discovered...
- Correct.
We need a feat of linguistic legerdemain and intrepidity before the Captain and Dr. McCoy freeze to death.
- Leave me, I'm finished.
- No!
Bones, I'm wearing a viridium patch on my back.
Spock slapped it there before we went on Gorkon's ship.
That cunning little Vulcan.
Come on!
We're in the clear.
Now that we're outside the shield, they can locate us two sectors away.
If they're even looking for us.
This is listening post Morska.
What ship is that, over?
We must respond.
A universal translator would be recognised.
We am thy freighter...
Ursva.
Six weeks out of Kronos.
"What is your destination, over? "
We is condemning food things and supplies.
Don't catch any bugs.
Would you mind explaining that little trick you do?
- I'm a Chameloid.
- I've heard about you.
Shape-shifters.
I thought you were mythical.
Give a girl a chance, Captain.
It takes a lot of effort.
I don't doubt it.
Stop me if I'm wrong, but do we have any way of knowing whether this is the real you?
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.
We're outside the shield.
Now it's your turn, Captain.
If you say so.
Are you crazy?
!
She didn't need our help.
Where did you get these convenient clothes?
Don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue.
It's to let them know where we are.
Ask her what she's getting in return.
A full pardon... which doesn't cover this.
An accident wasn't good enough.
Come on, Spock.
Good enough for one.
Two would have looked suspicious.
Killed while attempting escape.
That's convincing for both.
Surprise!
- Your friends are late.
- They'll be along.
- I can't believe I kissed you.
- Must have been your lifelong ambition.
Isn't it time you became something else?
I like it here.
Well, well, well...
What took you so long?
Kill him, he's the one.
Not me, you idiot - him!
- No witnesses.
- Killed while trying to escape.
- Damned clever, if you ask me.
- It's a classic.
- That's what he wanted.
- Who?
Who wanted us killed?
Since you're all going to die anyway, why not tell you?
His name is...
Damn it!
What the hell!
Son of a...!
Couldn't you have waited two seconds?
He was about to explain the whole thing.
- You want to go back?
- Absolutely not!
This is the bridge.
We're still in Klingon space.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
They were beamed aboard a Federation Starship.
I could trace...
Escaped.
Kirk cannot know the location of the peace conference.
Are you sure?
Will you take that chance?
Helmsman, make course to intercept Enterprise.
The Klingons have a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked.
- She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
- So that's it.
We believe that Gorkon's murderers are aboard this ship.
- Has the peace conference begun?
- Who knows?
The location is secret.
- There's always something.
- Captain!
Mr Spock!
I found the uniforms with the Klingon blood on them.
But the uniforms belong to these two men.
Burke and Samno.
Not anymore.
Phaser on "stun" at close range.
First rule of assassination - kill the assassins.
- Now we're back to square one.
- Can I talk to you?
- Why weren't they vaporized?
- It would set off the alarm.
It's possible.
Now hear this.
Now hear this.
Court reporter to sick bay.
Code blue - urgent.
Statements to be taken at once from Yeomen Burke and Samno.
Repeat, court reporter to sick bay.
Code blue - urgent.
Statements to be taken.
Repeat, statements to be taken from Yeomen Burke and Samno.
You have to shoot.
If you are logical, you have to shoot.
- I do not want to.
- What you want is irrelevant.
What you've chosen is at hand.
I'd just as soon you didn't.
The operation is over.
I did not fire.
You cannot prove anything.
Yes, I can.
At my trial my personal log was used against me.
How long did you wait outside my quarters before I noticed you?
You knew?
I tried to tell you, but you would not listen.
Neither of us was hearing very well that night.
There were things I tried to tell you, about having faith.
You have betrayed the Federation.
All of you.
- And what have you've been doing?
- Saving Starfleet.
Klingons cannot be trusted.
Sir...
You said so yourself.
They killed your son.
Did you not wish Gorkon dead?
"Let them die", you said.
Did I misinterpret you?
And you were right.
They conspired with us to assassinate their own Chancellor.
How trustworthy can they be?
Klingons and Federation members conspiring together.
- Who is "us"?
- All who stands to lose from peace.
Names, Lieutenant.
My comrades will make certain all your transmissions are jammed.
- Names, Lieutenant!
- I do not remember.
A lie?
A choice.
Spock.
Admiral Cartwright.
From Starfleet?
Who else?
General...
Chang.
- Who else?
- Romulan Ambassador and others.
Where is the peace conference?
Where is the peace conference?
She does not know.
Then we're dead.
I have been dead before.
Contact Excelsior.
- She'll have the co-ordinates.
- I've already got it, sir.
- Standing by, Captain Kirk.
- Sulu.
You realize that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations.
I'm sorry, Captain.
Yourmessage is breaking up.
Bless you, Sulu.
Where is the peace conference?
They'll attempt another assassination.
It's at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border.
I'm sending the co-ordinates on a coded frequency.
We'll need more than that.
There's a Bird of Prey on the look-out for us that can fire when cloaked.
Surely not.
How many of those things are there?
Come on, Lieutenant.
- Just the prototype.
- Do you hear that?
I'm getting under way now.
We're in Alpha Quadrant.
The chances of our reaching the conference in time are slim.
- When does this conference start?
- According to my information - today.
- Thank you, Captain Sulu.
- Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
Spock?
I prefer it dark.
- Dining on ashes?
- You were right.
It was arrogant presumption on my part that got us into this situation.
You and the Doctor might have been killed.
The night is young.
You said it yourself, it was logical.
Peace is worth a few personal risks.
You're a great one for logic.
I'm a great one for rushing in where angels fear to tread.
We're both extremists.
Reality is probably somewhere in between.
I couldn't get past the death of my son.
I was prejudiced by her accomplishments as a Vulcan.
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was.
Is it possible that we two, you and I, have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?
Would that constitute a joke?
- It wasn't your fault.
- I was responsible.
- For no actions but your own.
- That's not what you said at your trial.
That was as captain of the ship.
Human beings...
We both know that I am not human.
Do you want to know something?
Everybody's human.
I find that remark... insulting.
Come, I need you.
Madam Chancellor, members of the diplomatic corps honoured guests.
The United Federation of Planets welcomes you to Camp Khitomer.
She's out here somewhere.
- But if she's cloaked...
- Then all we have is a radiation surge.
By the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes.
2.06... 2.03...
- Close enough to beam down?
- Not yet.
In two minutes. 1 .58.
Go to impulse power for Khitomer.
Let us redefine progress to mean that just because we can do a thing it does not necessarily follow that we must do that thing.
- Uhura?
- Nothing, Captain.
If she's here, she's rigged for silent running.
Coming up on transporter range in 57 seconds.
Transporter room.
Stand by to beam down.
53... 48 seconds.
44...
I can see you, Kirk.
Chang.
Can you see me?
Now be honest, Captain.
Warrior to warrior.
You do prefer it this way, don't you?
As it was meant to be.
No peace in our time.
"Once more unto the breach, dearfriends. "
- This is fun.
- Reverse engines.
All astern.
One and a half impulse power.
Back off!
What's she doing?
What's she waiting for?
Probably attempting to ascertain why we are reversing.
Wondering whether we detect her.
Incoming!
- In range?
- Not yet, sir.
Come on!
- She'll fly apart.
- Fly her apart, then!
Many speculated about my father's motives.
Some said he was an idealist.
Others said he had no choice.
If Praxis had not exploded, his idealism wouldn't have found expression.
We are a proud race.
We are here because we intend to go on being proud.
- Go to auxiliary power!
- Auxiliary circuits destroyed.
"Tickle us, do we not laugh?
Prick us, do we not bleed?"
"Wrong us, shall we not revenge?"
Gas.
Gas, Captain.
Under impulse power she expands fuel, like all vessels.
We call it "plasma", but it is merely ionised gas.
What about our equipment to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
The thing's got to have a tail-pipe.
Doctor, would you assist me in performing surgery on a torpedo?
Fascinating.
Hard to starboard.
The proposed agenda is as follows:
The evacuation of Kronos has been calculated within the 50 Earth year time span.
Phase 1 - preparation for evacuation...
Captain, she's packing quite a wallop.
Shields weakening.
Shields up!
Alright, now we're giving them something else to shoot at.
The game's afoot.
- Excelsior's been hit!
- "Our revels now are ended", Kirk.
"Cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war."
- Bones, where's my torpedo?
- Bet you wished you'd stayed in bed.
Shields collapsing!
The key, please.
Time is short.
- The hull has been compromised.
- I wonder how bad.
Connect echo-bars.
...discuss the report on phase 2.
- Alter circuit A.
- Sensor.
...we commence within minutes of the preparation.
- "I am constant as the Northern star."
- I'd give real money, if he'd shut up.
Plate, please.
...and assimilation will consume...
We've got a heart beat.
...with the Klingon Empire...
Key, please.
- Where's that torpedo?
- She's ready.
Lock and load!
Fire!
"To be... or not" "to be."
Target that explosion and fire.
Fire!
This work will occupy us throughout most of the week.
I hope that the delegation can implement the provisions of Phase 1 by the first of next month.
As you know, time is of the essence.
Out of the way!
Mr President!
Mr President!
Kirk, Enterprise.
Protect the Chancellor!
- Arrest those men!
- Arrest yourself!
We've got a full confession.
- This is not Klingon blood.
- Cartwright.
Just a minute.
It's Colonel West!
What's happened?
What's the mean of all of this?
It's about the future, Madam Chancellor.
Some people think the future means the end of history.
We haven't run out of history quite yet.
Your father called the future "the undiscovered country".
People can be very frightened of change.
You've restored my father's faith.
And you've restored my son's.
Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
And they're not going to prosecute.
They could have prosecuted me.
I felt like Val'eris.
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
And it's a good thing, too.
If they did, we'd all have to turn ourselves in.
- Captain Kirk.
- Captain Sulu.
As much to the crew of the Enterprise, I owe you my thanks.
Nice to see you in action one more time, Captain Kirk.
Take care.
- My God, that's a big ship.
- Not so big as her captain.
So...
This is goodbye?
It's about time we got underway ourselves.
Captain, I have orders from Starfleet Command.
We're to put back to space dock immediately... to be decommissioned.
If I were human, I believe my response would be:
"Go to hell."
If I were human.
Course heading, Captain?
Second star to the right.
And straight on 'til morning.
Captain's log, stardate 9529. 1.
This is the final cruise of the Starship Enterprise under my command.
This ship, and her history will shortly become the care of another crew.
To them and their posterity will we commit our future.
They'll continue the voyages we have begun and journey to all the undiscovered countries boldly going where no man, where no one has gone before.
Stardate 952 1.6.

Hikaru Sulu commanding.
After three years l`ve concluded my first assignment as master of this vessel, cataloguing gaseous planetary anomalies in Beta Quadrant.
We`re heading home under full impulse power.
Ship and crew have functioned well.
According to this, we`ve completed our survey of the entire sector.
Readout, we`re underpowered...

lt`s Praxis, sir.
lt`s a Klingon moon.
Praxis is their key energy-production facility.
Send to Klingon High Command.
"This is Excelsior, a Federation starship.
"We have monitored a large explosion in your sector.
- "Do you require assistance?"
- Aye, sir.
- Mr Vultane, any more data?
- l`ve confirmed Praxis` location, but...
- l cannot confirm Praxis` existence.
- On screen.
- Magnify.
- Computer enhancement.
- Praxis?
- What`s left of it, sir.
l`m getting a message from Praxis.
Let`s have it.
This is Brigadier Kerla, speaking for the High Command.
There has been an incident on Praxis.
However, everything is under control.
We have no need for assistance.
Obey treaty stipulations and remain outside the Neutral Zone.
This transmission ends now.
- An incident?
- Do we report this, sir?
Are you kidding?
- What are we doing here?
- Maybe it`s a retirement party.
That suits me. I just bought a boat.
l`m supposed to be chairing a seminar at the Academy.
- lsn`t this just for top brass?
- Where is Sulu?
Captain Sulu.
On assignment.
Where`s Spock?
This briefing is classified.
Ladies and gentlemen, the C-in-C.
As you were.
l`ll break this information down succinctly.
The Klingon Empire has 50 years of life left.
For full details, l`m turning this briefing over to the Federation Special Envoy.
Good morning.
Two months ago a Federation starship monitored an explosion on Praxis.
We believe it was caused by over-mining and insufficient safety precautions.
The moon`s decimation means the deadly pollution of their ozone.
They will have depleted their oxygen supply in 50 Earth years.
Due to their enormous military budget the Klingon economy doesn`t have the resources to combat this catastrophe.
Last month, at the behest of the Vulcan ambassador, I opened a dialogue with Gorkon, Chancellor of the Klingon High Council.
He proposes to commence negotiations at once.
Negotiations for what?
The dismantling of our space stations and bases along the Neutral Zone.
An end to 70 years of hostility, which the Klingons can no longer afford.
Bill, are we talking about mothballing the Starfleet?
Our exploration and scientific programmes would be unaffected, but... I must protest!
To offer Klingons safe haven within Federation space is suicide.
Klingons would become the alien trash of the galaxy.
If we dismantle the fleet, we`d be defenceless before an aggressive species on our territory.
The opportunity here is to bring them to their knees.
Then we`ll be in a better position to dictate terms.
- Sir...
- Captain Kirk?
The Klingons have never been trustworthy.
I agree with Admiral Cartwright.
This is a terrifying idea.
It is imperative that we act now to support the Gorkon initiative, lest more conservative elements persuade his empire that it`s better to attempt a military solution and die fighting.
You, Captain Kirk, are to be our first olive branch.
We are to rendezvous with the vessel which is bringing Gorkon to Earth and to escort him safely through Federation space.
Me?
There are Klingons who feel the same about the peace treaty as yourself, but they`ll think twice about attacking the Enterprise under your command.
I have personally vouched for you in this matter.
You have personally vouched...?
You will extend Chancellor Gorkon full diplomatic courtesy, Captain.
- A full ambassador is better equipped...
- lf there`s no further business I wish you and your crew Godspeed.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
I remind you this meeting is classified.
I don`t know whether to congratulate you or not, Jim.
I wouldn`t.
We volunteered?
There`s an old Vulcan proverb:
"Only Nixon could go to China."
How could you vouch for me?
- That`s arrogant presumption.
- My father requested that I open... I know your father is the Vulcan ambassador, but you know how I feel.
- They`re animals.
- Jim...
- There is an historic opportunity here.
- Don`t believe them!
Don`t trust them!
- They`re dying.
- Let them die.
Has it occurred to you that this crew is due to stand down in three months?
We`ve done our bit for king and country.
You should have trusted me.
Control, this is S-D 1 03, approach to space dock.
Over.
You are clear to deliver Captain Kirk and party to NCC- 1 70 1 Alpha.
- Captain on the bridge!
- As you were.
Lieutenant...?
Valeris, sir.
We were told you needed a helmsman, so I volunteered.
It is agreeable to see you again.
She was the first Vulcan to graduate at the top of her class at the Academy.
- You must be very proud.
- l don`t believe so, sir.
She`s a Vulcan, all right.
Let`s get this over with.
Departure stations.
- Scotty?
Did you find the engine room?
- Right where l left it.
- Stand by.
Uhura, get the dock master.
- Control tower reading, sir.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
This is Control.
Permission to depart granted. 30 seconds for port gates.
- Clear all moorings.
- Awaiting port gates from this mark.
- All lines clear.
- Aft thrusters.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
1 quarter impulse power.
Captain, regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock.
Jim...
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
Aye, sir.
Captain`s log.
Stardate 9522.6.
l`ve never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I can never forgive them for the death of my boy.
To escort the Chancellor of the Klingon High Council to a peace summit is problematic, at best.
Spock says this could be an historic occasion. l`d like to believe him.
But how on earth can history get past people like me?
- Sorry.
- You could have knocked.
We are almost at the rendezvous, sir.
I thought that you would like to know.
Permission to speak freely, sir.
It is an honour to serve with you.
You piloted well out of space dock, Lieutenant.
l`ve always wanted to try that.
You`ve done well, Valeris.
As your sponsor at the Academy l`ve followed your career with satisfaction.
And as a Vulcan, you have exceeded my expectations.
I do not understand this representation.
lt`s a depiction from ancient Earth mythology.
The Expulsion from Paradise.
- Why keep it in your quarters?
- To remind me that all things end.
It is of endings that I wish to speak.
Sir, I address you as a kindred intellect.
Do you not recognise that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
History is replete with turning points.
You must have faith.
- Faith?
- The universe will unfold as it should.
- ls that logical?
Surely we must...
- Logic, logic, logic.
Logic is the beginning of wisdom, Valeris.
Not the end.
This will be my final voyage on board this vessel as a member of her crew.
Nature abhors a vacuum.
I intend you to replace me.
I could only succeed you, sir.
Now hear this.
Officers to the bridge.
Klingon battle cruiser off the port bow.
All officers to the bridge.
Captain on the bridge!
Shall we raise our shields, Captain?
l`ve never been this close.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
- Uhura, hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Right standard rudder.
Put us alongside.
Right standard rudder.
Z plus 5 degrees.
Channel is open, Captain.
This is the Starship Enterprise.
Captain James T Kirk commanding.
This is Kronos One.
I am Chancellor Gorkon.
We`ve been ordered to escort you to your meeting on Earth.
Thank you.
Would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard the Enterprise as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We would be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
We`ll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1 9:30 hours.
I shall look forward to that.
I hope you`re happy.
Captain!
There is a supply of Romulan ale aboard.
It might make the evening pass more...smoothly.
Officer thinking, Lieutenant.
Guess who`s coming to dinner.
Energise.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- Captain Kirk.
Captain Spock, whom you know.
Captain, face to face at last.
You have my thanks.
Chancellor.
Gentlemen.
This is my daughter Azetbur.
My military advisor Brigadier Kerla and this is General Chang, my chief of staff.
I have so wanted to meet you, Captain.
- l`m not sure how to take that.
- Sincere admiration, Kirk.
From one warrior to another.
Right...
This way.
You might enjoy a brief tour.
- They all look alike.
- What about that smell?
You know only top-of-the-line models can even talk...
- You men have work?
- Yes, ma`am.
Then snap to it.
I offer a toast.
"The undiscovered country."
- The future.
- "The undiscovered country."
Hamlet, Act 3, Scene 1 .
You don`t know Shakespeare until you`ve read him in the original Klingon.
Captain Kirk, I thought Romulan ale was illegal.
An advantage of being 1 ,000 light years from Federation headquarters.
To you, Chancellor Gorkon.
One of the architects of our future.
Chancellor!
Perhaps we are looking at something of that future here.
Tell me, Captain Kirk, would you be willing to give up Starfleet?
The Captain feels that Starfleet`s mission has always been one of peace.
I wouldn`t dispute my first officer.
Starfleet has always been...
There`s no need to mince words.
In space, all warriors are cold warriors.
General, are you fond of...
Shakespeare?
We believe all planets have a sovereign claim to inalienable human rights.
"lnalien..." lf you could only hear yourselves.
"Human rights." Why, the very name is racist.
The Federation is a "Homo sapiens only" club.
Present company excepted, of course.
We know where this is leading:
the annihilation of our culture.
- That`s not true.
- No?
No!
"To be or not to be..." That is the question which preoccupies our people.
- We need breathing room.
- Earth.
Hitler, 1 938.
I beg your pardon.
Well... I see we have a long way to go.
We must do this again sometime.
You don`t trust me, do you?
I don`t blame you.
If there is to be a brave new world, our generation is going to have the hardest time living in it.
- Captain Spock.
- Chancellor.
Madam.
Captain.
Well, most kind.
"Parting is such sweet sorrow." Hmm, Captain?
Have we not heard "the chimes at midnight"?
Thank God!
- Did you see the way they ate?
- Terrible table manners.
I doubt our own behaviour will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy.
l`m going to sleep this off. ls there any other way we can screw up tonight?
l`m going to go find a pot of black coffee.
The Enterprise hosted Chancellor Gorkon to dinner last night.
Our manners weren`t exactly Emily Post.
To the galley:
Romulan ale no longer to be served at diplomatic functions.
Captain Kirk, will you please join me on the bridge?
Captain Kirk?
- Captain.
- What is it?
- l find this curious.
- Spock, l`m really tired.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
- Where?
- lt appears to emanate from us.
The Enterprise?
Valeris, do you know anything about a radiation surge?
Chekov?
Only the size of my head.
I know what you mean.
- What`s happened?
- We`ve fired on the Chancellor`s ship.
Torpedo room!
Please confirm, have we fired?
- Uhura, monitor.
- Aye, sir.
- Direct hit.
- Confirmed, sir.
This is the bridge.
Do you read me?
- Did we fire those torpedoes?
- Negative.
We`re still fully loaded.
Unable to confirm or deny firing the torpedoes.
- Hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Kronos One, this is Enterprise.
Do you read?
Over.
lt`s very hard to make out.
There`s been weapons firing and a lot of shouting.
- She`s still listing.
- She`s spinning out of control.
Have you not a shred of decency in you, Kirk?
We come in peace, and you blatantly defy that peace.
For that, I shall blow you out of the stars.
- We haven`t fired.
- Captain...
According to our data banks, we have.
Twice.
Captain, they`re coming about.
- They`re preparing to fire.
- Shields up, Captain?
- Captain, our shields.
- Shields up, Captain?
- Signal our surrender.
- Captain?
We surrender!
- This is Enterprise.
We surrender.
- lf they fire, with our shields down...
- ...we will not be able to respond.
- Repeat, Enterprise surrenders.
- Are we firing torpedoes?
- l wish I knew.
- l`m going aboard.
Spock, take the conn.
- l involved you, I will go.
No, l`ll go.
We`ll not be the instigators of war on the eve of universal peace.
- l`ll go, too, they may need a doctor.
- Perhaps you`re right.
Uhura, tell them we`re coming, and tell them we`re unarmed.
- Have you lost your mind?
!
- l don`t understand what`s happened.
We`re here to help.
Follow me.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- My God!
What has happened here?
- You dare to feign ignorance?
- What happened?
With a direct torpedo hit, you crippled our gravitational field and two of your Starfleet crew beamed aboard wearing magnetic boots.
- Aren`t you carrying a surgeon?
- We were until this disgrace.
Then for God`s sake, let me help.
l`ve got a pulse.
We can move him.
I need light.
Put him on the table.
Hold him!
Hold him while I stabilise him.
I said hold him!
Sweet Jesus.
- Can you...?
- l don`t even know his anatomy.
- His wounds are not closing.
- He`s killing him!
He`s gone into some kind of damned arrest.
Come on, dammit!
Come on!
He`s not responding.
Don`t let it end this way, Captain.
Under article 1 84 of your interstellar Law l`m placing you under arrest.
You`re charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
He tried to save him.
They`ve been arrested.
Mr Spock, we`ve got to do something.
I assume command of this ship as of 02:30 hours.
Commander Uhura, notify Starfleet headquarters and request instructions.
We cannot allow them to be taken to Kronos as prisoners.
What do you suggest?
Opening fire won`t retrieve them, and we must avoid an armed conflict.
We`ll be able to follow the Captain.
- How did you achieve this?
- Time is precious.
We must piece together what happened here tonight.
According to our data bank, this ship fired those torpedoes.
- No way!
- l sympathise, but we need evidence.
Please accompany me.
And if we cannot piece together what happened?
What then, sir?
In that case, Mr Chekov, it resides in the purview of the diplomats.
The Chancellor of the High Council is dead!
The result of an unprovoked attack while he travelled to see you under a flag of truce on a mission of peace!
Captain Kirk was legally arrested for the crime.
He and Dr McCoy boarded Kronos One of their own free will.
- None of these facts are in dispute.
- l have ordered an investigation.
- ln the meantime...
- ln the meantime we expect the Federation to abide by the articles of interstellar Law.
Kirk and Dr McCoy will stand trial for the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon.
Out of the question.
Ambassador Sarek, can we get them extradited?
Mr President, I share a measure of personal responsibility in this matter, but I am obliged to confirm my esteemed colleague`s legal interpretation.
What is the position of the Romulan government?
I must concur with my colleagues.
You can`t believe that Kirk assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council.
Mr President, I don`t know what to believe.
l`m waiting for your answer, sir.
This President is not above the law.
Mr President, Starfleet Command is here from San Francisco.
- Mr President.
- Mr President.
Bill, Admiral Cartwright, please sit down.
Mr President, we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
l`m constrained to observe lnterstellar Law.
Sir, would you please take a look at this?
Colonel West.
We prepared Operation Retrieve based on the danger of terrorism between the Klingon Empire and the Federation.
We can go in, rescue the hostages and get out in 24 hours with acceptable losses.
- We have the technology...
- Yes, yes.
But suppose you precipitate a full-scale war?
Then, quite frankly, we can clean their chronometers.
Mr President, they are vulnerable.
There will never be a better time.
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be.
l`ll bear that in mind.
Thank you, gentlemen, that`s all for now.
Mr President.
Sir...
Those men have saved this planet.
I know that.
And now they`re going to save it again.
By standing trial.
Enterprise, report back on the double.
Do you read?
- We`re to report back at once.
- We can`t abandon Kirk and McCoy.
400 years ago, on Earth, workers who felt their livelihood threatened flung their wooden shoes called "sabots" into the machines to stop them.
Hence the word "sabotage".
We experience technical malfunction.
All back-up systems inoperative.
Excellent. I mean...too bad.
Mr President, I have been named chancellor in my father`s place.
Madam Chancellor, you have my condolences on your loss.
I assure you that this shameful deed will not...
Let us come to the point.
You want this conference to go forward.
I will attend in one week, on one condition.
We will not extradite the prisoners, and you will not attempt to rescue them.
We would consider any such attempt an act of war.
We hope you`ll be our guest here on Earth.
After recent events, you will understand if I prefer a neutral site.
And in the interest of security, let us keep the location secret for now.
As you wish, Madam Chancellor.
Your father was killed for what he wanted.
The peace process will go forward.
Kirk...
Kirk will pay for my father`s death.
It is as I said, Mr Spock.
Inventory registers every torpedo.
Yet the data banks insist we fired.
- One computer is lying.
- A computer doesn`t lie!
Precisely.
Therefore we must inspect each torpedo visually.
That could take hours!
And if they`re all there?
Then someone forged an entry in the data banks.
Gorkon`s daughter has been named Chancellor. it was on the news.
l`ll bet that bitch killed her father.
- Her own father?
- lt is an old story, sir.
They don`t place the same value on life as we do, you know that.
Take my word, she did not shed one bloody tear.
Hardly conclusive, since Klingons have no tear ducts.
Lieutenant, any response from Starfleet since our dispatch?
Yes, sir.
And?
Commander Uhura is experiencing technical difficulties, sir.
Curious.
Very well.
For 24 hours, we will agree this conversation didn`t take place.
- A lie?
- An omission.
In 24 hours we won`t have a clue where Captain Kirk is.
- l know precisely where he will be.
- You do?
Where?
Kirk, Kirk, Kirk, Kirk... lt`s a damn show trial.
The Enterprise fired on Kronos One without provocation.
The Chancellor and his advisors having been lulled into a false sense of security by an invitation to a dinner aboard Captain Kirk`s vessel at precisely 1 9:30 hours that same evening.
Call your first witness.
After the first shot we lost our gravitational field.
I was weightless and couldn`t function.
Then two Starfleet crewmen came towards me.
Or perhaps they merely wore Starfleet uniforms.
That remark is speculative.
I move that it be stricken.
We`re interested in facts, not theories.
If the gravitational unit was not functioning, how could they walk?
They appeared to be wearing magnetic boots.
- Gravity boots?
- Dr McCoy.
Would you be so good as to tell me what is your current medical status?
Aside from a touch of arthritis, l`d say pretty good.
You have a singular wit, Doctor.
For 27 years l`ve been surgeon aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.
In three months I stand down.
You know I believe that you consumed rather a generous amount of Romulan ale in the officers` mess on the night in question.
- Objection.
- Sustained.
We all did.
All of us.
That doesn`t mean...
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
Barely.
Be careful, Doctor.
Have you ever in your past saved patients as barely alive as he?
I didn`t have the medical knowledge I needed for Klingon anatomy.
- l see.
- You were there.
You say you are due for retirement.
May I ask, do your hands shake?
- Objection!
- l was nervous.
No.
You were incompetent.
You were incompetent!
Whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink.
- The court will have to determine.
- My God, man. I tried to save him!
I tried to save him.
I was desperate to save him.
He was the last best hope in the universe for peace.
The witness is excused.
There we have it, citizens.
We have established the particulars of the crime.
And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair.
James Tiberius Kirk.
What would your favourite author say, Captain?
"Let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings."
Tell us your sad story, Kirk.
Tell us that you planned to take revenge for the death of your son.
- That`s not true.
- Objection!
Captain Kirk has not been identified as the assassin.
Sustained.
I offer into the record this excerpt from the Captain`s personal log.
l`ve never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
l`ve never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
l`ve never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
l`ve never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Are those your words?
Those words were spoken by me.
Objection!
My client`s political views are not on trial.
On the contrary.
Captain Kirk`s views are at the very heart of the matter.
This officer`s record shows him to be an insubordinate, unprincipled opportunist with a history of violating the chain of command whenever it suited him.
Continue.
The record shows that Captain Kirk once held the rank of Admiral, and he was broken for taking matters into his own hands.
Do you deny being demoted for these charges?
Answer me now!
- l cannot deny it.
- You were demoted?
- For insubordination?
- On occasion, I have disobeyed orders.
Were you obeying or disobeying orders when you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?
I didn`t know about it until we boarded the ship.
You still deny the Enterprise fired on Kronos One?
Please!
You still deny your men shot the Chancellor?
Objection!
I cannot confirm or deny actions I did not witness.
Are you aware that as the captain of a ship, you are responsible for the actions of your men?
I am.
If it`s proved that members of your crew carried out the assassination...
- They`re setting us up.
Your Honours!
- Do not answer.
Captain Kirk, you will answer the question.
As Captain l`m responsible for the crew under my command.
Your Honours, the state rests.
Send to Commander Enterprise:
"We stand ready to assist you.
Captain Sulu, U.S.S. Excelsior."
It is the determination of this court that the prisoners are guilty as charged.
I wish to note for the record that all the evidence is circumstantial.
I beg the court to consider this when pronouncing its sentence.
So noted.
Captain James T Kirk, Dr Leonard McCoy, in the interest of fostering amity for the forthcoming peace talks, the sentence of death is commuted.
It is the judgement of this court that, without possibility of reprieve or parole, you be taken from this place to the dilithium mines on the penal asteroid of Rura Penthe.
There to spend the rest of your natural lives.
Rura Penthe!
Known throughout the galaxy as the aliens` graveyard.
Better to kill them now and get it over with.
Lieutenant.
The torpedo hit once again, please.
Hold.
It is Enterprise.
We fired.
That is not possible!
All weapons visually accounted for, sir.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains must be the truth.
What does that mean?
That if we cannot have fired those torpedoes, someone else did.
They didn`t fire on themselves and there are no other ships present.
- There was a neutron surge.
- Not from us.
A neutron surge that big could only be produced by another ship.
- Kronos One?
- Too far away.
Very near us.
Possibly beneath us.
If there were a ship beneath us, the Klingons would have seen her.
Would they?
- A bird-of-prey?
- A bird-of-prey.
- Cloaked?
- They can`t fire when they`re cloaked.
All things being equal, I would agree.
However, things are not equal.
This one can.
- We must inform Starfleet Command.
- Of what?
A new weapon that`s invisible?
They`ll call us raving lunatics.
They`ll say we`ll say anything to exonerate the Captain.
And they would be correct.
We have no evidence.
Only a theory, which happens to fit the facts.
Assuming you`re right, why would they fire on their own president?
Indeed.
This ship will be searched.
Lt. Valeris, you`ll be in charge.
- Aye, sir.
- l do not understand.
If there was a ship underneath us, surely the assassins beamed aboard from that vessel, not Enterprise.
You`re forgetting something, Mr Chekov.
According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
If we did, the killers are here.
If we did not, whoever altered the data banks is here.
In either case, what we are looking for is here.
- What are we looking for, sir?
- Lieutenant.
Two pairs of gravity boots.
This is the gulag Rura Penthe.
There is no stockade, no guard tower, no electronic frontier.
Only a magnetic shield prevents beaming.
Punishment means exile from prison to the surface.
On the surface, nothing can survive.
Work well, and you will be treated well.
Work badly, and you will die.
Oh, my God!
The universal translator has been confiscated.
l`m sorry...?
He`s definitely on about something, Jim.
If this is your spot, we`ll move on.
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
- He`s got it.
- And your coat.
l`m afraid not. lt wouldn`t fit.
- Thanks.
- This will help keep you warm.
- l`m Martia.
You`re Kirk and McCoy.
- How did you know that?
We don`t get many presidential assassins.
- We didn`t kill Gorkon.
- Of course not.
- But there`s a reward for your death.
- That figures.
We`ve been set up all along.
Somebody up there wants you out of the way.
- Any progress?
- None.
A crew of 300 are looking everywhere, but the killers may still be among them.
Surely they have disposed of these boots by now.
Would it not have been logical to leave them on Gorkon`s ship?
Logic must give way to physics.
Gravity wasn`t restored when they escaped.
Without the boots, they would have floated off the transporter pads.
Why not simply vaporise them?
Like this?
As you know, no one can fire an unauthorised phaser aboard a starship.
Suppose, when they returned, they threw the boots into the refuse.
l`m having the refuse searched.
If l`m correct, those boots will cling to the killer`s necks like Tiberian bats.
They couldn`t escape without them nor throw them out the window.
Those boots are here.
Somewhere.
- Did someone fire off a phaser?
- lt`s all right. lt`s nothing.
Mr Spock, Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
- Who fired the...
- Ah, Mr Scott.
I hear you have difficulty with the warp drive.
How long do you need for repair?
There`s nothing wrong with the bloody thing.
If we return to space dock, the killers can dispose of their footwear and we will never see the Captain or Dr McCoy alive again.
- lt could take weeks.
- Thank you.
Valeris, inform Starfleet our warp drive is inoperative.
- A lie?
- An error.
We have lost all contact with the Captain and Dr McCoy.
Yes, at the moment they`re surrounded by a magnetic shield.
But if I know the Captain, he is deep into planning his escape.
You`ve got him where you want him, Jim!
- Are you all right?
- l think so.
- They`ll respect you now.
- l was lucky that thing had knees.
That was not his knee.
Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Anything you want to tell me?
See what you can do for him.
Let him know we`re not holding a grudge.
Suppose he`s holding a grudge?
When whoever it is makes their move, you won`t be here to ask if he`s the one.
- Do you want to get out of here?
- There`s got to be a way.
Three months before retirement.
What a way to finish.
- We`re not finished.
- Speak for yourself.
One day, one night...
Kobayashi Maru!
Bones!
Are you afraid of the future?
I believe that was the general idea that I was trying to convey.
- l don`t mean this future.
- What is this?
Multiple choice?
Some people are afraid...
of what might happen.
- l was terrified.
- What terrified you, specifically?
No more Neutral Zone.
I was used to hating Klingons.
It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word.
- Spock was right.
- We all felt exactly the same.
No.
Somebody felt a lot worse.
l`m beginning to understand why.
If you`ve got any bright ideas, now is the time.
Time is the problem.
You and I are nothing.
You heard the judge.
The peace conference is on again.
Whoever killed Gorkon is bound to attempt another assassination.
Unless we can get out of here.
lt`s me, Martia.
Listen.
No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
- Except us.
- lt is possible.
I know how to get outside the shield.
- How do we fit in?
- Getting outside the shield is easy.
After that, you have to get us off the surface before we freeze.
Can you?
- lt`s possible.
- l can`t make it alone.
You`re the likeliest candidate to come here for months.
Candidate for what?
Go to lift 7 in the morning for mining duty. l`ll see you there.
Don`t disappoint me.
- What is it with you, anyway?
- Still think we`re finished?
More than ever.
Sorry to wake you, sir.
Starfleet requests any data we have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
What?
They`re refusing to acknowledge signal to return to space dock, sir.
Signal Starfleet that we have no idea location Enterprise.
- Sir?
- You have hearing problems?
No, sir.
Klingon blood.
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
This is the first evidence which corroborates our theory.
Now we go to Starfleet?
We expand our search to include uniforms.
All uniforms?
Clear, sir.
Make a hole.
Coming through.
Coming through.
Sir!
Sir!
- l think we`ve been had.
- No, you weren`t, Doctor.
Get off at the first level.
Follow the gang into the mine.
They don`t take girls.
- You are Crewman Dax?
- Yes.
What is the problem?
Perhaps you know Russian epic of Cinderella?
If shoe fits, wear it.
Mr Chekov...
Watch me.
What kind of creature is this?
Last night you two...
Don`t remind me.
Get in.
Come on.
We don`t have a lot of time.
Hurry!
Up there.
Come on, climb!
Here, you`ll need these.
Quickly!
Stay close.
- There they are.
- Emerging from the beaming shield.
Mr Scott, start your engines.
Mr Chekov, set course for Rura Penthe.
Mr Spock, Rura Penthe is deep inside the Klingon frontier.
- lf we`re discovered...
- Correct.
We need a feat of linguistic legerdemain and intrepidity before the captain and Dr McCoy freeze to death.
- Leave me, l`m finished.
- No!
Bones, l`m wearing a viridium patch on my back.
Spock slapped it there before we went on Gorkon`s ship.
That cunning little Vulcan.
Come on!
We`re in the clear.
Now that we`re outside the shield, they can locate us two sectors away.
If they`re even looking for us.
We must respond.
A universal translator would be recognised.
"What is your destination, over?"
Would you mind explaining that little trick you do?
- l`m a Chameloid.
- l`ve heard about you.
Shape-shifters.
I thought you were mythical.
Give a girl a chance, Captain.
It takes a lot of effort.
I don`t doubt it.
Stop me if l`m wrong, but do we have any way of knowing whether this is the real you?
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.
We`re outside the shield.
Now it`s your turn, Captain.
If you say so.
Are you crazy?
!
She didn`t need our help.
Where did you get these clothes?
Don`t tell me that flare is standard prison issue.
It leads them to us.
Ask her what she`s getting in return.
A full pardon...which doesn`t cover this.
An accident wasn`t good enough.
Come on, Spock.
Good enough for one.
Two would have looked suspicious.
Killed while attempting escape.
That`s convincing for both.
Surprise!
- Your friends are late.
- They`ll be along.
- l can`t believe I kissed you.
- Must have been your lifelong ambition.
lsn`t it time you became something else?
I like it here.
Well, well, well...
What took you so long?
Kill him, he`s the one.
Not me, you idiot, him!
- No witnesses.
- Killed while trying to escape.
- Damned clever, if you ask me.
- lt`s a classic.
- That`s what he wanted.
- Who?
Who wanted us killed?
Since you`re all going to die anyway, why not tell you?
His name is...
Damn it!
What the hell!
Couldn`t you have waited two seconds?
He was about to explain the whole thing.
- You want to go back?
- Absolutely not!
This is the bridge.
We`re still in Klingon space.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
The Klingons have a bird-of-prey that can fire while cloaked.
- She torpedoed Gorkon`s ship.
- So that`s it.
We believe that Gorkon`s murderers are aboard this ship.
- Has the peace conference begun?
- Who knows?
The location is secret.
- There`s always something.
- Captain!
Mr Spock!
I found the uniforms with the Klingon blood on them.
But the uniforms belong to these two men.
Burke and Samno.
Not anymore.
Phaser on "stun" at close range.
First rule of assassination.
Kill the assassins.
- Now we`re back to square one.
- Can I talk to you?
- Why weren`t they vaporised?
- lt would set off the alarm.
lt`s possible.
Now hear this.
Now hear this.
Court reporter to sick bay.
Code blue, urgent.
Statements to be taken at once from Yeomen Burke and Samno.
Repeat, court reporter to sick bay.
Code blue, urgent.
Statements to be taken.
Repeat, statements to be taken from Yeomen Burke and Samno.
You have to shoot.
If you are logical, you have to shoot.
- l do not want to.
- What you want is irrelevant.
What you`ve chosen is at hand.
l`d just as soon you didn`t.
The operation is over.
I did not fire.
You cannot prove anything.
Yes, I can.
At my trial my personal log was used against me.
How long did you wait outside my quarters before I noticed you?
You knew?
I tried to tell you, but you would not listen.
Neither of us was hearing very well that night.
There were things I tried to tell you, about having faith.
You have betrayed the Federation.
All of you.
- And what have you been doing?
- Saving Starfleet.
Klingons cannot be trusted.
Sir...
You said so yourself.
They killed your son.
Did you not wish Gorkon dead?
"Let them die", you said.
Did I misinterpret you?
And you were right.
They conspired with us to assassinate their own chancellor.
How trustworthy can they be?
Klingons and Federation members conspiring together.
- Who is "us"?
- All who stand to lose from peace.
Names, Lieutenant.
My comrades will make sure all your transmissions are jammed.
- Names, Lieutenant!
- l do not remember.
A lie.
A choice.
Spock.
Admiral Cartwright.
Who else?
General...
Chang.
- Who else?
- The Romulan ambassador.
Where is the peace conference?
Where is the peace conference?
She does not know.
Then we`re dead.
I have been dead before.
Contact Excelsior.
- She`ll have the coordinates.
- l`ve already got it, sir.
- Standing by, Captain Kirk.
- Sulu.
You realise that by even talking to us, you`re violating regulations.
l`m sorry, your message is breaking up.
Bless you.
Where is the conference?
They`ll attempt another assassination.
lt`s at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border.
l`m sending the coordinates on a coded frequency.
We`ll need more than that.
There`s a bird-of-prey on the lookout for us that can fire when cloaked.
Surely not.
How many of those things are there?
Come on, Lieutenant.
- Just the prototype.
- Do you hear that?
l`m getting under way now.
We`re in Alpha Quadrant.
The chances of our reaching the conference in time are slim.
- When does this conference start?
- According to my information, today.
- Thank you, Captain Sulu.
- Don`t mention it, Captain Kirk.
Spock?
I prefer it dark.
- Dining on ashes?
- You were right.
It was arrogant presumption on my part that got us into this situation.
You and the Doctor might have been killed.
The night is young.
You said it yourself, it was logical.
Peace is worth a few personal risks.
You`re a great one for logic.
l`m a great one for rushing in where angels fear to tread.
We`re both extremists.
Reality is probably somewhere in between.
I couldn`t get past the death of my son.
I was prejudiced by her accomplishments as a Vulcan.
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was.
is it possible that we two, you and I, have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?
Would that constitute a joke?
- lt wasn`t your fault.
- l was responsible.
- For no actions but your own.
- That`s not what you said at your trial.
That was as captain of the ship.
Human beings...
We both know that I am not human.
Do you want to know something?
Everybody`s human.
- l find that remark...insulting.
- Come, I need you.
Madam Chancellor, members of the diplomatic corps honoured guests.
The United Federation of Planets welcomes you to Camp Khitomer.
She`s out here somewhere.
- But if she`s cloaked...
- Then all we have is a radiation surge.
By the time we`re close enough to record it, we`re ashes.
2.09... 2.06... 2.03...
- Close enough to beam down?
- Not yet. ln two minutes. 1 .58.
- Go to impulse power for Khitomer.
- Aye, sir.
Let us redefine progress to mean that just because we can do a thing it does not necessarily follow that we must do that thing.
- Uhura?
- Nothing, Captain.
If she`s here, she`s rigged for silent running.
Coming up on transporter range in 57 seconds.
Transporter room.
Stand by to beam down.
53... 48 seconds.
44... I can see you, Kirk.
Chang.
Can you see me?
Now, be honest, Captain.
Warrior to warrior.
You do prefer it this way, don`t you?
As it was meant to be.
No peace in our time.
"Once more unto the breach, dear friends... "
- This is fun.
- Reverse engines.
All astern.
One and a half impulse power.
Back off!
What`s she waiting for?
Probably attempting to ascertain why we are reversing.
Wondering whether we detect her.
Incoming!
- ln range?
- Not yet, sir.
Come on!
- She`ll fly apart.
- Fly her apart, then!
Many speculated about my father`s motives.
Some said he was an idealist.
Others said he had no choice.
If Praxis had not exploded, his idealism wouldn`t have found expression.
We are a proud race.
We are here because we intend to go on being proud.
- Go to auxiliary power!
- Auxiliary circuits destroyed.
"Tickle us, do we not laugh?
Prick us, do we not bleed?
"Wrong us, shall we not revenge?"
Gas.
Gas, Captain.
Under impulse power she expends fuel, like all vessels.
We call it "plasma", but it is merely ionised gas.
What about our equipment to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
The thing`s got to have a tailpipe.
Doctor, would you assist me in performing surgery on a torpedo?
Fascinating.
Hard to starboard.
The proposed agenda is as follows:
The evacuation of Kronos has been calculated within the 50-Earth-year time-span.
Phase 1 : preparation for evacuation...
Captain, she`s packing quite a wallop.
Shields weakening.
Shields up!
All right, now we`re giving them something else to shoot at.
The game`s afoot.
- Excelsior`s been hit!
- "Our revels now are ended", Kirk.
"Cry `Havoc`, and let slip the dogs of war."
- Bones, where`s my torpedo?
- Bet you wished you`d stayed in bed.
Shields collapsing!
The key, please.
Time is short.
- The hull has been compromised.
- l wonder how bad.
Connect echobars.
...discuss the report on phase 2.
- Alter circuit A.
- Sensor.
...we commence within minutes of the preparation.
- "l am constant as the Northern star. " - l`d give real money if he`d shut up.
Plate, please.
...and assimilation will consume...
We`ve got a heartbeat.
...with the Klingon Empire...
Key, please.
- Where`s that torpedo?
- She`s ready.
Lock and load!
Fire!
"To be...or not...
"...to be."
Target that explosion and fire.
Fire!
This work will occupy us throughout most of the week.
I hope that the delegation can implement the provisions of Phase 1 by the first of next month.
As you know, time is of the essence.
Out of the way!
Mr President!
Mr President!
Kirk, Enterprise.
- Arrest those men!
- Arrest yourself!
We`ve got a full confession.
- This is not Klingon blood.
- Cartwright.
Just a minute.
lt`s Colonel West!
What`s happened?
What`s the meaning of all of this?
lt`s about the future, Madam Chancellor.
Some people think the future means the end of history.
We haven`t run out of history quite yet.
Your father called the future "the undiscovered country".
People can be very frightened of change.
You`ve restored my father`s faith.
And you`ve restored my son`s.
Once again, we`ve saved civilisation as we know it.
And they`re not going to prosecute.
They could have prosecuted me.
I felt like Valeris.
They don`t arrest people for having feelings.
And it`s a good thing, too. lf they did, we`d all have to turn ourselves in.
- Captain Kirk.
- Captain Sulu.
As much to the crew of the Enterprise, I owe you my thanks.
Nice to see you in action one more time, Captain Kirk.
Take care.
- My God, that`s a big ship.
- Not so big as her captain.
So...this is goodbye?
lt`s about time we got underway ourselves.
Captain, I have orders from Starfleet Command.
We`re to put back to space dock immediately...to be decommissioned.
If I were human, I believe my response would be:
"Go to hell."
If I were human.
Course heading, Captain?
"Second star to the right.
"And straight on `til morning."
Captain`s log.
Stardate 9529. 1.
This is the final cruise of the Starship Enterprise under my command.
This ship, and her history, will shortly become the care of another crew.
To them and their posterity will we commit our future.
They`ll continue the voyages we began and journey to all the undiscovered countries, boldly going where no man, where no one has gone before.
We've lost gravity!
We are betrayed!
Find Chang.
Restoring auxiliary gravity.
Attack them now, while we still can!
Attack or be slaves in their world.
We can take whole by force, what they propose to divide.
War is obsolete, General, as we are in danger of becoming.
Better to die on our feet than live on our knees.
That wasn't what my father wanted.
Again.
Again!
This is listening post Morska.
What ship is that?
Over.
We am thy freighter...
Ursva.
Six weeks out of Kronos.
What is your destination?
Over.
We is condemning food...
...things and supplies.
things and supplies.
Don't catch any bugs!
They were beamed aboard a Federation starship.
I could trace...
Escaped.
Kirk cannot know the location of the peace conference.
Are you sure?
Will you take that chance?
Helmsman, make course to intercept Enterprise.
What's she doing?
Protect the Chancellor!

Stardate 9521.6.
Captain's log U.S.S. Excelsior.
Hikaru Sulu commanding.
After three years I've concluded my first assignment as master of this vessel cataloguing gaseous planetary anomalies in Beta Quadrant.
We're heading home under full impulse power.
I'm pleased to report that ship and crew have functioned well.
According to this, we've completed our survey of the entire sector.
I have an energy wave at 240 degrees mark six port.
Visual!
My...
God!
Shields.
Shields!
She's not answering her helm.
Starboard thrusters.
Turn her into the wave.
Go to impulse power.
- Damage report.
- Checking all systems.
- That was no meteor shower.
- Negative, sir.
The sub-space shock-wave originated at bearing 323.75.
Location...
It's Praxis, sir.
It's a Klingon moon.
Praxis is their key energy production facility.
Send to Klingon High Command. "This is Excelsior, a Federation Starship."
"We have monitored a large explosion in your sector."
- "Do you require assistance?"
- Aye, sir.
- Mr Vultane, any more data?
- I've confirmed Praxis' location, but...
- I cannot confirm Praxis' existence.
- On screen.
- Magnify.
- Computer enhancement.
- Praxis?
- What's left of it, sir.
Captain, I'm getting a message from Praxis.
Let's have it.
This is Brigadier Kerla, speaking for the High Command.
There has been an incident on Praxis.
However, everything is under control.
We have no need for assistance.
Obey treaty stipulations and remain outside the Neutral Zone.
This transmission ends now.
- An incident?
- Do we report this, sir?
Are you kidding?
- What are we doing here?
- Maybe it's a retirement party.
That suits me.
I just bought a boat.
I'm supposed to be chairing a seminar at the Academy.
- Isn't this just for top brass?
- Where is Sulu?
Captain Sulu?
On assignment.
Where's Spock?
This briefing is classified.
Ladies and gentlemen, the C-in-C.
As you were.
I'll break this information down succinctly.
The Klingon empire has 50 years of life left.
For full details, I'm turning this briefing over to Federation Special Envoy.
Good morning.
Two months ago a Federation Starship monitored an explosion on Praxis.
We believe it was caused by over-mining and insufficient safety precautions.
The moon's decimation means deadly pollution of their ozone.
They will have depleted their oxygen supply in 50 Earth years.
Due to their enormous military budget the Klingon economy doesn't have the resources to combat this catastrophe.
Last month, at the behest of the Vulcan Ambassador, -
- I opened a dialogue with Gorkon, Chancellor of the Klingon High Council.
He proposes to commence negotiations at once.
Negotiations for what?
The dismantling of our space stations and bases along the Neutral Zone, an end to 70 years of hostility, which the Klingons can no longer afford.
Bill, are we talking about mothballing the Starfleet?
Our exploration and scientific programs would be unaffected, but...
I must protest!
To offer Klingons safe haven within Federation space is suicide.
Klingons would become the alien trash of the galaxy.
If we dismantle the fleet, we'd be defenceless before an aggressive species on our territory.
The opportunity here is to bring them to their knees.
Then we'll be in a better position to dictate terms.
- Sir...
- Captain Kirk?
The Klingons have never been trustworthy.
I agree with Admiral Cartwright.
This is a terrifying idea.
It is imperative that we act now to support the Gorkon initiative, lest more conservative elements persuade his empire that it's better to attempt a military solution and die fighting.
You, Captain Kirk, are to be our first olive branch.
We are to rendezvous with the vessel which is bringing Gorkon to Earth and to escort him safely through Federation space.
Me?
There are Klingons who feel the same about the peace treaty as yourself, but they'll think twice about attacking the Enterprise under your command.
I have personally vouched for you in this matter.
You have personally vouched?
You will extend Chancellor Gorkon full diplomatic courtesy, Captain.
- A full Ambassador is better equipped...
- If there's no further business I wish you and your crew Godspeed.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
I remind you this meeting is classified.
I don't know whether to congratulate you or not, Jim.
I wouldn't.
We volunteered?
There's an old Vulcan proverb.
"Only Nixon could go to China."
How could you vouch for me?
- That's arrogant presumption.
- My father requested that I open...
I know your father is the Vulcan Ambassador, but you know how I feel.
- They're animals.
- Jim...
- There is an historic opportunity here.
- Don't believe them!
Don't trust them.
- They're dying.
- Let them die.
Has it occurred to you that this crew is due to stand down in three months?
We've done our bit for king and country.
You should have trusted me.
Control, this is S-D 103, approach to Space dock.
Over.
You are clear to deliver Captain Kirk and party to N.C.C. 1701 Alpha.
- Captain on the bridge!
- As you were.
Lieutenant?
Val'eris, sir.
We were told you needed a helmsman, so I volunteered.
It is agreeable to see you again.
She was the first Vulcan to graduate at the top of her class at the Academy.
- You must be very proud.
- I don't believe so, sir.
She's a Vulcan, alright.
Let's get this over with.
Departure stations.
- Scotty?
Did you find the engine room?
- Right where I left it.
Stand by.
Uhura, get me the dock master.
Control tower reading, sir.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
This is Control.
Permission to depart granted. 30 seconds for port gates.
- Clear all moorings.
- Awaiting port gates from this mark.
- All lines clear.
- Aft thrusters.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
1 quarter impulse power.
Captain, regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock.
Jim...
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
Aye, sir.
Captain's log.
Stardate 9522.6.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I can never forgive them for the death of my boy.
To escort the Chancellor of the Klingon High Council to a peace summit is problematic, at best.
Spock says this could be an historic occasion.
I'd like to believe him.
But how on Earth can history get past people like me?
- Sorry.
- You could have knocked.
We are almost at the rendezvous, sir.
I thought that you would like to know.
Permission to speak freely, sir.
It is an honour to serve with you.
You piloted well out of space dock, Lieutenant.
I've always wanted to try that.
You've done well, Val'eris.
As your sponsor at the Academy I've followed your career with satisfaction.
And as a Vulcan, you have exceeded my expectations.
I do not understand this representation.
It's a depiction from ancient Earth mythology.
"The expulsion from Paradise."
- Why keep it in your quarters?
- To remind me that all things end.
It is of endings that I wish to speak.
Sir, I address you as a kindred intellect.
Do you not recognise that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
History is replete with turning points.
You must have faith.
- Faith?
- The universe will unfold as it should.
- Is that logical?
Surely we must...
- Logic, logic, logic.
Logic is the beginning of wisdom, Val'eris.
Not the end.
This will be my final voyage on board this vessel as a member of her crew.
Nature abhors a vacuum.
I intend you to replace me.
I could only succeed you, sir.
Now hear this.
All officers to the bridge.
Klingon battle cruiser off the port bow.
All Officers to the bridge.
Captain on the bridge!
Shall we raise our shields, Captain?
I've never been this close.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
- Uhura, hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Right standard rudder.
Bring us alongside.
Right standard rudder.
Z plus 5 degrees.
Channel is open, Captain.
This is the Starship Enterprise.
Captain James T. Kirk commanding.
This is Kronos One.
I am Chancellor Gorkon.
We've been ordered to escort you to your meeting on Earth.
Thank you.
Would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard the Enterprise as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We would be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 19:30 hours.
I shall look forward to that.
I hope you're happy.
Captain!
There is a supply of Romulan ale aboard.
It might make the evening pass more... smoothly.
Officer thinking, Lieutenant.
Guess who's coming to dinner.
Energize.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- Captain Kirk.
May I present Captain Spock, whom I believe you know.
Captain, face to face at last.
You have my thanks.
Chancellor.
Gentlemen.
This is my daughter, Azetbur...
My military advisor, Brigadier Kerla and this is General Chang, my chief of staff.
I have so wanted to meet you, Captain.
- I'm not sure how to take that.
- Sincere admiration, Kirk.
From one warrior to another.
Right...
This way.
You might enjoy a brief tour.
- They all look alike.
- What about that smell?
You know only top of the line models can even talk...
- You men have work?
- Yes, ma'am.
Then snap to it.
I offer a toast.
The undiscovered country.
- The future.
- The undiscovered country.
Hamlet, act 3, scene 1.
You have not experienced Shake- speare until you've read him in Klingon.
Captain Kirk.
I thought Romulan ale was illegal.
An advantage of being 1,000 light years from Federation headquarters.
To you, Chancellor Gorkon.
One of the architects of our future.
Chancellor!
Perhaps we are looking at something of that future here.
Tell me, Captain Kirk.
Would you be willing to give up Starfleet?
The Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace.
I wouldn't dispute my first officer.
Starfleet has always been...
There's no need to mince words.
In space, all warriors are cold warriors.
General, are you fond of...
Shakespeare?
We believe all planets have a sovereign claim to inalienable human rights.
"Inalien..." If you could only hear yourselves.
"Human rights." Why, the very name is racist.
The Federation is a "homo sapiens only" club.
Present company excepted, of course.
We know where this is leading - the annihilation of our culture.
That's not true.
No!
"To be or not to be"...
That is the question which preoccupies our people.
- We need breathing room.
- Earth.
Hitler, 1938.
I beg your pardon.
Well...
I see we have a long way to go.
We must do this again sometime.
You don't trust me, do you?
I don't blame you.
If there is to be a brave new world, our generation is going to have the hardest time living in it.
- Captain Spock.
- Chancellor.
Madam.
Captain.
Well, most kind.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
Hmm, Captain?
"Have we not heard the chimes at midnight?"
Thank God!
- Did you see the way they ate?
- Terrible table manners.
I doubt our own behaviour will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy.
I'm going to sleep this off.
Is there any other way we can screw up tonight?
I'm going to go find a pot of black coffee.
The Enterprise hosted Chancellor Gorkon to dinner last night.
Our manners weren't exactly Emily Post.
To the galley
- Romulan ale no longer to be served at diplomatic functions.
Captain Kirk, will you please join me on the bridge?
Captain Kirk?
- Captain.
- What is it?
- I find this curious.
- Spock, I'm really tired.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
- Where?
- It appears to emanate from us.
The Enterprise?
Val'eris, do you know anything about a radiation surge?
Chekov?
Only the size of my head.
I know what you mean.
- What's happened?
- We've fired on the Chancellor's ship.
Torpedo room!
Please confirm, have we fired?
- Uhura, monitor.
- Aye, sir.
- Direct hit.
- Confirmed, sir.
We've lost gravity!
We are betrayed!
This is the bridge.
Do you read me?
- Did we fire those torpedoes?
- Negative.
We're still fully loaded.
Find Chang.
Unable to confirm or deny firing the torpedoes.
- Hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Kronos One, this is Enterprise.
Do you read?
It's very hard to make out.
There's been weapons firing and a lot of shouting.
- She's still listing.
- She's spinning out of control.
Restoring auxiliary gravity...
Have you not a shred of decency in you, Kirk?
We come in peace, and you blatantly defy that peace.
For that, I shall blow you out of the stars.
- We haven't fired.
- Captain...
According to our data banks, we have.
Twice...
Captain, they're coming about.
- They're preparing to fire.
- Shields up, Captain?
- Captain, our shields.
- Shields up, Captain?
Signal our surrender.
We surrender!
- This is Enterprise.
We surrender.
- If they fire, with our shields down we will not be able to respond.
- Repeat, Enterprise surrenders.
- Are we firing torpedoes?
- I wish I knew.
- I'm going aboard.
Spock, take the con.
- I involved you, I will go.
No, I'll go.
We'll not be the instigators of war on the eve of universal peace.
I'm going too, they may need a doctor.
Uhura, tell them we're coming, and tell them we're unarmed.
- Have you lost your mind?
!
- I don't understand what's happened.
We're here to help.
Follow me.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- My God!
What has happened here?
- You dare to feign ignorance?
- What happened?
With a direct torpedo hit, you crippled our gravitational field and two of your Starfleet crew beamed aboard wearing magnetic boots.
- Aren't you carrying a surgeon?
- We were until this disgrace.
Then for god's sake, let me help.
I've got a pulse - we can move him.
I need light.
Put him on the table.
Hold him!
Hold him while I stabilize him.
I said hold him!
Sweet Jesus.
- Can you?
- I don't even know his anatomy.
- His wounds are not closing.
- He's killing him!
He's gone into some kind of damned arrest.
Come on, dammit!
Come on!
He's not responding.
Don't let it end this way, Captain.
Under article 184 of your Interstellar Law I'm placing you under arrest.
You're charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
He tried to save him.
They've been arrested.
Mr Spock, we've got to do something.
I assume command of this ship as of 02:30 hours.
Commander Uhura, notify Starfleet headquarters and request instructions.
We cannot allow them to be taken to Kronos as prisoners.
Opening fire will not retrieve them, and we must avoid an armed conflict.
We will be able to follow the Captain's movements.
- How did you achieve this?
- Time is precious.
We must piece together what happened here tonight.
According to our data bank, this ship fired those torpedoes.
- No way!
- I sympathize, but we need evidence.
Please accompany me.
And if we cannot piece together what happened?
What then, sir?
In that case, Mr Chekov, it resides in the purview of the diplomats.
The Chancellor of the High Council is dead!
The result of an unprovoked attack while he travelled to see you under a flag of truce on a mission of peace!
Captain Kirk was legally arrested for the crime.
He and Dr. McCoy boarded Kronos One of their own free will.
- None of these facts are in dispute.
- I have ordered an investigation.
- In the meantime...
- In the meantime we expect the Federation to abide by the articles of Interstellar Law.
Kirk and Dr. McCoy will stand trial for the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon.
Out of the question.
Ambassador Sarek, can we get them extradited?
Mr President, I share a measure of personal responsibility in this matter, but I am obliged to confirm my esteemed colleagues legal interpretation.
What is the position of the Romulan government?
I must concur with my colleagues.
You can't believe that Kirk assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council.
Mr President.
I don't know what to believe.
I'm waiting for your answer, sir.
This President is not above the law.
Mr President, Starfleet command is here from San Francisco.
- Mr President.
- Mr President.
Bill, Admiral Cartwright, please sit down.
Mr President, we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
I'm constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
Sir, would you please take a look at this.
We prepared Operation Retrieve based on the danger of terrorism between the Klingon empire and the Federation.
We can go in, rescue the hostages and get out in 24 hours with acceptable losses.
- We have the technology...
- Yes, yes.
But suppose you precipitate a full-scale war?
Then, quite frankly, we can clean their chronometers.
Mr President, they are vulnerable.
There will never be a better time.
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be.
I'll bear that in mind.
Thank you, gentlemen, that's all for now.
Mr President.
Sir...
Those men have literally saved this planet.
And now they're going to save it again.
By standing trial.
Report back on the double.
Do you read?
- We're to report back at once.
- We can't abandon Kirk and McCoy.
400 years ago, on Earth, workers who felt their livelyhood threatened flung their wooden shoes called "sabots" into the machines to stop them.
Hence the word "sabotage".
We experience technical malfunction.
All back-up systems inoperative.
Excellent.
I mean... too bad.
Mr President, I have been named chancellor in my father's place.
Madam Chancellor, you have my condolences on your loss.
I assure you that this shameful deed will not...
Let us come to the point.
You want this conference to go forward.
I will attend in one week, on one condition.
We will not extradite the prisoners, and you will not attempt to rescue them.
We would consider any such attempt an act of war.
We hope you'll be our guest here on Earth.
After recent events, you will understand if I prefer a neutral site.
And in the interest of security, let us keep the location secret for now.
As you wish, Madam Chancellor.
Attack them now, while we still can.
Attack or be slaves in their world.
We can take whole by force, what they propose to divide.
War is obsolete, General.
As we are in danger of becoming.
Better to die on our feet than live on our knees.
That wasn't what my father wanted.
Your father was killed for what he wanted.
The peace process will go forward.
Kirk...
Kirk will pay for my father's death.
It is as I said, Mr Spock.
Inventory registers every torpedo.
Yet the data banks insist we fired.
- One computer is lying.
- A computer doesn't lie!
Precisely.
Therefore we must inspect each torpedo visually.
That could take hours!
And if they're all there?
Then someone forged an entry in the data banks.
Gorkon's daughter has been named Chancellor.
It was on the news.
I'll bet that bitch killed her father.
- Her own father?
- It is an old story, sir.
They don't place the same value on life as we do, you know that.
Take my word, she did not shed one bloody tear.
Hardly conclusive, since Klingons have no tear-ducts.
Lieutenant, any response from Starfleet since our dispatch?
Yes, sir.
And?
Commander Uhura is experiencing technical difficulties, sir.
Curious.
Very well.
For 24 hours, we will agree this conversation didn't take place.
- A lie?
- An omission.
In 24 hours we won't have a clue where Captain Kirk is.
- I know precisely where he will be.
- You do?
Where?
Kirk, Kirk, Kirk, Kirk...
It's a damn show trial.
The Enterprise fired on Kronos One without provocation.
The Chancellor and his advisors having been lulled into a false sense of security by an invitation to a dinner aboard Captain Kirk's vessel at precisely 19:30 hours that same evening.
Call your first witness.
After the first shot we lost our gravitational field.
I was weightless and couldn't function.
Then two Starfleet crewmen came towards me.
Or perhaps they merely wore Starfleet uniforms.
That remark is speculative.
I move that it be stricken.
We're interested in facts, not theories.
If the gravitational unit was not functioning, how could they walk?
They appeared to be wearing magnetic boots.
- Gravity boots?
- Dr. McCoy.
Would you be so good as to tell me what is your current medical status?
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
You have a singular wit, Doctor.
For 27 years I've been surgeon aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.
In three months I stand down.
You know...
I believe that you consumed rather a generous amount of Romulan ale in the officers mess on the night in question.
- Objection.
- Sustained.
We all did.
All of us.
That doesn't mean...
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
Barely.
Now be careful, Doctor.
Have you ever in your past saved patients as barely alive as he?
I didn't have the medical knowledge I needed for Klingon anatomy.
- I see.
- You where there.
You say you are due for retirement.
May I ask, do your hands shake?
- Objection!
- I was nervous.
No.
You were incompetent.
You were incompetent!
Whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink.
- The court will have to determine.
- My God, man.
I tried to save him!
I tried to save him.
I was desperate to save him.
He was the last best hope in the Universe for peace.
The witness is excused.
There we have it, citizens.
We have established the particulars of the crime.
And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair.
James Tiberius Kirk.
What would your favourite author say, Captain?
"Let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings."
Tell us your sad story, Kirk.
Tell us that you planned to take revenge for the death of your son.
- That's not true.
- Objection!
Captain Kirk has not been identified as the assassin.
I offer into the record this excerpt from the Captain's personal log.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I've never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Again!
Again!
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I've never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Are those your words?
Those words were spoken by me.
Objection!
My client's political views are not on trial.
On the contrary.
Captain Kirk's views are at the very heart of the matter.
His record shows him to be an insubordinate, unprincipled opportunist with a history of violating the chain of command whenever it suited him.
Continue.
The record shows that Captain Kirk once held the rank of Admiral and he was broken for taking matters into his own hands.
Do you deny being demoted for these charges.
Answer me now!
- I cannot deny it.
- You were demoted?
- For insubordination?
- On occasion, I have disobeyed orders.
Were you obeying or disobeying orders when you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?
I didn't know about it until we boarded the ship.
You still deny the Enterprise fired on Kronos One?
And you still deny your men beamed aboard and shot the Chancellor?
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I didn't witness.
Are you aware that as the captain of a ship, you are responsible for the actions of your men?
I am.
If it's proved that members of your crew carried out the assassination...
- They're setting us up.
Your Honours!
- Do not answer.
Captain Kirk, you will answer the question.
As Captain I'm responsible for the crew under my command.
Your Honours, the state rests.
Send to Commander Enterprise.
"We stand ready to assist you.
Captain Sulu, U.S.S. Excelsior."
It is the determination of this court that the prisoners are guilty as charged.
I wish to note for the record that all the evidence is circumstantial.
I beg the court to consider this when pronouncing its sentence.
So noted.
Captain James T. Kirk, Dr. Leonard McCoy.
In the interest of fostering amity for the forthcoming peace talks, the sentence of death is commuted.
It is the judgement of this court that, without possibility of reprieve or parole, you be taken from this place to the dilithium mines on the penal asteroid of Rura Penthe.
There to spend the rest of your natural lives.
Rura Penthe!
Known throughout the galaxy as the alien's graveyard.
Better to kill them now and get it over with.
Lieutenant.
The torpedo hit once again, please.
Hold.
It is Enterprise.
We fired.
That is not possible!
All weapons visually accounted for, sir.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains must be the truth.
What does that mean?
That if we cannot have fired those torpedoes, someone else did.
They didn't fire on themselves and there are no other ships present.
- There was a neutron surge.
- Not from us.
A neutron surge that big could only be produced by another ship.
- Kronos One?
- Too far away.
Very near us.
Possibly beneath us.
If there were a ship beneath us, the Klingons would have seen it.
Would they?
- A Bird of Prey?
- A Bird of Prey.
- Cloaked?
- They can't fired when they're cloaked.
All things being equal, I would agree.
However, things are not equal.
This one can.
- We must inform Starfleet Command.
- Of what?
A new weapon that's invisible?
They'll call us raving lunatics.
They'll say we'll say anything to exonerate the Captain.
And they would be correct.
We have no evidence.
Only a theory which happens to fit the facts.
Assuming you're right.
Why would they fire on their own President?
Indeed.
This ship will be searched from bow to stern.
I do not understand.
If there was a ship underneath us surely the assassins beamed aboard from that vessel, not Enterprise.
You're forgetting something, Mr Chekov.
According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
If we did, the killers are here.
If we did not, whoever altered the data banks is here.
In either case, what we are looking for is here.
- What are we looking for, sir?
- Lieutenant.
Two pairs of gravity boots.
This is the gulag Rura Penthe.
There is no stockades, no guard tower, no electronic frontier.
Only a magnetic shield prevents beaming.
Punishment means exile from prison to the surface.
On the surface, nothing can survive.
Work well, and you will be treated well.
Work badly, and you will die.
Oh, my God!
The universal translator has been confiscated.
I'm sorry?
He's definitely on about something, Jim.
If this is your spot, we'll move on.
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
- He's got it.
- And your coat.
I'm afraid not.
It wouldn't fit.
- Thanks.
- This will help keep you warm.
- I'm Martia.
You're Kirk and McCoy.
- How did you know that?
We don't get many presidential assassins.
- We didn't kill Gorkon.
- Of course not.
- But there's a reward for your death.
- That figures.
We've been set up.
Somebody up there wants you out of the way.
- Any progress?
- None.
A crew of 300 are looking everywhere, but the killers may still be among them.
Surely they have disposed of these boots by now.
Would it not have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
Logic must give way to physics.
Gravity wasn't restored when they escaped.
Without the boots, they would have floated off the transporter pads.
Why not simply vaporize them?
Like this?
As you know, no one can fire an unauthorized phaser aboard a starship.
Suppose, when they returned, they threw the boots into the refuse.
I'm having the refuse searched.
If I'm correct, those boots will cling to the killer's necks like Tiberian bats.
They couldn't escape without them nor throw them out the window.
Those boots are here.
Somewhere.
- Did someone fire off a phaser?
- It's alright.
It's nothing.
Mr Spock, Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
- Who fired the...
- Ah, Mr Scott.
I hear you have difficulty with the warp drive.
How long do you need for repair?
There's nothing wrong with the bloody thing.
If we return to space dock, the killers can dispose of their footwear and we will never see the Captain or Dr. McCoy alive again.
- It could take weeks.
- Thank you.
Val'eris, inform Starfleet our warp drive is inoperative.
- A lie?
- An error.
We have lost all contact with the Captain and Dr. McCoy.
Yes, at the moment they're surrounded by a magnetic shield.
But if I know the Captain, he is deep into planning his escape.
You've got him where you want him, Jim!
- Are you alright?
- I think so.
- They'll respect you now.
- I was lucky that thing had knees.
That was not his knee.
Not everybody keep their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Anything you want to tell me?
See what you can do for him.
Let him know we're not holding a grudge.
Suppose he's holding a grudge?
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
- Do you want to get out of here?
- There's got to be a way.
Three months before retirement.
What a way to finish.
- We're not finished.
- Speak for yourself.
One day, one night...
Kobayashi Maru!
Bones!
Are you afraid of the future?
I believe that was the general idea that I was trying to convey.
- I don't mean this future.
- What is this - multiple choice?
Some people are afraid...
of what might happen.
- I was terrified.
- What terrified you, specifically?
No more neutral zone.
I was used to hating Klingons.
It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his words.
- Spock was right.
- We all felt exactly the same.
No.
Somebody felt a lot worse.
I'm beginning to understand why.
If you've got any bright ideas, now is the time.
Time is the problem.
You and I are nothing.
You heard the judge - the peace conference is on again.
Whoever killed Gorkon is bound to attempt another assassination.
Unless we can get out of here.
It's me
- Martia.
Listen.
No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
- Except us.
- It is possible.
I know how to get outside the shield.
- How do we fit in?
- Getting outside the shield is easy.
After that, you have to get us off the surface before we freeze.
Can you?
- It's possible.
- I can't make it alone.
You're the likeliest candidate to come here for months.
Candidate for what?
Go to lift 7 in the morning for mining duty.
I'll see you there.
Don't disappoint me.
- What is it with you, anyway?
- Still think we're finished?
More than ever.
Sorry to wake you, sir.
Starfleet requests any data we have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
What?
They're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to space dock, sir.
Signal Starfleet that we have no idea location Enterprise.
- Sir?
- You have hearing problems?
No, sir.
Klingon blood.
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
This is the first evidence which corroborates our theory.
Now we go to Starfleet?
We expand our search to include uniforms.
All uniforms?
Clear, sir.
Make a hole.
Coming through.
Coming through.
Sir!
Sir!
- I think we've been had.
- No, you weren't, Doctor.
Get off at the first level.
Follow the gang into the mine.
They don't take girls.
- You are crewman Dax?
- Yes.
What is the problem?
Perhaps you know Russian epic of Cinderella?
If shoe fits - wear it.
Mr Chekov...
Watch me.
What kind of creature is this?
Last night you two were...
Get in.
Come on.
We don't have a lot of time.
Hurry!
Up there.
Come on - climb!
Here, you'll need these.
Quickly!
Stay close.
- There they are.
- They emerge from the beaming shield.
Mr Scott, start your engines.
Mr Chekov, set course for Rura Penthe.
Mr Spock, Rura Penthe is deep inside the Klingon frontier.
- If we're discovered...
- Correct.
We need a feat of linguistic legerdemain and intrepidity before the Captain and Dr. McCoy freeze to death.
- Leave me, I'm finished.
- No!
Bones, I'm wearing a viridium patch on my back.
Spock slapped it there before we went on Gorkon's ship.
That cunning little Vulcan.
Come on!
We're in the clear.
Now that we're outside the shield, they can locate us two sectors away.
If they're even looking for us.
This is listening post Morska.
What ship is that, over?
We must respond.
A universal translator would be recognised.
We am thy freighter...
Ursva.
Six weeks out of Kronos.
"What is your destination, over?"
We is condemning food things and supplies.
Don't catch any bugs.
Would you mind explaining that little trick you do?
- I'm a Chameloid.
- I've heard about you.
Shape-shifters.
I thought you were mythical.
Give a girl a chance, Captain.
It takes a lot of effort.
I don't doubt it.
Stop me if I'm wrong, but do we have any way of knowing whether this is the real you?
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.
We're outside the shield.
Now it's your turn, Captain.
If you say so.
Are you crazy?
!
She didn't need our help.
Where did you get these convenient clothes?
Don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue.
It's to let them know where we are.
Ask her what she's getting in return.
A full pardon... which doesn't cover this.
An accident wasn't good enough.
Come on, Spock.
Good enough for one.
Two would have looked suspicious.
Killed while attempting escape.
That's convincing for both.
Surprise!
- Your friends are late.
- They'll be along.
- I can't believe I kissed you.
- Must have been your lifelong ambition.
Isn't it time you became something else?
I like it here.
Well, well, well...
What took you so long?
Kill him, he's the one.
Not me, you idiot - him!
- No witnesses.
- Killed while trying to escape.
- Damned clever, if you ask me.
- It's a classic.
- That's what he wanted.
- Who?
Who wanted us killed?
Since you're all going to die anyway, why not tell you?
His name is...
Damn it!
What the hell!
Son of a!
Couldn't you have waited two seconds?
He was about to explain the whole thing.
- You want to go back?
- Absolutely not!
This is the bridge.
We're still in Klingon space.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
They were beamed aboard a Federation Starship.
I could trace...
Escaped.
Kirk cannot know the location of the peace conference.
Are you sure?
Will you take that chance?
Helmsman, make course to intercept Enterprise.
The Klingons have a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked.
- She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
- So that's it.
We believe that Gorkon's murderers are aboard this ship.
- Has the peace conference begun?
- Who knows?
The location is secret.
- There's always something.
- Captain!
Mr Spock!
I found the uniforms with the Klingon blood on them.
But the uniforms belong to these two men.
Burke and Samno.
Not anymore.
Phaser on "stun" at close range.
First rule of assassination - kill the assassins.
- Now we're back to square one.
- Can I talk to you?
- Why weren't they vaporized?
- It would set off the alarm.
It's possible.
Now hear this.
Now hear this.
Court reporter to sick bay.
Code blue - urgent.
Statements to be taken at once from Yeomen Burke and Samno.
Repeat, court reporter to sick bay.
Code blue - urgent.
Statements to be taken.
Repeat, statements to be taken from Yeomen Burke and Samno.
You have to shoot.
If you are logical, you have to shoot.
- I do not want to.
- What you want is irrelevant.
What you've chosen is at hand.
I'd just as soon you didn't.
The operation is over.
I did not fire.
You cannot prove anything.
Yes, I can.
At my trial my personal log was used against me.
How long did you wait outside my quarters before I noticed you?
You knew?
I tried to tell you, but you would not listen.
Neither of us was hearing very well that night.
There were things I tried to tell you, about having faith.
You have betrayed the Federation.
All of you.
- And what have you've been doing?
- Saving Starfleet.
Klingons cannot be trusted.
Sir...
You said so yourself.
They killed your son.
Did you not wish Gorkon dead?
"Let them die", you said.
Did I misinterpret you?
And you were right.
They conspired with us to assassinate their own Chancellor.
How trustworthy can they be?
Klingons and Federation members conspiring together.
- Who is "us"?
- All who stands to lose from peace.
Names, Lieutenant.
My comrades will make certain all your transmissions are jammed.
- Names, Lieutenant!
- I do not remember.
A lie?
A choice.
Spock.
Admiral Cartwright.
From Starfleet?
Who else?
General...
Chang.
- Who else?
- Romulan Ambassador and others.
Where is the peace conference?
Where is the peace conference?
She does not know.
Then we're dead.
I have been dead before.
Contact Excelsior.
- She'll have the co-ordinates.
- I've already got it, sir.
- Standing by, Captain Kirk.
- Sulu.
You realize that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations.
I'm sorry, Captain.
Your message is breaking up.
Bless you, Sulu.
Where is the peace conference?
They'll attempt another assassination.
It's at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border.
I'm sending the co-ordinates on a coded frequency.
We'll need more than that.
There's a Bird of Prey on the look-out for us that can fire when cloaked.
Surely not.
How many of those things are there?
Come on, Lieutenant.
- Just the prototype.
- Do you hear that?
I'm getting under way now.
We're in Alpha Quadrant.
The chances of our reaching the conference in time are slim.
- When does this conference start?
- According to my information - today.
- Thank you, Captain Sulu.
- Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
Spock?
I prefer it dark.
- Dining on ashes?
- You were right.
It was arrogant presumption on my part that got us into this situation.
You and the Doctor might have been killed.
The night is young.
You said it yourself, it was logical.
Peace is worth a few personal risks.
You're a great one for logic.
I'm a great one for rushing in where angels fear to tread.
We're both extremists.
Reality is probably somewhere in between.
I couldn't get past the death of my son.
I was prejudiced by her accomplishments as a Vulcan.
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was.
Is it possible that we two, you and I, have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?
Would that constitute a joke?
- It wasn't your fault.
- I was responsible.
- For no actions but your own.
- That's not what you said at your trial.
That was as captain of the ship.
Human beings...
We both know that I am not human.
Do you want to know something?
Everybody's human.
I find that remark... insulting.
Come, I need you.
Madam Chancellor, members of the diplomatic corps honoured guests.
The United Federation of Planets welcomes you to Camp Khitomer.
She's out here somewhere.
- But if she's cloaked...
- Then all we have is a radiation surge.
By the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes.
2.06... 2.03...
- Close enough to beam down?
- Not yet.
In two minutes. 1.58.
Go to impulse power for Khitomer.
Let us redefine progress to mean that just because we can do a thing it does not necessarily follow that we must do that thing.
- Uhura?
- Nothing, Captain.
If she's here, she's rigged for silent running.
Coming up on transporter range in 57 seconds.
Transporter room.
Stand by to beam down.
53... 48 seconds.
44...
I can see you, Kirk.
Chang.
Can you see me?
Now be honest, Captain.
Warrior to warrior.
You do prefer it this way, don't you?
As it was meant to be.
No peace in our time.
"Once more unto the breach, dear friends."
- This is fun.
- Reverse engines.
All astern.
One and a half impulse power.
Back off!
What's she doing?
What's she waiting for?
Probably attempting to ascertain why we are reversing.
Wondering whether we detect her.
Incoming!
- In range?
- Not yet, sir.
Come on!
- She'll fly apart.
- Fly her apart, then!
Many speculated about my father's motives.
Some said he was an idealist.
Others said he had no choice.
If Praxis had not exploded, his idealism wouldn't have found expression.
We are a proud race.
We are here because we intend to go on being proud.
- Go to auxiliary power!
- Auxiliary circuits destroyed.
"Tickle us, do we not laugh?
Prick us, do we not bleed?"
"Wrong us, shall we not revenge?"
Gas.
Gas, Captain.
Under impulse power she expands fuel, like all vessels.
We call it "plasma", but it is merely ionised gas.
What about our equipment to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
The thing's got to have a tail-pipe.
Doctor, would you assist me in performing surgery on a torpedo?
Fascinating.
Hard to starboard.
The proposed agenda is as follows:
The evacuation of Kronos has been calculated within the 50 Earth year time span.
Phase 1 - preparation for evacuation...
Captain, she's packing quite a wallop.
Shields weakening.
Shields up!
Alright, now we're giving them something else to shoot at.
The game's afoot.
- Excelsior's been hit!
- "Our revels now are ended", Kirk.
"Cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war."
- Bones, where's my torpedo?
- Bet you wished you'd stayed in bed.
Shields collapsing!
The key, please.
Time is short.
- The hull has been compromised.
- I wonder how bad.
Connect echo-bars.
...discuss the report on phase 2.
- Alter circuit A.
- Sensor.
...we commence within minutes of the preparation.
- "I am constant as the Northern star."
- I'd give real money, if he'd shut up.
Plate, please.
...and assimilation will consume...
We've got a heart beat.
...with the Klingon Empire...
Key, please.
- Where's that torpedo?
- She's ready.
Lock and load!
Fire!
"To be... or not" "to be."
Target that explosion and fire.
Fire!
This work will occupy us throughout most of the week.
I hope that the delegation can implement the provisions of Phase 1 by the first of next month.
As you know, time is of the essence.
Out of the way!
Mr President!
Mr President!
Kirk, Enterprise.
Protect the Chancellor!
- Arrest those men!
- Arrest yourself!
We've got a full confession.
- This is not Klingon blood.
- Cartwright.
Just a minute.
It's Colonel West!
What's happened?
What's the mean of all of this?
It's about the future, Madam Chancellor.
Some people think the future means the end of history.
We haven't run out of history quite yet.
Your father called the future "the undiscovered country".
People can be very frightened of change.
You've restored my father's faith.
And you've restored my son's.
Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
And they're not going to prosecute.
They could have prosecuted me.
I felt like Val'eris.
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
And it's a good thing, too.
If they did, we'd all have to turn ourselves in.
- Captain Kirk.
- Captain Sulu.
As much to the crew of the Enterprise, I owe you my thanks.
Nice to see you in action one more time, Captain Kirk.
Take care.
- My God, that's a big ship.
- Not so big as her captain.
So...
This is goodbye?
It's about time we got underway ourselves.
Captain, I have orders from Starfleet Command.
We're to put back to space dock immediately... to be decommissioned.
If I were human, I believe my response would be:
"Go to hell."
If I were human.
Course heading, Captain?
Second star to the right.
And straight on 'til morning.
Captain's log, stardate 9529. 1.
This is the final cruise of the Starship Enterprise under my command.
This ship, and her history will shortly become the care of another crew.
To them and their posterity will we commit our future.
They'll continue the voyages we have begun and journey to all the undiscovered countries boldly going where no man, where no one has gone before.
Stardate 9521.6.
Captain's log U.S.S. Excelsior.
Hikaru Sulu commanding.
After three years I've concluded my first assignment as master of this vessel cataloguing gaseous planetary anomalies in Beta Quadrant.
We're heading home under full impulse power.
I'm pleased to report that ship and crew have functioned well.
According to this,we've completed our survey of the entire sector.
I have an energy wave at 240 degrees mark six port.
Visual!
My¡­ God!
Shields.
Shields!
She's not answering her helm.
Starboard thrusters.
Turn her into the wave.
Go to impulse power.

- Checking all systems.
- That was no meteor shower.
- Negative,sir.
The sub-space shock-wave originated at bearing 323.75.
Location¡­ It's Praxis,sir.
It's a Klingon moon.
Praxis is their key energy production facility.
Send to Klingon High Command. ¡°This is Excelsior,a Federation Starship.¡±
¡°We have monitored a large explosion in your sector.¡±
- ¡°Do you require assistance?
¡±
- Aye,sir.
- Mr Vultane,any more data?
- I've confirmed Praxis' location,but¡­
- I cannot confirm Praxis' existence.
- On screen.
- Magnify.
- Computer enhancement.
- Praxis?
- What's left of it,sir.
Captain,I'm getting a message from Praxis.
Let's have it.
This is Brigadier Kerla, speaking for the High Command.
There has been an incident on Praxis.
However,everything is under control.
We have no need for assistance.
Obey treaty stipulations and remain outside the Neutral Zone.
This transmission ends now.
- An incident?
- Do we report this,sir?
Are you kidding?
- What are we doing here?
- Maybe it's a retirement party.
That suits me.
I just bought a boat.
I'm supposed to be chairing a seminar at the Academy.
- Isn't this just for top brass?
- Where is Sulu?
Captain Sulu?
On assignment.
Where's Spock?
This briefing is classified.
Ladies and gentlemen,the C-in-C.
As you were.
I'll break this information down succinctly.
The Klingon empire has 50 years of life left.
For full details,I'm turning this briefing over to the Federation Special Envoy.
Good morning.
Two months ago a Federation Starship monitored an explosion on Praxis.
We believe it was caused by over-mining and insufficient safety precautions.
The moon's decimation means a deadly pollution of their ozone.
They will have depleted their oxygen supply in 50 Earth years.
Due to their enormous military budget the Klingon economy doesn't have the resources to combat this catastrophe.
Last month,at the behest of the Vulcan Ambassador,-
- I opened a dialogue with Gorkon, Chancellor of the Klingon High Council.
He proposes to commence negotiations at once.
Negotiations for what?
The dismantling of our space stations and bases along the Neutral Zone.
An end to 70 years of hostility, which the Klingons can no longer afford.
Bill,are we talking about mothballing the Starfleet?
Our exploration and scientific programs would be unaffected,but¡­
I must protest!
To offer Klingons safe haven within Federation space is suicide.
Klingons would become the alien trash of the galaxy.
If we dismantle the fleet, we'd be defenceless before an aggressive species on our territory.
The opportunity here is to bring them to their knees.
Then we'll be in a better position to dictate terms.
- Sir¡­
- Captain Kirk?
The Klingons have never been trustworthy.
I agree with Admiral Cartwright.
This is a terrifying idea.
It is imperative that we act now to support the Gorkon initiative, lest more conservative elements persuade his empire that it's better to attempt a military solution and die fighting.
You,Captain Kirk, are to be our first olive branch.
We are to rendezvous with the vessel which is bringing Gorkon to Earth and to escort him safely through Federation space.
Me?
There are Klingons who feel the same about the peace treaty as yourself, but they'll think twice about attacking the Enterprise under your command.
I have personally vouched for you in this matter.
You have personally vouched¡­?
You will extend Chancellor Gorkon full diplomatic courtesy,Captain.
- A full Ambassador is better equipped¡­
- If there's no further business¡­
¡­I wish you and your crew Godspeed.
Thank you,ladies and gentlemen.
I remind you this meeting is classified.
I don't know whether to congratulate you or not,Jim.
I wouldn't.
We volunteered?
There's an old Vulcan proverb. ¡°Only Nixon could go to China.¡±
How could you vouch for me?
- That's arrogant presumption.
- My father requested that I open¡­
I know your father is the Vulcan Ambassador,but you know how I feel.
- They're animals.
- Jim¡­
- There is an historic opportunity here.
- Don't believe them!
Don't trust them.
- They're dying.
- Let them die.
Has it occurred to you that this crew is due to stand down in three months?
We've done our bit for king and country.
You should have trusted me.
Control,this is S-D 103, approach to Space dock.
Over.
You are clear to deliver Captain Kirk and party to N.C.C. 1701 Alpha.
- Captain on the bridge!
- As you were.
Lieutenant¡­?
Val'eris,sir.
We were told you needed a helmsman,so I volunteered.
It is agreeable to see you again.
She was the first Vulcan to graduate at the top of her class at the Academy.
- You must be very proud.
- I don't believe so,sir.
She's a Vulcan,alright.
Let's get this over with.
Departure stations.
- Scotty?
Did you find the engine room?
- Right where I left it.
Stand by.
Uhura,get me the dock master.
Control tower reading,sir.
Control,this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
This is Control.
Permission to depart granted. 30 seconds for port gates.
- Clear all moorings.
- Awaiting port gates from this mark.
- All lines clear.
- Aft thrusters.
Thank you,Lieutenant. 1 quarter impulse power.
Captain,regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock.
Jim¡­
You heard the order,Lieutenant.
Aye,sir.
Captain's log.
Stardate 9522.6.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I can never forgive them for the death of my boy.
To escort the Chancellor of the Klingon High Council to a peace summit is problematic,at best.
Spock says this could be an historic occasion.
I'd like to believe him.
But how on Earth can history get past people like me?
- Sorry.
- You could have knocked.
We are almost at the rendezvous,sir.
I thought that you would like to know.
Permission to speak freely,sir.
It is an honour to serve with you.
You piloted well out of space dock, Lieutenant.
I've always wanted to try that.
You've done well,Val'eris.
As your sponsor at the Academy I've followed your career with satisfaction.
And as a Vulcan, you have exceeded my expectations.
I do not understand this representation.
It's a depiction from ancient Earth mythology.
¡°The expulsion from Paradise.¡±
- Why keep it in your quarters?
- To remind me that all things end.
It is of endings that I wish to speak.
Sir,I address you as a kindred intellect.
Do you not recognise¡­
¡­that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
History is replete with turning points.
You must have faith.
- Faith?
- The universe will unfold as it should.
- Is that logical?
Surely we must¡­
- Logic,logic,logic.
Logic is the beginning of wisdom, Val'eris.
Not the end.
This will be my final voyage on board this vessel as a member of her crew.
Nature abhors a vacuum.
I intend you to replace me.
I could only succeed you,sir.
Now hear this.
All officers to the bridge.
Klingon battle cruiser off the port bow.
All Officers to the bridge.
Captain on the bridge!
Shall we raise our shields,Captain?
I've never been this close.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
- Uhura,hailing frequencies.
- Aye,sir.
Right standard rudder.
Bring us alongside.
Right standard rudder.

Channel is open,Captain.
This is the Starship Enterprise.
Captain James T. Kirk commanding.
This is Kronos One.
I am Chancellor Gorkon.
We've been ordered to escort you to your meeting on Earth.
Thank you.
Would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard the Enterprise as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We would be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 19:30 hours.
I shall look forward to that.
I hope you're happy.
Captain!
There is a supply of Romulan ale aboard.
It might make the evening pass more¡­ smoothly.
Officer thinking,Lieutenant.
Guess who's coming to dinner.
Energize.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- Captain Kirk.
May I present Captain Spock, whom I believe you know.
Captain,face to face at last.
You have my thanks.
Chancellor.
Gentlemen.
This is my daughter,Azetbur¡­
My military advisor,Brigadier Kerla¡­
¡­and this is General Chang, my chief of staff.
I have so wanted to meet you,Captain.
- I'm not sure how to take that.
- Sincere admiration,Kirk.
From one warrior to another.
Right¡­
This way.
You might enjoy a brief tour.
- They all look alike.
- What about that smell?
You know only top of the line models can even talk¡­
- You men have work?
- Yes,ma'am.
Then snap to it.
I offer a toast.
The undiscovered country.
- The future.
- The undiscovered country.
Hamlet,act 3,scene 1.
You have not experienced Shake- speare until you've read him in Klingon.
Captain Kirk.
I thought Romulan ale was illegal.
An advantage of being 1,000 light years from Federation headquarters.
To you,Chancellor Gorkon.
One of the architects of our future.
Chancellor!
Perhaps we are looking at something of that future here.
Tell me,Captain Kirk.
Would you be willing to give up Starfleet?
The Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace.
I wouldn't dispute my first officer.
Starfleet has always been¡­
There's no need to mince words.
In space,all warriors are cold warriors.
General, are you fond of¡­ Shakespeare?
We believe all planets have a sovereign claim to inalienable human rights.
¡°Inalien¡­¡± If you could only hear yourselves.
¡°Human rights.¡± Why,the very name is racist.
The Federation is a ¡°homo sapiens only¡± club.
Present company excepted,of course.
We know where this is leading - the annihilation of our culture.
That's not true.
No!
¡°To be or not to be¡±¡­That is the question which preoccupies our people.
- We need breathing room.
- Earth.
Hitler,1938.
I beg your pardon?
Well¡­
I see we have a long way to go.
We must do this again sometime.
You don't trust me,do you?
I don't blame you.
If there is to be a brave new world, our generation is going to have the hardest time living in it.
- Captain Spock.
- Chancellor.
Madam.
Captain.
Well,most kind.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
Hmm,Captain?
¡°Have we not heard the chimes at midnight?
¡±
Thank God!
- Did you see the way they ate?
- Terrible table manners.
I doubt our own behaviour will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy.
I'm going to sleep this off.
Is there any other way we can screw up tonight?
I'm going to go find a pot of black coffee.
The Enterprise hosted Chancellor Gorkon to dinner last night.
Our manners weren't exactly Emily Post.
To the galley
- Romulan ale no longer to be served at diplomatic functions.
Captain Kirk,will you please join me on the bridge?
Captain Kirk?
- Captain.
- What is it?
- I find this curious.
- Spock,I'm really tired.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
- Where?
- It appears to emanate from us.
The Enterprise?
Val'eris,do you know anything about a radiation surge?
Chekov?
Only the size of my head.
I know what you mean.
- What's happened?
- We've fired on the Chancellor's ship.
Torpedo room!
Please confirm,have we fired?
- Uhura,monitor.
- Aye,sir.
- Direct hit.
- Confirmed,sir.
This is the bridge.
Do you read me?
- Did we fire those torpedoes?
- Negative.
We're still fully loaded.
Unable to confirm or deny firing the torpedoes.
- Hailing frequencies.
- Aye,sir.
Kronos One,this is Enterprise.
Do you read?
It's very hard to make out.
There's been weapons firing and a lot of shouting.
- She's still listing.
- She's spinning out of control.
Have you not a shred of decency in you,Kirk?
We come in peace, and you blatantly defy that peace.
For that, I shall blow you out of the stars.
- We haven't fired.
- Captain¡­
According to our data banks, we have.
Twice¡­
Captain,they're coming about.
- They're preparing to fire.
- Shields up,Captain?
- Captain,our shields.
- Shields up,Captain?
Signal our surrender.
We surrender!
- This is Enterprise.
We surrender.
- If they fire,with our shields down¡­
¡­we will not be able to respond.
- Repeat,Enterprise surrenders.
- Are we firing torpedoes?
- I wish I knew.
- I'm going aboard.
Spock,take the con.
- I involved you,I will go.
No,I'll go.
We'll not be the instigators of war on the eve of universal peace.
I'm going too,they may need a doctor.
Uhura,tell them we're coming, and tell them we're unarmed.
- Have you lost your mind?
!
- I don't understand what's happened.
We're here to help.
Follow me.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- My God!
What has happened here?
- You dare to feign ignorance?
- What happened?
With a direct torpedo hit, you crippled our gravitational field and two of your Starfleet crew beamed aboard wearing magnetic boots.
- Aren't you carrying a surgeon?
- We were until this disgrace.
Then for God's sake,let me help.
I've got a pulse - we can move him.
I need light.
Put him on the table.
Hold him!
Hold him while I stabilize him.
I said hold him!
Sweet Jesus.
- Can you¡­?
- I don't even know his anatomy.
- His wounds are not closing.
- He's killing him!
He's gone into some kind of damned arrest.
Come on,dammit!
Come on!
He's not responding.
Don't let it end this way,Captain.
Under article 184 of your Interstellar Law¡­
¡­I'm placing you under arrest.
You're charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
He tried to save him.
They've been arrested.
Mr Spock,we've got to do something.
I assume command of this ship as of 02:30 hours.
Commander Uhura,notify Starfleet headquarters and request instructions.
We cannot allow them to be taken to Kronos as prisoners.
Opening fire will not retrieve them, and we must avoid an armed conflict.
We will be able to follow the Captain's movements.
- How did you achieve this?
- Time is precious.
We must piece together what happened here tonight.
According to our data bank, this ship fired those torpedoes.
- No way!
- I sympathize,but we need evidence.
Please accompany me.
And if we cannot piece together what happened?
What then,sir?
In that case,Mr Chekov,it resides in the purview of the diplomats.
The Chancellor of the High Council is dead!
The result of an unprovoked attack while he travelled to see you under a flag of truce on a mission of peace!
Captain Kirk was legally arrested for the crime.
He and Dr. McCoy boarded Kronos One of their own free will.
- None of these facts are in dispute.
- I have ordered an investigation.
- In the meantime¡­
- In the meantime¡­
¡­we expect the Federation to abide by the articles of Interstellar Law.
Kirk and Dr. McCoy will stand trial for the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon.
Out of the question.
Ambassador Sarek,can we get them extradited?
Mr President,I share a measure of personal responsibility in this matter, but I am obliged to confirm my esteemed colleagues legal interpretation.
What is the position of the Romulan government?
I must concur with my colleagues.
You can't believe that Kirk assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council.
Mr President.
I don't know what to believe.
I'm waiting for your answer,sir.
This President is not above the law.
- We're to report back at once.
- We can't abandon Kirk and McCoy.
400 years ago,on Earth,workers who felt their livelihood threatened flung their wooden shoes called ¡°sabots¡± into the machines to stop them.
Hence the word ¡°sabotage¡±.
We experience technical malfunction.
All back-up systems inoperative.
Excellent.
I mean¡­ too bad.
Mr President,I have been named chancellor in my father's place.
Madam Chancellor, you have my condolences on your loss.
I assure you that this shameful deed will not¡­
Let us come to the point.
You want this conference to go forward.
I will attend in one week, on one condition.
We will not extradite the prisoners, and you will not attempt to rescue them.
We would consider any such attempt an act of war.
We hope you'll be our guest here on Earth.
After recent events,you will understand if I prefer a neutral site.
And in the interests of security,let us keep the location secret for now.
As you wish,Madam Chancellor.
Your father was killed for what he wanted.
The peace process will go forward.
Kirk¡­
Kirk will pay for my father's death.
It's a damn show trial.
The Enterprise fired on Kronos One without provocation.
The Chancellor and his advisors¡­
¡­having been lulled into a false sense of security by an invitation to a dinner aboard Captain Kirk's vessel at precisely 19:30 hours that same evening.
Call your first witness.
After the first shot we lost our gravitational field.
I was weightless and couldn't function.
Then two Starfleet crewmen came towards me.
Or perhaps they merely wore Starfleet uniforms.
That remark is speculative.
I move that it be stricken.
We're interested in facts,not theories.
If the gravitational unit was not functioning,how could they walk?
They appeared to be wearing magnetic boots.
- Gravity boots¡­?
- Dr. McCoy.
Would you be so good as to tell me what is your current medical status?
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
You have a singular wit,Doctor.
For 27 years I've been surgeon aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.
In three months I stand down.
You know¡­
I believe that you consumed rather a generous amount of Romulan ale in the officers mess on the night in question.
- Objection.
- Sustained.
We all did.
All of us.
That doesn't mean¡­
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
Barely.
Now be careful,Doctor.
Have you ever in your past saved patients as barely alive as he?
I didn't have the medical knowledge I needed for Klingon anatomy.
- I see.
- You where there.
You say you are due for retirement.
May I ask,do your hands shake?
- Objection!
- I was nervous.
No.
You were incompetent.
You were incompetent!
Whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink.
- The court will have to determine.
- My God,man.
I tried to save him!
I tried to save him.
I was desperate to save him.
He was the last best hope in the Universe for peace.
The witness is excused.
There we have it,citizens.
We have established the particulars of the crime.
And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair.
James Tiberius Kirk.
What would your favourite author say, Captain?
¡°Let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings.¡±
Tell us your sad story,Kirk.
Tell us that you planned to take revenge for the death of your son.
- That's not true.
- Objection!
Captain Kirk has not been identified as the assassin.
I offer into the record this excerpt from the Captain's personal log.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I've never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I've never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Are those your words?
Those words were spoken by me.
Objection!
My client's political views are not on trial.
On the contrary.
Captain Kirk's views are at the very heart of the matter.
His record shows him to be an insubordinate,unprincipled opportunist with a history of violating the chain of command whenever it suited him.
Continue.
The record shows that Captain Kirk once held the rank of Admiral and he was broken for taking matters into his own hands.
Do you deny being demoted for these charges.
Answer me now!
- I cannot deny it.
- You were demoted?
- For insubordination?
- On occasion,I have disobeyed orders.
Were you obeying or disobeying orders when you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?
I didn't know about it until we boarded the ship.
You still deny the Enterprise fired on Kronos One?
And you still deny your men beamed aboard and shot the Chancellor?
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I didn't witness.
Are you aware that as the captain of a ship, you are responsible for the actions of your men?
I am.
If it's proved that members of your crew carried out the assassination¡­
- They're setting us up.
Your Honours!
- Do not answer.
Captain Kirk, you will answer the question.
As Captain¡­
¡­I'm responsible for the crew under my command.
Your Honours,the state rests.
Send to Commander Enterprise.
¡°We stand ready to assist you.
Captain Sulu,U.S.S. Excelsior.¡±
It is the determination of this court that the prisoners are guilty as charged.
I wish to note for the record that all the evidence is circumstantial.
I beg the court to consider this when pronouncing its sentence.
So noted.
Captain James T. Kirk, Dr. Leonard McCoy.
In the interest of fostering amity for the forthcoming peace talks, the sentence of death is commuted.
It is the judgement of this court that,without possibility of reprieve or parole, you be taken from this place to the dilithium mines on the penal asteroid of Rura Penthe.
There to spend the rest of your natural lives.
Rura Penthe!
Known throughout the galaxy as the alien's graveyard.
Better to kill them now and get it over with.
Lieutenant.
The torpedo hit once again,please.
Hold.
It is Enterprise.
We fired.
That is not possible!
All weapons visually accounted for,sir.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains must be the truth.
What does that mean?
That if we cannot have fired those torpedoes,someone else did.
They didn't fire on themselves and there are no other ships present.
- There was a neutron surge.
- Not from us.
A neutron surge that big could only be produced by another ship.
- Kronos One?
- Too far away.
Very near us.
Possibly beneath us.
If there were a ship beneath us, the Klingons would have seen it.
Would they?
- A Bird of Prey?
- A Bird of Prey.
- Cloaked?
- They can't fire when they're cloaked.
All things being equal,I would agree.
However,things are not equal.
This one can.
- We must inform Starfleet Command.
- Of what?
A new weapon that's invisible?
They'll call us raving lunatics.
They'll say we'll say anything to exonerate the Captain.
And they would be correct.
We have no evidence.
Only a theory which happens to fit the facts.
Assuming you're right.
Why would they fire on their own President?
Indeed.
This ship will be searched from bow to stern.
I do not understand.
If there was a ship underneath us surely the assassins beamed aboard from that vessel,not Enterprise.
You're forgetting something, Mr Chekov.
According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
If we did,the killers are here.
If we did not, whoever altered the data banks is here.
In either case, what we are looking for is here.
- What are we looking for,sir?
- Lieutenant.
Two pairs of gravity boots.
This is the gulag Rura Penthe.
There is no stockades,no guard tower,no electronic frontier.
Only a magnetic shield prevents beaming.
Punishment means exile from prison to the surface.
On the surface,nothing can survive.
Work well,and you will be treated well.
Work badly,and you will die.
Oh,my God!
The universal translator has been confiscated.
I'm sorry¡­?
He's definitely on about something,Jim.
If this is your spot,we'll move on.
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
- He's got it.
- And your coat.
I'm afraid not.
It wouldn't fit.
- Thanks.
- This will help keep you warm.
- I'm Martia.
You're Kirk and McCoy.
- How did you know that?
We don't get many presidential assassins.
- We didn't kill Gorkon.
- Of course not.
- But there's a reward for your death.
- That figures.
We've been set up.
Somebody up there wants you out of the way.
- Any progress?
- None.
A crew of 300 are looking everywhere,but the killers may still be among them.
Surely they have disposed of these boots by now.
Would it not have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
Logic must give way to physics.
Gravity wasn't restored when they escaped.
Without the boots,they would have floated off the transporter pads.
Why not simply vaporize them?
Like this?
As you know,no one can fire an unauthorized phaser aboard a starship.
Suppose,when they returned,they threw the boots into the refuse.
I'm having the refuse searched.
If I'm correct,those boots will cling to the killer's necks like Tiberian bats.
They couldn't escape without them nor throw them out the window.
Those boots are here.
Somewhere.
- Did someone fire off a phaser?
- It's alright.
It's nothing.
Mr Spock,Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
- Who fired the¡­
- Ah,Mr Scott.
I hear you have difficulty with the warp drive.
How long do you need for repair?
There's nothing wrong with the bloody thing.
If we return to space dock,the killers can dispose of their footwear and we will never see the Captain or Dr. McCoy alive again.
- It could take weeks.
- Thank you.
Val'eris,inform Starfleet our warp drive is inoperative.
- A lie?
- An error.
We have lost all contact with the Captain and Dr. McCoy.
Yes,at the moment they're surrounded by a magnetic shield.
But if I know the Captain,he is deep into planning his escape.
You've got him where you want him,Jim!
- Are you alright?
- I think so.
- They'll respect you now.
- I was lucky that thing had knees.
That was not his knee.
Not everybody keep their genitals in the same place,Captain.
Anything you want to tell me?
See what you can do for him.
Let him know we're not holding a grudge.
Suppose he's holding a grudge?
When whoever it is makes their move,you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
- Do you want to get out of here?
- There's got to be a way.
Three months before retirement.
What a way to finish.
- We're not finished.
- Speak for yourself.
One day,one night¡­ Kobayashi Maru!
Bones!
Are you afraid of the future?
I believe that was the general idea that I was trying to convey.
- I don't mean this future.
- What is this - multiple choice?
Some people are afraid¡­ of what might happen.
- I was terrified.
- What terrified you,specifically?
No more Neutral Zone.
I was used to hating Klingons.
It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word.
- Spock was right.
- We all felt exactly the same.
No.
Somebody felt a lot worse.
I'm beginning to understand why.
If you've got any bright ideas,now is the time.
Time is the problem.
You and I are nothing.
You heard the judge - the peace conference is on again.
Whoever killed Gorkon is bound to attempt another assassination.
Unless we can get out of here.
It's me
- Martia.
Listen.
No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
- Except us.
- It is possible.
I know how to get outside the shield.
- How do we fit in?
- Getting outside the shield is easy.
After that,you have to get us off the surface before we freeze.
Can you?
- It's possible.
- I can't make it alone.
You're the likeliest candidate to come here for months.
Candidate for what?
Go to lift 7 in the morning for mining duty.
I'll see you there.
Don't disappoint me.
- What is it with you,anyway?
- Still think we're finished?
More than ever.
Sorry to wake you,sir.
Starfleet requests any data we have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
What?
They're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to space dock,sir.
Signal Starfleet that we have no idea location Enterprise.
- Sir?
- You have hearing problems?
No,sir.
Klingon blood.
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
This is the first evidence which corroborates our theory.
Now we go to Starfleet?
We expand our search to include uniforms.
All uniforms?
Clear,sir.
Make a hole.
Coming through.
Coming through.
Sir!
Sir!
- I think we've been had.
- No,you weren't,Doctor.
Get off at the first level.
Follow the gang into the mine.
They don't take girls.
- You are crewman Dax?
- Yes.
What is the problem?
Perhaps you know the Russian epic of Cinderella?
If shoe fits - wear it.
Mr Chekov¡­
Watch me.
What kind of creature is this?
Last night you two were¡­
Get in.
Come on.
We don't have a lot of time.
Hurry!
Up there.
Come on - climb!
Here,you'll need these.
Quickly!
Stay close.
- There they are.
- They emerge from the beaming shield.
Mr Scott,start your engines.
Mr Chekov,set course for Rura Penthe.
Mr Spock,Rura Penthe is deep inside the Klingon frontier.
- If we're discovered¡­
- Correct.
We need a feat of linguistic legerdemain and intrepidity before the Captain and Dr. McCoy freeze to death.
- Leave me,I'm finished.
- No!
Bones,I'm wearing a viridium patch on my back.
Spock slapped it there before we went on Gorkon's ship.
That cunning little Vulcan.
Come on!
We're in the clear.
Now that we're outside the shield,they can locate us two sectors away.
If they're even looking for us.
We must respond.
A universal translator would be recognised.
¡°What is your destination,over?
¡±
Would you mind explaining that little trick you do?
- I'm a Chameloid.
- I've heard about you.
Shape-shifters.
I thought you were mythical.
Give a girl a chance,Captain.
It takes a lot of effort.
I don't doubt it.
Stop me if I'm wrong, but do we have any way of knowing whether this is the real you?
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.
We're outside the shield.
Now it's your turn,Captain.
If you say so.
Are you crazy?
!
She didn't need our help.
Where did you get these convenient clothes?
Don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue.
It's to let them know where we are.
Ask her what she's getting in return.
A full pardon¡­ which doesn't cover this.
An accident wasn't good enough.
Come on,Spock.
Good enough for one.
Two would have looked suspicious.
Killed while attempting escape.
That's convincing for both.
Surprise!
- Your friends are late.
- They'll be along.
- I can't believe I kissed you.
- Must have been your lifelong ambition.
Isn't it time you became something else?
I like it here.
Well,well,well¡­
What took you so long?
Kill him,he's the one.
Not me,you idiot - him!
- No witnesses.
- Killed while trying to escape.
- Damned clever,if you ask me.
- It's a classic.
- That's what he wanted.
- Who?
Who wanted us killed?
Since you're all going to die anyway,why not tell you?
His name is¡­
Damn it!
What the hell!
Son of a¡­!
Couldn't you have waited two seconds?
He was about to explain the whole thing.
- You want to go back?
- Absolutely not!
This is the bridge.
We're still in Klingon space.
Deck 9,remain at battle stations.
Deck 9,remain at battle stations.
The Klingons have a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked.
- She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
- So that's it.
We believe that Gorkon's murderers are aboard this ship.
- Has the peace conference begun?
- Who knows?
The location is secret.
- There's always something.
- Captain!
Mr Spock!
I found the uniforms with the Klingon blood on them.
But the uniforms belong to these two men.
Burke and Samno.
Not anymore.
Phaser on ¡°stun¡± at close range.
First rule of assassination - kill the assassins.
- Now we're back to square one.
- Can I talk to you?
- Why weren't they vaporized?
- It would set off the alarm.
It's possible.
Now hear this.
Now hear this.
Court reporter to sick bay.
Code blue - urgent.
Statements to be taken at once from Yeomen Burke and Samno.
Repeat,court reporter to sick bay.
Code blue - urgent.
Statements to be taken.
Repeat,statements to be taken from Yeomen Burke and Samno.
You have to shoot.
If you are logical,you have to shoot.
- I do not want to.
- What you want is irrelevant.
What you've chosen is at hand.
I'd just as soon you didn't.
The operation is over.
I did not fire.
You cannot prove anything.
Yes,I can.
At my trial my personal log was used against me.
How long did you wait outside my quarters before I noticed you?
You knew?
I tried to tell you,but you would not listen.
Neither of us was hearing very well that night.
There were things I tried to tell you,about having faith.
You have betrayed the Federation.
All of you.
- And what have you've been doing?
- Saving Starfleet.
Klingons cannot be trusted.
Sir¡­ You said so yourself.
They killed your son.
Did you not wish Gorkon dead?
¡°Let them die¡±,you said.
Did I misinterpret you?
And you were right.
They conspired with us to assassinate their own Chancellor.
How trustworthy can they be?
Klingons and Federation members conspiring together.
- Who is ¡°us¡±?
- All who stands to lose from peace.
Names,Lieutenant.
My comrades will make certain all your transmissions are jammed.
- Names,Lieutenant!
- I do not remember.
A lie?
A choice.
Spock.
Admiral Cartwright.
From Starfleet?
Who else?
General¡­ Chang.
- Who else?
- Romulan Ambassador and others.
Where is the peace conference?
Where is the peace conference?
She does not know.
Then we're dead.
I have been dead before.
Contact Excelsior.
- She'll have the co-ordinates.
- I've already got it,sir.
- Standing by,Captain Kirk.
- Sulu.
You realize that by even talking to us,you're violating regulations.
I'm sorry,Captain.
Your message is breaking up.
Bless you,Sulu.
Where is the peace conference?
They'll attempt another assassination.
It's at Camp Khitomer,near the Romulan border.
I'm sending the co-ordinates on a coded frequency.
We'll need more than that.
There's a Bird of Prey on the look-out for us that can fire while cloaked.
Surely not.
How many of those things are there?
Come on,Lieutenant.
- Just the prototype.
- Do you hear that?
I'm getting under way now.
We're in Alpha Quadrant.
The chances of our reaching the conference in time are slim.
- When does this conference start?
- According to my information - today.
- Thank you,Captain Sulu.
- Don't mention it,Captain Kirk.
Spock?
I prefer it dark.
- Dining on ashes?
- You were right.
It was arrogant presumption on my part that got us into this situation.
You and the Doctor might have been killed.
The night is young.
You said it yourself,it was logical.
Peace is worth a few personal risks.
You're a great one for logic.
I'm a great one for rushing in where angels fear to tread.
We're both extremists.
Reality is probably somewhere in between.
I couldn't get past the death of my son.
I was prejudiced by her accomplishments as a Vulcan.
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was.
Is it possible¡­
¡­that we two,you and I,have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?
Would that constitute a joke?
- It wasn't your fault.
- I was responsible.
- For no actions but your own.
- That's not what you said at your trial.
That was as captain of the ship.
Human beings¡­
We both know that I am not human.
Do you want to know something?
Everybody's human.
I find that remark¡­ insulting.
Come,I need you.
Madam Chancellor,members of the diplomatic corps¡­
¡­honoured guests.
The United Federation of Planets welcomes you to Camp Khitomer.
She's out here somewhere.
- But if she's cloaked¡­
- Then all we have is a radiation surge.
By the time we're close enough to record it,we're ashes.
2.06¡­
2.03¡­
- Close enough to beam down?
- Not yet.
In two minutes. 1.58.
Go to impulse power for Khitomer.
Let us redefine progress to mean that just because we can do a thing it does not necessarily follow that we must do that thing.
- Uhura?
- Nothing,Captain.
If she's here,she's rigged for silent running.
Coming up on transporter range in 57 seconds.
Transporter room.
Stand by to beam down.
53¡­
48 seconds.
44¡­
I can see you,Kirk.
Chang.
Can you see me?
Now be honest,Captain.
Warrior to warrior.
You do prefer it this way,don't you?
As it was meant to be.
No peace in our time.
¡°Once more unto the breach,dear friends.¡±
- This is fun.
- Reverse engines.
All astern.
One and a half impulse power.
Back off!
What's she waiting for?
Probably attempting to ascertain why we are reversing.
Wondering whether we detect her.
Incoming!
- In range?
- Not yet,sir.
Come on!
- She'll fly apart.
- Fly her apart,then!
Many speculated about my father's motives.
Some said he was an idealist.
Others said he had no choice.
If Praxis had not exploded,his idealism wouldn't have found expression.
We are a proud race.
We are here because we intend to go on being proud.
- Go to auxiliary power!
- Auxiliary circuits destroyed.
¡°Tickle us,do we not laugh?
Prick us,do we not bleed?
¡±
¡°Wrong us,shall we not revenge?
¡±
Gas.
Gas,Captain.
Under impulse power she expands fuel,like all vessels.
We call it ¡°plasma¡±,but it is merely ionised gas.
What about our equipment to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
The thing's got to have a tail-pipe.
Doctor,would you assist me in performing surgery on a torpedo?
Fascinating.
Hard to starboard.
The proposed agenda is as follows:
The evacuation of Kronos has been calculated within the 50 Earth year time span.
Phase 1 - preparation for evacuation¡­
Captain,she's packing quite a wallop.
Shields weakening.
Shields up!
Alright,now we're giving them something else to shoot at.
The game's afoot.
- Excelsior's been hit!
- ¡°Our revels now are ended¡±,Kirk.
¡°Cry havoc,and let slip the dogs of war.¡±
- Bones,where's my torpedo?
- Bet you wished you'd stayed in bed.
Shields collapsing!
The key,please.
Time is short.
- The hull has been compromised.
- I wonder how bad.
Connect echo-bars.
¡­discuss the report on phase 2.
- Alter circuit A.
- Sensor.
¡­we commence within minutes of the preparation.
- ¡°I am constant as the Northern star.¡±
- I'd give real money,if he'd shut up.
Plate,please.
¡­and assimilation will consume¡­
We've got a heart beat.
¡­with the Klingon Empire¡­
Key,please.
- Where's that torpedo?
- She's ready.
Lock and load!
Fire!
¡°To be¡­ or not¡±¡­
¡­¡°to be.¡±
Target that explosion and fire.
Fire!
This work will occupy us throughout most of the week.
I hope that the delegation can implement the provisions of Phase 1 by the first of next month.
As you know,time is of the essence.
Out of the way!
Mr President!
Mr President!
Kirk,Enterprise.
- Arrest those men!
- Arrest yourself!
We've got a full confession.
- This is not Klingon blood.
- Cartwright.
Just a minute.
What's happened?
What's the mean of all of this?
It's about the future,Madam Chancellor.
Some people think the future means the end of history.
We haven't run out of history quite yet.
Your father called the future¡­
¡­¡°the undiscovered country¡±.
People can be very frightened of change.
You've restored my father's faith.
And you've restored my son's.
Once again,we've saved civilization as we know it.
And they're not going to prosecute.
They could have prosecuted me.
I felt like Val'eris.
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
And it's a good thing,too.
If they did,we'd all have to turn ourselves in.
- Captain Kirk.
- Captain Sulu.
As much to the crew of the Enterprise,I owe you my thanks.
Nice to see you in action one more time,Captain Kirk.
Take care.
- My God,that's a big ship.
- Not so big as her captain.
So¡­ This is goodbye?
It's about time we got underway ourselves.
Captain,I have orders from Starfleet Command.
We're to put back to space dock immediately¡­ to be decommissioned.
If I were human,I believe my response would be:
¡°Go to hell.¡±
If I were human.
Course heading,Captain?
Second star to the right.
And straight on 'til morning.
Captain's log,stardate 9529.1.
This is the final cruise of the Starship Enterprise under my command.
This ship,and her history will shortly become the care of another crew.
To them and their posterity will we commit our future.
They'll continue the voyages we have begun and journey to all the undiscovered countries boldly going where no man,where no one¡­
¡­has gone before.
Stardate 9521.6.
Captain's Log, U.S.S. Excelsior.
Hikaru Sulu commanding.
After three years,
I've concluded my first assignment as master of this vessel, cataloguing gaseous planetary anomalies in Beta Quadrant.
We're heading home under full impulse power.
I am pleased to report that ship and crew have functioned well.
According to this, we've completed our survey of the entire sector.
I have an energy wave at 240 degrees mark 6 port, sir.
Visual.
My God.
Shields.
Shields!
She's not answering her helm.
Starboard thruster.
Turn her into the wave.
Aye.
Quarter impulse power.
Damage report.
Checking all systems, Captain.
Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
Negative, sir.
The subspace shockwave originated at bearing 3-2-3 mark 75.
Location...
It's Praxis, sir.
It's a Klingon moon.
Praxis is their key energy production facility.
Send to Klingon High Command.
This is Excelsior, a Federation starship.
We have monitored a large explosion in your sector.
Do you require assistance?
Aye, sir.
Mr. Valtane, any more data?
Yes, sir.
I've confirmed the location of Praxis, but...
What is it?
I cannot confirm the existence of Praxis.
Onscreen.
Magnify.
Computer enhancement.
Praxis?
What's left of it, sir.
Captain, I'm getting a message from Praxis.
Let's have it.
This is Brigadier Kerla speaking for the High Command.
There has been an incident on Praxis.
However, everything is under control.
We have no need for assistance.
Obey treaty stipulations and remain outside the neutral zone.
This transmission ends now.
An incident?
Do we report this, sir?
Are you kidding?
What are we doing here?
Maybe they're throwing us a retirement party.
That suits me.
I just bought a boat.
This had better be good.
I'm supposed to be chairing a seminar at the Academy.
Captain, isn't this just for top brass?
If we're all here, where's Sulu?
Captain Sulu.
On assignment.
Where's Spock?
This briefing is classified.
Ladies and gentlemen, the CinC.
As you were.
To break this information down succinctly, the Klingon Empire has roughly 50 years of life left to it.
For full details, I'm turning this briefing over to the Federation's special envoy.
Good morning.
Two months ago, a Federation starship monitored an explosion on the Klingon moon Praxis.
We believe it was caused by over-mining and insufficient safety precautions.
The moon's decimation means the deadly pollution of their ozone.
They will have depleted their supply of oxygen in approximately 50 Earth years.
Due to their enormous military budget, the Klingon economy does not have the resources with which to combat this catastrophe.
Last month, at the behest of the Vulcan ambassador,
I opened a dialogue with Gorkon,
Chancellor of the Klingon High Council.
He proposes to commence negotiations at once.
Negotiations for what?
The dismantling of our space stations and starbases along the neutral zone, an end to almost 70 years of unremitting hostility, which the Klingons can no longer afford.
Bill, are we talking about mothballing the Starfleet?
Well, I'm sure that our exploration and scientific programs would be unaffected, Captain, but...
I must protest.
To offer Klingons safe haven within Federation space is suicide.
Klingons would become the alien trash of the galaxy, and if we dismantle the fleet, we'd be defenseless before an aggressive species with a foothold on our territory.
The opportunity here is to bring them to their knees.
Then we'll be in a far better position to dictate terms.
Sir?
Captain Kirk.
The Klingons have never been trustworthy.
I'm forced to agree with Admiral Cartwright.
This is a terrifying idea.
It is imperative that we act now to support the Gorkon initiative lest more conservative elements persuade his empire that it is better to attempt a military solution and die fighting.
You, Captain Kirk, are to be our first olive branch.
We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon vessel which is bringing Chancellor Gorkon to Earth and to escort him safely through Federation space.
Me?
Well, there are Klingons who feel the same way about the peace treaty as yourself and Admiral Cartwright, but they'll think twice about attacking the Enterprise under your command.
I have personally vouched for you in this matter, Captain.
You have personally vouched?
You will extend Chancellor Gorkon full diplomatic courtesy, Captain Kirk.
But a full ambassador would be better equipped...
If there's no further business,
I wish you and your crew Godspeed.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
I remind you, this meeting is classified.
I don't know whether to congratulate you or not, Jim.
I wouldn't.
We volunteered?
There is an old Vulcan proverb.
Only Nixon could go to China.
How could you vouch for me?
That's arrogant presumption.
My father requested that I open negotiations...
I know your father's the Vulcan ambassador, for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this.
They're animals.
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here.
Don't believe them.
Don't trust them.
They are dying.
Let them die.
Has it occurred to you, that this crew is due to stand down in three months?
We've done our bit for king and country.
You should have trusted me.
Control, this is SD-103, approach to spacedock.
Over.
SD-103, you are clear to deliver Captain Kirk and party to NCC-1701 Alpha.
Over.
Captain on the Bridge.
As you were, Lieutenant...
Valeris, sir.
We were told that you needed a helmsman, so I volunteered.
Lieutenant, it is agreeable to see you again.
Lieutenant was the first Vulcan to be graduated at the top of her class at the academy.
You must be very proud.
I don't believe so, sir.
She's a Vulcan, all right.
Let's get this over with.
Departure stations.
Scotty.
Aye, sir?
Did you find the engine room?
Right where I left it, sir.
Standby.
Uhura, get me the dockmaster.
Control tower reading, sir.
Control, this is Enterprise, requesting permission to depart.
This is Control, Enterprise.
Permission to depart granted.
Thirty seconds for port gates.
Clear all moorings.
Awaiting port gates from this mark.
All moorings clear.
Aft thrusters.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
One-quarter impulse power.
Captain, may I remind you that regulations specify thrusters only while in spacedock?
Jim?
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
Aye, sir.
Captain's Log, Stardate 9522.6.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I could never forgive them for the death of my boy.
It seems to me our mission to escort the Chancellor of the Klingon High Council to a peace summit is problematic at best.
Spock says this could be an historic occasion, and I'd like to believe him, but how on earth can history get past people like me?
Sorry.
You could have knocked.
We are almost at the rendezvous, sir.
I thought that you would like to know.
Right.
Permission to speak freely, sir.
It is an honor to serve with you.
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant.
I've always wanted to try that, sir.
You've done well, Valeris.
As your sponsor at the academy,
I have followed your career with satisfaction, and as a Vulcan, you've exceeded my expectations.
I do not understand this representation.
It is a depiction from ancient Earth mythology, the expulsion from Paradise.
Why keep it in your quarters?
It is a reminder to me that all things end.
It is of endings that I wish to speak.
Sir, I address you as a kindred intellect.
Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
History is replete with turning points, Lieutenant.
You must have faith.
Faith?
That the universe will unfold as it should.
But is that logical?
Surely we must...
Logic, logic and logic.
Logic is the beginning of wisdom, Valeris, not the end.
This will be my final voyage on board this vessel as a member of her crew.
Nature abhors a vacuum.
I intend you to replace me.
I could only succeed you, sir.
Now hear this.
All officers to the Bridge.
Klingon battle cruiser off the port bow.
All officers to the Bridge.
Captain on the Bridge.
Shall we raise our shields, Captain?
Never been this close.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
Uhura, hailing frequencies.
Aye, sir.
Right standard rudder.
Bring us alongside.
Right standard rudder.
Z plus 5 degrees.
Channel is open, Captain.
This is the Starship Enterprise,
Captain James T. Kirk commanding.
This is Kronos One.
I am Chancellor Gorkon.
Chancellor, we've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting on Earth.
Thank you, Captain.
Would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard the Enterprise with my officers, as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We would be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
I shall look forward to that.
Well, I hope you're happy.
Captain, there is a supply of Romulan ale aboard.
It might make the evening pass more smoothly.
Officer thinking, Lieutenant.
Guess who's coming to dinner.
Energize.
Chancellor Gorkon.
Captain Kirk.
May I present Captain Spock, whom I believe you know.
Captain, face to face at last.
You have my thanks.
Chancellor.
Gentlemen, this is my daughter Azetbur,
my military adviser, Brigadier Kerla, and this is General Chang, my chief of staff.
I have so wanted to meet you, Captain.
I'm not sure how to take that.
Sincere admiration, Kirk.
From one warrior to another.
Right.
This way.
I think you might enjoy a brief tour.
They all look alike.
What about that smell?
You know only top-of-the-line models can even talk...
You men have work?
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
Then snap to it.
I offer a toast.
The undiscover'd country,
the future.
The undiscover'd country.
The undiscover'd country.
Hamlet, Act III, Scene 1.
You've not experienced Shakespeare until you have read him in the original Klingon.
Captain Kirk, I thought Romulan ale was illegal.
One of the advantages of being 1,000 light-years from Federation Headquarters.
To you, Chancellor Gorkon, one of the architects of our future.
Chancellor.
Chancellor.
Perhaps we are looking at something of that future here.
Tell me, Captain Kirk, would you be willing to give up Starfleet?
I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace.
Far be it for me to dispute my first officer, but Starfleet has always been at the fore...
Captain, there's no need to mince words.
In space, all warriors are cold warriors.
General, are you fond of
Shakespeare?
We do believe all planets have a sovereign claim to inalienable human rights.
Inalien?
If you could only hear yourselves.
Human rights.
Why, the very name is racist.
The Federation is no more than a Homo Sapiens Only club.
Present company excepted, of course.
In any case, we know where this is leading.
The annihilation of our culture.
That's not true.
No?
No.
To be, or not to be.
That is the question which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk.
We need breathing room.
Earth, Hitler, 1938.
I beg your pardon?
Well...
I see we have a long way to go.
We must do this again sometime.
You don't trust me, do you?
I don't blame you.
If there is to be a brave new world, our generation is going to have the hardest time living in it.
Captain Spock.
Chancellor.
Madam.
Captain.
Well, most kind.
Parting is such sweet sorrow, Captain.
Have we not heard the chimes at midnight?
Thank God.
Did you see the way they ate?
Terrible table manners.
I doubt that our own behavior will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy.
I'm going to sleep this off.
Please let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight.
I'm going to go find a pot of black coffee.
The Enterprise hosted Chancellor Gorkon and company to dinner last night.
Our manners weren't exactly,
Emily Post.
Note to the galley,
Romulan ale no longer to be served at diplomatic functions.
Captain Kirk, will you please join me on the Bridge?
Captain Kirk?
Captain.
What is it?
I find this curious.
Spock, I'm really tired.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
Where?
Strangely enough, it appears to be emanating from us.
The Enterprise?
Valeris, do you know anything about a radiation surge?
Sir?
Chekov?
Only the size of my head.
I know what you mean.
What's happened?
We have fired on the Chancellor's ship.
Torpedo Room, please confirm.
Have we fired?
0-6...
Uhura, monitor.
Aye, sir.
Direct hit.
Confirmed, sir.
We've lost gravity!
We are betrayed!
This is the Bridge.
Do you read?
Do you read?
Torpedo bay, did we fire those torpedoes?
Negative, Captain.
According to inventory, we're still fully loaded.
Find Chang.
Unable to confirm or deny firing of two photon torpedoes.
Hailing frequencies.
Aye, sir.
Kronos One, this is Enterprise.
Do you read?
Over.
Repeat.
Kronos One...
It's very hard to make out, Captain.
There's been some weapons firing and a lot of shouting.
She is still listing.
She's spinning out of control.
Restoring auxiliary gravity.
Have you not a shred of decency in you, Kirk?
We come in peace, and you blatantly defile that peace.
For that, I shall blow you out of the stars.
We haven't fired.
Captain.
According to our databanks, we have, twice.
Captain, they're coming about.
They're preparing to fire.
Shields up, Captain?
Captain, our shields.
Shields up, Captain?
Signal our surrender.
Captain?
We surrender!
This is Enterprise.
We surrender.
If they fire at us with our shields down...
I repeat.
We surrender.
we will not be able to respond.
Repeat.
Enterprise surrenders.
Are we firing torpedoes?
I wish I knew.
Well, it sure looks like it.
I'm going aboard.
Spock, you have the conn.
I am responsible for involving you in this.
I will go.
No, I'll go.
You'll be responsible for getting me out of this.
We'll not be the instigators of full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
I'm going, too.
They may need a doctor.
Perhaps you're right.
Uhura, tell them we're coming, and tell them we're unarmed.
Aye, sir.
Have you lost your mind?
I give you my word, I don't understand what has happened.
We're here to help.
Follow me.
Chancellor Gorkon.
My God.
What has happened here?
You dare to feign ignorance?
What happened?
With a direct torpedo hit, you crippled our entire gravitational field, and two of your Starfleet crew beamed aboard wearing magnetic boots and did this.
Aren't you carrying a surgeon?
We were until this disgrace.
Well, then for God sakes, man, let me help.
I've got a pulse.
We can move him.
I'm gonna need some light.
Can we get him up on this table?
Hold him.
Hold him while I stabilize him.
I said hold him.
Sweet Jesus.
Can you...
Jim, I don't even know his anatomy.
His wounds are not closing.
He's killing him!
He's gone into some kind of damned arrest.
Come on, damn it!
Come on!
He's not responding.
Don't let it end this way, Captain.
Under article number 184 of your interstellar law,
I'm placing you under arrest.
You are charged with assassinating, our Chancellor of the High Council.
He tried to save him.
They've been arrested.
Mr. Spock, we've got to do something.
I assume command of this ship as of 0230 hours.
Commander Uhura, please notify Starfleet Headquarters.
Tell them precisely what has taken place and request instructions.
Aye, sir.
We cannot allow them to be taken back to Kronos as prisoners.
What do you suggest, Lieutenant?
Opening fire will not retrieve them, and an armed conflict is precisely what the Captain wished to avoid.
We will be able to follow the Captain's movements.
How did you achieve this, sir?
Time is precious, Lieutenant.
We must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight.
According to our databank, this ship fired those torpedoes.
No way.
I sympathize Mr. Scott, but we need evidence.
Please accompany me.
And if we cannot piece together what happened?
What then, sir?
In that case, Mr. Chekov, it resides in the purview of the diplomats.
The Chancellor of the High Council is dead!
The result of an unprovoked attack while he travelled to see you under a flag of truce, on a mission of peace.
Captain Kirk was legally arrested for the crime.
May I remind you that he and Dr McCoy boarded Kronos One of their own free will?
None of these facts are in dispute, Mr. President.
I have ordered a full-scale investigation.
In the meantime...
In the meantime, we expect the Federation to abide by the articles of interstellar law, which you claim to cherish.
Kirk and Dr McCoy will stand trial for the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon.
Out of the question.
Ambassador Sarek, there must be some way to extradite these men.
Mr. President, I share a measure of personal responsibility in this matter, but I am obliged to confirm my esteemed colleague's legal interpretation.
What is the position of the Romulan government,
Ambassador Nanclus?
I must concur with my colleagues.
But you can't possibly believe that James Kirk assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council.
Mr. President, I don't know what to believe.
I'm waiting for your answer, sir.
This president is not above the law.
Report back at once.
Do you copy?
At once.
Enterprise to report back on the double.
Do you read?
At once.
We're to report back at once.
We cannot abandon Captain Kirk and Dr McCoy.
Of course not.
Four hundred years ago on the planet Earth, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by automation flung their wooden shoes called sabot into the machines to stop them.
Hence the word sabotage.
We are experiencing technical malfunction.
All backup systems inoperative.
Excellent.
I mean, too bad.
Mr. President,
I've been named Chancellor by the High Council in my father's place.
Madam Chancellor, you have my sincerest condolences on your recent loss.
I want to assure you that this shameful deed will not...
Mr. President, let us come to the point.
You want this conference to go forward, and so did my father.
I will attend in one week on one condition.
We will not extradite the prisoners, and you will make no attempt to rescue them in a military operation.
We would consider any such attempt an act of war.
We hope you'll be our guest here on Earth.
After recent events, you will understand if I say I prefer a neutral site, and in the interests of security, let us keep the location secret for now.
As you wish, Madam Chancellor.
Attack them now, while we still can!
Attack or be slaves in their world.
We can take whole by force, what they propose to divide.
War is obsolete, General, as we are in danger of becoming.
Better to die on our feet than live on our knees.
He can't be!
Your father was killed for what he wanted.
The peace process will go forward.
Kirk...
Kirk will pay for my father's death.
It's a damn show trial.
Kirk!
Kirk!
Kirk!
Kirk!
The Enterprise fired on Kronos One without provocation.
The Chancellor and his advisers... having been lulled into a false sense of security by an invitation to a state dinner aboard Captain Kirk's vessel at precisely 1930 hours that same evening.
Call your first witness.
After the first shot, we lost our gravitational field.
I found myself weightless and unable to function.
Then two Starfleet crewmen came walking towards me.
But perhaps they merely wore Starfleet uniforms.
That remark is purely speculative.
I move that it be stricken.
Colonel Worf, we are interested in facts, not theories.
If the gravitational unit was not functioning, how could these men be walking?
They appeared to be wearing magnetic boots.
Gravity boots.
Dr McCoy, would you be so good as to tell me, what is your current medical status?
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
You have a singular wit, Doctor.
For 27 years, I've been ship surgeon aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.
In three months, I stand down.
You know, I believe that you consumed a rather generous amount of Romulan ale in the officers' mess on the night in question.
Am I right, Doctor?
Objection!
Sustained.
We all did.
All of us.
That doesn't mean...
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
Barely.
Now be careful, Doctor.
Have you ever, in your past, saved patients as barely alive as he?
I didn't have the medical knowledge I needed for Klingon anatomy.
I see.
You were there.
You say you are due for retirement.
May I ask, do your hands shake?
Objection!
I was nervous.
No.
You were incompetent.
You were incompetent!
Whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink, the court will have to determine.
My God, man!
I tried to save him!
I tried to save him.
I was desperate to save him.
He was the last best hope in the universe for peace.
The witness is excused.
There we have it, citizens.
We have finally established the particulars of the crime, and now we come to the architect of this tragic affair,
James Tiberius Kirk.
What would your favorite author say, Captain?
Let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings.
Tell us your sad story, Kirk.
Tell us that you planned to take revenge for the death of your son.
That's not true.
Objection!
Captain Kirk has not been identified as the assassin.
Sustained.
I offer into the record, this excerpt from the Captain's personal log.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I have never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Again.
Again!
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I have never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Are those your words?
Those words were spoken by me.
Objection!
My client's political views are not on trial here.
On the contrary!
Captain Kirk's views and motives are indeed at the very heart of the matter.
This officer's record shows him to be an insubordinate, unprincipled, career-minded opportunist, with a history of violating the chain of command whenever it suited him!
Continue.
Indeed, the record shows that Captain Kirk once held the rank of Admiral, and that Admiral Kirk was broken for taking matters into his own hands in defiance of regulations of the law.
Do you deny being demoted for these charges?
Don't wait for the translation!
Answer me now!
I cannot deny it.
You were demoted?
Yes.
For insubordination?
On occasion, I have disobeyed orders.
And were you obeying or disobeying orders when you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?
I didn't know about the assassination until we boarded the ship.
You still deny the Enterprise fired on Kronos One?
Well...
Your Honors, please!
And you still deny your men beamed aboard and shot the Chancellor?
Objection!
I cannot confirm or deny actions I did not witness.
Captain Kirk, are you aware that as the captain of a starship, you are required to be responsible for the actions of your men?
I am.
And if it should be proved that members of your crew did, in fact, carry out such an assassination...
Jim, they're setting us up.
Your Honors...
Do not answer!
Captain Kirk, you will answer the question.
As captain,
I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
Your Honors, the State rests.
Send to Commander Enterprise.
We stand ready to assist you.
Captain Sulu, U.S.S. Excelsior.
It is the determination of this court that the prisoners are guilty as charged.
I wish to note for the record that the evidence against my clients is entirely circumstantial.
I beg the court to consider this when pronouncing its sentence.
So noted.
Captain James T. Kirk, Dr Leonard McCoy, in the interest of fostering amity for the forthcoming peace talks, the sentence of death is commuted.
It is the judgment of this court that, without possibility of reprieve or parole, you be taken from this place to the dilithium mines on the penal asteroid of Rura Penthe, there to spend the rest of your natural lives.
Rura Penthe?
Known throughout the galaxy as the aliens' graveyard.
Better to kill them now and get it over with.
Lieutenant, the torpedo hit once again, please.
Hold.
It is Enterprise.
We fired.
That is not possible.
All weapons visually accounted for, sir.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.
What exactly does that mean?
It means that if we cannot have fired those torpedoes, someone else did.
Well, they did not fire on themselves, and there were no other ships present.
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
Not from us!
A neutron surge that big could only be produced by another ship.
Kronos One?
Too far away.
Very near us.
Possibly beneath us.
If there were a ship beneath us, the Klingons would have seen her.
Would they?
A bird-of-prey.
A bird-of-prey.
Cloaked?
A bird-of-prey cannot fire when she's cloaked.
All things being equal, Mr. Scott, I would agree.
However, things are not equal.
This one can.
We must inform Starfleet Command.
Inform them of what, a new weapon that is invisible?
Raving lunatics, that's what they'll call us.
They'll say that we're so desperate to exonerate the Captain that we'll say anything.
And they would be correct.
We have no evidence, only a theory which happens to fit the facts.
Assuming you're right, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own president?
Indeed.
This ship will be searched from bow to stern.
Lieutenant Valeris, you'll be in charge.
Aye, sir.
I do not understand.
If there was a ship underneath us, surely the assassins beamed aboard from that vessel, not Enterprise.
You're forgetting something, Mr. Chekov.
According to our databanks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
If we did, the killers are here.
If we did not, whoever altered the databanks is here.
In either case, what we are looking for is here.
What are we looking for, sir?
Lieutenant?
Two pairs of gravity boots.
This is the gulag Rura Penthe.
There is no stockade, no guard tower, no electronic frontier.
Only a magnetic shield prevents beaming.
Punishment means exile from prison to the surface.
On the surface, nothing can survive.
Work well and you will be treated well.
Work badly and you will die.
Oh, my God.
The universal translator's been confiscated.
I'm sorry?
He's definitely on about something, Jim.
If this is your spot, we'll move on.
He wants your obedience to the brotherhood of aliens.
He's got it.
And your coat.
I'm afraid not.
Besides, it wouldn't fit.
Thanks.
This will help keep you warm.
I'm Martia.
You're Kirk and McCoy, I presume.
How'd you know that?
We don't get many presidential assassins.
We didn't kill Gorkon.
Of course not, but there is a reward for your death.
It figures.
We've been set up all along.
Somebody up there wants you out of the way.
Nothing in here.
Nothing here.
Any progress?
None.
We have a crew of 300 turning their own quarters inside out, but the killers may still be among them.
Surely they have disposed of these boots by now.
Would it not have been logical to have left them on Gorkon's ship?
Even logic must give way to physics.
Gravity had not been restored by the time they escaped.
Without the boots, they would have floated off the Klingon transporter pads.
Why not simply vaporize them?
Like this?
At ease.
As you know, Commander Chekov, no one can fire an unauthorized phaser aboard a starship.
Suppose when they returned, they threw the boots into the refuse.
I'm having the refuse searched.
If my surmise is correct, those boots will cling to the killers' necks like a pair of Tiberian bats.
They could not make their escape without them, nor can they simply throw them out the window for all to see.
Those boots are here somewhere.
Did someone fire off a phaser?
It's all right.
It's nothing.
It's nothing.
Mr. Spock, Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
Who fired that...
Mr. Scott.
I understand you're having difficulty with the warp drive.
How much time do you require for repair?
There's nothing wrong with the bloody thing.
Mr. Scott, if we return to spacedock, the assassins will surely find a way to dispose of their incriminating footwear, and we will never see the Captain or Dr McCoy alive again.
It could take weeks, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Scott.
Valeris, please inform Starfleet Command our warp drive is inoperative.
A lie?
An error.
You understand we have lost all contact with the Captain and Dr McCoy.
Yes.
At the moment, they're surrounded by a magnetic shield.
However, if I know the Captain, by this time, he is deep into planning his escape.
You got him, Jim!
You got him where you want him!
You all right, Jim?
I think so.
They'll respect you now.
That's a comfort.
I was lucky that thing had knees.
That was not his knee.
Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Anything you want to tell me?
Bones, why don't you see what you can do for him?
Let him know we're not holding a grudge.
Suppose he's holding a grudge?
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
Do you want to get out of here?
There's gotta be a way.
Three months before retirement.
What a way to finish.
We're not finished.
No?
Speak for yourself.
One day, one night, Kobayashi Maru.
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
I believe that was the general idea that I was trying to convey.
I don't mean this future.
What is this, multiple choice?
Some people are afraid of what might happen.
I was terrified.
What terrified you, specifically?
No more neutral zone.
I was used to hating Klingons.
It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word.
Spock was right.
Try not to be too hard on yourself.
We all felt exactly the same.
No.
Somebody felt a lot worse.
I'm beginning to understand why.
Well, if you've got any bright ideas, now's the time.
Time's the problem.
You and I are nothing.
But you heard the judge.
The peace conference is on again.
Whoever killed Gorkon is bound to attempt another assassination.
Unless we can get out of here.
Kirk, it's me, Martia.
Listen, no one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
Except us.
It is possible.
I know how to get outside the shield.
How do we fit in?
Getting outside the shield is easy, but after that, it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze.
Can you?
It's possible.
I can't make it alone, and you're likeliest candidate to come in this hellhole for months.
Candidate for what?
Go to lift seven in the morning for mining duty.
I'll see you there.
Don't disappoint me.
What is it with you, anyway?
Still think we're finished?
More than ever.
I'm sorry to wake you, sir.
What is it?
Starfleet urgently requests any data we have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
What?
Well apparently, they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
Signal Starfleet that, we have no idea location Enterprise.
Sir?
You have hearing problems, mister?
No, sir.
Klingon blood.
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
This is the first evidence which corroborates our theory.
Now we go to Starfleet.
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
All uniforms?
Take those out.
Continue scanning.
Nothing, sir.
Clear, sir.
Coming through.
Coming through.
Computer well seven clear.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Okay, let's see what we got.
Nothing.
Nothing so far.
Sir!
Sir!
I think we've been had.
No, you weren't, Doctor.
Get off at the first level.
Follow the gang into the mine.
They don't take girls.
You are Crewman Dax?
Yes, Commander.
What is the problem?
Perhaps you know Russian epic of Cinderella?
If shoe fits, wear it.
Mr. Chekov.
Watch me.
What kind of creature is this?
Last night, you two were...
Don't remind me.
Get in.
Come on.
We don't have a lot of time.
Hurry.
Up there.
Come on, climb.
Here.
You'll need these.
Quickly!
Stay close.
There they are.
They're emerging from the beaming shield.
Mr. Scott, start your engines.
Aye, aye, sir.
Mr. Chekov, set course for Rura Penthe.
Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe is deep inside the Klingon frontier.
If we are discovered...
Quite correct, Mr. Chekov.
What is required now is a feat of linguistic legerdemain and a degree of intrepidity before the Captain and Dr McCoy freeze to death.
Leave me.
I'm finished.
No!
Bones, I'm wearing a viridium patch on my back.
Spock slapped it there just before we went on Gorkon's ship.
Why, that cunning little Vulcan.
Come on.
We're in the clear.
Now that we're outside the shield, they'll be able to locate us two sectors away.
If they're even looking for us.
This is listening post Morska.
What ship is that?
What ship is that?
Over.
What ship is that?
Over.
We must respond personally.
A universal translator would be recognized.
What ship is that?
Over.
What ship is that?
Over.
We am thy freighter Ursva.
Six weeks out of
Kronos port.
Over.
What is your destination?
Over.
What is your destination?
Over
What is your destination?
Over.
What is your destination?
Over.
Rura Penthe.
We is condemning food,
things and supplies.
Don't catch any bugs!
Would you mind explaining that little trick you do?
I'm a chameloid.
I've heard about you.
Shapeshifters.
I thought you were mythical.
Give a girl a chance, Captain.
It takes a lot of effort.
I don't doubt it.
Stop me if I'm wrong, but do we have any way of knowing whether this is the real you?
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.
We're outside the shield.
Now it's your turn, Captain.
If you say so.
Are you crazy?
She didn't need our help getting anywhere.
Where'd you get these convenient clothes?
Don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue.
It's to let them know where we are.
Ask her what she's getting in return.
A full pardon, which doesn't cover this.
An accident wasn't good enough.
Come on, Spock.
Good enough for one.
Two would have looked suspicious.
Killed while attempting escape.
Now that's convincing for both.
Surprise!
Your friends are late.
They'll be along.
I can't believe I kissed you.
Must have been your lifelong ambition.
Isn't it about time you became something else?
I like it here.
Well, well, well.
What took you so long?
Kill him.
He's the one.
Not me, you idiot.
Him!
No witnesses.
Killed while trying to escape.
Damn clever, if you ask me.
It's a classic.
That's what he wanted.
Who?
Who wanted us killed?
Since you're all going to die anyway, why not tell you?
His name is...
Damn it to hell!
Of all the...
Son of a...
Couldn't you have waited two seconds?
Captain?
He was just about to explain the whole thing.
You want to go back?
Absolutely not!
It's cold.
This is the Bridge.
We are still in Klingon space.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
They were beamed aboard, a Federation starship.
Escaped.
Escaped.
Kirk cannot know the location of the peace conference.
Are you sure?
Will you take that chance?
Helmsman!
Sir.
Make course to intercept Enterprise.
Yes Sir.
The Klingons have a new weapon, a bird-of-prey that can fire when cloaked.
She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
So that's it.
Not entirely.
I have reason to believe that Gorkon's murderers are aboard this vessel.
I have a thought about that.
Has the peace conference begun?
Who knows?
They're keeping the location secret.
There's always something.
Captain!
Mr. Spock!
I found the missing uniforms with the Klingon blood on them.
But the uniforms belong to these two men,
Burke and Samno.
Not anymore.
Phaser on stun at close range.
First rule of assassination, kill the assassins.
Now we're back to square one.
Can I talk to you?
I wonder why they weren't vaporized.
It would set off the alarm.
It's possible.
Now hear this.
Now hear this.
Court reporter to sickbay.
Code Blue.
Urgent.
Statements to be taken at once from yeomen Burke and Samno.
Repeat.
Court reporter to sickbay.
Code Blue.
Urgent.
Statements to be taken.
Repeat.
Statements to be taken from yeomen Burke and Samno.
You have to shoot.
If you are logical, you have to shoot.
I do not want to.
What you want is irrelevant.
What you've chosen is at hand.
I'd just as soon you didn't.
The operation is over.
I did not fire.
You cannot prove anything.
Yes, I can.
At my trial, my personal log was used against me.
How long did you wait outside my quarters before I noticed you?
You knew?
I tried to tell you, but you would not listen.
Neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant.
There were things I tried to tell you about having faith.
You have betrayed the Federation.
All of you.
And what do you think you've been doing?
Saving Starfleet.
Klingons cannot be trusted.
Sir.
You said so yourself.
They killed your son.
Did you not wish Gorkon dead?
Let them die, you said.
Did I misinterpret you?
And you were right.
They conspired with us to assassinate their own chancellor.
How trustworthy can they be?
Klingons and Federation members conspiring together?
Who is us?
Everyone who stands to lose from peace.
Names, Lieutenant.
My comrades will make certain all your ship-to-shore transmissions are jammed.
Names, Lieutenant.
I do not remember.
A lie?
A choice.
Spock?
Admiral Cartwright.
From Starfleet?
Who else?
General...
General...
Chang.
Chang.
Who else?
Romulan...
Romulan...
Ambassador...
Ambassador...
Nanclus.
Nanclus.
Where is the peace conference?
Where is the peace conference?
She does not know.
Then we're dead.
I've been dead before.
Contact Excelsior.
She'll have the coordinates.
I've already got him, sir.
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
Sulu!
You realize that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations.
I'm sorry, Captain.
Your message is breaking up.
Bless you, Sulu.
Where is the peace conference?
They're going to attempt another assassination.
The conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border.
I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
I'm afraid we're gonna need more than that.
There's a bird-of-prey on the lookout for us, and she can fire while cloaked.
Surely not.
Hold on.
How many of those things are there?
Come on, Lieutenant.
Just the prototype.
You hear that?
I'm getting underway now, but we're now in Alpha Quadrant.
The chances of our reaching the conference in time are slim.
When does this conference start?
According to my information, today.
Thank you, Captain Sulu.
Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
Spock?
I prefer it dark.
Dining on ashes?
You were right.
It was arrogant presumption on my part that got us into this situation.
You and the doctor might have been killed.
The night is young.
You said it yourself.
It was logical.
Peace is worth a few personal risks.
You're a great one for logic.
I'm a great one for rushing in where angels fear to tread.
We're both extremists.
Reality is probably somewhere in between.
I couldn't get past the death of my son.
I was prejudiced by her accomplishments as a Vulcan.
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was.
Is it possible that we two, you and I, have grown so old and so inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?
Would that constitute a joke?
Don't crucify yourself.
It wasn't your fault.
I was responsible.
For no actions but your own.
That is not what you said at your trial.
That was as captain of the ship.
Human beings...
But, Captain, we both know that I am not human.
Spock, you want to know something?
Everybody's human.
I find that remark insulting.
Come on.
I need you.
Madam Chancellor, members of the Diplomatic Corps, honored guests,
the United Federation of Planets welcomes you to Camp Khitomer.
She's out here somewhere.
But if she is cloaked...
Then all we have is a neutron radiation surge, and by the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes.
209.
206.
203.
Close enough to beam down?
Not yet, Captain.
In two minutes.
158.
Go to impulse power for Khitomer orbit.
Aye, sir.
Let us redefine progress to mean that just because we can do a thing, it does not necessarily follow that we must do that thing.
Uhura?
Nothing, Captain.
If she's here, she's rigged for silent running.
Coming up on transporter range in 57 seconds.
Transporter Room, stand by to beam down.
53... 48 seconds.
44...
I can see you, Kirk.
Chang.
Can you see me?
Now, be honest, Captain.
Warrior to warrior, you do prefer it this way, don't you?
As it was meant to be.
No peace in our time.
Once more unto the breach, dear friends.
This is fun.
Reverse engines.
All astern.
One and a half impulse power.
Back off!
Back off!
What's she doing?
What's she waiting for?
Probably attempting to ascertain why we are reversing, wondering whether we detect her.
Incoming!
In range?
Not yet, sir.
Come on.
Come on.
She'll fly apart.
Fly her apart, then!
Many speculated, about my father's motives.
There were those who said he was an idealist.
Others said he had no choice.
If Praxis had not exploded, then quite possibly his idealism would not have found expression.
We are a proud race, and we are here because we intend to go on being proud.
Go to auxiliary power!
Auxiliary circuits destroyed, Captain.
Tickle us, do we not laugh?
Prick us, do we not bleed?
Wrong us, shall we not revenge?
Gas.
Gas, Captain.
Under impulse power, she expends fuel like any other vessel.
We call it plasma, but whatever the Klingon designation, it is merely ionized gas.
Well, what about all of that equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
Well, the thing's gotta have a tailpipe.
Doctor, would you care to assist me in performing surgery on a torpedo?
Fascinating.
Hard to starboard!
The proposed agenda is as follows.
The total evacuation of Kronos has been calculated within the 50-Earth-year time span.
Phase one, preparation for evacuation.
Come on, reach up!
Captain!
She's packing quite a wallop!
Shields weakening!
Shields up.
All right.
Now we've given them something else to shoot at.
Aye, sir.
The game's afoot, huh?
Excelsior's been hit.
Our revels now are ended, Kirk.
Cry Havoc!
And let slip the dogs of war.
Bones!
Where's my torpedo?
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed.
Emergency power!
Gravity control down!
Shields collapsing!
The key, please, Doctor.
Time is short.
The hull has been compromised.
I wonder how bad?
Connect echobars.
To discuss the report on phase two.
Alter circuit A. Sensor.
I propose that we commence with the minutes of the preparation.
I am constant as the northern star.
I'd give real money if he'd shut up.
Plate, please.
Plate.
And assimilation will consume...
We've got a heartbeat.
The Klingon empire, the ecological...
Key, please.
Key.
Where's that damn torpedo?
She's ready, Jim.
Lock and load.
Fire.
To be, or not to be.
Target that explosion and fire.
Fire.
As I imagine this work will occupy us throughout most of the week, it would be my hope that the delegation could return to their capitals to implement the provisions of phase one, no later than the first of next month.
Scotty.
As you know, time is of the essence.
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
Mr. President!
Mr. President!
Mr. President!
Mr. President!
Kirk, Enterprise.
Protect the Chancellor!
Arrest those men!
Arrest yourself.
We've got a full confession.
Cartwright, just a minute.
What's happened?
What's the meaning of all of this?
It's about the future, Madam Chancellor.
Some people think the future means the end of history.
Well, we haven't run out of history quite yet.
Your father called the future, the undiscovered country.
People can be very frightened of change.
You've restored my father's faith.
And you've restored my son's.
Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
And the good news is, they're not going to prosecute.
They might as well have prosecuted me.
I felt like Lieutenant Valeris.
Well, they don't arrest people for having feelings.
And it's a good thing, too.
If they did, we'd all have to turn ourselves in.
Captain Kirk.
Captain Sulu.
As much to the crew of the Enterprise, I owe you my thanks.
Nice to see you in action one more time, Captain Kirk.
Take care.
By God, that's a big ship.
Not so big as her captain, I think.
So... this is goodbye.
I think it's about time we got underway ourselves.
Captain, I have orders from Starfleet Command.
We're to put back to spacedock immediately, to be decommissioned.
If I were human,
I believe my response would be,
Go to hell.
If I were human.
Course heading, Captain?
Second star to the right, and straight on till morning.
Captain's Log, Stardate 9529.1.
This is the final cruise of the Starship Enterprise under my command.
This ship and her history will shortly become the care of another crew.
To them and their posterity will we commit our future.
They will continue the voyages we have begun, and journey to all the undiscovered countries, boldly going where no man.
Where no one, as gone before.
By LESAIGNEUR Sync corrections August 2016
Stardate 9521.6.
Captain's Log, U.S.S. Excelsior.
Hikaru Sulu commanding.
After three years,
I've concluded my first assignment as master of this vessel, cataloguing gaseous planetary anomalies in Beta Quadrant.
We're heading home under full impulse power.
I am pleased to report that ship and crew have functioned well.
According to this, we've completed our survey of the entire sector.
I have an energy wave at 240 degrees mark 6 port, sir.
Visual.
My God.
Shields.
Shields!
She's not answering her helm.
Starboard thruster.
Turn her into the wave.
Aye.
Quarter impulse power.
Damage report.
Checking all systems, Captain.
Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
Negative, sir.
The subspace shockwave originated at bearing 3-2-3 mark 75.
Location...
It's Praxis, sir.
It's a Klingon moon.
Praxis is their key energy production facility.
Send to Klingon High Command.
"This is Excelsior, a Federation starship.
"We have monitored a large explosion in your sector.
"Do you require assistance?"
- Aye, sir.
- Mr. Valtane, any more data?
Yes, sir.
I've confirmed the location of Praxis, but...
What is it?
I cannot confirm the existence of Praxis.
Onscreen.
Magnify.
Computer enhancement.
- Praxis?
- What's left of it, sir.
Captain, I'm getting a message from Praxis.
Let's have it.
This is Brigadier Kerla speaking for the High Command.
There has been an incident on Praxis.
However, everything is under control.
We have no need for assistance.
Obey treaty stipulations and remain outside the neutral zone.
This transmission ends now.
"An incident"?
- Do we report this, sir?
- Are you kidding?
What are we doing here?
Maybe they're throwing us a retirement party.
- That suits me.
I just bought a boat.
- This had better be good.
I'm supposed to be chairing a seminar at the Academy.
Captain, isn't this just for top brass?
If we're all here, where's Sulu?
Captain Sulu.
On assignment.
Where's Spock?
This briefing is classified.
Ladies and gentlemen, the CinC.
As you were.
To break this information down succinctly, the Klingon Empire has roughly 50 years of life left to it.
For full details, I'm turning this briefing over to the Federation's special envoy.
Good morning.
Two months ago, a Federation starship monitored an explosion on the Klingon moon Praxis.
We believe it was caused by over-mining and insufficient safety precautions.
The moon's decimation means the deadly pollution of their ozone.
They will have depleted their supply of oxygen in approximately 50 Earth years.
Due to their enormous military budget, the Klingon economy does not have the resources with which to combat this catastrophe.
Last month, at the behest of the Vulcan ambassador,
I opened a dialogue with Gorkon, Chancellor of the Klingon High Council.
He proposes to commence negotiations at once.
Negotiations for what?
The dismantling of our space stations and starbases along the neutral zone, an end to almost 70 years of unremitting hostility, which the Klingons can no longer afford.
Bill, are we talking about mothballing the Starfleet?
Well, I'm sure that our exploration and scientific programs
- would be unaffected, Captain, but...
- I must protest.
To offer Klingons safe haven within Federation space is suicide.
Klingons would become the alien trash of the galaxy, and if we dismantle the fleet, we'd be defenseless before an aggressive species with a foothold on our territory.
The opportunity here is to bring them to their knees.
Then we'll be in a far better position to dictate terms.
Sir?
Captain Kirk.
The Klingons have never been trustworthy.
I'm forced to agree with Admiral Cartwright.
This is a terrifying idea.
It is imperative that we act now to support the Gorkon initiative lest more conservative elements persuade his empire that it is better to attempt a military solution and die fighting.
You, Captain Kirk, are to be our first olive branch.
We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon vessel which is bringing Chancellor Gorkon to Earth and to escort him safely through Federation space.
Me?
Well, there are Klingons who feel the same way about the peace treaty as yourself and Admiral Cartwright, but they'll think twice about attacking the Enterprise under your command.
I have personally vouched for you in this matter, Captain.
You have personally vouched?
You will extend Chancellor Gorkon full diplomatic courtesy, Captain Kirk.
But a full ambassador would be better equipped...
If there's no further business,
I wish you and your crew Godspeed.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
I remind you, this meeting is classified.
I don't know whether to congratulate you or not, Jim.
I wouldn't.
We volunteered?
There is an old Vulcan proverb, "Only Nixon could go to China."
How could you vouch for me?
That's arrogant presumption.
My father requested that I open negotiations...
I know your father's the Vulcan ambassador, for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this.
They're animals.
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here.
Don't believe them.
Don't trust them.
- They are dying.
- Let them die.
Has it occurred to you that this crew is due to stand down in three months?
We've done our bit for king and country.
You should have trusted me.
Control, this is SD-103, approach to spacedock.
Over.
SD-103, you are clear to deliver Captain Kirk and party to NCC-1701 Alpha.
Over.
Captain on the Bridge.
- As you were, Lieutenant...
- Valeris, sir.
We were told that you needed a helmsman, so I volunteered.
Lieutenant, it is agreeable to see you again.
Lieutenant was the first Vulcan to be graduated
- at the top of her class at the academy.
- You must be very proud.
I don't believe so, sir.
She's a Vulcan, all right.
Let's get this over with.
Departure stations.
- Scotty.
- Aye, sir?
Did you find the engine room?
Right where I left it, sir.
Standby.
Uhura, get me the dockmaster.
Control tower reading, sir.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
This is Control, Enterprise.
Permission to depart granted.
Thirty seconds for port gates.
Clear all moorings.
Awaiting port gates from this mark.
All moorings clear.
Aft thrusters.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
One-quarter impulse power.
Captain, may I remind you that regulations specify thrusters only while in spacedock?
Jim?
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
Aye, sir.
Captain's Log, Stardate 9522.6.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I could never forgive them for the death of my boy.
It seems to me our mission to escort the Chancellor of the Klingon High Council to a peace summit is problematic at best.
Spock says this could be an historic occasion, and I'd like to believe him, but how on earth can history get past people like me?
Sorry.
You could have knocked.
We are almost at the rendezvous, sir.
I thought that you would like to know.
Right.
Permission to speak freely, sir.
It is an honor to serve with you.
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant.
I've always wanted to try that, sir.
You've done well, Valeris.
As your sponsor at the academy,
I have followed your career with satisfaction, and as a Vulcan, you've exceeded my expectations.
I do not understand this representation.
It is a depiction from ancient Earth mythology, the expulsion from Paradise.
Why keep it in your quarters?
It is a reminder to me that all things end.
It is of endings that I wish to speak.
Sir, I address you as a kindred intellect.
Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
History is replete with turning points, Lieutenant.
- You must have faith.
- Faith?
That the universe will unfold as it should.
- But is that logical?
Surely we must...
- Logic, logic and logic.
Logic is the beginning of wisdom, Valeris, not the end.
This will be my final voyage onboard this vessel as a member of her crew.
Nature abhors a vacuum.
I intend you to replace me.
I could only succeed you, sir.
Now hear this.
All officers to the Bridge.
Klingon battle cruiser off the port bow.
All officers to the Bridge.
Captain on the Bridge.
Shall we raise our shields, Captain?
Never been this close.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
- Uhura, hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Right standard rudder.
Bring us alongside.
Right standard rudder.
Z plus 5 degrees.
Channel is open, Captain.
This is the Starship Enterprise,
Captain James T. Kirk commanding.
This is Kronos One.
I am Chancellor Gorkon.
Chancellor, we've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting on Earth.
Thank you, Captain.
Would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard the Enterprise with my officers, as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We would be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
I shall look forward to that.
- Well, I hope you're happy.
- Captain, there is a supply of Romulan ale aboard.
It might make the evening pass more smoothly.
Officer thinking, Lieutenant.
Guess who's coming to dinner.
Energize.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- Captain Kirk.
May I present Captain Spock, whom I believe you know.
Captain, face to face at last.
- You have my thanks.
- Chancellor.
Gentlemen, this is my daughter Azetbur,
my military adviser, Brigadier Kerla, and this is General Chang, my chief of staff.
I have so wanted to meet you, Captain.
I'm not sure how to take that.
Sincere admiration, Kirk.
From one warrior to another.
Right.
This way.
I think you might enjoy a brief tour.
- They all look alike.
- What about that smell?
You know only top-of-the-line models can even talk...
You men have work?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.
Then snap to it.
I offer a toast.
"The undiscover'd country,"
the future.
- "The undiscover'd country." - "The undiscover'd country."
Hamlet, Act III, Scene 1.
You've not experienced Shakespeare until you have read him in the original Klingon.
Captain Kirk, I thought Romulan ale was illegal.
One of the advantages of being 1,000 light-years from Federation Headquarters.
To you, Chancellor Gorkon, one of the architects of our future.
- Chancellor.
- Chancellor.
Perhaps we are looking at something of that future here.
Tell me, Captain Kirk, would you be willing to give up Starfleet?
I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace.
Far be it for me to dispute my first officer, but Starfleet has always been at the fore...
Captain, there's no need to mince words.
In space, all warriors are cold warriors.
General, are you fond of
Shakespeare?
We do believe all planets have a sovereign claim to inalienable human rights.
Inalien?
If you could only hear yourselves.
"Human rights."
Why, the very name is racist.
The Federation is no more than a "Homo Sapiens Only" club.
Present company excepted, of course.
In any case, we know where this is leading.
- The annihilation of our culture.
- That's not true.
- No?
- No.
"To be, or not to be."
That is the question which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk.
- We need breathing room.
- Earth, Hitler, 1938.
I beg your pardon?
Well...
I see we have a long way to go.
We must do this again sometime.
You don't trust me, do you?
I don't blame you.
If there is to be a brave new world, our generation is going to have the hardest time living in it.
Captain Spock.
Chancellor.
- Madam.
- Captain.
Well, most kind.
"Parting is such sweet sorrow," Captain.
Have we not "heard the chimes at midnight"?
Thank God.
Did you see the way they ate?
Terrible table manners.
I doubt that our own behavior will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy.
I'm going to sleep this off.
Please let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight.
I'm going to go find a pot of black coffee.
The Enterprise hosted Chancellor Gorkon and company to dinner last night.
Our manners weren't exactly Emily Post.
Note to the galley,
Romulan ale no longer to be served at diplomatic functions.
Captain Kirk, will you please join me on the Bridge?
Captain Kirk?
- Captain.
- What is it?
I find this curious.
Spock, I'm really tired.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
Where?
Strangely enough, it appears to be emanating from us.
The Enterprise?
Valeris, do you know anything about a radiation surge?
Sir?
Chekov?
Only the size of my head.
I know what you mean.
- What's happened?
- We have fired on the Chancellor's ship.
Torpedo Room, please confirm.
Have we fired?
...0-6...
- Uhura, monitor.
- Aye, sir.
Direct hit.
Confirmed, sir.
We've lost gravity!
We are betrayed!
This is the Bridge.
Do you read?
Do you read?
Torpedo bay, did we fire those torpedoes?
Negative, Captain.
According to inventory, we're still fully loaded.
Find Chang.
Unable to confirm or deny firing of two photon torpedoes.
- Hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Kronos One, this is Enterprise.
Do you read?
Over.
Repeat.
Kronos One...
It's very hard to make out, Captain.
There's been some weapons firing and a lot of shouting.
She is still listing.
She's spinning out of control.
Restoring auxiliary gravity.
Have you not a shred of decency in you, Kirk?
We come in peace, and you blatantly defile that peace.
For that, I shall blow you out of the stars.
- We haven't fired.
- Captain.
According to our databanks, we have, twice.
Captain, they're coming about.
- They're preparing to fire.
- Shields up, Captain?
- Captain, our shields.
- Shields up, Captain?
- Signal our surrender.
- Captain?
We surrender!
- This is Enterprise.
We surrender.
- If they fire at us
- with our shields down...
- I repeat.
- We surrender.
- ...we will not be able to respond.
Repeat.
Enterprise surrenders.
- Are we firing torpedoes?
- I wish I knew.
Well, it sure looks like it.
I'm going aboard.
Spock, you have the conn.
I am responsible for involving you in this.
I will go.
No, I'll go.
You'll be responsible for getting me out of this.
We'll not be the instigators of full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
I'm going, too.
They may need a doctor.
- Perhaps you're right.
- Uhura, tell them we're coming, and tell them we're unarmed.
Aye, sir.
Have you lost your mind?
I give you my word, I don't understand what has happened.
We're here to help.
Follow me.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- My God.
- What has happened here?
- You dare to feign ignorance?
- What happened?
- With a direct torpedo hit, you crippled our entire gravitational field, and two of your Starfleet crew beamed aboard wearing magnetic boots and did this.
Aren't you carrying a surgeon?
We were until this disgrace.
Well, then for God sakes, man, let me help.
I've got a pulse.
We can move him.
I'm gonna need some light.
Can we get him up on this table?
Hold him.
Hold him while I stabilize him.
I said hold him.
Sweet Jesus.
- Can you...
- Jim, I don't even know his anatomy.
- His wounds are not closing.
- He's killing him!
He's gone into some kind of damned arrest.
Come on, damn it!
Come on!
He's not responding.
Don't let it end this way, Captain.
Under article number 184 of your interstellar law,
I'm placing you under arrest.
You are charged with assassinating our Chancellor of the High Council.
He tried to save him.
They've been arrested.
Mr. Spock, we've got to do something.
I assume command of this ship as of 0230 hours.
Commander Uhura, please notify Starfleet Headquarters.
Tell them precisely what has taken place
- and request instructions.
- Aye, sir.
We cannot allow them to be taken back to Kronos as prisoners.
What do you suggest, Lieutenant?
Opening fire will not retrieve them, and an armed conflict is precisely what the Captain wished to avoid.
We will be able to follow the Captain's movements.
- How did you achieve this, sir?
- Time is precious, Lieutenant.
We must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight.
According to our databank, this ship fired those torpedoes.
No way.
I sympathize, Mr. Scott, but we need evidence.
Please accompany me.
And if we cannot piece together what happened?
- What then, sir?
- In that case, Mr. Chekov, it resides in the purview of the diplomats.
The Chancellor of the High Council is dead!
The result of an unprovoked attack while he travelled to see you under a flag of truce, on a mission of peace.
Captain Kirk was legally arrested for the crime.
May I remind you that he and Dr McCoy boarded Kronos One of their own free will?
None of these facts are in dispute, Mr. President.
I have ordered a full-scale investigation.
- In the meantime...
- In the meantime, we expect the Federation to abide by the articles of interstellar law, which you claim to cherish.
Kirk and Dr McCoy will stand trial for the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon.
Out of the question.
Ambassador Sarek, there must be some way to extradite these men.
Mr. President, I share a measure of personal responsibility in this matter, but I am obliged to confirm my esteemed colleague's legal interpretation.
What is the position of the Romulan government,
Ambassador Nanclus?
I must concur with my colleagues.
But you can't possibly believe that James Kirk assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council.
Mr. President, I don't know what to believe.
I'm waiting for your answer, sir.
This president is not above the law.
Report back at once.
Do you copy?
At once.
Enterprise to report back on the double.
Do you read?
At once.
We're to report back at once.
We cannot abandon Captain Kirk and Dr McCoy.
Of course not.
Four hundred years ago on the planet Earth, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by automation flung their wooden shoes called "sabot" into the machines to stop them.
Hence the word "sabotage."
We are experiencing technical malfunction.
All backup systems inoperative.
Excellent.
I mean, too bad.
Mr. President,
I've been named Chancellor by the High Council in my father's place.
Madam Chancellor, you have my sincerest condolences on your recent loss.
I want to assure you that this shameful deed will not...
Mr. President, let us come to the point.
You want this conference to go forward, and so did my father.
I will attend in one week on one condition.
We will not extradite the prisoners, and you will make no attempt to rescue them in a military operation.
We would consider any such attempt an act of war.
We hope you'll be our guest here on Earth.
After recent events, you will understand if I say I prefer a neutral site, and in the interests of security, let us keep the location secret for now.
As you wish, Madam Chancellor.
Attack them now, while we still can!
Attack or be slaves in their world.
We can take whole by force, what they propose to divide.
War is obsolete, General, as we are in danger of becoming.
Better to die on our feet than live on our knees.
That wasn't what my father wanted.
Your father was killed for what he wanted.
The peace process will go forward.
Kirk...
Kirk will pay for my father's death.
- Kirk!

The Enterprise fired on Kronos One without provocation.
The Chancellor and his advisers having been lulled into a false sense of security by an invitation to a state dinner aboard Captain Kirk's vessel at precisely 1930 hours that same evening.
Call your first witness.
After the first shot, we lost our gravitational field.
I found myself weightless and unable to function.
Then two Starfleet crewmen came walking towards me.
But perhaps they merely wore Starfleet uniforms.
That remark is purely speculative.
I move that it be stricken.
Colonel Worf, we are interested in facts, not theories.
If the gravitational unit was not functioning, how could these men be walking?
They appeared to be wearing magnetic boots.
Gravity boots.
Dr McCoy, would you be so good as to tell me, what is your current medical status?
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
You have a singular wit, Doctor.
For 27 years, I've been ship surgeon aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.
In three months, I stand down.
You know, I believe that you consumed a rather generous amount of Romulan ale in the officers' mess on the night in question.
Am I right, Doctor?
- Objection!
- Sustained.
We all did.
All of us.
- That doesn't mean...
- Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
- Barely.
- Now be careful, Doctor.
Have you ever, in your past, saved patients as barely alive as he?
I didn't have the medical knowledge I needed for Klingon anatomy.
- I see.
- You were there.
You say you are due for retirement.
May I ask, do your hands shake?
- Objection!
- I was nervous.
No.
You were incompetent.
You were incompetent!
Whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink,
- the court will have to determine.
- My God, man!
I tried to save him!
I tried to save him.
I was desperate to save him.
He was the last best hope in the universe for peace.
The witness is excused.
There we have it, citizens.
We have finally established the particulars of the crime, and now we come to the architect of this tragic affair,
James Tiberius Kirk.
What would your favorite author say, Captain?
"Let us sit upon the ground
"and tell sad stories of the death of kings."
Tell us your sad story, Kirk.
Tell us that you planned to take revenge for the death of your son.
- That's not true.
- Objection!
Captain Kirk has not been identified as the assassin.
Sustained.
I offer into the record this excerpt from the Captain's personal log.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I have never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Again.
Again!
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I have never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Are those your words?
Those words were spoken by me.
Objection!
My client's political views are not on trial here.
On the contrary!
Captain Kirk's views and motives are indeed at the very heart of the matter.
This officer's record shows him to be an insubordinate, unprincipled, career-minded opportunist, with a history of violating the chain of command whenever it suited him!
Continue.
Indeed, the record shows that Captain Kirk once held the rank of Admiral, and that Admiral Kirk was broken for taking matters into his own hands in defiance of regulations of the law.
Do you deny being demoted for these charges?
Don't wait for the translation!
Answer me now!
I cannot deny it.
- You were demoted?
- Yes.
- For insubordination?
- On occasion, I have disobeyed orders.
And were you obeying or disobeying orders when you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?
I didn't know about the assassination until we boarded the ship.
You still deny the Enterprise fired on Kronos One?
- Well...
- Your Honors, please!
And you still deny your men beamed aboard and shot the Chancellor?
Objection!
I cannot confirm or deny actions I did not witness.
Captain Kirk, are you aware that as the captain of a starship, you are required to be responsible for the actions of your men?
I am.
And if it should be proved that members of your crew did, in fact, carry out such an assassination...
Jim, they're setting us up.
Your Honors...
Do not answer!
Captain Kirk, you will answer the question.
As captain,
I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
Your Honors, the State rests.
Send to Commander Enterprise.
"We stand ready to assist you.
Captain Sulu, U.S.S. Excelsior. "
It is the determination of this court that the prisoners are guilty as charged.
I wish to note for the record that the evidence against my clients is entirely circumstantial.
I beg the court to consider this when pronouncing its sentence.
So noted.
Captain James T. Kirk, Dr Leonard McCoy, in the interest of fostering amity for the forthcoming peace talks, the sentence of death is commuted.
It is the judgment of this court that, without possibility of reprieve or parole, you be taken from this place to the dilithium mines on the penal asteroid of Rura Penthe, there to spend the rest of your natural lives.
Rura Penthe?
Known throughout the galaxy as the aliens' graveyard.
Better to kill them now and get it over with.
Lieutenant, the torpedo hit once again, please.
Hold.
It is Enterprise.
- We fired.
- That is not possible.
All weapons visually accounted for, sir.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.
What exactly does that mean?
It means that if we cannot have fired those torpedoes, someone else did.
Well, they did not fire on themselves, and there were no other ships present.
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
Not from us!
A neutron surge that big could only be produced by another ship.
Kronos One?
Too far away.
Very near us.
Possibly beneath us.
If there were a ship beneath us, the Klingons would have seen her.
Would they?
- A bird-of-prey.
- A bird-of-prey.
Cloaked?
A bird-of-prey cannot fire when she's cloaked.
All things being equal, Mr. Scott, I would agree.
However, things are not equal.
This one can.
We must inform Starfleet Command.
Inform them of what, a new weapon that is invisible?
Raving lunatics, that's what they'll call us.
They'll say that we're so desperate to exonerate the Captain that we'll say anything.
And they would be correct.
We have no evidence, only a theory which happens to fit the facts.
Assuming you're right, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own president?
Indeed.
This ship will be searched from bow to stern.
Lieutenant Valeris, you'll be in charge.
- Aye, sir.
- I do not understand.
If there was a ship underneath us, surely the assassins beamed aboard from that vessel, not Enterprise.
You're forgetting something, Mr. Chekov.
According to our databanks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
If we did, the killers are here.
If we did not, whoever altered the databanks is here.
In either case, what we are looking for is here.
What are we looking for, sir?
Lieutenant?
Two pairs of gravity boots.
This is the gulag Rura Penthe.
There is no stockade, no guard tower, no electronic frontier.
Only a magnetic shield prevents beaming.
Punishment means exile from prison to the surface.
On the surface, nothing can survive.
Work well and you will be treated well.
Work badly and you will die.
Oh, my God.
The universal translator's been confiscated.
I'm sorry?
He's definitely on about something, Jim.
If this is your spot, we'll move on.
He wants your obedience to the brotherhood of aliens.
- He's got it.
- And your coat.
I'm afraid not.
Besides, it wouldn't fit.
Thanks.
This will help keep you warm.
I'm Martia.
You're Kirk and McCoy, I presume.
How'd you know that?
We don't get many presidential assassins.
- We didn't kill Gorkon.
- Of course not,
- but there is a reward for your death.
- It figures.
We've been set up all along.
Somebody up there wants you out of the way.
- Nothing in here.
- Nothing here.
- Any progress?
- None.
We have a crew of 300 turning their own quarters inside out, but the killers may still be among them.
Surely they have disposed of these boots by now.
Would it not have been logical to have left them on Gorkon's ship?
Even logic must give way to physics.
Gravity had not been restored by the time they escaped.
Without the boots, they would have floated off the Klingon transporter pads.
Why not simply vaporize them?
Like this?
At ease.
As you know, Commander Chekov, no one can fire an unauthorized phaser aboard a starship.
Suppose when they returned, they threw the boots into the refuse.
I'm having the refuse searched.
If my surmise is correct, those boots will cling to the killers' necks like a pair of Tiberian bats.
They could not make their escape without them, nor can they simply throw them out the window for all to see.
- Those boots are here somewhere.
- Did someone fire off a phaser?
It's all right.
It's nothing.
It's nothing.
Mr. Spock, Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
- Who fired that...
- Mr. Scott.
I understand you're having difficulty with the warp drive.
How much time do you require for repair?
There's nothing wrong with the bloody thing.
Mr. Scott, if we return to spacedock, the assassins will surely find a way to dispose of their incriminating footwear, and we will never see the Captain or Dr McCoy alive again.
- It could take weeks, sir.
- Thank you, Mr. Scott.
Valeris, please inform Starfleet Command
- our warp drive is inoperative.
- A lie?
An error.
You understand we have lost all contact with the Captain and Dr McCoy.
Yes.
At the moment, they're surrounded by a magnetic shield.
However, if I know the Captain, by this time, he is deep into planning his escape.
You got him, Jim!
You got him where you want him!
- You all right, Jim?
- I think so.
- They'll respect you now.
- That's a comfort.
- I was lucky that thing had knees.
- That was not his knee.
Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Anything you want to tell me?
Bones, why don't you see what you can do for him?
Let him know we're not holding a grudge.
Suppose he's holding a grudge?
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
- Do you want to get out of here?
- There's gotta be a way.
Three months before retirement.
What a way to finish.
- We're not finished.
- No?
Speak for yourself.
One day, one night, Kobayashi Maru.
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
I believe that was the general idea that I was trying to convey.
I don't mean this future.
- What is this, multiple choice?
- Some people are afraid of what might happen.
I was terrified.
What terrified you, specifically?
No more neutral zone.
I was used to hating Klingons.
It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word.
Spock was right.
Try not to be too hard on yourself.
We all felt exactly the same.
No.
Somebody felt a lot worse.
I'm beginning to understand why.
Well, if you've got any bright ideas, now's the time.
Time's the problem.
You and I are nothing.
But you heard the judge.
The peace conference is on again.
Whoever killed Gorkon is bound to attempt another assassination.
Unless we can get out of here.
Kirk, it's me, Martia.
Listen, no one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
- Except us.
- It is possible.
- I know how to get outside the shield.
- How do we fit in?
Getting outside the shield is easy, but after that, it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze.
Can you?
- It's possible.
- I can't make it alone, and you're likeliest candidate to come in this hellhole for months.
Candidate for what?
Go to lift seven in the morning for mining duty.
I'll see you there.
Don't disappoint me.
- What is it with you, anyway?
- Still think we're finished?
More than ever.
- I'm sorry to wake you, sir.
- What is it?
Starfleet urgently requests any data we have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
What?
Well, apparently, they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
Signal Starfleet that we have no idea location Enterprise.
Sir?
- You have hearing problems, mister?
- No, sir.
Klingon blood.
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
This is the first evidence which corroborates our theory.
Now we go to Starfleet.
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
All uniforms?
Take those out.
- Continue scanning.
- Nothing, sir.
Clear, sir.
Coming through.
Coming through.
Computer well seven clear.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Okay, let's see what we got.
Nothing.
Nothing so far.
Sir!
Sir!
- I think we've been had.
- No, you weren't, Doctor.
Get off at the first level.
Follow the gang into the mine.
They don't take girls.
You are Crewman Dax?
Yes, Commander.
What is the problem?
Perhaps you know Russian epic of Cinderella?
If shoe fits, wear it.
Mr. Chekov.
Watch me.
What kind of creature is this?
Last night, you two were...
Don't remind me.
Get in.
Come on.
We don't have a lot of time.
Hurry.
Up there.
Come on, climb.
Here.
You'll need these.
Quickly!
Stay close.
There they are.
They're emerging from the beaming shield.
- Mr. Scott, start your engines.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Mr. Chekov, set course for Rura Penthe.
Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe is deep inside the Klingon frontier.
- If we are discovered...
- Quite correct, Mr. Chekov.
What is required now is a feat of linguistic legerdemain and a degree of intrepidity before the Captain and Dr McCoy freeze to death.
- Leave me.
I'm finished.
- No!
Bones, I'm wearing a viridium patch on my back.
Spock slapped it there just before we went on Gorkon's ship.
- Why, that cunning little Vulcan.
- Come on.
We're in the clear.
Now that we're outside the shield, they'll be able to locate us two sectors away.
If they're even looking for us.
This is listening post Morska.
What ship is that?
Over.
We must respond personally.
A universal translator would be recognized.
We am thy freighter Ursva.
Six weeks out of
Kronos.
What is your destination?
Over.
We is condemning food,
things and supplies.
Don't catch any bugs!
Would you mind explaining that little trick you do?
- I'm a chameloid.
- I've heard about you.
Shapeshifters.
- I thought you were mythical.
- Give a girl a chance, Captain.
- It takes a lot of effort.
- I don't doubt it.
Stop me if I'm wrong, but do we have any way of knowing whether this is the real you?
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.
We're outside the shield.
Now it's your turn, Captain.
If you say so.
Are you crazy?
She didn't need our help getting anywhere.
Where'd you get these convenient clothes?
Don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue.
It's to let them know where we are.
Ask her what she's getting in return.
A full pardon, which doesn't cover this.
An accident wasn't good enough.
Come on, Spock.
Good enough for one.
Two would have looked suspicious.
Killed while attempting escape.
Now that's convincing for both.
Surprise!
- Your friends are late.
- They'll be along.
- I can't believe I kissed you.
- Must have been your lifelong ambition.
Isn't it about time you became something else?
I like it here.
Well, well, well.
What took you so long?
- Kill him.
He's the one.
- Not me, you idiot.
Him!
- No witnesses.
- Killed while trying to escape.
- Damn clever, if you ask me.
- It's a classic.
- That's what he wanted.
- Who?
Who wanted us killed?
Since you're all going to die anyway, why not tell you?
His name is...
Damn it to hell!
Of all the...
Son of a...
- Couldn't you have waited two seconds?
- Captain?
He was just about to explain the whole thing.
You want to go back?
- Absolutely not!
- It's cold.
This is the Bridge.
We are still in Klingon space.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
They were beamed aboard a Federation starship.
I could trace...
Escaped.
Kirk cannot know the location of the peace conference.
Are you sure?
Will you take that chance?
Helmsman, make course to intercept Enterprise.
The Klingons have a new weapon, a bird-of-prey that can fire when cloaked.
- She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
- So that's it.
Not entirely.
I have reason to believe that Gorkon's murderers
- are aboard this vessel.
- I have a thought about that.
Has the peace conference begun?
Who knows?
They're keeping the location secret.
- There's always something.
- Captain!
Mr. Spock!
I found the missing uniforms with the Klingon blood on them.
But the uniforms belong to these two men,
Burke and Samno.
Not anymore.
Phaser on stun at close range.
First rule of assassination, kill the assassins.
- Now we're back to square one.
- Can I talk to you?
I wonder why they weren't vaporized.
It would set off the alarm.
It's possible.
Now hear this.
Now hear this.
Court reporter to sickbay.
Code Blue.
Urgent.
Statements to be taken at once from yeomen Burke and Samno.
Repeat.
Court reporter to sickbay.
Code Blue.
Urgent.
Statements to be taken.
Repeat.
Statements to be taken from yeomen Burke and Samno.
You have to shoot.
If you are logical, you have to shoot.
I do not want to.
What you want is irrelevant.
What you've chosen is at hand.
I'd just as soon you didn't.
The operation is over.
I did not fire.
You cannot prove anything.
Yes, I can.
At my trial, my personal log was used against me.
How long did you wait outside my quarters before I noticed you?
You knew?
I tried to tell you, but you would not listen.
Neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant.
There were things I tried to tell you about having faith.
You have betrayed the Federation.
All of you.
And what do you think you've been doing?
Saving Starfleet.
Klingons cannot be trusted.
Sir.
You said so yourself.
They killed your son.
Did you not wish Gorkon dead?
"Let them die," you said.
Did I misinterpret you?
And you were right.
They conspired with us to assassinate their own chancellor.
How trustworthy can they be?
Klingons and Federation members conspiring together?
Who is "us"?
Everyone who stands to lose from peace.
- Names, Lieutenant.
- My comrades will make certain all your ship-to-shore transmissions are jammed.
Names, Lieutenant.
I do not remember.
A lie?
A choice.
Spock?
Admiral Cartwright.
From Starfleet?
Who else?
- General...
- General...
- ...
Chang.
- ...
Chang.
Who else?
- Romulan...
- Romulan...
- ...
Ambassador...
- ...
Ambassador...
- ...
Nanclus.
- ...
Nanclus.
Where is the peace conference?
Where is the peace conference?
She does not know.
Then we're dead.
I've been dead before.
Contact Excelsior.
- She'll have the coordinates.
- I've already got him, sir.
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
Sulu!
You realize that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations.
I'm sorry, Captain.
Your message is breaking up.
Bless you, Sulu.
Where is the peace conference?
They're going to attempt another assassination.
The conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border.
I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
I'm afraid we're gonna need more than that.
There's a bird-of-prey on the lookout for us, and she can fire while cloaked.
Surely not.
Hold on.
How many of those things are there?
Come on, Lieutenant.
- Just the prototype.
- You hear that?
I'm getting underway now, but we're now in Alpha Quadrant.
The chances of our reaching the conference in time are slim.
When does this conference start?
According to my information, today.
Thank you, Captain Sulu.
Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
Spock?
I prefer it dark.
Dining on ashes?
You were right.
It was arrogant presumption on my part that got us into this situation.
You and the doctor might have been killed.
The night is young.
You said it yourself.
It was logical.
Peace is worth a few personal risks.
You're a great one for logic.
I'm a great one for rushing in where angels fear to tread.
We're both extremists.
Reality is probably somewhere in between.
I couldn't get past the death of my son.
I was prejudiced by her accomplishments as a Vulcan.
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was.
Is it possible that we two, you and I, have grown so old and so inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?
Would that constitute a joke?
Don't crucify yourself.
It wasn't your fault.
I was responsible.
- For no actions but your own.
- That is not what you said at your trial.
That was as captain of the ship.
Human beings...
But, Captain, we both know that I am not human.
Spock, you want to know something?
Everybody's human.
I find that remark insulting.
Come on.
I need you.
Madam Chancellor, members of the Diplomatic Corps, honored guests,
the United Federation of Planets welcomes you to Camp Khitomer.
She's out here somewhere.
But if she is cloaked...
Then all we have is a neutron radiation surge, and by the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes.
209.
206.
203.
- Close enough to beam down?
- Not yet, Captain.
In two minutes. 158.
- Go to impulse power for Khitomer orbit.
- Aye, sir.
Let us redefine progress to mean that just because we can do a thing, it does not necessarily follow that we must do that thing.
- Uhura?
- Nothing, Captain.
If she's here, she's rigged for silent running.
Coming up on transporter range in 57 seconds.
Transporter Room, stand by to beam down.
...53 48 seconds.
...44...
I can see you, Kirk.
Chang.
Can you see me?
Now, be honest, Captain.
Warrior to warrior, you do prefer it this way, don't you?
As it was meant to be.
No peace in our time.
"Once more unto the breach, dear friends."
- This is fun.
- Reverse engines.
All astern.
One and a half impulse power.
Back off!
Back off!
What's she doing?
What's she waiting for?
Probably attempting to ascertain why we are reversing, wondering whether we detect her.
Incoming!
- In range?
- Not yet, sir.
Come on.
Come on.
- She'll fly apart.
- Fly her apart, then!
Many speculated about my father's motives.
There were those who said he was an idealist.
Others said he had no choice.
If Praxis had not exploded, then quite possibly his idealism would not have found expression.
We are a proud race, and we are here because we intend to go on being proud.
- Go to auxiliary power!
- Auxiliary circuits destroyed, Captain.
"Tickle us, do we not laugh?
Prick us, do we not bleed?
"Wrong us,
"shall we not revenge?"
Gas.
Gas, Captain.
Under impulse power, she expends fuel like any other vessel.
We call it plasma, but whatever the Klingon designation, it is merely ionized gas.
Well, what about all of that equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
- Well, the thing's gotta have a tailpipe.
- Doctor, would you care to assist me
- in performing surgery on a torpedo?
- Fascinating.
Hard to starboard!
The proposed agenda is as follows.
The total evacuation of Kronos has been calculated within the 50-Earth-year time span.
Phase one, preparation for evacuation.
Come on, reach up!
Captain!
She's packing quite a wallop!
Shields weakening!
Shields up.
All right.
Now we've given them something else to shoot at.
Aye, sir.
The game's afoot, huh?
- Excelsior's been hit.
- "Our revels now are ended," Kirk.
"Cry 'Havoc!
' and let slip the dogs of war."
Bones, where's my torpedo?
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed.
Emergency power!
Gravity control down!
Shields collapsing!
The key, please, Doctor.
Time is short.
The hull has been compromised.
- I wonder how bad?
- Connect echobars.
...to discuss the report on phase two.
- Alter circuit "A."
- Sensor.
I propose that we commence with the minutes of the preparation.
"I am constant as the northern star."
I'd give real money if he'd shut up.
- Plate, please.
- Plate.
...and assimilation will consume...
We've got a heartbeat.
The Klingon empire, the ecological...
- Key, please.
- Key.
Where's that damn torpedo?
She's ready, Jim.
Lock and load.
Fire.
To be, or not to be.
Target that explosion and fire.
Fire.
As I imagine this work will occupy us throughout most of the week, it would be my hope that the delegation could return to their capitals to implement the provisions of phase one, no later than the first of next month.
Scotty.
As you know, time is of the essence.
- Out of the way!
- Out of the way!
Mr. President!
Mr. President!
Mr. President!
Mr. President!
Kirk, Enterprise.
Protect the Chancellor!
- Arrest those men!
- Arrest yourself.
We've got a full confession.
Cartwright, just a minute.
What's happened?
What's the meaning of all of this?
It's about the future, Madam Chancellor.
Some people think the future means the end of history.
Well, we haven't run out of history quite yet.
Your father called the future the undiscovered country.
People can be very frightened of change.
You've restored my father's faith.
And you've restored my son's.
Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
And the good news is, they're not going to prosecute.
They might as well have prosecuted me.
I felt like Lieutenant Valeris.
Well, they don't arrest people for having feelings.
And it's a good thing, too.
If they did, we'd all have to turn ourselves in.
Captain Kirk.
Captain Sulu.
As much to the crew of the Enterprise, I owe you my thanks.
Nice to see you in action one more time, Captain Kirk.
Take care.
By God, that's a big ship.
- Not so big as her captain, I think.
- So, this is goodbye.
I think it's about time we got underway ourselves.
Captain, I have orders from Starfleet Command.
We're to put back to spacedock immediately to be decommissioned.
If I were human,
I believe my response would be,
"Go to hell."
If I were human.
Course heading, Captain?
Second star to the right, and straight on till morning.
Captain's Log, Stardate 9529.1.
This is the final cruise of the Starship Enterprise under my command.
This ship and her history will shortly become the care of another crew.
To them and their posterity will we commit our future.
They will continue the voyages we have begun, and journey to all the undiscovered countries, boldly going where no man...
Where no one has gone before.
Stardate 9521.6.
Captain's log U.S.S. Excelsior.
Hikaru Sulu commanding.
After three years I've concluded my first assignment as master of this vessel cataloguing gaseous planetary anomalies in Beta Quadrant.
We're heading home under full impulse power.
I'm pleased to report that ship and crew have functioned well.
According to this, we've completed our survey of the entire sector.
I have an energy wave at 240 degrees mark six port.
Visual!
My...
God!
Shields.
Shields!
She's not answering her helm.
Starboard thrusters.
Turn her into the wave.
Go to impulse power.
- Damage report.
- Checking all systems.
- That was no meteor shower.
- Negative, sir.
The sub-space shock-wave originated at bearing 323.75.
Location...
It's Praxis, sir.
It's a Klingon moon.
Praxis is their key energy production facility.
Send to Klingon High Command. "This is Excelsior, a Federation Starship."
"We have monitored a large explosion in your sector."
- "Do you require assistance?"
- Aye, sir.
- Mr Vultane, any more data?
- I've confirmed Praxis' location, but...
- I cannot confirm Praxis' existence.
- On screen.
- Magnify.
- Computer enhancement.
- Praxis?
- What's left of it, sir.
Captain, I'm getting a message from Praxis.
Let's have it.
This is Brigadier Kerla, speaking for the High Command.
There has been an incident on Praxis.
However, everything is under control.
We have no need for assistance.
Obey treaty stipulations and remain outside the Neutral Zone.
This transmission ends now.
- An incident?
- Do we report this, sir?
Are you kidding?
- What are we doing here?
- Maybe it's a retirement party.
That suits me.
I just bought a boat.
I'm supposed to be chairing a seminar at the Academy.
- Isn't this just for top brass?
- Where is Sulu?
Captain Sulu?
On assignment.
Where's Spock?
This briefing is classified.
Ladies and gentlemen, the C-in-C.
As you were.
I'll break this information down succinctly.
The Klingon empire has 50 years of life left.
For full details, I'm turning this briefing over to the Federation Special Envoy.
Good morning.
Two months ago a Federation Starship monitored an explosion on Praxis.
We believe it was caused by over-mining and insufficient safety precautions.
The moon's decimation means a deadly pollution of their ozone.
They will have depleted their oxygen supply in 50 Earth years.
Due to their enormous military budget the Klingon economy doesn't have the resources to combat this catastrophe.
Last month, at the behest of the Vulcan Ambassador, -
- I opened a dialogue with Gorkon, Chancellor of the Klingon High Council.
He proposes to commence negotiations at once.
Negotiations for what?
The dismantling of our space stations and bases along the Neutral Zone.
An end to 70 years of hostility, which the Klingons can no longer afford.
Bill, are we talking about mothballing the Starfleet?
Our exploration and scientific programs would be unaffected, but...
I must protest!
To offer Klingons safe haven within Federation space is suicide.
Klingons would become the alien trash of the galaxy.
If we dismantle the fleet, we'd be defenceless before an aggressive species on our territory.
The opportunity here is to bring them to their knees.
Then we'll be in a better position to dictate terms.
- Sir...
- Captain Kirk?
The Klingons have never been trustworthy.
I agree with Admiral Cartwright.
This is a terrifying idea.
It is imperative that we act now to support the Gorkon initiative, lest more conservative elements persuade his empire that it's better to attempt a military solution and die fighting.
You, Captain Kirk, are to be our first olive branch.
We are to rendezvous with the vessel which is bringing Gorkon to Earth and to escort him safely through Federation space.
Me?
There are Klingons who feel the same about the peace treaty as yourself, but they'll think twice about attacking the Enterprise under your command.
I have personally vouched for you in this matter.
You have personally vouched...?
You will extend Chancellor Gorkon full diplomatic courtesy, Captain.
- A full Ambassador is better equipped...
- If there's no further business I wish you and your crew Godspeed.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
I remind you this meeting is classified.
I don't know whether to congratulate you or not, Jim.
I wouldn't.
We volunteered?
There's an old Vulcan proverb.
"Only Nixon could go to China."
How could you vouch for me?
- That's arrogant presumption.
- My father requested that I open...
I know your father is the Vulcan Ambassador, but you know how I feel.
- They're animals.
- Jim...
- There is an historic opportunity here.
- Don't believe them!
Don't trust them.
- They're dying.
- Let them die.
Has it occurred to you that this crew is due to stand down in three months?
We've done our bit for king and country.
You should have trusted me.
Control, this is S-D 103, approach to Space dock.
Over.
You are clear to deliver Captain Kirk and party to N.C.C. 1701 Alpha.
- Captain on the bridge!
- As you were.
Lieutenant...?
Val'eris, sir.
We were told you needed a helmsman, so I volunteered.
It is agreeable to see you again.
She was the first Vulcan to graduate at the top of her class at the Academy.
- You must be very proud.
- I don't believe so, sir.
She's a Vulcan, alright.
Let's get this over with.
Departure stations.
- Scotty?
Did you find the engine room?
- Right where I left it.
Stand by.
Uhura, get me the dock master.
Control tower reading, sir.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
This is Control.
Permission to depart granted. 30 seconds for port gates.
- Clear all moorings.
- Awaiting port gates from this mark.
- All lines clear.
- Aft thrusters.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
1 quarter impulse power.
Captain, regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock.
Jim...
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
Aye, sir.
Captain's log.
Stardate 9522.6.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I can never forgive them for the death of my boy.
To escort the Chancellor of the Klingon High Council to a peace summit is problematic, at best.
Spock says this could be an historic occasion.
I'd like to believe him.
But how on Earth can history get past people like me?
- Sorry.
- You could have knocked.
We are almost at the rendezvous, sir.
I thought that you would like to know.
Permission to speak freely, sir.
It is an honour to serve with you.
You piloted well out of space dock, Lieutenant.
I've always wanted to try that.
You've done well, Val'eris.
As your sponsor at the Academy I've followed your career with satisfaction.
And as a Vulcan, you have exceeded my expectations.
I do not understand this representation.
It's a depiction from ancient Earth mythology.
"The expulsion from Paradise."
- Why keep it in your quarters?
- To remind me that all things end.
It is of endings that I wish to speak.
Sir, I address you as a kindred intellect.
Do you not recognise that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
History is replete with turning points.
You must have faith.
- Faith?
- The universe will unfold as it should.
- Is that logical?
Surely we must...
- Logic, logic, logic.
Logic is the beginning of wisdom, Val'eris.
Not the end.
This will be my final voyage on board this vessel as a member of her crew.
Nature abhors a vacuum.
I intend you to replace me.
I could only succeed you, sir.
Now hear this.
All officers to the bridge.
Klingon battle cruiser off the port bow.
All Officers to the bridge.
Captain on the bridge!
Shall we raise our shields, Captain?
I've never been this close.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
- Uhura, hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Right standard rudder.
Bring us alongside.
Right standard rudder.
Z plus 5 degrees.
Channel is open, Captain.
This is the Starship Enterprise.
Captain James T. Kirk commanding.
This is Kronos One.
I am Chancellor Gorkon.
We've been ordered to escort you to your meeting on Earth.
Thank you.
Would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard the Enterprise as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We would be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 19:30 hours.
I shall look forward to that.
I hope you're happy.
Captain!
There is a supply of Romulan ale aboard.
It might make the evening pass more... smoothly.
Officer thinking, Lieutenant.
Guess who's coming to dinner.
Energize.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- Captain Kirk.
May I present Captain Spock, whom I believe you know.
Captain, face to face at last.
You have my thanks.
Chancellor.
Gentlemen.
This is my daughter, Azetbur...
My military advisor, Brigadier Kerla and this is General Chang, my chief of staff.
I have so wanted to meet you, Captain.
- I'm not sure how to take that.
- Sincere admiration, Kirk.
From one warrior to another.
Right...
This way.
You might enjoy a brief tour.
- They all look alike.
- What about that smell?
You know only top of the line models can even talk...
- You men have work?
- Yes, ma'am.
Then snap to it.
I offer a toast.
The undiscovered country.
- The future.
- The undiscovered country.
Hamlet, act 3, scene 1.
You have not experienced Shake- speare until you've read him in Klingon.
Captain Kirk.
I thought Romulan ale was illegal.
An advantage of being 1,000 light years from Federation headquarters.
To you, Chancellor Gorkon.
One of the architects of our future.
Chancellor!
Perhaps we are looking at something of that future here.
Tell me, Captain Kirk.
Would you be willing to give up Starfleet?
The Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace.
I wouldn't dispute my first officer.
Starfleet has always been...
There's no need to mince words.
In space, all warriors are cold warriors.
General, are you fond of...
Shakespeare?
We believe all planets have a sovereign claim to inalienable human rights.
"Inalien..." If you could only hear yourselves.
"Human rights." Why, the very name is racist.
The Federation is a "homo sapiens only" club.
Present company excepted, of course.
We know where this is leading - the annihilation of our culture.
That's not true.
No!
"To be or not to be"...
That is the question which preoccupies our people.
- We need breathing room.
- Earth.
Hitler, 1938.
I beg your pardon?
Well...
I see we have a long way to go.
We must do this again sometime.
You don't trust me, do you?
I don't blame you.
If there is to be a brave new world, our generation is going to have the hardest time living in it.
- Captain Spock.
- Chancellor.
Madam.
Captain.
Well, most kind.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
Hmm, Captain?
"Have we not heard the chimes at midnight?"
Thank God!
- Did you see the way they ate?
- Terrible table manners.
I doubt our own behaviour will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy.
I'm going to sleep this off.
Is there any other way we can screw up tonight?
I'm going to go find a pot of black coffee.
The Enterprise hosted Chancellor Gorkon to dinner last night.
Our manners weren't exactly Emily Post.
To the galley
- Romulan ale no longer to be served at diplomatic functions.
Captain Kirk, will you please join me on the bridge?
Captain Kirk?
- Captain.
- What is it?
- I find this curious.
- Spock, I'm really tired.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
- Where?
- It appears to emanate from us.
The Enterprise?
Val'eris, do you know anything about a radiation surge?
Chekov?
Only the size of my head.
I know what you mean.
- What's happened?
- We've fired on the Chancellor's ship.
Torpedo room!
Please confirm, have we fired?
- Uhura, monitor.
- Aye, sir.
- Direct hit.
- Confirmed, sir.
This is the bridge.
Do you read me?
- Did we fire those torpedoes?
- Negative.
We're still fully loaded.
Unable to confirm or deny firing the torpedoes.
- Hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Kronos One, this is Enterprise.
Do you read?
It's very hard to make out.
There's been weapons firing and a lot of shouting.
- She's still listing.
- She's spinning out of control.
Have you not a shred of decency in you, Kirk?
We come in peace, and you blatantly defy that peace.
For that, I shall blow you out of the stars.
- We haven't fired.
- Captain...
According to our data banks, we have.
Twice...
Captain, they're coming about.
- They're preparing to fire.
- Shields up, Captain?
- Captain, our shields.
- Shields up, Captain?
Signal our surrender.
We surrender!
- This is Enterprise.
We surrender.
- If they fire, with our shields down we will not be able to respond.
- Repeat, Enterprise surrenders.
- Are we firing torpedoes?
- I wish I knew.
- I'm going aboard.
Spock, take the con.
- I involved you, I will go.
No, I'll go.
We'll not be the instigators of war on the eve of universal peace.
I'm going too, they may need a doctor.
Uhura, tell them we're coming, and tell them we're unarmed.
- Have you lost your mind?
!
- I don't understand what's happened.
We're here to help.
Follow me.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- My God!
What has happened here?
- You dare to feign ignorance?
- What happened?
With a direct torpedo hit, you crippled our gravitational field and two of your Starfleet crew beamed aboard wearing magnetic boots.
- Aren't you carrying a surgeon?
- We were until this disgrace.
Then for God's sake, let me help.
I've got a pulse - we can move him.
I need light.
Put him on the table.
Hold him!
Hold him while I stabilize him.
I said hold him!
Sweet Jesus.
- Can you...?
- I don't even know his anatomy.
- His wounds are not closing.
- He's killing him!
He's gone into some kind of damned arrest.
Come on, dammit!
Come on!
He's not responding.
Don't let it end this way, Captain.
Under article 184 of your Interstellar Law I'm placing you under arrest.
You're charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
He tried to save him.
They've been arrested.
Mr Spock, we've got to do something.
I assume command of this ship as of 02:30 hours.
Commander Uhura, notify Starfleet headquarters and request instructions.
We cannot allow them to be taken to Kronos as prisoners.
Opening fire will not retrieve them, and we must avoid an armed conflict.
We will be able to follow the Captain's movements.
- How did you achieve this?
- Time is precious.
We must piece together what happened here tonight.
According to our data bank, this ship fired those torpedoes.
- No way!
- I sympathize, but we need evidence.
Please accompany me.
And if we cannot piece together what happened?
What then, sir?
In that case, Mr Chekov, it resides in the purview of the diplomats.
The Chancellor of the High Council is dead!
The result of an unprovoked attack while he travelled to see you under a flag of truce on a mission of peace!
Captain Kirk was legally arrested for the crime.
He and Dr. McCoy boarded Kronos One of their own free will.
- None of these facts are in dispute.
- I have ordered an investigation.
- In the meantime...
- In the meantime we expect the Federation to abide by the articles of Interstellar Law.
Kirk and Dr. McCoy will stand trial for the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon.
Out of the question.
Ambassador Sarek, can we get them extradited?
Mr President, I share a measure of personal responsibility in this matter, but I am obliged to confirm my esteemed colleagues legal interpretation.
What is the position of the Romulan government?
I must concur with my colleagues.
You can't believe that Kirk assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council.
Mr President.
I don't know what to believe.
I'm waiting for your answer, sir.
This President is not above the law.
Mr President, Starfleet command is here from San Francisco.
- Mr President.
- Mr President.
Bill, Admiral Cartwright, please sit down.
Mr President, we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
I'm constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
Sir, would you please take a look at this.
We prepared Operation Retrieve based on the danger of terrorism between the Klingon empire and the Federation.
We can go in, rescue the hostages and get out in 24 hours with acceptable losses.
- We have the technology...
- Yes, yes.
But suppose you precipitate a full-scale war?
Then, quite frankly, we can clean their chronometers.
Mr President, they are vulnerable.
There will never be a better time.
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be.
I'll bear that in mind.
Thank you, gentlemen, that's all for now.
Mr President.
Sir...
Those men have literally saved this planet.
I know that.
And now they're going to save it again.
By standing trial.
Enterprise, report back on the double.
Do you read?
- We're to report back at once.
- We can't abandon Kirk and McCoy.
400 years ago, on Earth, workers who felt their livelihood threatened flung their wooden shoes called "sabots" into the machines to stop them.
Hence the word "sabotage".
We experience technical malfunction.
All back-up systems inoperative.
Excellent.
I mean... too bad.
Mr President, I have been named chancellor in my father's place.
Madam Chancellor, you have my condolences on your loss.
I assure you that this shameful deed will not...
Let us come to the point.
You want this conference to go forward.
I will attend in one week, on one condition.
We will not extradite the prisoners, and you will not attempt to rescue them.
We would consider any such attempt an act of war.
We hope you'll be our guest here on Earth.
After recent events, you will understand if I prefer a neutral site.
And in the interests of security, let us keep the location secret for now.
As you wish, Madam Chancellor.
Your father was killed for what he wanted.
The peace process will go forward.
Kirk...
Kirk will pay for my father's death.
It is as I said, Mr Spock.
Inventory registers every torpedo.
Yet the data banks insist we fired.
- One computer is lying.
- A computer doesn't lie!
Precisely.
Therefore we must inspect each torpedo visually.
That could take hours!
And if they're all there?
Then someone forged an entry in the data banks.
Gorkon's daughter has been named Chancellor.
It was on the news.
I'll bet that bitch killed her father.
- Her own father?
- It is an old story, sir.
They don't place the same value on life as we do, you know that.
Take my word, she did not shed one bloody tear.
Hardly conclusive, since Klingons have no tear-ducts.
Lieutenant, any response from Starfleet since our dispatch?
Yes, sir.
And?
Commander Uhura is experiencing technical difficulties, sir.
Curious.
Very well.
For 24 hours, we will agree this conversation didn't take place.
- A lie?
- An omission.
In 24 hours we won't have a clue where Captain Kirk is.
- I know precisely where he will be.
- You do?
Where?
Kirk, Kirk, Kirk, Kirk...
It's a damn show trial.
The Enterprise fired on Kronos One without provocation.
The Chancellor and his advisors having been lulled into a false sense of security by an invitation to a dinner aboard Captain Kirk's vessel at precisely 19:30 hours that same evening.
Call your first witness.
After the first shot we lost our gravitational field.
I was weightless and couldn't function.
Then two Starfleet crewmen came towards me.
Or perhaps they merely wore Starfleet uniforms.
That remark is speculative.
I move that it be stricken.
We're interested in facts, not theories.
If the gravitational unit was not functioning, how could they walk?
They appeared to be wearing magnetic boots.
- Gravity boots...?
- Dr. McCoy.
Would you be so good as to tell me what is your current medical status?
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
You have a singular wit, Doctor.
For 27 years I've been surgeon aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.
In three months I stand down.
You know...
I believe that you consumed rather a generous amount of Romulan ale in the officers mess on the night in question.
- Objection.
- Sustained.
We all did.
All of us.
That doesn't mean...
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
Barely.
Now be careful, Doctor.
Have you ever in your past saved patients as barely alive as he?
I didn't have the medical knowledge I needed for Klingon anatomy.
- I see.
- You where there.
You say you are due for retirement.
May I ask, do your hands shake?
- Objection!
- I was nervous.
No.
You were incompetent.
You were incompetent!
Whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink.
- The court will have to determine.
- My God, man.
I tried to save him!
I tried to save him.
I was desperate to save him.
He was the last best hope in the Universe for peace.
The witness is excused.
There we have it, citizens.
We have established the particulars of the crime.
And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair.
James Tiberius Kirk.
What would your favourite author say, Captain?
"Let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings."
Tell us your sad story, Kirk.
Tell us that you planned to take revenge for the death of your son.
- That's not true.
- Objection!
Captain Kirk has not been identified as the assassin.
I offer into the record this excerpt from the Captain's personal log.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I've never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I've never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Are those your words?
Those words were spoken by me.
Objection!
My client's political views are not on trial.
On the contrary.
Captain Kirk's views are at the very heart of the matter.
His record shows him to be an insubordinate, unprincipled opportunist with a history of violating the chain of command whenever it suited him.
Continue.
The record shows that Captain Kirk once held the rank of Admiral and he was broken for taking matters into his own hands.
Do you deny being demoted for these charges.
Answer me now!
- I cannot deny it.
- You were demoted?
- For insubordination?
- On occasion, I have disobeyed orders.
Were you obeying or disobeying orders when you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?
I didn't know about it until we boarded the ship.
You still deny the Enterprise fired on Kronos One?
And you still deny your men beamed aboard and shot the Chancellor?
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I didn't witness.
Are you aware that as the captain of a ship, you are responsible for the actions of your men?
I am.
If it's proved that members of your crew carried out the assassination...
- They're setting us up.
Your Honours!
- Do not answer.
Captain Kirk, you will answer the question.
As Captain I'm responsible for the crew under my command.
Your Honours, the state rests.
Send to Commander Enterprise.
"We stand ready to assist you.
Captain Sulu, U.S.S. Excelsior."
It is the determination of this court that the prisoners are guilty as charged.
I wish to note for the record that all the evidence is circumstantial.
I beg the court to consider this when pronouncing its sentence.
So noted.
Captain James T. Kirk, Dr. Leonard McCoy.
In the interest of fostering amity for the forthcoming peace talks, the sentence of death is commuted.
It is the judgement of this court that, without possibility of reprieve or parole, you be taken from this place to the dilithium mines on the penal asteroid of Rura Penthe.
There to spend the rest of your natural lives.
Rura Penthe!
Known throughout the galaxy as the alien's graveyard.
Better to kill them now and get it over with.
Lieutenant.
The torpedo hit once again, please.
Hold.
It is Enterprise.
We fired.
That is not possible!
All weapons visually accounted for, sir.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains must be the truth.
What does that mean?
That if we cannot have fired those torpedoes, someone else did.
They didn't fire on themselves and there are no other ships present.
- There was a neutron surge.
- Not from us.
A neutron surge that big could only be produced by another ship.
- Kronos One?
- Too far away.
Very near us.
Possibly beneath us.
If there were a ship beneath us, the Klingons would have seen it.
Would they?
- A Bird of Prey?
- A Bird of Prey.
- Cloaked?
- They can't fire when they're cloaked.
All things being equal, I would agree.
However, things are not equal.
This one can.
- We must inform Starfleet Command.
- Of what?
A new weapon that's invisible?
They'll call us raving lunatics.
They'll say we'll say anything to exonerate the Captain.
And they would be correct.
We have no evidence.
Only a theory which happens to fit the facts.
Assuming you're right.
Why would they fire on their own President?
Indeed.
This ship will be searched from bow to stern.
I do not understand.
If there was a ship underneath us surely the assassins beamed aboard from that vessel, not Enterprise.
You're forgetting something, Mr Chekov.
According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
If we did, the killers are here.
If we did not, whoever altered the data banks is here.
In either case, what we are looking for is here.
- What are we looking for, sir?
- Lieutenant.
Two pairs of gravity boots.
This is the gulag Rura Penthe.
There is no stockades, no guard tower, no electronic frontier.
Only a magnetic shield prevents beaming.
Punishment means exile from prison to the surface.
On the surface, nothing can survive.
Work well, and you will be treated well.
Work badly, and you will die.
Oh, my God!
The universal translator has been confiscated.
I'm sorry...?
He's definitely on about something, Jim.
If this is your spot, we'll move on.
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
- He's got it.
- And your coat.
I'm afraid not.
It wouldn't fit.
- Thanks.
- This will help keep you warm.
- I'm Martia.
You're Kirk and McCoy.
- How did you know that?
We don't get many presidential assassins.
- We didn't kill Gorkon.
- Of course not.
- But there's a reward for your death.
- That figures.
We've been set up.
Somebody up there wants you out of the way.
- Any progress?
- None.
A crew of 300 are looking everywhere, but the killers may still be among them.
Surely they have disposed of these boots by now.
Would it not have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
Logic must give way to physics.
Gravity wasn't restored when they escaped.
Without the boots, they would have floated off the transporter pads.
Why not simply vaporize them?
Like this?
As you know, no one can fire an unauthorized phaser aboard a starship.
Suppose, when they returned, they threw the boots into the refuse.
I'm having the refuse searched.
If I'm correct, those boots will cling to the killer's necks like Tiberian bats.
They couldn't escape without them nor throw them out the window.
Those boots are here.
Somewhere.
- Did someone fire off a phaser?
- It's alright.
It's nothing.
Mr Spock, Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
- Who fired the...
- Ah, Mr Scott.
I hear you have difficulty with the warp drive.
How long do you need for repair?
There's nothing wrong with the bloody thing.
If we return to space dock, the killers can dispose of their footwear and we will never see the Captain or Dr. McCoy alive again.
- It could take weeks.
- Thank you.
Val'eris, inform Starfleet our warp drive is inoperative.
- A lie?
- An error.
We have lost all contact with the Captain and Dr. McCoy.
Yes, at the moment they're surrounded by a magnetic shield.
But if I know the Captain, he is deep into planning his escape.
You've got him where you want him, Jim!
- Are you alright?
- I think so.
- They'll respect you now.
- I was lucky that thing had knees.
That was not his knee.
Not everybody keep their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Anything you want to tell me?
See what you can do for him.
Let him know we're not holding a grudge.
Suppose he's holding a grudge?
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
- Do you want to get out of here?
- There's got to be a way.
Three months before retirement.
What a way to finish.
- We're not finished.
- Speak for yourself.
One day, one night...
Kobayashi Maru!
Bones!
Are you afraid of the future?
I believe that was the general idea that I was trying to convey.
- I don't mean this future.
- What is this - multiple choice?
Some people are afraid...
of what might happen.
- I was terrified.
- What terrified you, specifically?
No more Neutral Zone.
I was used to hating Klingons.
It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word.
- Spock was right.
- We all felt exactly the same.
No.
Somebody felt a lot worse.
I'm beginning to understand why.
If you've got any bright ideas, now is the time.
Time is the problem.
You and I are nothing.
You heard the judge - the peace conference is on again.
Whoever killed Gorkon is bound to attempt another assassination.
Unless we can get out of here.
It's me
- Martia.
Listen.
No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
- Except us.
- It is possible.
I know how to get outside the shield.
- How do we fit in?
- Getting outside the shield is easy.
After that, you have to get us off the surface before we freeze.
Can you?
- It's possible.
- I can't make it alone.
You're the likeliest candidate to come here for months.
Candidate for what?
Go to lift 7 in the morning for mining duty.
I'll see you there.
Don't disappoint me.
- What is it with you, anyway?
- Still think we're finished?
More than ever.
Sorry to wake you, sir.
Starfleet requests any data we have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
What?
They're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to space dock, sir.
Signal Starfleet that we have no idea location Enterprise.
- Sir?
- You have hearing problems?
No, sir.
Klingon blood.
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
This is the first evidence which corroborates our theory.
Now we go to Starfleet?
We expand our search to include uniforms.
All uniforms?
Clear, sir.
Make a hole.
Coming through.
Coming through.
Sir!
Sir!
- I think we've been had.
- No, you weren't, Doctor.
Get off at the first level.
Follow the gang into the mine.
They don't take girls.
- You are crewman Dax?
- Yes.
What is the problem?
Perhaps you know the Russian epic of Cinderella?
If shoe fits - wear it.
Mr Chekov...
Watch me.
What kind of creature is this?
Last night you two were...
Get in.
Come on.
We don't have a lot of time.
Hurry!
Up there.
Come on - climb!
Here, you'll need these.
Quickly!
Stay close.
- There they are.
- They emerge from the beaming shield.
Mr Scott, start your engines.
Mr Chekov, set course for Rura Penthe.
Mr Spock, Rura Penthe is deep inside the Klingon frontier.
- If we're discovered...
- Correct.
We need a feat of linguistic legerdemain and intrepidity before the Captain and Dr. McCoy freeze to death.
- Leave me, I'm finished.
- No!
Bones, I'm wearing a viridium patch on my back.
Spock slapped it there before we went on Gorkon's ship.
That cunning little Vulcan.
Come on!
We're in the clear.
Now that we're outside the shield, they can locate us two sectors away.
If they're even looking for us.
We must respond.
A universal translator would be recognised.
"What is your destination, over?"
Would you mind explaining that little trick you do?
- I'm a Chameloid.
- I've heard about you.
Shape-shifters.
I thought you were mythical.
Give a girl a chance, Captain.
It takes a lot of effort.
I don't doubt it.
Stop me if I'm wrong, but do we have any way of knowing whether this is the real you?
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.
We're outside the shield.
Now it's your turn, Captain.
If you say so.
Are you crazy?
!
She didn't need our help.
Where did you get these convenient clothes?
Don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue.
It's to let them know where we are.
Ask her what she's getting in return.
A full pardon... which doesn't cover this.
An accident wasn't good enough.
Come on, Spock.
Good enough for one.
Two would have looked suspicious.
Killed while attempting escape.
That's convincing for both.
Surprise!
- Your friends are late.
- They'll be along.
- I can't believe I kissed you.
- Must have been your lifelong ambition.
Isn't it time you became something else?
I like it here.
Well, well, well...
What took you so long?
Kill him, he's the one.
Not me, you idiot - him!
- No witnesses.
- Killed while trying to escape.
- Damned clever, if you ask me.
- It's a classic.
- That's what he wanted.
- Who?
Who wanted us killed?
Since you're all going to die anyway, why not tell you?
His name is...
Damn it!
What the hell!
Son of a...!
Couldn't you have waited two seconds?
He was about to explain the whole thing.
- You want to go back?
- Absolutely not!
This is the bridge.
We're still in Klingon space.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
The Klingons have a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked.
- She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
- So that's it.
We believe that Gorkon's murderers are aboard this ship.
- Has the peace conference begun?
- Who knows?
The location is secret.
- There's always something.
- Captain!
Mr Spock!
I found the uniforms with the Klingon blood on them.
But the uniforms belong to these two men.
Burke and Samno.
Not anymore.
Phaser on "stun" at close range.
First rule of assassination - kill the assassins.
- Now we're back to square one.
- Can I talk to you?
- Why weren't they vaporized?
- It would set off the alarm.
It's possible.
Now hear this.
Now hear this.
Court reporter to sick bay.
Code blue - urgent.
Statements to be taken at once from Yeomen Burke and Samno.
Repeat, court reporter to sick bay.
Code blue - urgent.
Statements to be taken.
Repeat, statements to be taken from Yeomen Burke and Samno.
You have to shoot.
If you are logical, you have to shoot.
- I do not want to.
- What you want is irrelevant.
What you've chosen is at hand.
I'd just as soon you didn't.
The operation is over.
I did not fire.
You cannot prove anything.
Yes, I can.
At my trial my personal log was used against me.
How long did you wait outside my quarters before I noticed you?
You knew?
I tried to tell you, but you would not listen.
Neither of us was hearing very well that night.
There were things I tried to tell you, about having faith.
You have betrayed the Federation.
All of you.
- And what have you've been doing?
- Saving Starfleet.
Klingons cannot be trusted.
Sir...
You said so yourself.
They killed your son.
Did you not wish Gorkon dead?
"Let them die", you said.
Did I misinterpret you?
And you were right.
They conspired with us to assassinate their own Chancellor.
How trustworthy can they be?
Klingons and Federation members conspiring together.
- Who is "us"?
- All who stands to lose from peace.
Names, Lieutenant.
My comrades will make certain all your transmissions are jammed.
- Names, Lieutenant!
- I do not remember.
A lie?
A choice.
Spock.
Admiral Cartwright.
From Starfleet?
Who else?
General...
Chang.
- Who else?
- Romulan Ambassador and others.
Where is the peace conference?
Where is the peace conference?
She does not know.
Then we're dead.
I have been dead before.
Contact Excelsior.
- She'll have the co-ordinates.
- I've already got it, sir.
- Standing by, Captain Kirk.
- Sulu.
You realize that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations.
I'm sorry, Captain.
Your message is breaking up.
Bless you, Sulu.
Where is the peace conference?
They'll attempt another assassination.
It's at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border.
I'm sending the co-ordinates on a coded frequency.
We'll need more than that.
There's a Bird of Prey on the look-out for us that can fire while cloaked.
Surely not.
How many of those things are there?
Come on, Lieutenant.
- Just the prototype.
- Do you hear that?
I'm getting under way now.
We're in Alpha Quadrant.
The chances of our reaching the conference in time are slim.
- When does this conference start?
- According to my information - today.
- Thank you, Captain Sulu.
- Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
Spock?
I prefer it dark.
- Dining on ashes?
- You were right.
It was arrogant presumption on my part that got us into this situation.
You and the Doctor might have been killed.
The night is young.
You said it yourself, it was logical.
Peace is worth a few personal risks.
You're a great one for logic.
I'm a great one for rushing in where angels fear to tread.
We're both extremists.
Reality is probably somewhere in between.
I couldn't get past the death of my son.
I was prejudiced by her accomplishments as a Vulcan.
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was.
Is it possible that we two, you and I, have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?
Would that constitute a joke?
- It wasn't your fault.
- I was responsible.
- For no actions but your own.
- That's not what you said at your trial.
That was as captain of the ship.
Human beings...
We both know that I am not human.
Do you want to know something?
Everybody's human.
I find that remark... insulting.
Come, I need you.
Madam Chancellor, members of the diplomatic corps honoured guests.
The United Federation of Planets welcomes you to Camp Khitomer.
She's out here somewhere.
- But if she's cloaked...
- Then all we have is a radiation surge.
By the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes.
2.06... 2.03...
- Close enough to beam down?
- Not yet.
In two minutes. 1.58.
Go to impulse power for Khitomer.
Let us redefine progress to mean that just because we can do a thing it does not necessarily follow that we must do that thing.
- Uhura?
- Nothing, Captain.
If she's here, she's rigged for silent running.
Coming up on transporter range in 57 seconds.
Transporter room.
Stand by to beam down.
53... 48 seconds.
44...
I can see you, Kirk.
Chang.
Can you see me?
Now be honest, Captain.
Warrior to warrior.
You do prefer it this way, don't you?
As it was meant to be.
No peace in our time.
"Once more unto the breach, dear friends."
- This is fun.
- Reverse engines.
All astern.
One and a half impulse power.
Back off!
What's she waiting for?
Probably attempting to ascertain why we are reversing.
Wondering whether we detect her.
Incoming!
- In range?
- Not yet, sir.
Come on!
- She'll fly apart.
- Fly her apart, then!
Many speculated about my father's motives.
Some said he was an idealist.
Others said he had no choice.
If Praxis had not exploded, his idealism wouldn't have found expression.
We are a proud race.
We are here because we intend to go on being proud.
- Go to auxiliary power!
- Auxiliary circuits destroyed.
"Tickle us, do we not laugh?
Prick us, do we not bleed?"
"Wrong us, shall we not revenge?"
Gas.
Gas, Captain.
Under impulse power she expands fuel, like all vessels.
We call it "plasma", but it is merely ionised gas.
What about our equipment to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
The thing's got to have a tail-pipe.
Doctor, would you assist me in performing surgery on a torpedo?
Fascinating.
Hard to starboard.
The proposed agenda is as follows:
The evacuation of Kronos has been calculated within the 50 Earth year time span.
Phase 1 - preparation for evacuation...
Captain, she's packing quite a wallop.
Shields weakening.
Shields up!
Alright, now we're giving them something else to shoot at.
The game's afoot.
- Excelsior's been hit!
- "Our revels now are ended", Kirk.
"Cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war."
- Bones, where's my torpedo?
- Bet you wished you'd stayed in bed.
Shields collapsing!
The key, please.
Time is short.
- The hull has been compromised.
- I wonder how bad.
Connect echo-bars.
...discuss the report on phase 2.
- Alter circuit A.
- Sensor.
...we commence within minutes of the preparation.
- "I am constant as the Northern star."
- I'd give real money, if he'd shut up.
Plate, please.
...and assimilation will consume...
We've got a heart beat.
...with the Klingon Empire...
Key, please.
- Where's that torpedo?
- She's ready.
Lock and load!
Fire!
"To be... or not" "to be."
Target that explosion and fire.
Fire!
This work will occupy us throughout most of the week.
I hope that the delegation can implement the provisions of Phase 1 by the first of next month.
As you know, time is of the essence.
Out of the way!
Mr President!
Mr President!
Kirk, Enterprise.
- Arrest those men!
- Arrest yourself!
We've got a full confession.
- This is not Klingon blood.
- Cartwright.
Just a minute.
It's Colonel West!
What's happened?
What's the mean of all of this?
It's about the future, Madam Chancellor.
Some people think the future means the end of history.
We haven't run out of history quite yet.
Your father called the future "the undiscovered country".
People can be very frightened of change.
You've restored my father's faith.
And you've restored my son's.
Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
And they're not going to prosecute.
They could have prosecuted me.
I felt like Val'eris.
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
And it's a good thing, too.
If they did, we'd all have to turn ourselves in.
- Captain Kirk.
- Captain Sulu.
As much to the crew of the Enterprise, I owe you my thanks.
Nice to see you in action one more time, Captain Kirk.
Take care.
- My God, that's a big ship.
- Not so big as her captain.
So...
This is goodbye?
It's about time we got underway ourselves.
Captain, I have orders from Starfleet Command.
We're to put back to space dock immediately... to be decommissioned.
If I were human, I believe my response would be:
"Go to hell."
If I were human.
Course heading, Captain?
Second star to the right.
And straight on 'til morning.
Captain's log, stardate 9529.1.
This is the final cruise of the Starship Enterprise under my command.
This ship, and her history will shortly become the care of another crew.
To them and their posterity will we commit our future.
They'll continue the voyages we have begun and journey to all the undiscovered countries boldly going where no man, where no one has gone before.
DVDRIP by Feedback Overflow.
Stardate 9521.6.
Captain's log U.S.S. Excelsior.
Hikaru Sulu commanding.
After three years I've concluded my first assignment as master of this vessel cataloguing gaseous planetary anomalies in Beta Quadrant.
We're heading home under full impulse power.
I'm pleased to report that ship and crew have functioned well.
According to this, we've completed our survey of the entire sector.
I have an energy wave at 240 degrees mark six port.
Visual!
My...
God!
Shields.
Shields!
She's not answering her helm.
Starboard thrusters.
Turn her into the wave.
Go to impulse power.
- Damage report.
- Checking all systems.
- That was no meteor shower.
- Negative, sir.
The sub-space shock-wave originated at bearing 323.75.
Location...
It's Praxis, sir.
It's a Klingon moon.
Praxis is their key energy production facility.
Send to Klingon High Command. "This is Excelsior, a Federation Starship."
"We have monitored a large explosion in your sector."
- "Do you require assistance?"
- Aye, sir.
- Mr Vultane, any more data?
- I've confirmed Praxis' location, but...
- I cannot confirm Praxis' existence.
- On screen.
- Magnify.
- Computer enhancement.
- Praxis?
- What's left of it, sir.
Captain, I'm getting a message from Praxis.
Let's have it.
This is Brigadier Kerla, speaking for the High Command.
There has been an incident on Praxis.
However, everything is under control.
We have no need for assistance.
Obey treaty stipulations and remain outside the Neutral Zone.
This transmission ends now.
- An incident?
- Do we report this, sir?
Are you kidding?
- What are we doing here?
- Maybe it's a retirement party.
That suits me.
I just bought a boat.
I'm supposed to be chairing a seminar at the Academy.
- Isn't this just for top brass?
- Where is Sulu?
Captain Sulu?
On assignment.
Where's Spock?
This briefing is classified.
Ladies and gentlemen, the C-in-C.
As you were.
I'll break this information down succinctly.
The Klingon empire has 50 years of life left.
For full details, I'm turning this briefing over to Federation Special Envoy.
Good morning.
Two months ago a Federation Starship monitored an explosion on Praxis.
We believe it was caused by over-mining and insufficient safety precautions.
The moon's decimation means deadly pollution of their ozone.
They will have depleted their oxygen supply in 50 Earth years.
Due to their enormous military budget the Klingon economy doesn't have the resources to combat this catastrophe.
Last month, at the behest of the Vulcan Ambassador, -
- I opened a dialogue with Gorkon, Chancellor of the Klingon High Council.
He proposes to commence negotiations at once.
Negotiations for what?
The dismantling of our space stations and bases along the Neutral Zone, an end to 70 years of hostility, which the Klingons can no longer afford.
Bill, are we talking about mothballing the Starfleet?
Our exploration and scientific programs would be unaffected, but...
I must protest!
To offer Klingons safe haven within Federation space is suicide.
Klingons would become the alien trash of the galaxy.
If we dismantle the fleet, we'd be defenceless before an aggressive species on our territory.
The opportunity here is to bring them to their knees.
Then we'll be in a better position to dictate terms.
- Sir...
- Captain Kirk?
The Klingons have never been trustworthy.
I agree with Admiral Cartwright.
This is a terrifying idea.
It is imperative that we act now to support the Gorkon initiative, lest more conservative elements persuade his empire that it's better to attempt a military solution and die fighting.
You, Captain Kirk, are to be our first olive branch.
We are to rendezvous with the vessel which is bringing Gorkon to Earth and to escort him safely through Federation space.
Me?
There are Klingons who feel the same about the peace treaty as yourself, but they'll think twice about attacking the Enterprise under your command.
I have personally vouched for you in this matter.
You have personally vouched...?
You will extend Chancellor Gorkon full diplomatic courtesy, Captain.
- A full Ambassador is better equipped...
- If there's no further business I wish you and your crew Godspeed.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
I remind you this meeting is classified.
I don't know whether to congratulate you or not, Jim.
I wouldn't.
We volunteered?
There's an old Vulcan proverb.
"Only Nixon could go to China."
How could you vouch for me?
- That's arrogant presumption.
- My father requested that I open...
I know your father is the Vulcan Ambassador, but you know how I feel.
- They're animals.
- Jim...
- There is an historic opportunity here.
- Don't believe them!
Don't trust them.
- They're dying.
- Let them die.
Has it occurred to you that this crew is due to stand down in three months?
We've done our bit for king and country.
You should have trusted me.
Control, this is S-D 103, approach to Space dock.
Over.
You are clear to deliver Captain Kirk and party to N.C.C. 1701 Alpha.
- Captain on the bridge!
- As you were.
Lieutenant?
Val'eris, sir.
We were told you needed a helmsman, so I volunteered.
It is agreeable to see you again.
She was the first Vulcan to graduate at the top of her class at the Academy.
- You must be very proud.
- I don't believe so, sir.
She's a Vulcan, alright.
Let's get this over with.
Departure stations.
- Scotty?
Did you find the engine room?
- Right where I left it.
Stand by.
Uhura, get me the dock master.
Control tower reading, sir.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
This is Control.
Permission to depart granted. 30 seconds for port gates.
- Clear all moorings.
- Awaiting port gates from this mark.
- All lines clear.
- Aft thrusters.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
1 quarter impulse power.
Captain, regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock.
Jim...
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
Aye, sir.
Captain's log.
Stardate 9522.6.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I can never forgive them for the death of my boy.
To escort the Chancellor of the Klingon High Council to a peace summit is problematic, at best.
Spock says this could be an historic occasion.
I'd like to believe him.
But how on Earth can history get past people like me?
- Sorry.
- You could have knocked.
We are almost at the rendezvous, sir.
I thought that you would like to know.
Permission to speak freely, sir.
It is an honour to serve with you.
You piloted well out of space dock, Lieutenant.
I've always wanted to try that.
You've done well, Val'eris.
As your sponsor at the Academy I've followed your career with satisfaction.
And as a Vulcan, you have exceeded my expectations.
I do not understand this representation.
It's a depiction from ancient Earth mythology.
"The expulsion from Paradise."
- Why keep it in your quarters?
- To remind me that all things end.
It is of endings that I wish to speak.
Sir, I address you as a kindred intellect.
Do you not recognise that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
History is replete with turning points.
You must have faith.
- Faith?
- The universe will unfold as it should.
- Is that logical?
Surely we must...
- Logic, logic, logic.
Logic is the beginning of wisdom, Val'eris.
Not the end.
This will be my final voyage on board this vessel as a member of her crew.
Nature abhors a vacuum.
I intend you to replace me.
I could only succeed you, sir.
Now hear this.
All offiicers to the bridge.
Klingon battle cruiser off the port bow.
All Officers to the bridge.
Captain on the bridge!
Shall we raise our shields, Captain?
I've never been this close.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
- Uhura, hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Right standard rudder.
Bring us alongside.
Right standard rudder.
Z plus 5 degrees.
Channel is open, Captain.
This is the Starship Enterprise.
Captain James T. Kirk commanding.
This is Kronos One.
I am Chancellor Gorkon.
We've been ordered to escort you to your meeting on Earth.
Thank you.
Would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard the Enterprise as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We would be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 19:30 hours.
I shall look forward to that.
I hope you're happy.
Captain!
There is a supply of Romulan ale aboard.
It might make the evening pass more... smoothly.
Officer thinking, Lieutenant.
Guess who's coming to dinner.
Energize.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- Captain Kirk.
May I present Captain Spock, whom I believe you know.
Captain, face to face at last.
You have my thanks.
Chancellor.
Gentlemen.
This is my daughter, Azetbur...
My military advisor, Brigadier Kerla...
General Chang, my chief of staff.
I have so wanted to meet you, Captain.
- I'm not sure how to take that.
- Sincere admiration, Kirk.
From one warrior to another.
Right...
This way.
You might enjoy a brief tour.
- They all look alike.
- What about that smell?
You know only top of the line models can even talk...
- You men have work?
- Yes, ma'am.
Then snap to it.
I offer a toast.
The undiscovered country.
- The future.
- The undiscovered country.
Hamlet, act 3, scene 1 .
You have not experienced Shake- speare until you've read him in Klingon.
Captain Kirk.
I thought Romulan ale was illegal.
An advantage of being 1,000 light years from Federation headquarters.
To you, Chancellor Gorkon.
One of the architects of our future.
Chancellor!
Perhaps we are looking at something of that future here.
Tell me, Captain Kirk.
Would you be willing to give up Starfleet?
The Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace.
I wouldn't dispute my first officer.
Starfleet has always been...
There's no need to mince words.
In space, all warriors are cold warriors.
General, are you fond of...
Shakespeare?
We believe all planets have a sovereign claim to inalienable human rights.
"Inalien..." If you could only hear yourselves.
"Human rights." Why, the very name is racist.
The Federation is a "homo sapiens only" club.
Present company excepted, of course.
We know where this is leading - the annihilation of our culture.
That's not true.
No!
"To be or not to be"...
That is the question which preoccupies our people.
- We need breathing room.
- Earth.
Hitler, 1938.
I beg your pardon.
Well...
I see we have a long way to go.
We must do this again sometime.
You don't trust me, do you?
I don't blame you.
If there is to be a brave new world, our generation is going to have the hardest time living in it.
- Captain Spock.
- Chancellor.
Madam.
Captain.
Well, most kind.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
Hmm, Captain?
"Have we not heard the chimes at midnight?"
Thank God!
- Did you see the way they ate?
- Terrible table manners.
I doubt our own behaviour will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy.
I'm going to sleep this off.
Is there any other way we can screw up tonight?
I'm going to go find a pot of black coffee.
The Enterprise hosted Chancellor Gorkon to dinner last night.
Our manners weren't exactly Emily Post.
To the galley
- Romulan ale no longer to be served at diplomatic functions.
Captain Kirk, will you please join me on the bridge?
Captain Kirk?
- Captain.
- What is it?
- I find this curious.
- Spock, I'm really tired.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
- Where?
- It appears to emanate from us.
The Enterprise?
Val'eris, do you know anything about a radiation surge?
Chekov?
Only the size of my head.
I know what you mean.
- What's happened?
- We've fired on the Chancellor's ship.
Torpedo room!
Please confirm, have we fired?
- Uhura, monitor.
- Aye, sir.
- Direct hit.
- Confirmed, sir.
We've lost gravity!
We are betrayed!
This is the bridge.
Do you read me?
- Did we fire those torpedoes?
- Negative.
We're still fully loaded.
Find Chang.
Unable to confirm or deny firing the torpedoes.
- Hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Kronos One, this is Enterprise.
Do you read?
It's very hard to make out.
There's been weapons firing and a lot of shouting.
- She's still listing.
- She's spinning out of control.
Restoring auxiliary gravity...
Have you not a shred of decency in you, Kirk?
We come in peace, and you blatantly defy that peace.
For that, I shall blow you out of the stars.
- We haven't fired.
- Captain...
According to our data banks, we have.
Twice...
Captain, they're coming about.
- They're preparing to fire.
- Shields up, Captain?
- Captain, our shields.
- Shields up, Captain?
Signal our surrender.
We surrender!
- This is Enterprise.
We surrender.
- If they fire, with our shields down...
- ...we will not be able to respond.
- Repeat, Enterprise surrenders.
- Are we firing torpedoes?
- I wish I knew.
- I'm going aboard.
Spock, take the con.
- I involved you, I will go.
No, I'll go.
We'll not be the instigators of war on the eve of universal peace.
I'm going too, they may need a doctor.
Uhura, tell them we're coming, and tell them we're unarmed.
- Have you lost your mind?
!
- I don't understand what's happened.
We're here to help.
Follow me.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- My God!
What has happened here?
- You dare to feign ignorance?
- What happened?
With a direct torpedo hit, you crippled our gravitational field and two of your Starfleet crew beamed aboard wearing magnetic boots.
- Aren't you carrying a surgeon?
- We were until this disgrace.
Then for god's sake, let me help.
I've got a pulse - we can move him.
I need light.
Put him on the table.
Hold him!
Hold him while I stabilize him.
I said hold him!
Sweet Jesus.
- Can you...?
- I don't even know his anatomy.
- His wounds are not closing.
- He's killing him!
He's gone into some kind of damned arrest.
Come on, dammit!
Come on!
He's not responding.
Don't let it end this way, Captain.
Under article 184 of your Interstellar Law I'm placing you under arrest.
You're charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
He tried to save him.
They've been arrested.
Mr Spock, we've got to do something.
I assume command of this ship as of 02:30 hours.
Commander Uhura, notify Starfleet headquarters and request instructions.
We cannot allow them to be taken to Kronos as prisoners.
Opening fire will not retrieve them, and we must avoid an armed conflict.
We will be able to follow the Captain's movements.
- How did you achieve this?
- Time is precious.
We must piece together what happened here tonight.
According to our data bank, this ship fired those torpedoes.
- No way!
- I sympathize, but we need evidence.
Please accompany me.
And if we cannot piece together what happened?
What then, sir?
In that case, Mr Chekov, it resides in the purview of the diplomats.
The Chancellor of the High Council is dead!
The result of an unprovoked attack while he travelled to see you under a flag of truce on a mission of peace!
Captain Kirk was legally arrested for the crime.
He and Dr. McCoy boarded Kronos One of their own free will.
- None of these facts are in dispute.
- I have ordered an investigation.
- In the meantime...
- In the meantime we expect the Federation to abide by the articles of Interstellar Law.
Kirk and Dr. McCoy will stand trial for the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon.
Out of the question.
Ambassador Sarek, can we get them extradited?
I share a measure of personal responsibility in this matter, but I am obliged to confirm my esteemed colleagues legal interpretation.
What is the position of the Romulan government?
I must concur with my colleagues.
You can't believe that Kirk assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council.
Mr President.
I don't know what to believe.
I'm waiting for your answer, sir.
This President is not above the law.
Mr President, Starfleet command is here from San Francisco.
- Mr President.
- Mr President.
Bill, Admiral Cartwright, please sit down.
Mr President, we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
I'm constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
Sir, would you please take a look at this.
We prepared Operation Retrieve based on the danger of terrorism between the Klingon empire and the Federation.
We can go in, rescue the hostages and get out in 24 hours with acceptable losses.
- We have the technology...
- Yes, yes.
But suppose you precipitate a full-scale war?
Then, quite frankly, we can clean their chronometers.
Mr President, they are vulnerable.
There will never be a better time.
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be.
I'll bear that in mind.
Thank you, gentlemen, that's all for now.
Mr President.
Sir...
Those men have literally saved this planet.
And now they're going to save it again.
By standing trial.
Report back on the double.
Do you read?
- We're to report back at once.
- We can't abandon Kirk and McCoy.
400 years ago, on Earth, workers who felt their livelyhood threatened flung their wooden shoes called "sabots" into the machines to stop them.
Hence the word "sabotage".
We experience technical malfunction.
All back-up systems inoperative.
Excellent.
I mean... too bad.
Mr President, I have been named chancellorin my father's place.
Madam Chancellor, you have my condolences on your loss.
I assure you that this shameful deed will not...
Let us come to the point.
You want this conference to go forward.
I will attend in one week, on one condition.
We will not extradite the prisoners, and you will not attempt to rescue them.
We would consider any such attempt an act of war.
We hope you'll be our guest here on Earth.
After recent events, you will understand if I prefer a neutral site.
And in the interest of security, let us keep the location secret for now.
As you wish, Madam Chancellor.
Attack them now, while we still can.
Attack or be slaves in their world.
We can take whole by force, what they propose to divide.
War is obsolete, General.
As we are in danger of becoming.
Better to die on our feet than live on our knees.
That wasn't what my father wanted.
Your father was killed for what he wanted.
The peace process will go forward.
Kirk...
Kirk will pay for my father's death.
It is as I said, Mr Spock.
Inventory registers every torpedo.
Yet the data banks insist we fired.
- One computer is lying.
- A computer doesn't lie!
Precisely.
Therefore we must inspect each torpedo visually.
That could take hours!
And if they're all there?
Then someone forged an entry in the data banks.
Gorkon's daughter has been named Chancellor.
It was on the news.
I'll bet that bitch killed her father.
- Her own father?
- It is an old story, sir.
They don't place the same value on life as we do, you know that.
Take my word, she did not shed one bloody tear.
Hardly conclusive, since Klingons have no tear-ducts.
Lieutenant, any response from Starfleet since our dispatch?
Yes, sir.
And?
Commander Uhura is experiencing technical difficulties, sir.
Curious.
Very well.
For 24 hours, we will agree this conversation didn't take place.
- A lie?
- An omission.
In 24 hours we won't have a clue where Captain Kirk is.
- I know precisely where he will be.
- You do?
Where?
Kirk, Kirk, Kirk, Kirk...
It's a damn show trial.
The Enterprise fired on Kronos One without provocation.
The Chancellor and his advisors having been lulled into a false sense of security by an invitation to a dinner aboard Captain Kirk's vessel at precisely 19:30 hours that same evening.
Call your first witness.
After the first shot we lost our gravitational field.
I was weightless and couldn't function.
Then two Starfleet crewmen came towards me.
Or perhaps they merely wore Starfleet uniforms.
That remark is speculative.
I move that it be stricken.
We're interested in facts, not theories.
If the gravitational unit was not functioning, how could they walk?
They appeared to be wearing magnetic boots.
- Gravity boots...?
- Dr. McCoy.
Would you be so good as to tell me what is your current medical status?
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
You have a singular wit, Doctor.
For 27 years I've been surgeon aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.
In three months I stand down.
You know...
I believe that you consumed rather a generous amount of Romulan ale in the officers mess on the night in question.
- Objection.
- Sustained.
We all did.
All of us.
That doesn't mean...
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
Barely.
Now be careful, Doctor.
Have you ever in your past saved patients as barely alive as he?
I didn't have the medical knowledge I needed for Klingon anatomy.
- I see.
- You where there.
You say you are due for retirement.
May I ask, do your hands shake?
- Objection!
- I was nervous.
No.
You were incompetent.
You were incompetent!
Whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink.
- The court will have to determine.
- My God, man.
I tried to save him!
I tried to save him.
I was desperate to save him.
He was the last best hope in the Universe for peace.
The witness is excused.
There we have it, citizens.
We have established the particulars of the crime.
And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair.
James Tiberius Kirk.
What would your favourite author say, Captain?
"Let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings."
Tell us your sad story, Kirk.
Tell us that you planned to take revenge for the death of your son.
- That's not true.
- Objection!
Captain Kirk has not been identified as the assassin.
I offer into the record this excerpt from the Captain's personal log.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I've never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Again!
Again!
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I've never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Are those your words?
Those words were spoken by me.
Objection!
My client's political views are not on trial.
On the contrary.
Captain Kirk's views are at the very heart of the matter.
His record shows him to be an insubordinate, unprincipled opportunist with a history of violating the chain of command whenever it suited him.
Continue.
The record shows that Captain Kirk once held the rank of Admiral and he was broken for taking matters into his own hands.
Do you deny being demoted for these charges.
Answer me now!
- I cannot deny it.
- You were demoted?
- For insubordination?
- On occasion, I have disobeyed orders.
Were you obeying or disobeying orders when you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?
I didn't know about it until we boarded the ship.
You still deny the Enterprise fired on Kronos One?
And you still deny your men beamed aboard and shot the Chancellor?
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I didn't witness.
Are you aware that as the captain of a ship, you are responsible for the actions of your men?
I am.
If it's proved that members of your crew carried out the assassination...
- They're setting us up.
Your Honours!
- Do not answer.
Captain Kirk, you will answer the question.
As Captain I'm responsible for the crew under my command.
Your Honours, the state rests.
Send to Commander Enterprise.
"We stand ready to assist you.
Captain Sulu, U.S.S. Excelsior."
It is the determination of this court that the prisoners are guilty as charged.
I wish to note for the record that all the evidence is circumstantial.
I beg the court to consider this when pronouncing its sentence.
So noted.
Captain James T. Kirk, Dr. Leonard McCoy.
In the interest of fostering amity for the forthcoming peace talks, the sentence of death is commuted.
It is the judgement of this court that, without possibility of reprieve or parole, you be taken from this place to the dilithium mines on the penal asteroid of Rura Penthe.
There to spend the rest of your natural lives.
Rura Penthe!
Known throughout the galaxy as the alien's graveyard.
Better to kill them now and get it over with.
Lieutenant.
The torpedo hit once again, please.
Hold.
It is Enterprise.
We fired.
That is not possible!
All weapons visually accounted for, sir.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains must be the truth.
What does that mean?
That if we cannot have fired those torpedoes, someone else did.
They didn't fire on themselves and there are no other ships present.
- There was a neutron surge.
- Not from us.
A neutron surge that big could only be produced by another ship.
- Kronos One?
- Too far away.
Very near us.
Possibly beneath us.
If there were a ship beneath us, the Klingons would have seen it.
Would they?
- A Bird of Prey?
- A Bird of Prey.
- Cloaked?
- They can't fired when they're cloaked.
All things being equal, I would agree.
However, things are not equal.
This one can.
- We must inform Starfleet Command.
- Of what?
A new weapon that's invisible?
They'll call us raving lunatics.
They'll say we'll say anything to exonerate the Captain.
And they would be correct.
We have no evidence.
Only a theory which happens to fit the facts.
Assuming you're right.
Why would they fire on their own President?
Indeed.
This ship will be searched from bow to stern.
I do not understand.
If there was a ship underneath us surely the assassins beamed aboard from that vessel, not Enterprise.
You're forgetting something, Mr Chekov.
According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
If we did, the killers are here.
If we did not, whoever altered the data banks is here.
In either case, what we are looking for is here.
- What are we looking for, sir?
- Lieutenant.
Two pairs of gravity boots.
This is the gulag Rura Penthe.
There is no stockades, no guard tower, no electronic frontier.
Only a magnetic shield prevents beaming.
Punishment means exile from prison to the surface.
On the surface, nothing can survive.
Work well, and you will be treated well.
Work badly, and you will die.
Oh, my God!
The universal translator has been confiscated.
I'm sorry...?
He's definitely on about something, Jim.
If this is your spot, we'll move on.
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
- He's got it.
- And your coat.
I'm afraid not.
It wouldn't fit.
- Thanks.
- This will help keep you warm.
- I'm Martia.
You're Kirk and McCoy.
- How did you know that?
We don't get many presidential assassins.
- We didn't kill Gorkon.
- Of course not.
- But there's a reward for your death.
- That figures.
We've been set up.
Somebody up there wants you out of the way.
- Any progress?
- None.
A crew of 300 are looking everywhere, but the killers may still be among them.
Surely they have disposed of these boots by now.
Would it not have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
Logic must give way to physics.
Gravity wasn't restored when they escaped.
Without the boots, they would have floated off the transporter pads.
Why not simply vaporize them?
Like this?
As you know, no one can fire an unauthorized phaser aboard a starship.
Suppose, when they returned, they threw the boots into the refuse.
I'm having the refuse searched.
If I'm correct, those boots will cling to the killer's necks like Tiberian bats.
They couldn't escape without them nor throw them out the window.
Those boots are here.
Somewhere.
- Did someone fire off a phaser?
- It's alright.
It's nothing.
Mr Spock, Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
- Who fired the...
- Ah, Mr Scott.
I hear you have difficulty with the warp drive.
How long do you need for repair?
There's nothing wrong with the bloody thing.
If we return to space dock, the killers can dispose of their footwear and we will never see the Captain or Dr. McCoy alive again.
- It could take weeks.
- Thank you.
Val'eris, inform Starfleet our warp drive is inoperative.
- A lie?
- An error.
We have lost all contact with the Captain and Dr. McCoy.
Yes, at the moment they're surrounded by a magnetic shield.
But if I know the Captain, he is deep into planning his escape.
You've got him where you want him, Jim!
- Are you alright?
- I think so.
- They'll respect you now.
- I was lucky that thing had knees.
That was not his knee.
Not everybody keep their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Anything you want to tell me?
See what you can do for him.
Let him know we're not holding a grudge.
Suppose he's holding a grudge?
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
- Do you want to get out of here?
- There's got to be a way.
Three months before retirement.
What a way to finish.
- We're not finished.
- Speak for yourself.
One day, one night...
Kobayashi Maru!
Bones!
Are you afraid of the future?
I believe that was the general idea that I was trying to convey.
- I don't mean this future.
- What is this - multiple choice?
Some people are afraid...
of what might happen.
- I was terrified.
- What terrified you, specifically?
No more neutral zone.
I was used to hating Klingons.
It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his words.
- Spock was right.
- We all felt exactly the same.
No.
Somebody felt a lot worse.
I'm beginning to understand why.
If you've got any bright ideas, now is the time.
Time is the problem.
You and I are nothing.
You heard the judge - the peace conference is on again.
Whoever killed Gorkon is bound to attempt another assassination.
Unless we can get out of here.
It's me
- Martia.
Listen.
No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
- Except us.
- It is possible.
I know how to get outside the shield.
- How do we fit in?
- Getting outside the shield is easy.
After that, you have to get us off the surface before we freeze.
Can you?
- It's possible.
- I can't make it alone.
You're the likeliest candidate to come here for months.
Candidate for what?
Go to lift 7 in the morning for mining duty.
I'll see you there.
Don't disappoint me.
- What is it with you, anyway?
- Still think we're finished?
More than ever.
Sorry to wake you, sir.
Starfleet requests any data we have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
What?
They're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to space dock, sir.
Signal Starfleet that we have no idea location Enterprise.
- Sir?
- You have hearing problems?
No, sir.
Klingon blood.
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
This is the first evidence which corroborates our theory.
Now we go to Starfleet?
We expand our search to include uniforms.
All uniforms?
Clear, sir.
Make a hole.
Coming through.
Coming through.
Sir!
Sir!
- I think we've been had.
- No, you weren't, Doctor.
Get off at the first level.
Follow the gang into the mine.
They don't take girls.
- You are crewman Dax?
- Yes.
What is the problem?
Perhaps you know Russian epic of Cinderella?
If shoe fits - wear it.
Mr Chekov...
Watch me.
What kind of creature is this?
Last night you two were...
Get in.
Come on.
We don't have a lot of time.
Hurry!
Up there.
Come on - climb!
Here, you'll need these.
Quickly!
Stay close.
- There they are.
- They emerge from the beaming shield.
Mr Scott, start your engines.
Mr Chekov, set course for Rura Penthe.
Mr Spock, Rura Penthe is deep inside the Klingon frontier.
- If we're discovered...
- Correct.
We need a feat of linguistic legerdemain and intrepidity before the Captain and Dr. McCoy freeze to death.
- Leave me, I'm finished.
- No!
Bones, I'm wearing a viridium patch on my back.
Spock slapped it there before we went on Gorkon's ship.
That cunning little Vulcan.
Come on!
We're in the clear.
Now that we're outside the shield, they can locate us two sectors away.
If they're even looking for us.
This is listening post Morska.
What ship is that, over?
We must respond.
A universal translator would be recognised.
We am thy freighter...
Ursva.
Six weeks out of Kronos.
"What is your destination, over? "
We is condemning food things and supplies.
Don't catch any bugs.
Would you mind explaining that little trick you do?
- I'm a Chameloid.
- I've heard about you.
Shape-shifters.
I thought you were mythical.
Give a girl a chance, Captain.
It takes a lot of effort.
I don't doubt it.
Stop me if I'm wrong, but do we have any way of knowing whether this is the real you?
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.
We're outside the shield.
Now it's your turn, Captain.
If you say so.
Are you crazy?
!
She didn't need our help.
Where did you get these convenient clothes?
Don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue.
It's to let them know where we are.
Ask her what she's getting in return.
A full pardon... which doesn't cover this.
An accident wasn't good enough.
Come on, Spock.
Good enough for one.
Two would have looked suspicious.
Killed while attempting escape.
That's convincing for both.
Surprise!
- Your friends are late.
- They'll be along.
- I can't believe I kissed you.
- Must have been your lifelong ambition.
Isn't it time you became something else?
I like it here.
Well, well, well...
What took you so long?
Kill him, he's the one.
Not me, you idiot - him!
- No witnesses.
- Killed while trying to escape.
- Damned clever, if you ask me.
- It's a classic.
- That's what he wanted.
- Who?
Who wanted us killed?
Since you're all going to die anyway, why not tell you?
His name is...
Damn it!
What the hell!
Son of a...!
Couldn't you have waited two seconds?
He was about to explain the whole thing.
- You want to go back?
- Absolutely not!
This is the bridge.
We're still in Klingon space.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
They were beamed aboard a Federation Starship.
I could trace...
Escaped.
Kirk cannot know the location of the peace conference.
Are you sure?
Will you take that chance?
Helmsman, make course to intercept Enterprise.
The Klingons have a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked.
- She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
- So that's it.
We believe that Gorkon's murderers are aboard this ship.
- Has the peace conference begun?
- Who knows?
The location is secret.
- There's always something.
- Captain!
Mr Spock!
I found the uniforms with the Klingon blood on them.
But the uniforms belong to these two men.
Burke and Samno.
Not anymore.
Phaser on "stun" at close range.
First rule of assassination - kill the assassins.
- Now we're back to square one.
- Can I talk to you?
- Why weren't they vaporized?
- It would set off the alarm.
It's possible.
Now hear this.
Now hear this.
Court reporter to sick bay.
Code blue - urgent.
Statements to be taken at once from Yeomen Burke and Samno.
Repeat, court reporter to sick bay.
Code blue - urgent.
Statements to be taken.
Repeat, statements to be taken from Yeomen Burke and Samno.
You have to shoot.
If you are logical, you have to shoot.
- I do not want to.
- What you want is irrelevant.
What you've chosen is at hand.
I'd just as soon you didn't.
The operation is over.
I did not fire.
You cannot prove anything.
Yes, I can.
At my trial my personal log was used against me.
How long did you wait outside my quarters before I noticed you?
You knew?
I tried to tell you, but you would not listen.
Neither of us was hearing very well that night.
There were things I tried to tell you, about having faith.
You have betrayed the Federation.
All of you.
- And what have you've been doing?
- Saving Starfleet.
Klingons cannot be trusted.
Sir...
You said so yourself.
They killed your son.
Did you not wish Gorkon dead?
"Let them die", you said.
Did I misinterpret you?
And you were right.
They conspired with us to assassinate their own Chancellor.
How trustworthy can they be?
Klingons and Federation members conspiring together.
- Who is "us"?
- All who stands to lose from peace.
Names, Lieutenant.
My comrades will make certain all your transmissions are jammed.
- Names, Lieutenant!
- I do not remember.
A lie?
A choice.
Spock.
Admiral Cartwright.
From Starfleet?
Who else?
General...
Chang.
- Who else?
- Romulan Ambassador and others.
Where is the peace conference?
Where is the peace conference?
She does not know.
Then we're dead.
I have been dead before.
Contact Excelsior.
- She'll have the co-ordinates.
- I've already got it, sir.
- Standing by, Captain Kirk.
- Sulu.
You realize that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations.
I'm sorry, Captain.
Yourmessage is breaking up.
Bless you, Sulu.
Where is the peace conference?
They'll attempt another assassination.
It's at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border.
I'm sending the co-ordinates on a coded frequency.
We'll need more than that.
There's a Bird of Prey on the look-out for us that can fire when cloaked.
Surely not.
How many of those things are there?
Come on, Lieutenant.
- Just the prototype.
- Do you hear that?
I'm getting under way now.
We're in Alpha Quadrant.
The chances of our reaching the conference in time are slim.
- When does this conference start?
- According to my information - today.
- Thank you, Captain Sulu.
- Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
Spock?
I prefer it dark.
- Dining on ashes?
- You were right.
It was arrogant presumption on my part that got us into this situation.
You and the Doctor might have been killed.
The night is young.
You said it yourself, it was logical.
Peace is worth a few personal risks.
You're a great one for logic.
I'm a great one for rushing in where angels fear to tread.
We're both extremists.
Reality is probably somewhere in between.
I couldn't get past the death of my son.
I was prejudiced by her accomplishments as a Vulcan.
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was.
Is it possible that we two, you and I, have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?
Would that constitute a joke?
- It wasn't your fault.
- I was responsible.
- For no actions but your own.
- That's not what you said at your trial.
That was as captain of the ship.
Human beings...
We both know that I am not human.
Do you want to know something?
Everybody's human.
I find that remark... insulting.
Come, I need you.
Madam Chancellor, members of the diplomatic corps honoured guests.
The United Federation of Planets welcomes you to Camp Khitomer.
She's out here somewhere.
- But if she's cloaked...
- Then all we have is a radiation surge.
By the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes.
2.06... 2.03...
- Close enough to beam down?
- Not yet.
In two minutes. 1 .58.
Go to impulse power for Khitomer.
Let us redefine progress to mean that just because we can do a thing it does not necessarily follow that we must do that thing.
- Uhura?
- Nothing, Captain.
If she's here, she's rigged for silent running.
Coming up on transporter range in 57 seconds.
Transporter room.
Stand by to beam down.
53... 48 seconds.
44...
I can see you, Kirk.
Chang.
Can you see me?
Now be honest, Captain.
Warrior to warrior.
You do prefer it this way, don't you?
As it was meant to be.
No peace in our time.
"Once more unto the breach, dearfriends. "
- This is fun.
- Reverse engines.
All astern.
One and a half impulse power.
Back off!
What's she doing?
What's she waiting for?
Probably attempting to ascertain why we are reversing.
Wondering whether we detect her.
Incoming!
- In range?
- Not yet, sir.
Come on!
- She'll fly apart.
- Fly her apart, then!
Many speculated about my father's motives.
Some said he was an idealist.
Others said he had no choice.
If Praxis had not exploded, his idealism wouldn't have found expression.
We are a proud race.
We are here because we intend to go on being proud.
- Go to auxiliary power!
- Auxiliary circuits destroyed.
"Tickle us, do we not laugh?
Prick us, do we not bleed?"
"Wrong us, shall we not revenge?"
Gas.
Gas, Captain.
Under impulse power she expands fuel, like all vessels.
We call it "plasma", but it is merely ionised gas.
What about our equipment to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
The thing's got to have a tail-pipe.
Doctor, would you assist me in performing surgery on a torpedo?
Fascinating.
Hard to starboard.
The proposed agenda is as follows:
The evacuation of Kronos has been calculated within the 50 Earth year time span.
Phase 1 - preparation for evacuation...
Captain, she's packing quite a wallop.
Shields weakening.
Shields up!
Alright, now we're giving them something else to shoot at.
The game's afoot.
- Excelsior's been hit!
- "Our revels now are ended", Kirk.
"Cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war."
- Bones, where's my torpedo?
- Bet you wished you'd stayed in bed.
Shields collapsing!
The key, please.
Time is short.
- The hull has been compromised.
- I wonder how bad.
Connect echo-bars.
...discuss the report on phase 2.
- Alter circuit A.
- Sensor.
...we commence within minutes of the preparation.
- "I am constant as the Northern star."
- I'd give real money, if he'd shut up.
Plate, please.
...and assimilation will consume...
We've got a heart beat.
...with the Klingon Empire...
Key, please.
- Where's that torpedo?
- She's ready.
Lock and load!
Fire!
"To be... or not" "to be."
Target that explosion and fire.
Fire!
This work will occupy us throughout most of the week.
I hope that the delegation can implement the provisions of Phase 1 by the first of next month.
As you know, time is of the essence.
Out of the way!
Mr President!
Mr President!
Kirk, Enterprise.
Protect the Chancellor!
- Arrest those men!
- Arrest yourself!
We've got a full confession.
- This is not Klingon blood.
- Cartwright.
Just a minute.
It's Colonel West!
What's happened?
What's the mean of all of this?
It's about the future, Madam Chancellor.
Some people think the future means the end of history.
We haven't run out of history quite yet.
Your father called the future "the undiscovered country".
People can be very frightened of change.
You've restored my father's faith.
And you've restored my son's.
Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
And they're not going to prosecute.
They could have prosecuted me.
I felt like Val'eris.
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
And it's a good thing, too.
If they did, we'd all have to turn ourselves in.
- Captain Kirk.
- Captain Sulu.
As much to the crew of the Enterprise, I owe you my thanks.
Nice to see you in action one more time, Captain Kirk.
Take care.
- My God, that's a big ship.
- Not so big as her captain.
So...
This is goodbye?
It's about time we got underway ourselves.
Captain, I have orders from Starfleet Command.
We're to put back to space dock immediately... to be decommissioned.
If I were human, I believe my response would be:
"Go to hell."
If I were human.
Course heading, Captain?
Second star to the right.
And straight on 'til morning.
Captain's log, stardate 9529. 1.
This is the final cruise of the Starship Enterprise under my command.
This ship, and her history will shortly become the care of another crew.
To them and their posterity will we commit our future.
They'll continue the voyages we have begun and journey to all the undiscovered countries boldly going where no man, where no one has gone before.
Stardate 9521.6.
Captain's Log, U.S.S. Excelsior.
Hikaru Sulu commanding.
After three years,
I've concluded my first assignment as master of this vessel, cataloguing gaseous planetary anomalies in Beta Quadrant.
We're heading home under full impulse power.
I am pleased to report that ship and crew have functioned well.
According to this, we've completed our survey of the entire sector.
I have an energy wave at 240 degrees mark 6 port, sir.
Visual.
My God.
Shields.
Shields!
She's not answering her helm.
Starboard thruster.
Turn her into the wave.
Aye.
Quarter impulse power.
Damage report.
Checking all systems, Captain.
Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
Negative, sir.
The subspace shockwave originated at bearing 3-2-3 mark 75.
Location...
It's Praxis, sir.
It's a Klingon moon.
Praxis is their key energy production facility.
Send to Klingon High Command.
"This is Excelsior, a Federation starship.
"We have monitored a large explosion in your sector.
"Do you require assistance?"
-Aye, sir.
-Mr.
Valtane, any more data?
Yes, sir.
I've confirmed the location of Praxis, but...
What is it?
I cannot confirm the existence of Praxis.
Onscreen.
Magnify.
Computer enhancement.
-Praxis?
-What's left of it, sir.
Captain, I'm getting a message from Praxis.
Let's have it.
This is Brigadier Kerla speaking for the High Command.
There has been an incident on Praxis.
However, everything is under control.
We have no need for assistance.
Obey treaty stipulations and remain outside the neutral zone.
This transmission ends now.
"An incident"?
-Do we report this, sir?
-Are you kidding?
What are we doing here?
Maybe they're throwing us a retirement party.
-That suits me.
I just bought a boat.
-This had better be good.
I'm supposed to be chairing a seminar at the Academy.
Captain, isn't this just for top brass?
If we're all here, where's Sulu?
Captain Sulu.
On assignment.
Where's Spock?
This briefing is classified.
Ladies and gentlemen, the CinC.
As you were.
To break this information down succinctly, the Klingon Empire has roughly 50 years of life left to it.
For full details, I'm turning this briefing over to the Federation's special envoy.
Good morning.
Two months ago, a Federation starship monitored an explosion on the Klingon moon Praxis.
We believe it was caused by over-mining and insufficient safety precautions.
The moon's decimation means the deadly pollution of their ozone.
They will have depleted their supply of oxygen in approximately 50 Earth years.
Due to their enormous military budget, the Klingon economy does not have the resources with which to combat this catastrophe.
Last month, at the behest of the Vulcan ambassador,
I opened a dialogue with Gorkon, Chancellor of the Klingon High Council.
He proposes to commence negotiations at once.
Negotiations for what?
The dismantling of our space stations and starbases along the neutral zone, an end to almost 70 years of unremitting hostility, which the Klingons can no longer afford.
Bill, are we talking about mothballing the Starfleet?
Well, I'm sure that our exploration and scientific programs
-would be unaffected, Captain, but...
-I must protest.
To offer Klingons safe haven within Federation space is suicide.
Klingons would become the alien trash of the galaxy, and if we dismantle the fleet, we'd be defenseless before an aggressive species with a foothold on our territory.
The opportunity here is to bring them to their knees.
Then we'll be in a far better position to dictate terms.
Sir?
Captain Kirk.
The Klingons have never been trustworthy.
I'm forced to agree with Admiral Cartwright.
This is a terrifying idea.
It is imperative that we act now to support the Gorkon initiative lest more conservative elements persuade his empire that it is better to attempt a military solution and die fighting.
You, Captain Kirk, are to be our first olive branch.
We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon vessel which is bringing Chancellor Gorkon to Earth and to escort him safely through Federation space.
Me?
Well, there are Klingons who feel the same way about the peace treaty as yourself and Admiral Cartwright, but they'll think twice about attacking the Enterprise under your command.
I have personally vouched for you in this matter, Captain.
You have personally vouched?
You will extend Chancellor Gorkon full diplomatic courtesy, Captain Kirk.
But a full ambassador would be better equipped...
If there's no further business,
I wish you and your crew Godspeed.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
I remind you, this meeting is classified.
I don't know whether to congratulate you or not, Jim.
I wouldn't.
We volunteered?
There is an old Vulcan proverb, "Only Nixon could go to China."
How could you vouch for me?
That's arrogant presumption.
My father requested that I open negotiations...
I know your father's the Vulcan ambassador, for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this.
They're animals.
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here.
Don't believe them.
Don't trust them.
-They are dying.
-Let them die.
Has it occurred to you that this crew is due to stand down in three months?
We've done our bit for king and country.
You should have trusted me.
Control, this is SD-103, approach to spacedock.
Over.
SD-103, you are clear to deliver Captain Kirk and party to NCC-1701 Alpha.
Over.
Captain on the Bridge.
-As you were, Lieutenant...
-Valeris, sir.
We were told that you needed a helmsman, so I volunteered.
Lieutenant, it is agreeable to see you again.
Lieutenant was the first Vulcan to be graduated
-at the top of her class at the academy.
-You must be very proud.
I don't believe so, sir.
She's a Vulcan, all right.
Let's get this over with.
Departure stations.
-Scotty.
-Aye, sir?
Did you find the engine room?
Right where I left it, sir.
Standby.
Uhura, get me the dockmaster.
Control tower reading, sir.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
This is Control, Enterprise.
Permission to depart granted.
Thirty seconds for port gates.
Clear all moorings.
Awaiting port gates from this mark.
All moorings clear.
Aft thrusters.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
One-quarter impulse power.
Captain, may I remind you that regulations specify thrusters only while in spacedock?
Jim?
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
Aye, sir.
Captain's Log, Stardate 9522.6.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I could never forgive them for the death of my boy.
It seems to me our mission to escort the Chancellor of the Klingon High Council to a peace summit is problematic at best.
Spock says this could be an historic occasion, and I'd like to believe him, but how on earth can history get past people like me?
Sorry.
You could have knocked.
We are almost at the rendezvous, sir.
I thought that you would like to know.
Right.
Permission to speak freely, sir.
It is an honor to serve with you.
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant.
I've always wanted to try that, sir.
You've done well, Valeris.
As your sponsor at the academy,
I have followed your career with satisfaction, and as a Vulcan, you've exceeded my expectations.
I do not understand this representation.
It is a depiction from ancient Earth mythology, the expulsion from Paradise.
Why keep it in your quarters?
It is a reminder to me that all things end.
It is of endings that I wish to speak.
Sir, I address you as a kindred intellect.
Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
History is replete with turning points, Lieutenant.
-You must have faith.
-Faith?
That the universe will unfold as it should.
-But is that logical?
Surely we must...
-Logic, logic and logic.
Logic is the beginning of wisdom, Valeris, not the end.
This will be my final voyage onboard this vessel as a member of her crew.
Nature abhors a vacuum.
I intend you to replace me.
I could only succeed you, sir.
Now hear this.
All officers to the Bridge.
Klingon battle cruiser off the port bow.
All officers to the Bridge.
Captain on the Bridge.
Shall we raise our shields, Captain?
Never been this close.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
-Uhura, hailing frequencies.
-Aye, sir.
Right standard rudder.
Bring us alongside.
Right standard rudder.
Z plus 5 degrees.
Channel is open, Captain.
This is the Starship Enterprise,
Captain James T. Kirk commanding.
This is Kronos One.
I am Chancellor Gorkon.
Chancellor, we've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting on Earth.
Thank you, Captain.
Would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard the Enterprise with my officers, as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We would be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
I shall look forward to that.
-Well, I hope you're happy.
-Captain, there is a supply of Romulan ale aboard.
It might make the evening pass more smoothly.
Officer thinking, Lieutenant.
Guess who's coming to dinner.
Energize.
-Chancellor Gorkon.
-Captain Kirk.
May I present Captain Spock, whom I believe you know.
Captain, face to face at last.
-You have my thanks.
-Chancellor.
Gentlemen, this is my daughter Azetbur,
my military adviser, Brigadier Kerla, and this is General Chang, my chief of staff.
I have so wanted to meet you, Captain.
I'm not sure how to take that.
Sincere admiration, Kirk.
From one warrior to another.
Right.
This way.
I think you might enjoy a brief tour.
-They all look alike.
-What about that smell?
You know only top-of-the-line models can even talk...
You men have work?
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.
Then snap to it.
I offer a toast.
"The undiscover'd country,"
the future.
-"The undiscover'd country." -"The undiscover'd country."
Hamlet, Act III, Scene 1.
You've not experienced Shakespeare until you have read him in the original Klingon.
Captain Kirk, I thought Romulan ale was illegal.
One of the advantages of being 1,000 light-years from Federation Headquarters.
To you, Chancellor Gorkon, one of the architects of our future.
-Chancellor.
-Chancellor.
Perhaps we are looking at something of that future here.
Tell me, Captain Kirk, would you be willing to give up Starfleet?
I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace.
Far be it for me to dispute my first officer, but Starfleet has always been at the fore...
Captain, there's no need to mince words.
In space, all warriors are cold warriors.
General, are you fond of
Shakespeare?
We do believe all planets have a sovereign claim to inalienable human rights.
Inalien?
If you could only hear yourselves.
"Human rights."
Why, the very name is racist.
The Federation is no more than a "Homo Sapiens Only" club.
Present company excepted, of course.
In any case, we know where this is leading.
-The annihilation of our culture.
-That's not true.
-No?
-No.
"To be, or not to be."
That is the question which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk.
-We need breathing room.
-Earth, Hitler, 1938.
I beg your pardon?
Well...
I see we have a long way to go.
We must do this again sometime.
You don't trust me, do you?
I don't blame you.
If there is to be a brave new world, our generation is going to have the hardest time living in it.
Captain Spock.
Chancellor.
-Madam.
-Captain.
Well, most kind.
"Parting is such sweet sorrow," Captain.
Have we not "heard the chimes at midnight"?
Thank God.
Did you see the way they ate?
Terrible table manners.
I doubt that our own behavior will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy.
I'm going to sleep this off.
Please let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight.
I'm going to go find a pot of black coffee.
The Enterprise hosted Chancellor Gorkon and company to dinner last night.
Our manners weren't exactly Emily Post.
Note to the galley,
Romulan ale no longer to be served at diplomatic functions.
Captain Kirk, will you please join me on the Bridge?
Captain Kirk?
-Captain.
-What is it?
I find this curious.
Spock, I'm really tired.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
Where?
Strangely enough, it appears to be emanating from us.
The Enterprise?
Valeris, do you know anything about a radiation surge?
Sir?
Chekov?
Only the size of my head.
I know what you mean.
-What's happened?
-We have fired on the Chancellor's ship.
Torpedo Room, please confirm.
Have we fired?
...0-6...
-Uhura, monitor.
-Aye, sir.
Direct hit.
Confirmed, sir.
We've lost gravity!
We are betrayed!
This is the Bridge.
Do you read?
Do you read?
Torpedo bay, did we fire those torpedoes?
Negative, Captain.
According to inventory, we're still fully loaded.
Find Chang.
Unable to confirm or deny firing of two photon torpedoes.
-Hailing frequencies.
-Aye, sir.
Kronos One, this is Enterprise.
Do you read?
Over.
Repeat.
Kronos One...
It's very hard to make out, Captain.
There's been some weapons firing and a lot of shouting.
She is still listing.
She's spinning out of control.
Restoring auxiliary gravity.
Have you not a shred of decency in you, Kirk?
We come in peace, and you blatantly defile that peace.
For that, I shall blow you out of the stars.
-We haven't fired.
-Captain.
According to our databanks, we have, twice.
Captain, they're coming about.
-They're preparing to fire.
-Shields up, Captain?
-Captain, our shields.
-Shields up, Captain?
-Signal our surrender.
-Captain?
We surrender!
-This is Enterprise.
We surrender.
-If they fire at us
-with our shields down...
-I repeat.
-We surrender.
-...we will not be able to respond.
Repeat.
Enterprise surrenders.
-Are we firing torpedoes?
-I wish I knew.
Well, it sure looks like it.
I'm going aboard.
Spock, you have the conn.
I am responsible for involving you in this.
I will go.
No, I'll go.
You'll be responsible for getting me out of this.
We'll not be the instigators of full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
I'm going, too.
They may need a doctor.
-Perhaps you're right.
-Uhura, tell them we're coming, and tell them we're unarmed.
Aye, sir.
Have you lost your mind?
I give you my word, I don't understand what has happened.
We're here to help.
Follow me.
-Chancellor Gorkon.
-My God.
-What has happened here?
-You dare to feign ignorance?
-What happened?
-With a direct torpedo hit, you crippled our entire gravitational field, and two of your Starfleet crew beamed aboard wearing magnetic boots and did this.
Aren't you carrying a surgeon?
We were until this disgrace.
Well, then for God sakes, man, let me help.
I've got a pulse.
We can move him.
I'm gonna need some light.
Can we get him up on this table?
Hold him.
Hold him while I stabilize him.
I said hold him.
Sweet Jesus.
-Can you...
-Jim, I don't even know his anatomy.
-His wounds are not closing.
-He's killing him!
He's gone into some kind of damned arrest.
Come on, damn it!
Come on!
He's not responding.
Don't let it end this way, Captain.
Under article number 184 of your interstellar law,
I'm placing you under arrest.
You are charged with assassinating our Chancellor of the High Council.
He tried to save him.
They've been arrested.
Mr. Spock, we've got to do something.
I assume command of this ship as of 0230 hours.
Commander Uhura, please notify Starfleet Headquarters.
Tell them precisely what has taken place
-and request instructions.
-Aye, sir.
We cannot allow them to be taken back to Kronos as prisoners.
What do you suggest, Lieutenant?
Opening fire will not retrieve them, and an armed conflict is precisely what the Captain wished to avoid.
We will be able to follow the Captain's movements.
-How did you achieve this, sir?
-Time is precious, Lieutenant.
We must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight.
According to our databank, this ship fired those torpedoes.
No way.
I sympathize, Mr. Scott, but we need evidence.
Please accompany me.
And if we cannot piece together what happened?
-What then, sir?
-In that case, Mr. Chekov, it resides in the purview of the diplomats.
The Chancellor of the High Council is dead!
The result of an unprovoked attack while he travelled to see you under a flag of truce, on a mission of peace.
Captain Kirk was legally arrested for the crime.
May I remind you that he and Dr McCoy boarded Kronos One of their own free will?
None of these facts are in dispute, Mr. President.
I have ordered a full-scale investigation.
-In the meantime...
-In the meantime, we expect the Federation to abide by the articles of interstellar law, which you claim to cherish.
Kirk and Dr McCoy will stand trial for the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon.
Out of the question.
Ambassador Sarek, there must be some way to extradite these men.
Mr. President, I share a measure of personal responsibility in this matter, but I am obliged to confirm my esteemed colleague's legal interpretation.
What is the position of the Romulan government,
Ambassador Nanclus?
I must concur with my colleagues.
But you can't possibly believe that James Kirk assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council.
Mr. President, I don't know what to believe.
I'm waiting for your answer, sir.
This president is not above the law.
Report back at once.
Do you copy?
At once.
Enterprise to report back on the double.
Do you read?
At once.
We're to report back at once.
We cannot abandon Captain Kirk and Dr McCoy.
Of course not.
Four hundred years ago on the planet Earth, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by automation flung their wooden shoes called "sabot" into the machines to stop them.
Hence the word "sabotage."
We are experiencing technical malfunction.
All backup systems inoperative.
Excellent.
I mean, too bad.
Mr. President,
I've been named Chancellor by the High Council in my father's place.
Madam Chancellor, you have my sincerest condolences on your recent loss.
I want to assure you that this shameful deed will not...
Mr. President, let us come to the point.
You want this conference to go forward, and so did my father.
I will attend in one week on one condition.
We will not extradite the prisoners, and you will make no attempt to rescue them in a military operation.
We would consider any such attempt an act of war.
We hope you'll be our guest here on Earth.
After recent events, you will understand if I say I prefer a neutral site, and in the interests of security, let us keep the location secret for now.
As you wish, Madam Chancellor.
Attack them now, while we still can!
Attack or be slaves in their world.
We can take whole by force, what they propose to divide.
War is obsolete, General, as we are in danger of becoming.
Better to die on our feet than live on our knees.
That wasn't what my father wanted.
Your father was killed for what he wanted.
The peace process will go forward.
Kirk...
Kirk will pay for my father's death.

The Enterprise fired on Kronos One without provocation.
The Chancellor and his advisers having been lulled into a false sense of security by an invitation to a state dinner aboard Captain Kirk's vessel at precisely 1930 hours that same evening.
Call your first witness.
After the first shot, we lost our gravitational field.
I found myself weightless and unable to function.
Then two Starfleet crewmen came walking towards me.
But perhaps they merely wore Starfleet uniforms.
That remark is purely speculative.
I move that it be stricken.
Colonel Worf, we are interested in facts, not theories.
If the gravitational unit was not functioning, how could these men be walking?
They appeared to be wearing magnetic boots.
Gravity boots.
Dr McCoy, would you be so good as to tell me, what is your current medical status?
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
You have a singular wit, Doctor.
For 27 years, I've been ship surgeon aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.
In three months, I stand down.
You know, I believe that you consumed a rather generous amount of Romulan ale in the officers' mess on the night in question.
Am I right, Doctor?
-Objection!
-Sustained.
We all did.
All of us.
-That doesn't mean...
-Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
-Barely.
-Now be careful, Doctor.
Have you ever, in your past, saved patients as barely alive as he?
I didn't have the medical knowledge I needed for Klingon anatomy.
-I see.
-You were there.
You say you are due for retirement.
May I ask, do your hands shake?
-Objection!
-I was nervous.
No.
You were incompetent.
You were incompetent!
Whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink,
-the court will have to determine.
-My God, man!
I tried to save him!
I tried to save him.
I was desperate to save him.
He was the last best hope in the universe for peace.
The witness is excused.
There we have it, citizens.
We have finally established the particulars of the crime, and now we come to the architect of this tragic affair,
James Tiberius Kirk.
What would your favorite author say, Captain?
"Let us sit upon the ground
"and tell sad stories of the death of kings."
Tell us your sad story, Kirk.
Tell us that you planned to take revenge for the death of your son.
-That's not true.
-Objection!
Captain Kirk has not been identified as the assassin.
Sustained.
I offer into the record this excerpt from the Captain's personal log.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I have never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Again.
Again!
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I have never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Are those your words?
Those words were spoken by me.
Objection!
My client's political views are not on trial here.
On the contrary!
Captain Kirk's views and motives are indeed at the very heart of the matter.
This officer's record shows him to be an insubordinate, unprincipled, career-minded opportunist, with a history of violating the chain of command whenever it suited him!
Continue.
Indeed, the record shows that Captain Kirk once held the rank of Admiral, and that Admiral Kirk was broken for taking matters into his own hands in defiance of regulations of the law.
Do you deny being demoted for these charges?
Don't wait for the translation!
Answer me now!
I cannot deny it.
-You were demoted?
-Yes.
-For insubordination?
-On occasion, I have disobeyed orders.
And were you obeying or disobeying orders when you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?
I didn't know about the assassination until we boarded the ship.
You still deny the Enterprise fired on Kronos One?
-Well...
-Your Honors, please!
And you still deny your men beamed aboard and shot the Chancellor?
Objection!
I cannot confirm or deny actions I did not witness.
Captain Kirk, are you aware that as the captain of a starship, you are required to be responsible for the actions of your men?
I am.
And if it should be proved that members of your crew did, in fact, carry out such an assassination...
Jim, they're setting us up.
Your Honors...
Do not answer!
Captain Kirk, you will answer the question.
As captain,
I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
Your Honors, the State rests.
Send to Commander Enterprise.
"We stand ready to assist you.
Captain Sulu, U.S.S. Excelsior. "
It is the determination of this court that the prisoners are guilty as charged.
I wish to note for the record that the evidence against my clients is entirely circumstantial.
I beg the court to consider this when pronouncing its sentence.
So noted.
Captain James T. Kirk, Dr Leonard McCoy, in the interest of fostering amity for the forthcoming peace talks, the sentence of death is commuted.
It is the judgment of this court that, without possibility of reprieve or parole, you be taken from this place to the dilithium mines on the penal asteroid of Rura Penthe, there to spend the rest of your natural lives.
Rura Penthe?
Known throughout the galaxy as the aliens' graveyard.
Better to kill them now and get it over with.
Lieutenant, the torpedo hit once again, please.
Hold.
It is Enterprise.
-We fired.
-That is not possible.
All weapons visually accounted for, sir.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.
What exactly does that mean?
It means that if we cannot have fired those torpedoes, someone else did.
Well, they did not fire on themselves, and there were no other ships present.
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
Not from us!
A neutron surge that big could only be produced by another ship.
Kronos One?
Too far away.
Very near us.
Possibly beneath us.
If there were a ship beneath us, the Klingons would have seen her.
Would they?
-A bird-of-prey.
-A bird-of-prey.
Cloaked?
A bird-of-prey cannot fire when she's cloaked.
All things being equal, Mr. Scott, I would agree.
However, things are not equal.
This one can.
We must inform Starfleet Command.
Inform them of what, a new weapon that is invisible?
Raving lunatics, that's what they'll call us.
They'll say that we're so desperate to exonerate the Captain that we'll say anything.
And they would be correct.
We have no evidence, only a theory which happens to fit the facts.
Assuming you're right, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own president?
Indeed.
This ship will be searched from bow to stern.
Lieutenant Valeris, you'll be in charge.
-Aye, sir.
-I do not understand.
If there was a ship underneath us, surely the assassins beamed aboard from that vessel, not Enterprise.
You're forgetting something, Mr. Chekov.
According to our databanks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
If we did, the killers are here.
If we did not, whoever altered the databanks is here.
In either case, what we are looking for is here.
What are we looking for, sir?
Lieutenant?
Two pairs of gravity boots.
This is the gulag Rura Penthe.
There is no stockade, no guard tower, no electronic frontier.
Only a magnetic shield prevents beaming.
Punishment means exile from prison to the surface.
On the surface, nothing can survive.
Work well and you will be treated well.
Work badly and you will die.
Oh, my God.
The universal translator's been confiscated.
I'm sorry?
He's definitely on about something, Jim.
If this is your spot, we'll move on.
He wants your obedience to the brotherhood of aliens.
-He's got it.
-And your coat.
I'm afraid not.
Besides, it wouldn't fit.
Thanks.
This will help keep you warm.
I'm Martia.
You're Kirk and McCoy, I presume.
How'd you know that?
We don't get many presidential assassins.
-We didn't kill Gorkon.
-Of course not,
-but there is a reward for your death.
-It figures.
We've been set up all along.
Somebody up there wants you out of the way.
-Nothing in here.
-Nothing here.
-Any progress?
-None.
We have a crew of 300 turning their own quarters inside out, but the killers may still be among them.
Surely they have disposed of these boots by now.
Would it not have been logical to have left them on Gorkon's ship?
Even logic must give way to physics.
Gravity had not been restored by the time they escaped.
Without the boots, they would have floated off the Klingon transporter pads.
Why not simply vaporize them?
Like this?
At ease.
As you know, Commander Chekov, no one can fire an unauthorized phaser aboard a starship.
Suppose when they returned, they threw the boots into the refuse.
I'm having the refuse searched.
If my surmise is correct, those boots will cling to the killers' necks like a pair of Tiberian bats.
They could not make their escape without them, nor can they simply throw them out the window for all to see.
-Those boots are here somewhere.
-Did someone fire off a phaser?
It's all right.
It's nothing.
It's nothing.
Mr. Spock, Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
-Who fired that...
-Mr.
Scott.
I understand you're having difficulty with the warp drive.
How much time do you require for repair?
There's nothing wrong with the bloody thing.
Mr. Scott, if we return to spacedock, the assassins will surely find a way to dispose of their incriminating footwear, and we will never see the Captain or Dr McCoy alive again.
-It could take weeks, sir.
-Thank you, Mr. Scott.
Valeris, please inform Starfleet Command
-our warp drive is inoperative.
-A lie?
An error.
You understand we have lost all contact with the Captain and Dr McCoy.
Yes.
At the moment, they're surrounded by a magnetic shield.
However, if I know the Captain, by this time, he is deep into planning his escape.
You got him, Jim!
You got him where you want him!
-You all right, Jim?
-I think so.
-They'll respect you now.
-That's a comfort.
-I was lucky that thing had knees.
-That was not his knee.
Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Anything you want to tell me?
Bones, why don't you see what you can do for him?
Let him know we're not holding a grudge.
Suppose he's holding a grudge?
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
-Do you want to get out of here?
-There's gotta be a way.
Three months before retirement.
What a way to finish.
-We're not finished.
-No?
Speak for yourself.
One day, one night, Kobayashi Maru.
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
I believe that was the general idea that I was trying to convey.
I don't mean this future.
-What is this, multiple choice?
-Some people are afraid of what might happen.
I was terrified.
What terrified you, specifically?
No more neutral zone.
I was used to hating Klingons.
It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word.
Spock was right.
Try not to be too hard on yourself.
We all felt exactly the same.
No.
Somebody felt a lot worse.
I'm beginning to understand why.
Well, if you've got any bright ideas, now's the time.
Time's the problem.
You and I are nothing.
But you heard the judge.
The peace conference is on again.
Whoever killed Gorkon is bound to attempt another assassination.
Unless we can get out of here.
Kirk, it's me, Martia.
Listen, no one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
-Except us.
-It is possible.
-I know how to get outside the shield.
-How do we fit in?
Getting outside the shield is easy, but after that, it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze.
Can you?
-It's possible.
-I can't make it alone, and you're likeliest candidate to come in this hellhole for months.
Candidate for what?
Go to lift seven in the morning for mining duty.
I'll see you there.
Don't disappoint me.
-What is it with you, anyway?
-Still think we're finished?
More than ever.
-I'm sorry to wake you, sir.
-What is it?
Starfleet urgently requests any data we have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
What?
Well, apparently, they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
Signal Starfleet that we have no idea location Enterprise.
Sir?
-You have hearing problems, mister?
-No, sir.
Klingon blood.
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
This is the first evidence which corroborates our theory.
Now we go to Starfleet.
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
All uniforms?
Take those out.
-Continue scanning.
-Nothing, sir.
Clear, sir.
Coming through.
Coming through.
Computer well seven clear.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Okay, let's see what we got.
Nothing.
Nothing so far.
Sir!
Sir!
-I think we've been had.
-No, you weren't, Doctor.
Get off at the first level.
Follow the gang into the mine.
They don't take girls.
You are Crewman Dax?
Yes, Commander.
What is the problem?
Perhaps you know Russian epic of Cinderella?
If shoe fits, wear it.
Mr. Chekov.
Watch me.
What kind of creature is this?
Last night, you two were...
Don't remind me.
Get in.
Come on.
We don't have a lot of time.
Hurry.
Up there.
Come on, climb.
Here.
You'll need these.
Quickly!
Stay close.
There they are.
They're emerging from the beaming shield.
-Mr.
Scott, start your engines.
-Aye, aye, sir.
Mr. Chekov, set course for Rura Penthe.
Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe is deep inside the Klingon frontier.
-If we are discovered...
-Quite correct, Mr. Chekov.
What is required now is a feat of linguistic legerdemain and a degree of intrepidity before the Captain and Dr McCoy freeze to death.
-Leave me.
I'm finished.
-No!
Bones, I'm wearing a viridium patch on my back.
Spock slapped it there just before we went on Gorkon's ship.
-Why, that cunning little Vulcan.
-Come on.
We're in the clear.
Now that we're outside the shield, they'll be able to locate us two sectors away.
If they're even looking for us.
This is listening post Morska.
What ship is that?
Over.
We must respond personally.
A universal translator would be recognized.
We am thy freighter Ursva.
Six weeks out of
Kronos.
What is your destination?
Over.
We is condemning food,
things and supplies.
Don't catch any bugs!
Would you mind explaining that little trick you do?
-I'm a chameloid.
-I've heard about you.
Shapeshifters.
-I thought you were mythical.
-Give a girl a chance, Captain.
-It takes a lot of effort.
-I don't doubt it.
Stop me if I'm wrong, but do we have any way of knowing whether this is the real you?
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.
We're outside the shield.
Now it's your turn, Captain.
If you say so.
Are you crazy?
She didn't need our help getting anywhere.
Where'd you get these convenient clothes?
Don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue.
It's to let them know where we are.
Ask her what she's getting in return.
A full pardon, which doesn't cover this.
An accident wasn't good enough.
Come on, Spock.
Good enough for one.
Two would have looked suspicious.
Killed while attempting escape.
Now that's convincing for both.
Surprise!
-Your friends are late.
-They'll be along.
-I can't believe I kissed you.
-Must have been your lifelong ambition.
Isn't it about time you became something else?
I like it here.
Well, well, well.
What took you so long?
-Kill him.
He's the one.
-Not me, you idiot.
Him!
-No witnesses.
-Killed while trying to escape.
-Damn clever, if you ask me.
-It's a classic.
-That's what he wanted.
-Who?
Who wanted us killed?
Since you're all going to die anyway, why not tell you?
His name is...
Damn it to hell!
Of all the...
Son of a...
-Couldn't you have waited two seconds?
-Captain?
He was just about to explain the whole thing.
You want to go back?
-Absolutely not!
-It's cold.
This is the Bridge.
We are still in Klingon space.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
They were beamed aboard a Federation starship.
I could trace...
Escaped.
Kirk cannot know the location of the peace conference.
Are you sure?
Will you take that chance?
Helmsman, make course to intercept Enterprise.
The Klingons have a new weapon, a bird-of-prey that can fire when cloaked.
-She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
-So that's it.
Not entirely.
I have reason to believe that Gorkon's murderers
-are aboard this vessel.
-I have a thought about that.
Has the peace conference begun?
Who knows?
They're keeping the location secret.
-There's always something.
-Captain!
Mr. Spock!
I found the missing uniforms with the Klingon blood on them.
But the uniforms belong to these two men,
Burke and Samno.
Not anymore.
Phaser on stun at close range.
First rule of assassination, kill the assassins.
-Now we're back to square one.
-Can I talk to you?
I wonder why they weren't vaporized.
It would set off the alarm.
It's possible.
Now hear this.
Now hear this.
Court reporter to sickbay.
Code Blue.
Urgent.
Statements to be taken at once from yeomen Burke and Samno.
Repeat.
Court reporter to sickbay.
Code Blue.
Urgent.
Statements to be taken.
Repeat.
Statements to be taken from yeomen Burke and Samno.
You have to shoot.
If you are logical, you have to shoot.
I do not want to.
What you want is irrelevant.
What you've chosen is at hand.
I'd just as soon you didn't.
The operation is over.
I did not fire.
You cannot prove anything.
Yes, I can.
At my trial, my personal log was used against me.
How long did you wait outside my quarters before I noticed you?
You knew?
I tried to tell you, but you would not listen.
Neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant.
There were things I tried to tell you about having faith.
You have betrayed the Federation.
All of you.
And what do you think you've been doing?
Saving Starfleet.
Klingons cannot be trusted.
Sir.
You said so yourself.
They killed your son.
Did you not wish Gorkon dead?
"Let them die," you said.
Did I misinterpret you?
And you were right.
They conspired with us to assassinate their own chancellor.
How trustworthy can they be?
Klingons and Federation members conspiring together?
Who is "us"?
Everyone who stands to lose from peace.
-Names, Lieutenant.
-My comrades will make certain all your ship-to-shore transmissions are jammed.
Names, Lieutenant.
I do not remember.
A lie?
A choice.
Spock?
Admiral Cartwright.
From Starfleet?
Who else?
-General...
-General...
-...
Chang.
-...
Chang.
Who else?
-Romulan...
-Romulan...
-...
Ambassador...
-...
Ambassador...
-...
Nanclus.
-...
Nanclus.
Where is the peace conference?
Where is the peace conference?
She does not know.
Then we're dead.
I've been dead before.
Contact Excelsior.
-She'll have the coordinates.
-I've already got him, sir.
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
Sulu!
You realize that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations.
I'm sorry, Captain.
Your message is breaking up.
Bless you, Sulu.
Where is the peace conference?
They're going to attempt another assassination.
The conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border.
I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
I'm afraid we're gonna need more than that.
There's a bird-of-prey on the lookout for us, and she can fire while cloaked.
Surely not.
Hold on.
How many of those things are there?
Come on, Lieutenant.
-Just the prototype.
-You hear that?
I'm getting underway now, but we're now in Alpha Quadrant.
The chances of our reaching the conference in time are slim.
When does this conference start?
According to my information, today.
Thank you, Captain Sulu.
Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
Spock?
I prefer it dark.
Dining on ashes?
You were right.
It was arrogant presumption on my part that got us into this situation.
You and the doctor might have been killed.
The night is young.
You said it yourself.
It was logical.
Peace is worth a few personal risks.
You're a great one for logic.
I'm a great one for rushing in where angels fear to tread.
We're both extremists.
Reality is probably somewhere in between.
I couldn't get past the death of my son.
I was prejudiced by her accomplishments as a Vulcan.
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was.
Is it possible that we two, you and I, have grown so old and so inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?
Would that constitute a joke?
Don't crucify yourself.
It wasn't your fault.
I was responsible.
-For no actions but your own.
-That is not what you said at your trial.
That was as captain of the ship.
Human beings...
But, Captain, we both know that I am not human.
Spock, you want to know something?
Everybody's human.
I find that remark insulting.
Come on.
I need you.
Madam Chancellor, members of the Diplomatic Corps, honored guests,
the United Federation of Planets welcomes you to Camp Khitomer.
She's out here somewhere.
But if she is cloaked...
Then all we have is a neutron radiation surge, and by the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes.
209.
206.
203.
-Close enough to beam down?
-Not yet, Captain.
In two minutes. 158.
-Go to impulse power for Khitomer orbit.
-Aye, sir.
Let us redefine progress to mean that just because we can do a thing, it does not necessarily follow that we must do that thing.
-Uhura?
-Nothing, Captain.
If she's here, she's rigged for silent running.
Coming up on transporter range in 57 seconds.
Transporter Room, stand by to beam down.
...53 48 seconds.
...44...
I can see you, Kirk.
Chang.
Can you see me?
Now, be honest, Captain.
Warrior to warrior, you do prefer it this way, don't you?
As it was meant to be.
No peace in our time.
"Once more unto the breach, dear friends."
-This is fun.
-Reverse engines.
All astern.
One and a half impulse power.
Back off!
Back off!
What's she doing?
What's she waiting for?
Probably attempting to ascertain why we are reversing, wondering whether we detect her.
Incoming!
-In range?
-Not yet, sir.
Come on.
Come on.
-She'll fly apart.
-Fly her apart, then!
Many speculated about my father's motives.
There were those who said he was an idealist.
Others said he had no choice.
If Praxis had not exploded, then quite possibly his idealism would not have found expression.
We are a proud race, and we are here because we intend to go on being proud.
-Go to auxiliary power!
-Auxiliary circuits destroyed, Captain.
"Tickle us, do we not laugh?
Prick us, do we not bleed?
"Wrong us,
"shall we not revenge?"
Gas.
Gas, Captain.
Under impulse power, she expends fuel like any other vessel.
We call it plasma, but whatever the Klingon designation, it is merely ionized gas.
Well, what about all of that equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
-Well, the thing's gotta have a tailpipe.
-Doctor, would you care to assist me
-in performing surgery on a torpedo?
-Fascinating.
Hard to starboard!
The proposed agenda is as follows.
The total evacuation of Kronos has been calculated within the 50-Earth-year time span.
Phase one, preparation for evacuation.
Come on, reach up!
Captain!
She's packing quite a wallop!
Shields weakening!
Shields up.
All right.
Now we've given them something else to shoot at.
Aye, sir.
The game's afoot, huh?
-Excelsior's been hit.
-"Our revels now are ended," Kirk.
"Cry 'Havoc!
' and let slip the dogs of war."
Bones, where's my torpedo?
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed.
Emergency power!
Gravity control down!
Shields collapsing!
The key, please, Doctor.
Time is short.
The hull has been compromised.
-I wonder how bad?
-Connect echobars.
...to discuss the report on phase two.
-Alter circuit "A."
-Sensor.
I propose that we commence with the minutes of the preparation.
"I am constant as the northern star."
I'd give real money if he'd shut up.
-Plate, please.
-Plate.
...and assimilation will consume...
We've got a heartbeat.
The Klingon empire, the ecological...
-Key, please.
-Key.
Where's that damn torpedo?
She's ready, Jim.
Lock and load.
Fire.
To be, or not to be.
Target that explosion and fire.
Fire.
As I imagine this work will occupy us throughout most of the week, it would be my hope that the delegation could return to their capitals to implement the provisions of phase one, no later than the first of next month.
Scotty.
As you know, time is of the essence.
-Out of the way!
-Out of the way!
Mr. President!
Mr. President!
Mr. President!
Mr. President!
Kirk, Enterprise.
Protect the Chancellor!
-Arrest those men!
-Arrest yourself.
We've got a full confession.
Cartwright, just a minute.
What's happened?
What's the meaning of all of this?
It's about the future, Madam Chancellor.
Some people think the future means the end of history.
Well, we haven't run out of history quite yet.
Your father called the future the undiscovered country.
People can be very frightened of change.
You've restored my father's faith.
And you've restored my son's.
Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
And the good news is, they're not going to prosecute.
They might as well have prosecuted me.
I felt like Lieutenant Valeris.
Well, they don't arrest people for having feelings.
And it's a good thing, too.
If they did, we'd all have to turn ourselves in.
Captain Kirk.
Captain Sulu.
As much to the crew of the Enterprise, I owe you my thanks.
Nice to see you in action one more time, Captain Kirk.
Take care.
By God, that's a big ship.
-Not so big as her captain, I think.
-So, this is goodbye.
I think it's about time we got underway ourselves.
Captain, I have orders from Starfleet Command.
We're to put back to spacedock immediately to be decommissioned.
If I were human,
I believe my response would be,
"Go to hell."
If I were human.
Course heading, Captain?
Second star to the right, and straight on till morning.
Captain's Log, Stardate 9529.1.
This is the final cruise of the Starship Enterprise under my command.
This ship and her history will shortly become the care of another crew.
To them and their posterity will we commit our future.
They will continue the voyages we have begun, and journey to all the undiscovered countries, boldly going where no man...
Where no one
Stardate 9521.6.
Captain's log U.S.S. Excelsior.
Hikaru Sulu commanding.
After three years I've concluded my first assignment as master of this vessel cataloguing gaseous planetary anomalies in Beta Quadrant.
We're heading home under full impulse power.
I'm pleased to report that ship and crew have functioned well.
According to this, we've completed our survey of the entire sector.
I have an energy wave at 240 degrees mark six port.
Visual!
My...
God!
Shields.
Shields!
She's not answering her helm.
Starboard thrusters.
Turn her into the wave.
Go to impulse power.
- Damage report.
- Checking all systems.
- That was no meteor shower.
- Negative, sir.
The sub-space shock-wave originated at bearing 323.75.
Location...
It's Praxis, sir.
It's a Klingon moon.
Praxis is their key energy production facility.
Send to Klingon High Command. "This is Excelsior, a Federation Starship."
"We have monitored a large explosion in your sector."
- "Do you require assistance?"
- Aye, sir.
- Mr Vultane, any more data?
- I've confirmed Praxis' location, but...
- I cannot confirm Praxis' existence.
- On screen.
- Magnify.
- Computer enhancement.
- Praxis?
- What's left of it, sir.
Captain, I'm getting a message from Praxis.
Let's have it.
This is Brigadier Kerla, speaking for the High Command.
There has been an incident on Praxis.
However, everything is under control.
We have no need for assistance.
Obey treaty stipulations and remain outside the Neutral Zone.
This transmission ends now.
- An incident?
- Do we report this, sir?
Are you kidding?
- What are we doing here?
- Maybe it's a retirement party.
That suits me.
I just bought a boat.
I'm supposed to be chairing a seminar at the Academy.
- Isn't this just for top brass?
- Where is Sulu?
Captain Sulu?
On assignment.
Where's Spock?
This briefing is classified.
Ladies and gentlemen, the C-in-C.
As you were.
I'll break this information down succinctly.
The Klingon empire has 50 years of life left.
For full details, I'm turning this briefing over to Federation Special Envoy.
Good morning.
Two months ago a Federation Starship monitored an explosion on Praxis.
We believe it was caused by over-mining and insufficient safety precautions.
The moon's decimation means deadly pollution of their ozone.
They will have depleted their oxygen supply in 50 Earth years.
Due to their enormous military budget the Klingon economy doesn't have the resources to combat this catastrophe.
Last month, at the behest of the Vulcan Ambassador, -
- I opened a dialogue with Gorkon, Chancellor of the Klingon High Council.
He proposes to commence negotiations at once.
Negotiations for what?
The dismantling of our space stations and bases along the Neutral Zone, an end to 70 years of hostility, which the Klingons can no longer afford.
Bill, are we talking about mothballing the Starfleet?
Our exploration and scientific programs would be unaffected, but...
I must protest!
To offer Klingons safe haven within Federation space is suicide.
Klingons would become the alien trash of the galaxy.
If we dismantle the fleet, we'd be defenceless before an aggressive species on our territory.
The opportunity here is to bring them to their knees.
Then we'll be in a better position to dictate terms.
- Sir...
- Captain Kirk?
The Klingons have never been trustworthy.
I agree with Admiral Cartwright.
This is a terrifying idea.
It is imperative that we act now to support the Gorkon initiative, lest more conservative elements persuade his empire that it's better to attempt a military solution and die fighting.
You, Captain Kirk, are to be our first olive branch.
We are to rendezvous with the vessel which is bringing Gorkon to Earth and to escort him safely through Federation space.
Me?
There are Klingons who feel the same about the peace treaty as yourself, but they'll think twice about attacking the Enterprise under your command.
I have personally vouched for you in this matter.
You have personally vouched...?
You will extend Chancellor Gorkon full diplomatic courtesy, Captain.
- A full Ambassador is better equipped...
- If there's no further business I wish you and your crew Godspeed.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
I remind you this meeting is classified.
I don't know whether to congratulate you or not, Jim.
I wouldn't.
We volunteered?
There's an old Vulcan proverb.
"Only Nixon could go to China."
How could you vouch for me?
- That's arrogant presumption.
- My father requested that I open...
I know your father is the Vulcan Ambassador, but you know how I feel.
- They're animals.
- Jim...
- There is an historic opportunity here.
- Don't believe them!
Don't trust them.
- They're dying.
- Let them die.
Has it occurred to you that this crew is due to stand down in three months?
We've done our bit for king and country.
You should have trusted me.
Control, this is S-D 103, approach to Space dock.
Over.
You are clear to deliver Captain Kirk and party to N.C.C. 1701 Alpha.
- Captain on the bridge!
- As you were.
Lieutenant?
Val'eris, sir.
We were told you needed a helmsman, so I volunteered.
It is agreeable to see you again.
She was the first Vulcan to graduate at the top of her class at the Academy.
- You must be very proud.
- I don't believe so, sir.
She's a Vulcan, alright.
Let's get this over with.
Departure stations.
- Scotty?
Did you find the engine room?
- Right where I left it.
Stand by.
Uhura, get me the dock master.
Control tower reading, sir.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
This is Control.
Permission to depart granted. 30 seconds for port gates.
- Clear all moorings.
- Awaiting port gates from this mark.
- All lines clear.
- Aft thrusters.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
1 quarter impulse power.
Captain, regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock.
Jim...
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
Aye, sir.
Captain's log.
Stardate 9522.6.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I can never forgive them for the death of my boy.
To escort the Chancellor of the Klingon High Council to a peace summit is problematic, at best.
Spock says this could be an historic occasion.
I'd like to believe him.
But how on Earth can history get past people like me?
- Sorry.
- You could have knocked.
We are almost at the rendezvous, sir.
I thought that you would like to know.
Permission to speak freely, sir.
It is an honour to serve with you.
You piloted well out of space dock, Lieutenant.
I've always wanted to try that.
You've done well, Val'eris.
As your sponsor at the Academy I've followed your career with satisfaction.
And as a Vulcan, you have exceeded my expectations.
I do not understand this representation.
It's a depiction from ancient Earth mythology.
"The expulsion from Paradise."
- Why keep it in your quarters?
- To remind me that all things end.
It is of endings that I wish to speak.
Sir, I address you as a kindred intellect.
Do you not recognise that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
History is replete with turning points.
You must have faith.
- Faith?
- The universe will unfold as it should.
- Is that logical?
Surely we must...
- Logic, logic, logic.
Logic is the beginning of wisdom, Val'eris.
Not the end.
This will be my final voyage on board this vessel as a member of her crew.
Nature abhors a vacuum.
I intend you to replace me.
I could only succeed you, sir.
Now hear this.
All offiicers to the bridge.
Klingon battle cruiser off the port bow.
All Officers to the bridge.
Captain on the bridge!
Shall we raise our shields, Captain?
I've never been this close.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
- Uhura, hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Right standard rudder.
Bring us alongside.
Right standard rudder.
Z plus 5 degrees.
Channel is open, Captain.
This is the Starship Enterprise.
Captain James T. Kirk commanding.
This is Kronos One.
I am Chancellor Gorkon.
We've been ordered to escort you to your meeting on Earth.
Thank you.
Would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard the Enterprise as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We would be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 19:30 hours.
I shall look forward to that.
I hope you're happy.
Captain!
There is a supply of Romulan ale aboard.
It might make the evening pass more... smoothly.
Officer thinking, Lieutenant.
Guess who's coming to dinner.
Energize.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- Captain Kirk.
May I present Captain Spock, whom I believe you know.
Captain, face to face at last.
You have my thanks.
Chancellor.
Gentlemen.
This is my daughter, Azetbur...
My military advisor, Brigadier Kerla...
General Chang, my chief of staff.
I have so wanted to meet you, Captain.
- I'm not sure how to take that.
- Sincere admiration, Kirk.
From one warrior to another.
Right...
This way.
You might enjoy a brief tour.
- They all look alike.
- What about that smell?
You know only top of the line models can even talk...
- You men have work?
- Yes, ma'am.
Then snap to it.
I offer a toast.
The undiscovered country.
- The future.
- The undiscovered country.
Hamlet, act 3, scene 1 .
You have not experienced Shake- speare until you've read him in Klingon.
Captain Kirk.
I thought Romulan ale was illegal.
An advantage of being 1,000 light years from Federation headquarters.
To you, Chancellor Gorkon.
One of the architects of our future.
Chancellor!
Perhaps we are looking at something of that future here.
Tell me, Captain Kirk.
Would you be willing to give up Starfleet?
The Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace.
I wouldn't dispute my first officer.
Starfleet has always been...
There's no need to mince words.
In space, all warriors are cold warriors.
General, are you fond of...
Shakespeare?
We believe all planets have a sovereign claim to inalienable human rights.
"Inalien..." If you could only hear yourselves.
"Human rights." Why, the very name is racist.
The Federation is a "homo sapiens only" club.
Present company excepted, of course.
We know where this is leading - the annihilation of our culture.
That's not true.
No!
"To be or not to be"...
That is the question which preoccupies our people.
- We need breathing room.
- Earth.
Hitler, 1938.
I beg your pardon.
Well...
I see we have a long way to go.
We must do this again sometime.
You don't trust me, do you?
I don't blame you.
If there is to be a brave new world, our generation is going to have the hardest time living in it.
- Captain Spock.
- Chancellor.
Madam.
Captain.
Well, most kind.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
Hmm, Captain?
"Have we not heard the chimes at midnight?"
Thank God!
- Did you see the way they ate?
- Terrible table manners.
I doubt our own behaviour will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy.
I'm going to sleep this off.
Is there any other way we can screw up tonight?
I'm going to go find a pot of black coffee.
The Enterprise hosted Chancellor Gorkon to dinner last night.
Our manners weren't exactly Emily Post.
To the galley
- Romulan ale no longer to be served at diplomatic functions.
Captain Kirk, will you please join me on the bridge?
Captain Kirk?
- Captain.
- What is it?
- I find this curious.
- Spock, I'm really tired.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
- Where?
- It appears to emanate from us.
The Enterprise?
Val'eris, do you know anything about a radiation surge?
Chekov?
Only the size of my head.
I know what you mean.
- What's happened?
- We've fired on the Chancellor's ship.
Torpedo room!
Please confirm, have we fired?
- Uhura, monitor.
- Aye, sir.
- Direct hit.
- Confirmed, sir.
We've lost gravity!
We are betrayed!
This is the bridge.
Do you read me?
- Did we fire those torpedoes?
- Negative.
We're still fully loaded.
Find Chang.
Unable to confirm or deny firing the torpedoes.
- Hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Kronos One, this is Enterprise.
Do you read?
It's very hard to make out.
There's been weapons firing and a lot of shouting.
- She's still listing.
- She's spinning out of control.
Restoring auxiliary gravity...
Have you not a shred of decency in you, Kirk?
We come in peace, and you blatantly defy that peace.
For that, I shall blow you out of the stars.
- We haven't fired.
- Captain...
According to our data banks, we have.
Twice...
Captain, they're coming about.
- They're preparing to fire.
- Shields up, Captain?
- Captain, our shields.
- Shields up, Captain?
Signal our surrender.
We surrender!
- This is Enterprise.
We surrender.
- If they fire, with our shields down...
- ...we will not be able to respond.
- Repeat, Enterprise surrenders.
- Are we firing torpedoes?
- I wish I knew.
- I'm going aboard.
Spock, take the con.
- I involved you, I will go.
No, I'll go.
We'll not be the instigators of war on the eve of universal peace.
I'm going too, they may need a doctor.
Uhura, tell them we're coming, and tell them we're unarmed.
- Have you lost your mind?
!
- I don't understand what's happened.
We're here to help.
Follow me.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- My God!
What has happened here?
- You dare to feign ignorance?
- What happened?
With a direct torpedo hit, you crippled our gravitational field and two of your Starfleet crew beamed aboard wearing magnetic boots.
- Aren't you carrying a surgeon?
- We were until this disgrace.
Then for god's sake, let me help.
I've got a pulse - we can move him.
I need light.
Put him on the table.
Hold him!
Hold him while I stabilize him.
I said hold him!
Sweet Jesus.
- Can you...?
- I don't even know his anatomy.
- His wounds are not closing.
- He's killing him!
He's gone into some kind of damned arrest.
Come on, dammit!
Come on!
He's not responding.
Don't let it end this way, Captain.
Under article 184 of your Interstellar Law I'm placing you under arrest.
You're charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
He tried to save him.
They've been arrested.
Mr Spock, we've got to do something.
I assume command of this ship as of 02:30 hours.
Commander Uhura, notify Starfleet headquarters and request instructions.
We cannot allow them to be taken to Kronos as prisoners.
Opening fire will not retrieve them, and we must avoid an armed conflict.
We will be able to follow the Captain's movements.
- How did you achieve this?
- Time is precious.
We must piece together what happened here tonight.
According to our data bank, this ship fired those torpedoes.
- No way!
- I sympathize, but we need evidence.
Please accompany me.
And if we cannot piece together what happened?
What then, sir?
In that case, Mr Chekov, it resides in the purview of the diplomats.
The Chancellor of the High Council is dead!
The result of an unprovoked attack while he travelled to see you under a flag of truce on a mission of peace!
Captain Kirk was legally arrested for the crime.
He and Dr. McCoy boarded Kronos One of their own free will.
- None of these facts are in dispute.
- I have ordered an investigation.
- In the meantime...
- In the meantime we expect the Federation to abide by the articles of Interstellar Law.
Kirk and Dr. McCoy will stand trial for the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon.
Out of the question.
Ambassador Sarek, can we get them extradited?
I share a measure of personal responsibility in this matter, but I am obliged to confirm my esteemed colleagues legal interpretation.
What is the position of the Romulan government?
I must concur with my colleagues.
You can't believe that Kirk assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council.
Mr President.
I don't know what to believe.
I'm waiting for your answer, sir.
This President is not above the law.
Report back on the double.
Do you read?
- We're to report back at once.
- We can't abandon Kirk and McCoy.
400 years ago, on Earth, workers who felt their livelyhood threatened flung their wooden shoes called "sabots" into the machines to stop them.
Hence the word "sabotage".
We experience technical malfunction.
All back-up systems inoperative.
Excellent.
I mean... too bad.
Mr President, I have been named chancellorin my father's place.
Madam Chancellor, you have my condolences on your loss.
I assure you that this shameful deed will not...
Let us come to the point.
You want this conference to go forward.
I will attend in one week, on one condition.
We will not extradite the prisoners, and you will not attempt to rescue them.
We would consider any such attempt an act of war.
We hope you'll be our guest here on Earth.
After recent events, you will understand if I prefer a neutral site.
And in the interest of security, let us keep the location secret for now.
As you wish, Madam Chancellor.
Attack them now, while we still can.
Attack or be slaves in their world.
We can take whole by force, what they propose to divide.
War is obsolete, General.
As we are in danger of becoming.
Better to die on our feet than live on our knees.
That wasn't what my father wanted.
Your father was killed for what he wanted.
The peace process will go forward.
Kirk...
Kirk will pay for my father's death.
Kirk, Kirk, Kirk, Kirk...
It's a damn show trial.
The Enterprise fired on Kronos One without provocation.
The Chancellor and his advisors having been lulled into a false sense of security by an invitation to a dinner aboard Captain Kirk's vessel at precisely 19:30 hours that same evening.
Call your first witness.
After the first shot we lost our gravitational field.
I was weightless and couldn't function.
Then two Starfleet crewmen came towards me.
Or perhaps they merely wore Starfleet uniforms.
That remark is speculative.
I move that it be stricken.
We're interested in facts, not theories.
If the gravitational unit was not functioning, how could they walk?
They appeared to be wearing magnetic boots.
- Gravity boots...?
- Dr. McCoy.
Would you be so good as to tell me what is your current medical status?
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
You have a singular wit, Doctor.
For 27 years I've been surgeon aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.
In three months I stand down.
You know...
I believe that you consumed rather a generous amount of Romulan ale in the officers mess on the night in question.
- Objection.
- Sustained.
We all did.
All of us.
That doesn't mean...
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
Barely.
Now be careful, Doctor.
Have you ever in your past saved patients as barely alive as he?
I didn't have the medical knowledge I needed for Klingon anatomy.
- I see.
- You where there.
You say you are due for retirement.
May I ask, do your hands shake?
- Objection!
- I was nervous.
No.
You were incompetent.
You were incompetent!
Whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink.
- The court will have to determine.
- My God, man.
I tried to save him!
I tried to save him.
I was desperate to save him.
He was the last best hope in the Universe for peace.
The witness is excused.
There we have it, citizens.
We have established the particulars of the crime.
And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair.
James Tiberius Kirk.
What would your favourite author say, Captain?
"Let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings."
Tell us your sad story, Kirk.
Tell us that you planned to take revenge for the death of your son.
- That's not true.
- Objection!
Captain Kirk has not been identified as the assassin.
I offer into the record this excerpt from the Captain's personal log.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I've never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Again!
Again!
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I've never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Are those your words?
Those words were spoken by me.
Objection!
My client's political views are not on trial.
On the contrary.
Captain Kirk's views are at the very heart of the matter.
His record shows him to be an insubordinate, unprincipled opportunist with a history of violating the chain of command whenever it suited him.
Continue.
The record shows that Captain Kirk once held the rank of Admiral and he was broken for taking matters into his own hands.
Do you deny being demoted for these charges.
Answer me now!
- I cannot deny it.
- You were demoted?
- For insubordination?
- On occasion, I have disobeyed orders.
Were you obeying or disobeying orders when you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?
I didn't know about it until we boarded the ship.
You still deny the Enterprise fired on Kronos One?
And you still deny your men beamed aboard and shot the Chancellor?
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I didn't witness.
Are you aware that as the captain of a ship, you are responsible for the actions of your men?
I am.
If it's proved that members of your crew carried out the assassination...
- They're setting us up.
Your Honours!
- Do not answer.
Captain Kirk, you will answer the question.
As Captain I'm responsible for the crew under my command.
Your Honours, the state rests.
Send to Commander Enterprise.
"We stand ready to assist you.
Captain Sulu, U.S.S. Excelsior."
It is the determination of this court that the prisoners are guilty as charged.
I wish to note for the record that all the evidence is circumstantial.
I beg the court to consider this when pronouncing its sentence.
So noted.
Captain James T. Kirk, Dr. Leonard McCoy.
In the interest of fostering amity for the forthcoming peace talks, the sentence of death is commuted.
It is the judgement of this court that, without possibility of reprieve or parole, you be taken from this place to the dilithium mines on the penal asteroid of Rura Penthe.
There to spend the rest of your natural lives.
Rura Penthe!
Known throughout the galaxy as the alien's graveyard.
Better to kill them now and get it over with.
Lieutenant.
The torpedo hit once again, please.
Hold.
It is Enterprise.
We fired.
That is not possible!
All weapons visually accounted for, sir.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains must be the truth.
What does that mean?
That if we cannot have fired those torpedoes, someone else did.
They didn't fire on themselves and there are no other ships present.
- There was a neutron surge.
- Not from us.
A neutron surge that big could only be produced by another ship.
- Kronos One?
- Too far away.
Very near us.
Possibly beneath us.
If there were a ship beneath us, the Klingons would have seen it.
Would they?
- A Bird of Prey?
- A Bird of Prey.
- Cloaked?
- They can't fired when they're cloaked.
All things being equal, I would agree.
However, things are not equal.
This one can.
- We must inform Starfleet Command.
- Of what?
A new weapon that's invisible?
They'll call us raving lunatics.
They'll say we'll say anything to exonerate the Captain.
And they would be correct.
We have no evidence.
Only a theory which happens to fit the facts.
Assuming you're right.
Why would they fire on their own President?
Indeed.
This ship will be searched from bow to stern.
I do not understand.
If there was a ship underneath us surely the assassins beamed aboard from that vessel, not Enterprise.
You're forgetting something, Mr Chekov.
According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
If we did, the killers are here.
If we did not, whoever altered the data banks is here.
In either case, what we are looking for is here.
- What are we looking for, sir?
- Lieutenant.
Two pairs of gravity boots.
This is the gulag Rura Penthe.
There is no stockades, no guard tower, no electronic frontier.
Only a magnetic shield prevents beaming.
Punishment means exile from prison to the surface.
On the surface, nothing can survive.
Work well, and you will be treated well.
Work badly, and you will die.
Oh, my God!
The universal translator has been confiscated.
I'm sorry...?
He's definitely on about something, Jim.
If this is your spot, we'll move on.
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
- He's got it.
- And your coat.
I'm afraid not.
It wouldn't fit.
- Thanks.
- This will help keep you warm.
- I'm Martia.
You're Kirk and McCoy.
- How did you know that?
We don't get many presidential assassins.
- We didn't kill Gorkon.
- Of course not.
- But there's a reward for your death.
- That figures.
We've been set up.
Somebody up there wants you out of the way.
- Any progress?
- None.
A crew of 300 are looking everywhere, but the killers may still be among them.
Surely they have disposed of these boots by now.
Would it not have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
Logic must give way to physics.
Gravity wasn't restored when they escaped.
Without the boots, they would have floated off the transporter pads.
Why not simply vaporize them?
Like this?
As you know, no one can fire an unauthorized phaser aboard a starship.
Suppose, when they returned, they threw the boots into the refuse.
I'm having the refuse searched.
If I'm correct, those boots will cling to the killer's necks like Tiberian bats.
They couldn't escape without them nor throw them out the window.
Those boots are here.
Somewhere.
- Did someone fire off a phaser?
- It's alright.
It's nothing.
Mr Spock, Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
- Who fired the...
- Ah, Mr Scott.
I hear you have difficulty with the warp drive.
How long do you need for repair?
There's nothing wrong with the bloody thing.
If we return to space dock, the killers can dispose of their footwear and we will never see the Captain or Dr. McCoy alive again.
- It could take weeks.
- Thank you.
Val'eris, inform Starfleet our warp drive is inoperative.
- A lie?
- An error.
We have lost all contact with the Captain and Dr. McCoy.
Yes, at the moment they're surrounded by a magnetic shield.
But if I know the Captain, he is deep into planning his escape.
You've got him where you want him, Jim!
- Are you alright?
- I think so.
- They'll respect you now.
- I was lucky that thing had knees.
That was not his knee.
Not everybody keep their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Anything you want to tell me?
See what you can do for him.
Let him know we're not holding a grudge.
Suppose he's holding a grudge?
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
- Do you want to get out of here?
- There's got to be a way.
Three months before retirement.
What a way to finish.
- We're not finished.
- Speak for yourself.
One day, one night...
Kobayashi Maru!
Bones!
Are you afraid of the future?
I believe that was the general idea that I was trying to convey.
- I don't mean this future.
- What is this - multiple choice?
Some people are afraid...
of what might happen.
- I was terrified.
- What terrified you, specifically?
No more neutral zone.
I was used to hating Klingons.
It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his words.
- Spock was right.
- We all felt exactly the same.
No.
Somebody felt a lot worse.
I'm beginning to understand why.
If you've got any bright ideas, now is the time.
Time is the problem.
You and I are nothing.
You heard the judge - the peace conference is on again.
Whoever killed Gorkon is bound to attempt another assassination.
Unless we can get out of here.
It's me
- Martia.
Listen.
No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
- Except us.
- It is possible.
I know how to get outside the shield.
- How do we fit in?
- Getting outside the shield is easy.
After that, you have to get us off the surface before we freeze.
Can you?
- It's possible.
- I can't make it alone.
You're the likeliest candidate to come here for months.
Candidate for what?
Go to lift 7 in the morning for mining duty.
I'll see you there.
Don't disappoint me.
- What is it with you, anyway?
- Still think we're finished?
More than ever.
Sorry to wake you, sir.
Starfleet requests any data we have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
What?
They're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to space dock, sir.
Signal Starfleet that we have no idea location Enterprise.
- Sir?
- You have hearing problems?
No, sir.
Klingon blood.
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
This is the first evidence which corroborates our theory.
Now we go to Starfleet?
We expand our search to include uniforms.
All uniforms?
Clear, sir.
Make a hole.
Coming through.
Coming through.
Sir!
Sir!
- I think we've been had.
- No, you weren't, Doctor.
Get off at the first level.
Follow the gang into the mine.
They don't take girls.
- You are crewman Dax?
- Yes.
What is the problem?
Perhaps you know Russian epic of Cinderella?
If shoe fits - wear it.
Mr Chekov...
Watch me.
What kind of creature is this?
Last night you two were...
Get in.
Come on.
We don't have a lot of time.
Hurry!
Up there.
Come on - climb!
Here, you'll need these.
Quickly!
Stay close.
- There they are.
- They emerge from the beaming shield.
Mr Scott, start your engines.
Mr Chekov, set course for Rura Penthe.
Mr Spock, Rura Penthe is deep inside the Klingon frontier.
- If we're discovered...
- Correct.
We need a feat of linguistic legerdemain and intrepidity before the Captain and Dr. McCoy freeze to death.
- Leave me, I'm finished.
- No!
Bones, I'm wearing a viridium patch on my back.
Spock slapped it there before we went on Gorkon's ship.
That cunning little Vulcan.
Come on!
We're in the clear.
Now that we're outside the shield, they can locate us two sectors away.
If they're even looking for us.
This is listening post Morska.
What ship is that, over?
We must respond.
A universal translator would be recognised.
We am thy freighter...
Ursva.
Six weeks out of Kronos.
"What is your destination, over? "
We is condemning food things and supplies.
Don't catch any bugs.
Would you mind explaining that little trick you do?
- I'm a Chameloid.
- I've heard about you.
Shape-shifters.
I thought you were mythical.
Give a girl a chance, Captain.
It takes a lot of effort.
I don't doubt it.
Stop me if I'm wrong, but do we have any way of knowing whether this is the real you?
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.
We're outside the shield.
Now it's your turn, Captain.
If you say so.
Are you crazy?
!
She didn't need our help.
Where did you get these convenient clothes?
Don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue.
It's to let them know where we are.
Ask her what she's getting in return.
A full pardon... which doesn't cover this.
An accident wasn't good enough.
Come on, Spock.
Good enough for one.
Two would have looked suspicious.
Killed while attempting escape.
That's convincing for both.
Surprise!
- Your friends are late.
- They'll be along.
- I can't believe I kissed you.
- Must have been your lifelong ambition.
Isn't it time you became something else?
I like it here.
Well, well, well...
What took you so long?
Kill him, he's the one.
Not me, you idiot - him!
- No witnesses.
- Killed while trying to escape.
- Damned clever, if you ask me.
- It's a classic.
- That's what he wanted.
- Who?
Who wanted us killed?
Since you're all going to die anyway, why not tell you?
His name is...
Damn it!
What the hell!
Son of a...!
Couldn't you have waited two seconds?
He was about to explain the whole thing.
- You want to go back?
- Absolutely not!
This is the bridge.
We're still in Klingon space.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
They were beamed aboard a Federation Starship.
I could trace...
Escaped.
Kirk cannot know the location of the peace conference.
Are you sure?
Will you take that chance?
Helmsman, make course to intercept Enterprise.
The Klingons have a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked.
- She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
- So that's it.
We believe that Gorkon's murderers are aboard this ship.
- Has the peace conference begun?
- Who knows?
The location is secret.
- There's always something.
- Captain!
Mr Spock!
I found the uniforms with the Klingon blood on them.
But the uniforms belong to these two men.
Burke and Samno.
Not anymore.
Phaser on "stun" at close range.
First rule of assassination - kill the assassins.
- Now we're back to square one.
- Can I talk to you?
- Why weren't they vaporized?
- It would set off the alarm.
It's possible.
Now hear this.
Now hear this.
Court reporter to sick bay.
Code blue - urgent.
Statements to be taken at once from Yeomen Burke and Samno.
Repeat, court reporter to sick bay.
Code blue - urgent.
Statements to be taken.
Repeat, statements to be taken from Yeomen Burke and Samno.
You have to shoot.
If you are logical, you have to shoot.
- I do not want to.
- What you want is irrelevant.
What you've chosen is at hand.
I'd just as soon you didn't.
The operation is over.
I did not fire.
You cannot prove anything.
Yes, I can.
At my trial my personal log was used against me.
How long did you wait outside my quarters before I noticed you?
You knew?
I tried to tell you, but you would not listen.
Neither of us was hearing very well that night.
There were things I tried to tell you, about having faith.
You have betrayed the Federation.
All of you.
- And what have you've been doing?
- Saving Starfleet.
Klingons cannot be trusted.
Sir...
You said so yourself.
They killed your son.
Did you not wish Gorkon dead?
"Let them die", you said.
Did I misinterpret you?
And you were right.
They conspired with us to assassinate their own Chancellor.
How trustworthy can they be?
Klingons and Federation members conspiring together.
- Who is "us"?
- All who stands to lose from peace.
Names, Lieutenant.
My comrades will make certain all your transmissions are jammed.
- Names, Lieutenant!
- I do not remember.
A lie?
A choice.
Spock.
Admiral Cartwright.
From Starfleet?
Who else?
General...
Chang.
- Who else?
- Romulan Ambassador and others.
Where is the peace conference?
Where is the peace conference?
She does not know.
Then we're dead.
I have been dead before.
Contact Excelsior.
- She'll have the co-ordinates.
- I've already got it, sir.
- Standing by, Captain Kirk.
- Sulu.
You realize that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations.
I'm sorry, Captain.
Yourmessage is breaking up.
Bless you, Sulu.
Where is the peace conference?
They'll attempt another assassination.
It's at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border.
I'm sending the co-ordinates on a coded frequency.
We'll need more than that.
There's a Bird of Prey on the look-out for us that can fire when cloaked.
Surely not.
How many of those things are there?
Come on, Lieutenant.
- Just the prototype.
- Do you hear that?
I'm getting under way now.
We're in Alpha Quadrant.
The chances of our reaching the conference in time are slim.
- When does this conference start?
- According to my information - today.
- Thank you, Captain Sulu.
- Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
Spock?
I prefer it dark.
- Dining on ashes?
- You were right.
It was arrogant presumption on my part that got us into this situation.
You and the Doctor might have been killed.
The night is young.
You said it yourself, it was logical.
Peace is worth a few personal risks.
You're a great one for logic.
I'm a great one for rushing in where angels fear to tread.
We're both extremists.
Reality is probably somewhere in between.
I couldn't get past the death of my son.
I was prejudiced by her accomplishments as a Vulcan.
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was.
Is it possible that we two, you and I, have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?
Would that constitute a joke?
- It wasn't your fault.
- I was responsible.
- For no actions but your own.
- That's not what you said at your trial.
That was as captain of the ship.
Human beings...
We both know that I am not human.
Do you want to know something?
Everybody's human.
I find that remark... insulting.
Come, I need you.
Madam Chancellor, members of the diplomatic corps honoured guests.
The United Federation of Planets welcomes you to Camp Khitomer.
She's out here somewhere.
- But if she's cloaked...
- Then all we have is a radiation surge.
By the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes.
2.06... 2.03...
- Close enough to beam down?
- Not yet.
In two minutes. 1 .58.
Go to impulse power for Khitomer.
Let us redefine progress to mean that just because we can do a thing it does not necessarily follow that we must do that thing.
- Uhura?
- Nothing, Captain.
If she's here, she's rigged for silent running.
Coming up on transporter range in 57 seconds.
Transporter room.
Stand by to beam down.
53... 48 seconds.
44...
I can see you, Kirk.
Chang.
Can you see me?
Now be honest, Captain.
Warrior to warrior.
You do prefer it this way, don't you?
As it was meant to be.
No peace in our time.
"Once more unto the breach, dearfriends. "
- This is fun.
- Reverse engines.
All astern.
One and a half impulse power.
Back off!
What's she doing?
What's she waiting for?
Probably attempting to ascertain why we are reversing.
Wondering whether we detect her.
Incoming!
- In range?
- Not yet, sir.
Come on!
- She'll fly apart.
- Fly her apart, then!
Many speculated about my father's motives.
Some said he was an idealist.
Others said he had no choice.
If Praxis had not exploded, his idealism wouldn't have found expression.
We are a proud race.
We are here because we intend to go on being proud.
- Go to auxiliary power!
- Auxiliary circuits destroyed.
"Tickle us, do we not laugh?
Prick us, do we not bleed?"
"Wrong us, shall we not revenge?"
Gas.
Gas, Captain.
Under impulse power she expands fuel, like all vessels.
We call it "plasma", but it is merely ionised gas.
What about our equipment to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
The thing's got to have a tail-pipe.
Doctor, would you assist me in performing surgery on a torpedo?
Fascinating.
Hard to starboard.
The proposed agenda is as follows:
The evacuation of Kronos has been calculated within the 50 Earth year time span.
Phase 1 - preparation for evacuation...
Captain, she's packing quite a wallop.
Shields weakening.
Shields up!
Alright, now we're giving them something else to shoot at.
The game's afoot.
- Excelsior's been hit!
- "Our revels now are ended", Kirk.
"Cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war."
- Bones, where's my torpedo?
- Bet you wished you'd stayed in bed.
Shields collapsing!
The key, please.
Time is short.
- The hull has been compromised.
- I wonder how bad.
Connect echo-bars.
...discuss the report on phase 2.
- Alter circuit A.
- Sensor.
...we commence within minutes of the preparation.
- "I am constant as the Northern star."
- I'd give real money, if he'd shut up.
Plate, please.
...and assimilation will consume...
We've got a heart beat.
...with the Klingon Empire...
Key, please.
- Where's that torpedo?
- She's ready.
Lock and load!
Fire!
"To be... or not" "to be."
Target that explosion and fire.
Fire!
This work will occupy us throughout most of the week.
I hope that the delegation can implement the provisions of Phase 1 by the first of next month.
As you know, time is of the essence.
Out of the way!
Mr President!
Mr President!
Kirk, Enterprise.
Protect the Chancellor!
- Arrest those men!
- Arrest yourself!
We've got a full confession.
- This is not Klingon blood.
- Cartwright.
Just a minute.
What's happened?
What's the mean of all of this?
It's about the future, Madam Chancellor.
Some people think the future means the end of history.
We haven't run out of history quite yet.
Your father called the future "the undiscovered country".
People can be very frightened of change.
You've restored my father's faith.
And you've restored my son's.
Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
And they're not going to prosecute.
They could have prosecuted me.
I felt like Val'eris.
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
And it's a good thing, too.
If they did, we'd all have to turn ourselves in.
- Captain Kirk.
- Captain Sulu.
As much to the crew of the Enterprise, I owe you my thanks.
Nice to see you in action one more time, Captain Kirk.
Take care.
- My God, that's a big ship.
- Not so big as her captain.
So...
This is goodbye?
It's about time we got underway ourselves.
Captain, I have orders from Starfleet Command.
We're to put back to space dock immediately... to be decommissioned.
If I were human, I believe my response would be:
"Go to hell."
If I were human.
Course heading, Captain?
Second star to the right.
And straight on 'til morning.
Captain's log, stardate 9529. 1.
This is the final cruise of the Starship Enterprise under my command.
This ship, and her history will shortly become the care of another crew.
To them and their posterity will we commit our future.
They'll continue the voyages we have begun and journey to all the undiscovered countries boldly going where no man, where no one has gone before.
Captain's log U.S.S. Excelsior.
Hikaru Sulu commanding.
After three years I've concluded my first assignment as master of this vessel cataloguing gaseous planetary anomalies in Beta Quadrant.
We're heading home under full impulse power.
I'm pleased to report that ship and crew have functioned well.
According to this, we've completed our survey of the entire sector.
I have an energy wave at 240 degrees mark six port.
Visual!
My...
God!
Shields.
Shields!
She's not answering her helm.
Starboard thrusters.
Turn her into the wave.
Go to impulse power.
- Damage report.
- Checking all systems.
- That was no meteor shower.
- Negative, sir.
The sub-space shock-wave originated at bearing 323.75.
Location...
It's Praxis, sir.
It's a Klingon moon.
Praxis is their key energy production facility.
Send to Klingon High Command. "This is Excelsior, a Federation Starship."
"We have monitored a large explosion in your sector."
- "Do you require assistance?"
- Aye, sir.
- Mr Vultane, any more data?
- I've confirmed Praxis' location, but...
- I cannot confirm Praxis' existence.
- On screen.
- Magnify.
- Computer enhancement.
- Praxis?
- What's left of it, sir.
Captain, I'm getting a message from Praxis.
Let's have it.
This is Brigadier Kerla, speaking for the High Command.
There has been an incident on Praxis.
However, everything is under control.
We have no need for assistance.
Obey treaty stipulations and remain outside the Neutral Zone.
This transmission ends now.
- An incident?
- Do we report this, sir?
Are you kidding?
- What are we doing here?
- Maybe it's a retirement party.
That suits me.
I just bought a boat.
I'm supposed to be chairing a seminar at the Academy.
- Isn't this just for top brass?
- Where is Sulu?
Captain Sulu?
On assignment.
Where's Spock?
This briefing is classified.
Ladies and gentlemen, the C-in-C.
As you were.
I'll break this information down succinctly.
The Klingon empire has 50 years of life left.
For full details, I'm turning this briefing over to Federation Special Envoy.
Good morning.
Two months ago a Federation Starship monitored an explosion on Praxis.
We believe it was caused by over-mining and insufficient safety precautions.
The moon's decimation means deadly pollution of their ozone.
They will have depleted their oxygen supply in 50 Earth years.
Due to their enormous military budget the Klingon economy doesn't have the resources to combat this catastrophe.
Last month, at the behest of the Vulcan Ambassador, -
- I opened a dialogue with Gorkon, Chancellor of the Klingon High Council.
He proposes to commence negotiations at once.
Negotiations for what?
The dismantling of our space stations and bases along the Neutral Zone, an end to 70 years of hostility, which the Klingons can no longer afford.
Bill, are we talking about mothballing the Starfleet?
Our exploration and scientific programs would be unaffected, but...
I must protest!
To offer Klingons safe haven within Federation space is suicide.
Klingons would become the alien trash of the galaxy.
If we dismantle the fleet, we'd be defenceless before an aggressive species on our territory.
The opportunity here is to bring them to their knees.
Then we'll be in a better position to dictate terms.
- Sir...
- Captain Kirk?
The Klingons have never been trustworthy.
I agree with Admiral Cartwright.
This is a terrifying idea.
It is imperative that we act now to support the Gorkon initiative, lest more conservative elements persuade his empire that it's better to attempt a military solution and die fighting.
You, Captain Kirk, are to be our first olive branch.
We are to rendezvous with the vessel which is bringing Gorkon to Earth and to escort him safely through Federation space.
Me?
There are Klingons who feel the same about the peace treaty as yourself, but they'll think twice about attacking the Enterprise under your command.
I have personally vouched for you in this matter.
You have personally vouched...?
You will extend Chancellor Gorkon full diplomatic courtesy, Captain.
- A full Ambassador is better equipped...
- If there's no further business I wish you and your crew Godspeed.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
I remind you this meeting is classified.
I don't know whether to congratulate you or not, Jim.
I wouldn't.
We volunteered?
There's an old Vulcan proverb.
"Only Nixon could go to China."
How could you vouch for me?
- That's arrogant presumption.
- My father requested that I open...
I know your father is the Vulcan Ambassador, but you know how I feel.
- They're animals.
- Jim...
- There is an historic opportunity here.
- Don't believe them!
Don't trust them.
- They're dying.
- Let them die.
Has it occurred to you that this crew is due to stand down in three months?
We've done our bit for king and country.
You should have trusted me.
Control, this is S-D 103, approach to Space dock.
Over.
You are clear to deliver Captain Kirk and party to N.C.C. 1701 Alpha.
- Captain on the bridge!
- As you were.
Lieutenant?
Val'eris, sir.
We were told you needed a helmsman, so I volunteered.
It is agreeable to see you again.
She was the first Vulcan to graduate at the top of her class at the Academy.
- You must be very proud.
- I don't believe so, sir.
She's a Vulcan, alright.
Let's get this over with.
Departure stations.
- Scotty?
Did you find the engine room?
- Right where I left it.
Stand by.
Uhura, get me the dock master.
Control tower reading, sir.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
This is Control.
Permission to depart granted. 30 seconds for port gates.
- Clear all moorings.
- Awaiting port gates from this mark.
- All lines clear.
- Aft thrusters.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
1 quarter impulse power.
Captain, regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock.
Jim...
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
Aye, sir.
Captain's log.
Stardate 9522.6.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I can never forgive them for the death of my boy.
To escort the Chancellor of the Klingon High Council to a peace summit is problematic, at best.
Spock says this could be an historic occasion.
I'd like to believe him.
But how on Earth can history get past people like me?
- Sorry.
- You could have knocked.
We are almost at the rendezvous, sir.
I thought that you would like to know.
Permission to speak freely, sir.
It is an honour to serve with you.
You piloted well out of space dock, Lieutenant.
I've always wanted to try that.
You've done well, Val'eris.
As your sponsor at the Academy I've followed your career with satisfaction.
And as a Vulcan, you have exceeded my expectations.
I do not understand this representation.
It's a depiction from ancient Earth mythology.
"The expulsion from Paradise."
- Why keep it in your quarters?
- To remind me that all things end.
It is of endings that I wish to speak.
Sir, I address you as a kindred intellect.
Do you not recognise that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
History is replete with turning points.
You must have faith.
- Faith?
- The universe will unfold as it should.
- Is that logical?
Surely we must...
- Logic, logic, logic.
Logic is the beginning of wisdom, Val'eris.
Not the end.
This will be my final voyage on board this vessel as a member of her crew.
Nature abhors a vacuum.
I intend you to replace me.
I could only succeed you, sir.
Now hear this.
All offiicers to the bridge.
Klingon battle cruiser off the port bow.
All Officers to the bridge.
Captain on the bridge!
Shall we raise our shields, Captain?
I've never been this close.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
- Uhura, hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Right standard rudder.
Bring us alongside.
Right standard rudder.
Z plus 5 degrees.
Channel is open, Captain.
This is the Starship Enterprise.
Captain James T. Kirk commanding.
This is Kronos One.
I am Chancellor Gorkon.
We've been ordered to escort you to your meeting on Earth.
Thank you.
Would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard the Enterprise as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We would be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 19:30 hours.
I shall look forward to that.
I hope you're happy.
Captain!
There is a supply of Romulan ale aboard.
It might make the evening pass more... smoothly.
Officer thinking, Lieutenant.
Guess who's coming to dinner.
Energize.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- Captain Kirk.
May I present Captain Spock, whom I believe you know.
Captain, face to face at last.
You have my thanks.
Chancellor.
Gentlemen.
This is my daughter, Azetbur...
My military advisor, Brigadier Kerla...
General Chang, my chief of staff.
I have so wanted to meet you, Captain.
- I'm not sure how to take that.
- Sincere admiration, Kirk.
From one warrior to another.
Right...
This way.
You might enjoy a brief tour.
- They all look alike.
- What about that smell?
You know only top of the line models can even talk...
- You men have work?
- Yes, ma'am.
Then snap to it.
I offer a toast.
The undiscovered country.
- The future.
- The undiscovered country.
Hamlet, act 3, scene 1 .
You have not experienced Shake- speare until you've read him in Klingon.
Captain Kirk.
I thought Romulan ale was illegal.
An advantage of being 1,000 light years from Federation headquarters.
To you, Chancellor Gorkon.
One of the architects of our future.
Chancellor!
Perhaps we are looking at something of that future here.
Tell me, Captain Kirk.
Would you be willing to give up Starfleet?
The Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace.
I wouldn't dispute my first officer.
Starfleet has always been...
There's no need to mince words.
In space, all warriors are cold warriors.
General, are you fond of...
Shakespeare?
We believe all planets have a sovereign claim to inalienable human rights.
"Inalien..." If you could only hear yourselves.
"Human rights." Why, the very name is racist.
The Federation is a "homo sapiens only" club.
Present company excepted, of course.
We know where this is leading - the annihilation of our culture.
That's not true.
No!
"To be or not to be"...
That is the question which preoccupies our people.
- We need breathing room.
- Earth.
Hitler, 1938.
I beg your pardon.
Well...
I see we have a long way to go.
We must do this again sometime.
You don't trust me, do you?
I don't blame you.
If there is to be a brave new world, our generation is going to have the hardest time living in it.
- Captain Spock.
- Chancellor.
Madam.
Captain.
Well, most kind.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
Hmm, Captain?
"Have we not heard the chimes at midnight?"
Thank God!
- Did you see the way they ate?
- Terrible table manners.
I doubt our own behaviour will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy.
I'm going to sleep this off.
Is there any other way we can screw up tonight?
I'm going to go find a pot of black coffee.
The Enterprise hosted Chancellor Gorkon to dinner last night.
Our manners weren't exactly Emily Post.
To the galley
- Romulan ale no longer to be served at diplomatic functions.
Captain Kirk, will you please join me on the bridge?
Captain Kirk?
- Captain.
- What is it?
- I find this curious.
- Spock, I'm really tired.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
- Where?
- It appears to emanate from us.
The Enterprise?
Val'eris, do you know anything about a radiation surge?
Chekov?
Only the size of my head.
I know what you mean.
- What's happened?
- We've fired on the Chancellor's ship.
Torpedo room!
Please confirm, have we fired?
- Uhura, monitor.
- Aye, sir.
- Direct hit.
- Confirmed, sir.
We've lost gravity!
We are betrayed!
This is the bridge.
Do you read me?
- Did we fire those torpedoes?
- Negative.
We're still fully loaded.
Find Chang.
Unable to confirm or deny firing the torpedoes.
- Hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Kronos One, this is Enterprise.
Do you read?
It's very hard to make out.
There's been weapons firing and a lot of shouting.
- She's still listing.
- She's spinning out of control.
Restoring auxiliary gravity...
Have you not a shred of decency in you, Kirk?
We come in peace, and you blatantly defy that peace.
For that, I shall blow you out of the stars.
- We haven't fired.
- Captain...
According to our data banks, we have.
Twice...
Captain, they're coming about.
- They're preparing to fire.
- Shields up, Captain?
- Captain, our shields.
- Shields up, Captain?
Signal our surrender.
We surrender!
- This is Enterprise.
We surrender.
- If they fire, with our shields down...
- ...we will not be able to respond.
- Repeat, Enterprise surrenders.
- Are we firing torpedoes?
- I wish I knew.
- I'm going aboard.
Spock, take the con.
- I involved you, I will go.
No, I'll go.
We'll not be the instigators of war on the eve of universal peace.
I'm going too, they may need a doctor.
Uhura, tell them we're coming, and tell them we're unarmed.
- Have you lost your mind?
!
- I don't understand what's happened.
We're here to help.
Follow me.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- My God!
What has happened here?
- You dare to feign ignorance?
- What happened?
With a direct torpedo hit, you crippled our gravitational field and two of your Starfleet crew beamed aboard wearing magnetic boots.
- Aren't you carrying a surgeon?
- We were until this disgrace.
Then for god's sake, let me help.
I've got a pulse - we can move him.
I need light.
Put him on the table.
Hold him!
Hold him while I stabilize him.
I said hold him!
Sweet Jesus.
- Can you...?
- I don't even know his anatomy.
- His wounds are not closing.
- He's killing him!
He's gone into some kind of damned arrest.
Come on, dammit!
Come on!
He's not responding.
Don't let it end this way, Captain.
Under article 184 of your Interstellar Law I'm placing you under arrest.
You're charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
He tried to save him.
They've been arrested.
Mr Spock, we've got to do something.
I assume command of this ship as of 02:30 hours.
Commander Uhura, notify Starfleet headquarters and request instructions.
We cannot allow them to be taken to Kronos as prisoners.
Opening fire will not retrieve them, and we must avoid an armed conflict.
We will be able to follow the Captain's movements.
- How did you achieve this?
- Time is precious.
We must piece together what happened here tonight.
According to our data bank, this ship fired those torpedoes.
- No way!
- I sympathize, but we need evidence.
Please accompany me.
And if we cannot piece together what happened?
What then, sir?
In that case, Mr Chekov, it resides in the purview of the diplomats.
The Chancellor of the High Council is dead!
The result of an unprovoked attack while he travelled to see you under a flag of truce on a mission of peace!
Captain Kirk was legally arrested for the crime.
He and Dr. McCoy boarded Kronos One of their own free will.
- None of these facts are in dispute.
- I have ordered an investigation.
- In the meantime...
- In the meantime we expect the Federation to abide by the articles of Interstellar Law.
Kirk and Dr. McCoy will stand trial for the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon.
Out of the question.
Ambassador Sarek, can we get them extradited?
I share a measure of personal responsibility in this matter, but I am obliged to confirm my esteemed colleagues legal interpretation.
What is the position of the Romulan government?
I must concur with my colleagues.
You can't believe that Kirk assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council.
Mr President.
I don't know what to believe.
I'm waiting for your answer, sir.
This President is not above the law.
Mr President, Starfleet command is here from San Francisco.
- Mr President.
- Mr President.
Bill, Admiral Cartwright, please sit down.
Mr President, we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
I'm constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
Sir, would you please take a look at this.
We prepared Operation Retrieve based on the danger of terrorism between the Klingon empire and the Federation.
We can go in, rescue the hostages and get out in 24 hours with acceptable losses.
- We have the technology...
- Yes, yes.
But suppose you precipitate a full-scale war?
Then, quite frankly, we can clean their chronometers.
Mr President, they are vulnerable.
There will never be a better time.
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be.
I'll bear that in mind.
Thank you, gentlemen, that's all for now.
Mr President.
Sir...
Those men have literally saved this planet.
And now they're going to save it again.
By standing trial.
Report back on the double.
Do you read?
- We're to report back at once.
- We can't abandon Kirk and McCoy.
400 years ago, on Earth, workers who felt their livelyhood threatened flung their wooden shoes called "sabots" into the machines to stop them.
Hence the word "sabotage".
We experience technical malfunction.
All back-up systems inoperative.
Excellent.
I mean... too bad.
Mr President, I have been named chancellorin my father's place.
Madam Chancellor, you have my condolences on your loss.
I assure you that this shameful deed will not...
Let us come to the point.
You want this conference to go forward.
I will attend in one week, on one condition.
We will not extradite the prisoners, and you will not attempt to rescue them.
We would consider any such attempt an act of war.
We hope you'll be our guest here on Earth.
After recent events, you will understand if I prefer a neutral site.
And in the interest of security, let us keep the location secret for now.
As you wish, Madam Chancellor.
Attack them now, while we still can.
Attack or be slaves in their world.
We can take whole by force, what they propose to divide.
War is obsolete, General.
As we are in danger of becoming.
Better to die on our feet than live on our knees.
That wasn't what my father wanted.
Your father was killed for what he wanted.
The peace process will go forward.
Kirk...
Kirk will pay for my father's death.
It is as I said, Mr Spock.
Inventory registers every torpedo.
Yet the data banks insist we fired.
- One computer is lying.
- A computer doesn't lie!
Precisely.
Therefore we must inspect each torpedo visually.
That could take hours!
And if they're all there?
Then someone forged an entry in the data banks.
Gorkon's daughter has been named Chancellor.
It was on the news.
I'll bet that bitch killed her father.
- Her own father?
- It is an old story, sir.
They don't place the same value on life as we do, you know that.
Take my word, she did not shed one bloody tear.
Hardly conclusive, since Klingons have no tear-ducts.
Lieutenant, any response from Starfleet since our dispatch?
Yes, sir.
And?
Commander Uhura is experiencing technical difficulties, sir.
Curious.
Very well.
For 24 hours, we will agree this conversation didn't take place.
- A lie?
- An omission.
In 24 hours we won't have a clue where Captain Kirk is.
- I know precisely where he will be.
- You do?
Where?
Kirk, Kirk, Kirk, Kirk...
It's a damn show trial.
The Enterprise fired on Kronos One without provocation.
The Chancellor and his advisors having been lulled into a false sense of security by an invitation to a dinner aboard Captain Kirk's vessel at precisely 19:30 hours that same evening.
Call your first witness.
After the first shot we lost our gravitational field.
I was weightless and couldn't function.
Then two Starfleet crewmen came towards me.
Or perhaps they merely wore Starfleet uniforms.
That remark is speculative.
I move that it be stricken.
We're interested in facts, not theories.
If the gravitational unit was not functioning, how could they walk?
They appeared to be wearing magnetic boots.
- Gravity boots...?
- Dr. McCoy.
Would you be so good as to tell me what is your current medical status?
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
You have a singular wit, Doctor.
For 27 years I've been surgeon aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.
In three months I stand down.
You know...
I believe that you consumed rather a generous amount of Romulan ale in the officers mess on the night in question.
- Objection.
- Sustained.
We all did.
All of us.
That doesn't mean...
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
Barely.
Now be careful, Doctor.
Have you ever in your past saved patients as barely alive as he?
I didn't have the medical knowledge I needed for Klingon anatomy.
- I see.
- You where there.
You say you are due for retirement.
May I ask, do your hands shake?
- Objection!
- I was nervous.
No.
You were incompetent.
You were incompetent!
Whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink.
- The court will have to determine.
- My God, man.
I tried to save him!
I tried to save him.
I was desperate to save him.
He was the last best hope in the Universe for peace.
The witness is excused.
There we have it, citizens.
We have established the particulars of the crime.
And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair.
James Tiberius Kirk.
What would your favourite author say, Captain?
"Let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings."
Tell us your sad story, Kirk.
Tell us that you planned to take revenge for the death of your son.
- That's not true.
- Objection!
Captain Kirk has not been identified as the assassin.
I offer into the record this excerpt from the Captain's personal log.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I've never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Again!
Again!
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I've never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Are those your words?
Those words were spoken by me.
Objection!
My client's political views are not on trial.
On the contrary.
Captain Kirk's views are at the very heart of the matter.
His record shows him to be an insubordinate, unprincipled opportunist with a history of violating the chain of command whenever it suited him.
Continue.
The record shows that Captain Kirk once held the rank of Admiral and he was broken for taking matters into his own hands.
Do you deny being demoted for these charges.
Answer me now!
- I cannot deny it.
- You were demoted?
- For insubordination?
- On occasion, I have disobeyed orders.
Were you obeying or disobeying orders when you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?
I didn't know about it until we boarded the ship.
You still deny the Enterprise fired on Kronos One?
And you still deny your men beamed aboard and shot the Chancellor?
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I didn't witness.
Are you aware that as the captain of a ship, you are responsible for the actions of your men?
I am.
If it's proved that members of your crew carried out the assassination...
- They're setting us up.
Your Honours!
- Do not answer.
Captain Kirk, you will answer the question.
As Captain I'm responsible for the crew under my command.
Your Honours, the state rests.
Send to Commander Enterprise.
"We stand ready to assist you.
Captain Sulu, U.S.S. Excelsior."
It is the determination of this court that the prisoners are guilty as charged.
I wish to note for the record that all the evidence is circumstantial.
I beg the court to consider this when pronouncing its sentence.
So noted.
Captain James T. Kirk, Dr. Leonard McCoy.
In the interest of fostering amity for the forthcoming peace talks, the sentence of death is commuted.
It is the judgement of this court that, without possibility of reprieve or parole, you be taken from this place to the dilithium mines on the penal asteroid of Rura Penthe.
There to spend the rest of your natural lives.
Rura Penthe!
Known throughout the galaxy as the alien's graveyard.
Better to kill them now and get it over with.
Lieutenant.
The torpedo hit once again, please.
Hold.
It is Enterprise.
We fired.
That is not possible!
All weapons visually accounted for, sir.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains must be the truth.
What does that mean?
That if we cannot have fired those torpedoes, someone else did.
They didn't fire on themselves and there are no other ships present.
- There was a neutron surge.
- Not from us.
A neutron surge that big could only be produced by another ship.
- Kronos One?
- Too far away.
Very near us.
Possibly beneath us.
If there were a ship beneath us, the Klingons would have seen it.
Would they?
- A Bird of Prey?
- A Bird of Prey.
- Cloaked?
- They can't fired when they're cloaked.
All things being equal, I would agree.
However, things are not equal.
This one can.
- We must inform Starfleet Command.
- Of what?
A new weapon that's invisible?
They'll call us raving lunatics.
They'll say we'll say anything to exonerate the Captain.
And they would be correct.
We have no evidence.
Only a theory which happens to fit the facts.
Assuming you're right.
Why would they fire on their own President?
Indeed.
This ship will be searched from bow to stern.
I do not understand.
If there was a ship underneath us surely the assassins beamed aboard from that vessel, not Enterprise.
You're forgetting something, Mr Chekov.
According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
If we did, the killers are here.
If we did not, whoever altered the data banks is here.
In either case, what we are looking for is here.
- What are we looking for, sir?
- Lieutenant.
Two pairs of gravity boots.
This is the gulag Rura Penthe.
There is no stockades, no guard tower, no electronic frontier.
Only a magnetic shield prevents beaming.
Punishment means exile from prison to the surface.
On the surface, nothing can survive.
Work well, and you will be treated well.
Oh, my God!
The universal translator has been confiscated.
I'm sorry...?
He's definitely on about something, Jim.
If this is your spot, we'll move on.
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
- He's got it.
- And your coat.
I'm afraid not.
It wouldn't fit.
- Thanks.
- This will help keep you warm.
- I'm Martia.
You're Kirk and McCoy.
- How did you know that?
We don't get many presidential assassins.
- We didn't kill Gorkon.
- Of course not.
- But there's a reward for your death.
- That figures.
We've been set up.
Somebody up there wants you out of the way.
- Any progress?
- None.
A crew of 300 are looking everywhere, but the killers may still be among them.
Surely they have disposed of these boots by now.
Would it not have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
Logic must give way to physics.
Gravity wasn't restored when they escaped.
Without the boots, they would have floated off the transporter pads.
Why not simply vaporize them?
Like this?
As you know, no one can fire an unauthorized phaser aboard a starship.
Suppose, when they returned, they threw the boots into the refuse.
I'm having the refuse searched.
If I'm correct, those boots will cling to the killer's necks like Tiberian bats.
They couldn't escape without them nor throw them out the window.
Those boots are here.
Somewhere.
- Did someone fire off a phaser?
- It's alright.
It's nothing.
Mr Spock, Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
- Who fired the...
- Ah, Mr Scott.
I hear you have difficulty with the warp drive.
How long do you need for repair?
There's nothing wrong with the bloody thing.
If we return to space dock, the killers can dispose of their footwear and we will never see the Captain or Dr. McCoy alive again.
- It could take weeks.
- Thank you.
Val'eris, inform Starfleet our warp drive is inoperative.
- A lie?
- An error.
We have lost all contact with the Captain and Dr. McCoy.
Yes, at the moment they're surrounded by a magnetic shield.
But if I know the Captain, he is deep into planning his escape.
You've got him where you want him, Jim!
- Are you alright?
- I think so.
- They'll respect you now.
- I was lucky that thing had knees.
That was not his knee.
Not everybody keep their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Anything you want to tell me?
See what you can do for him.
Let him know we're not holding a grudge.
Suppose he's holding a grudge?
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
- Do you want to get out of here?
- There's got to be a way.
Three months before retirement.
What a way to finish.
- We're not finished.
- Speak for yourself.
One day, one night...
Kobayashi Maru!
Bones!
Are you afraid of the future?
I believe that was the general idea that I was trying to convey.
- I don't mean this future.
- What is this - multiple choice?
Some people are afraid...
of what might happen.
- I was terrified.
- What terrified you, specifically?
No more neutral zone.
I was used to hating Klingons.
It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his words.
- Spock was right.
- We all felt exactly the same.
No.
Somebody felt a lot worse.
I'm beginning to understand why.
If you've got any bright ideas, now is the time.
Time is the problem.
You and I are nothing.
You heard the judge - the peace conference is on again.
Whoever killed Gorkon is bound to attempt another assassination.
Unless we can get out of here.
It's me
- Martia.
Listen.
No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
- Except us.
- It is possible.
I know how to get outside the shield.
- How do we fit in?
- Getting outside the shield is easy.
After that, you have to get us off the surface before we freeze.
Can you?
- It's possible.
- I can't make it alone.
You're the likeliest candidate to come here for months.
Candidate for what?
Go to lift 7 in the morning for mining duty.
I'll see you there.
Don't disappoint me.
- What is it with you, anyway?
- Still think we're finished?
More than ever.
Sorry to wake you, sir.
Starfleet requests any data we have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
What?
They're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to space dock, sir.
Signal Starfleet that we have no idea location Enterprise.
- Sir?
- You have hearing problems?
No, sir.
Klingon blood.
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
This is the first evidence which corroborates our theory.
Now we go to Starfleet?
We expand our search to include uniforms.
All uniforms?
Clear, sir.
Make a hole.
Coming through.
Coming through.
Sir!
Sir!
- I think we've been had.
- No, you weren't, Doctor.
Get off at the first level.
Follow the gang into the mine.
They don't take girls.
- You are crewman Dax?
- Yes.
What is the problem?
Perhaps you know Russian epic of Cinderella?
If shoe fits - wear it.
Mr Chekov...
Watch me.
What kind of creature is this?
Last night you two were...
Get in.
Come on.
We don't have a lot of time.
Hurry!
Up there.
Come on - climb!
Here, you'll need these.
Quickly!
Stay close.
- There they are.
- They emerge from the beaming shield.
Mr Scott, start your engines.
Mr Chekov, set course for Rura Penthe.
Mr Spock, Rura Penthe is deep inside the Klingon frontier.
- If we're discovered...
- Correct.
We need a feat of linguistic legerdemain and intrepidity -
- Leave me, I'm finished.
- No!
Bones, I'm wearing a viridium patch on my back.
Spock slapped it there before we went on Gorkon's ship.
That cunning little Vulcan.
Come on!
We're in the clear.
Now that we're outside the shield, they can locate us two sectors away.
If they're even looking for us.
This is listening post Morska.
What ship is that, over?
We must respond.
A universal translator would be recognised.
We am thy freighter...
Ursva.
Six weeks out of Kronos.
"What is your destination, over? "
We is condemning food things and supplies.
Don't catch any bugs.
Would you mind explaining that little trick you do?
- I'm a Chameloid.
- I've heard about you.
Shape-shifters.
I thought you were mythical.
Give a girl a chance, Captain.
It takes a lot of effort.
I don't doubt it.
Stop me if I'm wrong, but do we have any way of knowing whether this is the real you?
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.
We're outside the shield.
Now it's your turn, Captain.
If you say so.
Are you crazy?
!
She didn't need our help.
Where did you get these convenient clothes?
Don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue.
It's to let them know where we are.
Ask her what she's getting in return.
A full pardon... which doesn't cover this.
An accident wasn't good enough.
Come on, Spock.
Good enough for one.
Two would have looked suspicious.
Killed while attempting escape.
That's convincing for both.
Surprise!
- Your friends are late.
- They'll be along.
- I can't believe I kissed you.
- Must have been your lifelong ambition.
Isn't it time you became something else?
I like it here.
Well, well, well...
What took you so long?
Kill him, he's the one.
Not me, you idiot - him!
- No witnesses.
- Killed while trying to escape.
- Damned clever, if you ask me.
- It's a classic.
- That's what he wanted.
- Who?
Who wanted us killed?
Since you're all going to die anyway, why not tell you?
His name is...
Damn it!
What the hell!
Son of a...!
Couldn't you have waited two seconds?
He was about to explain the whole thing.
- You want to go back?
- Absolutely not!
This is the bridge.
We're still in Klingon space.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
They were beamed aboard a Federation Starship.
I could trace...
Escaped.
Kirk cannot know the location of the peace conference.
Are you sure?
Will you take that chance?
Helmsman, make course to intercept Enterprise.
The Klingons have a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked.
- She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
- So that's it.
We believe that Gorkon's murderers are aboard this ship.
- Has the peace conference begun?
- Who knows?
The location is secret.
- There's always something.
- Captain!
Mr Spock!
I found the uniforms with the Klingon blood on them.
But the uniforms belong to these two men.
Burke and Samno.
Not anymore.
Phaser on "stun" at close range.
First rule of assassination - kill the assassins.
- Now we're back to square one.
- Can I talk to you?
- Why weren't they vaporized?
- It would set off the alarm.
It's possible.
Now hear this.
Now hear this.
Court reporter to sick bay.
Code blue - urgent.
Statements to be taken at once from Yeomen Burke and Samno.
Repeat, court reporter to sick bay.
Code blue - urgent.
Statements to be taken.
Repeat, statements to be taken from Yeomen Burke and Samno.
You have to shoot.
If you are logical, you have to shoot.
- I do not want to.
- What you want is irrelevant.
What you've chosen is at hand.
I'd just as soon you didn't.
The operation is over.
I did not fire.
You cannot prove anything.
Yes, I can.
At my trial my personal log was used against me.
How long did you wait outside my quarters before I noticed you?
You knew?
I tried to tell you, but you would not listen.
Neither of us was hearing very well that night.
There were things I tried to tell you, about having faith.
You have betrayed the Federation.
All of you.
- And what have you've been doing?
- Saving Starfleet.
Klingons cannot be trusted.
Sir...
You said so yourself.
They killed your son.
Did you not wish Gorkon dead?
"Let them die", you said.
Did I misinterpret you?
And you were right.
They conspired with us to assassinate their own Chancellor.
How trustworthy can they be?
Klingons and Federation members conspiring together.
- Who is "us"?
- All who stands to lose from peace.
Names, Lieutenant.
My comrades will make certain all your transmissions are jammed.
- Names, Lieutenant!
- I do not remember.
A lie?
A choice.
Spock.
Admiral Cartwright.
From Starfleet?
Who else?
General...
Chang.
- Who else?
- Romulan Ambassador and others.
Where is the peace conference?
Where is the peace conference?
She does not know.
Then we're dead.
I have been dead before.
Contact Excelsior.
- She'll have the co-ordinates.
- I've already got it, sir.
- Standing by, Captain Kirk.
- Sulu.
You realize that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations.
I'm sorry, Captain.
Yourmessage is breaking up.
Bless you, Sulu.
Where is the peace conference?
They'll attempt another assassination.
It's at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border.
I'm sending the co-ordinates on a coded frequency.
We'll need more than that.
There's a Bird of Prey on the look-out for us that can fire when cloaked.
Surely not.
How many of those things are there?
Come on, Lieutenant.
- Just the prototype.
- Do you hear that?
I'm getting under way now.
We're in Alpha Quadrant.
The chances of our reaching the conference in time are slim.
- When does this conference start?
- According to my information - today.
- Thank you, Captain Sulu.
- Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
Spock?
I prefer it dark.
- Dining on ashes?
- You were right.
It was arrogant presumption on my part that got us into this situation.
You and the Doctor might have been killed.
The night is young.
You said it yourself, it was logical.
Peace is worth a few personal risks.
You're a great one for logic.
I'm a great one for rushing in where angels fear to tread.
We're both extremists.
Reality is probably somewhere in between.
I couldn't get past the death of my son.
I was prejudiced by her accomplishments as a Vulcan.
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was.
Is it possible that we two, you and I, have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?
Would that constitute a joke?
- It wasn't your fault.
- I was responsible.
- For no actions but your own.
- That's not what you said at your trial.
That was as captain of the ship.
Human beings...
We both know that I am not human.
Do you want to know something?
Everybody's human.
I find that remark... insulting.
Come, I need you.
Madam Chancellor, members of the diplomatic corps honoured guests.
The United Federation of Planets welcomes you to Camp Khitomer.
She's out here somewhere.
- But if she's cloaked...
- Then all we have is a radiation surge.
By the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes.
2.06... 2.03...
- Close enough to beam down?
- Not yet.
In two minutes. 1 .58.
Go to impulse power for Khitomer.
Let us redefine progress to mean that just because we can do a thing it does not necessarily follow that we must do that thing.
- Uhura?
- Nothing, Captain.
If she's here, she's rigged for silent running.
Coming up on transporter range in 57 seconds.
Transporter room.
Stand by to beam down.
53... 48 seconds.
44...
I can see you, Kirk.
Chang.
Can you see me?
Now be honest, Captain.
Warrior to warrior.
You do prefer it this way, don't you?
As it was meant to be.
No peace in our time.
"Once more unto the breach, dearfriends. "
- This is fun.
- Reverse engines.
All astern.
One and a half impulse power.
Back off!
What's she doing?
What's she waiting for?
Probably attempting to ascertain why we are reversing.
Wondering whether we detect her.
Incoming!
- In range?
- Not yet, sir.
Come on!
- She'll fly apart.
- Fly her apart, then!
Many speculated about my father's motives.
Some said he was an idealist.
Others said he had no choice.
If Praxis had not exploded, his idealism wouldn't have found expression.
We are a proud race.
We are here because we intend to go on being proud.
- Go to auxiliary power!
- Auxiliary circuits destroyed.
"Tickle us, do we not laugh?
Prick us, do we not bleed?"
"Wrong us, shall we not revenge?"
Gas.
Gas, Captain.
Under impulse power she expands fuel, like all vessels.
We call it "plasma", but it is merely ionised gas.
What about our equipment to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
The thing's got to have a tail-pipe.
Doctor, would you assist me in performing surgery on a torpedo?
Fascinating.
Hard to starboard.
The proposed agenda is as follows:
The evacuation of Kronos has been calculated within the 50 Earth year time span.
Phase 1 - preparation for evacuation...
Captain, she's packing quite a wallop.
Shields weakening.
Shields up!
Alright, now we're giving them something else to shoot at.
The game's afoot.
- Excelsior's been hit!
- "Our revels now are ended", Kirk.
"Cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war."
- Bones, where's my torpedo?
- Bet you wished you'd stayed in bed.
Shields collapsing!
The key, please.
Time is short.
- The hull has been compromised.
- I wonder how bad.
Connect echo-bars.
...discuss the report on phase 2.
- Alter circuit A.
- Sensor.
...we commence within minutes of the preparation.
- "I am constant as the Northern star."
- I'd give real money, if he'd shut up.
Plate, please.
...and assimilation will consume...
We've got a heart beat.
...with the Klingon Empire...
Key, please.
- Where's that torpedo?
- She's ready.
Lock and load!
Fire!
"To be... or not" "to be."
Target that explosion and fire.
Fire!
This work will occupy us throughout most of the week.
I hope that the delegation can implement the provisions of Phase 1 by the first of next month.
As you know, time is of the essence.
Out of the way!
Mr President!
Mr President!
Kirk, Enterprise.
Protect the Chancellor!
- Arrest those men!
- Arrest yourself!
We've got a full confession.
- This is not Klingon blood.
- Cartwright.
Just a minute.
It's Colonel West!
What's happened?
What's the mean of all of this?
It's about the future, Madam Chancellor.
Some people think the future means the end of history.
We haven't run out of history quite yet.
Your father called the future "the undiscovered country".
People can be very frightened of change.
You've restored my father's faith.
And you've restored my son's.
Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
And they're not going to prosecute.
They could have prosecuted me.
I felt like Val'eris.
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
And it's a good thing, too.
If they did, we'd all have to turn ourselves in.
- Captain Kirk.
- Captain Sulu.
As much to the crew of the Enterprise, I owe you my thanks.
Nice to see you in action one more time, Captain Kirk.
Take care.
- My God, that's a big ship.
- Not so big as her captain.
So...
This is goodbye?
It's about time we got underway ourselves.
Captain, I have orders from Starfleet Command.
We're to put back to space dock immediately... to be decommissioned.
If I were human, I believe my response would be:
"Go to hell."
If I were human.
Course heading, Captain?
Second star to the right.
And straight on 'til morning.
Captain's log, stardate 9529. 1.
This is the final cruise of the Starship Enterprise under my command.
This ship, and her history will shortly become the care of another crew.
To them and their posterity will we commit our future.
They'll continue the voyages we have begun and journey to all the undiscovered countries boldly going where no man, where no one has gone before.
Stardate 9521.6.
Captain's log U.S.S. Excelsior.
Hikaru Sulu commanding.
After three years I've concluded my first assignment as master of this vessel cataloguing gaseous planetary anomalies in Beta Quadrant.
We're heading home under full impulse power.
I'm pleased to report that ship and crew have functioned well.
According to this, we've completed our survey of the entire sector.
I have an energy wave at 240 degrees mark six port.
Visual!
My...
God!
Shields.
Shields!
She's not answering her helm.
Starboard thrusters.
Turn her into the wave.
Go to impulse power.
- Damage report.
- Checking all systems.
- That was no meteor shower.
- Negative, sir.
The sub-space shock-wave originated at bearing 323.75.
Location...
It's Praxis, sir.
It's a Klingon moon.
Praxis is their key energy production facility.
Send to Klingon High Command. "This is Excelsior, a Federation Starship."
"We have monitored a large explosion in your sector."
- "Do you require assistance?"
- Aye, sir.
- Mr. Vultane, any more data?
- I've confirmed Praxis' location, but...
- I cannot confirm Praxis' existence.
- On screen.
- Magnify.
- Computer enhancement.
- Praxis?
- What's left of it, sir.
Captain, I'm getting a message from Praxis.
Let's have it.
This is Brigadier Kerla, speaking for the High Command.
There has been an incident on Praxis.
However, everything is under control.
We have no need for assistance.
Obey treaty stipulations and remain outside the Neutral Zone.
This transmission ends now.
- An incident?
- Do we report this, sir?
Are you kidding?
- What are we doing here?
- Maybe it's a retirement party.
That suits me.
I just bought a boat.
I'm supposed to be chairing a seminar at the Academy.
- Isn't this just for top brass?
- Where is Sulu?
Captain Sulu?
On assignment.
Where's Spock?
This briefing is classified.
Ladies and gentlemen, the C-in-C.
As you were.
I'll break this information down succinctly.
The Klingon empire has 50 years of life left.
For full details, I'm turning this briefing over to the Federation Special Envoy.
Good morning.
Two months ago a Federation Starship monitored an explosion on Praxis.
We believe it was caused by over-mining and insufficient safety precautions.
The moon's decimation means a deadly pollution of their ozone.
They will have depleted their oxygen supply in 50 Earth years.
Due to their enormous military budget the Klingon economy doesn't have the resources to combat this catastrophe.
Last month, at the behest of the Vulcan Ambassador, -
- I opened a dialogue with Gorkon, Chancellor of the Klingon High Council.
He proposes to commence negotiations at once.
Negotiations for what?
The dismantling of our space stations and bases along the Neutral Zone.
An end to 70 years of hostility, which the Klingons can no longer afford.
Bill, are we talking about mothballing the Starfleet?
Our exploration and scientific programs would be unaffected, but...
I must protest!
To offer Klingons safe haven within Federation space is suicide.
Klingons would become the alien trash of the galaxy.
If we dismantle the fleet, we'd be defenseless before an aggressive species on our territory.
The opportunity here is to bring them to their knees.
Then we'll be in a better position to dictate terms.
- Sir...
- Captain Kirk?
The Klingons have never been trustworthy.
I agree with Admiral Cartwright.
This is a terrifying idea.
It is imperative that we act now to support the Gorkon initiative, lest more conservative elements persuade his empire that it's better to attempt a military solution and die fighting.
You, Captain Kirk, are to be our first olive branch.
We are to rendezvous with the vessel which is bringing Gorkon to Earth and to escort him safely through Federation space.
Me?
There are Klingons who feel the same about the peace treaty as yourself, but they'll think twice about attacking the Enterprise under your command.
I have personally vouched for you in this matter.
You have personally vouched?
You will extend Chancellor Gorkon full diplomatic courtesy, Captain.
- A full Ambassador is better equipped...
- If there's no further business I wish you and your crew Godspeed.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
I remind you this meeting is classified.
I don't know whether to congratulate you or not, Jim.
I wouldn't.
We volunteered?
There's an old Vulcan proverb.
"Only Nixon could go to China."
How could you vouch for me?
- That's arrogant presumption.
- My father requested that I open...
I know your father is the Vulcan Ambassador, but you know how I feel.
- They're animals.
- Jim...
- There is an historic opportunity here.
- Don't believe them!
Don't trust them.
- They're dying.
- Let them die.
Has it occurred to you that this crew is due to stand down in three months?
We've done our bit for king and country.
You should have trusted me.
Control, this is S-D 103, approach to Space dock.
Over.
You are clear to deliver Captain Kirk and party to N.C.C. 1701 Alpha.
- Captain on the bridge!
- As you were.
Lieutenant?
Val'eris, sir.
We were told you needed a helmsman, so I volunteered.
It is agreeable to see you again.
She was the first Vulcan to graduate at the top of her class at the Academy.
- You must be very proud.
- I don't believe so, sir.
She's a Vulcan, alright.
Let's get this over with.
Departure stations.
- Scotty?
Did you find the engine room?
- Right where I left it.
Stand by.
Uhura, get me the dock master.
Control tower reading, sir.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
This is Control.
Permission to depart granted. 30 seconds for port gates.
- Clear all moorings.
- Awaiting port gates from this mark.
- All lines clear.
- Aft thrusters.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
1 quarter impulse power.
Captain, regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock.
Jim...
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
Aye, sir.
Captain's log.
Stardate 9522.6.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I can never forgive them for the death of my boy.
To escort the Chancellor of the Klingon High Council to a peace summit is problematic, at best.
Spock says this could be an historic occasion.
I'd like to believe him.
But how on Earth can history get past people like me?
- Sorry.
- You could have knocked.
We are almost at the rendezvous, sir.
I thought that you would like to know.
Permission to speak freely, sir.
It is an honor to serve with you.
You piloted well out of space dock, Lieutenant.
I've always wanted to try that.
You've done well, Val'eris.
As your sponsor at the Academy I've followed your career with satisfaction.
And as a Vulcan, you have exceeded my expectations.
I do not understand this representation.
It's a depiction from ancient Earth mythology.
"The expulsion from Paradise."
- Why keep it in your quarters?
- To remind me that all things end.
It is of endings that I wish to speak.
Sir, I address you as a kindred intellect.
Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
History is replete with turning points.
You must have faith.
- Faith?
- The universe will unfold as it should.
- Is that logical?
Surely we must...
- Logic, logic, logic.
Logic is the beginning of wisdom, Val'eris.
Not the end.
This will be my final voyage on board this vessel as a member of her crew.
Nature abhors a vacuum.
I intend you to replace me.
I could only succeed you, sir.
Now hear this.
All officers to the bridge.
Klingon battle cruiser off the port bow.
All Officers to the bridge.
Captain on the bridge!
Shall we raise our shields, Captain?
I've never been this close.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
- Uhura, hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Right standard rudder.
Bring us alongside.
Right standard rudder.
Z plus 5 degrees.
Channel is open, Captain.
This is the Starship Enterprise.
Captain James T. Kirk commanding.
This is Kronos One.
I am Chancellor Gorkon.
We've been ordered to escort you to your meeting on Earth.
Thank you.
Would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard the Enterprise as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We would be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 19:30 hours.
I shall look forward to that.
I hope you're happy.
Captain!
There is a supply of Romulan ale aboard.
It might make the evening pass more... smoothly.
Officer thinking, Lieutenant.
Guess who's coming to dinner.
Energize.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- Captain Kirk.
May I present Captain Spock, whom I believe you know.
Captain, face to face at last.
You have my thanks.
Chancellor.
Gentlemen.
This is my daughter, Azetbur...
My military advisor, Brigadier Kerla and this is General Chang, my chief of staff.
I have so wanted to meet you, Captain.
- I'm not sure how to take that.
- Sincere admiration, Kirk.
From one warrior to another.
Right...
This way.
You might enjoy a brief tour.
- They all look alike.
- What about that smell?
You know only top of the line models can even talk...
- You men have work?
- Yes, ma'am.
Then snap to it.
I offer a toast.
The undiscovered country.
- The future.
- The undiscovered country.
Hamlet, act 3, scene 1.
You have not experienced Shakespeare until you've read him in Klingon.
Captain Kirk.
I thought Romulan ale was illegal.
An advantage of being 1,000 light years from Federation headquarters.
To you, Chancellor Gorkon.
One of the architects of our future.
Chancellor!
Perhaps we are looking at something of that future here.
Tell me, Captain Kirk.
Would you be willing to give up Starfleet?
The Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace.
I wouldn't dispute my first officer.
Starfleet has always been...
There's no need to mince words.
In space, all warriors are cold warriors.
General, are you fond of...
Shakespeare?
We believe all planets have a sovereign claim to inalienable human rights.
"Inalien..." If you could only hear yourselves.
"Human rights." Why, the very name is racist.
The Federation is a "homo sapiens only" club.
Present company excepted, of course.
We know where this is leading - the annihilation of our culture.
That's not true.
No!
"To be or not to be"...
That is the question which preoccupies our people.
- We need breathing room.
- Earth.
Hitler, 1938.
I beg your pardon?
Well...
I see we have a long way to go.
We must do this again sometime.
You don't trust me, do you?
I don't blame you.
If there is to be a brave new world, our generation is going to have the hardest time living in it.
- Captain Spock.
- Chancellor.
Madam.
Captain.
Well, most kind.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
Hmm, Captain?
"Have we not heard the chimes at midnight?"
Thank God!
- Did you see the way they ate?
- Terrible table manners.
I doubt our own behavior will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy.
I'm going to sleep this off.
Is there any other way we can screw up tonight?
I'm going to go find a pot of black coffee.
The Enterprise hosted Chancellor Gorkon to dinner last night.
Our manners weren't exactly Emily Post.
To the galley
- Romulan ale no longer to be served at diplomatic functions.
Captain Kirk, will you please join me on the bridge?
Captain Kirk?
- Captain.
- What is it?
- I find this curious.
- Spock, I'm really tired.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
- Where?
- It appears to emanate from us.
The Enterprise?
Val'eris, do you know anything about a radiation surge?
Chekov?
Only the size of my head.
I know what you mean.
- What's happened?
- We've fired on the Chancellor's ship.
Torpedo room!
Please confirm, have we fired?
- Uhura, monitor.
- Aye, sir.
- Direct hit.
- Confirmed, sir.
This is the bridge.
Do you read me?
- Did we fire those torpedoes?
- Negative.
We're still fully loaded.
Unable to confirm or deny firing the torpedoes.
- Hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Kronos One, this is Enterprise.
Do you read?
It's very hard to make out.
There's been weapons firing and a lot of shouting.
- She's still listing.
- She's spinning out of control.
Have you not a shred of decency in you, Kirk?
We come in peace, and you blatantly defy that peace.
For that, I shall blow you out of the stars.
- We haven't fired.
- Captain...
According to our data banks, we have.
Twice...
Captain, they're coming about.
- They're preparing to fire.
- Shields up, Captain?
- Captain, our shields.
- Shields up, Captain?
Signal our surrender.
We surrender!
- This is Enterprise.
We surrender.
- If they fire, with our shields down we will not be able to respond.
- Repeat, Enterprise surrenders.
- Are we firing torpedoes?
- I wish I knew.
- I'm going aboard.
Spock, take the con.
- I involved you, I will go.
No, I'll go.
We'll not be the instigators of war on the eve of universal peace.
I'm going too, they may need a doctor.
Uhura, tell them we're coming, and tell them we're unarmed.
- Have you lost your mind?
!
- I don't understand what's happened.
We're here to help.
Follow me.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- My God!
What has happened here?
- You dare to feign ignorance?
- What happened?
With a direct torpedo hit, you crippled our gravitational field and two of your Starfleet crew beamed aboard wearing magnetic boots.
- Aren't you carrying a surgeon?
- We were until this disgrace.
Then for God's sake, let me help.
I've got a pulse - we can move him.
I need light.
Put him on the table.
Hold him!
Hold him while I stabilize him.
I said hold him!
Sweet Jesus.
- Can you?
- I don't even know his anatomy.
- His wounds are not closing.
- He's killing him!
He's gone into some kind of damned arrest.
Come on, dammit!
Come on!
He's not responding.
Don't let it end this way, Captain.
Under article 184 of your Interstellar Law I'm placing you under arrest.
You're charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
He tried to save him.
They've been arrested.
Mr. Spock, we've got to do something.
I assume command of this ship as of 02:30 hours.
Commander Uhura, notify Starfleet headquarters and request instructions.
We cannot allow them to be taken to Kronos as prisoners.
Opening fire will not retrieve them, and we must avoid an armed conflict.
We will be able to follow the Captain's movements.
- How did you achieve this?
- Time is precious.
We must piece together what happened here tonight.
According to our data bank, this ship fired those torpedoes.
- No way!
- I sympathize, but we need evidence.
Please accompany me.
And if we cannot piece together what happened?
What then, sir?
In that case, Mr. Chekov, it resides in the purview of the diplomats.
The Chancellor of the High Council is dead!
The result of an unprovoked attack while he traveled to see you under a flag of truce on a mission of peace!
Captain Kirk was legally arrested for the crime.
He and Dr. McCoy boarded Kronos One of their own free will.
- None of these facts are in dispute.
- I have ordered an investigation.
- In the meantime...
- In the meantime we expect the Federation to abide by the articles of Interstellar Law.
Kirk and Dr. McCoy will stand trial for the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon.
Out of the question.
Ambassador Sarek, can we get them extradited?
Mr. President, I share a measure of personal responsibility in this matter, but I am obliged to confirm my esteemed colleagues legal interpretation.
What is the position of the Romulan government?
I must concur with my colleagues.
You can't believe that Kirk assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council.
Mr. President.
I don't know what to believe.
I'm waiting for your answer, sir.
This President is not above the law.
Mr. President, Starfleet command is here from San Francisco.
- Mr. President.
- Mr. President.
Bill, Admiral Cartwright, please sit down.
Mr. President, we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
I'm constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
Sir, would you please take a look at this.
We prepared Operation Retrieve based on the danger of terrorism between the Klingon empire and the Federation.
We can go in, rescue the hostages and get out in 24 hours with acceptable losses.
- We have the technology...
- Yes, yes.
But suppose you precipitate a full-scale war?
Then, quite frankly, we can clean their chronometers.
Mr. President, they are vulnerable.
There will never be a better time.
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be.
I'll bear that in mind.
Thank you, gentlemen, that's all for now.
Mr. President.
Sir...
Those men have literally saved this planet.
I know that.
And now they're going to save it again.
By standing trial.
Enterprise, report back on the double.
Do you read?
- We're to report back at once.
- We can't abandon Kirk and McCoy.
400 years ago, on Earth, workers who felt their livelihood threatened flung their wooden shoes called "sabots" into the machines to stop them.
Hence the word "sabotage".
We experience technical malfunction.
All back-up systems inoperative.
Excellent.
I mean... too bad.
Mr. President, I have been named chancellor in my father's place.
Madam Chancellor, you have my condolences on your loss.
I assure you that this shameful deed will not...
Let us come to the point.
You want this conference to go forward.
I will attend in one week, on one condition.
We will not extradite the prisoners, and you will not attempt to rescue them.
We would consider any such attempt an act of war.
We hope you'll be our guest here on Earth.
After recent events, you will understand if I prefer a neutral site.
And in the interests of security, let us keep the location secret for now.
As you wish, Madam Chancellor.
Your father was killed for what he wanted.
The peace process will go forward.
Kirk...
Kirk will pay for my father's death.
It is as I said, Mr. Spock.
Inventory registers every torpedo.
Yet the data banks insist we fired.
- One computer is lying.
- A computer doesn't lie!
Precisely.
Therefore we must inspect each torpedo visually.
That could take hours!
And if they're all there?
Then someone forged an entry in the data banks.
Gorkon's daughter has been named Chancellor.
It was on the news.
I'll bet that bitch killed her father.
- Her own father?
- It is an old story, sir.
They don't place the same value on life as we do, you know that.
Take my word, she did not shed one bloody tear.
Hardly conclusive, since Klingons have no tear-ducts.
Lieutenant, any response from Starfleet since our dispatch?
Yes, sir.
And?
Commander Uhura is experiencing technical difficulties, sir.
Curious.
Very well.
For 24 hours, we will agree this conversation didn't take place.
- A lie?
- An omission.
In 24 hours we won't have a clue where Captain Kirk is.
- I know precisely where he will be.
- You do?
Where?
Kirk, Kirk, Kirk, Kirk...
It's a damn show trial.
The Enterprise fired on Kronos One without provocation.
The Chancellor and his advisors having been lulled into a false sense of security by an invitation to a dinner aboard Captain Kirk's vessel at precisely 19:30 hours that same evening.
Call your first witness.
After the first shot we lost our gravitational field.
I was weightless and couldn't function.
Then two Starfleet crewmen came towards me.
Or perhaps they merely wore Starfleet uniforms.
That remark is speculative.
I move that it be stricken.
We're interested in facts, not theories.
If the gravitational unit was not functioning, how could they walk?
They appeared to be wearing magnetic boots.
- Gravity boots?
- Dr. McCoy.
Would you be so good as to tell me what is your current medical status?
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
You have a singular wit, Doctor.
For 27 years I've been surgeon aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.
In three months I stand down.
You know...
I believe that you consumed rather a generous amount of Romulan ale in the officers mess on the night in question.
- Objection.
- Sustained.
We all did.
All of us.
That doesn't mean...
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
Barely.
Now be careful, Doctor.
Have you ever in your past saved patients as barely alive as he?
I didn't have the medical knowledge I needed for Klingon anatomy.
- I see.
- You where there.
You say you are due for retirement.
May I ask, do your hands shake?
- Objection!
- I was nervous.
No.
You were incompetent.
You were incompetent!
Whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink.
- The court will have to determine.
- My God, man.
I tried to save him!
I tried to save him.
I was desperate to save him.
He was the last best hope in the Universe for peace.
The witness is excused.
There we have it, citizens.
We have established the particulars of the crime.
And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair.
James Tiberius Kirk.
What would your favorite author say, Captain?
"Let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings."
Tell us your sad story, Kirk.
Tell us that you planned to take revenge for the death of your son.
- That's not true.
- Objection!
Captain Kirk has not been identified as the assassin.
I offer into the record this excerpt from the Captain's personal log.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I've never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I've never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Are those your words?
Those words were spoken by me.
Objection!
My client's political views are not on trial.
On the contrary.
Captain Kirk's views are at the very heart of the matter.
His record shows him to be an insubordinate, unprincipled opportunist with a history of violating the chain of command whenever it suited him.
Continue.
The record shows that Captain Kirk once held the rank of Admiral and he was broken for taking matters into his own hands.
Do you deny being demoted for these charges.
Answer me now!
- I cannot deny it.
- You were demoted?
- For insubordination?
- On occasion, I have disobeyed orders.
Were you obeying or disobeying orders when you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?
I didn't know about it until we boarded the ship.
You still deny the Enterprise fired on Kronos One?
And you still deny your men beamed aboard and shot the Chancellor?
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I didn't witness.
Are you aware that as the captain of a ship, you are responsible for the actions of your men?
I am.
If it's proved that members of your crew carried out the assassination...
- They're setting us up.
Your Honors!
- Do not answer.
Captain Kirk, you will answer the question.
As Captain I'm responsible for the crew under my command.
Your Honors, the state rests.
Send to Commander Enterprise.
"We stand ready to assist you.
Captain Sulu, U.S.S. Excelsior."
It is the determination of this court that the prisoners are guilty as charged.
I wish to note for the record that all the evidence is circumstantial.
I beg the court to consider this when pronouncing its sentence.
So noted.
Captain James T. Kirk, Dr. Leonard McCoy.
In the interest of fostering amity for the forthcoming peace talks, the sentence of death is commuted.
It is the judgment of this court that, without possibility of reprieve or parole, you be taken from this place to the dilithium mines on the penal asteroid of Rura Penthe.
There to spend the rest of your natural lives.
Rura Penthe!
Known throughout the galaxy as the alien's graveyard.
Better to kill them now and get it over with.
Lieutenant.
The torpedo hit once again, please.
Hold.
It is Enterprise.
We fired.
That is not possible!
All weapons visually accounted for, sir.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains must be the truth.
What does that mean?
That if we cannot have fired those torpedoes, someone else did.
They didn't fire on themselves and there are no other ships present.
- There was a neutron surge.
- Not from us.
A neutron surge that big could only be produced by another ship.
- Kronos One?
- Too far away.
Very near us.
Possibly beneath us.
If there were a ship beneath us, the Klingons would have seen it.
Would they?
- A Bird of Prey?
- A Bird of Prey.
- Cloaked?
- They can't fire when they're cloaked.
All things being equal, I would agree.
However, things are not equal.
This one can.
- We must inform Starfleet Command.
- Of what?
A new weapon that's invisible?
They'll call us raving lunatics.
They'll say we'll say anything to exonerate the Captain.
And they would be correct.
We have no evidence.
Only a theory which happens to fit the facts.
Assuming you're right.
Why would they fire on their own President?
Indeed.
This ship will be searched from bow to stern.
I do not understand.
If there was a ship underneath us surely the assassins beamed aboard from that vessel, not Enterprise.
You're forgetting something, Mr. Chekov.
According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
If we did, the killers are here.
If we did not, whoever altered the data banks is here.
In either case, what we are looking for is here.
- What are we looking for, sir?
- Lieutenant.
Two pairs of gravity boots.
This is the gulag Rura Penthe.
There is no stockades, no guard tower, no electronic frontier.
Only a magnetic shield prevents beaming.
Punishment means exile from prison to the surface.
On the surface, nothing can survive.
Work well, and you will be treated well.
Work badly, and you will die.
Oh, my God!
The universal translator has been confiscated.
I'm sorry?
He's definitely on about something, Jim.
If this is your spot, we'll move on.
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
- He's got it.
- And your coat.
I'm afraid not.
It wouldn't fit.
- Thanks.
- This will help keep you warm.
- I'm Martia.
You're Kirk and McCoy.
- How did you know that?
We don't get many presidential assassins.
- We didn't kill Gorkon.
- Of course not.
- But there's a reward for your death.
- That figures.
We've been set up.
Somebody up there wants you out of the way.
- Any progress?
- None.
A crew of 300 are looking everywhere, but the killers may still be among them.
Surely they have disposed of these boots by now.
Would it not have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
Logic must give way to physics.
Gravity wasn't restored when they escaped.
Without the boots, they would have floated off the transporter pads.
Why not simply vaporize them?
Like this?
As you know, no one can fire an unauthorized phaser aboard a starship.
Suppose, when they returned, they threw the boots into the refuse.
I'm having the refuse searched.
If I'm correct, those boots will cling to the killer's necks like Tiberian bats.
They couldn't escape without them nor throw them out the window.
Those boots are here.
Somewhere.
- Did someone fire off a phaser?
- It's alright.
It's nothing.
Mr. Spock, Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
- Who fired the...
- Ah, Mr. Scott.
I hear you have difficulty with the warp drive.
How long do you need for repair?
There's nothing wrong with the bloody thing.
If we return to space dock, the killers can dispose of their footwear and we will never see the Captain or Dr. McCoy alive again.
- It could take weeks.
- Thank you.
Val'eris, inform Starfleet our warp drive is inoperative.
- A lie?
- An error.
We have lost all contact with the Captain and Dr. McCoy.
Yes, at the moment they're surrounded by a magnetic shield.
But if I know the Captain, he is deep into planning his escape.
You've got him where you want him, Jim!
- Are you alright?
- I think so.
- They'll respect you now.
- I was lucky that thing had knees.
That was not his knee.
Not everybody keep their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Anything you want to tell me?
See what you can do for him.
Let him know we're not holding a grudge.
Suppose he's holding a grudge?
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
- Do you want to get out of here?
- There's got to be a way.
Three months before retirement.
What a way to finish.
- We're not finished.
- Speak for yourself.
One day, one night...
Kobayashi Maru!
Bones!
Are you afraid of the future?
I believe that was the general idea that I was trying to convey.
- I don't mean this future.
- What is this - multiple choice?
Some people are afraid...
of what might happen.
- I was terrified.
- What terrified you, specifically?
No more Neutral Zone.
I was used to hating Klingons.
It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word.
- Spock was right.
- We all felt exactly the same.
No.
Somebody felt a lot worse.
I'm beginning to understand why.
If you've got any bright ideas, now is the time.
Time is the problem.
You and I are nothing.
You heard the judge - the peace conference is on again.
Whoever killed Gorkon is bound to attempt another assassination.
Unless we can get out of here.
It's me
- Martia.
Listen.
No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
- Except us.
- It is possible.
I know how to get outside the shield.
- How do we fit in?
- Getting outside the shield is easy.
After that, you have to get us off the surface before we freeze.
Can you?
- It's possible.
- I can't make it alone.
You're the likeliest candidate to come here for months.
Candidate for what?
Go to lift 7 in the morning for mining duty.
I'll see you there.
Don't disappoint me.
- What is it with you, anyway?
- Still think we're finished?
More than ever.
Sorry to wake you, sir.
Starfleet requests any data we have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
What?
They're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to space dock, sir.
Signal Starfleet that we have no idea location Enterprise.
- Sir?
- You have hearing problems?
No, sir.
Klingon blood.
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
This is the first evidence which corroborates our theory.
Now we go to Starfleet?
We expand our search to include uniforms.
All uniforms?
Clear, sir.
Make a hole.
Coming through.
Coming through.
Sir!
Sir!
- I think we've been had.
- No, you weren't, Doctor.
Get off at the first level.
Follow the gang into the mine.
They don't take girls.
- You are crewman Dax?
- Yes.
What is the problem?
Perhaps you know the Russian epic of Cinderella?
If shoe fits - wear it.
Mr. Chekov...
Watch me.
What kind of creature is this?
Last night you two were...
Get in.
Come on.
We don't have a lot of time.
Hurry!
Up there.
Come on - climb!
Here, you'll need these.
Quickly!
Stay close.
- There they are.
- They emerge from the beaming shield.
Mr. Scott, start your engines.
Mr. Chekov, set course for Rura Penthe.
Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe is deep inside the Klingon frontier.
- If we're discovered...
- Correct.
We need a feat of linguistic legerdemain and intrepidity before the Captain and Dr. McCoy freeze to death.
- Leave me, I'm finished.
- No!
Bones, I'm wearing a viridium patch on my back.
Spock slapped it there before we went on Gorkon's ship.
That cunning little Vulcan.
Come on!
We're in the clear.
Now that we're outside the shield, they can locate us two sectors away.
If they're even looking for us.
We must respond.
A universal translator would be recognized.
"What is your destination, over?"
Would you mind explaining that little trick you do?
- I'm a Chameloid.
- I've heard about you.
Shape-shifters.
I thought you were mythical.
Give a girl a chance, Captain.
It takes a lot of effort.
I don't doubt it.
Stop me if I'm wrong, but do we have any way of knowing whether this is the real you?
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.
We're outside the shield.
Now it's your turn, Captain.
If you say so.
Are you crazy?
!
She didn't need our help.
Where did you get these convenient clothes?
Don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue.
It's to let them know where we are.
Ask her what she's getting in return.
A full pardon... which doesn't cover this.
An accident wasn't good enough.
Come on, Spock.
Good enough for one.
Two would have looked suspicious.
Killed while attempting escape.
That's convincing for both.
Surprise!
- Your friends are late.
- They'll be along.
- I can't believe I kissed you.
- Must have been your lifelong ambition.
Isn't it time you became something else?
I like it here.
Well, well, well...
What took you so long?
Kill him, he's the one.
Not me, you idiot - him!
- No witnesses.
- Killed while trying to escape.
- Damned clever, if you ask me.
- It's a classic.
- That's what he wanted.
- Who?
Who wanted us killed?
Since you're all going to die anyway, why not tell you?
His name is...
Damn it!
What the hell!
Son of a!
Couldn't you have waited two seconds?
He was about to explain the whole thing.
- You want to go back?
- Absolutely not!
This is the bridge.
We're still in Klingon space.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
The Klingons have a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked.
- She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
- So that's it.
We believe that Gorkon's murderers are aboard this ship.
- Has the peace conference begun?
- Who knows?
The location is secret.
- There's always something.
- Captain!
Mr. Spock!
I found the uniforms with the Klingon blood on them.
But the uniforms belong to these two men.
Burke and Samno.
Not anymore.
Phaser on "stun" at close range.
First rule of assassination - kill the assassins.
- Now we're back to square one.
- Can I talk to you?
- Why weren't they vaporized?
- It would set off the alarm.
It's possible.
Now hear this.
Now hear this.
Court reporter to sick bay.
Code blue - urgent.
Statements to be taken at once from Yeomen Burke and Samno.
Repeat, court reporter to sick bay.
Code blue - urgent.
Statements to be taken.
Repeat, statements to be taken from Yeomen Burke and Samno.
You have to shoot.
If you are logical, you have to shoot.
- I do not want to.
- What you want is irrelevant.
What you've chosen is at hand.
I'd just as soon you didn't.
The operation is over.
I did not fire.
You cannot prove anything.
Yes, I can.
At my trial my personal log was used against me.
How long did you wait outside my quarters before I noticed you?
You knew?
I tried to tell you, but you would not listen.
Neither of us was hearing very well that night.
There were things I tried to tell you, about having faith.
You have betrayed the Federation.
All of you.
- And what have you've been doing?
- Saving Starfleet.
Klingons cannot be trusted.
Sir...
You said so yourself.
They killed your son.
Did you not wish Gorkon dead?
"Let them die", you said.
Did I misinterpret you?
And you were right.
They conspired with us to assassinate their own Chancellor.
How trustworthy can they be?
Klingons and Federation members conspiring together.
- Who is "us"?
- All who stands to lose from peace.
Names, Lieutenant.
My comrades will make certain all your transmissions are jammed.
- Names, Lieutenant!
- I do not remember.
A lie?
A choice.
Spock.
Admiral Cartwright.
From Starfleet?
Who else?
General...
Chang.
- Who else?
- Romulan Ambassador and others.
Where is the peace conference?
Where is the peace conference?
She does not know.
Then we're dead.
I have been dead before.
Contact Excelsior.
- She'll have the co-ordinates.
- I've already got it, sir.
- Standing by, Captain Kirk.
- Sulu.
You realize that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations.
I'm sorry, Captain.
Your message is breaking up.
Bless you, Sulu.
Where is the peace conference?
They'll attempt another assassination.
It's at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border.
I'm sending the co-ordinates on a coded frequency.
We'll need more than that.
There's a Bird of Prey on the look-out for us that can fire while cloaked.
Surely not.
How many of those things are there?
Come on, Lieutenant.
- Just the prototype.
- Do you hear that?
I'm getting under way now.
We're in Alpha Quadrant.
The chances of our reaching the conference in time are slim.
- When does this conference start?
- According to my information - today.
- Thank you, Captain Sulu.
- Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
Spock?
I prefer it dark.
- Dining on ashes?
- You were right.
It was arrogant presumption on my part that got us into this situation.
You and the Doctor might have been killed.
The night is young.
You said it yourself, it was logical.
Peace is worth a few personal risks.
You're a great one for logic.
I'm a great one for rushing in where angels fear to tread.
We're both extremists.
Reality is probably somewhere in between.
I couldn't get past the death of my son.
I was prejudiced by her accomplishments as a Vulcan.
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was.
Is it possible that we two, you and I, have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?
Would that constitute a joke?
- It wasn't your fault.
- I was responsible.
- For no actions but your own.
- That's not what you said at your trial.
That was as captain of the ship.
Human beings...
We both know that I am not human.
Do you want to know something?
Everybody's human.
I find that remark... insulting.
Come, I need you.
Madam Chancellor, members of the diplomatic corps honored guests.
The United Federation of Planets welcomes you to Camp Khitomer.
She's out here somewhere.
- But if she's cloaked...
- Then all we have is a radiation surge.
By the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes.
2.06... 2.03...
- Close enough to beam down?
- Not yet.
In two minutes. 1.58.
Go to impulse power for Khitomer.
Let us redefine progress to mean that just because we can do a thing it does not necessarily follow that we must do that thing.
- Uhura?
- Nothing, Captain.
If she's here, she's rigged for silent running.
Coming up on transporter range in 57 seconds.
Transporter room.
Stand by to beam down.
53... 48 seconds.
44...
I can see you, Kirk.
Chang.
Can you see me?
Now be honest, Captain.
Warrior to warrior.
You do prefer it this way, don't you?
As it was meant to be.
No peace in our time.
"Once more unto the breach, dear friends."
- This is fun.
- Reverse engines.
All astern.
One and a half impulse power.
Back off!
What's she waiting for?
Probably attempting to ascertain why we are reversing.
Wondering whether we detect her.
Incoming!
- In range?
- Not yet, sir.
Come on!
- She'll fly apart.
- Fly her apart, then!
Many speculated about my father's motives.
Some said he was an idealist.
Others said he had no choice.
If Praxis had not exploded, his idealism wouldn't have found expression.
We are a proud race.
We are here because we intend to go on being proud.
- Go to auxiliary power!
- Auxiliary circuits destroyed.
"Tickle us, do we not laugh?
Prick us, do we not bleed?"
"Wrong us, shall we not revenge?"
Gas.
Gas, Captain.
Under impulse power she expands fuel, like all vessels.
We call it "plasma", but it is merely ionized gas.
What about our equipment to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
The thing's got to have a tail-pipe.
Doctor, would you assist me in performing surgery on a torpedo?
Fascinating.
Hard to starboard.
The proposed agenda is as follows:
The evacuation of Kronos has been calculated within the 50 Earth year time span.
Phase 1- preparation for evacuation...
Captain, she's packing quite a wallop.
Shields weakening.
Shields up!
Alright, now we're giving them something else to shoot at.
The game's afoot.
- Excelsior's been hit!
- "Our revels now are ended", Kirk.
"Cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war."
- Bones, where's my torpedo?
- Bet you wished you'd stayed in bed.
Shields collapsing!
The key, please.
Time is short.
- The hull has been compromised.
- I wonder how bad.
Connect echo-bars.
...discuss the report on phase 2.
- Alter circuit A.
- Sensor.
...we commence within minutes of the preparation.
- "I am constant as the Northern star."
- I'd give real money, if he'd shut up.
Plate, please.
...and assimilation will consume...
We've got a heart beat.
...with the Klingon Empire...
Key, please.
- Where's that torpedo?
- She's ready.
Lock and load!
Fire!
"To be... or not" "to be."
Target that explosion and fire.
Fire!
This work will occupy us throughout most of the week.
I hope that the delegation can implement the provisions of Phase 1 by the first of next month.
As you know, time is of the essence.
Out of the way!
Mr. President!
Mr. President!
Kirk, Enterprise.
- Arrest those men!
- Arrest yourself!
We've got a full confession.
- This is not Klingon blood.
- Cartwright.
Just a minute.
It's Colonel West!
What's happened?
What's the mean of all of this?
It's about the future, Madam Chancellor.
Some people think the future means the end of history.
We haven't run out of history quite yet.
Your father called the future "the undiscovered country".
People can be very frightened of change.
You've restored my father's faith.
And you've restored my son's.
Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
And they're not going to prosecute.
They could have prosecuted me.
I felt like Val'eris.
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
And it's a good thing, too.
If they did, we'd all have to turn ourselves in.
- Captain Kirk.
- Captain Sulu.
As much to the crew of the Enterprise, I owe you my thanks.
Nice to see you in action one more time, Captain Kirk.
Take care.
- My God, that's a big ship.
- Not so big as her captain.
So...
This is goodbye?
It's about time we got underway ourselves.
Captain, I have orders from Starfleet Command.
We're to put back to space dock immediately... to be decommissioned.
If I were human, I believe my response would be:
"Go to hell."
If I were human.
Course heading, Captain?
Second star to the right.
And straight on 'til morning.
Captain's log, stardate 9529.1.
This is the final cruise of the Starship Enterprise under my command.
This ship, and her history will shortly become the care of another crew.
To them and their posterity will we commit our future.
They'll continue the voyages we have begun and journey to all the undiscovered countries boldly going where no man, where no one has gone before.
Star Trek VI
Stardate 9521.6.
Captain's log U.S.S. Excelsior.
Hikaru Sulu commanding.
After three years I've concluded my first assignment as master of this vessel cataloguing gaseous planetary anomalies in Beta Quadrant.
We're heading home under full impulse power.
I'm pleased to report that ship and crew have functioned well.
According to this, we've completed our survey of the entire sector.
I have an energy wave at 240 degrees mark six port.
Visual!
My...
God!
Shields.
Shields!
She's not answering her helm.
Starboard thrusters.
Turn her into the wave.
Go to impulse power.
- Damage report.
- Checking all systems.
- That was no meteor shower.
- Negative, sir.
The sub-space shock-wave originated at bearing 323.75.
Location...
It's Praxis, sir.
It's a Klingon moon.
Praxis is their key energy production facility.
Send to Klingon High Command. "This is Excelsior, a Federation Starship."
"We have monitored a large explosion in your sector."
- "Do you require assistance?"
- Aye, sir.
Mr Vultane, any more data?
I've confirmed Praxis' location, but...
What is?
- I cannot confirm Praxis' existence.
- On screen.
- Magnify.
- Computer enhancement.
- Praxis?
- What's left of it, sir.
Captain, I'm getting a message from Praxis.
Let's have it.
This is Brigadier Kerla, speaking for the High Command.
There has been an incident on Praxis.
However, everything is under control.
We have no need for assistance.
Obey treaty stipulations and remain outside the Neutral Zone.
This transmission ends now.
- An incident?
- Do we report this, sir?
Are you kidding?
Starfleet Headquartes
What are we doing here?
That suits me.
I just bought a boat.
I'm supposed to be chairing a seminar at the Academy.
- Isn't this just for top brass?
- Where is Sulu?
Captain Sulu?
On assignment.
Where's Spock?
This briefing is classified.
Ladies and gentlemen, the C-in-C.
As you were.
I'll break this information down succinctly.
The Klingon empire has 50 years of life left.
For full details, I'm turning this briefing over to Federation Special Envoy.
Good morning.
Two months ago a Federation Starship monitored an explosion on Praxis.
We believe it was caused by over-mining and insufficient safety precautions.
The moon's decimation means deadly pollution of their ozone.
They will have depleted their oxygen supply in 50 Earth years.
Due to their enormous military budget the Klingon economy doesn't have the resources to combat this catastrophe.
Last month, at the behest of the Vulcan Ambassador, -
- I opened a dialogue with Gorkon, Chancellor of the Klingon High Council.
He proposes to commence negotiations at once.
Negotiations for what?
The dismantling of our space stations and bases along the Neutral Zone, an end to 70 years of hostility, which the Klingons can no longer afford.
Bill, are we talking about mothballing the Starfleet?
Our exploration and scientific programs would be unaffected, but...
I must protest!
To offer Klingons safe haven within Federation space is suicide.
Klingons would become the alien trash of the galaxy.
If we dismantle the fleet, we'd be defenceless before an aggressive species on our territory.
The opportunity here is to bring them to their knees.
Then we'll be in a better position to dictate terms.
- Sir...
- Captain Kirk?
The Klingons have never been trustworthy.
I agree with Admiral Cartwright.
This is a terrifying idea.
It is imperative that we act now to support the Gorkon initiative, lest more conservative elements persuade his empire that it's better to attempt a military solution and die fighting.
You, Captain Kirk, are to be our first olive branch.
We are to rendezvous with the vessel which is bringing Gorkon to Earth and to escort him safely through Federation space.
Me?
There are Klingons who feel the same about the peace treaty as yourself, but they'll think twice about attacking the Enterprise under your command.
I have personally vouched for you in this matter.
You have personally vouched...?
You will extend Chancellor Gorkon full diplomatic courtesy, Captain.
- A full Ambassador is better equipped...
- If there's no further business I wish you and your crew Godspeed.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
I remind you this meeting is classified.
I don't know whether to congratulate you or not, Jim.
I wouldn't.
We volunteered?
There's an old Vulcan proverb.
"Only Nixon could go to China."
How could you vouch for me?
- That's arrogant presumption.
- My father requested that I open...
I know your father is the Vulcan Ambassador, but you know how I feel.
- They're animals.
- Jim...
- There is an historic opportunity here.
- Don't believe them!
Don't trust them.
- They're dying.
- Let them die.
Has it occurred to you that this crew is due to stand down in three months?
We've done our bit for king and country.
You should have trusted me.
Control, this is S-D 103, approach to Space dock.
Over.
You are clear to deliver Captain Kirk and party to N.C.C. 1701 Alpha.
- Captain on the bridge!
- As you were.
Lieutenant?
Val'eris, sir.
We were told you needed a helmsman, so I volunteered.
It is agreeable to see you again.
She was the first Vulcan to graduate at the top of her class at the Academy.
- You must be very proud.
- I don't believe so, sir.
She's a Vulcan, alright.
Let's get this over with.
Departure stations.
- Scotty?
Did you find the engine room?
- Right where I left it.
Stand by.
Uhura, get me the dock master.
Control tower reading, sir.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
This is Control.
Permission to depart granted. 30 seconds for port gates.
- Clear all moorings.
- Awaiting port gates from this mark.
- All lines clear.
- Aft thrusters.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
1 quarter impulse power.
Captain, regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock.
Jim...
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
Aye, sir.
Captain's log.
Stardate 9522.6.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I can never forgive them for the death of my boy.
To escort the Chancellor of the Klingon High Council to a peace summit is problematic, at best.
Spock says this could be an historic occasion.
I'd like to believe him.
But how on Earth can history get past people like me?
- Sorry.
- You could have knocked.
We are almost at the rendezvous, sir.
I thought that you would like to know.
Permission to speak freely, sir.
It is an honour to serve with you.
You piloted well out of space dock, Lieutenant.
I've always wanted to try that.
You've done well, Val'eris.
As your sponsor at the Academy I've followed your career with satisfaction.
And as a Vulcan, you have exceeded my expectations.
I do not understand this representation.
It's a depiction from ancient Earth mythology.
"The expulsion from Paradise."
- Why keep it in your quarters?
- To remind me that all things end.
It is of endings that I wish to speak.
Sir, I address you as a kindred intellect.
Do you not recognise that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
History is replete with turning points.
You must have faith.
- Faith?
- The universe will unfold as it should.
- Is that logical?
Surely we must...
- Logic, logic, logic.
Logic is the beginning of wisdom, Val'eris.
Not the end.
This will be my final voyage on board this vessel as a member of her crew.
Nature abhors a vacuum.
I intend you to replace me.
I could only succeed you, sir.
Now hear this.
All offiicers to the bridge.
Klingon battle cruiser off the port bow.
All Officers to the bridge.
Captain on the bridge!
Shall we raise our shields, Captain?
I've never been this close.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
- Uhura, hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Right standard rudder.
Bring us alongside.
Right standard rudder.
Z plus 5 degrees.
Channel is open, Captain.
This is the Starship Enterprise.
Captain James T. Kirk commanding.
This is Kronos One.
I am Chancellor Gorkon.
We've been ordered to escort you to your meeting on Earth.
Thank you.
Would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard the Enterprise as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We would be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 19:30 hours.
I shall look forward to that.
I hope you're happy.
Captain!
There is a supply of Romulan ale aboard.
It might make the evening pass more... smoothly.
Officer thinking, Lieutenant.
Guess who's coming to dinner.
Energize.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- Captain Kirk.
May I present Captain Spock, whom I believe you know.
Captain, face to face at last.
You have my thanks.
Chancellor.
Gentlemen.
This is my daughter, Azetbur...
My military advisor, Brigadier Kerla...
General Chang, my chief of staff.
I have so wanted to meet you, Captain.
- I'm not sure how to take that.
- Sincere admiration, Kirk.
From one warrior to another.
Right...
This way.
You might enjoy a brief tour.
- They all look alike.
- What about that smell?
You know only top of the line models can even talk...
- You men have work?
- Yes, ma'am.
Then snap to it.
I offer a toast.
The undiscovered country.
- The future.
- The undiscovered country.
Hamlet, act 3, scene 1 .
You have not experienced Shake- speare until you've read him in Klingon.
Captain Kirk.
I thought Romulan ale was illegal.
An advantage of being 1,000 light years from Federation headquarters.
To you, Chancellor Gorkon.
One of the architects of our future.
Chancellor!
Perhaps we are looking at something of that future here.
Tell me, Captain Kirk.
Would you be willing to give up Starfleet?
The Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace.
I wouldn't dispute my first officer.
Starfleet has always been...
There's no need to mince words.
In space, all warriors are cold warriors.
General, are you fond of...
Shakespeare?
We believe all planets have a sovereign claim to inalienable human rights.
"Inalien..." If you could only hear yourselves.
"Human rights." Why, the very name is racist.
The Federation is a "homo sapiens only" club.
Present company excepted, of course.
We know where this is leading - the annihilation of our culture.
That's not true.
No!
"To be or not to be"...
That is the question which preoccupies our people.
- We need breathing room.
- Earth.
Hitler, 1938.
I beg your pardon.
Well...
I see we have a long way to go.
We must do this again sometime.
You don't trust me, do you?
I don't blame you.
If there is to be a brave new world, our generation is going to have the hardest time living in it.
- Captain Spock.
- Chancellor.
Madam.
Captain.
Well, most kind.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
Hmm, Captain?
"Have we not heard the chimes at midnight?"
Thank God!
- Did you see the way they ate?
- Terrible table manners.
I doubt our own behaviour will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy.
I'm going to sleep this off.
Is there any other way we can screw up tonight?
I'm going to go find a pot of black coffee.
The Enterprise hosted Chancellor Gorkon to dinner last night.
Our manners weren't exactly Emily Post.
To the galley
- Romulan ale no longer to be served at diplomatic functions.
Captain Kirk, will you please join me on the bridge?
Captain Kirk?
- Captain.
- What is it?
- I find this curious.
- Spock, I'm really tired.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
Where?
It appears to emanate from us.
The Enterprise?
Val'eris, do you know anything about a radiation surge?
Chekov?
Only the size of my head.
I know what you mean.
- What's happened?
- We've fired on the Chancellor's ship.
Torpedo room!
Please confirm, have we fired?
- Uhura, monitor.
- Aye, sir.
- Direct hit.
- Confirmed, sir.
We've lost gravity!
We are betrayed!
This is the bridge.
Do you read me?
- Did we fire those torpedoes?
- Negative.
We're still fully loaded.
Find Chang.
Unable to confirm or deny firing the torpedoes.
- Hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Kronos One, this is Enterprise.
Do you read?
It's very hard to make out.
There's been weapons firing and a lot of shouting.
- She's still listing.
- She's spinning out of control.
Restoring auxiliary gravity...
Have you not a shred of decency in you, Kirk?
We come in peace, and you blatantly defy that peace.
For that, I shall blow you out of the stars.
- We haven't fired.
- Captain...
According to our data banks, we have.
Twice...
Captain, they're coming about.
- They're preparing to fire.
- Shields up, Captain?
- Captain, our shields.
- Shields up, Captain?
Signal our surrender.
We surrender!
- This is Enterprise.
We surrender.
- If they fire, with our shields down...
- ...we will not be able to respond.
- Repeat, Enterprise surrenders.
- Are we firing torpedoes?
- I wish I knew.
There is look like
- I'm going aboard.
Spock, take the con.
- I involved you, I will go.
No, I'll go.
We'll not be the instigators of war on the eve of universal peace.
I'm going too, they may need a doctor.
Uhura, tell them we're coming, and tell them we're unarmed.
- Have you lost your mind?
!
- I don't understand what's happened.
We're here to help.
Follow me.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- My God!
What has happened here?
- You dare to feign ignorance?
- What happened?
With a direct torpedo hit, you crippled our gravitational field and two of your Starfleet crew beamed aboard wearing magnetic boots.
- Aren't you carrying a surgeon?
- We were until this disgrace.
Then for god's sake, let me help.
I've got a pulse - we can move him.
I need light.
Put him on the table.
Hold him!
Hold him while I stabilize him.
I said hold him!
Sweet Jesus.
- Can you...?
- I don't even know his anatomy.
- His wounds are not closing.
- He's killing him!
He's gone into some kind of damned arrest.
Come on, dammit!
Come on!
He's not responding.
Don't let it end this way, Captain.
Under article 184 of your Interstellar Law I'm placing you under arrest.
You're charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
He tried to save him.
They've been arrested.
Mr Spock, we've got to do something.
I assume command of this ship as of 02:30 hours.
Commander Uhura, notify Starfleet headquarters and request instructions.
We cannot allow them to be taken to Kronos as prisoners.
Opening fire will not retrieve them, and we must avoid an armed conflict.
We will be able to follow the Captain's movements.
- How did you achieve this?
- Time is precious.
We must piece together what happened here tonight.
According to our data bank, this ship fired those torpedoes.
- No way!
- I sympathize, but we need evidence.
Please accompany me.
And if we cannot piece together what happened?
What then, sir?
In that case, Mr Chekov, it resides in the purview of the diplomats.
The Chancellor of the High Council is dead!
The result of an unprovoked attack while he travelled to see you under a flag of truce on a mission of peace!
Captain Kirk was legally arrested for the crime.
He and Dr. McCoy boarded Kronos One of their own free will.
- None of these facts are in dispute.
- I have ordered an investigation.
- In the meantime...
- In the meantime we expect the Federation to abide by the articles of Interstellar Law.
Kirk and Dr. McCoy will stand trial for the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon.
Out of the question.
Ambassador Sarek, can we get them extradited?
I share a measure of personal responsibility in this matter, but I am obliged to confirm my esteemed colleagues legal interpretation.
What is the position of the Romulan government?
I must concur with my colleagues.
You can't believe that Kirk assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council.
Mr President.
I don't know what to believe.
I'm waiting for your answer, sir.
This President is not above the law.
Mr President, Starfleet command is here from San Francisco.
Bill, Admiral Cartwright, please sit down.
Mr President, we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
I'm constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
Sir, would you please take a look at this.
We prepared Operation Retrieve based on the danger of terrorism between the Klingon empire and the Federation.
We can go in, rescue the hostages and get out in 24 hours with acceptable losses.
- We have the technology...
- Yes, yes.
But suppose you precipitate a full-scale war?
Then, quite frankly, we can clean their chronometers.
Mr President, they are vulnerable.
There will never be a better time.
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be.
I'll bear that in mind.
Thank you, gentlemen, that's all for now.
Mr President.
Sir...
Those men have literally saved this planet.
And now they're going to save it again.
By standing trial.
Report back on the double.
Do you read?
- We're to report back at once.
- We can't abandon Kirk and McCoy.
Of course not.
400 years ago, on Earth, workers who felt their livelyhood threatened flung their wooden shoes called "sabots" into the machines to stop them.
Hence the word "sabotage".
We experience technical malfunction.
All back-up systems inoperative.
Excellent.
I mean... too bad.
Mr President, I have been named chancellorin my father's place.
Madam Chancellor, you have my condolences on your loss.
I assure you that this shameful deed will not...
Let us come to the point.
You want this conference to go forward.
I will attend in one week, on one condition.
We will not extradite the prisoners, and you will not attempt to rescue them.
We would consider any such attempt an act of war.
We hope you'll be our guest here on Earth.
After recent events, you will understand if I prefer a neutral site.
And in the interest of security, let us keep the location secret for now.
As you wish, Madam Chancellor.
Attack them now, while we still can.
Attack or be slaves in their world.
We can take whole by force, what they propose to divide.
War is obsolete, General.
As we are in danger of becoming.
Better to die on our feet than live on our knees.
That wasn't what my father wanted.
Your father was killed for what he wanted.
The peace process will go forward.
Kirk...
Kirk will pay for my father's death.
It is as I said, Mr Spock.
Inventory registers every torpedo.
Yet the data banks insist we fired.
- One computer is lying.
- A computer doesn't lie!
Precisely.
Therefore we must inspect each torpedo visually.
That could take hours!
And if they're all there?
Then someone forged an entry in the data banks.
Gorkon's daughter has been named Chancellor.
It was on the news.
I'll bet that bitch killed her father.
- Her own father?
- It is an old story, sir.
They don't place the same value on life as we do, you know that.
Take my word, she did not shed one bloody tear.
Hardly conclusive, since Klingons have no tear-ducts.
Lieutenant, any response from Starfleet since our dispatch?
Yes, sir.
And?
Commander Uhura is experiencing technical difficulties, sir.
Curious.
Very well.
For 24 hours, we will agree this conversation didn't take place.
- A lie?
- An omission.
In 24 hours we won't have a clue where Captain Kirk is.
- I know precisely where he will be.
- You do?
Where?
Kirk, Kirk, Kirk, Kirk...
It's a damn show trial.
The Enterprise fired on Kronos One without provocation.
The Chancellor and his advisors having been lulled into a false sense of security by an invitation to a dinner aboard Captain Kirk's vessel at precisely 19:30 hours that same evening.
Call your first witness.
After the first shot we lost our gravitational field.
I was weightless and couldn't function.
Then two Starfleet crewmen came towards me.
Or perhaps they merely wore Starfleet uniforms.
That remark is speculative.
I move that it be stricken.
We're interested in facts, not theories.
If the gravitational unit was not functioning, how could they walk?
They appeared to be wearing magnetic boots.
- Gravity boots...?
- Dr. McCoy.
Would you be so good as to tell me what is your current medical status?
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
You have a singular wit, Doctor.
For 27 years I've been surgeon aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.
In three months I stand down.
You know...
I believe that you consumed rather a generous amount of Romulan ale in the officers mess on the night in question.
- Objection.
- Sustained.
We all did.
All of us.
That doesn't mean...
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
Barely.
Now be careful, Doctor.
Have you ever in your past saved patients as barely alive as he?
I didn't have the medical knowledge I needed for Klingon anatomy.
- I see.
- You where there.
You say you are due for retirement.
May I ask, do your hands shake?
- Objection!
- I was nervous.
No.
You were incompetent.
You were incompetent!
Whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink.
- The court will have to determine.
- My God, man.
I tried to save him!
I tried to save him.
I was desperate to save him.
He was the last best hope in the Universe for peace.
The witness is excused.
There we have it, citizens.
We have established the particulars of the crime.
And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair.
James Tiberius Kirk.
What would your favourite author say, Captain?
"Let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings."
Tell us your sad story, Kirk.
Tell us that you planned to take revenge for the death of your son.
- That's not true.
- Objection!
Captain Kirk has not been identified as the assassin.
Sustained.
I offer into the record this excerpt from the Captain's personal log.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I've never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Again!
Again!
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I've never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Are those your words?
Those words were spoken by me.
Objection!
My client's political views are not on trial.
On the contrary.
Captain Kirk's views are at the very heart of the matter.
His record shows him to be an insubordinate, unprincipled opportunist with a history of violating the chain of command whenever it suited him.
Continue.
The record shows that Captain Kirk once held the rank of Admiral and he was broken for taking matters into his own hands.
Do you deny being demoted for these charges.
Answer me now!
- I cannot deny it.
- You were demoted?
- For insubordination?
- On occasion, I have disobeyed orders.
Were you obeying or disobeying orders when you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?
I didn't know about it until we boarded the ship.
You still deny the Enterprise fired on Kronos One?
Well
And you still deny your men beamed aboard and shot the Chancellor?
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I didn't witness.
Are you aware that as the captain of a ship, you are responsible for the actions of your men?
I am.
If it's proved that members of your crew carried out the assassination...
- They're setting us up.
Your Honours!
- Do not answer.
Captain Kirk, you will answer the question.
As Captain I'm responsible for the crew under my command.
Your Honours, the state rests.
Send to Commander Enterprise.
"We stand ready to assist you.
Captain Sulu, U.S.S. Excelsior."
It is the determination of this court that the prisoners are guilty as charged.
I wish to note for the record that all the evidence is circumstantial.
I beg the court to consider this when pronouncing its sentence.
So noted.
Captain James T. Kirk, Dr. Leonard McCoy.
In the interest of fostering amity for the forthcoming peace talks, the sentence of death is commuted.
It is the judgement of this court that, without possibility of reprieve or parole you be taken from this place to the dilithium mines
- on the penal asteroid of Rura Penthe.
There to spend the rest of your natural lives.
Rura Penthe!
Known throughout the galaxy as the alien's graveyard.
Better to kill them now and get it over with.
Lieutenant.
The torpedo hit once again, please.
Hold.
It is Enterprise.
We fired.
That is not possible!
All weapons visually accounted for, sir.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains must be the truth.
What does that mean?
That if we cannot have fired those torpedoes, someone else did.
They didn't fire on themselves and there are no other ships present.
- There was a neutron surge.
- Not from us.
A neutron surge that big could only be produced by another ship.
- Kronos One?
- Too far away.
Very near us.
Possibly beneath us.
If there were a ship beneath us, the Klingons would have seen it.
Would they?
- A Bird of Prey?
- A Bird of Prey.
- Cloaked?
- They can't fired when they're cloaked.
All things being equal, I would agree.
However, things are not equal.
This one can.
- We must inform Starfleet Command.
- Of what?
A new weapon that's invisible?
They'll call us raving lunatics.
They'll say we'll say anything to exonerate the Captain.
And they would be correct.
We have no evidence.
Only a theory which happens to fit the facts.
Assuming you're right.
Why would they fire on their own President?
Indeed.
This ship will be searched from bow to stern.
I do not understand.
If there was a ship underneath us surely the assassins beamed aboard from that vessel, not Enterprise.
You're forgetting something, Mr Chekov.
According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
If we did, the killers are here.
If we did not, whoever altered the data banks is here.
In either case, what we are looking for is here.
- What are we looking for, sir?
- Lieutenant.
Two pairs of gravity boots.
This is the gulag Rura Penthe.
There is no stockades, no guard tower, no electronic frontier.
Only a magnetic shield prevents beaming.
Punishment means exile from prison to the surface.
On the surface, nothing can survive.
Work well, and you will be treated well.
Work badly, and you will die.
Oh, my God!
The universal translator has been confiscated.
I'm sorry...?
He's definitely on about something, Jim.
If this is your spot, we'll move on.
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
- He's got it.
- And your coat.
I'm afraid not.
It wouldn't fit.
- Thanks.
- This will help keep you warm.
- I'm Martia.
You're Kirk and McCoy.
- How did you know that?
We don't get many presidential assassins.
- We didn't kill Gorkon.
- Of course not.
- But there's a reward for your death.
- That figures.
We've been set up.
Somebody up there wants you out of the way.
- Any progress?
- None.
A crew of 300 are looking everywhere, but the killers may still be among them.
Surely they have disposed of these boots by now.
Would it not have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
Logic must give way to physics.
Gravity wasn't restored when they escaped.
Without the boots, they would have floated off the transporter pads.
Why not simply vaporize them?
Like this?
As you know, no one can fire an unauthorized phaser aboard a starship.
Suppose, when they returned, they threw the boots into the refuse.
I'm having the refuse searched.
If I'm correct, those boots will cling to the killer's necks like Tiberian bats.
They couldn't escape without them nor throw them out the window.
Those boots are here.
Somewhere.
- Did someone fire off a phaser?
- It's alright.
It's nothing.
Mr Spock, Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
- Who fired the...
- Ah, Mr Scott.
I hear you have difficulty with the warp drive.
How long do you need for repair?
There's nothing wrong with the bloody thing.
If we return to space dock, the killers can dispose of their footwear and we will never see the Captain or Dr. McCoy alive again.
- It could take weeks.
- Thank you.
Val'eris, inform Starfleet our warp drive is inoperative.
- A lie?
- An error.
We have lost all contact with the Captain and Dr. McCoy.
Yes, at the moment they're surrounded by a magnetic shield.
But if I know the Captain, he is deep into planning his escape.
You've got him where you want him, Jim!
- Are you alright?
- I think so.
- They'll respect you now.
- I was lucky that thing had knees.
That was not his knee.
Not everybody keep their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Anything you want to tell me?
See what you can do for him.
Let him know we're not holding a grudge.
Suppose he's holding a grudge?
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
- Do you want to get out of here?
- There's got to be a way.
Three months before retirement.
What a way to finish.
- We're not finished.
- Speak for yourself.
One day, one night...
Kobayashi Maru!
Bones!
Are you afraid of the future?
I believe that was the general idea that I was trying to convey.
- I don't mean this future.
- What is this - multiple choice?
Some people are afraid...
of what might happen.
- I was terrified.
- What terrified you, specifically?
No more neutral zone.
I was used to hating Klingons.
It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his words.
- Spock was right.
- We all felt exactly the same.
No.
Somebody felt a lot worse.
I'm beginning to understand why.
If you've got any bright ideas, now is the time.
Time is the problem.
You and I are nothing.
You heard the judge - the peace conference is on again.
Whoever killed Gorkon is bound to attempt another assassination.
Unless we can get out of here.
It's me
- Martia.
Listen.
No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
- Except us.
- It is possible.
I know how to get outside the shield.
- How do we fit in?
- Getting outside the shield is easy.
After that, you have to get us off the surface before we freeze.
Can you?
- It's possible.
- I can't make it alone.
You're the likeliest candidate to come here for months.
Candidate for what?
Go to lift 7 in the morning for mining duty.
I'll see you there.
Don't disappoint me.
- What is it with you, anyway?
- Still think we're finished?
More than ever.
Sorry to wake you, sir.
Starfleet requests any data we have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
What?
They're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to space dock, sir.
Signal Starfleet that we have no idea location Enterprise.
- Sir?
- You have hearing problems?
No, sir.
Klingon blood.
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
This is the first evidence which corroborates our theory.
Now we go to Starfleet?
We expand our search to include uniforms.
All uniforms?
Clear, sir.
Make a hole.
Coming through.
Coming through.
Sir!
Sir!
- I think we've been had.
- No, you weren't, Doctor.
Get off at the first level.
Follow the gang into the mine.
They don't take girls.
- You are crewman Dax?
- Yes.
What is the problem?
Perhaps you know Russian epic of Cinderella?
If shoe fits - wear it.
Mr Chekov...
Watch me.
What kind of creature is this?
Last night you two were...
Don't remenber me.
Get in.
Come on.
We don't have a lot of time.
Hurry!
Up there.
Come on - climb!
Here, you'll need these.
Quickly!
Stay close.
- There they are.
- They emerge from the beaming shield.
Mr Scott, start your engines.
Mr Chekov, set course for Rura Penthe.
Mr Spock, Rura Penthe is deep inside the Klingon frontier.
- If we're discovered...
- Correct.
We need a feat of linguistic legerdemain and intrepidity before the Captain and Dr. McCoy freeze to death.
- Leave me, I'm finished.
- No!
Bones, I'm wearing a viridium patch on my back.
Spock slapped it there before we went on Gorkon's ship.
That cunning little Vulcan.
Come on!
We're in the clear.
Now that we're outside the shield, they can locate us two sectors away.
If they're even looking for us.
This is listening post Morska.
What ship is that, over?
We must respond.
A universal translator would be recognised.
We am thy freighter...
Ursva.
Six weeks out of Kronos.
"What is your destination, over? "
We is condemning food things and supplies.
Don't catch any bugs.
Would you mind explaining that little trick you do?
- I'm a Chameloid.
- I've heard about you.
Shape-shifters.
I thought you were mythical.
Give a girl a chance, Captain.
It takes a lot of effort.
I don't doubt it.
Stop me if I'm wrong, but do we have any way of knowing whether this is the real you?
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.
We're outside the shield.
Now it's your turn, Captain.
If you say so.
Are you crazy?
!
She didn't need our help.
Where did you get these convenient clothes?
Don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue.
It's to let them know where we are.
Ask her what she's getting in return.
A full pardon... which doesn't cover this.
An accident wasn't good enough.
Come on, Spock.
Good enough for one.
Two would have looked suspicious.
Killed while attempting escape.
That's convincing for both.
Surprise!
- Your friends are late.
- They'll be along.
- I can't believe I kissed you.
- Must have been your lifelong ambition.
Isn't it time you became something else?
I like it here.
Well, well, well...
What took you so long?
Kill him, he's the one.
Not me, you idiot - him!
- No witnesses.
- Killed while trying to escape.
- Damned clever, if you ask me.
- It's a classic.
- That's what he wanted.
- Who?
Who wanted us killed?
Since you're all going to die anyway, why not tell you?
His name is...
Damn it!
What the hell!
Son of a...!
Couldn't you have waited two seconds?
He was about to explain the whole thing.
- You want to go back?
- Absolutely not!
This is the bridge.
We're still in Klingon space.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
They were beamed aboard a Federation Starship.
I could trace...
Escaped.
Kirk cannot know the location of the peace conference.
Are you sure?
Will you take that chance?
Helmsman, make course to intercept Enterprise.
The Klingons have a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked.
- She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
- So that's it.
We believe that Gorkon's murderers are aboard this ship.
- Has the peace conference begun?
- Who knows?
The location is secret.
- There's always something.
- Captain!
Mr Spock!
I found the uniforms with the Klingon blood on them.
But the uniforms belong to these two men.
Burke and Samno.
Not anymore.
Phaser on "stun" at close range.
First rule of assassination - kill the assassins.
- Now we're back to square one.
- Can I talk to you?
- Why weren't they vaporized?
- It would set off the alarm.
It's possible.
Now hear this.
Now hear this.
Court reporter to sick bay.
Code blue - urgent.
Statements to be taken at once from Yeomen Burke and Samno.
Repeat, court reporter to sick bay.
Code blue - urgent.
Statements to be taken.
Repeat, statements to be taken from Yeomen Burke and Samno.
You have to shoot.
If you are logical, you have to shoot.
- I do not want to.
- What you want is irrelevant.
What you've chosen is at hand.
I'd just as soon you didn't.
The operation is over.
I did not fire.
You cannot prove anything.
Yes, I can.
At my trial my personal log was used against me.
How long did you wait outside my quarters before I noticed you?
You knew?
I tried to tell you, but you would not listen.
Neither of us was hearing very well that night.
There were things I tried to tell you, about having faith.
You have betrayed the Federation.
All of you.
- And what have you've been doing?
- Saving Starfleet.
Klingons cannot be trusted.
Sir...
You said so yourself.
They killed your son.
Did you not wish Gorkon dead?
"Let them die", you said.
Did I misinterpret you?
And you were right.
They conspired with us to assassinate their own Chancellor.
How trustworthy can they be?
Klingons and Federation members conspiring together.
- Who is "us"?
- All who stands to lose from peace.
Names, Lieutenant.
My comrades will make certain all your transmissions are jammed.
- Names, Lieutenant!
- I do not remember.
A lie?
A choice.
Spock.
Admiral Cartwright.
From Starfleet?
Who else?
General...
Chang.
- Who else?
- Romulan Ambassador and others.
Where is the peace conference?
Where is the peace conference?
She does not know.
Then we're dead.
I have been dead before.
Contact Excelsior.
- She'll have the co-ordinates.
- I've already got it, sir.
- Standing by, Captain Kirk.
- Sulu.
You realize that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations.
I'm sorry, Captain.
Yourmessage is breaking up.
Bless you, Sulu.
Where is the peace conference?
They'll attempt another assassination.
It's at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border.
I'm sending the co-ordinates on a coded frequency.
We'll need more than that.
There's a Bird of Prey on the look-out for us that can fire when cloaked.
Surely not.
How many of those things are there?
Come on, Lieutenant.
- Just the prototype.
- Do you hear that?
I'm getting under way now.
We're in Alpha Quadrant.
The chances of our reaching the conference in time are slim.
- When does this conference start?
- According to my information - today.
- Thank you, Captain Sulu.
- Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
Spock?
I prefer it dark.
- Dining on ashes?
- You were right.
It was arrogant presumption on my part that got us into this situation.
You and the Doctor might have been killed.
The night is young.
You said it yourself, it was logical.
Peace is worth a few personal risks.
You're a great one for logic.
I'm a great one for rushing in where angels fear to tread.
We're both extremists.
Reality is probably somewhere in between.
I couldn't get past the death of my son.
I was prejudiced by her accomplishments as a Vulcan.
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was.
Is it possible that we two, you and I, have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?
Would that constitute a joke?
- It wasn't your fault.
- I was responsible.
- For no actions but your own.
- That's not what you said at your trial.
That was as captain of the ship.
Human beings...
We both know that I am not human.
Do you want to know something?
Everybody's human.
I find that remark... insulting.
Come, I need you.
Madam Chancellor, members of the diplomatic corps honoured guests.
The United Federation of Planets welcomes you to Camp Khitomer.
She's out here somewhere.
- But if she's cloaked...
- Then all we have is a radiation surge.
By the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes.
2.06... 2.03...
- Close enough to beam down?
- Not yet.
In two minutes. 1 .58.
Go to impulse power for Khitomer.
Let us redefine progress to mean that just because we can do a thing it does not necessarily follow that we must do that thing.
- Uhura?
- Nothing, Captain.
If she's here, she's rigged for silent running.
Coming up on transporter range in 57 seconds.
Transporter room.
Stand by to beam down.
53... 48 seconds.
44...
I can see you, Kirk.
Chang.
Can you see me?
Now be honest, Captain.
Warrior to warrior.
You do prefer it this way, don't you?
As it was meant to be.
No peace in our time.
"Once more unto the breach, dearfriends. "
- This is fun.
- Reverse engines.
All astern.
One and a half impulse power.
Back off!
What's she doing?
What's she waiting for?
Probably attempting to ascertain why we are reversing.
Wondering whether we detect her.
Incoming!
- In range?
- Not yet, sir.
Come on!
- She'll fly apart.
- Fly her apart, then!
Many speculated about my father's motives.
Some said he was an idealist.
Others said he had no choice.
If Praxis had not exploded, his idealism wouldn't have found expression.
We are a proud race.
We are here because we intend to go on being proud.
- Go to auxiliary power!
- Auxiliary circuits destroyed.
"Tickle us, do we not laugh?
Prick us, do we not bleed?"
"Wrong us, shall we not revenge?"
Gas.
Gas, Captain.
Under impulse power she expands fuel, like all vessels.
We call it "plasma", but it is merely ionised gas.
What about our equipment to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
The thing's got to have a tail-pipe.
Doctor, would you assist me in performing surgery on a torpedo?
Fascinating.
Hard to starboard.
The proposed agenda is as follows:
The evacuation of Kronos has been calculated within the 50 Earth year time span.
Phase 1 - preparation for evacuation...
Captain, she's packing quite a wallop.
Shields weakening.
Shields up!
Alright, now we're giving them something else to shoot at.
The game's afoot.
- Excelsior's been hit!
- "Our revels now are ended", Kirk.
"Cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war."
- Bones, where's my torpedo?
- Bet you wished you'd stayed in bed.
Shields collapsing!
The key, please.
Time is short.
- The hull has been compromised.
- I wonder how bad.
Connect echo-bars.
...discuss the report on phase 2.
- Alter circuit A.
- Sensor.
...we commence within minutes of the preparation.
- "I am constant as the Northern star."
- I'd give real money, if he'd shut up.
Plate, please.
...and assimilation will consume...
We've got a heart beat.
...with the Klingon Empire...
Key, please.
- Where's that torpedo?
- She's ready.
Lock and load!
Fire!
"To be... or not" "to be."
Target that explosion and fire.
Fire!
This work will occupy us throughout most of the week.
I hope that the delegation can implement the provisions of Phase 1 by the first of next month.
As you know, time is of the essence.
Out of the way!
Mr President!
Mr President!
Kirk, Enterprise.
Protect the Chancellor!
- Arrest those men!
- Arrest yourself!
We've got a full confession.
- This is not Klingon blood.
- Cartwright.
Just a minute.
It's Colonel West!
What's happened?
What's the mean of all of this?
It's about the future, Madam Chancellor.
Some people think the future means the end of history.
We haven't run out of history quite yet.
Your father called the future "the undiscovered country".
People can be very frightened of change.
You've restored my father's faith.
And you've restored my son's.
Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
And they're not going to prosecute.
They could have prosecuted me.
I felt like Val'eris.
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
And it's a good thing, too.
If they did, we'd all have to turn ourselves in.
- Captain Kirk.
- Captain Sulu.
As much to the crew of the Enterprise, I owe you my thanks.
Nice to see you in action one more time, Captain Kirk.
Take care.
- My God, that's a big ship.
- Not so big as her captain.
So...
This is goodbye?
It's about time we got underway ourselves.
Captain, I have orders from Starfleet Command.
We're to put back to space dock immediately... to be decommissioned.
If I were human, I believe my response would be:
"Go to hell."
If I were human.
Course heading, Captain?
Second star to the right.
And straight on 'til morning.
Captain's log, stardate 9529. 1.
This is the final cruise of the Starship Enterprise under my command.
This ship, and her history will shortly become the care of another crew.
To them and their posterity will we commit our future.
They'll continue the voyages we have begun and journey to all the undiscovered countries boldly going where no man, where no one has gone before.
Stardate 9521.6.
Captain's log U.S.S. Excelsior.
Hikaru Sulu commanding.
After three years I've concluded my first assignment as master of this vessel cataloguing gaseous planetary anomalies in Beta Quadrant.
We're heading home under full impulse power.
I'm pleased to report that ship and crew have functioned well.
According to this, we've completed our survey of the entire sector.
I have an energy wave at 240 degrees mark six port.
Visual!
My...
God!
Shields.
Shields!
She's not answering her helm.
Starboard thrusters.
Turn her into the wave.
Go to impulse power.
- Damage report.
- Checking all systems.
- That was no meteor shower.
- Negative, sir.
The sub-space shock-wave originated at bearing 323.75.
Location...
It's Praxis, sir.
It's a Klingon moon.
Praxis is their key energy production facility.
Send to Klingon High Command. "This is Excelsior, a Federation Starship."
"We have monitored a large explosion in your sector."
- "Do you require assistance?"
- Aye, sir.
- Mr Vultane, any more data?
- I've confirmed Praxis' location, but...
- I cannot confirm Praxis' existence.
- On screen.
- Magnify.
- Computer enhancement.
- Praxis?
- What's left of it, sir.
Captain, I'm getting a message from Praxis.
Let's have it.
This is Brigadier Kerla, speaking for the High Command.
There has been an incident on Praxis.
However, everything is under control.
We have no need for assistance.
Obey treaty stipulations and remain outside the Neutral Zone.
This transmission ends now.
- An incident?
- Do we report this, sir?
Are you kidding?
- What are we doing here?
- Maybe it's a retirement party.
That suits me.
I just bought a boat.
I'm supposed to be chairing a seminar at the Academy.
- Isn't this just for top brass?
- Where is Sulu?
Captain Sulu?
On assignment.
Where's Spock?
This briefing is classified.
Ladies and gentlemen, the C-in-C.
As you were.
I'll break this information down succinctly.
The Klingon empire has 50 years of life left.
For full details, I'm turning this briefing over to Federation Special Envoy.
Good morning.
Two months ago a Federation Starship monitored an explosion on Praxis.
We believe it was caused by over-mining and insufficient safety precautions.
The moon's decimation means deadly pollution of their ozone.
They will have depleted their oxygen supply in 50 Earth years.
Due to their enormous military budget the Klingon economy doesn't have the resources to combat this catastrophe.
Last month, at the behest of the Vulcan Ambassador, -
- I opened a dialogue with Gorkon, Chancellor of the Klingon High Council.
He proposes to commence negotiations at once.
Negotiations for what?
The dismantling of our space stations and bases along the Neutral Zone, an end to 70 years of hostility, which the Klingons can no longer afford.
Bill, are we talking about mothballing the Starfleet?
Our exploration and scientific programs would be unaffected, but...
I must protest!
To offer Klingons safe haven within Federation space is suicide.
Klingons would become the alien trash of the galaxy.
If we dismantle the fleet, we'd be defenceless before an aggressive species on our territory.
The opportunity here is to bring them to their knees.
Then we'll be in a better position to dictate terms.
- Sir...
- Captain Kirk?
The Klingons have never been trustworthy.
I agree with Admiral Cartwright.
This is a terrifying idea.
It is imperative that we act now to support the Gorkon initiative, lest more conservative elements persuade his empire that it's better to attempt a military solution and die fighting.
You, Captain Kirk, are to be our first olive branch.
We are to rendezvous with the vessel which is bringing Gorkon to Earth and to escort him safely through Federation space.
Me?
There are Klingons who feel the same about the peace treaty as yourself, but they'll think twice about attacking the Enterprise under your command.
I have personally vouched for you in this matter.
You have personally vouched...?
You will extend Chancellor Gorkon full diplomatic courtesy, Captain.
- A full Ambassador is better equipped...
- If there's no further business I wish you and your crew Godspeed.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
I remind you this meeting is classified.
I don't know whether to congratulate you or not, Jim.
I wouldn't.
We volunteered?
There's an old Vulcan proverb.
"Only Nixon could go to China."
How could you vouch for me?
- That's arrogant presumption.
- My father requested that I open...
I know your father is the Vulcan Ambassador, but you know how I feel.
- They're animals.
- Jim...
- There is an historic opportunity here.
- Don't believe them!
Don't trust them.
- They're dying.
- Let them die.
Has it occurred to you that this crew is due to stand down in three months?
We've done our bit for king and country.
You should have trusted me.
Control, this is S-D 103, approach to Space dock.
Over.
You are clear to deliver Captain Kirk and party to N.C.C. 1701 Alpha.
- Captain on the bridge!
- As you were.
Lieutenant?
Val'eris, sir.
We were told you needed a helmsman, so I volunteered.
It is agreeable to see you again.
She was the first Vulcan to graduate at the top of her class at the Academy.
- You must be very proud.
- I don't believe so, sir.
She's a Vulcan, alright.
Let's get this over with.
Departure stations.
- Scotty?
Did you find the engine room?
- Right where I left it.
Stand by.
Uhura, get me the dock master.
Control tower reading, sir.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
This is Control.
Permission to depart granted. 30 seconds for port gates.
- Clear all moorings.
- Awaiting port gates from this mark.
- All lines clear.
- Aft thrusters.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
1 quarter impulse power.
Captain, regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock.
Jim...
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
Aye, sir.
Captain's log.
Stardate 9522.6.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I can never forgive them for the death of my boy.
To escort the Chancellor of the Klingon High Council to a peace summit is problematic, at best.
Spock says this could be an historic occasion.
I'd like to believe him.
But how on Earth can history get past people like me?
- Sorry.
- You could have knocked.
We are almost at the rendezvous, sir.
I thought that you would like to know.
Permission to speak freely, sir.
It is an honour to serve with you.
You piloted well out of space dock, Lieutenant.
I've always wanted to try that.
You've done well, Val'eris.
As your sponsor at the Academy I've followed your career with satisfaction.
And as a Vulcan, you have exceeded my expectations.
I do not understand this representation.
It's a depiction from ancient Earth mythology.
"The expulsion from Paradise."
- Why keep it in your quarters?
- To remind me that all things end.
It is of endings that I wish to speak.
Sir, I address you as a kindred intellect.
Do you not recognise that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
History is replete with turning points.
You must have faith.
- Faith?
- The universe will unfold as it should.
- Is that logical?
Surely we must...
- Logic, logic, logic.
Logic is the beginning of wisdom, Val'eris.
Not the end.
This will be my final voyage on board this vessel as a member of her crew.
Nature abhors a vacuum.
I intend you to replace me.
I could only succeed you, sir.
Now hear this.
All offiicers to the bridge.
Klingon battle cruiser off the port bow.
All Officers to the bridge.
Captain on the bridge!
Shall we raise our shields, Captain?
I've never been this close.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
- Uhura, hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Right standard rudder.
Bring us alongside.
Right standard rudder.
Z plus 5 degrees.
Channel is open, Captain.
This is the Starship Enterprise.
Captain James T. Kirk commanding.
This is Kronos One.
I am Chancellor Gorkon.
We've been ordered to escort you to your meeting on Earth.
Thank you.
Would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard the Enterprise as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We would be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 19:30 hours.
I shall look forward to that.
I hope you're happy.
Captain!
There is a supply of Romulan ale aboard.
It might make the evening pass more... smoothly.
Officer thinking, Lieutenant.
Guess who's coming to dinner.
Energize.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- Captain Kirk.
May I present Captain Spock, whom I believe you know.
Captain, face to face at last.
You have my thanks.
Chancellor.
Gentlemen.
This is my daughter, Azetbur...
My military advisor, Brigadier Kerla...
General Chang, my chief of staff.
I have so wanted to meet you, Captain.
- I'm not sure how to take that.
- Sincere admiration, Kirk.
From one warrior to another.
Right...
This way.
You might enjoy a brief tour.
- They all look alike.
- What about that smell?
You know only top of the line models can even talk...
- You men have work?
- Yes, ma'am.
Then snap to it.
I offer a toast.
The undiscovered country.
- The future.
- The undiscovered country.
Hamlet, act 3, scene 1 .
You have not experienced Shake- speare until you've read him in Klingon.
Captain Kirk.
I thought Romulan ale was illegal.
An advantage of being 1,000 light years from Federation headquarters.
To you, Chancellor Gorkon.
One of the architects of our future.
Chancellor!
Perhaps we are looking at something of that future here.
Tell me, Captain Kirk.
Would you be willing to give up Starfleet?
The Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace.
I wouldn't dispute my first officer.
Starfleet has always been...
There's no need to mince words.
In space, all warriors are cold warriors.
General, are you fond of...
Shakespeare?
We believe all planets have a sovereign claim to inalienable human rights.
"Inalien..." If you could only hear yourselves.
"Human rights." Why, the very name is racist.
The Federation is a "homo sapiens only" club.
Present company excepted, of course.
We know where this is leading - the annihilation of our culture.
That's not true.
No!
"To be or not to be"...
That is the question which preoccupies our people.
- We need breathing room.
- Earth.
Hitler, 1938.
I beg your pardon.
Well...
I see we have a long way to go.
We must do this again sometime.
You don't trust me, do you?
I don't blame you.
If there is to be a brave new world, our generation is going to have the hardest time living in it.
- Captain Spock.
- Chancellor.
Madam.
Captain.
Well, most kind.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
Hmm, Captain?
"Have we not heard the chimes at midnight?"
Thank God!
- Did you see the way they ate?
- Terrible table manners.
I doubt our own behaviour will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy.
I'm going to sleep this off.
Is there any other way we can screw up tonight?
I'm going to go find a pot of black coffee.
The Enterprise hosted Chancellor Gorkon to dinner last night.
Our manners weren't exactly Emily Post.
To the galley
- Romulan ale no longer to be served at diplomatic functions.
Captain Kirk, will you please join me on the bridge?
Captain Kirk?
- Captain.
- What is it?
- I find this curious.
- Spock, I'm really tired.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
- Where?
- It appears to emanate from us.
The Enterprise?
Val'eris, do you know anything about a radiation surge?
Chekov?
Only the size of my head.
I know what you mean.
- What's happened?
- We've fired on the Chancellor's ship.
Torpedo room!
Please confirm, have we fired?
- Uhura, monitor.
- Aye, sir.
- Direct hit.
- Confirmed, sir.
We've lost gravity!
We are betrayed!
This is the bridge.
Do you read me?
- Did we fire those torpedoes?
- Negative.
We're still fully loaded.
Find Chang.
Unable to confirm or deny firing the torpedoes.
- Hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Kronos One, this is Enterprise.
Do you read?
It's very hard to make out.
There's been weapons firing and a lot of shouting.
- She's still listing.
- She's spinning out of control.
Restoring auxiliary gravity...
Have you not a shred of decency in you, Kirk?
We come in peace, and you blatantly defy that peace.
For that, I shall blow you out of the stars.
- We haven't fired.
- Captain...
According to our data banks, we have.
Twice...
Captain, they're coming about.
- They're preparing to fire.
- Shields up, Captain?
- Captain, our shields.
- Shields up, Captain?
Signal our surrender.
We surrender!
- This is Enterprise.
We surrender.
- If they fire, with our shields down...
- ...we will not be able to respond.
- Repeat, Enterprise surrenders.
- Are we firing torpedoes?
- I wish I knew.
- I'm going aboard.
Spock, take the con.
- I involved you, I will go.
No, I'll go.
We'll not be the instigators of war on the eve of universal peace.
I'm going too, they may need a doctor.
Uhura, tell them we're coming, and tell them we're unarmed.
- Have you lost your mind?
!
- I don't understand what's happened.
We're here to help.
Follow me.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- My God!
What has happened here?
- You dare to feign ignorance?
- What happened?
With a direct torpedo hit, you crippled our gravitational field and two of your Starfleet crew beamed aboard wearing magnetic boots.
- Aren't you carrying a surgeon?
- We were until this disgrace.
Then for god's sake, let me help.
I've got a pulse - we can move him.
I need light.
Put him on the table.
Hold him!
Hold him while I stabilize him.
I said hold him!
Sweet Jesus.
- Can you...?
- I don't even know his anatomy.
- His wounds are not closing.
- He's killing him!
He's gone into some kind of damned arrest.
Come on, dammit!
Come on!
He's not responding.
Don't let it end this way, Captain.
Under article 184 of your Interstellar Law I'm placing you under arrest.
You're charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
He tried to save him.
They've been arrested.
Mr Spock, we've got to do something.
I assume command of this ship as of 02:30 hours.
Commander Uhura, notify Starfleet headquarters and request instructions.
We cannot allow them to be taken to Kronos as prisoners.
Opening fire will not retrieve them, and we must avoid an armed conflict.
We will be able to follow the Captain's movements.
- How did you achieve this?
- Time is precious.
We must piece together what happened here tonight.
According to our data bank, this ship fired those torpedoes.
- No way!
- I sympathize, but we need evidence.
Please accompany me.
And if we cannot piece together what happened?
What then, sir?
In that case, Mr Chekov, it resides in the purview of the diplomats.
The Chancellor of the High Council is dead!
The result of an unprovoked attack while he travelled to see you under a flag of truce on a mission of peace!
Captain Kirk was legally arrested for the crime.
He and Dr. McCoy boarded Kronos One of their own free will.
- None of these facts are in dispute.
- I have ordered an investigation.
- In the meantime...
- In the meantime we expect the Federation to abide by the articles of Interstellar Law.
Kirk and Dr. McCoy will stand trial for the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon.
Out of the question.
Ambassador Sarek, can we get them extradited?
I share a measure of personal responsibility in this matter, but I am obliged to confirm my esteemed colleagues legal interpretation.
What is the position of the Romulan government?
I must concur with my colleagues.
You can't believe that Kirk assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council.
Mr President.
I don't know what to believe.
I'm waiting for your answer, sir.
This President is not above the law.
Mr President, Starfleet command is here from San Francisco.
- Mr President.
- Mr President.
Bill, Admiral Cartwright, please sit down.
Mr President, we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
I'm constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
Sir, would you please take a look at this.
We prepared Operation Retrieve based on the danger of terrorism between the Klingon empire and the Federation.
We can go in, rescue the hostages and get out in 24 hours with acceptable losses.
- We have the technology...
- Yes, yes.
But suppose you precipitate a full-scale war?
Then, quite frankly, we can clean their chronometers.
Mr President, they are vulnerable.
There will never be a better time.
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be.
I'll bear that in mind.
Thank you, gentlemen, that's all for now.
Mr President.
Sir...
Those men have literally saved this planet.
And now they're going to save it again.
By standing trial.
Report back on the double.
Do you read?
- We're to report back at once.
- We can't abandon Kirk and McCoy.
400 years ago, on Earth, workers who felt their livelyhood threatened flung their wooden shoes called "sabots" into the machines to stop them.
Hence the word "sabotage".
We experience technical malfunction.
All back-up systems inoperative.
Excellent.
I mean... too bad.
Mr President, I have been named chancellorin my father's place.
Madam Chancellor, you have my condolences on your loss.
I assure you that this shameful deed will not...
Let us come to the point.
You want this conference to go forward.
I will attend in one week, on one condition.
We will not extradite the prisoners, and you will not attempt to rescue them.
We would consider any such attempt an act of war.
We hope you'll be our guest here on Earth.
After recent events, you will understand if I prefer a neutral site.
And in the interest of security, let us keep the location secret for now.
As you wish, Madam Chancellor.
Attack them now, while we still can.
Attack or be slaves in their world.
We can take whole by force, what they propose to divide.
War is obsolete, General.
As we are in danger of becoming.
Better to die on our feet than live on our knees.
That wasn't what my father wanted.
Your father was killed for what he wanted.
The peace process will go forward.
Kirk...
Kirk will pay for my father's death.
It is as I said, Mr Spock.
Inventory registers every torpedo.
Yet the data banks insist we fired.
- One computer is lying.
- A computer doesn't lie!
Precisely.
Therefore we must inspect each torpedo visually.
That could take hours!
And if they're all there?
Then someone forged an entry in the data banks.
Gorkon's daughter has been named Chancellor.
It was on the news.
I'll bet that bitch killed her father.
- Her own father?
- It is an old story, sir.
They don't place the same value on life as we do, you know that.
Take my word, she did not shed one bloody tear.
Hardly conclusive, since Klingons have no tear-ducts.
Lieutenant, any response from Starfleet since our dispatch?
Yes, sir.
And?
Commander Uhura is experiencing technical difficulties, sir.
Curious.
Very well.
For 24 hours, we will agree this conversation didn't take place.
- A lie?
- An omission.
In 24 hours we won't have a clue where Captain Kirk is.
- I know precisely where he will be.
- You do?
Where?
Kirk, Kirk, Kirk, Kirk...
It's a damn show trial.
The Enterprise fired on Kronos One without provocation.
The Chancellor and his advisors having been lulled into a false sense of security by an invitation to a dinner aboard Captain Kirk's vessel at precisely 19:30 hours that same evening.
Call your first witness.
After the first shot we lost our gravitational field.
I was weightless and couldn't function.
Then two Starfleet crewmen came towards me.
Or perhaps they merely wore Starfleet uniforms.
That remark is speculative.
I move that it be stricken.
We're interested in facts, not theories.
If the gravitational unit was not functioning, how could they walk?
They appeared to be wearing magnetic boots.
- Gravity boots...?
- Dr. McCoy.
Would you be so good as to tell me what is your current medical status?
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
You have a singular wit, Doctor.
For 27 years I've been surgeon aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.
In three months I stand down.
You know...
I believe that you consumed rather a generous amount of Romulan ale in the officers mess on the night in question.
- Objection.
- Sustained.
We all did.
All of us.
That doesn't mean...
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
Barely.
Now be careful, Doctor.
Have you ever in your past saved patients as barely alive as he?
I didn't have the medical knowledge I needed for Klingon anatomy.
- I see.
- You where there.
You say you are due for retirement.
May I ask, do your hands shake?
- Objection!
- I was nervous.
No.
You were incompetent.
You were incompetent!
Whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink.
- The court will have to determine.
- My God, man.
I tried to save him!
I tried to save him.
I was desperate to save him.
He was the last best hope in the Universe for peace.
The witness is excused.
There we have it, citizens.
We have established the particulars of the crime.
And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair.
James Tiberius Kirk.
What would your favourite author say, Captain?
"Let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings."
Tell us your sad story, Kirk.
Tell us that you planned to take revenge for the death of your son.
- That's not true.
- Objection!
Captain Kirk has not been identified as the assassin.
I offer into the record this excerpt from the Captain's personal log.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I've never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Again!
Again!
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I've never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Are those your words?
Those words were spoken by me.
Objection!
My client's political views are not on trial.
On the contrary.
Captain Kirk's views are at the very heart of the matter.
His record shows him to be an insubordinate, unprincipled opportunist with a history of violating the chain of command whenever it suited him.
Continue.
The record shows that Captain Kirk once held the rank of Admiral and he was broken for taking matters into his own hands.
Do you deny being demoted for these charges.
Answer me now!
- I cannot deny it.
- You were demoted?
- For insubordination?
- On occasion, I have disobeyed orders.
Were you obeying or disobeying orders when you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?
I didn't know about it until we boarded the ship.
You still deny the Enterprise fired on Kronos One?
And you still deny your men beamed aboard and shot the Chancellor?
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I didn't witness.
Are you aware that as the captain of a ship, you are responsible for the actions of your men?
I am.
If it's proved that members of your crew carried out the assassination...
- They're setting us up.
Your Honours!
- Do not answer.
Captain Kirk, you will answer the question.
As Captain I'm responsible for the crew under my command.
Your Honours, the state rests.
Send to Commander Enterprise.
"We stand ready to assist you.
Captain Sulu, U.S.S. Excelsior."
It is the determination of this court that the prisoners are guilty as charged.
I wish to note for the record that all the evidence is circumstantial.
I beg the court to consider this when pronouncing its sentence.
So noted.
Captain James T. Kirk, Dr. Leonard McCoy.
In the interest of fostering amity for the forthcoming peace talks, the sentence of death is commuted.
It is the judgement of this court that, without possibility of reprieve or parole, you be taken from this place to the dilithium mines on the penal asteroid of Rura Penthe.
There to spend the rest of your natural lives.
Rura Penthe!
Known throughout the galaxy as the alien's graveyard.
Better to kill them now and get it over with.
Lieutenant.
The torpedo hit once again, please.
Hold.
It is Enterprise.
We fired.
That is not possible!
All weapons visually accounted for, sir.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains must be the truth.
What does that mean?
That if we cannot have fired those torpedoes, someone else did.
They didn't fire on themselves and there are no other ships present.
- There was a neutron surge.
- Not from us.
A neutron surge that big could only be produced by another ship.
- Kronos One?
- Too far away.
Very near us.
Possibly beneath us.
If there were a ship beneath us, the Klingons would have seen it.
Would they?
- A Bird of Prey?
- A Bird of Prey.
- Cloaked?
- They can't fired when they're cloaked.
All things being equal, I would agree.
However, things are not equal.
This one can.
- We must inform Starfleet Command.
- Of what?
A new weapon that's invisible?
They'll call us raving lunatics.
They'll say we'll say anything to exonerate the Captain.
And they would be correct.
We have no evidence.
Only a theory which happens to fit the facts.
Assuming you're right.
Why would they fire on their own President?
Indeed.
This ship will be searched from bow to stern.
I do not understand.
If there was a ship underneath us surely the assassins beamed aboard from that vessel, not Enterprise.
You're forgetting something, Mr Chekov.
According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
If we did, the killers are here.
If we did not, whoever altered the data banks is here.
In either case, what we are looking for is here.
- What are we looking for, sir?
- Lieutenant.
Two pairs of gravity boots.
This is the gulag Rura Penthe.
This is the gulag Rura Penthe.
There is no stockades, no guard tower, no electronic frontier.
Only a magnetic shield prevents beaming.
Punishment means exile from prison to the surface.
On the surface, nothing can survive.
Work well, and you will be treated well.
Work badly, and you will die.
Oh, my God!
The universal translator has been confiscated.
I'm sorry...?
He's definitely on about something, Jim.
If this is your spot, we'll move on.
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
- He's got it.
- And your coat.
I'm afraid not.
It wouldn't fit.
- Thanks.
- This will help keep you warm.
- I'm Martia.
You're Kirk and McCoy.
- How did you know that?
We don't get many presidential assassins.
- We didn't kill Gorkon.
- Of course not.
- But there's a reward for your death.
- That figures.
We've been set up.
Somebody up there wants you out of the way.
- Any progress?
- None.
A crew of 300 are looking everywhere, but the killers may still be among them.
Surely they have disposed of these boots by now.
Would it not have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
Logic must give way to physics.
Gravity wasn't restored when they escaped.
Without the boots, they would have floated off the transporter pads.
Why not simply vaporize them?
Like this?
As you know, no one can fire an unauthorized phaser aboard a starship.
Suppose, when they returned, they threw the boots into the refuse.
I'm having the refuse searched.
If I'm correct, those boots will cling to the killer's necks like Tiberian bats.
They couldn't escape without them nor throw them out the window.
Those boots are here.
Somewhere.
- Did someone fire off a phaser?
- It's alright.
It's nothing.
Mr Spock, Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
- Who fired the...
- Ah, Mr Scott.
I hear you have difficulty with the warp drive.
How long do you need for repair?
There's nothing wrong with the bloody thing.
If we return to space dock, the killers can dispose of their footwear and we will never see the Captain or Dr. McCoy alive again.
- It could take weeks.
- Thank you.
Val'eris, inform Starfleet our warp drive is inoperative.
- A lie?
- An error.
We have lost all contact with the Captain and Dr. McCoy.
Yes, at the moment they're surrounded by a magnetic shield.
But if I know the Captain, he is deep into planning his escape.
You've got him where you want him, Jim!
- Are you alright?
- I think so.
- They'll respect you now.
- I was lucky that thing had knees.
That was not his knee.
Not everybody keep their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Anything you want to tell me?
See what you can do for him.
Let him know we're not holding a grudge.
Suppose he's holding a grudge?
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
- Do you want to get out of here?
- There's got to be a way.
Three months before retirement.
What a way to finish.
- We're not finished.
- Speak for yourself.
One day, one night...
Kobayashi Maru!
Bones!
Are you afraid of the future?
I believe that was the general idea that I was trying to convey.
- I don't mean this future.
- What is this - multiple choice?
Some people are afraid...
of what might happen.
- I was terrified.
- What terrified you, specifically?
No more neutral zone.
I was used to hating Klingons.
It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his words.
- Spock was right.
- We all felt exactly the same.
No.
Somebody felt a lot worse.
I'm beginning to understand why.
If you've got any bright ideas, now is the time.
Time is the problem.
You and I are nothing.
You heard the judge - the peace conference is on again.
Whoever killed Gorkon is bound to attempt another assassination.
Unless we can get out of here.
It's me
- Martia.
Listen.
No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
- Except us.
- It is possible.
I know how to get outside the shield.
- How do we fit in?
- Getting outside the shield is easy.
After that, you have to get us off the surface before we freeze.
Can you?
- It's possible.
- I can't make it alone.
You're the likeliest candidate to come here for months.
Candidate for what?
Go to lift 7 in the morning for mining duty.
I'll see you there.
Don't disappoint me.
- What is it with you, anyway?
- Still think we're finished?
More than ever.
Sorry to wake you, sir.
Starfleet requests any data we have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
What?
They're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to space dock, sir.
Signal Starfleet that we have no idea location Enterprise.
- Sir?
- You have hearing problems?
No, sir.
Klingon blood.
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
This is the first evidence which corroborates our theory.
Now we go to Starfleet?
We expand our search to include uniforms.
All uniforms?
Clear, sir.
Make a hole.
Coming through.
Coming through.
Sir!
Sir!
- I think we've been had.
- No, you weren't, Doctor.
Get off at the first level.
Follow the gang into the mine.
They don't take girls.
- You are crewman Dax?
- Yes.
What is the problem?
Perhaps you know Russian epic of Cinderella?
If shoe fits - wear it.
Mr Chekov...
Watch me.
What kind of creature is this?
Last night you two were...
Get in.
Come on.
We don't have a lot of time.
Hurry!
Up there.
Come on - climb!
Here, you'll need these.
Quickly!
Stay close.
- There they are.
- They emerge from the beaming shield.
Mr Scott, start your engines.
Mr Chekov, set course for Rura Penthe.
Mr Spock, Rura Penthe is deep inside the Klingon frontier.
- If we're discovered...
- Correct.
We need a feat of linguistic legerdemain and intrepidity before the Captain and Dr. McCoy freeze to death.
- Leave me, I'm finished.
- No!
Bones, I'm wearing a viridium patch on my back.
Spock slapped it there before we went on Gorkon's ship.
That cunning little Vulcan.
Come on!
We're in the clear.
Now that we're outside the shield, they can locate us two sectors away.
If they're even looking for us.
This is listening post Morska.
What ship is that, over?
We must respond.
A universal translator would be recognised.
We am thy freighter...
Ursva.
Six weeks out of Kronos.
"What is your destination, over? "
We is condemning food things and supplies.
Don't catch any bugs.
Would you mind explaining that little trick you do?
- I'm a Chameloid.
- I've heard about you.
Shape-shifters.
I thought you were mythical.
Give a girl a chance, Captain.
It takes a lot of effort.
I don't doubt it.
Stop me if I'm wrong, but do we have any way of knowing whether this is the real you?
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.
We're outside the shield.
Now it's your turn, Captain.
If you say so.
Are you crazy?
!
She didn't need our help.
Where did you get these convenient clothes?
Don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue.
It's to let them know where we are.
Ask her what she's getting in return.
A full pardon... which doesn't cover this.
An accident wasn't good enough.
Come on, Spock.
Good enough for one.
Two would have looked suspicious.
Killed while attempting escape.
That's convincing for both.
Surprise!
- Your friends are late.
- They'll be along.
- I can't believe I kissed you.
- Must have been your lifelong ambition.
Isn't it time you became something else?
I like it here.
Well, well, well...
What took you so long?
Kill him, he's the one.
Not me, you idiot - him!
- No witnesses.
- Killed while trying to escape.
- Damned clever, if you ask me.
- It's a classic.
- That's what he wanted.
- Who?
Who wanted us killed?
Since you're all going to die anyway, why not tell you?
His name is...
Damn it!
What the hell!
Son of a...!
Couldn't you have waited two seconds?
He was about to explain the whole thing.
- You want to go back?
- Absolutely not!
This is the bridge.
We're still in Klingon space.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
They were beamed aboard a Federation Starship.
I could trace...
Escaped.
Kirk cannot know the location of the peace conference.
Are you sure?
Will you take that chance?
Helmsman, make course to intercept Enterprise.
The Klingons have a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked.
- She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
- So that's it.
We believe that Gorkon's murderers are aboard this ship.
- Has the peace conference begun?
- Who knows?
The location is secret.
- There's always something.
- Captain!
Mr Spock!
I found the uniforms with the Klingon blood on them.
But the uniforms belong to these two men.
Burke and Samno.
Not anymore.
Phaser on "stun" at close range.
First rule of assassination - kill the assassins.
- Now we're back to square one.
- Can I talk to you?
- Why weren't they vaporized?
- It would set off the alarm.
It's possible.
Now hear this.
Now hear this.
Court reporter to sick bay.
Code blue - urgent.
Statements to be taken at once from Yeomen Burke and Samno.
Repeat, court reporter to sick bay.
Code blue - urgent.
Statements to be taken.
Repeat, statements to be taken from Yeomen Burke and Samno.
You have to shoot.
If you are logical, you have to shoot.
- I do not want to.
- What you want is irrelevant.
What you've chosen is at hand.
I'd just as soon you didn't.
The operation is over.
I did not fire.
You cannot prove anything.
Yes, I can.
At my trial my personal log was used against me.
How long did you wait outside my quarters before I noticed you?
You knew?
I tried to tell you, but you would not listen.
Neither of us was hearing very well that night.
There were things I tried to tell you, about having faith.
You have betrayed the Federation.
All of you.
- And what have you've been doing?
- Saving Starfleet.
Klingons cannot be trusted.
Sir...
You said so yourself.
They killed your son.
Did you not wish Gorkon dead?
"Let them die", you said.
Did I misinterpret you?
And you were right.
They conspired with us to assassinate their own Chancellor.
How trustworthy can they be?
Klingons and Federation members conspiring together.
- Who is "us"?
- All who stands to lose from peace.
Names, Lieutenant.
My comrades will make certain all your transmissions are jammed.
- Names, Lieutenant!
- I do not remember.
A lie?
A choice.
Spock.
Admiral Cartwright.
From Starfleet?
Who else?
General...
Chang.
- Who else?
- Romulan Ambassador and others.
Where is the peace conference?
Where is the peace conference?
She does not know.
Then we're dead.
I have been dead before.
Contact Excelsior.
- She'll have the co-ordinates.
- I've already got it, sir.
- Standing by, Captain Kirk.
- Sulu.
You realize that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations.
I'm sorry, Captain.
Yourmessage is breaking up.
Bless you, Sulu.
Where is the peace conference?
They'll attempt another assassination.
It's at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border.
I'm sending the co-ordinates on a coded frequency.
We'll need more than that.
There's a Bird of Prey on the look-out for us that can fire when cloaked.
Surely not.
How many of those things are there?
Come on, Lieutenant.
- Just the prototype.
- Do you hear that?
I'm getting under way now.
We're in Alpha Quadrant.
The chances of our reaching the conference in time are slim.
- When does this conference start?
- According to my information - today.
- Thank you, Captain Sulu.
- Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
Spock?
I prefer it dark.
- Dining on ashes?
- You were right.
It was arrogant presumption on my part that got us into this situation.
You and the Doctor might have been killed.
The night is young.
You said it yourself, it was logical.
Peace is worth a few personal risks.
You're a great one for logic.
I'm a great one for rushing in where angels fear to tread.
We're both extremists.
Reality is probably somewhere in between.
I couldn't get past the death of my son.
I was prejudiced by her accomplishments as a Vulcan.
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was.
Is it possible that we two, you and I, have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?
Would that constitute a joke?
- It wasn't your fault.
- I was responsible.
- For no actions but your own.
- That's not what you said at your trial.
That was as captain of the ship.
Human beings...
We both know that I am not human.
Do you want to know something?
Everybody's human.
I find that remark... insulting.
Come, I need you.
Madam Chancellor, members of the diplomatic corps honoured guests.
The United Federation of Planets welcomes you to Camp Khitomer.
She's out here somewhere.
- But if she's cloaked...
- Then all we have is a radiation surge.
By the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes.
2.06... 2.03...
- Close enough to beam down?
- Not yet.
In two minutes. 1.58.
Go to impulse power for Khitomer.
Let us redefine progress to mean that just because we can do a thing it does not necessarily follow that we must do that thing.
- Uhura?
- Nothing, Captain.
If she's here, she's rigged for silent running.
Coming up on transporter range in 57 seconds.
Transporter room.
Stand by to beam down.
53... 48 seconds.
44...
I can see you, Kirk.
Chang.
Can you see me?
Now be honest, Captain.
Warrior to warrior.
You do prefer it this way, don't you?
As it was meant to be.
No peace in our time.
"Once more unto the breach, dearfriends. "
- This is fun.
- Reverse engines.
All astern.
One and a half impulse power.
Back off!
What's she doing?
What's she waiting for?
Probably attempting to ascertain why we are reversing.
Wondering whether we detect her.
Incoming!
- In range?
- Not yet, sir.
Come on!
- She'll fly apart.
- Fly her apart, then!
Many speculated about my father's motives.
Some said he was an idealist.
Others said he had no choice.
If Praxis had not exploded, his idealism wouldn't have found expression.
We are a proud race.
We are here because we intend to go on being proud.
- Go to auxiliary power!
- Auxiliary circuits destroyed.
"Tickle us, do we not laugh?
Prick us, do we not bleed?"
"Wrong us, shall we not revenge?"
Gas.
Gas, Captain.
Under impulse power she expands fuel, like all vessels.
We call it "plasma", but it is merely ionised gas.
What about our equipment to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
The thing's got to have a tail-pipe.
Doctor, would you assist me in performing surgery on a torpedo?
Fascinating.
Hard to starboard.
The proposed agenda is as follows:
The evacuation of Kronos has been calculated within the 50 Earth year time span.
Phase 1- preparation for evacuation...
Captain, she's packing quite a wallop.
Shields weakening.
Shields up!
Alright, now we're giving them something else to shoot at.
The game's afoot.
- Excelsior's been hit!
- "Our revels now are ended", Kirk.
"Cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war. "
- Bones, where's my torpedo?
- Bet you wished you'd stayed in bed.
Shields collapsing!
The key, please.
Time is short.
- The hull has been compromised.
- I wonder how bad.
Connect echo-bars.
...discuss the report on phase 2.
- Alter circuit A.
- Sensor.
...we commence within minutes of the preparation.
- "I am constant as the Northern star. "
- I'd give real money, if he'd shut up.
Plate, please.
...and assimilation will consume...
We've got a heart beat.
...with the Klingon Empire...
Key, please.
- Where's that torpedo?
- She's ready.
Lock and load!
Fire!
"To be... or not" "to be. "
Target that explosion and fire.
Fire!
This work will occupy us throughout most of the week.
I hope that the delegation can implement the provisions of Phase 1 by the first of next month.
As you know, time is of the essence.
Out of the way!
Mr President!
Mr President!
Kirk, Enterprise.
Protect the Chancellor!
- Arrest those men!
- Arrest yourself!
We've got a full confession.
- This is not Klingon blood.
- Cartwright.
Just a minute.
It's Colonel West!
What's happened?
What's the mean of all of this?
It's about the future, Madam Chancellor.
Some people think the future means the end of history.
We haven't run out of history quite yet.
Your father called the future "the undiscovered country".
People can be very frightened of change.
You've restored my father's faith.
And you've restored my son's.
Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
And they're not going to prosecute.
They could have prosecuted me.
I felt like Val'eris.
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
And it's a good thing, too.
If they did, we'd all have to turn ourselves in.
- Captain Kirk.
- Captain Sulu.
As much to the crew of the Enterprise, I owe you my thanks.
Nice to see you in action one more time, Captain Kirk.
Take care.
- My God, that's a big ship.
- Not so big as her captain.
So...
This is goodbye?
It's about time we got underway ourselves.
Captain, I have orders from Starfleet Command.
We're to put back to space dock immediately... to be decommissioned.
If I were human, I believe my response would be:
"Go to hell. "
If I were human.
Course heading, Captain?
Second star to the right.
And straight on 'til morning.
Captain's log, stardate 9529. 1.
This is the final cruise of the Starship Enterprise under my command.
This ship, and her history will shortly become the care of another crew.
To them and their posterity will we commit our future.
They'll continue the voyages we have begun and journey to all the undiscovered countries boldly going where no man, where no one has gone before.
We are betrayed!
Find Chang.
Restoring auxiliary gravity...
Attack them now, while we still can.
Attack or be slaves in their world.
We can take whole by force, what they propose to divide.
War is obsolete, General.
As we are in danger of becoming.
Better to die on our feet than live on our knees.
That wasn't what my father wanted.
Again!
Again!
This is listening post Morska.

Captain's log U.S.S. Excelsior.
Hikaru Sulu commanding.
After three years I've concluded my first assignment as master of this vessel cataloguing gaseous planetary anomalies in Beta Quadrant.
We're heading home under full impulse power.
I'm pleased to report that ship and crew have functioned well.
According to this, we've completed our survey of the entire sector.
I have an energy wave at 240 degrees mark six port.
Visual!
My...
God!
Shields.
Shields!
She's not answering her helm.
Starboard thrusters.
Turn her into the wave.
Go to impulse power.
- Damage report.
- Checking all systems.
- That was no meteor shower.
- Negative, sir.
The sub-space shock-wave originated at bearing 323.75.
Location...
It's Praxis, sir.
It's a Klingon moon.
Praxis is their key energy production facility.
Send to Klingon High Command. "This is Excelsior, a Federation Starship."
"We have monitored a large explosion in your sector."
- "Do you require assistance?"
- Aye, sir.
- Mr Vultane, any more data?
- I've confirmed Praxis' location, but...
- I cannot confirm Praxis' existence.
- On screen.
- Magnify.
- Computer enhancement.
- Praxis?
- What's left of it, sir.
Captain, I'm getting a message from Praxis.
Let's have it.
This is Brigadier Kerla, speaking for the High Command.
There has been an incident on Praxis.
However, everything is under control.
We have no need for assistance.
Obey treaty stipulations and remain outside the Neutral Zone.
This transmission ends now.
- An incident?
- Do we report this, sir?
Are you kidding?
- What are we doing here?
- Maybe it's a retirement party.
That suits me.
I just bought a boat.
I'm supposed to be chairing a seminar at the Academy.
- Isn't this just for top brass?
- Where is Sulu?
Captain Sulu?
On assignment.
Where's Spock?
This briefing is classified.
Ladies and gentlemen, the C-in-C.
As you were.
I'll break this information down succinctly.
The Klingon empire has 50 years of life left.
For full details, I'm turning this briefing over to Federation Special Envoy.
Good morning.
Two months ago a Federation Starship monitored an explosion on Praxis.
We believe it was caused by over-mining and insufficient safety precautions.
The moon's decimation means deadly pollution of their ozone.
They will have depleted their oxygen supply in 50 Earth years.
Due to their enormous military budget the Klingon economy doesn't have the resources to combat this catastrophe.
Last month, at the behest of the Vulcan Ambassador, -
- I opened a dialogue with Gorkon, Chancellor of the Klingon High Council.
He proposes to commence negotiations at once.
Negotiations for what?
The dismantling of our space stations and bases along the Neutral Zone, an end to 70 years of hostility, which the Klingons can no longer afford.
Bill, are we talking about mothballing the Starfleet?
Our exploration and scientific programs would be unaffected, but...
I must protest!
To offer Klingons safe haven within Federation space is suicide.
Klingons would become the alien trash of the galaxy.
If we dismantle the fleet, we'd be defenceless before an aggressive species on our territory.
The opportunity here is to bring them to their knees.
Then we'll be in a better position to dictate terms.
- Sir...
- Captain Kirk?
The Klingons have never been trustworthy.
I agree with Admiral Cartwright.
This is a terrifying idea.
It is imperative that we act now to support the Gorkon initiative, lest more conservative elements persuade his empire that it's better to attempt a military solution and die fighting.
You, Captain Kirk, are to be our first olive branch.
We are to rendezvous with the vessel which is bringing Gorkon to Earth and to escort him safely through Federation space.
Me?
There are Klingons who feel the same about the peace treaty as yourself, but they'll think twice about attacking the Enterprise under your command.
I have personally vouched for you in this matter.
You have personally vouched...?
You will extend Chancellor Gorkon full diplomatic courtesy, Captain.
- A full Ambassador is better equipped...
- If there's no further business I wish you and your crew Godspeed.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
I remind you this meeting is classified.
I don't know whether to congratulate you or not, Jim.
I wouldn't.
We volunteered?
There's an old Vulcan proverb.
"Only Nixon could go to China."
How could you vouch for me?
- That's arrogant presumption.
- My father requested that I open...
I know your father is the Vulcan Ambassador, but you know how I feel.
- They're animals.
- Jim...
- There is an historic opportunity here.
- Don't believe them!
Don't trust them.
- They're dying.
- Let them die.
Has it occurred to you that this crew is due to stand down in three months?
We've done our bit for king and country.
You should have trusted me.
Control, this is S-D 103, approach to Space dock.
Over.
You are clear to deliver Captain Kirk and party to N.C.C. 1701 Alpha.
- Captain on the bridge!
- As you were.
Lieutenant?
Val'eris, sir.
We were told you needed a helmsman, so I volunteered.
It is agreeable to see you again.
She was the first Vulcan to graduate at the top of her class at the Academy.
- You must be very proud.
- I don't believe so, sir.
She's a Vulcan, alright.
Let's get this over with.
Departure stations.
- Scotty?
Did you find the engine room?
- Right where I left it.
Stand by.
Uhura, get me the dock master.
Control tower reading, sir.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
This is Control.
Permission to depart granted. 30 seconds for port gates.
- Clear all moorings.
- Awaiting port gates from this mark.
- All lines clear.
- Aft thrusters.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
1 quarter impulse power.
Captain, regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock.
Jim...
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
Aye, sir.
Captain's log.
Stardate 9522.6.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I can never forgive them for the death of my boy.
To escort the Chancellor of the Klingon High Council to a peace summit is problematic, at best.
Spock says this could be an historic occasion.
I'd like to believe him.
But how on Earth can history get past people like me?
- Sorry.
- You could have knocked.
We are almost at the rendezvous, sir.
I thought that you would like to know.
Permission to speak freely, sir.
It is an honour to serve with you.
You piloted well out of space dock, Lieutenant.
I've always wanted to try that.
You've done well, Val'eris.
As your sponsor at the Academy I've followed your career with satisfaction.
And as a Vulcan, you have exceeded my expectations.
I do not understand this representation.
It's a depiction from ancient Earth mythology.
"The expulsion from Paradise."
- Why keep it in your quarters?
- To remind me that all things end.
It is of endings that I wish to speak.
Sir, I address you as a kindred intellect.
Do you not recognise that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
History is replete with turning points.
You must have faith.
- Faith?
- The universe will unfold as it should.
- Is that logical?
Surely we must...
- Logic, logic, logic.
Logic is the beginning of wisdom, Val'eris.
Not the end.
This will be my final voyage on board this vessel as a member of her crew.
Nature abhors a vacuum.
I intend you to replace me.
I could only succeed you, sir.
Now hear this.
All offiicers to the bridge.
Klingon battle cruiser off the port bow.
All Officers to the bridge.
Captain on the bridge!
Shall we raise our shields, Captain?
I've never been this close.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
- Uhura, hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Right standard rudder.
Bring us alongside.
Right standard rudder.
Z plus 5 degrees.
Channel is open, Captain.
This is the Starship Enterprise.
Captain James T. Kirk commanding.
This is Kronos One.
I am Chancellor Gorkon.
We've been ordered to escort you to your meeting on Earth.
Thank you.
Would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard the Enterprise as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We would be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 19:30 hours.
I shall look forward to that.
I hope you're happy.
Captain!
There is a supply of Romulan ale aboard.
It might make the evening pass more... smoothly.
Officer thinking, Lieutenant.
Guess who's coming to dinner.
Energize.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- Captain Kirk.
May I present Captain Spock, whom I believe you know.
Captain, face to face at last.
You have my thanks.
Chancellor.
Gentlemen.
This is my daughter, Azetbur...
My military advisor, Brigadier Kerla...
General Chang, my chief of staff.
I have so wanted to meet you, Captain.
- I'm not sure how to take that.
- Sincere admiration, Kirk.
From one warrior to another.
Right...
This way.
You might enjoy a brief tour.
- They all look alike.
- What about that smell?
You know only top of the line models can even talk...
- You men have work?
- Yes, ma'am.
Then snap to it.
I offer a toast.
The undiscovered country.
- The future.
- The undiscovered country.
Hamlet, act 3, scene 1 .
You have not experienced Shake- speare until you've read him in Klingon.
Captain Kirk.
I thought Romulan ale was illegal.
An advantage of being 1,000 light years from Federation headquarters.
To you, Chancellor Gorkon.
One of the architects of our future.
Chancellor!
Perhaps we are looking at something of that future here.
Tell me, Captain Kirk.
Would you be willing to give up Starfleet?
The Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace.
I wouldn't dispute my first officer.
Starfleet has always been...
There's no need to mince words.
In space, all warriors are cold warriors.
General, are you fond of...
Shakespeare?
We believe all planets have a sovereign claim to inalienable human rights.
"Inalien..." If you could only hear yourselves.
"Human rights." Why, the very name is racist.
The Federation is a "homo sapiens only" club.
Present company excepted, of course.
We know where this is leading - the annihilation of our culture.
That's not true.
No!
"To be or not to be"...
That is the question which preoccupies our people.
- We need breathing room.
- Earth.
Hitler, 1938.
I beg your pardon.
Well...
I see we have a long way to go.
We must do this again sometime.
You don't trust me, do you?
I don't blame you.
If there is to be a brave new world, our generation is going to have the hardest time living in it.
- Captain Spock.
- Chancellor.
Madam.
Captain.
Well, most kind.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
Hmm, Captain?
"Have we not heard the chimes at midnight?"
Thank God!
- Did you see the way they ate?
- Terrible table manners.
I doubt our own behaviour will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy.
I'm going to sleep this off.
Is there any other way we can screw up tonight?
I'm going to go find a pot of black coffee.
The Enterprise hosted Chancellor Gorkon to dinner last night.
Our manners weren't exactly Emily Post.
To the galley
- Romulan ale no longer to be served at diplomatic functions.
Captain Kirk, will you please join me on the bridge?
Captain Kirk?
- Captain.
- What is it?
- I find this curious.
- Spock, I'm really tired.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
- Where?
- It appears to emanate from us.
The Enterprise?
Val'eris, do you know anything about a radiation surge?
Chekov?
Only the size of my head.
I know what you mean.
- What's happened?
- We've fired on the Chancellor's ship.
Torpedo room!
Please confirm, have we fired?
- Uhura, monitor.
- Aye, sir.
- Direct hit.
- Confirmed, sir.
We've lost gravity!
We are betrayed!
This is the bridge.
Do you read me?
- Did we fire those torpedoes?
- Negative.
We're still fully loaded.
Find Chang.
Unable to confirm or deny firing the torpedoes.
- Hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Kronos One, this is Enterprise.
Do you read?
It's very hard to make out.
There's been weapons firing and a lot of shouting.
- She's still listing.
- She's spinning out of control.
Restoring auxiliary gravity...
Have you not a shred of decency in you, Kirk?
We come in peace, and you blatantly defy that peace.
For that, I shall blow you out of the stars.
- We haven't fired.
- Captain...
According to our data banks, we have.
Twice...
Captain, they're coming about.
- They're preparing to fire.
- Shields up, Captain?
- Captain, our shields.
- Shields up, Captain?
Signal our surrender.
We surrender!
- This is Enterprise.
We surrender.
- If they fire, with our shields down...
- ...we will not be able to respond.
- Repeat, Enterprise surrenders.
- Are we firing torpedoes?
- I wish I knew.
- I'm going aboard.
Spock, take the con.
- I involved you, I will go.
No, I'll go.
We'll not be the instigators of war on the eve of universal peace.
I'm going too, they may need a doctor.
Uhura, tell them we're coming, and tell them we're unarmed.
- Have you lost your mind?
!
- I don't understand what's happened.
We're here to help.
Follow me.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- My God!
What has happened here?
- You dare to feign ignorance?
- What happened?
With a direct torpedo hit, you crippled our gravitational field and two of your Starfleet crew beamed aboard wearing magnetic boots.
- Aren't you carrying a surgeon?
- We were until this disgrace.
Then for god's sake, let me help.
I've got a pulse - we can move him.
I need light.
Put him on the table.
Hold him!
Hold him while I stabilize him.
I said hold him!
Sweet Jesus.
- Can you...?
- I don't even know his anatomy.
- His wounds are not closing.
- He's killing him!
He's gone into some kind of damned arrest.
Come on, dammit!
Come on!
He's not responding.
Don't let it end this way, Captain.
Under article 184 of your Interstellar Law I'm placing you under arrest.
You're charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
He tried to save him.
They've been arrested.
Mr Spock, we've got to do something.
I assume command of this ship as of 02:30 hours.
Commander Uhura, notify Starfleet headquarters and request instructions.
We cannot allow them to be taken to Kronos as prisoners.
Opening fire will not retrieve them, and we must avoid an armed conflict.
We will be able to follow the Captain's movements.
- How did you achieve this?
- Time is precious.
We must piece together what happened here tonight.
According to our data bank, this ship fired those torpedoes.
- No way!
- I sympathize, but we need evidence.
Please accompany me.
And if we cannot piece together what happened?
What then, sir?
In that case, Mr Chekov, it resides in the purview of the diplomats.
The Chancellor of the High Council is dead!
The result of an unprovoked attack while he travelled to see you under a flag of truce on a mission of peace!
Captain Kirk was legally arrested for the crime.
He and Dr. McCoy boarded Kronos One of their own free will.
- None of these facts are in dispute.
- I have ordered an investigation.
- In the meantime...
- In the meantime we expect the Federation to abide by the articles of Interstellar Law.
Kirk and Dr. McCoy will stand trial for the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon.
Out of the question.
Ambassador Sarek, can we get them extradited?
I share a measure of personal responsibility in this matter, but I am obliged to confirm my esteemed colleagues legal interpretation.
What is the position of the Romulan government?
I must concur with my colleagues.
You can't believe that Kirk assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council.
Mr President.
I don't know what to believe.
I'm waiting for your answer, sir.
This President is not above the law.
Report back on the double.
Do you read?
- We're to report back at once.
- We can't abandon Kirk and McCoy.
400 years ago, on Earth, workers who felt their livelyhood threatened flung their wooden shoes called "sabots" into the machines to stop them.
Hence the word "sabotage".
We experience technical malfunction.
All back-up systems inoperative.
Excellent.
I mean... too bad.
Mr President, I have been named chancellorin my father's place.
Madam Chancellor, you have my condolences on your loss.
I assure you that this shameful deed will not...
Let us come to the point.
You want this conference to go forward.
I will attend in one week, on one condition.
We will not extradite the prisoners, and you will not attempt to rescue them.
We would consider any such attempt an act of war.
We hope you'll be our guest here on Earth.
After recent events, you will understand if I prefer a neutral site.
And in the interest of security, let us keep the location secret for now.
As you wish, Madam Chancellor.
Attack them now, while we still can.
Attack or be slaves in their world.
We can take whole by force, what they propose to divide.
War is obsolete, General.
As we are in danger of becoming.
Better to die on our feet than live on our knees.
That wasn't what my father wanted.
Your father was killed for what he wanted.
The peace process will go forward.
Kirk...
Kirk will pay for my father's death.
Kirk, Kirk, Kirk, Kirk...
It's a damn show trial.
The Enterprise fired on Kronos One without provocation.
The Chancellor and his advisors having been lulled into a false sense of security by an invitation to a dinner aboard Captain Kirk's vessel at precisely 19:30 hours that same evening.
Call your first witness.
After the first shot we lost our gravitational field.
I was weightless and couldn't function.
Then two Starfleet crewmen came towards me.
Or perhaps they merely wore Starfleet uniforms.
That remark is speculative.
I move that it be stricken.
We're interested in facts, not theories.
If the gravitational unit was not functioning, how could they walk?
They appeared to be wearing magnetic boots.
- Gravity boots...?
- Dr. McCoy.
Would you be so good as to tell me what is your current medical status?
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
You have a singular wit, Doctor.
For 27 years I've been surgeon aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.
In three months I stand down.
You know...
I believe that you consumed rather a generous amount of Romulan ale in the officers mess on the night in question.
- Objection.
- Sustained.
We all did.
All of us.
That doesn't mean...
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
Barely.
Now be careful, Doctor.
Have you ever in your past saved patients as barely alive as he?
I didn't have the medical knowledge I needed for Klingon anatomy.
- I see.
- You where there.
You say you are due for retirement.
May I ask, do your hands shake?
- Objection!
- I was nervous.
No.
You were incompetent.
You were incompetent!
Whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink.
- The court will have to determine.
- My God, man.
I tried to save him!
I tried to save him.
I was desperate to save him.
He was the last best hope in the Universe for peace.
The witness is excused.
There we have it, citizens.
We have established the particulars of the crime.
And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair.
James Tiberius Kirk.
What would your favourite author say, Captain?
"Let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings."
Tell us your sad story, Kirk.
Tell us that you planned to take revenge for the death of your son.
- That's not true.
- Objection!
Captain Kirk has not been identified as the assassin.
I offer into the record this excerpt from the Captain's personal log.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I've never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Again!
Again!
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I've never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Are those your words?
Those words were spoken by me.
Objection!
My client's political views are not on trial.
On the contrary.
Captain Kirk's views are at the very heart of the matter.
His record shows him to be an insubordinate, unprincipled opportunist with a history of violating the chain of command whenever it suited him.
Continue.
The record shows that Captain Kirk once held the rank of Admiral and he was broken for taking matters into his own hands.
Do you deny being demoted for these charges.
Answer me now!
- I cannot deny it.
- You were demoted?
- For insubordination?
- On occasion, I have disobeyed orders.
Were you obeying or disobeying orders when you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?
I didn't know about it until we boarded the ship.
You still deny the Enterprise fired on Kronos One?
And you still deny your men beamed aboard and shot the Chancellor?
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I didn't witness.
Are you aware that as the captain of a ship, you are responsible for the actions of your men?
I am.
If it's proved that members of your crew carried out the assassination...
- They're setting us up.
Your Honours!
- Do not answer.
Captain Kirk, you will answer the question.
As Captain I'm responsible for the crew under my command.
Your Honours, the state rests.
Send to Commander Enterprise.
"We stand ready to assist you.
Captain Sulu, U.S.S. Excelsior."
It is the determination of this court that the prisoners are guilty as charged.
I wish to note for the record that all the evidence is circumstantial.
I beg the court to consider this when pronouncing its sentence.
So noted.
Captain James T. Kirk, Dr. Leonard McCoy.
In the interest of fostering amity for the forthcoming peace talks, the sentence of death is commuted.
It is the judgement of this court that, without possibility of reprieve or parole, you be taken from this place to the dilithium mines on the penal asteroid of Rura Penthe.
There to spend the rest of your natural lives.
Rura Penthe!
Known throughout the galaxy as the alien's graveyard.
Better to kill them now and get it over with.
Lieutenant.
The torpedo hit once again, please.
Hold.
It is Enterprise.
We fired.
That is not possible!
All weapons visually accounted for, sir.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains must be the truth.
What does that mean?
That if we cannot have fired those torpedoes, someone else did.
They didn't fire on themselves and there are no other ships present.
- There was a neutron surge.
- Not from us.
A neutron surge that big could only be produced by another ship.
- Kronos One?
- Too far away.
Very near us.
Possibly beneath us.
If there were a ship beneath us, the Klingons would have seen it.
Would they?
- A Bird of Prey?
- A Bird of Prey.
- Cloaked?
- They can't fired when they're cloaked.
All things being equal, I would agree.
However, things are not equal.
This one can.
- We must inform Starfleet Command.
- Of what?
A new weapon that's invisible?
They'll call us raving lunatics.
They'll say we'll say anything to exonerate the Captain.
And they would be correct.
We have no evidence.
Only a theory which happens to fit the facts.
Assuming you're right.
Why would they fire on their own President?
Indeed.
This ship will be searched from bow to stern.
I do not understand.
If there was a ship underneath us surely the assassins beamed aboard from that vessel, not Enterprise.
You're forgetting something, Mr Chekov.
According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
If we did, the killers are here.
If we did not, whoever altered the data banks is here.
In either case, what we are looking for is here.
- What are we looking for, sir?
- Lieutenant.
Two pairs of gravity boots.
This is the gulag Rura Penthe.
There is no stockades, no guard tower, no electronic frontier.
Only a magnetic shield prevents beaming.
Punishment means exile from prison to the surface.
On the surface, nothing can survive.
Work well, and you will be treated well.
Work badly, and you will die.
Oh, my God!
The universal translator has been confiscated.
I'm sorry...?
He's definitely on about something, Jim.
If this is your spot, we'll move on.
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
- He's got it.
- And your coat.
I'm afraid not.
It wouldn't fit.
- Thanks.
- This will help keep you warm.
- I'm Martia.
You're Kirk and McCoy.
- How did you know that?
We don't get many presidential assassins.
- We didn't kill Gorkon.
- Of course not.
- But there's a reward for your death.
- That figures.
We've been set up.
Somebody up there wants you out of the way.
- Any progress?
- None.
A crew of 300 are looking everywhere, but the killers may still be among them.
Surely they have disposed of these boots by now.
Would it not have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
Logic must give way to physics.
Gravity wasn't restored when they escaped.
Without the boots, they would have floated off the transporter pads.
Why not simply vaporize them?
Like this?
As you know, no one can fire an unauthorized phaser aboard a starship.
Suppose, when they returned, they threw the boots into the refuse.
I'm having the refuse searched.
If I'm correct, those boots will cling to the killer's necks like Tiberian bats.
They couldn't escape without them nor throw them out the window.
Those boots are here.
Somewhere.
- Did someone fire off a phaser?
- It's alright.
It's nothing.
Mr Spock, Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
- Who fired the...
- Ah, Mr Scott.
I hear you have difficulty with the warp drive.
How long do you need for repair?
There's nothing wrong with the bloody thing.
If we return to space dock, the killers can dispose of their footwear and we will never see the Captain or Dr. McCoy alive again.
- It could take weeks.
- Thank you.
Val'eris, inform Starfleet our warp drive is inoperative.
- A lie?
- An error.
We have lost all contact with the Captain and Dr. McCoy.
Yes, at the moment they're surrounded by a magnetic shield.
But if I know the Captain, he is deep into planning his escape.
You've got him where you want him, Jim!
- Are you alright?
- I think so.
- They'll respect you now.
- I was lucky that thing had knees.
That was not his knee.
Not everybody keep their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Anything you want to tell me?
See what you can do for him.
Let him know we're not holding a grudge.
Suppose he's holding a grudge?
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
- Do you want to get out of here?
- There's got to be a way.
Three months before retirement.
What a way to finish.
- We're not finished.
- Speak for yourself.
One day, one night...
Kobayashi Maru!
Bones!
Are you afraid of the future?
I believe that was the general idea that I was trying to convey.
- I don't mean this future.
- What is this - multiple choice?
Some people are afraid...
of what might happen.
- I was terrified.
- What terrified you, specifically?
No more neutral zone.
I was used to hating Klingons.
It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his words.
- Spock was right.
- We all felt exactly the same.
No.
Somebody felt a lot worse.
I'm beginning to understand why.
If you've got any bright ideas, now is the time.
Time is the problem.
You and I are nothing.
You heard the judge - the peace conference is on again.
Whoever killed Gorkon is bound to attempt another assassination.
Unless we can get out of here.
It's me
- Martia.
Listen.
No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
- Except us.
- It is possible.
I know how to get outside the shield.
- How do we fit in?
- Getting outside the shield is easy.
After that, you have to get us off the surface before we freeze.
Can you?
- It's possible.
- I can't make it alone.
You're the likeliest candidate to come here for months.
Candidate for what?
Go to lift 7 in the morning for mining duty.
I'll see you there.
Don't disappoint me.
- What is it with you, anyway?
- Still think we're finished?
More than ever.
Sorry to wake you, sir.
Starfleet requests any data we have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
What?
They're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to space dock, sir.
Signal Starfleet that we have no idea location Enterprise.
- Sir?
- You have hearing problems?
No, sir.
Klingon blood.
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
This is the first evidence which corroborates our theory.
Now we go to Starfleet?
We expand our search to include uniforms.
All uniforms?
Clear, sir.
Make a hole.
Coming through.
Coming through.
Sir!
Sir!
- I think we've been had.
- No, you weren't, Doctor.
Get off at the first level.
Follow the gang into the mine.
They don't take girls.
- You are crewman Dax?
- Yes.
What is the problem?
Perhaps you know Russian epic of Cinderella?
If shoe fits - wear it.
Mr Chekov...
Watch me.
What kind of creature is this?
Last night you two were...
Get in.
Come on.
We don't have a lot of time.
Hurry!
Up there.
Come on - climb!
Here, you'll need these.
Quickly!
Stay close.
- There they are.
- They emerge from the beaming shield.
Mr Scott, start your engines.
Mr Chekov, set course for Rura Penthe.
Mr Spock, Rura Penthe is deep inside the Klingon frontier.
- If we're discovered...
- Correct.
We need a feat of linguistic legerdemain and intrepidity before the Captain and Dr. McCoy freeze to death.
- Leave me, I'm finished.
- No!
Bones, I'm wearing a viridium patch on my back.
Spock slapped it there before we went on Gorkon's ship.
That cunning little Vulcan.
Come on!
We're in the clear.
Now that we're outside the shield, they can locate us two sectors away.
If they're even looking for us.
This is listening post Morska.
What ship is that, over?
We must respond.
A universal translator would be recognised.
We am thy freighter...
Ursva.
Six weeks out of Kronos.
"What is your destination, over? "
We is condemning food things and supplies.
Don't catch any bugs.
Would you mind explaining that little trick you do?
- I'm a Chameloid.
- I've heard about you.
Shape-shifters.
I thought you were mythical.
Give a girl a chance, Captain.
It takes a lot of effort.
I don't doubt it.
Stop me if I'm wrong, but do we have any way of knowing whether this is the real you?
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.
We're outside the shield.
Now it's your turn, Captain.
If you say so.
Are you crazy?
!
She didn't need our help.
Where did you get these convenient clothes?
Don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue.
It's to let them know where we are.
Ask her what she's getting in return.
A full pardon... which doesn't cover this.
An accident wasn't good enough.
Come on, Spock.
Good enough for one.
Two would have looked suspicious.
Killed while attempting escape.
That's convincing for both.
Surprise!
- Your friends are late.
- They'll be along.
- I can't believe I kissed you.
- Must have been your lifelong ambition.
Isn't it time you became something else?
I like it here.
Well, well, well...
What took you so long?
Kill him, he's the one.
Not me, you idiot - him!
- No witnesses.
- Killed while trying to escape.
- Damned clever, if you ask me.
- It's a classic.
- That's what he wanted.
- Who?
Who wanted us killed?
Since you're all going to die anyway, why not tell you?
His name is...
Damn it!
What the hell!
Son of a...!
Couldn't you have waited two seconds?
He was about to explain the whole thing.
- You want to go back?
- Absolutely not!
This is the bridge.
We're still in Klingon space.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
They were beamed aboard a Federation Starship.
I could trace...
Escaped.
Kirk cannot know the location of the peace conference.
Are you sure?
Will you take that chance?
Helmsman, make course to intercept Enterprise.
The Klingons have a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked.
- She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
- So that's it.
We believe that Gorkon's murderers are aboard this ship.
- Has the peace conference begun?
- Who knows?
The location is secret.
- There's always something.
- Captain!
Mr Spock!
I found the uniforms with the Klingon blood on them.
But the uniforms belong to these two men.
Burke and Samno.
Not anymore.
Phaser on "stun" at close range.
First rule of assassination - kill the assassins.
- Now we're back to square one.
- Can I talk to you?
- Why weren't they vaporized?
- It would set off the alarm.
It's possible.
Now hear this.
Now hear this.
Court reporter to sick bay.
Code blue - urgent.
Statements to be taken at once from Yeomen Burke and Samno.
Repeat, court reporter to sick bay.
Code blue - urgent.
Statements to be taken.
Repeat, statements to be taken from Yeomen Burke and Samno.
You have to shoot.
If you are logical, you have to shoot.
- I do not want to.
- What you want is irrelevant.
What you've chosen is at hand.
I'd just as soon you didn't.
The operation is over.
I did not fire.
You cannot prove anything.
Yes, I can.
At my trial my personal log was used against me.
How long did you wait outside my quarters before I noticed you?
You knew?
I tried to tell you, but you would not listen.
Neither of us was hearing very well that night.
There were things I tried to tell you, about having faith.
You have betrayed the Federation.
All of you.
- And what have you've been doing?
- Saving Starfleet.
Klingons cannot be trusted.
Sir...
You said so yourself.
They killed your son.
Did you not wish Gorkon dead?
"Let them die", you said.
Did I misinterpret you?
And you were right.
They conspired with us to assassinate their own Chancellor.
How trustworthy can they be?
Klingons and Federation members conspiring together.
- Who is "us"?
- All who stands to lose from peace.
Names, Lieutenant.
My comrades will make certain all your transmissions are jammed.
- Names, Lieutenant!
- I do not remember.
A lie?
A choice.
Spock.
Admiral Cartwright.
From Starfleet?
Who else?
General...
Chang.
- Who else?
- Romulan Ambassador and others.
Where is the peace conference?
Where is the peace conference?
She does not know.
Then we're dead.
I have been dead before.
Contact Excelsior.
- She'll have the co-ordinates.
- I've already got it, sir.
- Standing by, Captain Kirk.
- Sulu.
You realize that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations.
I'm sorry, Captain.
Yourmessage is breaking up.
Bless you, Sulu.
Where is the peace conference?
They'll attempt another assassination.
It's at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border.
I'm sending the co-ordinates on a coded frequency.
We'll need more than that.
There's a Bird of Prey on the look-out for us that can fire when cloaked.
Surely not.
How many of those things are there?
Come on, Lieutenant.
- Just the prototype.
- Do you hear that?
I'm getting under way now.
We're in Alpha Quadrant.
The chances of our reaching the conference in time are slim.
- When does this conference start?
- According to my information - today.
- Thank you, Captain Sulu.
- Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
Spock?
I prefer it dark.
- Dining on ashes?
- You were right.
It was arrogant presumption on my part that got us into this situation.
You and the Doctor might have been killed.
The night is young.
You said it yourself, it was logical.
Peace is worth a few personal risks.
You're a great one for logic.
I'm a great one for rushing in where angels fear to tread.
We're both extremists.
Reality is probably somewhere in between.
I couldn't get past the death of my son.
I was prejudiced by her accomplishments as a Vulcan.
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was.
Is it possible that we two, you and I, have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?
Would that constitute a joke?
- It wasn't your fault.
- I was responsible.
- For no actions but your own.
- That's not what you said at your trial.
That was as captain of the ship.
Human beings...
We both know that I am not human.
Do you want to know something?
Everybody's human.
I find that remark... insulting.
Come, I need you.
Madam Chancellor, members of the diplomatic corps honoured guests.
The United Federation of Planets welcomes you to Camp Khitomer.
She's out here somewhere.
- But if she's cloaked...
- Then all we have is a radiation surge.
By the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes.
2.06... 2.03...
- Close enough to beam down?
- Not yet.
In two minutes. 1 .58.
Go to impulse power for Khitomer.
Let us redefine progress to mean that just because we can do a thing it does not necessarily follow that we must do that thing.
- Uhura?
- Nothing, Captain.
If she's here, she's rigged for silent running.
Coming up on transporter range in 57 seconds.
Transporter room.
Stand by to beam down.
53... 48 seconds.
44...
I can see you, Kirk.
Chang.
Can you see me?
Now be honest, Captain.
Warrior to warrior.
You do prefer it this way, don't you?
As it was meant to be.
No peace in our time.
"Once more unto the breach, dearfriends. "
- This is fun.
- Reverse engines.
All astern.
One and a half impulse power.
Back off!
What's she doing?
What's she waiting for?
Probably attempting to ascertain why we are reversing.
Wondering whether we detect her.
Incoming!
- In range?
- Not yet, sir.
Come on!
- She'll fly apart.
- Fly her apart, then!
Many speculated about my father's motives.
Some said he was an idealist.
Others said he had no choice.
If Praxis had not exploded, his idealism wouldn't have found expression.
We are a proud race.
We are here because we intend to go on being proud.
- Go to auxiliary power!
- Auxiliary circuits destroyed.
"Tickle us, do we not laugh?
Prick us, do we not bleed?"
"Wrong us, shall we not revenge?"
Gas.
Gas, Captain.
Under impulse power she expands fuel, like all vessels.
We call it "plasma", but it is merely ionised gas.
What about our equipment to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
The thing's got to have a tail-pipe.
Doctor, would you assist me in performing surgery on a torpedo?
Fascinating.
Hard to starboard.
The proposed agenda is as follows:
The evacuation of Kronos has been calculated within the 50 Earth year time span.
Phase 1 - preparation for evacuation...
Captain, she's packing quite a wallop.
Shields weakening.
Shields up!
Alright, now we're giving them something else to shoot at.
The game's afoot.
- Excelsior's been hit!
- "Our revels now are ended", Kirk.
"Cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war."
- Bones, where's my torpedo?
- Bet you wished you'd stayed in bed.
Shields collapsing!
The key, please.
Time is short.
- The hull has been compromised.
- I wonder how bad.
Connect echo-bars.
...discuss the report on phase 2.
- Alter circuit A.
- Sensor.
...we commence within minutes of the preparation.
- "I am constant as the Northern star."
- I'd give real money, if he'd shut up.
Plate, please.
...and assimilation will consume...
We've got a heart beat.
...with the Klingon Empire...
Key, please.
- Where's that torpedo?
- She's ready.
Lock and load!
Fire!
"To be... or not" "to be."
Target that explosion and fire.
Fire!
This work will occupy us throughout most of the week.
I hope that the delegation can implement the provisions of Phase 1 by the first of next month.
As you know, time is of the essence.
Out of the way!
Mr President!
Mr President!
Kirk, Enterprise.
Protect the Chancellor!
- Arrest those men!
- Arrest yourself!
We've got a full confession.
- This is not Klingon blood.
- Cartwright.
Just a minute.
Stardate 9521.6.
Captain's Log, U.S.S. Excelsior.
Hikaru Sulu commanding.
After three years,
I've concluded my first assignment as master of this vessel, cataloguing gaseous planetary anomalies in Beta Quadrant.
We're heading home under full impulse power.
I am pleased to report that ship and crew have functioned well.
According to this, we've completed our survey of the entire sector.
I have an energy wave at 240 degrees mark 6 port, sir.
Visual.
My God.
Shields.
Shields!
She's not answering her helm.
Starboard thruster.
Turn her into the wave.
Aye.
Quarter impulse power.
Damage report.
Checking all systems, Captain.
Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
Negative, sir.
The subspace shockwave originated at bearing 3-2-3 mark 75.
Location...
It's Praxis, sir.
It's a Klingon moon.
Praxis is their key energy production facility.
Send to Klingon High Command.
This is Excelsior, a Federation starship.
We have monitored a large explosion in your sector.
Do you require assistance?
Aye, sir.
Mr. Valtane, any more data?
Yes, sir.
I've confirmed the location of Praxis, but...
What is it?
I cannot confirm the existence of Praxis.
Onscreen.
Magnify.
Computer enhancement.
Praxis?
What's left of it, sir.
Captain, I'm getting a message from Praxis.
Let's have it.
This is Brigadier Kerla speaking for the High Command.
There has been an incident on Praxis.
However, everything is under control.
We have no need for assistance.
Obey treaty stipulations and remain outside the neutral zone.
This transmission ends now.
An incident?
Do we report this, sir?
Are you kidding?
What are we doing here?
Maybe they're throwing us a retirement party.
That suits me.
I just bought a boat.
This had better be good.
I'm supposed to be chairing a seminar at the Academy.
Captain, isn't this just for top brass?
If we're all here, where's Sulu?
Captain Sulu.
On assignment.
Where's Spock?
This briefing is classified.
Ladies and gentlemen, the CinC.
As you were.
To break this information down succinctly, the Klingon Empire has roughly 50 years of life left to it.
For full details, I'm turning this briefing over to the Federation's special envoy.
Good morning.
Two months ago, a Federation starship monitored an explosion on the Klingon moon Praxis.
We believe it was caused by over-mining and insufficient safety precautions.
The moon's decimation means the deadly pollution of their ozone.
They will have depleted their supply of oxygen in approximately 50 Earth years.
Due to their enormous military budget, the Klingon economy does not have the resources with which to combat this catastrophe.
Last month, at the behest of the Vulcan ambassador,
I opened a dialogue with Gorkon,
Chancellor of the Klingon High Council.
He proposes to commence negotiations at once.
Negotiations for what?
The dismantling of our space stations and starbases along the neutral zone, an end to almost 70 years of unremitting hostility, which the Klingons can no longer afford.
Bill, are we talking about mothballing the Starfleet?
Well, I'm sure that our exploration and scientific programs would be unaffected, Captain, but...
I must protest.
To offer Klingons safe haven within Federation space is suicide.
Klingons would become the alien trash of the galaxy, and if we dismantle the fleet, we'd be defenseless before an aggressive species with a foothold on our territory.
The opportunity here is to bring them to their knees.
Then we'll be in a far better position to dictate terms.
Sir?
Captain Kirk.
The Klingons have never been trustworthy.
I'm forced to agree with Admiral Cartwright.
This is a terrifying idea.
It is imperative that we act now to support the Gorkon initiative lest more conservative elements persuade his empire that it is better to attempt a military solution and die fighting.
You, Captain Kirk, are to be our first olive branch.
We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon vessel which is bringing Chancellor Gorkon to Earth and to escort him safely through Federation space.
Me?
Well, there are Klingons who feel the same way about the peace treaty as yourself and Admiral Cartwright, but they'll think twice about attacking the Enterprise under your command.
I have personally vouched for you in this matter, Captain.
You have personally vouched?
You will extend Chancellor Gorkon full diplomatic courtesy, Captain Kirk.
But a full ambassador would be better equipped...
If there's no further business,
I wish you and your crew Godspeed.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
I remind you, this meeting is classified.
I don't know whether to congratulate you or not, Jim.
I wouldn't.
We volunteered?
There is an old Vulcan proverb.
Only Nixon could go to China.
How could you vouch for me?
That's arrogant presumption.
My father requested that I open negotiations...
I know your father's the Vulcan ambassador, for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this.
They're animals.
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here.
Don't believe them.
Don't trust them.
They are dying.
Let them die.
Has it occurred to you, that this crew is due to stand down in three months?
We've done our bit for king and country.
You should have trusted me.
Control, this is SD-103, approach to spacedock.
Over.
SD-103, you are clear to deliver Captain Kirk and party to NCC-1701 Alpha.
Over.
Captain on the Bridge.
As you were, Lieutenant...
Valeris, sir.
We were told that you needed a helmsman, so I volunteered.
Lieutenant, it is agreeable to see you again.
Lieutenant was the first Vulcan to be graduated at the top of her class at the academy.
You must be very proud.
I don't believe so, sir.
She's a Vulcan, all right.
Let's get this over with.
Departure stations.
Scotty.
Aye, sir?
Did you find the engine room?
Right where I left it, sir.
Standby.
Uhura, get me the dockmaster.
Control tower reading, sir.
Control, this is Enterprise, requesting permission to depart.
This is Control, Enterprise.
Permission to depart granted.
Thirty seconds for port gates.
Clear all moorings.
Awaiting port gates from this mark.
All moorings clear.
Aft thrusters.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
One-quarter impulse power.
Captain, may I remind you that regulations specify thrusters only while in spacedock?
Jim?
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
Aye, sir.
Captain's Log, Stardate 9522.6.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I could never forgive them for the death of my boy.
It seems to me our mission to escort the Chancellor of the Klingon High Council to a peace summit is problematic at best.
Spock says this could be an historic occasion, and I'd like to believe him, but how on earth can history get past people like me?
Sorry.
You could have knocked.
We are almost at the rendezvous, sir.
I thought that you would like to know.
Right.
Permission to speak freely, sir.
It is an honor to serve with you.
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant.
I've always wanted to try that, sir.
You've done well, Valeris.
As your sponsor at the academy,
I have followed your career with satisfaction, and as a Vulcan, you've exceeded my expectations.
I do not understand this representation.
It is a depiction from ancient Earth mythology, the expulsion from Paradise.
Why keep it in your quarters?
It is a reminder to me that all things end.
It is of endings that I wish to speak.
Sir, I address you as a kindred intellect.
Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
History is replete with turning points, Lieutenant.
You must have faith.
Faith?
That the universe will unfold as it should.
But is that logical?
Surely we must...
Logic, logic and logic.
Logic is the beginning of wisdom, Valeris, not the end.
This will be my final voyage on board this vessel as a member of her crew.
Nature abhors a vacuum.
I intend you to replace me.
I could only succeed you, sir.
Now hear this.
All officers to the Bridge.
Klingon battle cruiser off the port bow.
All officers to the Bridge.
Captain on the Bridge.
Shall we raise our shields, Captain?
Never been this close.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
Uhura, hailing frequencies.
Aye, sir.
Right standard rudder.
Bring us alongside.
Right standard rudder.
Z plus 5 degrees.
Channel is open, Captain.
This is the Starship Enterprise,
Captain James T. Kirk commanding.
This is Kronos One.
I am Chancellor Gorkon.
Chancellor, we've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting on Earth.
Thank you, Captain.
Would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard the Enterprise with my officers, as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We would be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
I shall look forward to that.
Well, I hope you're happy.
Captain, there is a supply of Romulan ale aboard.
It might make the evening pass more smoothly.
Officer thinking, Lieutenant.
Guess who's coming to dinner.
Energize.
Chancellor Gorkon.
Captain Kirk.
May I present Captain Spock, whom I believe you know.
Captain, face to face at last.
You have my thanks.
Chancellor.
Gentlemen, this is my daughter Azetbur,
my military adviser, Brigadier Kerla, and this is General Chang, my chief of staff.
I have so wanted to meet you, Captain.
I'm not sure how to take that.
Sincere admiration, Kirk.
From one warrior to another.
Right.
This way.
I think you might enjoy a brief tour.
They all look alike.
What about that smell?
You know only top-of-the-line models can even talk...
You men have work?
Yes, ma'am.
Yes, ma'am.
Then snap to it.
I offer a toast.
The undiscover'd country,
the future.
The undiscover'd country.
The undiscover'd country.
Hamlet, Act III, Scene 1.
You've not experienced Shakespeare until you have read him in the original Klingon.
Captain Kirk, I thought Romulan ale was illegal.
One of the advantages of being 1,000 light-years from Federation Headquarters.
To you, Chancellor Gorkon, one of the architects of our future.
Chancellor.
Chancellor.
Perhaps we are looking at something of that future here.
Tell me, Captain Kirk, would you be willing to give up Starfleet?
I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace.
Far be it for me to dispute my first officer, but Starfleet has always been at the fore...
Captain, there's no need to mince words.
In space, all warriors are cold warriors.
General, are you fond of
Shakespeare?
We do believe all planets have a sovereign claim to inalienable human rights.
Inalien?
If you could only hear yourselves.
Human rights.
Why, the very name is racist.
The Federation is no more than a Homo Sapiens Only club.
Present company excepted, of course.
In any case, we know where this is leading.
The annihilation of our culture.
That's not true.
No?
No.
To be, or not to be.
That is the question which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk.
We need breathing room.
Earth, Hitler, 1938.
I beg your pardon?
Well...
I see we have a long way to go.
We must do this again sometime.
You don't trust me, do you?
I don't blame you.
If there is to be a brave new world, our generation is going to have the hardest time living in it.
Captain Spock.
Chancellor.
Madam.
Captain.
Well, most kind.
Parting is such sweet sorrow, Captain.
Have we not heard the chimes at midnight?
Thank God.
Did you see the way they ate?
Terrible table manners.
I doubt that our own behavior will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy.
I'm going to sleep this off.
Please let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight.
I'm going to go find a pot of black coffee.
The Enterprise hosted Chancellor Gorkon and company to dinner last night.
Our manners weren't exactly,
Emily Post.
Note to the galley,
Romulan ale no longer to be served at diplomatic functions.
Captain Kirk, will you please join me on the Bridge?
Captain Kirk?
Captain.
What is it?
I find this curious.
Spock, I'm really tired.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
Where?
Strangely enough, it appears to be emanating from us.
The Enterprise?
Valeris, do you know anything about a radiation surge?
Sir?
Chekov?
Only the size of my head.
I know what you mean.
What's happened?
We have fired on the Chancellor's ship.
Torpedo Room, please confirm.
Have we fired?
0-6...
Uhura, monitor.
Aye, sir.
Direct hit.
Confirmed, sir.
We've lost gravity!
We are betrayed!
This is the Bridge.
Do you read?
Do you read?
Torpedo bay, did we fire those torpedoes?
Negative, Captain.
According to inventory, we're still fully loaded.
Find Chang.
Unable to confirm or deny firing of two photon torpedoes.
Hailing frequencies.
Aye, sir.
Kronos One, this is Enterprise.
Do you read?
Over.
Repeat.
Kronos One...
It's very hard to make out, Captain.
There's been some weapons firing and a lot of shouting.
She is still listing.
She's spinning out of control.
Restoring auxiliary gravity.
Have you not a shred of decency in you, Kirk?
We come in peace, and you blatantly defile that peace.
For that, I shall blow you out of the stars.
We haven't fired.
Captain.
According to our databanks, we have, twice.
Captain, they're coming about.
They're preparing to fire.
Shields up, Captain?
Captain, our shields.
Shields up, Captain?
Signal our surrender.
Captain?
We surrender!
This is Enterprise.
We surrender.
If they fire at us with our shields down...
I repeat.
We surrender.
we will not be able to respond.
Repeat.
Enterprise surrenders.
Are we firing torpedoes?
I wish I knew.
Well, it sure looks like it.
I'm going aboard.
Spock, you have the conn.
I am responsible for involving you in this.
I will go.
No, I'll go.
You'll be responsible for getting me out of this.
We'll not be the instigators of full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
I'm going, too.
They may need a doctor.
Perhaps you're right.
Uhura, tell them we're coming, and tell them we're unarmed.
Aye, sir.
Have you lost your mind?
I give you my word, I don't understand what has happened.
We're here to help.
Follow me.
Chancellor Gorkon.
My God.
What has happened here?
You dare to feign ignorance?
What happened?
With a direct torpedo hit, you crippled our entire gravitational field, and two of your Starfleet crew beamed aboard wearing magnetic boots and did this.
Aren't you carrying a surgeon?
We were until this disgrace.
Well, then for God sakes, man, let me help.
I've got a pulse.
We can move him.
I'm gonna need some light.
Can we get him up on this table?
Hold him.
Hold him while I stabilize him.
I said hold him.
Sweet Jesus.
Can you...
Jim, I don't even know his anatomy.
His wounds are not closing.
He's killing him!
He's gone into some kind of damned arrest.
Come on, damn it!
Come on!
He's not responding.
Don't let it end this way, Captain.
Under article number 184 of your interstellar law,
I'm placing you under arrest.
You are charged with assassinating, our Chancellor of the High Council.
He tried to save him.
They've been arrested.
Mr. Spock, we've got to do something.
I assume command of this ship as of 0230 hours.
Commander Uhura, please notify Starfleet Headquarters.
Tell them precisely what has taken place and request instructions.
Aye, sir.
We cannot allow them to be taken back to Kronos as prisoners.
What do you suggest, Lieutenant?
Opening fire will not retrieve them, and an armed conflict is precisely what the Captain wished to avoid.
We will be able to follow the Captain's movements.
How did you achieve this, sir?
Time is precious, Lieutenant.
We must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight.
According to our databank, this ship fired those torpedoes.
No way.
I sympathize Mr. Scott, but we need evidence.
Please accompany me.
And if we cannot piece together what happened?
What then, sir?
In that case, Mr. Chekov, it resides in the purview of the diplomats.
The Chancellor of the High Council is dead!
The result of an unprovoked attack while he travelled to see you under a flag of truce, on a mission of peace.
Captain Kirk was legally arrested for the crime.
May I remind you that he and Dr McCoy boarded Kronos One of their own free will?
None of these facts are in dispute, Mr. President.
I have ordered a full-scale investigation.
In the meantime...
In the meantime, we expect the Federation to abide by the articles of interstellar law, which you claim to cherish.
Kirk and Dr McCoy will stand trial for the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon.
Out of the question.
Ambassador Sarek, there must be some way to extradite these men.
Mr. President, I share a measure of personal responsibility in this matter, but I am obliged to confirm my esteemed colleague's legal interpretation.
What is the position of the Romulan government,
Ambassador Nanclus?
I must concur with my colleagues.
But you can't possibly believe that James Kirk assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council.
Mr. President, I don't know what to believe.
I'm waiting for your answer, sir.
This president is not above the law.
Report back at once.
Do you copy?
At once.
Enterprise to report back on the double.
Do you read?
At once.
We're to report back at once.
We cannot abandon Captain Kirk and Dr McCoy.
Of course not.
Four hundred years ago on the planet Earth, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by automation flung their wooden shoes called sabot into the machines to stop them.
Hence the word sabotage.
We are experiencing technical malfunction.
All backup systems inoperative.
Excellent.
I mean, too bad.
Mr. President,
I've been named Chancellor by the High Council in my father's place.
Madam Chancellor, you have my sincerest condolences on your recent loss.
I want to assure you that this shameful deed will not...
Mr. President, let us come to the point.
You want this conference to go forward, and so did my father.
I will attend in one week on one condition.
We will not extradite the prisoners, and you will make no attempt to rescue them in a military operation.
We would consider any such attempt an act of war.
We hope you'll be our guest here on Earth.
After recent events, you will understand if I say I prefer a neutral site, and in the interests of security, let us keep the location secret for now.
As you wish, Madam Chancellor.
Attack them now, while we still can!
Attack or be slaves in their world.
We can take whole by force, what they propose to divide.
War is obsolete, General, as we are in danger of becoming.
Better to die on our feet than live on our knees.
He can't be!
Your father was killed for what he wanted.
The peace process will go forward.
Kirk...
Kirk will pay for my father's death.
It's a damn show trial.
Kirk!
Kirk!
Kirk!
Kirk!
The Enterprise fired on Kronos One without provocation.
The Chancellor and his advisers... having been lulled into a false sense of security by an invitation to a state dinner aboard Captain Kirk's vessel at precisely 1930 hours that same evening.
Call your first witness.
After the first shot, we lost our gravitational field.
I found myself weightless and unable to function.
Then two Starfleet crewmen came walking towards me.
But perhaps they merely wore Starfleet uniforms.
That remark is purely speculative.
I move that it be stricken.
Colonel Worf, we are interested in facts, not theories.
If the gravitational unit was not functioning, how could these men be walking?
They appeared to be wearing magnetic boots.
Gravity boots.
Dr McCoy, would you be so good as to tell me, what is your current medical status?
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
You have a singular wit, Doctor.
For 27 years, I've been ship surgeon aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.
In three months, I stand down.
You know, I believe that you consumed a rather generous amount of Romulan ale in the officers' mess on the night in question.
Am I right, Doctor?
Objection!
Sustained.
We all did.
All of us.
That doesn't mean...
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
Barely.
Now be careful, Doctor.
Have you ever, in your past, saved patients as barely alive as he?
I didn't have the medical knowledge I needed for Klingon anatomy.
I see.
You were there.
You say you are due for retirement.
May I ask, do your hands shake?
Objection!
I was nervous.
No.
You were incompetent.
You were incompetent!
Whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink, the court will have to determine.
My God, man!
I tried to save him!
I tried to save him.
I was desperate to save him.
He was the last best hope in the universe for peace.
The witness is excused.
There we have it, citizens.
We have finally established the particulars of the crime, and now we come to the architect of this tragic affair,
James Tiberius Kirk.
What would your favorite author say, Captain?
Let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings.
Tell us your sad story, Kirk.
Tell us that you planned to take revenge for the death of your son.
That's not true.
Objection!
Captain Kirk has not been identified as the assassin.
Sustained.
I offer into the record, this excerpt from the Captain's personal log.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I have never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Again.
Again!
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I have never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Are those your words?
Those words were spoken by me.
Objection!
My client's political views are not on trial here.
On the contrary!
Captain Kirk's views and motives are indeed at the very heart of the matter.
This officer's record shows him to be an insubordinate, unprincipled, career-minded opportunist, with a history of violating the chain of command whenever it suited him!
Continue.
Indeed, the record shows that Captain Kirk once held the rank of Admiral, and that Admiral Kirk was broken for taking matters into his own hands in defiance of regulations of the law.
Do you deny being demoted for these charges?
Don't wait for the translation!
Answer me now!
I cannot deny it.
You were demoted?
Yes.
For insubordination?
On occasion, I have disobeyed orders.
And were you obeying or disobeying orders when you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?
I didn't know about the assassination until we boarded the ship.
You still deny the Enterprise fired on Kronos One?
Well...
Your Honors, please!
And you still deny your men beamed aboard and shot the Chancellor?
Objection!
I cannot confirm or deny actions I did not witness.
Captain Kirk, are you aware that as the captain of a starship, you are required to be responsible for the actions of your men?
I am.
And if it should be proved that members of your crew did, in fact, carry out such an assassination...
Jim, they're setting us up.
Your Honors...
Do not answer!
Captain Kirk, you will answer the question.
As captain,
I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
Your Honors, the State rests.
Send to Commander Enterprise.
We stand ready to assist you.
Captain Sulu, U.S.S. Excelsior.
It is the determination of this court that the prisoners are guilty as charged.
I wish to note for the record that the evidence against my clients is entirely circumstantial.
I beg the court to consider this when pronouncing its sentence.
So noted.
Captain James T. Kirk, Dr Leonard McCoy, in the interest of fostering amity for the forthcoming peace talks, the sentence of death is commuted.
It is the judgment of this court that, without possibility of reprieve or parole, you be taken from this place to the dilithium mines on the penal asteroid of Rura Penthe, there to spend the rest of your natural lives.
Rura Penthe?
Known throughout the galaxy as the aliens' graveyard.
Better to kill them now and get it over with.
Lieutenant, the torpedo hit once again, please.
Hold.
It is Enterprise.
We fired.
That is not possible.
All weapons visually accounted for, sir.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.
What exactly does that mean?
It means that if we cannot have fired those torpedoes, someone else did.
Well, they did not fire on themselves, and there were no other ships present.
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
Not from us!
A neutron surge that big could only be produced by another ship.
Kronos One?
Too far away.
Very near us.
Possibly beneath us.
If there were a ship beneath us, the Klingons would have seen her.
Would they?
A bird-of-prey.
A bird-of-prey.
Cloaked?
A bird-of-prey cannot fire when she's cloaked.
All things being equal, Mr. Scott, I would agree.
However, things are not equal.
This one can.
We must inform Starfleet Command.
Inform them of what, a new weapon that is invisible?
Raving lunatics, that's what they'll call us.
They'll say that we're so desperate to exonerate the Captain that we'll say anything.
And they would be correct.
We have no evidence, only a theory which happens to fit the facts.
Assuming you're right, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own president?
Indeed.
This ship will be searched from bow to stern.
Lieutenant Valeris, you'll be in charge.
Aye, sir.
I do not understand.
If there was a ship underneath us, surely the assassins beamed aboard from that vessel, not Enterprise.
You're forgetting something, Mr. Chekov.
According to our databanks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
If we did, the killers are here.
If we did not, whoever altered the databanks is here.
In either case, what we are looking for is here.
What are we looking for, sir?
Lieutenant?
Two pairs of gravity boots.
This is the gulag Rura Penthe.
There is no stockade, no guard tower, no electronic frontier.
Only a magnetic shield prevents beaming.
Punishment means exile from prison to the surface.
On the surface, nothing can survive.
Work well and you will be treated well.
Work badly and you will die.
Oh, my God.
The universal translator's been confiscated.
I'm sorry?
He's definitely on about something, Jim.
If this is your spot, we'll move on.
He wants your obedience to the brotherhood of aliens.
He's got it.
And your coat.
I'm afraid not.
Besides, it wouldn't fit.
Thanks.
This will help keep you warm.
I'm Martia.
You're Kirk and McCoy, I presume.
How'd you know that?
We don't get many presidential assassins.
We didn't kill Gorkon.
Of course not, but there is a reward for your death.
It figures.
We've been set up all along.
Somebody up there wants you out of the way.
Nothing in here.
Nothing here.
Any progress?
None.
We have a crew of 300 turning their own quarters inside out, but the killers may still be among them.
Surely they have disposed of these boots by now.
Would it not have been logical to have left them on Gorkon's ship?
Even logic must give way to physics.
Gravity had not been restored by the time they escaped.
Without the boots, they would have floated off the Klingon transporter pads.
Why not simply vaporize them?
Like this?
At ease.
As you know, Commander Chekov, no one can fire an unauthorized phaser aboard a starship.
Suppose when they returned, they threw the boots into the refuse.
I'm having the refuse searched.
If my surmise is correct, those boots will cling to the killers' necks like a pair of Tiberian bats.
They could not make their escape without them, nor can they simply throw them out the window for all to see.
Those boots are here somewhere.
Did someone fire off a phaser?
It's all right.
It's nothing.
It's nothing.
Mr. Spock, Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
Who fired that...
Mr. Scott.
I understand you're having difficulty with the warp drive.
How much time do you require for repair?
There's nothing wrong with the bloody thing.
Mr. Scott, if we return to spacedock, the assassins will surely find a way to dispose of their incriminating footwear, and we will never see the Captain or Dr McCoy alive again.
It could take weeks, sir.
Thank you, Mr. Scott.
Valeris, please inform Starfleet Command our warp drive is inoperative.
A lie?
An error.
You understand we have lost all contact with the Captain and Dr McCoy.
Yes.
At the moment, they're surrounded by a magnetic shield.
However, if I know the Captain, by this time, he is deep into planning his escape.
You got him, Jim!
You got him where you want him!
You all right, Jim?
I think so.
They'll respect you now.
That's a comfort.
I was lucky that thing had knees.
That was not his knee.
Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Anything you want to tell me?
Bones, why don't you see what you can do for him?
Let him know we're not holding a grudge.
Suppose he's holding a grudge?
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
Do you want to get out of here?
There's gotta be a way.
Three months before retirement.
What a way to finish.
We're not finished.
No?
Speak for yourself.
One day, one night, Kobayashi Maru.
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
I believe that was the general idea that I was trying to convey.
I don't mean this future.
What is this, multiple choice?
Some people are afraid of what might happen.
I was terrified.
What terrified you, specifically?
No more neutral zone.
I was used to hating Klingons.
It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word.
Spock was right.
Try not to be too hard on yourself.
We all felt exactly the same.
No.
Somebody felt a lot worse.
I'm beginning to understand why.
Well, if you've got any bright ideas, now's the time.
Time's the problem.
You and I are nothing.
But you heard the judge.
The peace conference is on again.
Whoever killed Gorkon is bound to attempt another assassination.
Unless we can get out of here.
Kirk, it's me, Martia.
Listen, no one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
Except us.
It is possible.
I know how to get outside the shield.
How do we fit in?
Getting outside the shield is easy, but after that, it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze.
Can you?
It's possible.
I can't make it alone, and you're likeliest candidate to come in this hellhole for months.
Candidate for what?
Go to lift seven in the morning for mining duty.
I'll see you there.
Don't disappoint me.
What is it with you, anyway?
Still think we're finished?
More than ever.
I'm sorry to wake you, sir.
What is it?
Starfleet urgently requests any data we have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
What?
Well apparently, they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
Signal Starfleet that, we have no idea location Enterprise.
Sir?
You have hearing problems, mister?
No, sir.
Klingon blood.
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
This is the first evidence which corroborates our theory.
Now we go to Starfleet.
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
All uniforms?
Take those out.
Continue scanning.
Nothing, sir.
Clear, sir.
Coming through.
Coming through.
Computer well seven clear.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Okay, let's see what we got.
Nothing.
Nothing so far.
Sir!
Sir!
I think we've been had.
No, you weren't, Doctor.
Get off at the first level.
Follow the gang into the mine.
They don't take girls.
You are Crewman Dax?
Yes, Commander.
What is the problem?
Perhaps you know Russian epic of Cinderella?
If shoe fits, wear it.
Mr. Chekov.
Watch me.
What kind of creature is this?
Last night, you two were...
Don't remind me.
Get in.
Come on.
We don't have a lot of time.
Hurry.
Up there.
Come on, climb.
Here.
You'll need these.
Quickly!
Stay close.
There they are.
They're emerging from the beaming shield.
Mr. Scott, start your engines.
Aye, aye, sir.
Mr. Chekov, set course for Rura Penthe.
Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe is deep inside the Klingon frontier.
If we are discovered...
Quite correct, Mr. Chekov.
What is required now is a feat of linguistic legerdemain and a degree of intrepidity before the Captain and Dr McCoy freeze to death.
Leave me.
I'm finished.
No!
Bones, I'm wearing a viridium patch on my back.
Spock slapped it there just before we went on Gorkon's ship.
Why, that cunning little Vulcan.
Come on.
We're in the clear.
Now that we're outside the shield, they'll be able to locate us two sectors away.
If they're even looking for us.
This is listening post Morska.
What ship is that?
What ship is that?
Over.
What ship is that?
Over.
We must respond personally.
A universal translator would be recognized.
What ship is that?
Over.
What ship is that?
Over.
We am thy freighter Ursva.
Six weeks out of
Kronos port.
Over.
What is your destination?
Over.
What is your destination?
Over
What is your destination?
Over.
What is your destination?
Over.
Rura Penthe.
We is condemning food,
things and supplies.
Don't catch any bugs!
Would you mind explaining that little trick you do?
I'm a chameloid.
I've heard about you.
Shapeshifters.
I thought you were mythical.
Give a girl a chance, Captain.
It takes a lot of effort.
I don't doubt it.
Stop me if I'm wrong, but do we have any way of knowing whether this is the real you?
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.
We're outside the shield.
Now it's your turn, Captain.
If you say so.
Are you crazy?
She didn't need our help getting anywhere.
Where'd you get these convenient clothes?
Don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue.
It's to let them know where we are.
Ask her what she's getting in return.
A full pardon, which doesn't cover this.
An accident wasn't good enough.
Come on, Spock.
Good enough for one.
Two would have looked suspicious.
Killed while attempting escape.
Now that's convincing for both.
Surprise!
Your friends are late.
They'll be along.
I can't believe I kissed you.
Must have been your lifelong ambition.
Isn't it about time you became something else?
I like it here.
Well, well, well.
What took you so long?
Kill him.
He's the one.
Not me, you idiot.
Him!
No witnesses.
Killed while trying to escape.
Damn clever, if you ask me.
It's a classic.
That's what he wanted.
Who?
Who wanted us killed?
Since you're all going to die anyway, why not tell you?
His name is...
Damn it to hell!
Of all the...
Son of a...
Couldn't you have waited two seconds?
Captain?
He was just about to explain the whole thing.
You want to go back?
Absolutely not!
It's cold.
This is the Bridge.
We are still in Klingon space.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
They were beamed aboard, a Federation starship.
Escaped.
Escaped.
Kirk cannot know the location of the peace conference.
Are you sure?
Will you take that chance?
Helmsman!
Sir.
Make course to intercept Enterprise.
Yes Sir.
The Klingons have a new weapon, a bird-of-prey that can fire when cloaked.
She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
So that's it.
Not entirely.
I have reason to believe that Gorkon's murderers are aboard this vessel.
I have a thought about that.
Has the peace conference begun?
Who knows?
They're keeping the location secret.
There's always something.
Captain!
Mr. Spock!
I found the missing uniforms with the Klingon blood on them.
But the uniforms belong to these two men,
Burke and Samno.
Not anymore.
Phaser on stun at close range.
First rule of assassination, kill the assassins.
Now we're back to square one.
Can I talk to you?
I wonder why they weren't vaporized.
It would set off the alarm.
It's possible.
Now hear this.
Now hear this.
Court reporter to sickbay.
Code Blue.
Urgent.
Statements to be taken at once from yeomen Burke and Samno.
Repeat.
Court reporter to sickbay.
Code Blue.
Urgent.
Statements to be taken.
Repeat.
Statements to be taken from yeomen Burke and Samno.
You have to shoot.
If you are logical, you have to shoot.
I do not want to.
What you want is irrelevant.
What you've chosen is at hand.
I'd just as soon you didn't.
The operation is over.
I did not fire.
You cannot prove anything.
Yes, I can.
At my trial, my personal log was used against me.
How long did you wait outside my quarters before I noticed you?
You knew?
I tried to tell you, but you would not listen.
Neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant.
There were things I tried to tell you about having faith.
You have betrayed the Federation.
All of you.
And what do you think you've been doing?
Saving Starfleet.
Klingons cannot be trusted.
Sir.
You said so yourself.
They killed your son.
Did you not wish Gorkon dead?
Let them die, you said.
Did I misinterpret you?
And you were right.
They conspired with us to assassinate their own chancellor.
How trustworthy can they be?
Klingons and Federation members conspiring together?
Who is us?
Everyone who stands to lose from peace.
Names, Lieutenant.
My comrades will make certain all your ship-to-shore transmissions are jammed.
Names, Lieutenant.
I do not remember.
A lie?
A choice.
Spock?
Admiral Cartwright.
From Starfleet?
Who else?
General...
General...
Chang.
Chang.
Who else?
Romulan...
Romulan...
Ambassador...
Ambassador...
Nanclus.
Nanclus.
Where is the peace conference?
Where is the peace conference?
She does not know.
Then we're dead.
I've been dead before.
Contact Excelsior.
She'll have the coordinates.
I've already got him, sir.
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
Sulu!
You realize that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations.
I'm sorry, Captain.
Your message is breaking up.
Bless you, Sulu.
Where is the peace conference?
They're going to attempt another assassination.
The conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border.
I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
I'm afraid we're gonna need more than that.
There's a bird-of-prey on the lookout for us, and she can fire while cloaked.
Surely not.
Hold on.
How many of those things are there?
Come on, Lieutenant.
Just the prototype.
You hear that?
I'm getting underway now, but we're now in Alpha Quadrant.
The chances of our reaching the conference in time are slim.
When does this conference start?
According to my information, today.
Thank you, Captain Sulu.
Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
Spock?
I prefer it dark.
Dining on ashes?
You were right.
It was arrogant presumption on my part that got us into this situation.
You and the doctor might have been killed.
The night is young.
You said it yourself.
It was logical.
Peace is worth a few personal risks.
You're a great one for logic.
I'm a great one for rushing in where angels fear to tread.
We're both extremists.
Reality is probably somewhere in between.
I couldn't get past the death of my son.
I was prejudiced by her accomplishments as a Vulcan.
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was.
Is it possible that we two, you and I, have grown so old and so inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?
Would that constitute a joke?
Don't crucify yourself.
It wasn't your fault.
I was responsible.
For no actions but your own.
That is not what you said at your trial.
That was as captain of the ship.
Human beings...
But, Captain, we both know that I am not human.
Spock, you want to know something?
Everybody's human.
I find that remark insulting.
Come on.
I need you.
Madam Chancellor, members of the Diplomatic Corps, honored guests,
the United Federation of Planets welcomes you to Camp Khitomer.
She's out here somewhere.
But if she is cloaked...
Then all we have is a neutron radiation surge, and by the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes.
209.
206.
203.
Close enough to beam down?
Not yet, Captain.
In two minutes.
158.
Go to impulse power for Khitomer orbit.
Aye, sir.
Let us redefine progress to mean that just because we can do a thing, it does not necessarily follow that we must do that thing.
Uhura?
Nothing, Captain.
If she's here, she's rigged for silent running.
Coming up on transporter range in 57 seconds.
Transporter Room, stand by to beam down.
53... 48 seconds.
44...
I can see you, Kirk.
Chang.
Can you see me?
Now, be honest, Captain.
Warrior to warrior, you do prefer it this way, don't you?
As it was meant to be.
No peace in our time.
Once more unto the breach, dear friends.
This is fun.
Reverse engines.
All astern.
One and a half impulse power.
Back off!
Back off!
What's she doing?
What's she waiting for?
Probably attempting to ascertain why we are reversing, wondering whether we detect her.
Incoming!
In range?
Not yet, sir.
Come on.
Come on.
She'll fly apart.
Fly her apart, then!
Many speculated, about my father's motives.
There were those who said he was an idealist.
Others said he had no choice.
If Praxis had not exploded, then quite possibly his idealism would not have found expression.
We are a proud race, and we are here because we intend to go on being proud.
Go to auxiliary power!
Auxiliary circuits destroyed, Captain.
Tickle us, do we not laugh?
Prick us, do we not bleed?
Wrong us, shall we not revenge?
Gas.
Gas, Captain.
Under impulse power, she expends fuel like any other vessel.
We call it plasma, but whatever the Klingon designation, it is merely ionized gas.
Well, what about all of that equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
Well, the thing's gotta have a tailpipe.
Doctor, would you care to assist me in performing surgery on a torpedo?
Fascinating.
Hard to starboard!
The proposed agenda is as follows.
The total evacuation of Kronos has been calculated within the 50-Earth-year time span.
Phase one, preparation for evacuation.
Come on, reach up!
Captain!
She's packing quite a wallop!
Shields weakening!
Shields up.
All right.
Now we've given them something else to shoot at.
Aye, sir.
The game's afoot, huh?
Excelsior's been hit.
Our revels now are ended, Kirk.
Cry Havoc!
And let slip the dogs of war.
Bones!
Where's my torpedo?
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed.
Emergency power!
Gravity control down!
Shields collapsing!
The key, please, Doctor.
Time is short.
The hull has been compromised.
I wonder how bad?
Connect echobars.
To discuss the report on phase two.
Alter circuit A. Sensor.
I propose that we commence with the minutes of the preparation.
I am constant as the northern star.
I'd give real money if he'd shut up.
Plate, please.
Plate.
And assimilation will consume...
We've got a heartbeat.
The Klingon empire, the ecological...
Key, please.
Key.
Where's that damn torpedo?
She's ready, Jim.
Lock and load.
Fire.
To be, or not to be.
Target that explosion and fire.
Fire.
As I imagine this work will occupy us throughout most of the week, it would be my hope that the delegation could return to their capitals to implement the provisions of phase one, no later than the first of next month.
Scotty.
As you know, time is of the essence.
Out of the way!
Out of the way!
Mr. President!
Mr. President!
Mr. President!
Mr. President!
Kirk, Enterprise.
Protect the Chancellor!
Arrest those men!
Arrest yourself.
We've got a full confession.
Cartwright, just a minute.
What's happened?
What's the meaning of all of this?
It's about the future, Madam Chancellor.
Some people think the future means the end of history.
Well, we haven't run out of history quite yet.
Your father called the future, the undiscovered country.
People can be very frightened of change.
You've restored my father's faith.
And you've restored my son's.
Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
And the good news is, they're not going to prosecute.
They might as well have prosecuted me.
I felt like Lieutenant Valeris.
Well, they don't arrest people for having feelings.
And it's a good thing, too.
If they did, we'd all have to turn ourselves in.
Captain Kirk.
Captain Sulu.
As much to the crew of the Enterprise, I owe you my thanks.
Nice to see you in action one more time, Captain Kirk.
Take care.
By God, that's a big ship.
Not so big as her captain, I think.
So... this is goodbye.
I think it's about time we got underway ourselves.
Captain, I have orders from Starfleet Command.
We're to put back to spacedock immediately, to be decommissioned.
If I were human,
I believe my response would be,
Go to hell.
If I were human.
Course heading, Captain?
Second star to the right, and straight on till morning.
Captain's Log, Stardate 9529.1.
This is the final cruise of the Starship Enterprise under my command.
This ship and her history will shortly become the care of another crew.
To them and their posterity will we commit our future.
They will continue the voyages we have begun, and journey to all the undiscovered countries, boldly going where no man.
Where no one, as gone before.
By LESAIGNEUR Sync corrections August 2016
Stardate 9521.6.
Captain's Log, U.S.S. Excelsior.
Hikaru Sulu commanding.
After three years,
I've concluded my first assignment as master of this vessel, cataloguing gaseous planetary anomalies in Beta Quadrant.
We're heading home under full impulse power.
I am pleased to report that ship and crew have functioned well.
According to this, we've completed our survey of the entire sector.
I have an energy wave at 240 degrees mark 6 port, sir.
Visual.
My God.
Shields.
Shields!
She's not answering her helm.
Starboard thruster.
Turn her into the wave.
Aye.
Quarter impulse power.
Damage report.
Checking all systems, Captain.
Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
Negative, sir.
The subspace shockwave originated at bearing 3-2-3 mark 75.
Location...
It's Praxis, sir.
It's a Klingon moon.
Praxis is their key energy production facility.
Send to Klingon High Command.
"This is Excelsior, a Federation starship.
"We have monitored a large explosion in your sector.
"Do you require assistance?"
- Aye, sir.
- Mr Valtane, any more data?
Yes, sir.
I've confirmed the location of Praxis, but...
What is it?
I cannot confirm the existence of Praxis.
Onscreen.
Magnify.
Computer enhancement.
- Praxis?
- What's left of it, sir.
Captain, I'm getting a message from Praxis.
Let's have it.
This is Brigadier Kerla speaking for the High Command.
There has been an incident on Praxis.
However, everything is under control.
We have no need for assistance.
Obey treaty stipulations and remain outside the neutral zone.
This transmission ends now.
"An incident"?
- Do we report this, sir?
- Are you kidding?
What are we doing here?
Maybe they're throwing us a retirement party.
- That suits me.
I just bought a boat.
- This had better be good.
I'm supposed to be chairing a seminar at the Academy.
Captain, isn't this just for top brass?
If we're all here, where's Sulu?
Captain Sulu.
On assignment.
Where's Spock?
This briefing is classified.
Ladies and gentlemen, the CinC.
As you were.
To break this information down succinctly, the Klingon Empire has roughly 50 years of life left to it.
For full details, I'm turning this briefing over to the Federation's special envoy.
Good morning.
Two months ago, a Federation starship monitored an explosion on the Klingon moon Praxis.
We believe it was caused by over-mining and insufficient safety precautions.
The moon's decimation means the deadly pollution of their ozone.
They will have depleted their supply of oxygen in approximately 50 Earth years.
Due to their enormous military budget, the Klingon economy does not have the resources with which to combat this catastrophe.
Last month, at the behest of the Vulcan ambassador,
I opened a dialogue with Gorkon, Chancellor of the Klingon High Council.
He proposes to commence negotiations at once.
Negotiations for what?
The dismantling of our space stations and starbases along the neutral zone, an end to almost 70 years of unremitting hostility, which the Klingons can no longer afford.
Bill, are we talking about mothballing the Starfleet?
Well, I'm sure that our exploration and scientific programmes
- would be unaffected, Captain, but...
- I must protest.
To offer Klingons safe haven within Federation space is suicide.
Klingons would become the alien trash of the galaxy, and if we dismantle the fleet, we'd be defenceless before an aggressive species with a foothold on our territory.
The opportunity here is to bring them to their knees.
Then we'll be in a far better position to dictate terms.
Sir?
Captain Kirk.
The Klingons have never been trustworthy.
I'm forced to agree with Admiral Cartwright.
This is a terrifying idea.
It is imperative that we act now to support the Gorkon initiative lest more conservative elements persuade his empire that it is better to attempt a military solution and die fighting.
You, Captain Kirk, are to be our first olive branch.
We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon vessel which is bringing Chancellor Gorkon to Earth and to escort him safely through Federation space.
Me?
Well, there are Klingons who feel the same way about the peace treaty as yourself and Admiral Cartwright, but they'll think twice about attacking the Enterprise under your command.
I have personally vouched for you in this matter, Captain.
You have personally vouched?
You will extend Chancellor Gorkon full diplomatic courtesy, Captain Kirk.
But a full ambassador would be better equipped...
If there's no further business,
I wish you and your crew Godspeed.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
I remind you, this meeting is classified.
I don't know whether to congratulate you or not, Jim.
I wouldn't.
We volunteered?
There is an old Vulcan proverb, "Only Nixon could go to China. "
How could you vouch for me?
That's arrogant presumption.
My father requested that I open negotiations...
I know your father's the Vulcan ambassador, for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this.
They're animals.
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here.
Don't believe them.
Don't trust them.
- They are dying.
- Let them die.
Has it occurred to you that this crew is due to stand down in three months?
We've done our bit for king and country.
You should have trusted me.
Control, this is SD-103, approach to spacedock.
Over.
SD-103, you are clear to deliver Captain Kirk and party to NCC-1701 Alpha.
Over.
Captain on the Bridge.
- As you were, Lieutenant...
- Valeris, sir.
We were told that you needed a helmsman, so I volunteered.
Lieutenant, it is agreeable to see you again.
Lieutenant was the first Vulcan to be graduated
- at the top of her class at the academy.
- You must be very proud.
I don't believe so, sir.
She's a Vulcan, all right.
Let's get this over with.
Departure stations.
- Scotty.
- Aye, sir?
Did you find the engine room?
Right where I left it, sir.
Standby.
Uhura, get me the dockmaster.
Control tower reading, sir.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
This is Control, Enterprise.
Permission to depart granted.
Thirty seconds for port gates.
Clear all moorings.
Awaiting port gates from this mark.
All moorings clear.
Aft thrusters.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
One-quarter impulse power.
Captain, may I remind you that regulations specify thrusters only while in spacedock?
Jim?
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
Aye, sir.
Captain's Log, Stardate 9522.6.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I could never forgive them for the death of my boy.
It seems to me our mission to escort the Chancellor of the Klingon High Council to a peace summit is problematic at best.
Spock says this could be an historic occasion, and I'd like to believe him, but how on earth can history get past people like me?
Sorry.
You could have knocked.
We are almost at the rendezvous, sir.
I thought that you would like to know.
Right.
Permission to speak freely, sir.
It is an honour to serve with you.
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant.
I've always wanted to try that, sir.
You've done well, Valeris.
As your sponsor at the academy,
I have followed your career with satisfaction, and as a Vulcan, you've exceeded my expectations.
I do not understand this representation.
It is a depiction from ancient Earth mythology, the expulsion from Paradise.
Why keep it in your quarters?
It is a reminder to me that all things end.
It is of endings that I wish to speak.
Sir, I address you as a kindred intellect.
Do you not recognise that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
History is replete with turning points, Lieutenant.
- You must have faith.
- Faith?
That the universe will unfold as it should.
- But is that logical?
Surely we must...
- Logic, logic and logic.
Logic is the beginning of wisdom, Valeris, not the end.
This will be my final voyage onboard this vessel as a member of her crew.
Nature abhors a vacuum.
I intend you to replace me.
I could only succeed you, sir.
Now hear this.
All officers to the Bridge.
Klingon battle cruiser off the port bow.
All officers to the Bridge.
Captain on the Bridge.
Shall we raise our shields, Captain?
Never been this close.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
- Uhura, hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Right standard rudder.
Bring us alongside.
Right standard rudder.
Z plus 5 degrees.
Channel is open, Captain.
This is the Starship Enterprise,
Captain James T. Kirk commanding.
This is Kronos One.
I am Chancellor Gorkon.
Chancellor, we've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting on Earth.
Thank you, Captain.
Would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard the Enterprise with my officers, as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We would be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
I shall look forward to that.
- Well, I hope you're happy.
- Captain, there is a supply of Romulan ale aboard.
It might make the evening pass more smoothly.
Officer thinking, Lieutenant.
Guess who's coming to dinner.
Energise.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- Captain Kirk.
May I present Captain Spock, whom I believe you know.
Captain, face to face at last.
- You have my thanks.
- Chancellor.
Gentlemen, this is my daughter Azetbur,
my military adviser, Brigadier Kerla, and this is General Chang, my chief of staff.
I have so wanted to meet you, Captain.
I'm not sure how to take that.
Sincere admiration, Kirk.
From one warrior to another.
Right.
This way.
I think you might enjoy a brief tour.
- They all look alike.
- What about that smell?
You know only top-of-the-line models can even talk...
You men have work?
- Yes, ma'am.
- Yes, ma'am.
Then snap to it.
I offer a toast.
"The undiscover'd country,"
the future.
- "The undiscover'd country. " - "The undiscover'd country. "
Hamlet, Act III, Scene 1.
You've not experienced Shakespeare until you have read him in the original Klingon.
Captain Kirk, I thought Romulan ale was illegal.
One of the advantages of being 1,000 light-years from Federation Headquarters.
To you, Chancellor Gorkon, one of the architects of our future.
- Chancellor.
- Chancellor.
Perhaps we are looking at something of that future here.
Tell me, Captain Kirk, would you be willing to give up Starfleet?
I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace.
Far be it for me to dispute my first officer, but Starfleet has always been at the fore...
Captain, there's no need to mince words.
In space, all warriors are cold warriors.
General, are you fond of
Shakespeare?
We do believe all planets have a sovereign claim to inalienable human rights.
Inalien?
If you could only hear yourselves.
"Human rights. "
Why, the very name is racist.
The Federation is no more than a "Homo Sapiens Only" club.
Present company excepted, of course.
In any case, we know where this is leading.
- The annihilation of our culture.
- That's not true.
- No?
- No.
"To be, or not to be. "
That is the question which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk.
- We need breathing room.
- Earth, Hitler, 1938.
I beg your pardon?
Well...
I see we have a long way to go.
We must do this again sometime.
You don't trust me, do you?
I don't blame you.
If there is to be a brave new world, our generation is going to have the hardest time living in it.
Captain Spock.
Chancellor.
- Madam.
- Captain.
Well, most kind.
"Parting is such sweet sorrow," Captain.
Have we not "heard the chimes at midnight"?
Thank God.
Did you see the way they ate?
Terrible table manners.
I doubt that our own behaviour will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy.
I'm going to sleep this off.
Please let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight.
I'm going to go find a pot of black coffee.
The Enterprise hosted Chancellor Gorkon and company to dinner last night.
Our manners weren't exactly Emily Post.
Note to the galley,
Romulan ale no longer to be served at diplomatic functions.
Captain Kirk, will you please join me on the Bridge?
Captain Kirk?
- Captain.
- What is it?
I find this curious.
Spock, I'm really tired.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
Where?
Strangely enough, it appears to be emanating from us.
The Enterprise?
Valeris, do you know anything about a radiation surge?
Sir?
Chekov?
Only the size of my head.
I know what you mean.
- What's happened?
- We have fired on the Chancellor's ship.
Torpedo Room, please confirm.
Have we fired?
...0-6...
- Uhura, monitor.
- Aye, sir.
Direct hit.
Confirmed, sir.
We've lost gravity!
We are betrayed!
This is the Bridge.
Do you read?
Do you read?
Torpedo bay, did we fire those torpedoes?
Negative, Captain.
According to inventory, we're still fully loaded.
Find Chang.
Unable to confirm or deny firing of two photon torpedoes.
- Hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Kronos One, this is Enterprise.
Do you read?
Over.
Repeat.
Kronos One...
It's very hard to make out, Captain.
There's been some weapons firing and a lot of shouting.
She is still listing.
She's spinning out of control.
Restoring auxiliary gravity.
Have you not a shred of decency in you, Kirk?
We come in peace, and you blatantly defile that peace.
For that, I shall blow you out of the stars.
- We haven't fired.
- Captain.
According to our databanks, we have, twice.
Captain, they're coming about.
- They're preparing to fire.
- Shields up, Captain?
- Captain, our shields.
- Shields up, Captain?
- Signal our surrender.
- Captain?
We surrender!
- This is Enterprise.
We surrender.
- If they fire at us
- with our shields down...
- I repeat.
- We surrender.
- ... we will not be able to respond.
Repeat.
Enterprise surrenders.
- Are we firing torpedoes?
- I wish I knew.
Well, it sure looks like it.
I'm going aboard.
Spock, you have the conn.
I am responsible for involving you in this.
I will go.
No, I'll go.
You'll be responsible for getting me out of this.
We'll not be the instigators of full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
I'm going, too.
They may need a doctor.
- Perhaps you're right.
- Uhura, tell them we're coming, and tell them we're unarmed.
Aye, sir.
Have you lost your mind?
I give you my word, I don't understand what has happened.
We're here to help.
Follow me.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- My God.
- What has happened here?
- You dare to feign ignorance?
- What happened?
- With a direct torpedo hit, you crippled our entire gravitational field, and two of your Starfleet crew beamed aboard wearing magnetic boots and did this.
Aren't you carrying a surgeon?
We were until this disgrace.
Well, then for God sakes, man, let me help.
I've got a pulse.
We can move him.
I'm gonna need some light.
Can we get him up on this table?
Hold him.
Hold him while I stabilise him.
I said hold him.
Sweet Jesus.
- Can you...
- Jim, I don't even know his anatomy.
- His wounds are not closing.
- He's killing him!
He's gone into some kind of damned arrest.
Come on, damn it!
Come on!
He's not responding.
Don't let it end this way, Captain.
Under article number 184 of your interstellar law,
I'm placing you under arrest.
You are charged with assassinating our Chancellor of the High Council.
He tried to save him.
They've been arrested.
Mr Spock, we've got to do something.
I assume command of this ship as of 0230 hours.
Commander Uhura, please notify Starfleet Headquarters.
Tell them precisely what has taken place
- and request instructions.
- Aye, sir.
We cannot allow them to be taken back to Kronos as prisoners.
What do you suggest, Lieutenant?
Opening fire will not retrieve them, and an armed conflict is precisely what the Captain wished to avoid.
We will be able to follow the Captain's movements.
- How did you achieve this, sir?
- Time is precious, Lieutenant.
We must endeavour to piece together what happened here tonight.
According to our databank, this ship fired those torpedoes.
No way.
I sympathise, Mr Scott, but we need evidence.
Please accompany me.
And if we cannot piece together what happened?
- What then, sir?
- In that case, Mr Chekov, it resides in the purview of the diplomats.
The Chancellor of the High Council is dead!
The result of an unprovoked attack while he travelled to see you under a flag of truce, on a mission of peace.
Captain Kirk was legally arrested for the crime.
May I remind you that he and Dr McCoy boarded Kronos One of their own free will?
None of these facts are in dispute, Mr President.
I have ordered a full-scale investigation.
- In the meantime...
- In the meantime, we expect the Federation to abide by the articles of interstellar law, which you claim to cherish.
Kirk and Dr McCoy will stand trial for the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon.
Out of the question.
Ambassador Sarek, there must be some way to extradite these men.
Mr President, I share a measure of personal responsibility in this matter, but I am obliged to confirm my esteemed colleague's legal interpretation.
What is the position of the Romulan government,
Ambassador Nanclus?
I must concur with my colleagues.
But you can't possibly believe that James Kirk assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council.
Mr President, I don't know what to believe.
I'm waiting for your answer, sir.
This president is not above the law.
Report back at once.
Do you copy?
At once.
Enterprise to report back on the double.
Do you read?
At once.
We're to report back at once.
We cannot abandon Captain Kirk and Dr McCoy.
Of course not.
Four hundred years ago on the planet Earth, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by automation flung their wooden shoes called "sabot" into the machines to stop them.
Hence the word "sabotage. "
We are experiencing technical malfunction.
All backup systems inoperative.
Excellent.
I mean, too bad.
Mr President,
I've been named Chancellor by the High Council in my father's place.
Madam Chancellor, you have my sincerest condolences on your recent loss.
I want to assure you that this shameful deed will not...
Mr President, let us come to the point.
You want this conference to go forward, and so did my father.
I will attend in one week on one condition.
We will not extradite the prisoners, and you will make no attempt to rescue them in a military operation.
We would consider any such attempt an act of war.
We hope you'll be our guest here on Earth.
After recent events, you will understand if I say I prefer a neutral site, and in the interests of security, let us keep the location secret for now.
As you wish, Madam Chancellor.
Attack them now, while we still can!
Attack or be slaves in their world.
We can take whole by force, what they propose to divide.
War is obsolete, General, as we are in danger of becoming.
Better to die on our feet than live on our knees.
That wasn't what my father wanted.
Your father was killed for what he wanted.
The peace process will go forward.
Kirk...
Kirk will pay for my father's death.
- Kirk!
Kirk!
- Kirk!
Kirk!
- Kirk!
Kirk!
Kirk!
Kirk!
- Kirk!
Kirk!
Kirk!
Kirk!
It's a damn show trial.
- Kirk!
Kirk!
- Kirk!
Kirk!
The Enterprise fired on Kronos One without provocation.
The Chancellor and his advisers having been lulled into a false sense of security by an invitation to a state dinner aboard Captain Kirk's vessel at precisely 1930 hours that same evening.
Call your first witness.
After the first shot, we lost our gravitational field.
I found myself weightless and unable to function.
Then two Starfleet crewmen came walking towards me.
But perhaps they merely wore Starfleet uniforms.
That remark is purely speculative.
I move that it be stricken.
Colonel Worf, we are interested in facts, not theories.
If the gravitational unit was not functioning, how could these men be walking?
They appeared to be wearing magnetic boots.
Gravity boots.
Dr McCoy, would you be so good as to tell me, what is your current medical status?
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
You have a singular wit, Doctor.
For 27 years, I've been ship surgeon aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.
In three months, I stand down.
You know, I believe that you consumed a rather generous amount of Romulan ale in the officers' mess on the night in question.
Am I right, Doctor?
- Objection!
- Sustained.
We all did.
All of us.
- That doesn't mean...
- Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
- Barely.
- Now be careful, Doctor.
Have you ever, in your past, saved patients as barely alive as he?
I didn't have the medical knowledge I needed for Klingon anatomy.
- I see.
- You were there.
You say you are due for retirement.
May I ask, do your hands shake?
- Objection!
- I was nervous.
No.
You were incompetent.
You were incompetent!
Whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink,
- the court will have to determine.
- My God, man!
I tried to save him!
I tried to save him.
I was desperate to save him.
He was the last best hope in the universe for peace.
The witness is excused.
There we have it, citizens.
We have finally established the particulars of the crime, and now we come to the architect of this tragic affair,
James Tiberius Kirk.
What would your favourite author say, Captain?
"Let us sit upon the ground
"and tell sad stories of the death of kings. "
Tell us your sad story, Kirk.
Tell us that you planned to take revenge for the death of your son.
- That's not true.
- Objection!
Captain Kirk has not been identified as the assassin.
Sustained.
I offer into the record this excerpt from the Captain's personal log.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I have never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Again.
Again!
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I have never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Are those your words?
Those words were spoken by me.
Objection!
My client's political views are not on trial here.
On the contrary!
Captain Kirk's views and motives are indeed at the very heart of the matter.
This officer's record shows him to be an insubordinate, unprincipled, career-minded opportunist, with a history of violating the chain of command whenever it suited him!
Continue.
Indeed, the record shows that Captain Kirk once held the rank of Admiral, and that Admiral Kirk was broken for taking matters into his own hands in defiance of regulations of the law.
Do you deny being demoted for these charges?
Don't wait for the translation!
Answer me now!
I cannot deny it.
- You were demoted?
- Yes.
- For insubordination?
- On occasion, I have disobeyed orders.
And were you obeying or disobeying orders when you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?
I didn't know about the assassination until we boarded the ship.
You still deny the Enterprise fired on Kronos One?
- Well...
- Your Honours, please!
And you still deny your men beamed aboard and shot the Chancellor?
Objection!
I cannot confirm or deny actions I did not witness.
Captain Kirk, are you aware that as the captain of a starship, you are required to be responsible for the actions of your men?
I am.
And if it should be proved that members of your crew did, in fact, carry out such an assassination...
Jim, they're setting us up.
Your Honours...
Do not answer!
Captain Kirk, you will answer the question.
As captain,
I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
Your Honours, the State rests.
Send to Commander Enterprise.
"We stand ready to assist you.
Captain Sulu, U.S.S. Excelsior. "
It is the determination of this court that the prisoners are guilty as charged.
I wish to note for the record that the evidence against my clients is entirely circumstantial.
I beg the court to consider this when pronouncing its sentence.
So noted.
Captain James T. Kirk, Dr Leonard McCoy, in the interest of fostering amity for the forthcoming peace talks, the sentence of death is commuted.
It is the judgement of this court that, without possibility of reprieve or parole, you be taken from this place to the dilithium mines on the penal asteroid of Rura Penthe, there to spend the rest of your natural lives.
Rura Penthe?
Known throughout the galaxy as the aliens' graveyard.
Better to kill them now and get it over with.
Lieutenant, the torpedo hit once again, please.
Hold.
It is Enterprise.
- We fired.
- That is not possible.
All weapons visually accounted for, sir.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.
What exactly does that mean?
It means that if we cannot have fired those torpedoes, someone else did.
Well, they did not fire on themselves, and there were no other ships present.
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
Not from us!
A neutron surge that big could only be produced by another ship.
Kronos One?
Too far away.
Very near us.
Possibly beneath us.
If there were a ship beneath us, the Klingons would have seen her.
Would they?
- A bird-of-prey.
- A bird-of-prey.
Cloaked?
A bird-of-prey cannot fire when she's cloaked.
All things being equal, Mr Scott, I would agree.
However, things are not equal.
This one can.
We must inform Starfleet Command.
Inform them of what, a new weapon that is invisible?
Raving lunatics, that's what they'll call us.
They'll say that we're so desperate to exonerate the Captain that we'll say anything.
And they would be correct.
We have no evidence, only a theory which happens to fit the facts.
Assuming you're right, Mr Spock, why would they fire on their own president?
Indeed.
This ship will be searched from bow to stern.
Lieutenant Valeris, you'll be in charge.
- Aye, sir.
- I do not understand.
If there was a ship underneath us, surely the assassins beamed aboard from that vessel, not Enterprise.
You're forgetting something, Mr Chekov.
According to our databanks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
If we did, the killers are here.
If we did not, whoever altered the databanks is here.
In either case, what we are looking for is here.
What are we looking for, sir?
Lieutenant?
Two pairs of gravity boots.
This is the gulag Rura Penthe.
There is no stockade, no guard tower, no electronic frontier.
Only a magnetic shield prevents beaming.
Punishment means exile from prison to the surface.
On the surface, nothing can survive.
Work well and you will be treated well.
Work badly and you will die.
Oh, my God.
The universal translator's been confiscated.
I'm sorry?
He's definitely on about something, Jim.
If this is your spot, we'll move on.
He wants your obedience to the brotherhood of aliens.
- He's got it.
- And your coat.
I'm afraid not.
Besides, it wouldn't fit.
Thanks.
This will help keep you warm.
I'm Martia.
You're Kirk and McCoy, I presume.
How'd you know that?
We don't get many presidential assassins.
- We didn't kill Gorkon.
- Of course not,
- but there is a reward for your death.
- It figures.
We've been set up all along.
Somebody up there wants you out of the way.
- Nothing in here.
- Nothing here.
- Any progress?
- None.
We have a crew of 300 turning their own quarters inside out, but the killers may still be among them.
Surely they have disposed of these boots by now.
Would it not have been logical to have left them on Gorkon's ship?
Even logic must give way to physics.
Gravity had not been restored by the time they escaped.
Without the boots, they would have floated off the Klingon transporter pads.
Why not simply vapourize them?
Like this?
At ease.
As you know, Commander Chekov, no one can fire an unauthorised phaser aboard a starship.
Suppose when they returned, they threw the boots into the refuse.
I'm having the refuse searched.
If my surmise is correct, those boots will cling to the killers' necks like a pair of Tiberian bats.
They could not make their escape without them, nor can they simply throw them out the window for all to see.
- Those boots are here somewhere.
- Did someone fire off a phaser?
It's all right.
It's nothing.
It's nothing.
Mr Spock, Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
- Who fired that...
- Mr Scott.
I understand you're having difficulty with the warp drive.
How much time do you require for repair?
There's nothing wrong with the bloody thing.
Mr Scott, if we return to spacedock, the assassins will surely find a way to dispose of their incriminating footwear, and we will never see the Captain or Dr McCoy alive again.
- It could take weeks, sir.
- Thank you, Mr Scott.
Valeris, please inform Starfleet Command
- our warp drive is inoperative.
- A lie?
An error.
You understand we have lost all contact with the Captain and Dr McCoy.
Yes.
At the moment, they're surrounded by a magnetic shield.
However, if I know the Captain, by this time, he is deep into planning his escape.
You got him, Jim!
You got him where you want him!
- You all right, Jim?
- I think so.
- They'll respect you now.
- That's a comfort.
- I was lucky that thing had knees.
- That was not his knee.
Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Anything you want to tell me?
Bones, why don't you see what you can do for him?
Let him know we're not holding a grudge.
Suppose he's holding a grudge?
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
- Do you want to get out of here?
- There's gotta be a way.
Three months before retirement.
What a way to finish.
- We're not finished.
- No?
Speak for yourself.
One day, one night, Kobayashi Maru.
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
I believe that was the general idea that I was trying to convey.
I don't mean this future.
- What is this, multiple choice?
- Some people are afraid of what might happen.
I was terrified.
What terrified you, specifically?
No more neutral zone.
I was used to hating Klingons.
It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word.
Spock was right.
Try not to be too hard on yourself.
We all felt exactly the same.
No.
Somebody felt a lot worse.
I'm beginning to understand why.
Well, if you've got any bright ideas, now's the time.
Time's the problem.
You and I are nothing.
But you heard the judge.
The peace conference is on again.
Whoever killed Gorkon is bound to attempt another assassination.
Unless we can get out of here.
Kirk, it's me, Martia.
Listen, no one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
- Except us.
- It is possible.
- I know how to get outside the shield.
- How do we fit in?
Getting outside the shield is easy, but after that, it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze.
Can you?
- It's possible.
- I can't make it alone, and you're likeliest candidate to come in this hellhole for months.
Candidate for what?
Go to lift seven in the morning for mining duty.
I'll see you there.
Don't disappoint me.
- What is it with you, anyway?
- Still think we're finished?
More than ever.
- I'm sorry to wake you, sir.
- What is it?
Starfleet urgently requests any data we have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
What?
Well, apparently, they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
Signal Starfleet that we have no idea location Enterprise.
Sir?
- You have hearing problems, mister?
- No, sir.
Klingon blood.
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
This is the first evidence which corroborates our theory.
Now we go to Starfleet.
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
All uniforms?
Take those out.
- Continue scanning.
- Nothing, sir.
Clear, sir.
Coming through.
Coming through.
Computer well seven clear.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Okay, let's see what we got.
Nothing.
Nothing so far.
Sir!
Sir!
- I think we've been had.
- No, you weren't, Doctor.
Get off at the first level.
Follow the gang into the mine.
They don't take girls.
You are Crewman Dax?
Yes, Commander.
What is the problem?
Perhaps you know Russian epic of Cinderella?
If shoe fits, wear it.
Mr Chekov.
Watch me.
What kind of creature is this?
Last night, you two were...
Don't remind me.
Get in.
Come on.
We don't have a lot of time.
Hurry.
Up there.
Come on, climb.
Here.
You'll need these.
Quickly!
Stay close.
There they are.
They're emerging from the beaming shield.
- Mr Scott, start your engines.
- Aye, aye, sir.
Mr Chekov, set course for Rura Penthe.
Mr Spock, Rura Penthe is deep inside the Klingon frontier.
- If we are discovered...
- Quite correct, Mr Chekov.
What is required now is a feat of linguistic legerdemain and a degree of intrepidity before the Captain and Dr McCoy freeze to death.
- Leave me.
I'm finished.
- No!
Bones, I'm wearing a viridium patch on my back.
Spock slapped it there just before we went on Gorkon's ship.
- Why, that cunning little Vulcan.
- Come on.
We're in the clear.
Now that we're outside the shield, they'll be able to locate us two sectors away.
If they're even looking for us.
This is listening post Morska.
What ship is that?
Over.
We must respond personally.
A universal translator would be recognised.
We am thy freighter Ursva.
Six weeks out of
Kronos.
What is your destination?
Over.
We is condemning food,
things and supplies.
Don't catch any bugs!
Would you mind explaining that little trick you do?
- I'm a chameloid.
- I've heard about you.
Shapeshifters.
- I thought you were mythical.
- Give a girl a chance, Captain.
- It takes a lot of effort.
- I don't doubt it.
Stop me if I'm wrong, but do we have any way of knowing whether this is the real you?
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.
We're outside the shield.
Now it's your turn, Captain.
If you say so.
Are you crazy?
She didn't need our help getting anywhere.
Where'd you get these convenient clothes?
Don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue.
It's to let them know where we are.
Ask her what she's getting in return.
A full pardon, which doesn't cover this.
An accident wasn't good enough.
Come on, Spock.
Good enough for one.
Two would have looked suspicious.
Killed while attempting escape.
Now that's convincing for both.
Surprise!
- Your friends are late.
- They'll be along.
- I can't believe I kissed you.
- Must have been your lifelong ambition.
Isn't it about time you became something else?
I like it here.
Well, well, well.
What took you so long?
- Kill him.
He's the one.
- Not me, you idiot.
Him!
- No witnesses.
- Killed while trying to escape.
- Damn clever, if you ask me.
- It's a classic.
- That's what he wanted.
- Who?
Who wanted us killed?
Since you're all going to die anyway, why not tell you?
His name is...
Damn it to hell!
Of all the...
Son of a...
- Couldn't you have waited two seconds?
- Captain?
He was just about to explain the whole thing.
You want to go back?
- Absolutely not!
- It's cold.
This is the Bridge.
We are still in Klingon space.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
They were beamed aboard a Federation starship.
I could trace...
Escaped.
Kirk cannot know the location of the peace conference.
Are you sure?
Will you take that chance?
Helmsman, make course to intercept Enterprise.
The Klingons have a new weapon, a bird-of-prey that can fire when cloaked.
- She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
- So that's it.
Not entirely.
I have reason to believe that Gorkon's murderers
- are aboard this vessel.
- I have a thought about that.
Has the peace conference begun?
Who knows?
They're keeping the location secret.
- There's always something.
- Captain!
Mr Spock!
I found the missing uniforms with the Klingon blood on them.
But the uniforms belong to these two men,
Burke and Samno.
Not any more.
Phaser on stun at close range.
First rule of assassination, kill the assassins.
- Now we're back to square one.
- Can I talk to you?
I wonder why they weren't vapourized.
It would set off the alarm.
It's possible.
Now hear this.
Now hear this.
Court reporter to sickbay.
Code Blue.
Urgent.
Statements to be taken at once from yeomen Burke and Samno.
Repeat.
Court reporter to sickbay.
Code Blue.
Urgent.
Statements to be taken.
Repeat.
Statements to be taken from yeomen Burke and Samno.
You have to shoot.
If you are logical, you have to shoot.
I do not want to.
What you want is irrelevant.
What you've chosen is at hand.
I'd just as soon you didn't.
The operation is over.
I did not fire.
You cannot prove anything.
Yes, I can.
At my trial, my personal log was used against me.
How long did you wait outside my quarters before I noticed you?
You knew?
I tried to tell you, but you would not listen.
Neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant.
There were things I tried to tell you about having faith.
You have betrayed the Federation.
All of you.
And what do you think you've been doing?
Saving Starfleet.
Klingons cannot be trusted.
Sir.
You said so yourself.
They killed your son.
Did you not wish Gorkon dead?
"Let them die," you said.
Did I misinterpret you?
And you were right.
They conspired with us to assassinate their own chancellor.
How trustworthy can they be?
Klingons and Federation members conspiring together?
Who is "us"?
Everyone who stands to lose from peace.
- Names, Lieutenant.
- My comrades will make certain all your ship-to-shore transmissions are jammed.
Names, Lieutenant.
I do not remember.
A lie?
A choice.
Spock?
Admiral Cartwright.
From Starfleet?
Who else?
- General...
- General...
- ...
Chang.
- ...
Chang.
Who else?
- Romulan...
- Romulan...
- ...
Ambassador...
- ...
Ambassador...
- ...
Nanclus.
- ...
Nanclus.
Where is the peace conference?
She does not know.
Then we're dead.
I've been dead before.
Contact Excelsior.
- She'll have the coordinates.
- I've already got him, sir.
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
Sulu!
You realise that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations.
I'm sorry, Captain.
Your message is breaking up.
Bless you, Sulu.
Where is the peace conference?
They're going to attempt another assassination.
The conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border.
I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
I'm afraid we're gonna need more than that.
There's a bird-of-prey on the lookout for us, and she can fire while cloaked.
Surely not.
Hold on.
How many of those things are there?
Come on, Lieutenant.
- Just the prototype.
- You hear that?
I'm getting underway now, but we're now in Alpha Quadrant.
The chances of our reaching the conference in time are slim.
When does this conference start?
According to my information, today.
Thank you, Captain Sulu.
Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
Spock?
I prefer it dark.
Dining on ashes?
You were right.
It was arrogant presumption on my part that got us into this situation.
You and the doctor might have been killed.
The night is young.
You said it yourself.
It was logical.
Peace is worth a few personal risks.
You're a great one for logic.
I'm a great one for rushing in where angels fear to tread.
We're both extremists.
Reality is probably somewhere in between.
I couldn't get past the death of my son.
I was prejudiced by her accomplishments as a Vulcan.
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was.
Is it possible that we two, you and I, have grown so old and so inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?
Would that constitute a joke?
Don't crucify yourself.
It wasn't your fault.
I was responsible.
- For no actions but your own.
- That is not what you said at your trial.
That was as captain of the ship.
Human beings...
But, Captain, we both know that I am not human.
Spock, you want to know something?
Everybody's human.
I find that remark insulting.
Come on.
I need you.
Madam Chancellor, members of the Diplomatic Corps, honoured guests,
the United Federation of Planets welcomes you to Camp Khitomer.
She's out here somewhere.
But if she is cloaked...
Then all we have is a neutron radiation surge, and by the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes.
209.
206.
203.
- Close enough to beam down?
- Not yet, Captain.
In two minutes. 158.
- Go to impulse power for Khitomer orbit.
- Aye, sir.
Let us redefine progress to mean that just because we can do a thing, it does not necessarily follow that we must do that thing.
- Uhura?
- Nothing, Captain.
If she's here, she's rigged for silent running.
Coming up on transporter range in 57 seconds.
Transporter Room, stand by to beam down.
...53 48 seconds.
...44...
I can see you, Kirk.
Chang.
Can you see me?
Now, be honest, Captain.
Warrior to warrior, you do prefer it this way, don't you?
As it was meant to be.
No peace in our time.
"Once more unto the breach, dear friends. "
- This is fun.
- Reverse engines.
All astern.
One and a half impulse power.
Back off!
Back off!
What's she doing?
What's she waiting for?
Probably attempting to ascertain why we are reversing, wondering whether we detect her.
Incoming!
- In range?
- Not yet, sir.
Come on.
Come on.
- She'll fly apart.
- Fly her apart, then!
Many speculated about my father's motives.
There were those who said he was an idealist.
Others said he had no choice.
If Praxis had not exploded, then quite possibly his idealism would not have found expression.
We are a proud race, and we are here because we intend to go on being proud.
- Go to auxiliary power!
- Auxiliary circuits destroyed, Captain.
"Tickle us, do we not laugh?
Prick us, do we not bleed?
"Wrong us,
"shall we not revenge?"
Gas.
Gas, Captain.
Under impulse power, she expends fuel like any other vessel.
We call it plasma, but whatever the Klingon designation, it is merely ionized gas.
Well, what about all of that equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
- Well, the thing's gotta have a tailpipe.
- Doctor, would you care to assist me
- in performing surgery on a torpedo?
- Fascinating.
Hard to starboard!
The proposed agenda is as follows.
The total evacuation of Kronos has been calculated within the 50-Earth-year time span.
Phase one, preparation for evacuation.
Come on, reach up!
Captain!
She's packing quite a wallop!
Shields weakening!
Shields up.
All right.
Now we've given them something else to shoot at.
Aye, sir.
The game's afoot, huh?
- Excelsior's been hit.
- "Our revels now are ended," Kirk.
"Cry 'Havoc!
' and let slip the dogs of war. "
Bones, where's my torpedo?
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed.
Emergency power!
Gravity control down!
Shields collapsing!
The key, please, Doctor.
Time is short.
The hull has been compromised.
- I wonder how bad?
- Connect echobars.
...to discuss the report on phase two.
- Alter circuit "A."
- Sensor.
I propose that we commence with the minutes of the preparation.
"I am constant as the northern star. "
I'd give real money if he'd shut up.
- Plate, please.
- Plate.
...and assimilation will consume...
We've got a heartbeat.
The Klingon empire, the ecological...
- Key, please.
- Key.
Where's that damn torpedo?
She's ready, Jim.
Lock and load.
Fire.
To be, or not to be.
Target that explosion and fire.
Fire.
As I imagine this work will occupy us throughout most of the week, it would be my hope that the delegation could return to their capitals to implement the provisions of phase one, no later than the first of next month.
Scotty.
As you know, time is of the essence.
- Out of the way!
- Out of the way!
Mr President!
Mr President!
Mr President!
Mr President!
Kirk, Enterprise.
Protect the Chancellor!
- Arrest those men!
- Arrest yourself.
We've got a full confession.
Cartwright, just a minute.
What's happened?
What's the meaning of all of this?
It's about the future, Madam Chancellor.
Some people think the future means the end of history.
Well, we haven't run out of history quite yet.
Your father called the future the undiscovered country.
People can be very frightened of change.
You've restored my father's faith.
And you've restored my son's.
Once again, we've saved civilisation as we know it.
And the good news is, they're not going to prosecute.
They might as well have prosecuted me.
I felt like Lieutenant Valeris.
Well, they don't arrest people for having feelings.
And it's a good thing, too.
If they did, we'd all have to turn ourselves in.
Captain Kirk.
Captain Sulu.
As much to the crew of the Enterprise, I owe you my thanks.
Nice to see you in action one more time, Captain Kirk.
Take care.
By God, that's a big ship.
- Not so big as her captain, I think.
- So, this is goodbye.
I think it's about time we got underway ourselves.
Captain, I have orders from Starfleet Command.
We're to put back to spacedock immediately to be decommissioned.
If I were human,
I believe my response would be,
"Go to hell. "
If I were human.
Course heading, Captain?
Second star to the right, and straight on till morning.
Captain's Log, Stardate 9529.1.
This is the final cruise ofthe Starship Enterprise under my command.
This ship and her history will shortly become the care of another crew.
To them and their posterity will we commit our future.
They will continue the voyages we have begun, and journey to all the undiscovered countries, boldly going where no man...
Where no one has gone before.
Captain's log U.S.S. Excelsior.
Hikaru Sulu commanding.
After three years I've concluded my first assignment as master of this vessel cataloguing gaseous planetary anomalies in Beta Quadrant.
We're heading home under full impulse power.
I'm pleased to report that ship and crew have functioned well.
According to this, we've completed our survey of the entire sector.
I have an energy wave at 240 degrees mark six port.
Visual!
My...
God!
Shields.
Shields!
She's not answering her helm.
Starboard thrusters.
Turn her into the wave.
Go to impulse power.
- Damage report.
- Checking all systems.
- That was no meteor shower.
- Negative, sir.
The sub-space shock-wave originated at bearing 323.75.
Location...
It's Praxis, sir.
It's a Klingon moon.
Praxis is their key energy production facility.
Send to Klingon High Command. "This is Excelsior, a Federation Starship."
"We have monitored a large explosion in your sector."
- "Do you require assistance?"
- Aye, sir.
- Mr Vultane, any more data?
- I've confirmed Praxis' location, but...
- I cannot confirm Praxis' existence.
- On screen.
- Magnify.
- Computer enhancement.
- Praxis?
- What's left of it, sir.
Captain, I'm getting a message from Praxis.
Let's have it.
This is Brigadier Kerla, speaking for the High Command.
There has been an incident on Praxis.
However, everything is under control.
We have no need for assistance.
Obey treaty stipulations and remain outside the Neutral Zone.
This transmission ends now.
- An incident?
- Do we report this, sir?
Are you kidding?
- What are we doing here?
- Maybe it's a retirement party.
That suits me.
I just bought a boat.
I'm supposed to be chairing a seminar at the Academy.
- Isn't this just for top brass?
- Where is Sulu?
Captain Sulu?
On assignment.
Where's Spock?
This briefing is classified.
Ladies and gentlemen, the C-in-C.
As you were.
I'll break this information down succinctly.
The Klingon empire has 50 years of life left.
For full details, I'm turning this briefing over to Federation Special Envoy.
Good morning.
Two months ago a Federation Starship monitored an explosion on Praxis.
We believe it was caused by over-mining and insufficient safety precautions.
The moon's decimation means deadly pollution of their ozone.
They will have depleted their oxygen supply in 50 Earth years.
Due to their enormous military budget the Klingon economy doesn't have the resources to combat this catastrophe.
Last month, at the behest of the Vulcan Ambassador, -
- I opened a dialogue with Gorkon, Chancellor of the Klingon High Council.
He proposes to commence negotiations at once.
Negotiations for what?
The dismantling of our space stations and bases along the Neutral Zone, an end to 70 years of hostility, which the Klingons can no longer afford.
Bill, are we talking about mothballing the Starfleet?
Our exploration and scientific programs would be unaffected, but...
I must protest!
To offer Klingons safe haven within Federation space is suicide.
Klingons would become the alien trash of the galaxy.
If we dismantle the fleet, we'd be defenceless before an aggressive species on our territory.
The opportunity here is to bring them to their knees.
Then we'll be in a better position to dictate terms.
- Sir...
- Captain Kirk?
The Klingons have never been trustworthy.
I agree with Admiral Cartwright.
This is a terrifying idea.
It is imperative that we act now to support the Gorkon initiative, lest more conservative elements persuade his empire that it's better to attempt a military solution and die fighting.
You, Captain Kirk, are to be our first olive branch.
We are to rendezvous with the vessel which is bringing Gorkon to Earth and to escort him safely through Federation space.
Me?
There are Klingons who feel the same about the peace treaty as yourself, but they'll think twice about attacking the Enterprise under your command.
I have personally vouched for you in this matter.
You have personally vouched...?
You will extend Chancellor Gorkon full diplomatic courtesy, Captain.
- A full Ambassador is better equipped...
- If there's no further business I wish you and your crew Godspeed.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
I remind you this meeting is classified.
I don't know whether to congratulate you or not, Jim.
I wouldn't.
We volunteered?
There's an old Vulcan proverb.
"Only Nixon could go to China."
How could you vouch for me?
- That's arrogant presumption.
- My father requested that I open...
I know your father is the Vulcan Ambassador, but you know how I feel.
- They're animals.
- Jim...
- There is an historic opportunity here.
- Don't believe them!
Don't trust them.
- They're dying.
- Let them die.
Has it occurred to you that this crew is due to stand down in three months?
We've done our bit for king and country.
You should have trusted me.
Control, this is S-D 103, approach to Space dock.
Over.
You are clear to deliver Captain Kirk and party to N.C.C. 1701 Alpha.
- Captain on the bridge!
- As you were.
Lieutenant?
Val'eris, sir.
We were told you needed a helmsman, so I volunteered.
It is agreeable to see you again.
She was the first Vulcan to graduate at the top of her class at the Academy.
- You must be very proud.
- I don't believe so, sir.
She's a Vulcan, alright.
Let's get this over with.
Departure stations.
- Scotty?
Did you find the engine room?
- Right where I left it.
Stand by.
Uhura, get me the dock master.
Control tower reading, sir.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
This is Control.
Permission to depart granted. 30 seconds for port gates.
- Clear all moorings.
- Awaiting port gates from this mark.
- All lines clear.
- Aft thrusters.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
1 quarter impulse power.
Captain, regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock.
Jim...
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
Aye, sir.
Captain's log.
Stardate 9522.6.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I can never forgive them for the death of my boy.
To escort the Chancellor of the Klingon High Council to a peace summit is problematic, at best.
Spock says this could be an historic occasion.
I'd like to believe him.
But how on Earth can history get past people like me?
- Sorry.
- You could have knocked.
We are almost at the rendezvous, sir.
I thought that you would like to know.
Permission to speak freely, sir.
It is an honour to serve with you.
You piloted well out of space dock, Lieutenant.
I've always wanted to try that.
You've done well, Val'eris.
As your sponsor at the Academy I've followed your career with satisfaction.
And as a Vulcan, you have exceeded my expectations.
I do not understand this representation.
It's a depiction from ancient Earth mythology.
"The expulsion from Paradise."
- Why keep it in your quarters?
- To remind me that all things end.
It is of endings that I wish to speak.
Sir, I address you as a kindred intellect.
Do you not recognise that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
History is replete with turning points.
You must have faith.
- Faith?
- The universe will unfold as it should.
- Is that logical?
Surely we must...
- Logic, logic, logic.
Logic is the beginning of wisdom, Val'eris.
Not the end.
This will be my final voyage on board this vessel as a member of her crew.
Nature abhors a vacuum.
I intend you to replace me.
I could only succeed you, sir.
Now hear this.
All offiicers to the bridge.
Klingon battle cruiser off the port bow.
All Officers to the bridge.
Captain on the bridge!
Shall we raise our shields, Captain?
I've never been this close.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
- Uhura, hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Right standard rudder.
Bring us alongside.
Right standard rudder.
Z plus 5 degrees.
Channel is open, Captain.
This is the Starship Enterprise.
Captain James T. Kirk commanding.
This is Kronos One.
I am Chancellor Gorkon.
We've been ordered to escort you to your meeting on Earth.
Thank you.
Would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard the Enterprise as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We would be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 19:30 hours.
I shall look forward to that.
I hope you're happy.
Captain!
There is a supply of Romulan ale aboard.
It might make the evening pass more... smoothly.
Officer thinking, Lieutenant.
Guess who's coming to dinner.
Energize.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- Captain Kirk.
May I present Captain Spock, whom I believe you know.
Captain, face to face at last.
You have my thanks.
Chancellor.
Gentlemen.
This is my daughter, Azetbur...
My military advisor, Brigadier Kerla...
General Chang, my chief of staff.
I have so wanted to meet you, Captain.
- I'm not sure how to take that.
- Sincere admiration, Kirk.
From one warrior to another.
Right...
This way.
You might enjoy a brief tour.
- They all look alike.
- What about that smell?
You know only top of the line models can even talk...
- You men have work?
- Yes, ma'am.
Then snap to it.
I offer a toast.
The undiscovered country.
- The future.
- The undiscovered country.
Hamlet, act 3, scene 1 .
You have not experienced Shake- speare until you've read him in Klingon.
Captain Kirk.
I thought Romulan ale was illegal.
An advantage of being 1,000 light years from Federation headquarters.
To you, Chancellor Gorkon.
One of the architects of our future.
Chancellor!
Perhaps we are looking at something of that future here.
Tell me, Captain Kirk.
Would you be willing to give up Starfleet?
The Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace.
I wouldn't dispute my first officer.
Starfleet has always been...
There's no need to mince words.
In space, all warriors are cold warriors.
General, are you fond of...
Shakespeare?
We believe all planets have a sovereign claim to inalienable human rights.
"Inalien..." If you could only hear yourselves.
"Human rights." Why, the very name is racist.
The Federation is a "homo sapiens only" club.
Present company excepted, of course.
We know where this is leading - the annihilation of our culture.
That's not true.
No!
"To be or not to be"...
That is the question which preoccupies our people.
- We need breathing room.
- Earth.
Hitler, 1938.
I beg your pardon.
Well...
I see we have a long way to go.
We must do this again sometime.
You don't trust me, do you?
I don't blame you.
If there is to be a brave new world, our generation is going to have the hardest time living in it.
- Captain Spock.
- Chancellor.
Madam.
Captain.
Well, most kind.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
Hmm, Captain?
"Have we not heard the chimes at midnight?"
Thank God!
- Did you see the way they ate?
- Terrible table manners.
I doubt our own behaviour will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy.
I'm going to sleep this off.
Is there any other way we can screw up tonight?
I'm going to go find a pot of black coffee.
The Enterprise hosted Chancellor Gorkon to dinner last night.
Our manners weren't exactly Emily Post.
To the galley
- Romulan ale no longer to be served at diplomatic functions.
Captain Kirk, will you please join me on the bridge?
Captain Kirk?
- Captain.
- What is it?
- I find this curious.
- Spock, I'm really tired.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
- Where?
- It appears to emanate from us.
The Enterprise?
Val'eris, do you know anything about a radiation surge?
Chekov?
Only the size of my head.
I know what you mean.
- What's happened?
- We've fired on the Chancellor's ship.
Torpedo room!
Please confirm, have we fired?
- Uhura, monitor.
- Aye, sir.
- Direct hit.
- Confirmed, sir.
We've lost gravity!
We are betrayed!
This is the bridge.
Do you read me?
- Did we fire those torpedoes?
- Negative.
We're still fully loaded.
Find Chang.
Unable to confirm or deny firing the torpedoes.
- Hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Kronos One, this is Enterprise.
Do you read?
It's very hard to make out.
There's been weapons firing and a lot of shouting.
- She's still listing.
- She's spinning out of control.
Restoring auxiliary gravity...
Have you not a shred of decency in you, Kirk?
We come in peace, and you blatantly defy that peace.
For that, I shall blow you out of the stars.
- We haven't fired.
- Captain...
According to our data banks, we have.
Twice...
Captain, they're coming about.
- They're preparing to fire.
- Shields up, Captain?
- Captain, our shields.
- Shields up, Captain?
Signal our surrender.
We surrender!
- This is Enterprise.
We surrender.
- If they fire, with our shields down...
- ...we will not be able to respond.
- Repeat, Enterprise surrenders.
- Are we firing torpedoes?
- I wish I knew.
- I'm going aboard.
Spock, take the con.
- I involved you, I will go.
No, I'll go.
We'll not be the instigators of war on the eve of universal peace.
I'm going too, they may need a doctor.
Uhura, tell them we're coming, and tell them we're unarmed.
- Have you lost your mind?
!
- I don't understand what's happened.
We're here to help.
Follow me.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- My God!
What has happened here?
- You dare to feign ignorance?
- What happened?
With a direct torpedo hit, you crippled our gravitational field and two of your Starfleet crew beamed aboard wearing magnetic boots.
- Aren't you carrying a surgeon?
- We were until this disgrace.
Then for god's sake, let me help.
I've got a pulse - we can move him.
I need light.
Put him on the table.
Hold him!
Hold him while I stabilize him.
I said hold him!
Sweet Jesus.
- Can you...?
- I don't even know his anatomy.
- His wounds are not closing.
- He's killing him!
He's gone into some kind of damned arrest.
Come on, dammit!
Come on!
He's not responding.
Don't let it end this way, Captain.
Under article 184 of your Interstellar Law I'm placing you under arrest.
You're charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
He tried to save him.
They've been arrested.
Mr Spock, we've got to do something.
I assume command of this ship as of 02:30 hours.
Commander Uhura, notify Starfleet headquarters and request instructions.
We cannot allow them to be taken to Kronos as prisoners.
Opening fire will not retrieve them, and we must avoid an armed conflict.
We will be able to follow the Captain's movements.
- How did you achieve this?
- Time is precious.
We must piece together what happened here tonight.
According to our data bank, this ship fired those torpedoes.
- No way!
- I sympathize, but we need evidence.
Please accompany me.
And if we cannot piece together what happened?
What then, sir?
In that case, Mr Chekov, it resides in the purview of the diplomats.
The Chancellor of the High Council is dead!
The result of an unprovoked attack while he travelled to see you under a flag of truce on a mission of peace!
Captain Kirk was legally arrested for the crime.
He and Dr. McCoy boarded Kronos One of their own free will.
- None of these facts are in dispute.
- I have ordered an investigation.
- In the meantime...
- In the meantime we expect the Federation to abide by the articles of Interstellar Law.
Kirk and Dr. McCoy will stand trial for the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon.
Out of the question.
Ambassador Sarek, can we get them extradited?
I share a measure of personal responsibility in this matter, but I am obliged to confirm my esteemed colleagues legal interpretation.
What is the position of the Romulan government?
I must concur with my colleagues.
You can't believe that Kirk assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council.
Mr President.
I don't know what to believe.
I'm waiting for your answer, sir.
This President is not above the law.
Mr President, Starfleet command is here from San Francisco.
- Mr President.
- Mr President.
Bill, Admiral Cartwright, please sit down.
Mr President, we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
I'm constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
Sir, would you please take a look at this.
We prepared Operation Retrieve based on the danger of terrorism between the Klingon empire and the Federation.
We can go in, rescue the hostages and get out in 24 hours with acceptable losses.
- We have the technology...
- Yes, yes.
But suppose you precipitate a full-scale war?
Then, quite frankly, we can clean their chronometers.
Mr President, they are vulnerable.
There will never be a better time.
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be.
I'll bear that in mind.
Thank you, gentlemen, that's all for now.
Mr President.
Sir...
Those men have literally saved this planet.
And now they're going to save it again.
By standing trial.
Report back on the double.
Do you read?
- We're to report back at once.
- We can't abandon Kirk and McCoy.
400 years ago, on Earth, workers who felt their livelyhood threatened flung their wooden shoes called "sabots" into the machines to stop them.
Hence the word "sabotage".
We experience technical malfunction.
All back-up systems inoperative.
Excellent.
I mean... too bad.
Mr President, I have been named chancellorin my father's place.
Madam Chancellor, you have my condolences on your loss.
I assure you that this shameful deed will not...
Let us come to the point.
You want this conference to go forward.
I will attend in one week, on one condition.
We will not extradite the prisoners, and you will not attempt to rescue them.
We would consider any such attempt an act of war.
We hope you'll be our guest here on Earth.
After recent events, you will understand if I prefer a neutral site.
And in the interest of security, let us keep the location secret for now.
As you wish, Madam Chancellor.
Attack them now, while we still can.
Attack or be slaves in their world.
We can take whole by force, what they propose to divide.
War is obsolete, General.
As we are in danger of becoming.
Better to die on our feet than live on our knees.
That wasn't what my father wanted.
Your father was killed for what he wanted.
The peace process will go forward.
Kirk...
Kirk will pay for my father's death.
It is as I said, Mr Spock.
Inventory registers every torpedo.
Yet the data banks insist we fired.
- One computer is lying.
- A computer doesn't lie!
Precisely.
Therefore we must inspect each torpedo visually.
That could take hours!
And if they're all there?
Then someone forged an entry in the data banks.
Gorkon's daughter has been named Chancellor.
It was on the news.
I'll bet that bitch killed her father.
- Her own father?
- It is an old story, sir.
They don't place the same value on life as we do, you know that.
Take my word, she did not shed one bloody tear.
Hardly conclusive, since Klingons have no tear-ducts.
Lieutenant, any response from Starfleet since our dispatch?
Yes, sir.
And?
Commander Uhura is experiencing technical difficulties, sir.
Curious.
Very well.
For 24 hours, we will agree this conversation didn't take place.
- A lie?
- An omission.
In 24 hours we won't have a clue where Captain Kirk is.
- I know precisely where he will be.
- You do?
Where?
Kirk, Kirk, Kirk, Kirk...
It's a damn show trial.
The Enterprise fired on Kronos One without provocation.
The Chancellor and his advisors having been lulled into a false sense of security by an invitation to a dinner aboard Captain Kirk's vessel at precisely 19:30 hours that same evening.
Call your first witness.
After the first shot we lost our gravitational field.
I was weightless and couldn't function.
Then two Starfleet crewmen came towards me.
Or perhaps they merely wore Starfleet uniforms.
That remark is speculative.
I move that it be stricken.
We're interested in facts, not theories.
If the gravitational unit was not functioning, how could they walk?
They appeared to be wearing magnetic boots.
- Gravity boots...?
- Dr. McCoy.
Would you be so good as to tell me what is your current medical status?
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
You have a singular wit, Doctor.
For 27 years I've been surgeon aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.
In three months I stand down.
You know...
I believe that you consumed rather a generous amount of Romulan ale in the officers mess on the night in question.
- Objection.
- Sustained.
We all did.
All of us.
That doesn't mean...
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
Barely.
Now be careful, Doctor.
Have you ever in your past saved patients as barely alive as he?
I didn't have the medical knowledge I needed for Klingon anatomy.
- I see.
- You where there.
You say you are due for retirement.
May I ask, do your hands shake?
- Objection!
- I was nervous.
No.
You were incompetent.
You were incompetent!
Whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink.
- The court will have to determine.
- My God, man.
I tried to save him!
I tried to save him.
I was desperate to save him.
He was the last best hope in the Universe for peace.
The witness is excused.
There we have it, citizens.
We have established the particulars of the crime.
And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair.
James Tiberius Kirk.
What would your favourite author say, Captain?
"Let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings."
Tell us your sad story, Kirk.
Tell us that you planned to take revenge for the death of your son.
- That's not true.
- Objection!
Captain Kirk has not been identified as the assassin.
I offer into the record this excerpt from the Captain's personal log.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I've never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Again!
Again!
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I've never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Are those your words?
Those words were spoken by me.
Objection!
My client's political views are not on trial.
On the contrary.
Captain Kirk's views are at the very heart of the matter.
His record shows him to be an insubordinate, unprincipled opportunist with a history of violating the chain of command whenever it suited him.
Continue.
The record shows that Captain Kirk once held the rank of Admiral and he was broken for taking matters into his own hands.
Do you deny being demoted for these charges.
Answer me now!
- I cannot deny it.
- You were demoted?
- For insubordination?
- On occasion, I have disobeyed orders.
Were you obeying or disobeying orders when you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?
I didn't know about it until we boarded the ship.
You still deny the Enterprise fired on Kronos One?
And you still deny your men beamed aboard and shot the Chancellor?
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I didn't witness.
Are you aware that as the captain of a ship, you are responsible for the actions of your men?
I am.
If it's proved that members of your crew carried out the assassination...
- They're setting us up.
Your Honours!
- Do not answer.
Captain Kirk, you will answer the question.
As Captain I'm responsible for the crew under my command.
Your Honours, the state rests.
Send to Commander Enterprise.
"We stand ready to assist you.
Captain Sulu, U.S.S. Excelsior."
It is the determination of this court that the prisoners are guilty as charged.
I wish to note for the record that all the evidence is circumstantial.
I beg the court to consider this when pronouncing its sentence.
So noted.
Captain James T. Kirk, Dr. Leonard McCoy.
In the interest of fostering amity for the forthcoming peace talks, the sentence of death is commuted.
It is the judgement of this court that, without possibility of reprieve or parole, you be taken from this place to the dilithium mines on the penal asteroid of Rura Penthe.
There to spend the rest of your natural lives.
Rura Penthe!
Known throughout the galaxy as the alien's graveyard.
Better to kill them now and get it over with.
Lieutenant.
The torpedo hit once again, please.
Hold.
It is Enterprise.
We fired.
That is not possible!
All weapons visually accounted for, sir.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains must be the truth.
What does that mean?
That if we cannot have fired those torpedoes, someone else did.
They didn't fire on themselves and there are no other ships present.
- There was a neutron surge.
- Not from us.
A neutron surge that big could only be produced by another ship.
- Kronos One?
- Too far away.
Very near us.
Possibly beneath us.
If there were a ship beneath us, the Klingons would have seen it.
Would they?
- A Bird of Prey?
- A Bird of Prey.
- Cloaked?
- They can't fired when they're cloaked.
All things being equal, I would agree.
However, things are not equal.
This one can.
- We must inform Starfleet Command.
- Of what?
A new weapon that's invisible?
They'll call us raving lunatics.
They'll say we'll say anything to exonerate the Captain.
And they would be correct.
We have no evidence.
Only a theory which happens to fit the facts.
Assuming you're right.
Why would they fire on their own President?
Indeed.
This ship will be searched from bow to stern.
I do not understand.
If there was a ship underneath us surely the assassins beamed aboard from that vessel, not Enterprise.
You're forgetting something, Mr Chekov.
According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
If we did, the killers are here.
If we did not, whoever altered the data banks is here.
In either case, what we are looking for is here.
- What are we looking for, sir?
- Lieutenant.
Two pairs of gravity boots.
This is the gulag Rura Penthe.
There is no stockades, no guard tower, no electronic frontier.
Only a magnetic shield prevents beaming.
Punishment means exile from prison to the surface.
On the surface, nothing can survive.
Work well, and you will be treated well.
Work badly, and you will die.
Oh, my God!
The universal translator has been confiscated.
I'm sorry...?
He's definitely on about something, Jim.
If this is your spot, we'll move on.
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
- He's got it.
- And your coat.
I'm afraid not.
It wouldn't fit.
- Thanks.
- This will help keep you warm.
- I'm Martia.
You're Kirk and McCoy.
- How did you know that?
We don't get many presidential assassins.
- We didn't kill Gorkon.
- Of course not.
- But there's a reward for your death.
- That figures.
We've been set up.
Somebody up there wants you out of the way.
- Any progress?
- None.
A crew of 300 are looking everywhere, but the killers may still be among them.
Surely they have disposed of these boots by now.
Would it not have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
Logic must give way to physics.
Gravity wasn't restored when they escaped.
Without the boots, they would have floated off the transporter pads.
Why not simply vaporize them?
Like this?
As you know, no one can fire an unauthorized phaser aboard a starship.
Suppose, when they returned, they threw the boots into the refuse.
I'm having the refuse searched.
If I'm correct, those boots will cling to the killer's necks like Tiberian bats.
They couldn't escape without them nor throw them out the window.
Those boots are here.
Somewhere.
- Did someone fire off a phaser?
- It's alright.
It's nothing.
Mr Spock, Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
- Who fired the...
- Ah, Mr Scott.
I hear you have difficulty with the warp drive.
How long do you need for repair?
There's nothing wrong with the bloody thing.
If we return to space dock, the killers can dispose of their footwear and we will never see the Captain or Dr. McCoy alive again.
- It could take weeks.
- Thank you.
Val'eris, inform Starfleet our warp drive is inoperative.
- A lie?
- An error.
We have lost all contact with the Captain and Dr. McCoy.
Yes, at the moment they're surrounded by a magnetic shield.
But if I know the Captain, he is deep into planning his escape.
You've got him where you want him, Jim!
- Are you alright?
- I think so.
- They'll respect you now.
- I was lucky that thing had knees.
That was not his knee.
Not everybody keep their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Anything you want to tell me?
See what you can do for him.
Let him know we're not holding a grudge.
Suppose he's holding a grudge?
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
- Do you want to get out of here?
- There's got to be a way.
Three months before retirement.
What a way to finish.
- We're not finished.
- Speak for yourself.
One day, one night...
Kobayashi Maru!
Bones!
Are you afraid of the future?
I believe that was the general idea that I was trying to convey.
- I don't mean this future.
- What is this - multiple choice?
Some people are afraid...
of what might happen.
- I was terrified.
- What terrified you, specifically?
No more neutral zone.
I was used to hating Klingons.
It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his words.
- Spock was right.
- We all felt exactly the same.
No.
Somebody felt a lot worse.
I'm beginning to understand why.
If you've got any bright ideas, now is the time.
Time is the problem.
You and I are nothing.
You heard the judge - the peace conference is on again.
Whoever killed Gorkon is bound to attempt another assassination.
Unless we can get out of here.
It's me
- Martia.
Listen.
No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
- Except us.
- It is possible.
I know how to get outside the shield.
- How do we fit in?
- Getting outside the shield is easy.
After that, you have to get us off the surface before we freeze.
Can you?
- It's possible.
- I can't make it alone.
You're the likeliest candidate to come here for months.
Candidate for what?
Go to lift 7 in the morning for mining duty.
I'll see you there.
Don't disappoint me.
- What is it with you, anyway?
- Still think we're finished?
More than ever.
Sorry to wake you, sir.
Starfleet requests any data we have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
What?
They're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to space dock, sir.
Signal Starfleet that we have no idea location Enterprise.
- Sir?
- You have hearing problems?
No, sir.
Klingon blood.
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
This is the first evidence which corroborates our theory.
Now we go to Starfleet?
We expand our search to include uniforms.
All uniforms?
Clear, sir.
Make a hole.
Coming through.
Coming through.
Sir!
Sir!
- I think we've been had.
- No, you weren't, Doctor.
Get off at the first level.
Follow the gang into the mine.
They don't take girls.
- You are crewman Dax?
- Yes.
What is the problem?
Perhaps you know Russian epic of Cinderella?
If shoe fits - wear it.
Mr Chekov...
Watch me.
What kind of creature is this?
Last night you two were...
Get in.
Come on.
We don't have a lot of time.
Hurry!
Up there.
Come on - climb!
Here, you'll need these.
Quickly!
Stay close.
- There they are.
- They emerge from the beaming shield.
Mr Scott, start your engines.
Mr Chekov, set course for Rura Penthe.
Mr Spock, Rura Penthe is deep inside the Klingon frontier.
- If we're discovered...
- Correct.
We need a feat of linguistic legerdemain and intrepidity before the Captain and Dr. McCoy freeze to death.
- Leave me, I'm finished.
- No!
Bones, I'm wearing a viridium patch on my back.
Spock slapped it there before we went on Gorkon's ship.
That cunning little Vulcan.
Come on!
We're in the clear.
Now that we're outside the shield, they can locate us two sectors away.
If they're even looking for us.
This is listening post Morska.
What ship is that, over?
We must respond.
A universal translator would be recognised.
We am thy freighter...
Ursva.
Six weeks out of Kronos.
"What is your destination, over? "
We is condemning food things and supplies.
Don't catch any bugs.
Would you mind explaining that little trick you do?
- I'm a Chameloid.
- I've heard about you.
Shape-shifters.
I thought you were mythical.
Give a girl a chance, Captain.
It takes a lot of effort.
I don't doubt it.
Stop me if I'm wrong, but do we have any way of knowing whether this is the real you?
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.
We're outside the shield.
Now it's your turn, Captain.
If you say so.
Are you crazy?
!
She didn't need our help.
Where did you get these convenient clothes?
Don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue.
It's to let them know where we are.
Ask her what she's getting in return.
A full pardon... which doesn't cover this.
An accident wasn't good enough.
Come on, Spock.
Good enough for one.
Two would have looked suspicious.
Killed while attempting escape.
That's convincing for both.
Surprise!
- Your friends are late.
- They'll be along.
- I can't believe I kissed you.
- Must have been your lifelong ambition.
Isn't it time you became something else?
I like it here.
Well, well, well...
What took you so long?
Kill him, he's the one.
Not me, you idiot - him!
- No witnesses.
- Killed while trying to escape.
- Damned clever, if you ask me.
- It's a classic.
- That's what he wanted.
- Who?
Who wanted us killed?
Since you're all going to die anyway, why not tell you?
His name is...
Damn it!
What the hell!
Son of a...!
Couldn't you have waited two seconds?
He was about to explain the whole thing.
- You want to go back?
- Absolutely not!
This is the bridge.
We're still in Klingon space.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
They were beamed aboard a Federation Starship.
I could trace...
Escaped.
Kirk cannot know the location of the peace conference.
Are you sure?
Will you take that chance?
Helmsman, make course to intercept Enterprise.
The Klingons have a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked.
- She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
- So that's it.
We believe that Gorkon's murderers are aboard this ship.
- Has the peace conference begun?
- Who knows?
The location is secret.
- There's always something.
- Captain!
Mr Spock!
I found the uniforms with the Klingon blood on them.
But the uniforms belong to these two men.
Burke and Samno.
Not anymore.
Phaser on "stun" at close range.
First rule of assassination - kill the assassins.
- Now we're back to square one.
- Can I talk to you?
- Why weren't they vaporized?
- It would set off the alarm.
It's possible.
Now hear this.
Now hear this.
Court reporter to sick bay.
Code blue - urgent.
Statements to be taken at once from Yeomen Burke and Samno.
Repeat, court reporter to sick bay.
Code blue - urgent.
Statements to be taken.
Repeat, statements to be taken from Yeomen Burke and Samno.
You have to shoot.
If you are logical, you have to shoot.
- I do not want to.
- What you want is irrelevant.
What you've chosen is at hand.
I'd just as soon you didn't.
The operation is over.
I did not fire.
You cannot prove anything.
Yes, I can.
At my trial my personal log was used against me.
How long did you wait outside my quarters before I noticed you?
You knew?
I tried to tell you, but you would not listen.
Neither of us was hearing very well that night.
There were things I tried to tell you, about having faith.
You have betrayed the Federation.
All of you.
- And what have you've been doing?
- Saving Starfleet.
Klingons cannot be trusted.
Sir...
You said so yourself.
They killed your son.
Did you not wish Gorkon dead?
"Let them die", you said.
Did I misinterpret you?
And you were right.
They conspired with us to assassinate their own Chancellor.
How trustworthy can they be?
Klingons and Federation members conspiring together.
- Who is "us"?
- All who stands to lose from peace.
Names, Lieutenant.
My comrades will make certain all your transmissions are jammed.
- Names, Lieutenant!
- I do not remember.
A lie?
A choice.
Spock.
Admiral Cartwright.
From Starfleet?
Who else?
General...
Chang.
- Who else?
- Romulan Ambassador and others.
Where is the peace conference?
Where is the peace conference?
She does not know.
Then we're dead.
I have been dead before.
Contact Excelsior.
- She'll have the co-ordinates.
- I've already got it, sir.
- Standing by, Captain Kirk.
- Sulu.
You realize that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations.
I'm sorry, Captain.
Yourmessage is breaking up.
Bless you, Sulu.
Where is the peace conference?
They'll attempt another assassination.
It's at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border.
I'm sending the co-ordinates on a coded frequency.
We'll need more than that.
There's a Bird of Prey on the look-out for us that can fire when cloaked.
Surely not.
How many of those things are there?
Come on, Lieutenant.
- Just the prototype.
- Do you hear that?
I'm getting under way now.
We're in Alpha Quadrant.
The chances of our reaching the conference in time are slim.
- When does this conference start?
- According to my information - today.
- Thank you, Captain Sulu.
- Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
Spock?
I prefer it dark.
- Dining on ashes?
- You were right.
It was arrogant presumption on my part that got us into this situation.
You and the Doctor might have been killed.
The night is young.
You said it yourself, it was logical.
Peace is worth a few personal risks.
You're a great one for logic.
I'm a great one for rushing in where angels fear to tread.
We're both extremists.
Reality is probably somewhere in between.
I couldn't get past the death of my son.
I was prejudiced by her accomplishments as a Vulcan.
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was.
Is it possible that we two, you and I, have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?
Would that constitute a joke?
- It wasn't your fault.
- I was responsible.
- For no actions but your own.
- That's not what you said at your trial.
That was as captain of the ship.
Human beings...
We both know that I am not human.
Do you want to know something?
Everybody's human.
I find that remark... insulting.
Come, I need you.
Madam Chancellor, members of the diplomatic corps honoured guests.
The United Federation of Planets welcomes you to Camp Khitomer.
She's out here somewhere.
- But if she's cloaked...
- Then all we have is a radiation surge.
By the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes.
2.06... 2.03...
- Close enough to beam down?
- Not yet.
In two minutes. 1 .58.
Go to impulse power for Khitomer.
Let us redefine progress to mean that just because we can do a thing it does not necessarily follow that we must do that thing.
- Uhura?
- Nothing, Captain.
If she's here, she's rigged for silent running.
Coming up on transporter range in 57 seconds.
Transporter room.
Stand by to beam down.
53... 48 seconds.
44...
I can see you, Kirk.
Chang.
Can you see me?
Now be honest, Captain.
Warrior to warrior.
You do prefer it this way, don't you?
As it was meant to be.
No peace in our time.
"Once more unto the breach, dearfriends. "
- This is fun.
- Reverse engines.
All astern.
One and a half impulse power.
Back off!
What's she doing?
What's she waiting for?
Probably attempting to ascertain why we are reversing.
Wondering whether we detect her.
Incoming!
- In range?
- Not yet, sir.
Come on!
- She'll fly apart.
- Fly her apart, then!
Many speculated about my father's motives.
Some said he was an idealist.
Others said he had no choice.
If Praxis had not exploded, his idealism wouldn't have found expression.
We are a proud race.
We are here because we intend to go on being proud.
- Go to auxiliary power!
- Auxiliary circuits destroyed.
"Tickle us, do we not laugh?
Prick us, do we not bleed?"
"Wrong us, shall we not revenge?"
Gas.
Gas, Captain.
Under impulse power she expands fuel, like all vessels.
We call it "plasma", but it is merely ionised gas.
What about our equipment to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
The thing's got to have a tail-pipe.
Doctor, would you assist me in performing surgery on a torpedo?
Fascinating.
Hard to starboard.
The proposed agenda is as follows:
The evacuation of Kronos has been calculated within the 50 Earth year time span.
Phase 1 - preparation for evacuation...
Captain, she's packing quite a wallop.
Shields weakening.
Shields up!
Alright, now we're giving them something else to shoot at.
The game's afoot.
- Excelsior's been hit!
- "Our revels now are ended", Kirk.
"Cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war."
- Bones, where's my torpedo?
- Bet you wished you'd stayed in bed.
Shields collapsing!
The key, please.
Time is short.
- The hull has been compromised.
- I wonder how bad.
Connect echo-bars.
...discuss the report on phase 2.
- Alter circuit A.
- Sensor.
...we commence within minutes of the preparation.
- "I am constant as the Northern star."
- I'd give real money, if he'd shut up.
Plate, please.
...and assimilation will consume...
We've got a heart beat.
...with the Klingon Empire...
Key, please.
- Where's that torpedo?
- She's ready.
Lock and load!
Fire!
"To be... or not" "to be."
Target that explosion and fire.
Fire!
This work will occupy us throughout most of the week.
I hope that the delegation can implement the provisions of Phase 1 by the first of next month.
As you know, time is of the essence.
Out of the way!
Mr President!
Mr President!
Kirk, Enterprise.
Protect the Chancellor!
- Arrest those men!
- Arrest yourself!
We've got a full confession.
- This is not Klingon blood.
- Cartwright.
Just a minute.
It's Colonel West!
What's happened?
What's the mean of all of this?
It's about the future, Madam Chancellor.
Some people think the future means the end of history.
We haven't run out of history quite yet.
Your father called the future "the undiscovered country".
People can be very frightened of change.
You've restored my father's faith.
And you've restored my son's.
Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
And they're not going to prosecute.
They could have prosecuted me.
I felt like Val'eris.
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
And it's a good thing, too.
If they did, we'd all have to turn ourselves in.
- Captain Kirk.
- Captain Sulu.
As much to the crew of the Enterprise, I owe you my thanks.
Nice to see you in action one more time, Captain Kirk.
Take care.
- My God, that's a big ship.
- Not so big as her captain.
So...
This is goodbye?
It's about time we got underway ourselves.
Captain, I have orders from Starfleet Command.
We're to put back to space dock immediately... to be decommissioned.
If I were human, I believe my response would be:
"Go to hell."
If I were human.
Course heading, Captain?
Second star to the right.
And straight on 'til morning.
Captain's log, stardate 9529. 1.
This is the final cruise of the Starship Enterprise under my command.
This ship, and her history will shortly become the care of another crew.
To them and their posterity will we commit our future.
They'll continue the voyages we have begun and journey to all the undiscovered countries boldly going where no man, where no one has gone before.
We've lost gravity!
We are betrayed!
Restoring auxiliary gravity.
Attack them now, while we still can!
Attack or be slaves in their world.
We can take whole by force, what they propose to divide.
War is obsolete, General, as we are in danger of becoming.
Better to die on our feet than live on our knees.
That wasn't what my father wanted.
Again!
Again!
This is listening post Morska.
What ship is that?
Over.
We am thy freighter...
Ursva.
Six weeks out of Kronos.
We is condemning food things and supplies.
Don't catch any bugs!
They were beamed aboard a Federation starship.
I could trace...
Escaped.
Kirk cannot know the location of the peace conference.
Are you sure?
Will you take that chance?
Helmsman, make course to intercept Enterprise.
What's she doing?
Protect the Chancellor!
Captain's log U.S.S. Excelsior.
Hikaru Sulu commanding.
After three years I've concluded my first assignment as master of this vessel cataloguing gaseous planetary anomalies in Beta Quadrant.
We're heading home under full impulse power.
I'm pleased to report that ship and crew have functioned well.
According to this, we've completed our survey of the entire sector.
I have an energy wave at 240 degrees mark six port.
Visual!
My...
God!
Shields.
Shields!
She's not answering her helm.
Starboard thrusters.
Turn her into the wave.
Go to impulse power.
- Damage report.
- Checking all systems.
- That was no meteor shower.
- Negative, sir.
The sub-space shock-wave originated at bearing 323.75.
Location...
It's Praxis, sir.
It's a Klingon moon.
Praxis is their key energy production facility.
Send to Klingon High Command. "This is Excelsior, a Federation Starship."
"We have monitored a large explosion in your sector."
- "Do you require assistance?"
- Aye, sir.
- Mr Vultane, any more data?
- I've confirmed Praxis' location, but...
- I cannot confirm Praxis' existence.
- On screen.
- Magnify.
- Computer enhancement.
- Praxis?
- What's left of it, sir.
Captain, I'm getting a message from Praxis.
Let's have it.
This is Brigadier Kerla, speaking for the High Command.
There has been an incident on Praxis.
However, everything is under control.
We have no need for assistance.
Obey treaty stipulations and remain outside the Neutral Zone.
This transmission ends now.
- An incident?
- Do we report this, sir?
Are you kidding?
- What are we doing here?
- Maybe it's a retirement party.
That suits me.
I just bought a boat.
I'm supposed to be chairing a seminar at the Academy.
- Isn't this just for top brass?
- Where is Sulu?
Captain Sulu?
On assignment.
Where's Spock?
This briefing is classified.
Ladies and gentlemen, the C-in-C.
As you were.
I'll break this information down succinctly.
The Klingon empire has 50 years of life left.
For full details, I'm turning this briefing over to Federation Special Envoy.
Good morning.
Two months ago a Federation Starship monitored an explosion on Praxis.
We believe it was caused by over-mining and insufficient safety precautions.
The moon's decimation means deadly pollution of their ozone.
They will have depleted their oxygen supply in 50 Earth years.
Due to their enormous military budget the Klingon economy doesn't have the resources to combat this catastrophe.
Last month, at the behest of the Vulcan Ambassador, -
- I opened a dialogue with Gorkon, Chancellor of the Klingon High Council.
He proposes to commence negotiations at once.
Negotiations for what?
The dismantling of our space stations and bases along the Neutral Zone, an end to 70 years of hostility, which the Klingons can no longer afford.
Bill, are we talking about mothballing the Starfleet?
Our exploration and scientific programs would be unaffected, but...
I must protest!
To offer Klingons safe haven within Federation space is suicide.
Klingons would become the alien trash of the galaxy.
If we dismantle the fleet, we'd be defenceless before an aggressive species on our territory.
The opportunity here is to bring them to their knees.
Then we'll be in a better position to dictate terms.
- Sir...
- Captain Kirk?
The Klingons have never been trustworthy.
I agree with Admiral Cartwright.
This is a terrifying idea.
It is imperative that we act now to support the Gorkon initiative, lest more conservative elements persuade his empire that it's better to attempt a military solution and die fighting.
You, Captain Kirk, are to be our first olive branch.
We are to rendezvous with the vessel which is bringing Gorkon to Earth and to escort him safely through Federation space.
Me?
There are Klingons who feel the same about the peace treaty as yourself, but they'll think twice about attacking the Enterprise under your command.
I have personally vouched for you in this matter.
You have personally vouched...?
You will extend Chancellor Gorkon full diplomatic courtesy, Captain.
- A full Ambassador is better equipped...
- If there's no further business I wish you and your crew Godspeed.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
I remind you this meeting is classified.
I don't know whether to congratulate you or not, Jim.
I wouldn't.
We volunteered?
There's an old Vulcan proverb.
"Only Nixon could go to China."
How could you vouch for me?
- That's arrogant presumption.
- My father requested that I open...
I know your father is the Vulcan Ambassador, but you know how I feel.
- They're animals.
- Jim...
- There is an historic opportunity here.
- Don't believe them!
Don't trust them.
- They're dying.
- Let them die.
Has it occurred to you that this crew is due to stand down in three months?
We've done our bit for king and country.
You should have trusted me.
Control, this is S-D 103, approach to Space dock.
Over.
You are clear to deliver Captain Kirk and party to N.C.C. 1701 Alpha.
- Captain on the bridge!
- As you were.
Lieutenant?
Val'eris, sir.
We were told you needed a helmsman, so I volunteered.
It is agreeable to see you again.
She was the first Vulcan to graduate at the top of her class at the Academy.
- You must be very proud.
- I don't believe so, sir.
She's a Vulcan, alright.
Let's get this over with.
Departure stations.
- Scotty?
Did you find the engine room?
- Right where I left it.
Stand by.
Uhura, get me the dock master.
Control tower reading, sir.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
This is Control.
Permission to depart granted. 30 seconds for port gates.
- Clear all moorings.
- Awaiting port gates from this mark.
- All lines clear.
- Aft thrusters.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
1 quarter impulse power.
Captain, regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock.
Jim...
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
Aye, sir.
Captain's log.
Stardate 9522.6.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I can never forgive them for the death of my boy.
To escort the Chancellor of the Klingon High Council to a peace summit is problematic, at best.
Spock says this could be an historic occasion.
I'd like to believe him.
But how on Earth can history get past people like me?
- Sorry.
- You could have knocked.
We are almost at the rendezvous, sir.
I thought that you would like to know.
Permission to speak freely, sir.
It is an honour to serve with you.
You piloted well out of space dock, Lieutenant.
I've always wanted to try that.
You've done well, Val'eris.
As your sponsor at the Academy I've followed your career with satisfaction.
And as a Vulcan, you have exceeded my expectations.
I do not understand this representation.
It's a depiction from ancient Earth mythology.
"The expulsion from Paradise."
- Why keep it in your quarters?
- To remind me that all things end.
It is of endings that I wish to speak.
Sir, I address you as a kindred intellect.
Do you not recognise that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
History is replete with turning points.
You must have faith.
- Faith?
- The universe will unfold as it should.
- Is that logical?
Surely we must...
- Logic, logic, logic.
Logic is the beginning of wisdom, Val'eris.
Not the end.
This will be my final voyage on board this vessel as a member of her crew.
Nature abhors a vacuum.
I intend you to replace me.
I could only succeed you, sir.
Now hear this.
All offiicers to the bridge.
Klingon battle cruiser off the port bow.
All Officers to the bridge.
Captain on the bridge!
Shall we raise our shields, Captain?
I've never been this close.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
- Uhura, hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Right standard rudder.
Bring us alongside.
Right standard rudder.
Z plus 5 degrees.
Channel is open, Captain.
This is the Starship Enterprise.
Captain James T. Kirk commanding.
This is Kronos One.
I am Chancellor Gorkon.
We've been ordered to escort you to your meeting on Earth.
Thank you.
Would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard the Enterprise as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We would be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 19:30 hours.
I shall look forward to that.
I hope you're happy.
Captain!
There is a supply of Romulan ale aboard.
It might make the evening pass more... smoothly.
Officer thinking, Lieutenant.
Guess who's coming to dinner.
Energize.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- Captain Kirk.
May I present Captain Spock, whom I believe you know.
Captain, face to face at last.
You have my thanks.
Chancellor.
Gentlemen.
This is my daughter, Azetbur...
My military advisor, Brigadier Kerla...
General Chang, my chief of staff.
I have so wanted to meet you, Captain.
- I'm not sure how to take that.
- Sincere admiration, Kirk.
From one warrior to another.
Right...
This way.
You might enjoy a brief tour.
- They all look alike.
- What about that smell?
You know only top of the line models can even talk...
- You men have work?
- Yes, ma'am.
Then snap to it.
I offer a toast.
The undiscovered country.
- The future.
- The undiscovered country.
Hamlet, act 3, scene 1 .
You have not experienced Shake- speare until you've read him in Klingon.
Captain Kirk.
I thought Romulan ale was illegal.
An advantage of being 1,000 light years from Federation headquarters.
To you, Chancellor Gorkon.
One of the architects of our future.
Chancellor!
Perhaps we are looking at something of that future here.
Tell me, Captain Kirk.
Would you be willing to give up Starfleet?
The Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace.
I wouldn't dispute my first officer.
Starfleet has always been...
There's no need to mince words.
In space, all warriors are cold warriors.
General, are you fond of...
Shakespeare?
We believe all planets have a sovereign claim to inalienable human rights.
"Inalien..." If you could only hear yourselves.
"Human rights." Why, the very name is racist.
The Federation is a "homo sapiens only" club.
Present company excepted, of course.
We know where this is leading - the annihilation of our culture.
That's not true.
No!
"To be or not to be"...
That is the question which preoccupies our people.
- We need breathing room.
- Earth.
Hitler, 1938.
I beg your pardon.
Well...
I see we have a long way to go.
We must do this again sometime.
You don't trust me, do you?
I don't blame you.
If there is to be a brave new world, our generation is going to have the hardest time living in it.
- Captain Spock.
- Chancellor.
Madam.
Captain.
Well, most kind.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
Hmm, Captain?
"Have we not heard the chimes at midnight?"
Thank God!
- Did you see the way they ate?
- Terrible table manners.
I doubt our own behaviour will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy.
I'm going to sleep this off.
Is there any other way we can screw up tonight?
I'm going to go find a pot of black coffee.
The Enterprise hosted Chancellor Gorkon to dinner last night.
Our manners weren't exactly Emily Post.
To the galley
- Romulan ale no longer to be served at diplomatic functions.
Captain Kirk, will you please join me on the bridge?
Captain Kirk?
- Captain.
- What is it?
- I find this curious.
- Spock, I'm really tired.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
- Where?
- It appears to emanate from us.
The Enterprise?
Val'eris, do you know anything about a radiation surge?
Chekov?
Only the size of my head.
I know what you mean.
- What's happened?
- We've fired on the Chancellor's ship.
Torpedo room!
Please confirm, have we fired?
- Uhura, monitor.
- Aye, sir.
- Direct hit.
- Confirmed, sir.
We've lost gravity!
We are betrayed!
This is the bridge.
Do you read me?
- Did we fire those torpedoes?
- Negative.
We're still fully loaded.
Find Chang.
Unable to confirm or deny firing the torpedoes.
- Hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Kronos One, this is Enterprise.
Do you read?
It's very hard to make out.
There's been weapons firing and a lot of shouting.
- She's still listing.
- She's spinning out of control.
Restoring auxiliary gravity...
Have you not a shred of decency in you, Kirk?
We come in peace, and you blatantly defy that peace.
For that, I shall blow you out of the stars.
- We haven't fired.
- Captain...
According to our data banks, we have.
Twice...
Captain, they're coming about.
- They're preparing to fire.
- Shields up, Captain?
- Captain, our shields.
- Shields up, Captain?
Signal our surrender.
We surrender!
- This is Enterprise.
We surrender.
- If they fire, with our shields down...
- ...we will not be able to respond.
- Repeat, Enterprise surrenders.
- Are we firing torpedoes?
- I wish I knew.
- I'm going aboard.
Spock, take the con.
- I involved you, I will go.
No, I'll go.
We'll not be the instigators of war on the eve of universal peace.
I'm going too, they may need a doctor.
Uhura, tell them we're coming, and tell them we're unarmed.
- Have you lost your mind?
!
- I don't understand what's happened.
We're here to help.
Follow me.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- My God!
What has happened here?
- You dare to feign ignorance?
- What happened?
With a direct torpedo hit, you crippled our gravitational field and two of your Starfleet crew beamed aboard wearing magnetic boots.
- Aren't you carrying a surgeon?
- We were until this disgrace.
Then for god's sake, let me help.
I've got a pulse - we can move him.
I need light.
Put him on the table.
Hold him!
Hold him while I stabilize him.
I said hold him!
Sweet Jesus.
- Can you...?
- I don't even know his anatomy.
- His wounds are not closing.
- He's killing him!
He's gone into some kind of damned arrest.
Come on, dammit!
Come on!
He's not responding.
Don't let it end this way, Captain.
Under article 184 of your Interstellar Law I'm placing you under arrest.
You're charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
He tried to save him.
They've been arrested.
Mr Spock, we've got to do something.
I assume command of this ship as of 02:30 hours.
Commander Uhura, notify Starfleet headquarters and request instructions.
We cannot allow them to be taken to Kronos as prisoners.
Opening fire will not retrieve them, and we must avoid an armed conflict.
We will be able to follow the Captain's movements.
- How did you achieve this?
- Time is precious.
We must piece together what happened here tonight.
According to our data bank, this ship fired those torpedoes.
- No way!
- I sympathize, but we need evidence.
Please accompany me.
And if we cannot piece together what happened?
What then, sir?
In that case, Mr Chekov, it resides in the purview of the diplomats.
The Chancellor of the High Council is dead!
The result of an unprovoked attack while he travelled to see you under a flag of truce on a mission of peace!
Captain Kirk was legally arrested for the crime.
He and Dr. McCoy boarded Kronos One of their own free will.
- None of these facts are in dispute.
- I have ordered an investigation.
- In the meantime...
- In the meantime we expect the Federation to abide by the articles of Interstellar Law.
Kirk and Dr. McCoy will stand trial for the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon.
Out of the question.
Ambassador Sarek, can we get them extradited?
I share a measure of personal responsibility in this matter, but I am obliged to confirm my esteemed colleagues legal interpretation.
What is the position of the Romulan government?
I must concur with my colleagues.
You can't believe that Kirk assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council.
Mr President.
I don't know what to believe.
I'm waiting for your answer, sir.
This President is not above the law.
Mr President, Starfleet command is here from San Francisco.
- Mr President.
- Mr President.
Bill, Admiral Cartwright, please sit down.
Mr President, we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
I'm constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
Sir, would you please take a look at this.
We prepared Operation Retrieve based on the danger of terrorism between the Klingon empire and the Federation.
We can go in, rescue the hostages and get out in 24 hours with acceptable losses.
- We have the technology...
- Yes, yes.
But suppose you precipitate a full-scale war?
Then, quite frankly, we can clean their chronometers.
Mr President, they are vulnerable.
There will never be a better time.
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be.
I'll bear that in mind.
Thank you, gentlemen, that's all for now.
Mr President.
Sir...
Those men have literally saved this planet.
And now they're going to save it again.
By standing trial.
Report back on the double.
Do you read?
- We're to report back at once.
- We can't abandon Kirk and McCoy.
400 years ago, on Earth, workers who felt their livelyhood threatened flung their wooden shoes called "sabots" into the machines to stop them.
Hence the word "sabotage".
We experience technical malfunction.
All back-up systems inoperative.
Excellent.
I mean... too bad.
Mr President, I have been named chancellorin my father's place.
Madam Chancellor, you have my condolences on your loss.
I assure you that this shameful deed will not...
Let us come to the point.
You want this conference to go forward.
I will attend in one week, on one condition.
We will not extradite the prisoners, and you will not attempt to rescue them.
We would consider any such attempt an act of war.
We hope you'll be our guest here on Earth.
After recent events, you will understand if I prefer a neutral site.
And in the interest of security, let us keep the location secret for now.
As you wish, Madam Chancellor.
Attack them now, while we still can.
Attack or be slaves in their world.
We can take whole by force, what they propose to divide.
War is obsolete, General.
As we are in danger of becoming.
Better to die on our feet than live on our knees.
That wasn't what my father wanted.
Your father was killed for what he wanted.
The peace process will go forward.
Kirk...
Kirk will pay for my father's death.
It is as I said, Mr Spock.
Inventory registers every torpedo.
Yet the data banks insist we fired.
- One computer is lying.
- A computer doesn't lie!
Precisely.
Therefore we must inspect each torpedo visually.
That could take hours!
And if they're all there?
Then someone forged an entry in the data banks.
Gorkon's daughter has been named Chancellor.
It was on the news.
I'll bet that bitch killed her father.
- Her own father?
- It is an old story, sir.
They don't place the same value on life as we do, you know that.
Take my word, she did not shed one bloody tear.
Hardly conclusive, since Klingons have no tear-ducts.
Lieutenant, any response from Starfleet since our dispatch?
Yes, sir.
And?
Commander Uhura is experiencing technical difficulties, sir.
Curious.
Very well.
For 24 hours, we will agree this conversation didn't take place.
- A lie?
- An omission.
In 24 hours we won't have a clue where Captain Kirk is.
- I know precisely where he will be.
- You do?
Where?
Kirk, Kirk, Kirk, Kirk...
It's a damn show trial.
The Enterprise fired on Kronos One without provocation.
The Chancellor and his advisors having been lulled into a false sense of security by an invitation to a dinner aboard Captain Kirk's vessel at precisely 19:30 hours that same evening.
Call your first witness.
After the first shot we lost our gravitational field.
I was weightless and couldn't function.
Then two Starfleet crewmen came towards me.
Or perhaps they merely wore Starfleet uniforms.
That remark is speculative.
I move that it be stricken.
We're interested in facts, not theories.
If the gravitational unit was not functioning, how could they walk?
They appeared to be wearing magnetic boots.
- Gravity boots...?
- Dr. McCoy.
Would you be so good as to tell me what is your current medical status?
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
You have a singular wit, Doctor.
For 27 years I've been surgeon aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.
In three months I stand down.
You know...
I believe that you consumed rather a generous amount of Romulan ale in the officers mess on the night in question.
- Objection.
- Sustained.
We all did.
All of us.
That doesn't mean...
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
Barely.
Now be careful, Doctor.
Have you ever in your past saved patients as barely alive as he?
I didn't have the medical knowledge I needed for Klingon anatomy.
- I see.
- You where there.
You say you are due for retirement.
May I ask, do your hands shake?
- Objection!
- I was nervous.
No.
You were incompetent.
You were incompetent!
Whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink.
- The court will have to determine.
- My God, man.
I tried to save him!
I tried to save him.
I was desperate to save him.
He was the last best hope in the Universe for peace.
The witness is excused.
There we have it, citizens.
We have established the particulars of the crime.
And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair.
James Tiberius Kirk.
What would your favourite author say, Captain?
"Let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings."
Tell us your sad story, Kirk.
Tell us that you planned to take revenge for the death of your son.
- That's not true.
- Objection!
Captain Kirk has not been identified as the assassin.
I offer into the record this excerpt from the Captain's personal log.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I've never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Again!
Again!
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I've never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Are those your words?
Those words were spoken by me.
Objection!
My client's political views are not on trial.
On the contrary.
Captain Kirk's views are at the very heart of the matter.
His record shows him to be an insubordinate, unprincipled opportunist with a history of violating the chain of command whenever it suited him.
Continue.
The record shows that Captain Kirk once held the rank of Admiral and he was broken for taking matters into his own hands.
Do you deny being demoted for these charges.
Answer me now!
- I cannot deny it.
- You were demoted?
- For insubordination?
- On occasion, I have disobeyed orders.
Were you obeying or disobeying orders when you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?
I didn't know about it until we boarded the ship.
You still deny the Enterprise fired on Kronos One?
And you still deny your men beamed aboard and shot the Chancellor?
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I didn't witness.
Are you aware that as the captain of a ship, you are responsible for the actions of your men?
I am.
If it's proved that members of your crew carried out the assassination...
- They're setting us up.
Your Honours!
- Do not answer.
Captain Kirk, you will answer the question.
As Captain I'm responsible for the crew under my command.
Your Honours, the state rests.
Send to Commander Enterprise.
"We stand ready to assist you.
Captain Sulu, U.S.S. Excelsior."
It is the determination of this court that the prisoners are guilty as charged.
I wish to note for the record that all the evidence is circumstantial.
I beg the court to consider this when pronouncing its sentence.
So noted.
Captain James T. Kirk, Dr. Leonard McCoy.
In the interest of fostering amity for the forthcoming peace talks, the sentence of death is commuted.
It is the judgement of this court that, without possibility of reprieve or parole, you be taken from this place to the dilithium mines on the penal asteroid of Rura Penthe.
There to spend the rest of your natural lives.
Rura Penthe!
Known throughout the galaxy as the alien's graveyard.
Better to kill them now and get it over with.
Lieutenant.
The torpedo hit once again, please.
Hold.
It is Enterprise.
We fired.
That is not possible!
All weapons visually accounted for, sir.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains must be the truth.
What does that mean?
That if we cannot have fired those torpedoes, someone else did.
They didn't fire on themselves and there are no other ships present.
- There was a neutron surge.
- Not from us.
A neutron surge that big could only be produced by another ship.
- Kronos One?
- Too far away.
Very near us.
Possibly beneath us.
If there were a ship beneath us, the Klingons would have seen it.
Would they?
- A Bird of Prey?
- A Bird of Prey.
- Cloaked?
- They can't fired when they're cloaked.
All things being equal, I would agree.
However, things are not equal.
This one can.
- We must inform Starfleet Command.
- Of what?
A new weapon that's invisible?
They'll call us raving lunatics.
They'll say we'll say anything to exonerate the Captain.
And they would be correct.
We have no evidence.
Only a theory which happens to fit the facts.
Assuming you're right.
Why would they fire on their own President?
Indeed.
This ship will be searched from bow to stern.
I do not understand.
If there was a ship underneath us surely the assassins beamed aboard from that vessel, not Enterprise.
You're forgetting something, Mr Chekov.
According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
If we did, the killers are here.
If we did not, whoever altered the data banks is here.
In either case, what we are looking for is here.
- What are we looking for, sir?
- Lieutenant.
Two pairs of gravity boots.
This is the gulag Rura Penthe.
There is no stockades, no guard tower, no electronic frontier.
Only a magnetic shield prevents beaming.
Punishment means exile from prison to the surface.
On the surface, nothing can survive.
Work well, and you will be treated well.
Work badly, and you will die.
Oh, my God!
The universal translator has been confiscated.
I'm sorry...?
He's definitely on about something, Jim.
If this is your spot, we'll move on.
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
- He's got it.
- And your coat.
I'm afraid not.
It wouldn't fit.
- Thanks.
- This will help keep you warm.
- I'm Martia.
You're Kirk and McCoy.
- How did you know that?
We don't get many presidential assassins.
- We didn't kill Gorkon.
- Of course not.
- But there's a reward for your death.
- That figures.
We've been set up.
Somebody up there wants you out of the way.
- Any progress?
- None.
A crew of 300 are looking everywhere, but the killers may still be among them.
Surely they have disposed of these boots by now.
Would it not have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
Logic must give way to physics.
Gravity wasn't restored when they escaped.
Without the boots, they would have floated off the transporter pads.
Why not simply vaporize them?
Like this?
As you know, no one can fire an unauthorized phaser aboard a starship.
Suppose, when they returned, they threw the boots into the refuse.
I'm having the refuse searched.
If I'm correct, those boots will cling to the killer's necks like Tiberian bats.
They couldn't escape without them nor throw them out the window.
Those boots are here.
Somewhere.
- Did someone fire off a phaser?
- It's alright.
It's nothing.
Mr Spock, Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
- Who fired the...
- Ah, Mr Scott.
I hear you have difficulty with the warp drive.
How long do you need for repair?
There's nothing wrong with the bloody thing.
If we return to space dock, the killers can dispose of their footwear and we will never see the Captain or Dr. McCoy alive again.
- It could take weeks.
- Thank you.
Val'eris, inform Starfleet our warp drive is inoperative.
- A lie?
- An error.
We have lost all contact with the Captain and Dr. McCoy.
Yes, at the moment they're surrounded by a magnetic shield.
But if I know the Captain, he is deep into planning his escape.
You've got him where you want him, Jim!
- Are you alright?
- I think so.
- They'll respect you now.
- I was lucky that thing had knees.
That was not his knee.
Not everybody keep their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Anything you want to tell me?
See what you can do for him.
Let him know we're not holding a grudge.
Suppose he's holding a grudge?
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
- Do you want to get out of here?
- There's got to be a way.
Three months before retirement.
What a way to finish.
- We're not finished.
- Speak for yourself.
One day, one night...
Kobayashi Maru!
Bones!
Are you afraid of the future?
I believe that was the general idea that I was trying to convey.
- I don't mean this future.
- What is this - multiple choice?
Some people are afraid...
of what might happen.
- I was terrified.
- What terrified you, specifically?
No more neutral zone.
I was used to hating Klingons.
It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his words.
- Spock was right.
- We all felt exactly the same.
No.
Somebody felt a lot worse.
I'm beginning to understand why.
If you've got any bright ideas, now is the time.
Time is the problem.
You and I are nothing.
You heard the judge - the peace conference is on again.
Whoever killed Gorkon is bound to attempt another assassination.
Unless we can get out of here.
It's me
- Martia.
Listen.
No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
- Except us.
- It is possible.
I know how to get outside the shield.
- How do we fit in?
- Getting outside the shield is easy.
After that, you have to get us off the surface before we freeze.
Can you?
- It's possible.
- I can't make it alone.
You're the likeliest candidate to come here for months.
Candidate for what?
Go to lift 7 in the morning for mining duty.
I'll see you there.
Don't disappoint me.
- What is it with you, anyway?
- Still think we're finished?
More than ever.
Sorry to wake you, sir.
Starfleet requests any data we have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
What?
They're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to space dock, sir.
Signal Starfleet that we have no idea location Enterprise.
- Sir?
- You have hearing problems?
No, sir.
Klingon blood.
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
This is the first evidence which corroborates our theory.
Now we go to Starfleet?
We expand our search to include uniforms.
All uniforms?
Clear, sir.
Make a hole.
Coming through.
Coming through.
Sir!
Sir!
- I think we've been had.
- No, you weren't, Doctor.
Get off at the first level.
Follow the gang into the mine.
They don't take girls.
- You are crewman Dax?
- Yes.
What is the problem?
Perhaps you know Russian epic of Cinderella?
If shoe fits - wear it.
Mr Chekov...
Watch me.
What kind of creature is this?
Last night you two were...
Get in.
Come on.
We don't have a lot of time.
Hurry!
Up there.
Come on - climb!
Here, you'll need these.
Quickly!
Stay close.
- There they are.
- They emerge from the beaming shield.
Mr Scott, start your engines.
Mr Chekov, set course for Rura Penthe.
Mr Spock, Rura Penthe is deep inside the Klingon frontier.
- If we're discovered...
- Correct.
We need a feat of linguistic legerdemain and intrepidity before the Captain and Dr. McCoy freeze to death.
- Leave me, I'm finished.
- No!
Bones, I'm wearing a viridium patch on my back.
Spock slapped it there before we went on Gorkon's ship.
That cunning little Vulcan.
Come on!
We're in the clear.
Now that we're outside the shield, they can locate us two sectors away.
If they're even looking for us.
This is listening post Morska.
What ship is that, over?
We must respond.
A universal translator would be recognised.
We am thy freighter...
Ursva.
Six weeks out of Kronos.
"What is your destination, over? "
We is condemning food things and supplies.
Don't catch any bugs.
Would you mind explaining that little trick you do?
- I'm a Chameloid.
- I've heard about you.
Shape-shifters.
I thought you were mythical.
Give a girl a chance, Captain.
It takes a lot of effort.
I don't doubt it.
Stop me if I'm wrong, but do we have any way of knowing whether this is the real you?
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.
We're outside the shield.
Now it's your turn, Captain.
If you say so.
Are you crazy?
!
She didn't need our help.
Where did you get these convenient clothes?
Don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue.
It's to let them know where we are.
Ask her what she's getting in return.
A full pardon... which doesn't cover this.
An accident wasn't good enough.
Come on, Spock.
Good enough for one.
Two would have looked suspicious.
Killed while attempting escape.
That's convincing for both.
Surprise!
- Your friends are late.
- They'll be along.
- I can't believe I kissed you.
- Must have been your lifelong ambition.
Isn't it time you became something else?
I like it here.
Well, well, well...
What took you so long?
Kill him, he's the one.
Not me, you idiot - him!
- No witnesses.
- Killed while trying to escape.
- Damned clever, if you ask me.
- It's a classic.
- That's what he wanted.
- Who?
Who wanted us killed?
Since you're all going to die anyway, why not tell you?
His name is...
Damn it!
What the hell!
Son of a...!
Couldn't you have waited two seconds?
He was about to explain the whole thing.
- You want to go back?
- Absolutely not!
This is the bridge.
We're still in Klingon space.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
They were beamed aboard a Federation Starship.
I could trace...
Escaped.
Kirk cannot know the location of the peace conference.
Are you sure?
Will you take that chance?
Helmsman, make course to intercept Enterprise.
The Klingons have a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked.
- She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
- So that's it.
We believe that Gorkon's murderers are aboard this ship.
- Has the peace conference begun?
- Who knows?
The location is secret.
- There's always something.
- Captain!
Mr Spock!
I found the uniforms with the Klingon blood on them.
But the uniforms belong to these two men.
Burke and Samno.
Not anymore.
Phaser on "stun" at close range.
First rule of assassination - kill the assassins.
- Now we're back to square one.
- Can I talk to you?
- Why weren't they vaporized?
- It would set off the alarm.
It's possible.
Now hear this.
Now hear this.
Court reporter to sick bay.
Code blue - urgent.
Statements to be taken at once from Yeomen Burke and Samno.
Repeat, court reporter to sick bay.
Code blue - urgent.
Statements to be taken.
Repeat, statements to be taken from Yeomen Burke and Samno.
You have to shoot.
If you are logical, you have to shoot.
- I do not want to.
- What you want is irrelevant.
What you've chosen is at hand.
I'd just as soon you didn't.
The operation is over.
I did not fire.
You cannot prove anything.
Yes, I can.
At my trial my personal log was used against me.
How long did you wait outside my quarters before I noticed you?
You knew?
I tried to tell you, but you would not listen.
Neither of us was hearing very well that night.
There were things I tried to tell you, about having faith.
You have betrayed the Federation.
All of you.
- And what have you've been doing?
- Saving Starfleet.
Klingons cannot be trusted.
Sir...
You said so yourself.
They killed your son.
Did you not wish Gorkon dead?
"Let them die", you said.
Did I misinterpret you?
And you were right.
They conspired with us to assassinate their own Chancellor.
How trustworthy can they be?
Klingons and Federation members conspiring together.
- Who is "us"?
- All who stands to lose from peace.
Names, Lieutenant.
My comrades will make certain all your transmissions are jammed.
- Names, Lieutenant!
- I do not remember.
A lie?
A choice.
Spock.
Admiral Cartwright.
From Starfleet?
Who else?
General...
Chang.
- Who else?
- Romulan Ambassador and others.
Where is the peace conference?
Where is the peace conference?
She does not know.
Then we're dead.
I have been dead before.
Contact Excelsior.
- She'll have the co-ordinates.
- I've already got it, sir.
- Standing by, Captain Kirk.
- Sulu.
You realize that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations.
I'm sorry, Captain.
Yourmessage is breaking up.
Bless you, Sulu.
Where is the peace conference?
They'll attempt another assassination.
It's at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border.
I'm sending the co-ordinates on a coded frequency.
We'll need more than that.
There's a Bird of Prey on the look-out for us that can fire when cloaked.
Surely not.
How many of those things are there?
Come on, Lieutenant.
- Just the prototype.
- Do you hear that?
I'm getting under way now.
We're in Alpha Quadrant.
The chances of our reaching the conference in time are slim.
- When does this conference start?
- According to my information - today.
- Thank you, Captain Sulu.
- Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
Spock?
I prefer it dark.
- Dining on ashes?
- You were right.
It was arrogant presumption on my part that got us into this situation.
You and the Doctor might have been killed.
The night is young.
You said it yourself, it was logical.
Peace is worth a few personal risks.
You're a great one for logic.
I'm a great one for rushing in where angels fear to tread.
We're both extremists.
Reality is probably somewhere in between.
I couldn't get past the death of my son.
I was prejudiced by her accomplishments as a Vulcan.
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was.
Is it possible that we two, you and I, have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?
Would that constitute a joke?
- It wasn't your fault.
- I was responsible.
- For no actions but your own.
- That's not what you said at your trial.
That was as captain of the ship.
Human beings...
We both know that I am not human.
Do you want to know something?
Everybody's human.
I find that remark... insulting.
Come, I need you.
Madam Chancellor, members of the diplomatic corps honoured guests.
The United Federation of Planets welcomes you to Camp Khitomer.
She's out here somewhere.
- But if she's cloaked...
- Then all we have is a radiation surge.
By the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes.
2.06... 2.03...
- Close enough to beam down?
- Not yet.
In two minutes. 1 .58.
Go to impulse power for Khitomer.
Let us redefine progress to mean that just because we can do a thing it does not necessarily follow that we must do that thing.
- Uhura?
- Nothing, Captain.
If she's here, she's rigged for silent running.
Coming up on transporter range in 57 seconds.
Transporter room.
Stand by to beam down.
53... 48 seconds.
44...
I can see you, Kirk.
Chang.
Can you see me?
Now be honest, Captain.
Warrior to warrior.
You do prefer it this way, don't you?
As it was meant to be.
No peace in our time.
"Once more unto the breach, dearfriends. "
- This is fun.
- Reverse engines.
All astern.
One and a half impulse power.
Back off!
What's she doing?
What's she waiting for?
Probably attempting to ascertain why we are reversing.
Wondering whether we detect her.
Incoming!
- In range?
- Not yet, sir.
Come on!
- She'll fly apart.
- Fly her apart, then!
Many speculated about my father's motives.
Some said he was an idealist.
Others said he had no choice.
If Praxis had not exploded, his idealism wouldn't have found expression.
We are a proud race.
We are here because we intend to go on being proud.
- Go to auxiliary power!
- Auxiliary circuits destroyed.
"Tickle us, do we not laugh?
Prick us, do we not bleed?"
"Wrong us, shall we not revenge?"
Gas.
Gas, Captain.
Under impulse power she expands fuel, like all vessels.
We call it "plasma", but it is merely ionised gas.
What about our equipment to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
The thing's got to have a tail-pipe.
Doctor, would you assist me in performing surgery on a torpedo?
Fascinating.
Hard to starboard.
The proposed agenda is as follows:
The evacuation of Kronos has been calculated within the 50 Earth year time span.
Phase 1 - preparation for evacuation...
Captain, she's packing quite a wallop.
Shields weakening.
Shields up!
Alright, now we're giving them something else to shoot at.
The game's afoot.
- Excelsior's been hit!
- "Our revels now are ended", Kirk.
"Cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war."
- Bones, where's my torpedo?
- Bet you wished you'd stayed in bed.
Shields collapsing!
The key, please.
Time is short.
- The hull has been compromised.
- I wonder how bad.
Connect echo-bars.
...discuss the report on phase 2.
- Alter circuit A.
- Sensor.
...we commence within minutes of the preparation.
- "I am constant as the Northern star."
- I'd give real money, if he'd shut up.
Plate, please.
...and assimilation will consume...
We've got a heart beat.
...with the Klingon Empire...
Key, please.
- Where's that torpedo?
- She's ready.
Lock and load!
Fire!
"To be... or not" "to be."
Target that explosion and fire.
Fire!
This work will occupy us throughout most of the week.
I hope that the delegation can implement the provisions of Phase 1 by the first of next month.
As you know, time is of the essence.
Out of the way!
Mr President!
Mr President!
Kirk, Enterprise.
Protect the Chancellor!
- Arrest those men!
- Arrest yourself!
We've got a full confession.
- This is not Klingon blood.
- Cartwright.
Just a minute.
It's Colonel West!
What's happened?
What's the mean of all of this?
It's about the future, Madam Chancellor.
Some people think the future means the end of history.
We haven't run out of history quite yet.
Your father called the future "the undiscovered country".
People can be very frightened of change.
You've restored my father's faith.
And you've restored my son's.
Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
And they're not going to prosecute.
They could have prosecuted me.
I felt like Val'eris.
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
And it's a good thing, too.
If they did, we'd all have to turn ourselves in.
- Captain Kirk.
- Captain Sulu.
As much to the crew of the Enterprise, I owe you my thanks.
Nice to see you in action one more time, Captain Kirk.
Take care.
- My God, that's a big ship.
- Not so big as her captain.
So...
This is goodbye?
It's about time we got underway ourselves.
Captain, I have orders from Starfleet Command.
We're to put back to space dock immediately... to be decommissioned.
If I were human, I believe my response would be:
"Go to hell."
If I were human.
Course heading, Captain?
Second star to the right.
And straight on 'til morning.
Captain's log, stardate 9529. 1.
This is the final cruise of the Starship Enterprise under my command.
This ship, and her history will shortly become the care of another crew.
To them and their posterity will we commit our future.
They'll continue the voyages we have begun and journey to all the undiscovered countries boldly going where no man, where no one has gone before.
Stardate 9521.6.
Captain's Log, U.S.S. Excelsior.
Hikaru Sulu commanding.
After three years,
I've concluded my first assignment as master of this vessel, cataloguing gaseous planetary anomalies in Beta Quadrant.
We're heading home under full impulse power.
I am pleased to report that ship and crew have functioned well.
According to this, we've completed our survey of the entire sector.
I have an energy wave at 240 degrees mark 6 port, sir.
Visual.
My God.
Shields.
Shields!
She's not answering her helm.
Starboard thruster.
Turn her into the wave.
Aye.
Quarter impulse power.
Damage report.
Checking all systems, Captain.
Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
Negative, sir.
The subspace shockwave originated at bearing 3-2-3 mark 75.
Location...
It's Praxis, sir.
It's a Klingon moon.
Praxis is their key energy production facility.
Send to Klingon High Command.
"This is Excelsior, a Federation starship.
"We have monitored a large explosion in your sector.
"Do you require assistance?"
-Aye, sir.
-Mr.
Valtane, any more data?
Yes, sir.
I've confirmed the location of Praxis, but...
What is it?
I cannot confirm the existence of Praxis.
Onscreen.
Magnify.
Computer enhancement.
-Praxis?
-What's left of it, sir.
Captain, I'm getting a message from Praxis.
Let's have it.
This is Brigadier Kerla speaking for the High Command.
There has been an incident on Praxis.
However, everything is under control.
We have no need for assistance.
Obey treaty stipulations and remain outside the neutral zone.
This transmission ends now.
"An incident"?
-Do we report this, sir?
-Are you kidding?
What are we doing here?
Maybe they're throwing us a retirement party.
-That suits me.
I just bought a boat.
-This had better be good.
I'm supposed to be chairing a seminar at the Academy.
Captain, isn't this just for top brass?
If we're all here, where's Sulu?
Captain Sulu.
On assignment.
Where's Spock?
This briefing is classified.
Ladies and gentlemen, the CinC.
As you were.
To break this information down succinctly, the Klingon Empire has roughly 50 years of life left to it.
For full details, I'm turning this briefing over to the Federation's special envoy.
Good morning.
Two months ago, a Federation starship monitored an explosion on the Klingon moon Praxis.
We believe it was caused by over-mining and insufficient safety precautions.
The moon's decimation means the deadly pollution of their ozone.
They will have depleted their supply of oxygen in approximately 50 Earth years.
Due to their enormous military budget, the Klingon economy does not have the resources with which to combat this catastrophe.
Last month, at the behest of the Vulcan ambassador,
I opened a dialogue with Gorkon, Chancellor of the Klingon High Council.
He proposes to commence negotiations at once.
Negotiations for what?
The dismantling of our space stations and starbases along the neutral zone, an end to almost 70 years of unremitting hostility, which the Klingons can no longer afford.
Bill, are we talking about mothballing the Starfleet?
Well, I'm sure that our exploration and scientific programs
-would be unaffected, Captain, but...
-I must protest.
To offer Klingons safe haven within Federation space is suicide.
Klingons would become the alien trash of the galaxy, and if we dismantle the fleet, we'd be defenseless before an aggressive species with a foothold on our territory.
The opportunity here is to bring them to their knees.
Then we'll be in a far better position to dictate terms.
Sir?
Captain Kirk.
The Klingons have never been trustworthy.
I'm forced to agree with Admiral Cartwright.
This is a terrifying idea.
It is imperative that we act now to support the Gorkon initiative lest more conservative elements persuade his empire that it is better to attempt a military solution and die fighting.
You, Captain Kirk, are to be our first olive branch.
We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon vessel which is bringing Chancellor Gorkon to Earth and to escort him safely through Federation space.
Me?
Well, there are Klingons who feel the same way about the peace treaty as yourself and Admiral Cartwright, but they'll think twice about attacking the Enterprise under your command.
I have personally vouched for you in this matter, Captain.
You have personally vouched?
You will extend Chancellor Gorkon full diplomatic courtesy, Captain Kirk.
But a full ambassador would be better equipped...
If there's no further business,
I wish you and your crew Godspeed.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
I remind you, this meeting is classified.
I don't know whether to congratulate you or not, Jim.
I wouldn't.
We volunteered?
There is an old Vulcan proverb, "Only Nixon could go to China."
How could you vouch for me?
That's arrogant presumption.
My father requested that I open negotiations...
I know your father's the Vulcan ambassador, for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this.
They're animals.
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here.
Don't believe them.
Don't trust them.
-They are dying.
-Let them die.
Has it occurred to you that this crew is due to stand down in three months?
We've done our bit for king and country.
You should have trusted me.
Control, this is SD-103, approach to spacedock.
Over.
SD-103, you are clear to deliver Captain Kirk and party to NCC-1701 Alpha.
Over.
Captain on the Bridge.
-As you were, Lieutenant...
-Valeris, sir.
We were told that you needed a helmsman, so I volunteered.
Lieutenant, it is agreeable to see you again.
Lieutenant was the first Vulcan to be graduated
-at the top of her class at the academy.
-You must be very proud.
I don't believe so, sir.
She's a Vulcan, all right.
Let's get this over with.
Departure stations.
-Scotty.
-Aye, sir?
Did you find the engine room?
Right where I left it, sir.
Standby.
Uhura, get me the dockmaster.
Control tower reading, sir.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
This is Control, Enterprise.
Permission to depart granted.
Thirty seconds for port gates.
Clear all moorings.
Awaiting port gates from this mark.
All moorings clear.
Aft thrusters.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
One-quarter impulse power.
Captain, may I remind you that regulations specify thrusters only while in spacedock?
Jim?
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
Aye, sir.
Captain's Log, Stardate 9522.6.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I could never forgive them for the death of my boy.
It seems to me our mission to escort the Chancellor of the Klingon High Council to a peace summit is problematic at best.
Spock says this could be an historic occasion, and I'd like to believe him, but how on earth can history get past people like me?
Sorry.
You could have knocked.
We are almost at the rendezvous, sir.
I thought that you would like to know.
Right.
Permission to speak freely, sir.
It is an honor to serve with you.
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant.
I've always wanted to try that, sir.
You've done well, Valeris.
As your sponsor at the academy,
I have followed your career with satisfaction, and as a Vulcan, you've exceeded my expectations.
I do not understand this representation.
It is a depiction from ancient Earth mythology, the expulsion from Paradise.
Why keep it in your quarters?
It is a reminder to me that all things end.
It is of endings that I wish to speak.
Sir, I address you as a kindred intellect.
Do you not recognize that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
History is replete with turning points, Lieutenant.
-You must have faith.
-Faith?
That the universe will unfold as it should.
-But is that logical?
Surely we must...
-Logic, logic and logic.
Logic is the beginning of wisdom, Valeris, not the end.
This will be my final voyage onboard this vessel as a member of her crew.
Nature abhors a vacuum.
I intend you to replace me.
I could only succeed you, sir.
Now hear this.
All officers to the Bridge.
Klingon battle cruiser off the port bow.
All officers to the Bridge.
Captain on the Bridge.
Shall we raise our shields, Captain?
Never been this close.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
-Uhura, hailing frequencies.
-Aye, sir.
Right standard rudder.
Bring us alongside.
Right standard rudder.
Z plus 5 degrees.
Channel is open, Captain.
This is the Starship Enterprise,
Captain James T. Kirk commanding.
This is Kronos One.
I am Chancellor Gorkon.
Chancellor, we've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting on Earth.
Thank you, Captain.
Would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard the Enterprise with my officers, as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We would be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1930 hours.
I shall look forward to that.
-Well, I hope you're happy.
-Captain, there is a supply of Romulan ale aboard.
It might make the evening pass more smoothly.
Officer thinking, Lieutenant.
Guess who's coming to dinner.
Energize.
-Chancellor Gorkon.
-Captain Kirk.
May I present Captain Spock, whom I believe you know.
Captain, face to face at last.
-You have my thanks.
-Chancellor.
Gentlemen, this is my daughter Azetbur,
my military adviser, Brigadier Kerla, and this is General Chang, my chief of staff.
I have so wanted to meet you, Captain.
I'm not sure how to take that.
Sincere admiration, Kirk.
From one warrior to another.
Right.
This way.
I think you might enjoy a brief tour.
-They all look alike.
-What about that smell?
You know only top-of-the-line models can even talk...
You men have work?
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.
Then snap to it.
I offer a toast.
"The undiscover'd country,"
the future.
-"The undiscover'd country." -"The undiscover'd country."
Hamlet, Act III, Scene 1.
You've not experienced Shakespeare until you have read him in the original Klingon.
Captain Kirk, I thought Romulan ale was illegal.
One of the advantages of being 1,000 light-years from Federation Headquarters.
To you, Chancellor Gorkon, one of the architects of our future.
-Chancellor.
-Chancellor.
Perhaps we are looking at something of that future here.
Tell me, Captain Kirk, would you be willing to give up Starfleet?
I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace.
Far be it for me to dispute my first officer, but Starfleet has always been at the fore...
Captain, there's no need to mince words.
In space, all warriors are cold warriors.
General, are you fond of
Shakespeare?
We do believe all planets have a sovereign claim to inalienable human rights.
Inalien?
If you could only hear yourselves.
"Human rights."
Why, the very name is racist.
The Federation is no more than a "Homo Sapiens Only" club.
Present company excepted, of course.
In any case, we know where this is leading.
-The annihilation of our culture.
-That's not true.
-No?
-No.
"To be, or not to be."
That is the question which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk.
-We need breathing room.
-Earth, Hitler, 1938.
I beg your pardon?
Well...
I see we have a long way to go.
We must do this again sometime.
You don't trust me, do you?
I don't blame you.
If there is to be a brave new world, our generation is going to have the hardest time living in it.
Captain Spock.
Chancellor.
-Madam.
-Captain.
Well, most kind.
"Parting is such sweet sorrow," Captain.
Have we not "heard the chimes at midnight"?
Thank God.
Did you see the way they ate?
Terrible table manners.
I doubt that our own behavior will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy.
I'm going to sleep this off.
Please let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight.
I'm going to go find a pot of black coffee.
The Enterprise hosted Chancellor Gorkon and company to dinner last night.
Our manners weren't exactly Emily Post.
Note to the galley,
Romulan ale no longer to be served at diplomatic functions.
Captain Kirk, will you please join me on the Bridge?
Captain Kirk?
-Captain.
-What is it?
I find this curious.
Spock, I'm really tired.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
Where?
Strangely enough, it appears to be emanating from us.
The Enterprise?
Valeris, do you know anything about a radiation surge?
Sir?
Chekov?
Only the size of my head.
I know what you mean.
-What's happened?
-We have fired on the Chancellor's ship.
Torpedo Room, please confirm.
Have we fired?
...0-6...
-Uhura, monitor.
-Aye, sir.
Direct hit.
Confirmed, sir.
We've lost gravity!
We are betrayed!
This is the Bridge.
Do you read?
Do you read?
Torpedo bay, did we fire those torpedoes?
Negative, Captain.
According to inventory, we're still fully loaded.
Find Chang.
Unable to confirm or deny firing of two photon torpedoes.
-Hailing frequencies.
-Aye, sir.
Kronos One, this is Enterprise.
Do you read?
Over.
Repeat.
Kronos One...
It's very hard to make out, Captain.
There's been some weapons firing and a lot of shouting.
She is still listing.
She's spinning out of control.
Restoring auxiliary gravity.
Have you not a shred of decency in you, Kirk?
We come in peace, and you blatantly defile that peace.
For that, I shall blow you out of the stars.
-We haven't fired.
-Captain.
According to our databanks, we have, twice.
Captain, they're coming about.
-They're preparing to fire.
-Shields up, Captain?
-Captain, our shields.
-Shields up, Captain?
-Signal our surrender.
-Captain?
We surrender!
-This is Enterprise.
We surrender.
-If they fire at us
-with our shields down...
-I repeat.
-We surrender.
-...we will not be able to respond.
Repeat.
Enterprise surrenders.
-Are we firing torpedoes?
-I wish I knew.
Well, it sure looks like it.
I'm going aboard.
Spock, you have the conn.
I am responsible for involving you in this.
I will go.
No, I'll go.
You'll be responsible for getting me out of this.
We'll not be the instigators of full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
I'm going, too.
They may need a doctor.
-Perhaps you're right.
-Uhura, tell them we're coming, and tell them we're unarmed.
Aye, sir.
Have you lost your mind?
I give you my word, I don't understand what has happened.
We're here to help.
Follow me.
-Chancellor Gorkon.
-My God.
-What has happened here?
-You dare to feign ignorance?
-What happened?
-With a direct torpedo hit, you crippled our entire gravitational field, and two of your Starfleet crew beamed aboard wearing magnetic boots and did this.
Aren't you carrying a surgeon?
We were until this disgrace.
Well, then for God sakes, man, let me help.
I've got a pulse.
We can move him.
I'm gonna need some light.
Can we get him up on this table?
Hold him.
Hold him while I stabilize him.
I said hold him.
Sweet Jesus.
-Can you...
-Jim, I don't even know his anatomy.
-His wounds are not closing.
-He's killing him!
He's gone into some kind of damned arrest.
Come on, damn it!
Come on!
He's not responding.
Don't let it end this way, Captain.
Under article number 184 of your interstellar law,
I'm placing you under arrest.
You are charged with assassinating our Chancellor of the High Council.
He tried to save him.
They've been arrested.
Mr. Spock, we've got to do something.
I assume command of this ship as of 0230 hours.
Commander Uhura, please notify Starfleet Headquarters.
Tell them precisely what has taken place
-and request instructions.
-Aye, sir.
We cannot allow them to be taken back to Kronos as prisoners.
What do you suggest, Lieutenant?
Opening fire will not retrieve them, and an armed conflict is precisely what the Captain wished to avoid.
We will be able to follow the Captain's movements.
-How did you achieve this, sir?
-Time is precious, Lieutenant.
We must endeavor to piece together what happened here tonight.
According to our databank, this ship fired those torpedoes.
No way.
I sympathize, Mr. Scott, but we need evidence.
Please accompany me.
And if we cannot piece together what happened?
-What then, sir?
-In that case, Mr. Chekov, it resides in the purview of the diplomats.
The Chancellor of the High Council is dead!
The result of an unprovoked attack while he travelled to see you under a flag of truce, on a mission of peace.
Captain Kirk was legally arrested for the crime.
May I remind you that he and Dr McCoy boarded Kronos One of their own free will?
None of these facts are in dispute, Mr. President.
I have ordered a full-scale investigation.
-In the meantime...
-In the meantime, we expect the Federation to abide by the articles of interstellar law, which you claim to cherish.
Kirk and Dr McCoy will stand trial for the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon.
Out of the question.
Ambassador Sarek, there must be some way to extradite these men.
Mr. President, I share a measure of personal responsibility in this matter, but I am obliged to confirm my esteemed colleague's legal interpretation.
What is the position of the Romulan government,
Ambassador Nanclus?
I must concur with my colleagues.
But you can't possibly believe that James Kirk assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council.
Mr. President, I don't know what to believe.
I'm waiting for your answer, sir.
This president is not above the law.
Report back at once.
Do you copy?
At once.
Enterprise to report back on the double.
Do you read?
At once.
We're to report back at once.
We cannot abandon Captain Kirk and Dr McCoy.
Of course not.
Four hundred years ago on the planet Earth, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by automation flung their wooden shoes called "sabot" into the machines to stop them.
Hence the word "sabotage."
We are experiencing technical malfunction.
All backup systems inoperative.
Excellent.
I mean, too bad.
Mr. President,
I've been named Chancellor by the High Council in my father's place.
Madam Chancellor, you have my sincerest condolences on your recent loss.
I want to assure you that this shameful deed will not...
Mr. President, let us come to the point.
You want this conference to go forward, and so did my father.
I will attend in one week on one condition.
We will not extradite the prisoners, and you will make no attempt to rescue them in a military operation.
We would consider any such attempt an act of war.
We hope you'll be our guest here on Earth.
After recent events, you will understand if I say I prefer a neutral site, and in the interests of security, let us keep the location secret for now.
As you wish, Madam Chancellor.
Attack them now, while we still can!
Attack or be slaves in their world.
We can take whole by force, what they propose to divide.
War is obsolete, General, as we are in danger of becoming.
Better to die on our feet than live on our knees.
That wasn't what my father wanted.
Your father was killed for what he wanted.
The peace process will go forward.
Kirk...
Kirk will pay for my father's death.
-Kirk!

The Enterprise fired on Kronos One without provocation.
The Chancellor and his advisers having been lulled into a false sense of security by an invitation to a state dinner aboard Captain Kirk's vessel at precisely 1930 hours that same evening.
Call your first witness.
After the first shot, we lost our gravitational field.
I found myself weightless and unable to function.
Then two Starfleet crewmen came walking towards me.
But perhaps they merely wore Starfleet uniforms.
That remark is purely speculative.
I move that it be stricken.
Colonel Worf, we are interested in facts, not theories.
If the gravitational unit was not functioning, how could these men be walking?
They appeared to be wearing magnetic boots.
Gravity boots.
Dr McCoy, would you be so good as to tell me, what is your current medical status?
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
You have a singular wit, Doctor.
For 27 years, I've been ship surgeon aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.
In three months, I stand down.
You know, I believe that you consumed a rather generous amount of Romulan ale in the officers' mess on the night in question.
Am I right, Doctor?
-Objection!
-Sustained.
We all did.
All of us.
-That doesn't mean...
-Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
-Barely.
-Now be careful, Doctor.
Have you ever, in your past, saved patients as barely alive as he?
I didn't have the medical knowledge I needed for Klingon anatomy.
-I see.
-You were there.
You say you are due for retirement.
May I ask, do your hands shake?
-Objection!
-I was nervous.
No.
You were incompetent.
You were incompetent!
Whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink,
-the court will have to determine.
-My God, man!
I tried to save him!
I tried to save him.
I was desperate to save him.
He was the last best hope in the universe for peace.
The witness is excused.
There we have it, citizens.
We have finally established the particulars of the crime, and now we come to the architect of this tragic affair,
James Tiberius Kirk.
What would your favorite author say, Captain?
"Let us sit upon the ground
"and tell sad stories of the death of kings."
Tell us your sad story, Kirk.
Tell us that you planned to take revenge for the death of your son.
-That's not true.
-Objection!
Captain Kirk has not been identified as the assassin.
Sustained.
I offer into the record this excerpt from the Captain's personal log.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I have never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Again.
Again!
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I have never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Are those your words?
Those words were spoken by me.
Objection!
My client's political views are not on trial here.
On the contrary!
Captain Kirk's views and motives are indeed at the very heart of the matter.
This officer's record shows him to be an insubordinate, unprincipled, career-minded opportunist, with a history of violating the chain of command whenever it suited him!
Continue.
Indeed, the record shows that Captain Kirk once held the rank of Admiral, and that Admiral Kirk was broken for taking matters into his own hands in defiance of regulations of the law.
Do you deny being demoted for these charges?
Don't wait for the translation!
Answer me now!
I cannot deny it.
-You were demoted?
-Yes.
-For insubordination?
-On occasion, I have disobeyed orders.
And were you obeying or disobeying orders when you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?
I didn't know about the assassination until we boarded the ship.
You still deny the Enterprise fired on Kronos One?
-Well...
-Your Honors, please!
And you still deny your men beamed aboard and shot the Chancellor?
Objection!
I cannot confirm or deny actions I did not witness.
Captain Kirk, are you aware that as the captain of a starship, you are required to be responsible for the actions of your men?
I am.
And if it should be proved that members of your crew did, in fact, carry out such an assassination...
Jim, they're setting us up.
Your Honors...
Do not answer!
Captain Kirk, you will answer the question.
As captain,
I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
Your Honors, the State rests.
Send to Commander Enterprise.
"We stand ready to assist you.
Captain Sulu, U.S.S. Excelsior. "
It is the determination of this court that the prisoners are guilty as charged.
I wish to note for the record that the evidence against my clients is entirely circumstantial.
I beg the court to consider this when pronouncing its sentence.
So noted.
Captain James T. Kirk, Dr Leonard McCoy, in the interest of fostering amity for the forthcoming peace talks, the sentence of death is commuted.
It is the judgment of this court that, without possibility of reprieve or parole, you be taken from this place to the dilithium mines on the penal asteroid of Rura Penthe, there to spend the rest of your natural lives.
Rura Penthe?
Known throughout the galaxy as the aliens' graveyard.
Better to kill them now and get it over with.
Lieutenant, the torpedo hit once again, please.
Hold.
It is Enterprise.
-We fired.
-That is not possible.
All weapons visually accounted for, sir.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.
What exactly does that mean?
It means that if we cannot have fired those torpedoes, someone else did.
Well, they did not fire on themselves, and there were no other ships present.
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
Not from us!
A neutron surge that big could only be produced by another ship.
Kronos One?
Too far away.
Very near us.
Possibly beneath us.
If there were a ship beneath us, the Klingons would have seen her.
Would they?
-A bird-of-prey.
-A bird-of-prey.
Cloaked?
A bird-of-prey cannot fire when she's cloaked.
All things being equal, Mr. Scott, I would agree.
However, things are not equal.
This one can.
We must inform Starfleet Command.
Inform them of what, a new weapon that is invisible?
Raving lunatics, that's what they'll call us.
They'll say that we're so desperate to exonerate the Captain that we'll say anything.
And they would be correct.
We have no evidence, only a theory which happens to fit the facts.
Assuming you're right, Mr. Spock, why would they fire on their own president?
Indeed.
This ship will be searched from bow to stern.
Lieutenant Valeris, you'll be in charge.
-Aye, sir.
-I do not understand.
If there was a ship underneath us, surely the assassins beamed aboard from that vessel, not Enterprise.
You're forgetting something, Mr. Chekov.
According to our databanks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
If we did, the killers are here.
If we did not, whoever altered the databanks is here.
In either case, what we are looking for is here.
What are we looking for, sir?
Lieutenant?
Two pairs of gravity boots.
This is the gulag Rura Penthe.
There is no stockade, no guard tower, no electronic frontier.
Only a magnetic shield prevents beaming.
Punishment means exile from prison to the surface.
On the surface, nothing can survive.
Work well and you will be treated well.
Work badly and you will die.
Oh, my God.
The universal translator's been confiscated.
I'm sorry?
He's definitely on about something, Jim.
If this is your spot, we'll move on.
He wants your obedience to the brotherhood of aliens.
-He's got it.
-And your coat.
I'm afraid not.
Besides, it wouldn't fit.
Thanks.
This will help keep you warm.
I'm Martia.
You're Kirk and McCoy, I presume.
How'd you know that?
We don't get many presidential assassins.
-We didn't kill Gorkon.
-Of course not,
-but there is a reward for your death.
-It figures.
We've been set up all along.
Somebody up there wants you out of the way.
-Nothing in here.
-Nothing here.
-Any progress?
-None.
We have a crew of 300 turning their own quarters inside out, but the killers may still be among them.
Surely they have disposed of these boots by now.
Would it not have been logical to have left them on Gorkon's ship?
Even logic must give way to physics.
Gravity had not been restored by the time they escaped.
Without the boots, they would have floated off the Klingon transporter pads.
Why not simply vaporize them?
Like this?
At ease.
As you know, Commander Chekov, no one can fire an unauthorized phaser aboard a starship.
Suppose when they returned, they threw the boots into the refuse.
I'm having the refuse searched.
If my surmise is correct, those boots will cling to the killers' necks like a pair of Tiberian bats.
They could not make their escape without them, nor can they simply throw them out the window for all to see.
-Those boots are here somewhere.
-Did someone fire off a phaser?
It's all right.
It's nothing.
It's nothing.
Mr. Spock, Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
-Who fired that...
-Mr.
Scott.
I understand you're having difficulty with the warp drive.
How much time do you require for repair?
There's nothing wrong with the bloody thing.
Mr. Scott, if we return to spacedock, the assassins will surely find a way to dispose of their incriminating footwear, and we will never see the Captain or Dr McCoy alive again.
-It could take weeks, sir.
-Thank you, Mr. Scott.
Valeris, please inform Starfleet Command
-our warp drive is inoperative.
-A lie?
An error.
You understand we have lost all contact with the Captain and Dr McCoy.
Yes.
At the moment, they're surrounded by a magnetic shield.
However, if I know the Captain, by this time, he is deep into planning his escape.
You got him, Jim!
You got him where you want him!
-You all right, Jim?
-I think so.
-They'll respect you now.
-That's a comfort.
-I was lucky that thing had knees.
-That was not his knee.
Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Anything you want to tell me?
Bones, why don't you see what you can do for him?
Let him know we're not holding a grudge.
Suppose he's holding a grudge?
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
-Do you want to get out of here?
-There's gotta be a way.
Three months before retirement.
What a way to finish.
-We're not finished.
-No?
Speak for yourself.
One day, one night, Kobayashi Maru.
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
I believe that was the general idea that I was trying to convey.
I don't mean this future.
-What is this, multiple choice?
-Some people are afraid of what might happen.
I was terrified.
What terrified you, specifically?
No more neutral zone.
I was used to hating Klingons.
It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word.
Spock was right.
Try not to be too hard on yourself.
We all felt exactly the same.
No.
Somebody felt a lot worse.
I'm beginning to understand why.
Well, if you've got any bright ideas, now's the time.
Time's the problem.
You and I are nothing.
But you heard the judge.
The peace conference is on again.
Whoever killed Gorkon is bound to attempt another assassination.
Unless we can get out of here.
Kirk, it's me, Martia.
Listen, no one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
-Except us.
-It is possible.
-I know how to get outside the shield.
-How do we fit in?
Getting outside the shield is easy, but after that, it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze.
Can you?
-It's possible.
-I can't make it alone, and you're likeliest candidate to come in this hellhole for months.
Candidate for what?
Go to lift seven in the morning for mining duty.
I'll see you there.
Don't disappoint me.
-What is it with you, anyway?
-Still think we're finished?
More than ever.
-I'm sorry to wake you, sir.
-What is it?
Starfleet urgently requests any data we have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
What?
Well, apparently, they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
Signal Starfleet that we have no idea location Enterprise.
Sir?
-You have hearing problems, mister?
-No, sir.
Klingon blood.
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
This is the first evidence which corroborates our theory.
Now we go to Starfleet.
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
All uniforms?
Take those out.
-Continue scanning.
-Nothing, sir.
Clear, sir.
Coming through.
Coming through.
Computer well seven clear.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Okay, let's see what we got.
Nothing.
Nothing so far.
Sir!
Sir!
-I think we've been had.
-No, you weren't, Doctor.
Get off at the first level.
Follow the gang into the mine.
They don't take girls.
You are Crewman Dax?
Yes, Commander.
What is the problem?
Perhaps you know Russian epic of Cinderella?
If shoe fits, wear it.
Mr. Chekov.
Watch me.
What kind of creature is this?
Last night, you two were...
Don't remind me.
Get in.
Come on.
We don't have a lot of time.
Hurry.
Up there.
Come on, climb.
Here.
You'll need these.
Quickly!
Stay close.
There they are.
They're emerging from the beaming shield.
-Mr.
Scott, start your engines.
-Aye, aye, sir.
Mr. Chekov, set course for Rura Penthe.
Mr. Spock, Rura Penthe is deep inside the Klingon frontier.
-If we are discovered...
-Quite correct, Mr. Chekov.
What is required now is a feat of linguistic legerdemain and a degree of intrepidity before the Captain and Dr McCoy freeze to death.
-Leave me.
I'm finished.
-No!
Bones, I'm wearing a viridium patch on my back.
Spock slapped it there just before we went on Gorkon's ship.
-Why, that cunning little Vulcan.
-Come on.
We're in the clear.
Now that we're outside the shield, they'll be able to locate us two sectors away.
If they're even looking for us.
This is listening post Morska.
What ship is that?
Over.
We must respond personally.
A universal translator would be recognized.
We am thy freighter Ursva.
Six weeks out of
Kronos.
What is your destination?
Over.
We is condemning food,
things and supplies.
Don't catch any bugs!
Would you mind explaining that little trick you do?
-I'm a chameloid.
-I've heard about you.
Shapeshifters.
-I thought you were mythical.
-Give a girl a chance, Captain.
-It takes a lot of effort.
-I don't doubt it.
Stop me if I'm wrong, but do we have any way of knowing whether this is the real you?
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.
We're outside the shield.
Now it's your turn, Captain.
If you say so.
Are you crazy?
She didn't need our help getting anywhere.
Where'd you get these convenient clothes?
Don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue.
It's to let them know where we are.
Ask her what she's getting in return.
A full pardon, which doesn't cover this.
An accident wasn't good enough.
Come on, Spock.
Good enough for one.
Two would have looked suspicious.
Killed while attempting escape.
Now that's convincing for both.
Surprise!
-Your friends are late.
-They'll be along.
-I can't believe I kissed you.
-Must have been your lifelong ambition.
Isn't it about time you became something else?
I like it here.
Well, well, well.
What took you so long?
-Kill him.
He's the one.
-Not me, you idiot.
Him!
-No witnesses.
-Killed while trying to escape.
-Damn clever, if you ask me.
-It's a classic.
-That's what he wanted.
-Who?
Who wanted us killed?
Since you're all going to die anyway, why not tell you?
His name is...
Damn it to hell!
Of all the...
Son of a...
-Couldn't you have waited two seconds?
-Captain?
He was just about to explain the whole thing.
You want to go back?
-Absolutely not!
-It's cold.
This is the Bridge.
We are still in Klingon space.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
They were beamed aboard a Federation starship.
I could trace...
Escaped.
Kirk cannot know the location of the peace conference.
Are you sure?
Will you take that chance?
Helmsman, make course to intercept Enterprise.
The Klingons have a new weapon, a bird-of-prey that can fire when cloaked.
-She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
-So that's it.
Not entirely.
I have reason to believe that Gorkon's murderers
-are aboard this vessel.
-I have a thought about that.
Has the peace conference begun?
Who knows?
They're keeping the location secret.
-There's always something.
-Captain!
Mr. Spock!
I found the missing uniforms with the Klingon blood on them.
But the uniforms belong to these two men,
Burke and Samno.
Not anymore.
Phaser on stun at close range.
First rule of assassination, kill the assassins.
-Now we're back to square one.
-Can I talk to you?
I wonder why they weren't vaporized.
It would set off the alarm.
It's possible.
Now hear this.
Now hear this.
Court reporter to sickbay.
Code Blue.
Urgent.
Statements to be taken at once from yeomen Burke and Samno.
Repeat.
Court reporter to sickbay.
Code Blue.
Urgent.
Statements to be taken.
Repeat.
Statements to be taken from yeomen Burke and Samno.
You have to shoot.
If you are logical, you have to shoot.
I do not want to.
What you want is irrelevant.
What you've chosen is at hand.
I'd just as soon you didn't.
The operation is over.
I did not fire.
You cannot prove anything.
Yes, I can.
At my trial, my personal log was used against me.
How long did you wait outside my quarters before I noticed you?
You knew?
I tried to tell you, but you would not listen.
Neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant.
There were things I tried to tell you about having faith.
You have betrayed the Federation.
All of you.
And what do you think you've been doing?
Saving Starfleet.
Klingons cannot be trusted.
Sir.
You said so yourself.
They killed your son.
Did you not wish Gorkon dead?
"Let them die," you said.
Did I misinterpret you?
And you were right.
They conspired with us to assassinate their own chancellor.
How trustworthy can they be?
Klingons and Federation members conspiring together?
Who is "us"?
Everyone who stands to lose from peace.
-Names, Lieutenant.
-My comrades will make certain all your ship-to-shore transmissions are jammed.
Names, Lieutenant.
I do not remember.
A lie?
A choice.
Spock?
Admiral Cartwright.
From Starfleet?
Who else?
-General...
-General...
-...
Chang.

Who else?
-Romulan...

Where is the peace conference?
Where is the peace conference?
She does not know.
Then we're dead.
I've been dead before.
Contact Excelsior.
-She'll have the coordinates.
-I've already got him, sir.
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
Sulu!
You realize that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations.
I'm sorry, Captain.
Your message is breaking up.
Bless you, Sulu.
Where is the peace conference?
They're going to attempt another assassination.
The conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border.
I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
I'm afraid we're gonna need more than that.
There's a bird-of-prey on the lookout for us, and she can fire while cloaked.
Surely not.
Hold on.
How many of those things are there?
Come on, Lieutenant.
-Just the prototype.
-You hear that?
I'm getting underway now, but we're now in Alpha Quadrant.
The chances of our reaching the conference in time are slim.
When does this conference start?
According to my information, today.
Thank you, Captain Sulu.
Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
Spock?
I prefer it dark.
Dining on ashes?
You were right.
It was arrogant presumption on my part that got us into this situation.
You and the doctor might have been killed.
The night is young.
You said it yourself.
It was logical.
Peace is worth a few personal risks.
You're a great one for logic.
I'm a great one for rushing in where angels fear to tread.
We're both extremists.
Reality is probably somewhere in between.
I couldn't get past the death of my son.
I was prejudiced by her accomplishments as a Vulcan.
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was.
Is it possible that we two, you and I, have grown so old and so inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?
Would that constitute a joke?
Don't crucify yourself.
It wasn't your fault.
I was responsible.
-For no actions but your own.
-That is not what you said at your trial.
That was as captain of the ship.
Human beings...
But, Captain, we both know that I am not human.
Spock, you want to know something?
Everybody's human.
I find that remark insulting.
Come on.
I need you.
Madam Chancellor, members of the Diplomatic Corps, honored guests,
the United Federation of Planets welcomes you to Camp Khitomer.
She's out here somewhere.
But if she is cloaked...
Then all we have is a neutron radiation surge, and by the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes.
209.
206.
203.
-Close enough to beam down?
-Not yet, Captain.
In two minutes. 158.
-Go to impulse power for Khitomer orbit.
-Aye, sir.
Let us redefine progress to mean that just because we can do a thing, it does not necessarily follow that we must do that thing.
-Uhura?
-Nothing, Captain.
If she's here, she's rigged for silent running.
Coming up on transporter range in 57 seconds.
Transporter Room, stand by to beam down.
...53 48 seconds.
...44...
I can see you, Kirk.
Chang.
Can you see me?
Now, be honest, Captain.
Warrior to warrior, you do prefer it this way, don't you?
As it was meant to be.
No peace in our time.
"Once more unto the breach, dear friends."
-This is fun.
-Reverse engines.
All astern.
One and a half impulse power.
Back off!
Back off!
What's she doing?
What's she waiting for?
Probably attempting to ascertain why we are reversing, wondering whether we detect her.
Incoming!
-In range?
-Not yet, sir.
Come on.
Come on.
-She'll fly apart.
-Fly her apart, then!
Many speculated about my father's motives.
There were those who said he was an idealist.
Others said he had no choice.
If Praxis had not exploded, then quite possibly his idealism would not have found expression.
We are a proud race, and we are here because we intend to go on being proud.
-Go to auxiliary power!
-Auxiliary circuits destroyed, Captain.
"Tickle us, do we not laugh?
Prick us, do we not bleed?
"Wrong us,
"shall we not revenge?"
Gas.
Gas, Captain.
Under impulse power, she expends fuel like any other vessel.
We call it plasma, but whatever the Klingon designation, it is merely ionized gas.
Well, what about all of that equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
-Well, the thing's gotta have a tailpipe.
-Doctor, would you care to assist me
-in performing surgery on a torpedo?
-Fascinating.
Hard to starboard!
The proposed agenda is as follows.
The total evacuation of Kronos has been calculated within the 50-Earth-year time span.
Phase one, preparation for evacuation.
Come on, reach up!
Captain!
She's packing quite a wallop!
Shields weakening!
Shields up.
All right.
Now we've given them something else to shoot at.
Aye, sir.
The game's afoot, huh?
-Excelsior's been hit.
-"Our revels now are ended," Kirk.
"Cry 'Havoc!
' and let slip the dogs of war."
Bones, where's my torpedo?
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed.
Emergency power!
Gravity control down!
Shields collapsing!
The key, please, Doctor.
Time is short.
The hull has been compromised.
-I wonder how bad?
-Connect echobars.
...to discuss the report on phase two.
-Alter circuit "A."
-Sensor.
I propose that we commence with the minutes of the preparation.
"I am constant as the northern star."
I'd give real money if he'd shut up.
-Plate, please.
-Plate.
...and assimilation will consume...
We've got a heartbeat.
The Klingon empire, the ecological...
-Key, please.
-Key.
Where's that damn torpedo?
She's ready, Jim.
Lock and load.
Fire.
To be, or not to be.
Target that explosion and fire.
Fire.
As I imagine this work will occupy us throughout most of the week, it would be my hope that the delegation could return to their capitals to implement the provisions of phase one, no later than the first of next month.
Scotty.
As you know, time is of the essence.
-Out of the way!
-Out of the way!
Mr. President!
Mr. President!
Mr. President!
Mr. President!
Kirk, Enterprise.
Protect the Chancellor!
-Arrest those men!
-Arrest yourself.
We've got a full confession.
Cartwright, just a minute.
What's happened?
What's the meaning of all of this?
It's about the future, Madam Chancellor.
Some people think the future means the end of history.
Well, we haven't run out of history quite yet.
Your father called the future the undiscovered country.
People can be very frightened of change.
You've restored my father's faith.
And you've restored my son's.
Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
And the good news is, they're not going to prosecute.
They might as well have prosecuted me.
I felt like Lieutenant Valeris.
Well, they don't arrest people for having feelings.
And it's a good thing, too.
If they did, we'd all have to turn ourselves in.
Captain Kirk.
Captain Sulu.
As much to the crew of the Enterprise, I owe you my thanks.
Nice to see you in action one more time, Captain Kirk.
Take care.
By God, that's a big ship.
-Not so big as her captain, I think.
-So, this is goodbye.
I think it's about time we got underway ourselves.
Captain, I have orders from Starfleet Command.
We're to put back to spacedock immediately to be decommissioned.
If I were human,
I believe my response would be,
"Go to hell."
If I were human.
Course heading, Captain?
Second star to the right, and straight on till morning.
Captain's Log, Stardate 9529.1.
This is the final cruise of the Starship Enterprise under my command.
This ship and her history will shortly become the care of another crew.
To them and their posterity will we commit our future.
They will continue the voyages we have begun, and journey to all the undiscovered countries, boldly going where no man...
Where no one
Stardate 9521.6.
Captain's log U.S.S. Excelsior.
Hikaru Sulu commanding.
After three years I've concluded my first assignment as master of this vessel cataloguing gaseous planetary anomalies in Beta Quadrant.
We're heading home under full impulse power.
I'm pleased to report that ship and crew have functioned well.
According to this, we've completed our survey of the entire sector.
I have an energy wave at 240 degrees mark six port.
Visual!
My...
God!
Shields.
Shields!
She's not answering her helm.
Starboard thrusters.
Turn her into the wave.
Go to impulse power.
- Damage report.
- Checking all systems.
- That was no meteor shower.
- Negative, sir.
The sub-space shock-wave originated at bearing 323.75.
Location...
It's Praxis, sir.
It's a Klingon moon.
Praxis is their key energy production facility.
Send to Klingon High Command. "This is Excelsior, a Federation Starship."
"We have monitored a large explosion in your sector."
- "Do you require assistance?"
- Aye, sir.
Mr Vultane, any more data?
I've confirmed Praxis' location, but...
What is?
- I cannot confirm Praxis' existence.
- On screen.
- Magnify.
- Computer enhancement.
- Praxis?
- What's left of it, sir.
Captain, I'm getting a message from Praxis.
Let's have it.
This is Brigadier Kerla, speaking for the High Command.
There has been an incident on Praxis.
However, everything is under control.
We have no need for assistance.
Obey treaty stipulations and remain outside the Neutral Zone.
This transmission ends now.
- An incident?
- Do we report this, sir?
Are you kidding?
Starfleet Headquartes
What are we doing here?
That suits me.
I just bought a boat.
I'm supposed to be chairing a seminar at the Academy.
- Isn't this just for top brass?
- Where is Sulu?
Captain Sulu?
On assignment.
Where's Spock?
This briefing is classified.
Ladies and gentlemen, the C-in-C.
As you were.
I'll break this information down succinctly.
The Klingon empire has 50 years of life left.
For full details, I'm turning this briefing over to Federation Special Envoy.
Good morning.
Two months ago a Federation Starship monitored an explosion on Praxis.
We believe it was caused by over-mining and insufficient safety precautions.
The moon's decimation means deadly pollution of their ozone.
They will have depleted their oxygen supply in 50 Earth years.
Due to their enormous military budget the Klingon economy doesn't have the resources to combat this catastrophe.
Last month, at the behest of the Vulcan Ambassador, -
- I opened a dialogue with Gorkon, Chancellor of the Klingon High Council.
He proposes to commence negotiations at once.
Negotiations for what?
The dismantling of our space stations and bases along the Neutral Zone, an end to 70 years of hostility, which the Klingons can no longer afford.
Bill, are we talking about mothballing the Starfleet?
Our exploration and scientific programs would be unaffected, but...
I must protest!
To offer Klingons safe haven within Federation space is suicide.
Klingons would become the alien trash of the galaxy.
If we dismantle the fleet, we'd be defenceless before an aggressive species on our territory.
The opportunity here is to bring them to their knees.
Then we'll be in a better position to dictate terms.
- Sir...
- Captain Kirk?
The Klingons have never been trustworthy.
I agree with Admiral Cartwright.
This is a terrifying idea.
It is imperative that we act now to support the Gorkon initiative, lest more conservative elements persuade his empire that it's better to attempt a military solution and die fighting.
You, Captain Kirk, are to be our first olive branch.
We are to rendezvous with the vessel which is bringing Gorkon to Earth and to escort him safely through Federation space.
Me?
There are Klingons who feel the same about the peace treaty as yourself, but they'll think twice about attacking the Enterprise under your command.
I have personally vouched for you in this matter.
You have personally vouched...?
You will extend Chancellor Gorkon full diplomatic courtesy, Captain.
- A full Ambassador is better equipped...
- If there's no further business I wish you and your crew Godspeed.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
I remind you this meeting is classified.
I don't know whether to congratulate you or not, Jim.
I wouldn't.
We volunteered?
There's an old Vulcan proverb.
"Only Nixon could go to China."
How could you vouch for me?
- That's arrogant presumption.
- My father requested that I open...
I know your father is the Vulcan Ambassador, but you know how I feel.
- They're animals.
- Jim...
- There is an historic opportunity here.
- Don't believe them!
Don't trust them.
- They're dying.
- Let them die.
Has it occurred to you that this crew is due to stand down in three months?
We've done our bit for king and country.
You should have trusted me.
Control, this is S-D 103, approach to Space dock.
Over.
You are clear to deliver Captain Kirk and party to N.C.C. 1701 Alpha.
- Captain on the bridge!
- As you were.
Lieutenant?
Val'eris, sir.
We were told you needed a helmsman, so I volunteered.
It is agreeable to see you again.
She was the first Vulcan to graduate at the top of her class at the Academy.
- You must be very proud.
- I don't believe so, sir.
She's a Vulcan, alright.
Let's get this over with.
Departure stations.
- Scotty?
Did you find the engine room?
- Right where I left it.
Stand by.
Uhura, get me the dock master.
Control tower reading, sir.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
This is Control.
Permission to depart granted. 30 seconds for port gates.
- Clear all moorings.
- Awaiting port gates from this mark.
- All lines clear.
- Aft thrusters.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
1 quarter impulse power.
Captain, regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock.
Jim...
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
Aye, sir.
Captain's log.
Stardate 9522.6.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I can never forgive them for the death of my boy.
To escort the Chancellor of the Klingon High Council to a peace summit is problematic, at best.
Spock says this could be an historic occasion.
I'd like to believe him.
But how on Earth can history get past people like me?
- Sorry.
- You could have knocked.
We are almost at the rendezvous, sir.
I thought that you would like to know.
Permission to speak freely, sir.
It is an honour to serve with you.
You piloted well out of space dock, Lieutenant.
I've always wanted to try that.
You've done well, Val'eris.
As your sponsor at the Academy I've followed your career with satisfaction.
And as a Vulcan, you have exceeded my expectations.
I do not understand this representation.
It's a depiction from ancient Earth mythology.
"The expulsion from Paradise."
- Why keep it in your quarters?
- To remind me that all things end.
It is of endings that I wish to speak.
Sir, I address you as a kindred intellect.
Do you not recognise that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
History is replete with turning points.
You must have faith.
- Faith?
- The universe will unfold as it should.
- Is that logical?
Surely we must...
- Logic, logic, logic.
Logic is the beginning of wisdom, Val'eris.
Not the end.
This will be my final voyage on board this vessel as a member of her crew.
Nature abhors a vacuum.
I intend you to replace me.
I could only succeed you, sir.
Now hear this.
All offiicers to the bridge.
Klingon battle cruiser off the port bow.
All Officers to the bridge.
Captain on the bridge!
Shall we raise our shields, Captain?
I've never been this close.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
- Uhura, hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Right standard rudder.
Bring us alongside.
Right standard rudder.
Z plus 5 degrees.
Channel is open, Captain.
This is the Starship Enterprise.
Captain James T. Kirk commanding.
This is Kronos One.
I am Chancellor Gorkon.
We've been ordered to escort you to your meeting on Earth.
Thank you.
Would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard the Enterprise as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We would be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 19:30 hours.
I shall look forward to that.
I hope you're happy.
Captain!
There is a supply of Romulan ale aboard.
It might make the evening pass more... smoothly.
Officer thinking, Lieutenant.
Guess who's coming to dinner.
Energize.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- Captain Kirk.
May I present Captain Spock, whom I believe you know.
Captain, face to face at last.
You have my thanks.
Chancellor.
Gentlemen.
This is my daughter, Azetbur...
My military advisor, Brigadier Kerla...
General Chang, my chief of staff.
I have so wanted to meet you, Captain.
- I'm not sure how to take that.
- Sincere admiration, Kirk.
From one warrior to another.
Right...
This way.
You might enjoy a brief tour.
- They all look alike.
- What about that smell?
You know only top of the line models can even talk...
- You men have work?
- Yes, ma'am.
Then snap to it.
I offer a toast.
The undiscovered country.
- The future.
- The undiscovered country.
Hamlet, act 3, scene 1 .
You have not experienced Shake- speare until you've read him in Klingon.
Captain Kirk.
I thought Romulan ale was illegal.
An advantage of being 1,000 light years from Federation headquarters.
To you, Chancellor Gorkon.
One of the architects of our future.
Chancellor!
Perhaps we are looking at something of that future here.
Tell me, Captain Kirk.
Would you be willing to give up Starfleet?
The Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace.
I wouldn't dispute my first officer.
Starfleet has always been...
There's no need to mince words.
In space, all warriors are cold warriors.
General, are you fond of...
Shakespeare?
We believe all planets have a sovereign claim to inalienable human rights.
"Inalien..." If you could only hear yourselves.
"Human rights." Why, the very name is racist.
The Federation is a "homo sapiens only" club.
Present company excepted, of course.
We know where this is leading - the annihilation of our culture.
That's not true.
No!
"To be or not to be"...
That is the question which preoccupies our people.
- We need breathing room.
- Earth.
Hitler, 1938.
I beg your pardon.
Well...
I see we have a long way to go.
We must do this again sometime.
You don't trust me, do you?
I don't blame you.
If there is to be a brave new world, our generation is going to have the hardest time living in it.
- Captain Spock.
- Chancellor.
Madam.
Captain.
Well, most kind.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
Hmm, Captain?
"Have we not heard the chimes at midnight?"
Thank God!
- Did you see the way they ate?
- Terrible table manners.
I doubt our own behaviour will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy.
I'm going to sleep this off.
Is there any other way we can screw up tonight?
I'm going to go find a pot of black coffee.
The Enterprise hosted Chancellor Gorkon to dinner last night.
Our manners weren't exactly Emily Post.
To the galley
- Romulan ale no longer to be served at diplomatic functions.
Captain Kirk, will you please join me on the bridge?
Captain Kirk?
- Captain.
- What is it?
- I find this curious.
- Spock, I'm really tired.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
Where?
It appears to emanate from us.
The Enterprise?
Val'eris, do you know anything about a radiation surge?
Chekov?
Only the size of my head.
I know what you mean.
- What's happened?
- We've fired on the Chancellor's ship.
Torpedo room!
Please confirm, have we fired?
- Uhura, monitor.
- Aye, sir.
- Direct hit.
- Confirmed, sir.
We've lost gravity!
We are betrayed!
This is the bridge.
Do you read me?
- Did we fire those torpedoes?
- Negative.
We're still fully loaded.
Find Chang.
Unable to confirm or deny firing the torpedoes.
- Hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Kronos One, this is Enterprise.
Do you read?
It's very hard to make out.
There's been weapons firing and a lot of shouting.
- She's still listing.
- She's spinning out of control.
Restoring auxiliary gravity...
Have you not a shred of decency in you, Kirk?
We come in peace, and you blatantly defy that peace.
For that, I shall blow you out of the stars.
- We haven't fired.
- Captain...
According to our data banks, we have.
Twice...
Captain, they're coming about.
- They're preparing to fire.
- Shields up, Captain?
- Captain, our shields.
- Shields up, Captain?
Signal our surrender.
We surrender!
- This is Enterprise.
We surrender.
- If they fire, with our shields down...
- ...we will not be able to respond.
- Repeat, Enterprise surrenders.
- Are we firing torpedoes?
- I wish I knew.
There is look like
- I'm going aboard.
Spock, take the con.
- I involved you, I will go.
No, I'll go.
We'll not be the instigators of war on the eve of universal peace.
I'm going too, they may need a doctor.
Uhura, tell them we're coming, and tell them we're unarmed.
- Have you lost your mind?
!
- I don't understand what's happened.
We're here to help.
Follow me.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- My God!
What has happened here?
- You dare to feign ignorance?
- What happened?
With a direct torpedo hit, you crippled our gravitational field and two of your Starfleet crew beamed aboard wearing magnetic boots.
- Aren't you carrying a surgeon?
- We were until this disgrace.
Then for god's sake, let me help.
I've got a pulse - we can move him.
I need light.
Put him on the table.
Hold him!
Hold him while I stabilize him.
I said hold him!
Sweet Jesus.
- Can you...?
- I don't even know his anatomy.
- His wounds are not closing.
- He's killing him!
He's gone into some kind of damned arrest.
Come on, dammit!
Come on!
He's not responding.
Don't let it end this way, Captain.
Under article 184 of your Interstellar Law I'm placing you under arrest.
You're charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
He tried to save him.
They've been arrested.
Mr Spock, we've got to do something.
I assume command of this ship as of 02:30 hours.
Commander Uhura, notify Starfleet headquarters and request instructions.
We cannot allow them to be taken to Kronos as prisoners.
Opening fire will not retrieve them, and we must avoid an armed conflict.
We will be able to follow the Captain's movements.
- How did you achieve this?
- Time is precious.
We must piece together what happened here tonight.
According to our data bank, this ship fired those torpedoes.
- No way!
- I sympathize, but we need evidence.
Please accompany me.
And if we cannot piece together what happened?
What then, sir?
In that case, Mr Chekov, it resides in the purview of the diplomats.
The Chancellor of the High Council is dead!
The result of an unprovoked attack while he travelled to see you under a flag of truce on a mission of peace!
Captain Kirk was legally arrested for the crime.
He and Dr. McCoy boarded Kronos One of their own free will.
- None of these facts are in dispute.
- I have ordered an investigation.
- In the meantime...
- In the meantime we expect the Federation to abide by the articles of Interstellar Law.
Kirk and Dr. McCoy will stand trial for the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon.
Out of the question.
Ambassador Sarek, can we get them extradited?
I share a measure of personal responsibility in this matter, but I am obliged to confirm my esteemed colleagues legal interpretation.
What is the position of the Romulan government?
I must concur with my colleagues.
You can't believe that Kirk assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council.
Mr President.
I don't know what to believe.
I'm waiting for your answer, sir.
This President is not above the law.
Mr President, Starfleet command is here from San Francisco.
Bill, Admiral Cartwright, please sit down.
Mr President, we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
I'm constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
Sir, would you please take a look at this.
We prepared Operation Retrieve based on the danger of terrorism between the Klingon empire and the Federation.
We can go in, rescue the hostages and get out in 24 hours with acceptable losses.
- We have the technology...
- Yes, yes.
But suppose you precipitate a full-scale war?
Then, quite frankly, we can clean their chronometers.
Mr President, they are vulnerable.
There will never be a better time.
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be.
I'll bear that in mind.
Thank you, gentlemen, that's all for now.
Mr President.
Sir...
Those men have literally saved this planet.
And now they're going to save it again.
By standing trial.
Report back on the double.
Do you read?
- We're to report back at once.
- We can't abandon Kirk and McCoy.
Of course not.
400 years ago, on Earth, workers who felt their livelyhood threatened flung their wooden shoes called "sabots" into the machines to stop them.
Hence the word "sabotage".
We experience technical malfunction.
All back-up systems inoperative.
Excellent.
I mean... too bad.
Mr President, I have been named chancellorin my father's place.
Madam Chancellor, you have my condolences on your loss.
I assure you that this shameful deed will not...
Let us come to the point.
You want this conference to go forward.
I will attend in one week, on one condition.
We will not extradite the prisoners, and you will not attempt to rescue them.
We would consider any such attempt an act of war.
We hope you'll be our guest here on Earth.
After recent events, you will understand if I prefer a neutral site.
And in the interest of security, let us keep the location secret for now.
As you wish, Madam Chancellor.
Attack them now, while we still can.
Attack or be slaves in their world.
We can take whole by force, what they propose to divide.
War is obsolete, General.
As we are in danger of becoming.
Better to die on our feet than live on our knees.
That wasn't what my father wanted.
Your father was killed for what he wanted.
The peace process will go forward.
Kirk...
Kirk will pay for my father's death.
It is as I said, Mr Spock.
Inventory registers every torpedo.
Yet the data banks insist we fired.
- One computer is lying.
- A computer doesn't lie!
Precisely.
Therefore we must inspect each torpedo visually.
That could take hours!
And if they're all there?
Then someone forged an entry in the data banks.
Gorkon's daughter has been named Chancellor.
It was on the news.
I'll bet that bitch killed her father.
- Her own father?
- It is an old story, sir.
They don't place the same value on life as we do, you know that.
Take my word, she did not shed one bloody tear.
Hardly conclusive, since Klingons have no tear-ducts.
Lieutenant, any response from Starfleet since our dispatch?
Yes, sir.
And?
Commander Uhura is experiencing technical difficulties, sir.
Curious.
Very well.
For 24 hours, we will agree this conversation didn't take place.
- A lie?
- An omission.
In 24 hours we won't have a clue where Captain Kirk is.
- I know precisely where he will be.
- You do?
Where?
Kirk, Kirk, Kirk, Kirk...
It's a damn show trial.
The Enterprise fired on Kronos One without provocation.
The Chancellor and his advisors having been lulled into a false sense of security by an invitation to a dinner aboard Captain Kirk's vessel at precisely 19:30 hours that same evening.
Call your first witness.
After the first shot we lost our gravitational field.
I was weightless and couldn't function.
Then two Starfleet crewmen came towards me.
Or perhaps they merely wore Starfleet uniforms.
That remark is speculative.
I move that it be stricken.
We're interested in facts, not theories.
If the gravitational unit was not functioning, how could they walk?
They appeared to be wearing magnetic boots.
- Gravity boots...?
- Dr. McCoy.
Would you be so good as to tell me what is your current medical status?
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
You have a singular wit, Doctor.
For 27 years I've been surgeon aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.
In three months I stand down.
You know...
I believe that you consumed rather a generous amount of Romulan ale in the officers mess on the night in question.
- Objection.
- Sustained.
We all did.
All of us.
That doesn't mean...
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
Barely.
Now be careful, Doctor.
Have you ever in your past saved patients as barely alive as he?
I didn't have the medical knowledge I needed for Klingon anatomy.
- I see.
- You where there.
You say you are due for retirement.
May I ask, do your hands shake?
- Objection!
- I was nervous.
No.
You were incompetent.
You were incompetent!
Whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink.
- The court will have to determine.
- My God, man.
I tried to save him!
I tried to save him.
I was desperate to save him.
He was the last best hope in the Universe for peace.
The witness is excused.
There we have it, citizens.
We have established the particulars of the crime.
And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair.
James Tiberius Kirk.
What would your favourite author say, Captain?
"Let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings."
Tell us your sad story, Kirk.
Tell us that you planned to take revenge for the death of your son.
- That's not true.
- Objection!
Captain Kirk has not been identified as the assassin.
Sustained.
I offer into the record this excerpt from the Captain's personal log.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I've never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Again!
Again!
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I've never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Are those your words?
Those words were spoken by me.
Objection!
My client's political views are not on trial.
On the contrary.
Captain Kirk's views are at the very heart of the matter.
His record shows him to be an insubordinate, unprincipled opportunist with a history of violating the chain of command whenever it suited him.
Continue.
The record shows that Captain Kirk once held the rank of Admiral and he was broken for taking matters into his own hands.
Do you deny being demoted for these charges.
Answer me now!
- I cannot deny it.
- You were demoted?
- For insubordination?
- On occasion, I have disobeyed orders.
Were you obeying or disobeying orders when you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?
I didn't know about it until we boarded the ship.
You still deny the Enterprise fired on Kronos One?
Well
And you still deny your men beamed aboard and shot the Chancellor?
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I didn't witness.
Are you aware that as the captain of a ship, you are responsible for the actions of your men?
I am.
If it's proved that members of your crew carried out the assassination...
- They're setting us up.
Your Honours!
- Do not answer.
Captain Kirk, you will answer the question.
As Captain I'm responsible for the crew under my command.
Your Honours, the state rests.
Send to Commander Enterprise.
"We stand ready to assist you.
Captain Sulu, U.S.S. Excelsior."
It is the determination of this court that the prisoners are guilty as charged.
I wish to note for the record that all the evidence is circumstantial.
I beg the court to consider this when pronouncing its sentence.
So noted.
Captain James T. Kirk, Dr. Leonard McCoy.
In the interest of fostering amity for the forthcoming peace talks, the sentence of death is commuted.
It is the judgement of this court that, without possibility of reprieve or parole you be taken from this place to the dilithium mines
- on the penal asteroid of Rura Penthe.
There to spend the rest of your natural lives.
Rura Penthe!
Known throughout the galaxy as the alien's graveyard.
Better to kill them now and get it over with.
Lieutenant.
The torpedo hit once again, please.
Hold.
It is Enterprise.
We fired.
That is not possible!
All weapons visually accounted for, sir.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains must be the truth.
What does that mean?
That if we cannot have fired those torpedoes, someone else did.
They didn't fire on themselves and there are no other ships present.
- There was a neutron surge.
- Not from us.
A neutron surge that big could only be produced by another ship.
- Kronos One?
- Too far away.
Very near us.
Possibly beneath us.
If there were a ship beneath us, the Klingons would have seen it.
Would they?
- A Bird of Prey?
- A Bird of Prey.
- Cloaked?
- They can't fired when they're cloaked.
All things being equal, I would agree.
However, things are not equal.
This one can.
- We must inform Starfleet Command.
- Of what?
A new weapon that's invisible?
They'll call us raving lunatics.
They'll say we'll say anything to exonerate the Captain.
And they would be correct.
We have no evidence.
Only a theory which happens to fit the facts.
Assuming you're right.
Why would they fire on their own President?
Indeed.
This ship will be searched from bow to stern.
I do not understand.
If there was a ship underneath us surely the assassins beamed aboard from that vessel, not Enterprise.
You're forgetting something, Mr Chekov.
According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
If we did, the killers are here.
If we did not, whoever altered the data banks is here.
In either case, what we are looking for is here.
- What are we looking for, sir?
- Lieutenant.
Two pairs of gravity boots.
This is the gulag Rura Penthe.
There is no stockades, no guard tower, no electronic frontier.
Only a magnetic shield prevents beaming.
Punishment means exile from prison to the surface.
On the surface, nothing can survive.
Work well, and you will be treated well.
Work badly, and you will die.
Oh, my God!
The universal translator has been confiscated.
I'm sorry...?
He's definitely on about something, Jim.
If this is your spot, we'll move on.
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
- He's got it.
- And your coat.
I'm afraid not.
It wouldn't fit.
- Thanks.
- This will help keep you warm.
- I'm Martia.
You're Kirk and McCoy.
- How did you know that?
We don't get many presidential assassins.
- We didn't kill Gorkon.
- Of course not.
- But there's a reward for your death.
- That figures.
We've been set up.
Somebody up there wants you out of the way.
- Any progress?
- None.
A crew of 300 are looking everywhere, but the killers may still be among them.
Surely they have disposed of these boots by now.
Would it not have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
Logic must give way to physics.
Gravity wasn't restored when they escaped.
Without the boots, they would have floated off the transporter pads.
Why not simply vaporize them?
Like this?
As you know, no one can fire an unauthorized phaser aboard a starship.
Suppose, when they returned, they threw the boots into the refuse.
I'm having the refuse searched.
If I'm correct, those boots will cling to the killer's necks like Tiberian bats.
They couldn't escape without them nor throw them out the window.
Those boots are here.
Somewhere.
- Did someone fire off a phaser?
- It's alright.
It's nothing.
Mr Spock, Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
- Who fired the...
- Ah, Mr Scott.
I hear you have difficulty with the warp drive.
How long do you need for repair?
There's nothing wrong with the bloody thing.
If we return to space dock, the killers can dispose of their footwear and we will never see the Captain or Dr. McCoy alive again.
- It could take weeks.
- Thank you.
Val'eris, inform Starfleet our warp drive is inoperative.
- A lie?
- An error.
We have lost all contact with the Captain and Dr. McCoy.
Yes, at the moment they're surrounded by a magnetic shield.
But if I know the Captain, he is deep into planning his escape.
You've got him where you want him, Jim!
- Are you alright?
- I think so.
- They'll respect you now.
- I was lucky that thing had knees.
That was not his knee.
Not everybody keep their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Anything you want to tell me?
See what you can do for him.
Let him know we're not holding a grudge.
Suppose he's holding a grudge?
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
- Do you want to get out of here?
- There's got to be a way.
Three months before retirement.
What a way to finish.
- We're not finished.
- Speak for yourself.
One day, one night...
Kobayashi Maru!
Bones!
Are you afraid of the future?
I believe that was the general idea that I was trying to convey.
- I don't mean this future.
- What is this - multiple choice?
Some people are afraid...
of what might happen.
- I was terrified.
- What terrified you, specifically?
No more neutral zone.
I was used to hating Klingons.
It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his words.
- Spock was right.
- We all felt exactly the same.
No.
Somebody felt a lot worse.
I'm beginning to understand why.
If you've got any bright ideas, now is the time.
Time is the problem.
You and I are nothing.
You heard the judge - the peace conference is on again.
Whoever killed Gorkon is bound to attempt another assassination.
Unless we can get out of here.
It's me
- Martia.
Listen.
No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
- Except us.
- It is possible.
I know how to get outside the shield.
- How do we fit in?
- Getting outside the shield is easy.
After that, you have to get us off the surface before we freeze.
Can you?
- It's possible.
- I can't make it alone.
You're the likeliest candidate to come here for months.
Candidate for what?
Go to lift 7 in the morning for mining duty.
I'll see you there.
Don't disappoint me.
- What is it with you, anyway?
- Still think we're finished?
More than ever.
Sorry to wake you, sir.
Starfleet requests any data we have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
What?
They're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to space dock, sir.
Signal Starfleet that we have no idea location Enterprise.
- Sir?
- You have hearing problems?
No, sir.
Klingon blood.
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
This is the first evidence which corroborates our theory.
Now we go to Starfleet?
We expand our search to include uniforms.
All uniforms?
Clear, sir.
Make a hole.
Coming through.
Coming through.
Sir!
Sir!
- I think we've been had.
- No, you weren't, Doctor.
Get off at the first level.
Follow the gang into the mine.
They don't take girls.
- You are crewman Dax?
- Yes.
What is the problem?
Perhaps you know Russian epic of Cinderella?
If shoe fits - wear it.
Mr Chekov...
Watch me.
What kind of creature is this?
Last night you two were...
Don't remenber me.
Get in.
Come on.
We don't have a lot of time.
Hurry!
Up there.
Come on - climb!
Here, you'll need these.
Quickly!
Stay close.
- There they are.
- They emerge from the beaming shield.
Mr Scott, start your engines.
Mr Chekov, set course for Rura Penthe.
Mr Spock, Rura Penthe is deep inside the Klingon frontier.
- If we're discovered...
- Correct.
We need a feat of linguistic legerdemain and intrepidity before the Captain and Dr. McCoy freeze to death.
- Leave me, I'm finished.
- No!
Bones, I'm wearing a viridium patch on my back.
Spock slapped it there before we went on Gorkon's ship.
That cunning little Vulcan.
Come on!
We're in the clear.
Now that we're outside the shield, they can locate us two sectors away.
If they're even looking for us.
This is listening post Morska.
What ship is that, over?
We must respond.
A universal translator would be recognised.
We am thy freighter...
Ursva.
Six weeks out of Kronos.
"What is your destination, over? "
We is condemning food things and supplies.
Don't catch any bugs.
Would you mind explaining that little trick you do?
- I'm a Chameloid.
- I've heard about you.
Shape-shifters.
I thought you were mythical.
Give a girl a chance, Captain.
It takes a lot of effort.
I don't doubt it.
Stop me if I'm wrong, but do we have any way of knowing whether this is the real you?
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.
We're outside the shield.
Now it's your turn, Captain.
If you say so.
Are you crazy?
!
She didn't need our help.
Where did you get these convenient clothes?
Don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue.
It's to let them know where we are.
Ask her what she's getting in return.
A full pardon... which doesn't cover this.
An accident wasn't good enough.
Come on, Spock.
Good enough for one.
Two would have looked suspicious.
Killed while attempting escape.
That's convincing for both.
Surprise!
- Your friends are late.
- They'll be along.
- I can't believe I kissed you.
- Must have been your lifelong ambition.
Isn't it time you became something else?
I like it here.
Well, well, well...
What took you so long?
Kill him, he's the one.
Not me, you idiot - him!
- No witnesses.
- Killed while trying to escape.
- Damned clever, if you ask me.
- It's a classic.
- That's what he wanted.
- Who?
Who wanted us killed?
Since you're all going to die anyway, why not tell you?
His name is...
Damn it!
What the hell!
Son of a...!
Couldn't you have waited two seconds?
He was about to explain the whole thing.
- You want to go back?
- Absolutely not!
This is the bridge.
We're still in Klingon space.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
They were beamed aboard a Federation Starship.
I could trace...
Escaped.
Kirk cannot know the location of the peace conference.
Are you sure?
Will you take that chance?
Helmsman, make course to intercept Enterprise.
The Klingons have a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked.
- She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
- So that's it.
We believe that Gorkon's murderers are aboard this ship.
- Has the peace conference begun?
- Who knows?
The location is secret.
- There's always something.
- Captain!
Mr Spock!
I found the uniforms with the Klingon blood on them.
But the uniforms belong to these two men.
Burke and Samno.
Not anymore.
Phaser on "stun" at close range.
First rule of assassination - kill the assassins.
- Now we're back to square one.
- Can I talk to you?
- Why weren't they vaporized?
- It would set off the alarm.
It's possible.
Now hear this.
Now hear this.
Court reporter to sick bay.
Code blue - urgent.
Statements to be taken at once from Yeomen Burke and Samno.
Repeat, court reporter to sick bay.
Code blue - urgent.
Statements to be taken.
Repeat, statements to be taken from Yeomen Burke and Samno.
You have to shoot.
If you are logical, you have to shoot.
- I do not want to.
- What you want is irrelevant.
What you've chosen is at hand.
I'd just as soon you didn't.
The operation is over.
I did not fire.
You cannot prove anything.
Yes, I can.
At my trial my personal log was used against me.
How long did you wait outside my quarters before I noticed you?
You knew?
I tried to tell you, but you would not listen.
Neither of us was hearing very well that night.
There were things I tried to tell you, about having faith.
You have betrayed the Federation.
All of you.
- And what have you've been doing?
- Saving Starfleet.
Klingons cannot be trusted.
Sir...
You said so yourself.
They killed your son.
Did you not wish Gorkon dead?
"Let them die", you said.
Did I misinterpret you?
And you were right.
They conspired with us to assassinate their own Chancellor.
How trustworthy can they be?
Klingons and Federation members conspiring together.
- Who is "us"?
- All who stands to lose from peace.
Names, Lieutenant.
My comrades will make certain all your transmissions are jammed.
- Names, Lieutenant!
- I do not remember.
A lie?
A choice.
Spock.
Admiral Cartwright.
From Starfleet?
Who else?
General...
Chang.
- Who else?
- Romulan Ambassador and others.
Where is the peace conference?
Where is the peace conference?
She does not know.
Then we're dead.
I have been dead before.
Contact Excelsior.
- She'll have the co-ordinates.
- I've already got it, sir.
- Standing by, Captain Kirk.
- Sulu.
You realize that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations.
I'm sorry, Captain.
Yourmessage is breaking up.
Bless you, Sulu.
Where is the peace conference?
They'll attempt another assassination.
It's at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border.
I'm sending the co-ordinates on a coded frequency.
We'll need more than that.
There's a Bird of Prey on the look-out for us that can fire when cloaked.
Surely not.
How many of those things are there?
Come on, Lieutenant.
- Just the prototype.
- Do you hear that?
I'm getting under way now.
We're in Alpha Quadrant.
The chances of our reaching the conference in time are slim.
- When does this conference start?
- According to my information - today.
- Thank you, Captain Sulu.
- Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
Spock?
I prefer it dark.
- Dining on ashes?
- You were right.
It was arrogant presumption on my part that got us into this situation.
You and the Doctor might have been killed.
The night is young.
You said it yourself, it was logical.
Peace is worth a few personal risks.
You're a great one for logic.
I'm a great one for rushing in where angels fear to tread.
We're both extremists.
Reality is probably somewhere in between.
I couldn't get past the death of my son.
I was prejudiced by her accomplishments as a Vulcan.
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was.
Is it possible that we two, you and I, have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?
Would that constitute a joke?
- It wasn't your fault.
- I was responsible.
- For no actions but your own.
- That's not what you said at your trial.
That was as captain of the ship.
Human beings...
We both know that I am not human.
Do you want to know something?
Everybody's human.
I find that remark... insulting.
Come, I need you.
Madam Chancellor, members of the diplomatic corps honoured guests.
The United Federation of Planets welcomes you to Camp Khitomer.
She's out here somewhere.
- But if she's cloaked...
- Then all we have is a radiation surge.
By the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes.
2.06... 2.03...
- Close enough to beam down?
- Not yet.
In two minutes. 1 .58.
Go to impulse power for Khitomer.
Let us redefine progress to mean that just because we can do a thing it does not necessarily follow that we must do that thing.
- Uhura?
- Nothing, Captain.
If she's here, she's rigged for silent running.
Coming up on transporter range in 57 seconds.
Transporter room.
Stand by to beam down.
53... 48 seconds.
44...
I can see you, Kirk.
Chang.
Can you see me?
Now be honest, Captain.
Warrior to warrior.
You do prefer it this way, don't you?
As it was meant to be.
No peace in our time.
"Once more unto the breach, dearfriends. "
- This is fun.
- Reverse engines.
All astern.
One and a half impulse power.
Back off!
What's she doing?
What's she waiting for?
Probably attempting to ascertain why we are reversing.
Wondering whether we detect her.
Incoming!
- In range?
- Not yet, sir.
Come on!
- She'll fly apart.
- Fly her apart, then!
Many speculated about my father's motives.
Some said he was an idealist.
Others said he had no choice.
If Praxis had not exploded, his idealism wouldn't have found expression.
We are a proud race.
We are here because we intend to go on being proud.
- Go to auxiliary power!
- Auxiliary circuits destroyed.
"Tickle us, do we not laugh?
Prick us, do we not bleed?"
"Wrong us, shall we not revenge?"
Gas.
Gas, Captain.
Under impulse power she expands fuel, like all vessels.
We call it "plasma", but it is merely ionised gas.
What about our equipment to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
The thing's got to have a tail-pipe.
Doctor, would you assist me in performing surgery on a torpedo?
Fascinating.
Hard to starboard.
The proposed agenda is as follows:
The evacuation of Kronos has been calculated within the 50 Earth year time span.
Phase 1 - preparation for evacuation...
Captain, she's packing quite a wallop.
Shields weakening.
Shields up!
Alright, now we're giving them something else to shoot at.
The game's afoot.
- Excelsior's been hit!
- "Our revels now are ended", Kirk.
"Cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war."
- Bones, where's my torpedo?
- Bet you wished you'd stayed in bed.
Shields collapsing!
The key, please.
Time is short.
- The hull has been compromised.
- I wonder how bad.
Connect echo-bars.
...discuss the report on phase 2.
- Alter circuit A.
- Sensor.
...we commence within minutes of the preparation.
- "I am constant as the Northern star."
- I'd give real money, if he'd shut up.
Plate, please.
...and assimilation will consume...
We've got a heart beat.
...with the Klingon Empire...
Key, please.
- Where's that torpedo?
- She's ready.
Lock and load!
Fire!
"To be... or not" "to be."
Target that explosion and fire.
Fire!
This work will occupy us throughout most of the week.
I hope that the delegation can implement the provisions of Phase 1 by the first of next month.
As you know, time is of the essence.
Out of the way!
Mr President!
Mr President!
Kirk, Enterprise.
Protect the Chancellor!
- Arrest those men!
- Arrest yourself!
We've got a full confession.
- This is not Klingon blood.
- Cartwright.
Just a minute.
It's Colonel West!
What's happened?
What's the mean of all of this?
It's about the future, Madam Chancellor.
Some people think the future means the end of history.
We haven't run out of history quite yet.
Your father called the future "the undiscovered country".
People can be very frightened of change.
You've restored my father's faith.
And you've restored my son's.
Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
And they're not going to prosecute.
They could have prosecuted me.
I felt like Val'eris.
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
And it's a good thing, too.
If they did, we'd all have to turn ourselves in.
- Captain Kirk.
- Captain Sulu.
As much to the crew of the Enterprise, I owe you my thanks.
Nice to see you in action one more time, Captain Kirk.
Take care.
- My God, that's a big ship.
- Not so big as her captain.
So...
This is goodbye?
It's about time we got underway ourselves.
Captain, I have orders from Starfleet Command.
We're to put back to space dock immediately... to be decommissioned.
If I were human, I believe my response would be:
"Go to hell."
If I were human.
Course heading, Captain?
Second star to the right.
And straight on 'til morning.
Captain's log, stardate 9529. 1.
This is the final cruise of the Starship Enterprise under my command.
This ship, and her history will shortly become the care of another crew.
To them and their posterity will we commit our future.
They'll continue the voyages we have begun and journey to all the undiscovered countries boldly going where no man, where no one has gone before.
Stardate 9521.6.
Captain's log U.S.S. Excelsior.
Hikaru Sulu commanding.
After three years I've concluded my first assignment as master of this vessel cataloguing gaseous planetary anomalies in Beta Quadrant.
We're heading home under full impulse power.
I'm pleased to report that ship and crew have functioned well.
According to this, we've completed our survey of the entire sector.
I have an energy wave at 240 degrees mark six port.
Visual!
My...
God!
Shields.
Shields!
She's not answering her helm.
Starboard thrusters.
Turn her into the wave.
Go to impulse power.
- Damage report.
- Checking all systems.
- That was no meteor shower.
- Negative, sir.
The sub-space shock-wave originated at bearing 323.75.
Location...
It's Praxis, sir.
It's a Klingon moon.
Praxis is their key energy production facility.
Send to Klingon High Command. "This is Excelsior, a Federation Starship."
"We have monitored a large explosion in your sector."
- "Do you require assistance?"
- Aye, sir.
- Mr Vultane, any more data?
- I've confirmed Praxis' location, but...
- I cannot confirm Praxis' existence.
- On screen.
- Magnify.
- Computer enhancement.
- Praxis?
- What's left of it, sir.
Captain, I'm getting a message from Praxis.
Let's have it.
This is Brigadier Kerla, speaking for the High Command.
There has been an incident on Praxis.
However, everything is under control.
We have no need for assistance.
Obey treaty stipulations and remain outside the Neutral Zone.
This transmission ends now.
- An incident?
- Do we report this, sir?
Are you kidding?
- What are we doing here?
- Maybe it's a retirement party.
That suits me.
I just bought a boat.
I'm supposed to be chairing a seminar at the Academy.
- Isn't this just for top brass?
- Where is Sulu?
Captain Sulu?
On assignment.
Where's Spock?
This briefing is classified.
Ladies and gentlemen, the C-in-C.
As you were.
I'll break this information down succinctly.
The Klingon empire has 50 years of life left.
For full details, I'm turning this briefing over to Federation Special Envoy.
Good morning.
Two months ago a Federation Starship monitored an explosion on Praxis.
We believe it was caused by over-mining and insufficient safety precautions.
The moon's decimation means deadly pollution of their ozone.
They will have depleted their oxygen supply in 50 Earth years.
Due to their enormous military budget the Klingon economy doesn't have the resources to combat this catastrophe.
Last month, at the behest of the Vulcan Ambassador, -
- I opened a dialogue with Gorkon, Chancellor of the Klingon High Council.
He proposes to commence negotiations at once.
Negotiations for what?
The dismantling of our space stations and bases along the Neutral Zone, an end to 70 years of hostility, which the Klingons can no longer afford.
Bill, are we talking about mothballing the Starfleet?
Our exploration and scientific programs would be unaffected, but...
I must protest!
To offer Klingons safe haven within Federation space is suicide.
Klingons would become the alien trash of the galaxy.
If we dismantle the fleet, we'd be defenceless before an aggressive species on our territory.
The opportunity here is to bring them to their knees.
Then we'll be in a better position to dictate terms.
- Sir...
- Captain Kirk?
The Klingons have never been trustworthy.
I agree with Admiral Cartwright.
This is a terrifying idea.
It is imperative that we act now to support the Gorkon initiative, lest more conservative elements persuade his empire that it's better to attempt a military solution and die fighting.
You, Captain Kirk, are to be our first olive branch.
We are to rendezvous with the vessel which is bringing Gorkon to Earth and to escort him safely through Federation space.
Me?
There are Klingons who feel the same about the peace treaty as yourself, but they'll think twice about attacking the Enterprise under your command.
I have personally vouched for you in this matter.
You have personally vouched?
You will extend Chancellor Gorkon full diplomatic courtesy, Captain.
- A full Ambassador is better equipped...
- If there's no further business I wish you and your crew Godspeed.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
I remind you this meeting is classified.
I don't know whether to congratulate you or not, Jim.
I wouldn't.
We volunteered?
There's an old Vulcan proverb.
"Only Nixon could go to China."
How could you vouch for me?
- That's arrogant presumption.
- My father requested that I open...
I know your father is the Vulcan Ambassador, but you know how I feel.
- They're animals.
- Jim...
- There is an historic opportunity here.
- Don't believe them!
Don't trust them.
- They're dying.
- Let them die.
Has it occurred to you that this crew is due to stand down in three months?
We've done our bit for king and country.
You should have trusted me.
Control, this is S-D 103, approach to Space dock.
Over.
You are clear to deliver Captain Kirk and party to N.C.C. 1701 Alpha.
- Captain on the bridge!
- As you were.
Lieutenant?
Val'eris, sir.
We were told you needed a helmsman, so I volunteered.
It is agreeable to see you again.
She was the first Vulcan to graduate at the top of her class at the Academy.
- You must be very proud.
- I don't believe so, sir.
She's a Vulcan, alright.
Let's get this over with.
Departure stations.
- Scotty?
Did you find the engine room?
- Right where I left it.
Stand by.
Uhura, get me the dock master.
Control tower reading, sir.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
This is Control.
Permission to depart granted. 30 seconds for port gates.
- Clear all moorings.
- Awaiting port gates from this mark.
- All lines clear.
- Aft thrusters.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
1 quarter impulse power.
Captain, regulations specify thrusters only while in space dock.
Jim...
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
Aye, sir.
Captain's log.
Stardate 9522.6.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I can never forgive them for the death of my boy.
To escort the Chancellor of the Klingon High Council to a peace summit is problematic, at best.
Spock says this could be an historic occasion.
I'd like to believe him.
But how on Earth can history get past people like me?
- Sorry.
- You could have knocked.
We are almost at the rendezvous, sir.
I thought that you would like to know.
Permission to speak freely, sir.
It is an honour to serve with you.
You piloted well out of space dock, Lieutenant.
I've always wanted to try that.
You've done well, Val'eris.
As your sponsor at the Academy I've followed your career with satisfaction.
And as a Vulcan, you have exceeded my expectations.
I do not understand this representation.
It's a depiction from ancient Earth mythology.
"The expulsion from Paradise."
- Why keep it in your quarters?
- To remind me that all things end.
It is of endings that I wish to speak.
Sir, I address you as a kindred intellect.
Do you not recognise that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
History is replete with turning points.
You must have faith.
- Faith?
- The universe will unfold as it should.
- Is that logical?
Surely we must...
- Logic, logic, logic.
Logic is the beginning of wisdom, Val'eris.
Not the end.
This will be my final voyage on board this vessel as a member of her crew.
Nature abhors a vacuum.
I intend you to replace me.
I could only succeed you, sir.
Now hear this.
All officers to the bridge.
Klingon battle cruiser off the port bow.
All Officers to the bridge.
Captain on the bridge!
Shall we raise our shields, Captain?
I've never been this close.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
- Uhura, hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Right standard rudder.
Bring us alongside.
Right standard rudder.
Z plus 5 degrees.
Channel is open, Captain.
This is the Starship Enterprise.
Captain James T. Kirk commanding.
This is Kronos One.
I am Chancellor Gorkon.
We've been ordered to escort you to your meeting on Earth.
Thank you.
Would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard the Enterprise as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We would be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 19:30 hours.
I shall look forward to that.
I hope you're happy.
Captain!
There is a supply of Romulan ale aboard.
It might make the evening pass more... smoothly.
Officer thinking, Lieutenant.
Guess who's coming to dinner.
Energize.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- Captain Kirk.
May I present Captain Spock, whom I believe you know.
Captain, face to face at last.
You have my thanks.
Chancellor.
Gentlemen.
This is my daughter, Azetbur...
My military advisor, Brigadier Kerla and this is General Chang, my chief of staff.
I have so wanted to meet you, Captain.
- I'm not sure how to take that.
- Sincere admiration, Kirk.
From one warrior to another.
Right...
This way.
You might enjoy a brief tour.
- They all look alike.
- What about that smell?
You know only top of the line models can even talk...
- You men have work?
- Yes, ma'am.
Then snap to it.
I offer a toast.
The undiscovered country.
- The future.
- The undiscovered country.
Hamlet, act 3, scene 1.
You have not experienced Shake- speare until you've read him in Klingon.
Captain Kirk.
I thought Romulan ale was illegal.
An advantage of being 1,000 light years from Federation headquarters.
To you, Chancellor Gorkon.
One of the architects of our future.
Chancellor!
Perhaps we are looking at something of that future here.
Tell me, Captain Kirk.
Would you be willing to give up Starfleet?
The Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace.
I wouldn't dispute my first officer.
Starfleet has always been...
There's no need to mince words.
In space, all warriors are cold warriors.
General, are you fond of...
Shakespeare?
We believe all planets have a sovereign claim to inalienable human rights.
"Inalien..." If you could only hear yourselves.
"Human rights." Why, the very name is racist.
The Federation is a "homo sapiens only" club.
Present company excepted, of course.
We know where this is leading - the annihilation of our culture.
That's not true.
No!
"To be or not to be"...
That is the question which preoccupies our people.
- We need breathing room.
- Earth.
Hitler, 1938.
I beg your pardon.
Well...
I see we have a long way to go.
We must do this again sometime.
You don't trust me, do you?
I don't blame you.
If there is to be a brave new world, our generation is going to have the hardest time living in it.
- Captain Spock.
- Chancellor.
Madam.
Captain.
Well, most kind.
Parting is such sweet sorrow.
Hmm, Captain?
"Have we not heard the chimes at midnight?"
Thank God!
- Did you see the way they ate?
- Terrible table manners.
I doubt our own behaviour will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy.
I'm going to sleep this off.
Is there any other way we can screw up tonight?
I'm going to go find a pot of black coffee.
The Enterprise hosted Chancellor Gorkon to dinner last night.
Our manners weren't exactly Emily Post.
To the galley
- Romulan ale no longer to be served at diplomatic functions.
Captain Kirk, will you please join me on the bridge?
Captain Kirk?
- Captain.
- What is it?
- I find this curious.
- Spock, I'm really tired.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
- Where?
- It appears to emanate from us.
The Enterprise?
Val'eris, do you know anything about a radiation surge?
Chekov?
Only the size of my head.
I know what you mean.
- What's happened?
- We've fired on the Chancellor's ship.
Torpedo room!
Please confirm, have we fired?
- Uhura, monitor.
- Aye, sir.
- Direct hit.
- Confirmed, sir.
We've lost gravity!
We are betrayed!
This is the bridge.
Do you read me?
- Did we fire those torpedoes?
- Negative.
We're still fully loaded.
Find Chang.
Unable to confirm or deny firing the torpedoes.
- Hailing frequencies.
- Aye, sir.
Kronos One, this is Enterprise.
Do you read?
It's very hard to make out.
There's been weapons firing and a lot of shouting.
- She's still listing.
- She's spinning out of control.
Restoring auxiliary gravity...
Have you not a shred of decency in you, Kirk?
We come in peace, and you blatantly defy that peace.
For that, I shall blow you out of the stars.
- We haven't fired.
- Captain...
According to our data banks, we have.
Twice...
Captain, they're coming about.
- They're preparing to fire.
- Shields up, Captain?
- Captain, our shields.
- Shields up, Captain?
Signal our surrender.
We surrender!
- This is Enterprise.
We surrender.
- If they fire, with our shields down we will not be able to respond.
- Repeat, Enterprise surrenders.
- Are we firing torpedoes?
- I wish I knew.
- I'm going aboard.
Spock, take the con.
- I involved you, I will go.
No, I'll go.
We'll not be the instigators of war on the eve of universal peace.
I'm going too, they may need a doctor.
Uhura, tell them we're coming, and tell them we're unarmed.
- Have you lost your mind?
!
- I don't understand what's happened.
We're here to help.
Follow me.
- Chancellor Gorkon.
- My God!
What has happened here?
- You dare to feign ignorance?
- What happened?
With a direct torpedo hit, you crippled our gravitational field and two of your Starfleet crew beamed aboard wearing magnetic boots.
- Aren't you carrying a surgeon?
- We were until this disgrace.
Then for god's sake, let me help.
I've got a pulse - we can move him.
I need light.
Put him on the table.
Hold him!
Hold him while I stabilize him.
I said hold him!
Sweet Jesus.
- Can you?
- I don't even know his anatomy.
- His wounds are not closing.
- He's killing him!
He's gone into some kind of damned arrest.
Come on, dammit!
Come on!
He's not responding.
Don't let it end this way, Captain.
Under article 184 of your Interstellar Law I'm placing you under arrest.
You're charged with assassinating the Chancellor of the High Council.
He tried to save him.
They've been arrested.
Mr Spock, we've got to do something.
I assume command of this ship as of 02:30 hours.
Commander Uhura, notify Starfleet headquarters and request instructions.
We cannot allow them to be taken to Kronos as prisoners.
Opening fire will not retrieve them, and we must avoid an armed conflict.
We will be able to follow the Captain's movements.
- How did you achieve this?
- Time is precious.
We must piece together what happened here tonight.
According to our data bank, this ship fired those torpedoes.
- No way!
- I sympathize, but we need evidence.
Please accompany me.
And if we cannot piece together what happened?
What then, sir?
In that case, Mr Chekov, it resides in the purview of the diplomats.
The Chancellor of the High Council is dead!
The result of an unprovoked attack while he travelled to see you under a flag of truce on a mission of peace!
Captain Kirk was legally arrested for the crime.
He and Dr. McCoy boarded Kronos One of their own free will.
- None of these facts are in dispute.
- I have ordered an investigation.
- In the meantime...
- In the meantime we expect the Federation to abide by the articles of Interstellar Law.
Kirk and Dr. McCoy will stand trial for the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon.
Out of the question.
Ambassador Sarek, can we get them extradited?
Mr President, I share a measure of personal responsibility in this matter, but I am obliged to confirm my esteemed colleagues legal interpretation.
What is the position of the Romulan government?
I must concur with my colleagues.
You can't believe that Kirk assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council.
Mr President.
I don't know what to believe.
I'm waiting for your answer, sir.
This President is not above the law.
Mr President, Starfleet command is here from San Francisco.
- Mr President.
- Mr President.
Bill, Admiral Cartwright, please sit down.
Mr President, we cannot allow Federation citizens to be abducted.
I'm constrained to observe Interstellar Law.
Sir, would you please take a look at this.
We prepared Operation Retrieve based on the danger of terrorism between the Klingon empire and the Federation.
We can go in, rescue the hostages and get out in 24 hours with acceptable losses.
- We have the technology...
- Yes, yes.
But suppose you precipitate a full-scale war?
Then, quite frankly, we can clean their chronometers.
Mr President, they are vulnerable.
There will never be a better time.
The longer we wait, the less accessible the hostages will be.
I'll bear that in mind.
Thank you, gentlemen, that's all for now.
Mr President.
Sir...
Those men have literally saved this planet.
And now they're going to save it again.
By standing trial.
Report back on the double.
Do you read?
- We're to report back at once.
- We can't abandon Kirk and McCoy.
400 years ago, on Earth, workers who felt their livelyhood threatened flung their wooden shoes called "sabots" into the machines to stop them.
Hence the word "sabotage".
We experience technical malfunction.
All back-up systems inoperative.
Excellent.
I mean... too bad.
Mr President, I have been named chancellor in my father's place.
Madam Chancellor, you have my condolences on your loss.
I assure you that this shameful deed will not...
Let us come to the point.
You want this conference to go forward.
I will attend in one week, on one condition.
We will not extradite the prisoners, and you will not attempt to rescue them.
We would consider any such attempt an act of war.
We hope you'll be our guest here on Earth.
After recent events, you will understand if I prefer a neutral site.
And in the interest of security, let us keep the location secret for now.
As you wish, Madam Chancellor.
Attack them now, while we still can.
Attack or be slaves in their world.
We can take whole by force, what they propose to divide.
War is obsolete, General.
As we are in danger of becoming.
Better to die on our feet than live on our knees.
That wasn't what my father wanted.
Your father was killed for what he wanted.
The peace process will go forward.
Kirk...
Kirk will pay for my father's death.
It is as I said, Mr Spock.
Inventory registers every torpedo.
Yet the data banks insist we fired.
- One computer is lying.
- A computer doesn't lie!
Precisely.
Therefore we must inspect each torpedo visually.
That could take hours!
And if they're all there?
Then someone forged an entry in the data banks.
Gorkon's daughter has been named Chancellor.
It was on the news.
I'll bet that bitch killed her father.
- Her own father?
- It is an old story, sir.
They don't place the same value on life as we do, you know that.
Take my word, she did not shed one bloody tear.
Hardly conclusive, since Klingons have no tear-ducts.
Lieutenant, any response from Starfleet since our dispatch?
Yes, sir.
And?
Commander Uhura is experiencing technical difficulties, sir.
Curious.
Very well.
For 24 hours, we will agree this conversation didn't take place.
- A lie?
- An omission.
In 24 hours we won't have a clue where Captain Kirk is.
- I know precisely where he will be.
- You do?
Where?
Kirk, Kirk, Kirk, Kirk...
It's a damn show trial.
The Enterprise fired on Kronos One without provocation.
The Chancellor and his advisors having been lulled into a false sense of security by an invitation to a dinner aboard Captain Kirk's vessel at precisely 19:30 hours that same evening.
Call your first witness.
After the first shot we lost our gravitational field.
I was weightless and couldn't function.
Then two Starfleet crewmen came towards me.
Or perhaps they merely wore Starfleet uniforms.
That remark is speculative.
I move that it be stricken.
We're interested in facts, not theories.
If the gravitational unit was not functioning, how could they walk?
They appeared to be wearing magnetic boots.
- Gravity boots?
- Dr. McCoy.
Would you be so good as to tell me what is your current medical status?
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
You have a singular wit, Doctor.
For 27 years I've been surgeon aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.
In three months I stand down.
You know...
I believe that you consumed rather a generous amount of Romulan ale in the officers mess on the night in question.
- Objection.
- Sustained.
We all did.
All of us.
That doesn't mean...
Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
Barely.
Now be careful, Doctor.
Have you ever in your past saved patients as barely alive as he?
I didn't have the medical knowledge I needed for Klingon anatomy.
- I see.
- You where there.
You say you are due for retirement.
May I ask, do your hands shake?
- Objection!
- I was nervous.
No.
You were incompetent.
You were incompetent!
Whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink.
- The court will have to determine.
- My God, man.
I tried to save him!
I tried to save him.
I was desperate to save him.
He was the last best hope in the Universe for peace.
The witness is excused.
There we have it, citizens.
We have established the particulars of the crime.
And now we come to the architect of this tragic affair.
James Tiberius Kirk.
What would your favourite author say, Captain?
"Let us sit upon the ground and tell sad stories of the death of kings."
Tell us your sad story, Kirk.
Tell us that you planned to take revenge for the death of your son.
- That's not true.
- Objection!
Captain Kirk has not been identified as the assassin.
I offer into the record this excerpt from the Captain's personal log.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I've never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Again!
Again!
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I've never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Are those your words?
Those words were spoken by me.
Objection!
My client's political views are not on trial.
On the contrary.
Captain Kirk's views are at the very heart of the matter.
His record shows him to be an insubordinate, unprincipled opportunist with a history of violating the chain of command whenever it suited him.
Continue.
The record shows that Captain Kirk once held the rank of Admiral and he was broken for taking matters into his own hands.
Do you deny being demoted for these charges.
Answer me now!
- I cannot deny it.
- You were demoted?
- For insubordination?
- On occasion, I have disobeyed orders.
Were you obeying or disobeying orders when you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?
I didn't know about it until we boarded the ship.
You still deny the Enterprise fired on Kronos One?
And you still deny your men beamed aboard and shot the Chancellor?
I cannot confirm or deny actions which I didn't witness.
Are you aware that as the captain of a ship, you are responsible for the actions of your men?
I am.
If it's proved that members of your crew carried out the assassination...
- They're setting us up.
Your Honours!
- Do not answer.
Captain Kirk, you will answer the question.
As Captain I'm responsible for the crew under my command.
Your Honours, the state rests.
Send to Commander Enterprise.
"We stand ready to assist you.
Captain Sulu, U.S.S. Excelsior."
It is the determination of this court that the prisoners are guilty as charged.
I wish to note for the record that all the evidence is circumstantial.
I beg the court to consider this when pronouncing its sentence.
So noted.
Captain James T. Kirk, Dr. Leonard McCoy.
In the interest of fostering amity for the forthcoming peace talks, the sentence of death is commuted.
It is the judgement of this court that, without possibility of reprieve or parole, you be taken from this place to the dilithium mines on the penal asteroid of Rura Penthe.
There to spend the rest of your natural lives.
Rura Penthe!
Known throughout the galaxy as the alien's graveyard.
Better to kill them now and get it over with.
Lieutenant.
The torpedo hit once again, please.
Hold.
It is Enterprise.
We fired.
That is not possible!
All weapons visually accounted for, sir.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains must be the truth.
What does that mean?
That if we cannot have fired those torpedoes, someone else did.
They didn't fire on themselves and there are no other ships present.
- There was a neutron surge.
- Not from us.
A neutron surge that big could only be produced by another ship.
- Kronos One?
- Too far away.
Very near us.
Possibly beneath us.
If there were a ship beneath us, the Klingons would have seen it.
Would they?
- A Bird of Prey?
- A Bird of Prey.
- Cloaked?
- They can't fired when they're cloaked.
All things being equal, I would agree.
However, things are not equal.
This one can.
- We must inform Starfleet Command.
- Of what?
A new weapon that's invisible?
They'll call us raving lunatics.
They'll say we'll say anything to exonerate the Captain.
And they would be correct.
We have no evidence.
Only a theory which happens to fit the facts.
Assuming you're right.
Why would they fire on their own President?
Indeed.
This ship will be searched from bow to stern.
I do not understand.
If there was a ship underneath us surely the assassins beamed aboard from that vessel, not Enterprise.
You're forgetting something, Mr Chekov.
According to our data banks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
If we did, the killers are here.
If we did not, whoever altered the data banks is here.
In either case, what we are looking for is here.
- What are we looking for, sir?
- Lieutenant.
Two pairs of gravity boots.
This is the gulag Rura Penthe.
There is no stockades, no guard tower, no electronic frontier.
Only a magnetic shield prevents beaming.
Punishment means exile from prison to the surface.
On the surface, nothing can survive.
Work well, and you will be treated well.
Work badly, and you will die.
Oh, my God!
The universal translator has been confiscated.
I'm sorry?
He's definitely on about something, Jim.
If this is your spot, we'll move on.
He wants your obedience to the Brotherhood of Aliens.
- He's got it.
- And your coat.
I'm afraid not.
It wouldn't fit.
- Thanks.
- This will help keep you warm.
- I'm Martia.
You're Kirk and McCoy.
- How did you know that?
We don't get many presidential assassins.
- We didn't kill Gorkon.
- Of course not.
- But there's a reward for your death.
- That figures.
We've been set up.
Somebody up there wants you out of the way.
- Any progress?
- None.
A crew of 300 are looking everywhere, but the killers may still be among them.
Surely they have disposed of these boots by now.
Would it not have been logical to leave them on Gorkon's ship?
Logic must give way to physics.
Gravity wasn't restored when they escaped.
Without the boots, they would have floated off the transporter pads.
Why not simply vaporize them?
Like this?
As you know, no one can fire an unauthorized phaser aboard a starship.
Suppose, when they returned, they threw the boots into the refuse.
I'm having the refuse searched.
If I'm correct, those boots will cling to the killer's necks like Tiberian bats.
They couldn't escape without them nor throw them out the window.
Those boots are here.
Somewhere.
- Did someone fire off a phaser?
- It's alright.
It's nothing.
Mr Spock, Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
- Who fired the...
- Ah, Mr Scott.
I hear you have difficulty with the warp drive.
How long do you need for repair?
There's nothing wrong with the bloody thing.
If we return to space dock, the killers can dispose of their footwear and we will never see the Captain or Dr. McCoy alive again.
- It could take weeks.
- Thank you.
Val'eris, inform Starfleet our warp drive is inoperative.
- A lie?
- An error.
We have lost all contact with the Captain and Dr. McCoy.
Yes, at the moment they're surrounded by a magnetic shield.
But if I know the Captain, he is deep into planning his escape.
You've got him where you want him, Jim!
- Are you alright?
- I think so.
- They'll respect you now.
- I was lucky that thing had knees.
That was not his knee.
Not everybody keep their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Anything you want to tell me?
See what you can do for him.
Let him know we're not holding a grudge.
Suppose he's holding a grudge?
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
- Do you want to get out of here?
- There's got to be a way.
Three months before retirement.
What a way to finish.
- We're not finished.
- Speak for yourself.
One day, one night...
Kobayashi Maru!
Bones!
Are you afraid of the future?
I believe that was the general idea that I was trying to convey.
- I don't mean this future.
- What is this - multiple choice?
Some people are afraid...
of what might happen.
- I was terrified.
- What terrified you, specifically?
No more neutral zone.
I was used to hating Klingons.
It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his words.
- Spock was right.
- We all felt exactly the same.
No.
Somebody felt a lot worse.
I'm beginning to understand why.
If you've got any bright ideas, now is the time.
Time is the problem.
You and I are nothing.
You heard the judge - the peace conference is on again.
Whoever killed Gorkon is bound to attempt another assassination.
Unless we can get out of here.
It's me
- Martia.
Listen.
No one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
- Except us.
- It is possible.
I know how to get outside the shield.
- How do we fit in?
- Getting outside the shield is easy.
After that, you have to get us off the surface before we freeze.
Can you?
- It's possible.
- I can't make it alone.
You're the likeliest candidate to come here for months.
Candidate for what?
Go to lift 7 in the morning for mining duty.
I'll see you there.
Don't disappoint me.
- What is it with you, anyway?
- Still think we're finished?
More than ever.
Sorry to wake you, sir.
Starfleet requests any data we have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
What?
They're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to space dock, sir.
Signal Starfleet that we have no idea location Enterprise.
- Sir?
- You have hearing problems?
No, sir.
Klingon blood.
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
This is the first evidence which corroborates our theory.
Now we go to Starfleet?
We expand our search to include uniforms.
All uniforms?
Clear, sir.
Make a hole.
Coming through.
Coming through.
Sir!
Sir!
- I think we've been had.
- No, you weren't, Doctor.
Get off at the first level.
Follow the gang into the mine.
They don't take girls.
- You are crewman Dax?
- Yes.
What is the problem?
Perhaps you know Russian epic of Cinderella?
If shoe fits - wear it.
Mr Chekov...
Watch me.
What kind of creature is this?
Last night you two were...
Get in.
Come on.
We don't have a lot of time.
Hurry!
Up there.
Come on - climb!
Here, you'll need these.
Quickly!
Stay close.
- There they are.
- They emerge from the beaming shield.
Mr Scott, start your engines.
Mr Chekov, set course for Rura Penthe.
Mr Spock, Rura Penthe is deep inside the Klingon frontier.
- If we're discovered...
- Correct.
We need a feat of linguistic legerdemain and intrepidity before the Captain and Dr. McCoy freeze to death.
- Leave me, I'm finished.
- No!
Bones, I'm wearing a viridium patch on my back.
Spock slapped it there before we went on Gorkon's ship.
That cunning little Vulcan.
Come on!
We're in the clear.
Now that we're outside the shield, they can locate us two sectors away.
If they're even looking for us.
This is listening post Morska.
What ship is that, over?
We must respond.
A universal translator would be recognised.
We am thy freighter...
Ursva.
Six weeks out of Kronos.
"What is your destination, over?"
We is condemning food things and supplies.
Don't catch any bugs.
Would you mind explaining that little trick you do?
- I'm a Chameloid.
- I've heard about you.
Shape-shifters.
I thought you were mythical.
Give a girl a chance, Captain.
It takes a lot of effort.
I don't doubt it.
Stop me if I'm wrong, but do we have any way of knowing whether this is the real you?
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.
We're outside the shield.
Now it's your turn, Captain.
If you say so.
Are you crazy?
!
She didn't need our help.
Where did you get these convenient clothes?
Don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue.
It's to let them know where we are.
Ask her what she's getting in return.
A full pardon... which doesn't cover this.
An accident wasn't good enough.
Come on, Spock.
Good enough for one.
Two would have looked suspicious.
Killed while attempting escape.
That's convincing for both.
Surprise!
- Your friends are late.
- They'll be along.
- I can't believe I kissed you.
- Must have been your lifelong ambition.
Isn't it time you became something else?
I like it here.
Well, well, well...
What took you so long?
Kill him, he's the one.
Not me, you idiot - him!
- No witnesses.
- Killed while trying to escape.
- Damned clever, if you ask me.
- It's a classic.
- That's what he wanted.
- Who?
Who wanted us killed?
Since you're all going to die anyway, why not tell you?
His name is...
Damn it!
What the hell!
Son of a!
Couldn't you have waited two seconds?
He was about to explain the whole thing.
- You want to go back?
- Absolutely not!
This is the bridge.
We're still in Klingon space.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
They were beamed aboard a Federation Starship.
I could trace...
Escaped.
Kirk cannot know the location of the peace conference.
Are you sure?
Will you take that chance?
Helmsman, make course to intercept Enterprise.
The Klingons have a Bird of Prey that can fire while cloaked.
- She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
- So that's it.
We believe that Gorkon's murderers are aboard this ship.
- Has the peace conference begun?
- Who knows?
The location is secret.
- There's always something.
- Captain!
Mr Spock!
I found the uniforms with the Klingon blood on them.
But the uniforms belong to these two men.
Burke and Samno.
Not anymore.
Phaser on "stun" at close range.
First rule of assassination - kill the assassins.
- Now we're back to square one.
- Can I talk to you?
- Why weren't they vaporized?
- It would set off the alarm.
It's possible.
Now hear this.
Now hear this.
Court reporter to sick bay.
Code blue - urgent.
Statements to be taken at once from Yeomen Burke and Samno.
Repeat, court reporter to sick bay.
Code blue - urgent.
Statements to be taken.
Repeat, statements to be taken from Yeomen Burke and Samno.
You have to shoot.
If you are logical, you have to shoot.
- I do not want to.
- What you want is irrelevant.
What you've chosen is at hand.
I'd just as soon you didn't.
The operation is over.
I did not fire.
You cannot prove anything.
Yes, I can.
At my trial my personal log was used against me.
How long did you wait outside my quarters before I noticed you?
You knew?
I tried to tell you, but you would not listen.
Neither of us was hearing very well that night.
There were things I tried to tell you, about having faith.
You have betrayed the Federation.
All of you.
- And what have you've been doing?
- Saving Starfleet.
Klingons cannot be trusted.
Sir...
You said so yourself.
They killed your son.
Did you not wish Gorkon dead?
"Let them die", you said.
Did I misinterpret you?
And you were right.
They conspired with us to assassinate their own Chancellor.
How trustworthy can they be?
Klingons and Federation members conspiring together.
- Who is "us"?
- All who stands to lose from peace.
Names, Lieutenant.
My comrades will make certain all your transmissions are jammed.
- Names, Lieutenant!
- I do not remember.
A lie?
A choice.
Spock.
Admiral Cartwright.
From Starfleet?
Who else?
General...
Chang.
- Who else?
- Romulan Ambassador and others.
Where is the peace conference?
Where is the peace conference?
She does not know.
Then we're dead.
I have been dead before.
Contact Excelsior.
- She'll have the co-ordinates.
- I've already got it, sir.
- Standing by, Captain Kirk.
- Sulu.
You realize that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations.
I'm sorry, Captain.
Your message is breaking up.
Bless you, Sulu.
Where is the peace conference?
They'll attempt another assassination.
It's at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border.
I'm sending the co-ordinates on a coded frequency.
We'll need more than that.
There's a Bird of Prey on the look-out for us that can fire when cloaked.
Surely not.
How many of those things are there?
Come on, Lieutenant.
- Just the prototype.
- Do you hear that?
I'm getting under way now.
We're in Alpha Quadrant.
The chances of our reaching the conference in time are slim.
- When does this conference start?
- According to my information - today.
- Thank you, Captain Sulu.
- Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
Spock?
I prefer it dark.
- Dining on ashes?
- You were right.
It was arrogant presumption on my part that got us into this situation.
You and the Doctor might have been killed.
The night is young.
You said it yourself, it was logical.
Peace is worth a few personal risks.
You're a great one for logic.
I'm a great one for rushing in where angels fear to tread.
We're both extremists.
Reality is probably somewhere in between.
I couldn't get past the death of my son.
I was prejudiced by her accomplishments as a Vulcan.
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was.
Is it possible that we two, you and I, have grown so old and inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?
Would that constitute a joke?
- It wasn't your fault.
- I was responsible.
- For no actions but your own.
- That's not what you said at your trial.
That was as captain of the ship.
Human beings...
We both know that I am not human.
Do you want to know something?
Everybody's human.
I find that remark... insulting.
Come, I need you.
Madam Chancellor, members of the diplomatic corps honoured guests.
The United Federation of Planets welcomes you to Camp Khitomer.
She's out here somewhere.
- But if she's cloaked...
- Then all we have is a radiation surge.
By the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes.
2.06... 2.03...
- Close enough to beam down?
- Not yet.
In two minutes. 1.58.
Go to impulse power for Khitomer.
Let us redefine progress to mean that just because we can do a thing it does not necessarily follow that we must do that thing.
- Uhura?
- Nothing, Captain.
If she's here, she's rigged for silent running.
Coming up on transporter range in 57 seconds.
Transporter room.
Stand by to beam down.
53... 48 seconds.
44...
I can see you, Kirk.
Chang.
Can you see me?
Now be honest, Captain.
Warrior to warrior.
You do prefer it this way, don't you?
As it was meant to be.
No peace in our time.
"Once more unto the breach, dear friends."
- This is fun.
- Reverse engines.
All astern.
One and a half impulse power.
Back off!
What's she doing?
What's she waiting for?
Probably attempting to ascertain why we are reversing.
Wondering whether we detect her.
Incoming!
- In range?
- Not yet, sir.
Come on!
- She'll fly apart.
- Fly her apart, then!
Many speculated about my father's motives.
Some said he was an idealist.
Others said he had no choice.
If Praxis had not exploded, his idealism wouldn't have found expression.
We are a proud race.
We are here because we intend to go on being proud.
- Go to auxiliary power!
- Auxiliary circuits destroyed.
"Tickle us, do we not laugh?
Prick us, do we not bleed?"
"Wrong us, shall we not revenge?"
Gas.
Gas, Captain.
Under impulse power she expands fuel, like all vessels.
We call it "plasma", but it is merely ionised gas.
What about our equipment to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
The thing's got to have a tail-pipe.
Doctor, would you assist me in performing surgery on a torpedo?
Fascinating.
Hard to starboard.
The proposed agenda is as follows:
The evacuation of Kronos has been calculated within the 50 Earth year time span.
Phase 1 - preparation for evacuation...
Captain, she's packing quite a wallop.
Shields weakening.
Shields up!
Alright, now we're giving them something else to shoot at.
The game's afoot.
- Excelsior's been hit!
- "Our revels now are ended", Kirk.
"Cry havoc, and let slip the dogs of war."
- Bones, where's my torpedo?
- Bet you wished you'd stayed in bed.
Shields collapsing!
The key, please.
Time is short.
- The hull has been compromised.
- I wonder how bad.
Connect echo-bars.
...discuss the report on phase 2.
- Alter circuit A.
- Sensor.
...we commence within minutes of the preparation.
- "I am constant as the Northern star."
- I'd give real money, if he'd shut up.
Plate, please.
...and assimilation will consume...
We've got a heart beat.
...with the Klingon Empire...
Key, please.
- Where's that torpedo?
- She's ready.
Lock and load!
Fire!
"To be... or not" "to be."
Target that explosion and fire.
Fire!
This work will occupy us throughout most of the week.
I hope that the delegation can implement the provisions of Phase 1 by the first of next month.
As you know, time is of the essence.
Out of the way!
Mr President!
Mr President!
Kirk, Enterprise.
Protect the Chancellor!
- Arrest those men!
- Arrest yourself!
We've got a full confession.
- This is not Klingon blood.
- Cartwright.
Just a minute.
It's Colonel West!
What's happened?
What's the mean of all of this?
It's about the future, Madam Chancellor.
Some people think the future means the end of history.
We haven't run out of history quite yet.
Your father called the future "the undiscovered country".
People can be very frightened of change.
You've restored my father's faith.
And you've restored my son's.
Once again, we've saved civilization as we know it.
And they're not going to prosecute.
They could have prosecuted me.
I felt like Val'eris.
They don't arrest people for having feelings.
And it's a good thing, too.
If they did, we'd all have to turn ourselves in.
- Captain Kirk.
- Captain Sulu.
As much to the crew of the Enterprise, I owe you my thanks.
Nice to see you in action one more time, Captain Kirk.
Take care.
- My God, that's a big ship.
- Not so big as her captain.
So...
This is goodbye?
It's about time we got underway ourselves.
Captain, I have orders from Starfleet Command.
We're to put back to space dock immediately... to be decommissioned.
If I were human, I believe my response would be:
"Go to hell."
If I were human.
Course heading, Captain?
Second star to the right.
And straight on 'til morning.
Captain's log, stardate 9529. 1.
This is the final cruise of the Starship Enterprise under my command.
This ship, and her history will shortly become the care of another crew.
To them and their posterity will we commit our future.
They'll continue the voyages we have begun and journey to all the undiscovered countries boldly going where no man, where no one has gone before.
Stardate 9521 .6.
Captain's Log, U.S.S. Excelsior.
Hikaru Sulu commanding.
After three years, I've concluded my first assignment as master of this vessel, cataloguing gaseous planetary anomalies in Beta Quadrant.
We're heading home under full impulse power.
I am pleased to report that ship and crew have functioned well.
According to this, we've completed our survey of the entire sector.
I have an energy wave at 240 degrees mark 6 port, sir.
Visual.
My God.
Shields.
Shields!
She's not answering her helm.
Starboard thruster.
Turn her into the wave.
Aye.
Quarter impulse power.
Damage report.
Checking all systems, Captain.
Don't tell me that was any meteor shower.
Negative, sir.
The subspace shockwave originated at bearing 3-2-3 mark 75.
Location... lt's Praxis, sir. lt's a Klingon moon.
Praxis is their key energy production facility.
Send to Klingon High Command.
"This is Excelsior, a Federation starship.
"We have monitored a large explosion in your sector.
"Do you require assistance?"
-Aye, sir.
-Mr Valtane, any more data?
Yes, sir. I've confirmed the location of Praxis, but...
What is it?
I cannot confirm the existence of Praxis.
Onscreen.
Magnify.
Computer enhancement.
-Praxis?
-What's left of it, sir.
Captain, I'm getting a message from Praxis.
Let's have it.
This is Brigadier Kerla speaking for the High Command.
There has been an incident on Praxis.
However, everything is under control.
We have no need for assistance.
Obey treaty stipulations and remain outside the neutral zone.
This transmission ends now.
"An incident"?
-Do we report this, sir?
-Are you kidding?
What are we doing here?
Maybe they're throwing us a retirement party.
-That suits me. I just bought a boat.
-This had better be good.
I'm supposed to be chairing a seminar at the Academy.
Captain, isn't this just for top brass?
If we're all here, where's Sulu?
Captain Sulu.
On assignment.
Where's Spock?
This briefing is classified.
Ladies and gentlemen, the CinC.
As you were.
To break this information down succinctly, the Klingon Empire has roughly 50 years of life left to it.
For full details, I'm turning this briefing over to the Federation's special envoy.
Good morning.
Two months ago, a Federation starship monitored an explosion on the Klingon moon Praxis.
We believe it was caused by over-mining and insufficient safety precautions.
The moon's decimation means the deadly pollution of their ozone.
They will have depleted their supply of oxygen in approximately 50 Earth years.
Due to their enormous military budget, the Klingon economy does not have the resources with which to combat this catastrophe.
Last month, at the behest of the Vulcan ambassador, I opened a dialogue with Gorkon, Chancellor of the Klingon High Council.
He proposes to commence negotiations at once.
Negotiations for what?
The dismantling of our space stations and starbases along the neutral zone, an end to almost 70 years of unremitting hostility, which the Klingons can no longer afford.
Bill, are we talking about mothballing the Starfleet?
Well, I'm sure that our exploration and scientific programmes
-would be unaffected, Captain, but...
-l must protest.
To offer Klingons safe haven within Federation space is suicide.
Klingons would become the alien trash of the galaxy, and if we dismantle the fleet, we'd be defenceless before an aggressive species with a foothold on our territory.
The opportunity here is to bring them to their knees.
Then we'll be in a far better position to dictate terms.
Sir?
Captain Kirk.
The Klingons have never been trustworthy.
I'm forced to agree with Admiral Cartwright.
This is a terrifying idea.
It is imperative that we act now to support the Gorkon initiative lest more conservative elements persuade his empire that it is better to attempt a military solution and die fighting.
You, Captain Kirk, are to be our first olive branch.
We have volunteered to rendezvous with the Klingon vessel which is bringing Chancellor Gorkon to Earth and to escort him safely through Federation space.
Me?
Well, there are Klingons who feel the same way about the peace treaty as yourself and Admiral Cartwright, but they'll think twice about attacking the Enterprise under your command.
I have personally vouched for you in this matter, Captain.
You have personally vouched?
You will extend Chancellor Gorkon full diplomatic courtesy, Captain Kirk.
But a full ambassador would be better equipped... lf there's no further business, I wish you and your crew Godspeed.
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
I remind you, this meeting is classified.
I don't know whether to congratulate you or not, Jim.
I wouldn't.
We volunteered?
There is an old Vulcan proverb, "Only Nixon could go to China."
How could you vouch for me?
That's arrogant presumption.
My father requested that I open negotiations... I know your father's the Vulcan ambassador, for heaven's sake, but you know how I feel about this.
They're animals.
Jim, there is an historic opportunity here.
Don't believe them.
Don't trust them.
-They are dying.
-Let them die.
Has it occurred to you that this crew is due to stand down in three months?
We've done our bit for king and country.
You should have trusted me.
Control, this is SD-103, approach to spacedock.
Over.
SD-1 03, you are clear to deliver Captain Kirk and party to NCC-1 701 Alpha.
Over.
Captain on the Bridge.
-As you were, Lieutenant...
-Valeris, sir.
We were told that you needed a helmsman, so I volunteered.
Lieutenant, it is agreeable to see you again.
Lieutenant was the first Vulcan to be graduated
-at the top of her class at the academy.
-You must be very proud.
I don't believe so, sir.
She's a Vulcan, all right.
Let's get this over with.
Departure stations.
-Scotty.
-Aye, sir?
Did you find the engine room?
Right where l left it, sir.
Standby.
Uhura, get me the dockmaster.
Control tower reading, sir.
Control, this is Enterprise requesting permission to depart.
This is Control, Enterprise.
Permission to depart granted.
Thirty seconds for port gates.
Clear all moorings.
Awaiting port gates from this mark.
All moorings clear.
Aft thrusters.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
One-quarter impulse power.
Captain, may I remind you that regulations specify thrusters only while in spacedock?
Jim?
You heard the order, Lieutenant.
Aye, sir.
Captain's Log, Stardate 9522.6.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I could never forgive them for the death of my boy.
It seems to me our mission to escort the Chancellor of the Klingon High Council to a peace summit is problematic at best.
Spock says this could be an historic occasion, and I'd like to believe him, but how on earth can history get past people like me?
Sorry.
You could have knocked.
We are almost at the rendezvous, sir.
I thought that you would like to know.
Right.
Permission to speak freely, sir.
It is an honour to serve with you.
You piloted well out of spacedock, Lieutenant.
I've always wanted to try that, sir.
You've done well, Valeris.
As your sponsor at the academy, I have followed your career with satisfaction, and as a Vulcan, you've exceeded my expectations.
I do not understand this representation.
It is a depiction from ancient Earth mythology, the expulsion from Paradise.
Why keep it in your quarters?
It is a reminder to me that all things end.
It is of endings that I wish to speak.
Sir, I address you as a kindred intellect.
Do you not recognise that a turning point has been reached in the affairs of the Federation?
History is replete with turning points, Lieutenant.
-You must have faith.
-Faith?
That the universe will unfold as it should.
-But is that logical?
Surely we must...
-Logic, logic and logic.
Logic is the beginning of wisdom, Valeris, not the end.
This will be my final voyage onboard this vessel as a member of her crew.
Nature abhors a vacuum.
I intend you to replace me.
I could only succeed you, sir.
Now hear this.
All officers to the Bridge.
Klingon battle cruiser off the port bow.
All officers to the Bridge.
Captain on the Bridge.
Shall we raise our shields, Captain?
Never been this close.
The Chancellor is undoubtedly awaiting our signal.
-Uhura, hailing frequencies.
-Aye, sir.
Right standard rudder.
Bring us alongside.
Right standard rudder.
Z plus 5 degrees.
Channel is open, Captain.
This is the Starship Enterprise,
Captain James T. Kirk commanding.
This is Kronos One.
I am Chancellor Gorkon.
Chancellor, we've been ordered to escort you through Federation space to your meeting on Earth.
Thank you, Captain.
Would you and your party care to dine this evening aboard the Enterprise with my officers, as guests of the United Federation of Planets?
We would be delighted to accept your gracious invitation.
We'll make arrangements to have you beamed aboard at 1 930 hours.
I shall look forward to that.
-Well, I hope you're happy.
-Captain, there is a supply of Romulan ale aboard.
It might make the evening pass more smoothly.
Officer thinking, Lieutenant.
Guess who's coming to dinner.
Energise.
-Chancellor Gorkon.
-Captain Kirk.
May I present Captain Spock, whom I believe you know.
Captain, face to face at last.
-You have my thanks.
-Chancellor.
Gentlemen, this is my daughter Azetbur,
my military adviser, Brigadier Kerla, and this is General Chang, my chief of staff.
I have so wanted to meet you, Captain.
I'm not sure how to take that.
Sincere admiration, Kirk.
From one warrior to another.
Right.
This way.
I think you might enjoy a brief tour.
-They all look alike.
-What about that smell?
You know only top-of-the-line models can even talk...
You men have work?
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.
Then snap to it.
I offer a toast.
"The undiscover'd country,"
the future.
-"The undiscover'd country." -"The undiscover'd country."
Hamlet, Act lll, Scene 1 .
You've not experienced Shakespeare until you have read him in the original Klingon.
Captain Kirk, I thought Romulan ale was illegal.
One of the advantages of being 1 ,000 light-years from Federation Headquarters.
To you, Chancellor Gorkon, one of the architects of our future.
-Chancellor.
-Chancellor.
Perhaps we are looking at something of that future here.
Tell me, Captain Kirk, would you be willing to give up Starfleet?
I believe the Captain feels that Starfleet's mission has always been one of peace.
Far be it for me to dispute my first officer, but Starfleet has always been at the fore...
Captain, there's no need to mince words.
In space, all warriors are cold warriors.
General, are you fond of
Shakespeare?
We do believe all planets have a sovereign claim to inalienable human rights.
lnalien?
If you could only hear yourselves.
"Human rights."
Why, the very name is racist.
The Federation is no more than a "Homo Sapiens Only" club.
Present company excepted, of course.
In any case, we know where this is leading.
-The annihilation of our culture.
-That's not true.
-No?
-No.
"To be, or not to be."
That is the question which preoccupies our people, Captain Kirk.
-We need breathing room.
-Earth, Hitler, 1 938.
I beg your pardon?
Well... I see we have a long way to go.
We must do this again sometime.
You don't trust me, do you?
I don't blame you.
If there is to be a brave new world, our generation is going to have the hardest time living in it.
Captain Spock.
Chancellor.
-Madam.
-Captain.
Well, most kind.
"Parting is such sweet sorrow," Captain.
Have we not "heard the chimes at midnight"?
Thank God.
Did you see the way they ate?
Terrible table manners.
I doubt that our own behaviour will distinguish us in the annals of diplomacy.
I'm going to sleep this off.
Please let me know if there's some other way we can screw up tonight.
I'm going to go find a pot of black coffee.
The Enterprise hosted Chancellor Gorkon and company to dinner last night.
Our manners weren't exactly Emily Post.
Note to the galley,
Romulan ale no longer to be served at diplomatic functions.
Captain Kirk, will you please join me on the Bridge?
Captain Kirk?
-Captain.
-What is it?
I find this curious.
Spock, I'm really tired.
We are reading an enormous amount of neutron radiation.
Where?
Strangely enough, it appears to be emanating from us.
The Enterprise?
Valeris, do you know anything about a radiation surge?
Sir?
Chekov?
Only the size of my head.
I know what you mean.
-What's happened?
-We have fired on the Chancellor's ship.
Torpedo Room, please confirm.
Have we fired?
...0-6...
-Uhura, monitor.
-Aye, sir.
Direct hit.
Confirmed, sir.
We've lost gravity!
We are betrayed!
This is the Bridge.
Do you read?
Do you read?
Torpedo bay, did we fire those torpedoes?
Negative, Captain.
According to inventory, we're still fully loaded.
Find Chang.
Unable to confirm or deny firing of two photon torpedoes.
-Hailing frequencies.
-Aye, sir.
Kronos One, this is Enterprise.
Do you read?
Over.
Repeat.
Kronos One... lt's very hard to make out, Captain.
There's been some weapons firing and a lot of shouting.
She is still listing.
She's spinning out of control.
Restoring auxiliary gravity.
Have you not a shred of decency in you, Kirk?
We come in peace, and you blatantly defile that peace.
For that, I shall blow you out of the stars.
-We haven't fired.
-Captain.
According to our databanks, we have, twice.
Captain, they're coming about.
-They're preparing to fire.
-Shields up, Captain?
-Captain, our shields.
-Shields up, Captain?
-Signal our surrender.
-Captain?
We surrender!
-This is Enterprise.
We surrender.
-lf they fire at us
-with our shields down...
-l repeat.
-We surrender.
-...we will not be able to respond.
Repeat.
Enterprise surrenders.
-Are we firing torpedoes?
-l wish I knew.
Well, it sure looks like it.
I'm going aboard.
Spock, you have the conn.
I am responsible for involving you in this. I will go.
No, I'll go.
You'll be responsible for getting me out of this.
We'll not be the instigators of full-scale war on the eve of universal peace.
I'm going, too.
They may need a doctor.
-Perhaps you're right.
-Uhura, tell them we're coming, and tell them we're unarmed.
Aye, sir.
Have you lost your mind?
I give you my word, I don't understand what has happened.
We're here to help.
Follow me.
-Chancellor Gorkon.
-My God.
-What has happened here?
-You dare to feign ignorance?
-What happened?
-With a direct torpedo hit, you crippled our entire gravitational field, and two of your Starfleet crew beamed aboard wearing magnetic boots and did this.
Aren't you carrying a surgeon?
We were until this disgrace.
Well, then for God sakes, man, let me help.
I've got a pulse.
We can move him.
I'm gonna need some light.
Can we get him up on this table?
Hold him.
Hold him while I stabilise him.
I said hold him.
Sweet Jesus.
-Can you...
-Jim, I don't even know his anatomy.
-His wounds are not closing.
-He's killing him!
He's gone into some kind of damned arrest.
Come on, damn it!
Come on!
He's not responding.
Don't let it end this way, Captain.
Under article number 1 84 of your interstellar law, I'm placing you under arrest.
You are charged with assassinating our Chancellor of the High Council.
He tried to save him.
They've been arrested.
Mr Spock, we've got to do something.
I assume command of this ship as of 0230 hours.
Commander Uhura, please notify Starfleet Headquarters.
Tell them precisely what has taken place
-and request instructions.
-Aye, sir.
We cannot allow them to be taken back to Kronos as prisoners.
What do you suggest, Lieutenant?
Opening fire will not retrieve them, and an armed conflict is precisely what the Captain wished to avoid.
We will be able to follow the Captain's movements.
-How did you achieve this, sir?
-Time is precious, Lieutenant.
We must endeavour to piece together what happened here tonight.
According to our databank, this ship fired those torpedoes.
No way.
I sympathise, Mr Scott, but we need evidence.
Please accompany me.
And if we cannot piece together what happened?
-What then, sir?
-ln that case, Mr Chekov, it resides in the purview of the diplomats.
The Chancellor of the High Council is dead!
The result of an unprovoked attack while he travelled to see you under a flag of truce, on a mission of peace.
Captain Kirk was legally arrested for the crime.
May I remind you that he and Dr McCoy boarded Kronos One of their own free will?
None of these facts are in dispute, Mr President.
I have ordered a full-scale investigation.
-ln the meantime...
-ln the meantime, we expect the Federation to abide by the articles of interstellar law, which you claim to cherish.
Kirk and Dr McCoy will stand trial for the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon.
Out of the question.
Ambassador Sarek, there must be some way to extradite these men.
Mr President, I share a measure of personal responsibility in this matter, but I am obliged to confirm my esteemed colleague's legal interpretation.
What is the position of the Romulan government,
Ambassador Nanclus?
I must concur with my colleagues.
But you can't possibly believe that James Kirk assassinated the Chancellor of the High Council.
Mr President, I don't know what to believe.
I'm waiting for your answer, sir.
This president is not above the law.
Report back at once.
Do you copy?
At once.
Enterprise to report back on the double.
Do you read?
At once.
We're to report back at once.
We cannot abandon Captain Kirk and Dr McCoy.
Of course not.
Four hundred years ago on the planet Earth, workers who felt their livelihood threatened by automation flung their wooden shoes called "sabot" into the machines to stop them.
Hence the word "sabotage."
We are experiencing technical malfunction.
All backup systems inoperative.
Excellent. I mean, too bad.
Mr President,
I've been named Chancellor by the High Council in my father's place.
Madam Chancellor, you have my sincerest condolences on your recent loss.
I want to assure you that this shameful deed will not...
Mr President, let us come to the point.
You want this conference to go forward, and so did my father.
I will attend in one week on one condition.
We will not extradite the prisoners, and you will make no attempt to rescue them in a military operation.
We would consider any such attempt an act of war.
We hope you'll be our guest here on Earth.
After recent events, you will understand if I say I prefer a neutral site, and in the interests of security, let us keep the location secret for now.
As you wish, Madam Chancellor.
Attack them now, while we still can!
Attack or be slaves in their world.
We can take whole by force, what they propose to divide.
War is obsolete, General, as we are in danger of becoming.
Better to die on our feet than live on our knees.
That wasn't what my father wanted.
Your father was killed for what he wanted.
The peace process will go forward.
Kirk...
Kirk will pay for my father's death.
-Kirk!
Kirk!
-Kirk!
Kirk!
-Kirk!
Kirk!
Kirk!
Kirk!
-Kirk!
Kirk!
Kirk!
Kirk!
It's a damn show trial.
-Kirk!
Kirk!
-Kirk!
Kirk!
The Enterprise fired on Kronos One without provocation.
The Chancellor and his advisers having been lulled into a false sense of security by an invitation to a state dinner aboard Captain Kirk's vessel at precisely 1 930 hours that same evening.
Call your first witness.
After the first shot, we lost our gravitational field.
I found myself weightless and unable to function.
Then two StarfIeet crewmen came walking towards me.
But perhaps they merely wore StarfIeet uniforms.
That remark is purely speculative.
I move that it be stricken.
colonel Worf, we are interested in facts, not theories.
If the gravitational unit was not functioning, how could these men be walking?
They appeared to be wearing magnetic boots.
Gravity boots.
Dr McCoy, would you be so good as to tell me, what is your current medical status?
Aside from a touch of arthritis, I'd say pretty good.
You have a singular wit, Doctor.
For 27 years, I've been ship surgeon aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise.
In three months, I stand down.
You know, I believe that you consumed a rather generous amount of Romulan ale in the officers' mess on the night in question.
Am I right, Doctor?
-Objection!
-Sustained.
We all did.
All of us.
-That doesn't mean...
-Was Chancellor Gorkon alive when you first examined him?
-Barely.
-Now be careful, Doctor.
Have you ever, in your past, saved patients as barely alive as he?
I didn't have the medical knowledge I needed for Klingon anatomy.
-l see.
-You were there.
You say you are due for retirement.
May I ask, do your hands shake?
-Objection!
-l was nervous.
No.
You were incompetent.
You were incompetent!
Whether deliberately or as a result of age combined with drink,
-the court will have to determine.
-My God, man!
I tried to save him!
I tried to save him.
I was desperate to save him.
He was the last best hope in the universe for peace.
The witness is excused.
There we have it, citizens.
We have finally established the particulars of the crime, and now we come to the architect of this tragic affair,
James Tiberius Kirk.
What would your favourite author say, Captain?
"Let us sit upon the ground
"and tell sad stories of the death of kings."
Tell us your sad story, Kirk.
Tell us that you planned to take revenge for the death of your son.
-That's not true.
-Objection!
Captain Kirk has not been identified as the assassin.
Sustained.
I offer into the record this excerpt from the Captain's personal log.
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I have never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Again.
Again!
I've never trusted Klingons, and I never will.
I have never been able to forgive them for the death of my boy.
Are those your words?
Those words were spoken by me.
Objection!
My client's political views are not on trial here.
On the contrary!
Captain Kirk's views and motives are indeed at the very heart of the matter.
This officer's record shows him to be an insubordinate, unprincipled, career-minded opportunist, with a history of violating the chain of command whenever it suited him!
Continue.
Indeed, the record shows that Captain Kirk once held the rank ofAdmiral, and that Admiral Kirk was broken for taking matters into his own hands in defiance of regulations of the law.
Do you deny being demoted for these charges?
Don't wait for the translation!
Answer me now!
I cannot deny it.
-You were demoted?
-Yes.
-For insubordination?
-On occasion, I have disobeyed orders.
And were you obeying or disobeying orders when you arranged the assassination of Chancellor Gorkon?
I didn't know about the assassination until we boarded the ship.
You still deny the Enterprise fired on Kronos One?
-Well...
-Your Honours, please!
And you still deny your men beamed aboard and shot the Chancellor?
Objection!
I cannot confirm or deny actions I did not witness.
Captain Kirk, are you aware that as the captain of a starship, you are required to be responsible for the actions of your men?
I am.
And if it should be proved that members of your crew did, in fact, carry out such an assassination...
Jim, they're setting us up.
Your Honours...
Do not answer!
Captain Kirk, you will answer the question.
As captain, I am responsible for the conduct of the crew under my command.
Your Honours, the State rests.
Send to Commander Enterprise.
"We stand ready to assist you.
Captain Sulu, U.S.S. Excelsior. "
It is the determination of this court that the prisoners are guilty as charged.
I wish to note for the record that the evidence against my clients is entirely circumstantial.
I beg the court to consider this when pronouncing its sentence.
So noted.
Captain James T. Kirk, Dr Leonard McCoy, in the interest of fostering amity for the forthcoming peace talks, the sentence of death is commuted.
It is the judgement of this court that, without possibility of reprieve or parole, you be taken from this place to the dilithium mines on the penal asteroid of Rura Penthe, there to spend the rest of your natural lives.
Rura Penthe?
Known throughout the galaxy as the aliens' graveyard.
Better to kill them now and get it over with.
Lieutenant, the torpedo hit once again, please.
Hold.
It is Enterprise.
-We fired.
-That is not possible.
All weapons visually accounted for, sir.
An ancestor of mine maintained that if you eliminate the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.
What exactly does that mean?
It means that if we cannot have fired those torpedoes, someone else did.
Well, they did not fire on themselves, and there were no other ships present.
There was an enormous neutron energy surge.
Not from us!
A neutron surge that big could only be produced by another ship.
Kronos One?
Too far away.
Very near us.
Possibly beneath us.
If there were a ship beneath us, the Klingons would have seen her.
Would they?
-A bird-of-prey.
-A bird-of-prey.
Cloaked?
A bird-of-prey cannot fire when she's cloaked.
All things being equal, Mr Scott, I would agree.
However, things are not equal.
This one can.
We must inform Starfleet Command.
Inform them of what, a new weapon that is invisible?
Raving lunatics, that's what they'll call us.
They'll say that we're so desperate to exonerate the Captain that we'll say anything.
And they would be correct.
We have no evidence, only a theory which happens to fit the facts.
Assuming you're right, Mr Spock, why would they fire on their own president?
Indeed.
This ship will be searched from bow to stern.
Lieutenant Valeris, you'll be in charge.
-Aye, sir.
-l do not understand.
If there was a ship underneath us, surely the assassins beamed aboard from that vessel, not Enterprise.
You're forgetting something, Mr Chekov.
According to our databanks, this ship fired those torpedoes.
If we did, the killers are here.
If we did not, whoever altered the databanks is here.
In either case, what we are looking for is here.
What are we looking for, sir?
Lieutenant?
Two pairs of gravity boots.
This is the gulag Rura Penthe.
There is no stockade, no guard tower, no electronic frontier.
Only a magnetic shield prevents beaming.
Punishment means exile from prison to the surface.
On the surface, nothing can survive.
Work well and you will be treated well.
Work badly and you will die.
Oh, my God.
The universal translator's been confiscated.
I'm sorry?
He's definitely on about something, Jim.
If this is your spot, we'll move on.
He wants your obedience to the brotherhood of aliens.
-He's got it.
-And your coat.
I'm afraid not.
Besides, it wouldn't fit.
Thanks.
This will help keep you warm.
I'm Martia.
You're Kirk and McCoy, I presume.
How'd you know that?
We don't get many presidential assassins.
-We didn't kill Gorkon.
-Of course not,
-but there is a reward for your death.
-lt figures.
We've been set up all along.
Somebody up there wants you out of the way.
-Nothing in here.
-Nothing here.
-Any progress?
-None.
We have a crew of 300 turning their own quarters inside out, but the killers may still be among them.
Surely they have disposed of these boots by now.
Would it not have been logical to have left them on Gorkon's ship?
Even logic must give way to physics.
Gravity had not been restored by the time they escaped.
Without the boots, they would have floated off the Klingon transporter pads.
Why not simply vapourize them?
Like this?
At ease.
As you know, Commander Chekov, no one can fire an unauthorised phaser aboard a starship.
Suppose when they returned, they threw the boots into the refuse.
I'm having the refuse searched.
If my surmise is correct, those boots will cling to the killers' necks like a pair of Tiberian bats.
They could not make their escape without them, nor can they simply throw them out the window for all to see.
-Those boots are here somewhere.
-Did someone fire off a phaser?
It's all right. lt's nothing. lt's nothing.
Mr Spock, Starfleet is screaming for us to return to port.
-Who fired that...
-Mr Scott.
I understand you're having difficulty with the warp drive.
How much time do you require for repair?
There's nothing wrong with the bloody thing.
Mr Scott, if we return to spacedock, the assassins will surely find a way to dispose of their incriminating footwear, and we will never see the Captain or Dr McCoy alive again.
-lt could take weeks, sir.
-Thank you, Mr Scott.
Valeris, please inform Starfleet Command
-our warp drive is inoperative.
-A lie?
An error.
You understand we have lost all contact with the Captain and Dr McCoy.
Yes.
At the moment, they're surrounded by a magnetic shield.
However, if I know the Captain, by this time, he is deep into planning his escape.
You got him, Jim!
You got him where you want him!
-You all right, Jim?
-l think so.
-They'll respect you now.
-That's a comfort.
-l was lucky that thing had knees.
-That was not his knee.
Not everybody keeps their genitals in the same place, Captain.
Anything you want to tell me?
Bones, why don't you see what you can do for him?
Let him know we're not holding a grudge.
Suppose he's holding a grudge?
When whoever it is makes their move, you won't be here to ask if he's the one.
-Do you want to get out of here?
-There's gotta be a way.
Three months before retirement.
What a way to finish.
-We're not finished.
-No?
Speak for yourself.
One day, one night, Kobayashi Maru.
Bones, are you afraid of the future?
I believe that was the general idea that I was trying to convey.
I don't mean this future.
-What is this, multiple choice?
-Some people are afraid of what might happen.
I was terrified.
What terrified you, specifically?
No more neutral zone.
I was used to hating Klingons.
It never even occurred to me to take Gorkon at his word.
Spock was right.
Try not to be too hard on yourself.
We all felt exactly the same.
No.
Somebody felt a lot worse.
I'm beginning to understand why.
Well, if you've got any bright ideas, now's the time.
Time's the problem.
You and I are nothing.
But you heard the judge.
The peace conference is on again.
Whoever killed Gorkon is bound to attempt another assassination.
Unless we can get out of here.
Kirk, it's me, Martia.
Listen, no one has ever escaped from Rura Penthe.
-Except us.
-lt is possible.
-l know how to get outside the shield.
-How do we fit in?
Getting outside the shield is easy, but after that, it's up to you to get us off the surface before we freeze.
Can you?
-lt's possible.
-l can't make it alone, and you're likeliest candidate to come in this hellhole for months.
Candidate for what?
Go to lift seven in the morning for mining duty.
I'll see you there.
Don't disappoint me.
-What is it with you, anyway?
-Still think we're finished?
More than ever.
-l'm sorry to wake you, sir.
-What is it?
Starfleet urgently requests any data we have on the whereabouts of Enterprise.
What?
Well, apparently, they're refusing to acknowledge signal to return to spacedock, sir.
Signal Starfleet that we have no idea location Enterprise.
Sir?
-You have hearing problems, mister?
-No, sir.
Klingon blood.
They must have walked through it when it was floating and tracked it back here.
This is the first evidence which corroborates our theory.
Now we go to Starfleet.
Now we expand our search to include uniforms.
All uniforms?
Take those out.
-Continue scanning.
-Nothing, sir.
Clear, sir.
Coming through.
Coming through.
Computer well seven clear.
Nothing.
Nothing.
Okay, let's see what we got.
Nothing.
Nothing so far.
Sir!
Sir!
-l think we've been had.
-No, you weren't, Doctor.
Get off at the first level.
Follow the gang into the mine.
They don't take girls.
You are Crewman Dax?
Yes, Commander.
What is the problem?
Perhaps you know Russian epic of Cinderella?
If shoe fits, wear it.
Mr Chekov.
Watch me.
What kind of creature is this?
Last night, you two were...
Don't remind me.
Get in.
Come on.
We don't have a lot of time.
Hurry.
Up there.
Come on, climb.
Here.
You'll need these.
Quickly!
Stay close.
There they are.
They're emerging from the beaming shield.
-Mr Scott, start your engines.
-Aye, aye, sir.
Mr Chekov, set course for Rura Penthe.
Mr Spock, Rura Penthe is deep inside the Klingon frontier.
-lf we are discovered...
-Quite correct, Mr Chekov.
What is required now is a feat of linguistic legerdemain and a degree of intrepidity before the Captain and Dr McCoy freeze to death.
-Leave me. I'm finished.
-No!
Bones, I'm wearing a viridium patch on my back.
Spock slapped it there just before we went on Gorkon's ship.
-Why, that cunning little Vulcan.
-Come on.
We're in the clear.
Now that we're outside the shield, they'll be able to locate us two sectors away.
If they're even looking for us.
This is listening post Morska.
What ship is that?
Over.
We must respond personally.
A universal translator would be recognised.
We am thy freighter Ursva.
Six weeks out of
Kronos.
What is your destination?
Over.
We is condemning food,
things and supplies.
Don't catch any bugs!
Would you mind explaining that little trick you do?
-l'm a chameloid.
-l've heard about you.
Shapeshifters.
-l thought you were mythical.
-Give a girl a chance, Captain.
-lt takes a lot of effort.
-l don't doubt it.
Stop me if I'm wrong, but do we have any way of knowing whether this is the real you?
I thought I would assume a pleasing shape.
We're outside the shield.
Now it's your turn, Captain.
If you say so.
Are you crazy?
She didn't need our help getting anywhere.
Where'd you get these convenient clothes?
Don't tell me that flare is standard prison issue.
It's to let them know where we are.
Ask her what she's getting in return.
A full pardon, which doesn't cover this.
An accident wasn't good enough.
Come on, Spock.
Good enough for one.
Two would have looked suspicious.
Killed while attempting escape.
Now that's convincing for both.
Surprise!
-Your friends are late.
-They'll be along.
-l can't believe I kissed you.
-Must have been your lifelong ambition.
Isn't it about time you became something else?
I like it here.
Well, well, well.
What took you so long?
-Kill him.
He's the one.
-Not me, you idiot.
Him!
-No witnesses.
-Killed while trying to escape.
-Damn clever, if you ask me.
-lt's a classic.
-That's what he wanted.
-Who?
Who wanted us killed?
Since you're all going to die anyway, why not tell you?
His name is...
Damn it to hell!
Of all the...
Son of a...
-Couldn't you have waited two seconds?
-Captain?
He was just about to explain the whole thing.
You want to go back?
-Absolutely not!
-lt's cold.
This is the Bridge.
We are still in Klingon space.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
Deck 9, remain at battle stations.
They were beamed aboard a Federation starship.
I could trace...
Escaped.
Kirk cannot know the location of the peace conference.
Are you sure?
Will you take that chance?
Helmsman, make course to intercept Enterprise.
The Klingons have a new weapon, a bird-of-prey that can fire when cloaked.
-She torpedoed Gorkon's ship.
-So that's it.
Not entirely. I have reason to believe that Gorkon's murderers
-are aboard this vessel.
-l have a thought about that.
Has the peace conference begun?
Who knows?
They're keeping the location secret.
-There's always something.
-Captain!
Mr Spock!
I found the missing uniforms with the Klingon blood on them.
But the uniforms belong to these two men,
Burke and Samno.
Not any more.
Phaser on stun at close range.
First rule of assassination, kill the assassins.
-Now we're back to square one.
-Can I talk to you?
I wonder why they weren't vapourized.
It would set off the alarm.
It's possible.
Now hear this.
Now hear this.
Court reporter to sickbay.
Code Blue.
Urgent.
Statements to be taken at once from yeomen Burke and Samno.
Repeat.
Court reporter to sickbay.
Code Blue.
Urgent.
Statements to be taken.
Repeat.
Statements to be taken from yeomen Burke and Samno.
You have to shoot.
If you are logical, you have to shoot.
I do not want to.
What you want is irrelevant.
What you've chosen is at hand.
I'd just as soon you didn't.
The operation is over.
I did not fire.
You cannot prove anything.
Yes, I can.
At my trial, my personal log was used against me.
How long did you wait outside my quarters before I noticed you?
You knew?
I tried to tell you, but you would not listen.
Neither of us was hearing very well that night, Lieutenant.
There were things I tried to tell you about having faith.
You have betrayed the Federation.
All of you.
And what do you think you've been doing?
Saving Starfleet.
Klingons cannot be trusted.
Sir.
You said so yourself.
They killed your son.
Did you not wish Gorkon dead?
"Let them die," you said.
Did I misinterpret you?
And you were right.
They conspired with us to assassinate their own chancellor.
How trustworthy can they be?
Klingons and Federation members conspiring together?
Who is "us"?
Everyone who stands to lose from peace.
-Names, Lieutenant.
-My comrades will make certain all your ship-to-shore transmissions are jammed.
Names, Lieutenant.
I do not remember.
A lie?
A choice.
Spock?
Admiral Cartwright.
From Starfleet?
Who else?
-General...
-General...
-...
Chang.
-...
Chang.
Who else?
-Romulan...
-Romulan...
-...
Ambassador...
-...
Ambassador...
-...
Nanclus.
-...
Nanclus.
Where is the peace conference?
She does not know.
Then we're dead.
I've been dead before.
Contact Excelsior.
-She'll have the coordinates.
-l've already got him, sir.
Standing by, Captain Kirk.
Sulu!
You realise that by even talking to us, you're violating regulations.
I'm sorry, Captain.
Your message is breaking up.
Bless you, Sulu.
Where is the peace conference?
They're going to attempt another assassination.
The conference is at Camp Khitomer, near the Romulan border.
I'm sending the exact coordinates on a coded frequency.
I'm afraid we're gonna need more than that.
There's a bird-of-prey on the lookout for us, and she can fire while cloaked.
Surely not.
Hold on.
How many of those things are there?
Come on, Lieutenant.
-Just the prototype.
-You hear that?
I'm getting underway now, but we're now in Alpha Quadrant.
The chances of our reaching the conference in time are slim.
When does this conference start?
According to my information, today.
Thank you, Captain Sulu.
Don't mention it, Captain Kirk.
Spock?
I prefer it dark.
Dining on ashes?
You were right.
It was arrogant presumption on my part that got us into this situation.
You and the doctor might have been killed.
The night is young.
You said it yourself. lt was logical.
Peace is worth a few personal risks.
You're a great one for logic.
I'm a great one for rushing in where angels fear to tread.
We're both extremists.
Reality is probably somewhere in between.
I couldn't get past the death of my son.
I was prejudiced by her accomplishments as a Vulcan.
Gorkon had to die before I understood how prejudiced I was.
is it possible that we two, you and I, have grown so old and so inflexible that we have outlived our usefulness?
Would that constitute a joke?
Don't crucify yourself.
It wasn't your fault.
I was responsible.
-For no actions but your own.
-That is not what you said at your trial.
That was as captain of the ship.
Human beings...
But, Captain, we both know that I am not human.
Spock, you want to know something?
Everybody's human.
I find that remark insulting.
Come on. I need you.
Madam chancellor, members of the Diplomatic Corps, honoured guests,
the United Federation of Planets welcomes you to Camp Khitomer.
She's out here somewhere.
But if she is cloaked...
Then all we have is a neutron radiation surge, and by the time we're close enough to record it, we're ashes.
209.
206.
203.
-Close enough to beam down?
-Not yet, Captain. ln two minutes. 1 58.
-Go to impulse power for Khitomer orbit.
-Aye, sir.
Let us redefine progress to mean thatjust because we can do a thing, it does not necessarily follow that we must do that thing.
-Uhura?
-Nothing, Captain.
If she's here, she's rigged for silent running.
Coming up on transporter range in 57 seconds.
Transporter Room, stand by to beam down.
...53 48 seconds.
...44... I can see you, Kirk.
Chang.
Can you see me?
Now, be honest, Captain.
Warrior to warrior, you do prefer it this way, don't you?
As it was meant to be.
No peace in our time.
"Once more unto the breach, dear friends."
-This is fun.
-Reverse engines.
All astern.
One and a half impulse power.
Back off!
Back off!
What's she doing?
What's she waiting for?
Probably attempting to ascertain why we are reversing, wondering whether we detect her.
Incoming!
-ln range?
-Not yet, sir.
Come on.
Come on.
-She'll fly apart.
-Fly her apart, then!
Many speculated about my father's motives.
There were those who said he was an idealist.
Others said he had no choice.
If Praxis had not exploded, then quite possibly his idealism would not have found expression.
We are a proud race, and we are here because we intend to go on being proud.
-Go to auxiliary power!
-Auxiliary circuits destroyed, Captain.
"Tickle us, do we not laugh?
Prick us, do we not bleed?
"Wrong us,
"shall we not revenge?"
Gas.
Gas, Captain.
Under impulse power, she expends fuel like any other vessel.
We call it plasma, but whatever the Klingon designation, it is merely ionized gas.
Well, what about all of that equipment we're carrying to catalogue gaseous anomalies?
-Well, the thing's gotta have a tailpipe.
-Doctor, would you care to assist me
-in performing surgery on a torpedo?
-Fascinating.
Hard to starboard!
The proposed agenda is as follows.
The total evacuation of Kronos has been calculated within the 50-Earth-year time span.
Phase one, preparation for evacuation.
Come on, reach up!
Captain!
She's packing quite a wallop!
Shields weakening!
Shields up.
All right.
Now we've given them something else to shoot at.
Aye, sir.
The game's afoot, huh?
-Excelsior's been hit.
-"Our revels now are ended," Kirk.
"Cry 'Havoc!
' and let slip the dogs of war."
Bones, where's my torpedo?
Bet you wish you'd stood in bed.
Emergency power!
Gravity control down!
Shields collapsing!
The key, please, Doctor.
Time is short.
The hull has been compromised.
-l wonder how bad?
-Connect echobars.
...to discuss the report on phase two.
-Alter circuit "A."
-Sensor.
I propose that we commence with the minutes of the preparation.
"I am constant as the northern star."
I'd give real money if he'd shut up.
-Plate, please.
-Plate.
...and assimilation will consume...
We've got a heartbeat.
The Klingon empire, the ecological...
-Key, please.
-Key.
Where's that damn torpedo?
She's ready, Jim.
Lock and load.
Fire.
To be, or not to be.
Target that explosion and fire.
Fire.
As I imagine this work will occupy us throughout most of the week, it would be my hope that the delegation could return to their capitals to implement the provisions of phase one, no later than the first of next month.
Scotty.
As you know, time is of the essence.
-Out of the way!
-Out of the way!
Mr President!
Mr President!
Mr President!
Mr President!
Kirk, Enterprise.
Protect the Chancellor!
-Arrest those men!
-Arrest yourself.
We've got a full confession.
Cartwright, just a minute.
What's happened?
What's the meaning of all of this?
It's about the future, Madam Chancellor.
Some people think the future means the end of history.
Well, we haven't run out of history quite yet.
Your father called the future the undiscovered country.
People can be very frightened of change.
You've restored my father's faith.
And you've restored my son's.
Once again, we've saved civilisation as we know it.
And the good news is, they're not going to prosecute.
They might as well have prosecuted me.
I felt like Lieutenant Valeris.
Well, they don't arrest people for having feelings.
And it's a good thing, too. lf they did, we'd all have to turn ourselves in.
Captain Kirk.
Captain Sulu.
As much to the crew of the Enterprise, I owe you my thanks.
Nice to see you in action one more time, Captain Kirk.
Take care.
By God, that's a big ship.
-Not so big as her captain, I think.
-So, this is goodbye.
I think it's about time we got underway ourselves.
Captain, I have orders from Starfleet Command.
We're to put back to spacedock immediately to be decommissioned.
If I were human, I believe my response would be,
"Go to hell."
If I were human.
Course heading, Captain?
Second star to the right, and straight on till morning.
Captain's Log, Stardate 9529.1 .
This is the final cruise ofthe Starship Enterprise under my command.
This ship and her history will shortly become the care of another crew.
To them and their posterity will we commit our future.
They will continue the voyages we have begun, and journey to all the undiscovered countries, boldly going where no man...

[SPLINTER] Faster, Leonardo.
Higher leaps, Raphael.
Sweeping motions, Michelangelo.
Yes, now you have the proper technique.
Man, don't you just hate spring cleaning?
Wash the windows, scrub the floors, save the world.
My entire life is work, work, work.
Master Splinter, how come Donatello gets to cop out on this housecleaning bit?
Donatello has been excused to allow him to study for his upcoming exam in binary cyberion generators.
[RAPHAEL] That old excuse again?
Ah, there.
My final exam is completed.
Now to mail it to the correspondence school.
This is the toughest part of this correspondence course.
(HORN HONKING)
(CLOCK TICKING)
Hey, give it a rest, Donatello.
Pacing back and forth won't get the mail delivered any sooner.
I can't help it, Raphael.
Today's the day I find out if I got my degree.
Is this what you've been waiting for?
I don't believe it!
It's from Professor Sopho himself.
Who's Professor Sopho?
He's only the head of the entire university.
He says I've graduated with the highest grades ever.
Yeah!
Outrageous, dude!
Hey, and listen to this.
I've been invited to the university to receive my degree in person.
Yeah?
Well, I hope you got the right dress for the occasion.
Dress?
It's addressed to "Miss Donna Tello."
Whoa, it looks like the prof's expecting a dudette, not a dude, dude.
Definitely not a turtle.
Too bad, Donatello.
I guess you'll just have to forget about any personal appearances.
Yeah, tough tortillas, bud.
No way.
I've worked too hard for that degree.
I deserve it!
But how could I get it?
How?
Hold everything!
I just thought of a way.
And nobody has to know.
Attention, homeowners.
Is your house burglar-proof?
Take it from me.
Every household needs the nation's number one alarm system.
I'd rather use a number nine frying pan.
Whoa!
Donatello?
Irma, I must talk to you!
Hey, drop in anytime.
I need your help in picking up my degree at a university.
Why me?
Because they think I'm a Miss instead of a Mr.
What do you say, huh?
Will you pretend to be me?
Gee, I don't think so.
But, Irma, you'll love it.
It's on a beautiful lake.
Oh, forget it.
I get seasick.
It's surrounded by pine trees and flowers.
I've also got allergies.
And the campus is crawling with eligible men.
What are we waiting for?
Let's get going.
Now, remember.
From now on, your name is Donna Tello.
Donna Tello.
I kind of like that name.
I might even keep it when this whole thing is over.
[CONDUCTOR] All out for Sopho University!
That's us, Irma.
I mean, "Donna."
So now what do I do?
You wait for someone to pick you up.
I'm not that kind of a girl.
Miss Tello?
[DONATELLO] Psst, that's you!
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah!
That's me!
Professor Sopho has requested we drive you to the university.
Ouch!
Did you say "ouch?"
No, no, no, no.
I said "out."
It's so nice to be out in the country.
Here we are, dear old Sopho U.
My, what big buildings you have.
The better to teach you with, my dear.
Oh, brother.
April O'Neil, get in here!
You bellowed, Mr. Thompson?
There's something mysterious going on at Bottomless Lake upstate.
Bottomless Lake?
Suddenly, thousands of fish are overflowing the lake.
I want you to get up there pronto.
Sounds dangerous, chief.
Maybe I should go along just in case there's trouble.
Oh, good idea, Vernon.
Good, good, good, good.
Some of those minnows might be might fierce.
Fierce minnows?
On second thought,
I better stick around here and guard the home front.
Too late, Vernon.
You've made your river bed, now lie in it.
We're here, Donatello.
It's safe to come out now.
[GROANS]
Next time I travel in a trunk,
I'm shipping myself "first class, fragile, this end up."
Miss Tello?
It's Professor Sopho.
May I come in?
Just a moment-- I mean, uh... [high-pitched voice] Just a moment.
You're on your own.
Please don't blow it.
Welcome, Miss Tello.
I'm honored to have you here at my university.
Honored?
Honest?
Oh, yes.
It's not often that I meet someone with your incredible scientific knowledge.
[GIGGLES]
I'll bet you say that to all us unbelievably brilliant geniuses.
I'm beginning to think this was a big mistake.
Here's your lunch, Miss Tello.
We prepared your favorite dish.
Ta-da!
Pizzas?
It's right here on your application.
"List your three favorite foods."
"Pizza, pizza, and more pizza."
[LAUGHS]
I've had it up to here with all this housecleaning.
When do we get to stop?
When the lair is clean enough for Master Splinter's liking.
Hey, dudes.
Work's a cinch when you do it to a cool beat.
Ha ha!
Whoa!
Or in this case, a warm soapy one.
And this is the very latest version of a binary hexi-decimal retrieval transducer.
But of course with your scientific expertise, you knew that right away.
Hey, you can't fool a whiz kid like me when it comes to biolateral translucents.
[GROANS] She blew it.
[LAUGHS]
A sense of humor, too.
I like that in a brilliant scientist.
Whew.
That was close.
Now, come, my dear.
Let me show you the rest of the university, hmm?
Hmm.
There's something weird going on here.
Why does a university need a hexi-decimal transducer?
Hey, you!
What are you doing here?
Me?
Oh.
I'm here for the costume party.
How do you guys like my turtle outfit?
There's something fishy about this reptile.
I say we cook his goose.
[LAUGHS] You two wimps?
You gotta be joking.
If we're joking, you're about to die laughing.
Whoever you are, get ready to say "bye-bye" in turtle talk.
Do you mind is I go first?
Oh, be my guest.
All right, wise guy.
Try this on for size.
[CHUCKLES] I can tell from here it won't fit.
[VERNON] Burne was right.
There's so many fish in this lake, there's barely any room for the water.
Vernon, this could be the scoop of the year.
Start unloading the equipment.
Here's all the equipment I'll need.
Fishing equipment.
Vernon!
Come back!
We've got a story to cover!
I've already got the story.
"Heroic newsman catches record batch of fish.
Film at 11."
Whoa!
Vernon!
Oh, no!
I can't let him out of my sight for a second!
Aah!
Whoa!
Vernon!
Can I do anything?
I think I need mouth-to-mouth resuscitation.
What ever you say, Vernon.
Here.
Wha--wha--
[SPITS]
Whew.
Finally finished housecleaning.
Until next spring, that is.
It does the fax Max.
Max has been acting totally freaked lately.
Yeah, well, you know what they say,
"The nut doesn't fall far from the shell."
Have any of you seen Donatello?
No, Master, not for hours.
If I know that dude, he's probably hanging out at the library.
Actually, Michelangelo's right.
I am hanging out at the library.
There's something oh so phony about Sopho U, and I intend to find out what it is.
On these walls you'll find every book ever written on every field of science known to man.
[IRMA] Ahem!
And of course...women.
That's more like it.
I assume you've read Stienman's treatises on magnetronic circuitries of the filamentary synchronizing indoctrascope.
Well, actually, I was waiting for the movie.
Uh-oh.
Whoa!
A turtle saved by a bunch of fish.
Is that poetic justice or what?
This whole setup gets fishier by the--whoa--minute.
I'm more convinced than--uhh--ever that there's something-- whoa-- slippery about this Sopho guy.
I'm worried, dudes.
Maxwell is acting totally stressed.
Maybe all those pizza crumbs are making him hyper.
No possible way.
I always scrape off the anchovies.
He's headed for the sewer!
Wait!
Max!
Where you going?
Come back!
Quick, Raphael.
We've gotta rescue him.
You mean Michelangelo or Maxwell?
Michelangelo!
Hang on!
We'll save youuuuuuu!
Well, that's it, Miss Tello.
You've now seen the entire university.
So what do you think?
It's so...
I--I just don't know.
What's the word?
So universal.
Speaking of the universe,
I have a rather earthshaking announcement to make at this evening's award ceremony.
And it involves you.
Me?
What sort of announcement?
[LAUGHS] A genius like yourself should have already guessed.
Until then, au revoir.
An announcement that involves me.
I wonder what he could mean by that.
A giant galvanometric oscilloscope?
Oh, this baby's big enough to change the molecular vibrations of the earth's core.
Which explains all those fish in the lake.
They must have been attracted by the high-magnetic frequency.
But how is Sopho planning to use it?
I don't believe it!
Sopho is planning to use the giant oscilloscope to fling every creature from the face of the earth and leave it as bald as his own head.
I gotta do something about this.
But first I've gotta find Irma and warn her.
[BEEP] Uh-oh.
Oh, great.
A cybernetic security system.
Ha ha!
Missed me!
Whoa!
Looks like I spoke too soon.
Whoa!
I gotta get out of this thing.
But how?
Uhh!
Well, that's one way of doing it.
Ha!
You gotta be quicker than that to catch me.
Up here, fella!
Yoo-hoo!
[SIGHS] Now to find Irma and warn her.
Fellow scientists, welcome to Sopho U's graduation exercises.
I have an announcement that will change the entire world as we know it.
But first, please relax and enjoy your dinner.
It will probably be your last meal on earth.
What's that, Professor?
Oh--ahem-- I said...
"Let's all have a great deal of mirth."
This waiters outfit wasn't a bad idea.
I might even pick up a few tips.
There's Irma.
But how can I talk to her when she's sitting right next to Sopho?
And why am I talking to myself?
I know.
I'll write her a note.
"Irma...
Big trouble.
You must leave now!"
Signed...
D.
Why, Miss Tello, you've barely touched your Sopho soufflé.
On my diet, soufflé is a definite no-no.
Perhaps a sandwich would be more to the lady's liking.
That was a note!
You were supposed to read it, not eat it.
I thought it was sliced awfully thin.
And that concludes our report on the fish-infested phenomenon of Bottomless Lake.
This is April O'Neil signing off.
Okay, Vernon, that's a wrap.
Let's head back.
What's your hurry, dudette?
We just got here.
The Turtles.
How did you get here?
By way of the sewer system.
Yeah, we took the scenic route.
Where's Donatello?
We haven't the foggiest notion.
I really miss that brainiac.
I'll be he could tell us what's going on here.
Hey, the important thing is my little bud Maxwell is okay.
[BURNE] April!
Vernon!
Are you still there at the lake?
Yes, chief, What's up?
Professor Sopho has contacted all the media that he's about to make a big, big, big, big announcement.
And I want you to cover it.
[APRIL] That's his university right there.
Okay, chief.
We're on our way.
Irma, you've got to get out of here.
This Sopho guy is a real crackpot.
Crackpot?
A whacko.
A nutcase.
A walking loony bin.
Oh, come on, Donatello.
All geniuses are a little eccentric.
Maybe you're just jealous that someone has finally recognized my superior intellect.
Hey.
Whoa.
Sopho thinks you're me, remember?
It was my brain power that got you here.
Then how come I've got the feeling he's going to offer me a job?
No, Irma!
Wait!
So, it's you again.
The turtle.
I'm warning you.
I may be green, but I'm also mean.
But now you're bagged and you're also snagged.
We'll stay here while you and Vernon check out this Professor Sopho story.
That's cool with me and Max.
These eggheads can be drier than a year-old pizza.
Look, Vernon, it's Irma.
What's she doing here?
[VERNON] I think we're about to find out.
And now, fellow scientists, the announcement you've all been waiting to hear.
I have selected Miss Donna Tello, a woman whose genius matches my own... almost... to be my partner in a momentous scientific experiment.
[APPLAUSE]
Why did he call her "Miss Donna Tello?"
Better question:
Why would he want her to be his partner?
Together, we will create achievements undreamed of by ordinary mortals.
[CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
Irma, what's this all about?
April, did you hear the news?
I'll bet when Burne Thompson hears about this job offer, he'll start to appreciate me.
Professor, this is my best friend April.
Is it okay if she becomes a third partner?
Definitely not!
There's only room for the two of us!
Sorry, April!
I tried!
Where are we going?
I want you to witness the surprise
I have planned for the scientific world.
While you and I are safely ensconced in my subterranean laboratory, my galvanometric oscilloscope will spin all those inferior beings from the face of the earth!
Then you and I shall return to the surface as its supreme rulers!
Oh, boy.
Donatello was right.
You are a nutcase.
Perhaps you'd like the honor of speeding up the earth.
I'd rather kiss a water buffalo.
You!
What are you doing?
[ELEVATOR DINGS] Bye!
Ha ha!
See if I care!
Then I'll rule the world without you!
And don't bother trying to shut off the oscilloscope.
I'm setting it on permanent spin cycle!
[GRUNTS] I've got to get free somehow.
Donatello, you were right.
I'm not a genius.
I'm a jerk.
Oh, Irma.
It's not the end of the world.
But it will be if we don't figure out a way to stop this oscilloscope.
Whoa!
Righteous light show.
Mother Nature can't decide whether it's night or day.
This is serious.
Something is speeding up the earth's rotation.
[YELLING]
April's in there.
We've got to get to her.
This is April O'Neil with the 6 P.M. News.
Make that 6 A.M. News.
No.
Um...
6 P.M. News.
Quick, April.
You've got to get out of here.
We can't leave without Irma.
She's still in the lab with Donatello.
Donatello?
Here?
So that's where the dude's been hanging out.
Uhh!
It's no use, Irma.
I'll never get out of these chains.
Remember what Master Splinter taught us.
Never say never.
Leonardo.
Raphael.
Michelangelo.
How did you fellas get here?
Simple.
We just swam upstream with the rest of the salmon.
Quick.
We've got to get inside this thing and turn if off.
Ta-da!
Wish me luck.
Well?
Can you shut it down?
Not without special tools.
Let me have a look.
Hold on.
Maybe we have the right tool after all.
[IRMA] A hairpin?
[BIRDS CHIRPING]
[ALL CHEERING]
Well, what do you know?
I guess I have a head for science after all.
And Professor Sopho and his two accomplices have been arrested and charged with world-wide revolution.
You have done well, my students.
Especially you, Donatello.
Thanks, Sensei.
I guess I really earned this degree.
But the best part of all is that my finny-little bud Maxwell is back to normal again.
Ouch!
Maybe he's not so normal after all.
Like anything bad attached to Michelangelo could be normal?
I am your leader!
You are my pet!
You will let go of my finger!
Sit!
Heel!
Let go!

[Donatello] Come on, guys, wake up.
I've got my latest invention working.
I've been up all night perfecting it.
[yawn]
Yeah, thanks for the news flash, Ace.
Can we go back to sleep now?
No.
Come and see it.
Oh, we'd better go look, Raphael, or there'll be no living with him.
My automatic Easter egg machine.
I simply put raw eggs in one end of the machine, and voilá, Easter eggs come out the other.
No muss, no fuss, no Easter egg dye on your hands.
Wait.
Let me guess.
You volunteered us to color Easter eggs for Channel 6's annual Easter egg hunt.
Egg-zactly.
Okay, if we're gonna start with these rotten egg jokes,
I am out of here.
Let us know when you need more eggs.
We'll go get 'em.
Hey, thanks, Leonardo.
You set an egg-zample for us all.
Donatello.
[yawn]
Far out, dude.
What's this gizmo do?
Look out, Michelangelo!
Whoa!
Hold on, Michelangelo!
I'll turn it off!
[choking]
Help!
Get me off this thing!
Whoa!
I guess it needs a little fine tuning.
You're right.
I prefer my eggs over easy.
[Krang] Shredder!
Come and see my latest invention!
A TV remote control?
Someone has already invented that, Krang.
Don't be ridiculous.
All my inventions look like TV remote controls, but this one I call my Docilizer.
Any Earthling who gets zapped by my Docilizer ray will instantly become timid and obedient.
Hmm.
Interesting.
The people of Earth would be easy to conquer.
Bebop!
Rocksteady!
Ain't this great, boss?
I've always loved cute little bunny rabbits.
I even like big ugly bunny rabbits.
Oh, have you turned my mutants into rabbits?
Of course not.
They are wearing disguises in order to test my device.
It is Easter time on Earth.
No one will suspect two Easter Bunnies of any evil intent.
Yeah--[snort].
We're going undercover.
You expect these two dumb bunnies to test your device?
Once I have tested the Docilizer ray,
I will direct a super-powerful ray through this microwave transmitting tower, zapping the entire population, and they'll all become subservient, frightened creatures.
Where are you carrying out this test?
Channel 6!
Ha ha!
On April O'Neil and her friends, of course!
Oh, that is good.
The whole city will watch as their favorite news team starts acting like timid rabbits.
And when we've conquered the city,
I will personally take care of those Turtles.
Into the portal, and hop to it.
Ooh, if this episode is gonna be full of rabbit jokes,
I'm out of here.
[April] You've got to help me out, Mr. Thompson.
Me in a bunny suit?
No way.
No, no, no.
The guy I hired to play the bunny for the Channel 6 Easter egg hunt didn't show.
Ha.
I don't blame him.
But, Chief, all those children are going to be disappointed if there's no Easter Bunny.
Oh, I've got to find somebody.
New outfit, April?
Ha ha!
Love the ears.
Wait, Vernon!
Forget it, April.
The answer is no.
But think of the children.
I am not gonna hop around Central Park in a bunny suit, handing out Easter eggs.
A man in my position can't afford to look undignified.
Help!
[crash]
Ooh!
Ahh!
Ow!
Whoa!
[giggling] You're right, Vernon.
Your position is undignified enough as it is.
Mommy, look!
There are two Easter Bunnies!
Can I have an egg, Mr. Bunny?
Can I, huh?
Can I?
Ah, get away, kid.
You bother me.
Hey, why don't you goons pick on somebody your own size?
Sure.
Wai-ai-ai-ait!
Don't hurt me!
Well, hey, that Docilizer really works.
Yeah.
Let's go turn everybody at Channel 6 into a bunch of scaredycats.
Uh, are they g-g-gone?
What happened to you, mister?
Uh, I don't know.
But you don't happen to have any, uh, carrots in there, do you?
Here's some more eggs for your Easter egg hunt.
They're not cooked yet.
Thanks, Mildred.
We'll boil them later.
Easter greetings, everybody!
Wow.
You've got two Easter Bunnies, April.
Did they scrape the bottom of the rabbit pen for these two!
It's Rocksteady and Bebop!
Aah!
Aw, gee, these disguises don't fool nobody.
I've got to warn the Turtles.
That automatic Easter egg machine sure got the job done fast.
Yeah, once we got Michelangelo away from it.
Now we have to get these eggs to Channel 6.
[skidding] Preferably unscrambled.
[beeping]
Donatello here.
What's up, April?
Rocksteady and Bebop are here, and they've got some kind of ray device.
We'll be right there.
Step on it, Leonardo.
[Raphael] Oh, there go the eggs.
Peekaboo!
We see you!
Ha ha ha ha!
No!
I--I feel so strange.
W-What's happening to me?
I--I feel strange, too, f-fr-frightened.
Ohh...why, I even frighten myself.
What's going on here?
Who invited you into the newsroom?
We invited ourselves.
Ohh...really?
Well, that's just super.
Okay by me.
Neato.
Ha ha ha ha!
That wonderful thing works!
I can't wait to see the entire world turned into timid rabbitlike creatures.
Think of it:
my own petting zoo.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
[quivering]
Oh, look!
It's the Easter mutants!
[screaming]
What have you done to our friends?
Wow.
Th-Th-The Ninja Turtles.
The Turtles?
Let's zap 'em.
Ha ha ha!
What a trick:
turning turtles timid.
Ha ha ha ha!
Hey!
No!
Watch it with that thing!
[quivering]
What is that ray?
I don't know, but I don't feel anything.
Hey, Krang, we got them Turtles docilized.
No, you don't, you idiot!
The Docilizer doesn't work on mutants!
Uh-oh.
Uh-oh.
Now what, guys?
Now this!
Ohh, no!
Put me down!
Drop your weapons, Turtles, or the wimp gets hurt.
All right.
Just let Vernon go.
Ha.
Sure.
Help!
Get me out of here!
Now it's your turn, shell-backs.
[ring] Yeah, boss?
You've done your job.
Get out of there!
Aw, but, boss, we was gonna have some fun with the Turtles.
I'm the only one who gets to have fun.
Get out now!
Oh, boy.
Someday we're gonna have our own show.
Yeah.
Then we'll be the boss of Shredder.
They're getting away!
Never mind.
We've got bigger things to worry about.
[quivering]
[Rocksteady] Ooh-ooh!
Let's go zap some more people and scare 'em, Bebop!
Uh, yeah.
Ha ha--[snort]
Ain't this the life, though?
My portable spectrascope captured a sample of that ray Rocksteady and Bebop zapped us with.
What is it?
I need to get this sample to my workshop.
Whatever it is, it's making our friends afraid of everything.
Well?
Well, I've isolated the Docilizer ray, and the only way to neutralize effects is to use a siranium crystal refractor.
Oh, no problemo, dude.
There's probably one around here somewhere.
Wrong, Michelangelo.
The siranium crystal is so rare, there's not one in our entire dimension.
What about someone else's dimension?
Well, I've been looking with my dimensional scanner.
If there's a siranium crystal out there anywhere, we'll find it.
I think we're in luck.
What dimension is that?
The sky is falling!
The sky is falling!
That Chicken Little, what a nut.
Now where are those Three Little Pigs?
[squealing]
There they go!
Come back, or I'll blow all your houses down!
[Michelangelo] Holy guacamole!
That was The Big Bad Wolf!
You've tuned into some fairy tale dimension.
That's where the crystal is, guys.
I've managed to get my portable portal generator going.
I'm going in after that crystal.
Wait, Leonardo, it's dangerous.
This dimension portal is very weak.
I don't know how long I can keep it open.
You might not get back out.
We've got a newsroom full of people acting like timid rabbits, and Krang and Shredder are gonna make even more of 'em.
We have to take the chance.
I'll go with ya.
Say, how do we find this siranium crystal?
I'll track it with the spectrascope.
When I find it, I'll contact you on your turtlecom.
Turtle power!
The Docilizer worked at Channel 6, Krang.
Now we need to blast all of Earth with it.
Patience, Shredder.
I need control of that microwave tower first.
I'll broadcast a megadose of my Docilizer ray over the entire city.
And for that, we need to break in to the microwave control center to reprogram the computer.
What is the location of this microwave control center?
There, right outside the city.
Get Bebop and Rocksteady out of those ridiculous bunny suits and take them with you.
I'm on my way.
And soon, everyone on Earth will be acting like quivering, timid little rabbits.
Keep your eyes open, Raphael.
I've got a feeling anything can happen here.
Rub-a-dub-dub, three men in a tub.
I think the sewers might be safer.
[Boy] Timber!
Duck, Raphael!
Sorry about that, fellas.
It was time for the beanstalk chopping, every hour on the hour.
Beanstalk?
Oh, you must be Jack.
At your service.
Hi.
Heh heh.
But why do you have to cut the beanstalk every hour?
It's for the tourists.
They love it.
Now I know the sewers are safer.
[panting]
I got you this time, Tortoise!
Now wait just a dang minute here.
No wonder I could never beat you in a race.
There's two of you!
Who are you?
The name's Hokum Hare, and we don't take kindly to cheating tortoises in these here parts.
You're the hare from The Tortoise and the Hare.
Right.
The loser.
That's right, tortoise.
Kick a hare when he's down.
[thumping]
What's going on?
It's the giant!
I thought Jack took care of him.
No.
That's just a fairy tale.
But falling off that beanstalk every hour gets him mighty riled!
Oh, man.
Why do I get the feeling we're about to wind up as green globs on this guy's shoe?
I think it's time for a tactical turtle retreat.
[beeping]
Answer your turtlecom.
I've seen enough of this place.
I hear it, but I can't find it.
Too late.
He already did.
Ha ha ha ha!
Uh, finders keepers.
A new toy for my treasure box.
Oh, boy.
[Donatello] Leonardo.
Raphael.
Come in.
Can you hear me?
They're not answering.
And the portal is getting weaker by the minute.
Leonardo, Raphael, where are you?
Come in!
Come in!
Come in, Leonardo, Raphael.
Forget it, dude.
They're not answering.
Move that lever on the portable portal generator to full, Michelangelo, and hurry.
Whoa.
It sounds like this thing is about to wipe out.
We've got to chance it.
I've zeroed in on the location of the siranium crystal.
Come on, guys, answer that turtlecom.
There's the giant's castle.
We've got to get that turtlecom back, or we'll never find that crystal.
I ain't letting them turtles out of my sight.
They ain't taking no shortcuts this time.
Fee Fi Fo Fum,
I smell the blood of a-- turtle?
Uh-oh.
H-H-H-Hi, there, big fella.
Ha.
Nice tie.
You're just the person we wanted to see.
Uhhn?
Speak for yourself, Raphael.
[quivering]
This is April O'Neil--
I don't want to do this-- with an on-the-scene report on the strange ray--
I'd rather be hiding under my desk-- uh, that has turned many of us into--
Oh, my goodness-- timid, frightened people!
Aah!
As you can see--
Oh, my!
...this reporter is suffering from the effects of the ray.
Ohh!
We done a great job, Bebop!
Heh heh.
Yeah.
Look at 'em hiding like big chickens.
Aah!
Aah!
Ohh!
Aah!
It's the boss.
Yeah.
Maybe we'll get a promotion for this.
I have a scoop for your audience, Miss O'Neil.
May I?
Whatever you want.
Just don't hurt me!
Ahem.
Soon Krang will microwave a Docilizer beam down to Earth, and you will all be turned into timid, frightened creatures like Miss O'Neil here.
Microwaves: they aren't just for cooking anymore.
Ha ha ha ha ha!
That's one rude dude.
Wait a minute.
Shredder said something about microwaves.
Yeah.
Shred-head said they're not just for cooking anymore.
No, not that.
He said Krang would microwave the Docilizer ray to Earth.
That means he has to use a microwave transmission center.
Look, this is the city's largest microwave tower, and I'll bet he's headed there right now.
Well, come on, dude, let's stop those creepazoids.
Right.
We'll bring the portable portal generator with us to stay in contact with Leonardo and Raphael.
But what if our buds can't find that crystal?
Oh, as you say, no problemo.
If they don't, the Earth is doomed.
No problemo?
Ah, now time to count my treasures.
Fee fi fo fum--
Whoa!
Whoa!
Playtime!
Goody-goody!
[Donatello] Hey, guys, where are you?
It's Donatello!
Maybe he's located that crystal.
We've got to answer it.
Oof!
Hey!
That's mine.
Finders keepers.
Ah, finally.
You guys sure took your sweet--time!
Oh, there's another turtle inside.
Come here, little turtle.
His attention's diverted.
Now's our chance.
Wah-kah-yah!
Now to get the turtlecom.
Ya-hah!
Hey, what did you-- [sniff] w-what did...
Ah-choo!
Gesundheit!
Ah-choo!
Ah-choo!
Hurry!
So where's that crystal, Donatello?
Somewhere really close to you.
Well, at least that narrows it down.
This'll give us a head start.
[growling]
Now you've made me angry!
Timber!
Wait!
That's the crystal, guys!
Grab it!
Easier said than done, Donatello.
Got it!
Hokum, Hokum, Hokum, hand over the crystal.
We have to take it back to Earth.
I don't know where Earth is, but you ain't leaving' here without me.
This hare's run that gol-dang turtle race for the last time.
Fine, great!
Let's go!
Fee fi fo fooey!
Give me back my shiny stone!
We've got to get down faster.
[Jack] Timber!
I think we've found your faster way down, Leonardo.
Donatello, we need that portal now!
Right, Raphael.
Quick, Michelangelo, switch the generator to Reserve Power.
You got it, amigo.
Whoa!
Whoa!
Whoa!
Next show at 4:00, folks.
We got the crystal?
Right here, fella.
Who's the rabbit dude?
You can explain later.
We've got to stop Shredder from docilizing the entire world.
Shred-head's going into the microwave transmission center!
I hope we're not too late.
One more adjustment, and I can begin broadcasting your Docilizer ray, Krang.
All right, dudes, it's wipeout time!
You're too late to stop the Docilizer ray, Turtles.
Guess again, Shred-head!
Oof!
What does this thing do?
No!
No!
No!
Our job here is done, thanks to that stupid rabbit.
Hey!
Watch who you're calling stupid.
Oh, no!
No!
Krang, the portal, hurry!
Guess we showed them, fellers.
Now I've got to put that siranium crystal in place to neutralize those Docilizer rays.
Oh, no, no, no, please.
Please don't hurt me.
I'm really very nice once you get to know me.
I really hate those Turtles.
Whoever placed this rare crystal on the tower is responsible for saving the city, and this reporter says we owe them a big vote of thanks.
This is April O'Neil signing off.
Well, Hokum, now what are you gonna do?
It's okay, fellas.
I've got a job for him.
[children shouting]
The Easter egg hunt is a real success.
Those Easter eggs you decorated are the hit of the day, guys.
I wouldn't say that.
Take a look.
You know, I ain't real fond of turtles, but you fellas sort of changed my mind, and as soon as I've finished being the Easter Bunny,
I'll be ready to return to the fairy tale dimension.
Hey, dudes, I've got a tubuloso idea!
Let's all go to the fairy tale dimension.
Then we could take turns racing with Hokum!
Dudes, it was just an idea.

He says that I smiled at him, there in the woods...
-What if it is true?
-Why should it be true?
Why did he shoot?
They were already on their knees.
Did you ever talk about that?
No.
Were you afraid of Jari?
He once said that he was afraid of me.
And you believed it?
What if it is true?
Did you always sleep in the car?
The car was the only place where he felt safe, I think.
How did you meet?
It was a long time ago.
I don't really remember.
THE little thief
Hey!
Where're you goin'?
-Where're you goin'?
-Home.
-Get in!
-No. I'll take the bus.
The bus?
What's wrong with my wheels?
-Get in!
-No, I've got to go home.
Come on!
I'll buy you some coffee.
Come on!
-Do you live here?
-About a hundred yards away.
-What is this place?
-l'll tell you about it some time.
-Any calls?
-What y'been up to?
Screw it!
Come on in!
-Hello.
-Screw the old man.
-What d'ya think?
-lt's OK.
I designed it myself.
Do you like music, too?
'll Capitano.' ls that a band?
-Yeah, my band.
-Oh!
When were these pictures taken?
Um...3 years ago. 3 years!
-May I read it?
-Sure, read!
Are you on this photo?
There.
Move over.
'Grand larceny, driving without a license...'
Jari's list of offences isn't particularly impressive.
'Car theft, car theft, car theft, misappropriation of motor vehicles, unlicensed driving, drunken driving, burglary, car theft, drunken driving', and so forth.
To me, he seems like a rather untalented little thief.
What do you think?
He said that one day he would do something big.
'Possession of stolen goods, assaulting an officer, unlicensed driving...'
-Have you been in jail?
-Me?
How could you think so?
!
Here you are.
-Fuck, I'm not on it!
-Don't swear, Jari!
You're on it.
-HALF my face!
-lt can't be helped.
-l want my money back.
-That's impossible.
You ordered the photo yourself!
Jari, where are you off to?
I'll call the police!
Stop, Jari!
Stop the car!
Now I've got you, you little bastard!
is this what you were brought up for?
Think about it, kid!
THE DREAM
And then there was Copenhagen...
You were in exile there, too.
What were you actually doing there?
It says something here about an abortion...
We were just spending time there.
You weren't doing anything, in other words...
He liked it there because nobody there could hope for anything.
No.
Wonderful!
Well, you did not have to hope.
-"Har nogen set min shampoo?" -"Bla-bla-bla-shampoo!"
Has anyone seen my shampoo?
In my dream I was lying in a gigantic room, and there was a hammock.
I dreamt I was lying in the hammock and you were lying on my stomach.
And you were a little baby...
Y'know?
A tiny, little baby.
Look, Minna!
-Was I this little in your dream?
-What's this?
-l can't take any more.
-Cut it out!
Shit, you're always bitching!
-Fuck!
-Where're we going?
We just wander around, going nowhere!
From pillar to post!
Haven't we had fun here?
Now we'll go to Amsterdam!
-l can't take it.
-What the fuck do you want, then?
-l want to have a home.
-Don't start that again.
A home!
-We're going to have a baby, Jari.
-Huh?
What'd you say?
You're lying.
-l thought you understood.
-Fucking hell!
Who the fuck told you to get knocked up?
No way, no day!
Get it?
I don't want any goddam kids hanging around.
-But you said you loved me.
-l love you.
And if you love me, you'll do as I say!
I'm the captain.
You're my soldier!
Children, this is the Eskimo's special talisman, a tupilak.
The Eskimo uses his tupilak if he wants to hurt someone.
He sends out the tupilak to kill the enemy.
Eskimos thought they could charm life into the tupilak, too.
It meant life or death to them.
Here is a real tupilak, that was brought here from Greenland.
I'll send it round.
Look at it carefully.
If you had a little tupilak, you would be safe from the big tupilak, whose power was useless against it.
Jari, give it back.
Here is an Eskimo family, safe in their igloo.
The evil tupilak tries to bore its way in through the ice, to the family
On your knees, you little shit!
You better not tell that I took it!
On your knees!
Beg for mercy!
-Beg for mercy!
-Mercy!
Mercy...
Head down!
You little shit!
separation
Minna!
What the hell's with you?
It's a long time since you wrote.
Too long.
I told you not to mess with me, you dumb bitch!
Don't you have any morals?
I have made all my decisions in our best interest, and you don't even care enough to visit me.
This makes me believe I've made a mistake about you.
You should learn that I seldom make mistakes.
That's why everyone here fears me.
They know I always do what the situation demands.
That's why I always win.
You must also learn that work is not the meaning of life, that you can never live on hope.
Remember how happy we were?
Like the last time in Copenhagen...
Remember?
You sure as hell don't want to wreck what we built up together, do you?
There's so much of you in it, too.
I love you and trust you, that's why I have a job for you.
It's easy, just do as I say.
A. Pull yourself together, and obey!
B. Do what I told you earlier.
C. Come here!
And don't fuck up!
You know what'll happen otherwise.
Just do as I say, and everything will be cool.
Miss you.
Love you.
Jari.
Why the hell didn't you write?
is it too much to ask?
I've tried. I can't.
Something's wrong with me.
I'm tired all the time.
-lt's some kind of depression.
-Horseshit!
Don't you understand why I write to you?
And how important it is for me to get an answer?
Don't you see how important...
There's no point in explaining it to you.
What's important is what happens after this. I've planned everything.
I quarrelled with my landlord last week,
but the flat's awfully nice.
It even has a balcony.
I know you're not living alone.
I'll talk about that later.
The flat is the first thing I ever owned.
-My own flat.
-Did you get the necklace through?
The metal detector missed it.
-lt's the one I bought in Copenhagen?
-Yeah.
You seem strange...
When I get out, we'll start all over.
A whole new life!
We'll cut out the small-time stuff, do something big.
Understand?
I've planned it.
Everything.
Fuck him!
He was here when I was born.
He'll be here when I'm dead.
But I won't die here.
When I get out, everything'll be different.
We'll do all the things we talked about in Copenhagen.
Sound good to you?
-C'mon, smile?
-Sure.
Stay cool!
Hi, Jari!
It was fun seeing you again.
You were the same as always.
I was so nervous, I couldn't say what I wanted to say.
The new flat is just great. I don't have to feel like I'm in the way.
I bought a kettle yesterday and the welfare lady was pleased with me.
She said I've begun to think independently.
I have changed.
You noticed, didn't you?
Oh, shit!
Some day, I've got to start thinking what I want to do with my life.
I've almost always had fun with you.
You're really the most unbelievable person I've met.
But I'm frightened.
I have nightmares every night, I dream of ending up in jail.
I hope you believe me when I say that I have always loved you, and never betrayed you.
We were really happy, sometimes.
But now it feels as if I must begin making my own decisions.
You mustn't be angry.
But when you come out, we can't be together anymore.
I need time to think about what I want to do.
Don't be angry with me.
In some way, I still love you.
Minna.
Ahoy, you over there!
is it you or the food that smells so good?
-What're you doing?
-Frying a steak for you.
-My sweet baby's frying me a steak!
-Lay off!
What's with you?
You ought to know.
Did you get bars for the windows?
If he climbs in through the balcony, all I've got is you to depend on.
What the hell do you see in him?
He plays with you like a toy...
You do exactly as he says.
And every day that passes, you loathe me more and more.
You're afraid of him!
Who is it?
Who's there?
-Pack your things.
-Now?
-Where are we going?
-To Amsterdam.
What do you mean?
THE JOURNEY
Don't look at them!
-Where are we actually going?
-You tanked the wrong gas!
You never do as I say!
I did exactly as you said.
Thanks to you, we've gotta change cars!
Where are we going?
Only assholes know where they're going.
Red, we go left.
Black, we go right.
Fucking shit!
You've got a problem.
You try to be like your goddam mother.
Sitting and listening to some fucking opera.
Fucking snobs.
And YOU?
Riding around this fucking country, nowhere near Amsterdam!
-Letting those fucking cards decide!
-l make the decisions!
-What do you really want?
-'What do you really want?
'
Go home and get some dude who'll put a ring on your finger!
Shut up!
Do you know how much I've counted on you?
You're the only broad I've kept this long.
You should be grateful!
is there anything you're missing?
Huh?
HUH?
Red.
We'll run away and never come back.
THE grain OF SAND
Ahoy, you over there!
Have you ever thought about eternity?
Have you ever tried to?
It's terribly hard to understand, no matter how hard you try.
In school once, we read a story about eternity.
There was a mountain in the ocean.
It was 1 ,000 kilometres wide, and 1 ,000 kilometres high, and 1 ,000 kilometres long.
One day there came...
And every thousand years, there came a bird, and cut his mouth on the mountain.
Sharpened his beak, you mean.
And when the mountain was all gone,
then one second of eternity had passed.
You open this, stick the cartridges in here, lock the bolt, cock the triggers, and shoot.
Hey, what're you doing?
You crazy bastard!
Here's one cashier.
Here's another.
Here's the bank manager.
Hold the gun right.
Then shout: 'On your knees!
'
-On your knees!
-Good!
Then I move here...
Then this dude turns up...
Goddammit, don't ever do that!
Hold the gun like this!
Turn your head, not the shotgun!
Anybody there?
Anybody there?
THE DECK OF CARDS
Let's drive there and eat something.
I'm starved.
Party time!
The 1 5-year-old who was murdered, had decided, before he died, to begin keeping a diary.
His first entry reads.:
'Today I made a clay frog.
I'm going to a dance on Saturday.'
When you were at the dance...
Did you see him?
There were so many people there.
I can't take any more.
I want to go home.
You're just like your goddam mother!
Where are we going?
-You choose.
-Why?
-We'll be happy, like in Copenhagen!
-Sure, sure!
G'night!
-l really got scared.
-Good!
I'm sick of this.
-What do you want to do?
-Go back.
Back?
Hey, Jari!
OK, let's take this one.
-Somebody saw us!
-Huh?
Somebody saw us!
-Don't you hear me?
Someone saw us!
-Jump on!
Hey!
They're following us!
Run to the car!
Wait!
Give me the gun!
Do as I say!
Load it and give it to me!
-Load the gun and come here!
-What?
Don't you hear?
!
You old bitch, let go!
Stomp on the fingers!
Minna!
THE rabbits
The rabbits!
Stop!
You're fucking crazy!
Do something!
Help me!
Bring water!
The bodies are lying at the edge of the graveyard's southern part.
The gravel path here has fresh footprints on it.
The man is lying flat on his back, half his skull is shattered.
The boy is lying...
let me see, now...
The left half of the boy's head is shattered, parts of his brain are on the ground nearby.
Buckshot can be observed in the brain matter.
There is vomit in front of the boy's head, about 30 cm. in front of the body, which may indicate that the father was killed first, causing the boy to become nauseated.
Hi, want a lift?
Yeah, to Amsterdam.
All the young people go there nowadays.
It is a nice place.
I like it very much.
How can you afford it?
Where do you get the money?
We work almost the whole year, then we travel, around, around...
-lt is great fun, this life.
-l can see that.
First, make much money, then...
Two Finns, a man and a woman in their 20's, are being sought by police as suspects in Sunday's triple murder in northern Sweden.
At a press conference held by the police, the suspects were described as extremely dangerous.
The couple is believed to be driving a black Volvo, licence no GZK 924.
I repeat GZK 924.
Police do not rule out that the pair may be bound for Norway.
What a horrible story!
What awful people!
-What a nice dog you have.
-lt seems as if you like animals.
-Yeah, I like animals very much.
-She likes you, I see.
-All animals like me.
-lt seems so.
I even think like a dog.
I'm an animal myself, you know, running in the woods.
-You enjoy that?
-Yes.
So long!
-Did anyone recognize you?
-No.
Where'd they get the pictures from?
Where d'you think?
Why d'you send them all over the place?
What does it say about us?
Well?
It says the boy was just 1 5.
Fifteen?
He said thirteen to me.
'Don't shoot me. I'm only 1 3.'
Listen!
They called your mother, and she said that you're not that kind.
When you were little, you were...
-What's 'svartsjuk'?
-Jealous.
You were jealous.
When you didn't think you were getting enough attention from her,
you'd knock her down and beat her with a cane.
THE ESCAPE
If you're thinking of leaving, remember what I did to that old bitch.
Understand?
No shit!
Get us a car!
Why did you shoot them?
It's so stupid, stealing a bike and killing three people for it.
Shut up!
Whose idea was it to take the bike?
Who said we should drive to just that town?
Did you want to end up in jail, asshole?
'll capitano!
' ls that who you are supposed to be?
You can't even start up an outboard!
Where will you go now?
-l didn't shoot anybody.
-What?
You smiled at me in the woods, when I was sitting on the old bitch.
-What're you getting at?
-l'm finally beginning to see.
-See what?
-You always smiled at me.
You're the captain, I do as you say.
It was you who made me kill them.
Do you know what that means?
It means that YOU killed them.
I've always been forced to be afraid of you.
You made all the decisions.
I've always been afraid of you.
Always.
On platform two, train from Copenhagen, arrival at 9.:30 a.m.
Come on out!
Just look at the camera.
reconstruction
Why, actually, did he shoot?
They were already on their knees.
Did you ever talk about that?
No.
The pastor is here to see you.
I have some clothes for you.
-We'll leave the door open.
-Thanks.
Hi.
My name is Monica.
How are you, Minna?
Does it trouble you that Jari says you did it?
Come along, here!
-Hi.
-Hi.
You probably understand why we're here.
We're going to reconstruct the whole episode.
Those cardboard boxes represent gravestones, and we... lt'll look just as it actually did.
The victims are outlined.
Now you'll be the leading man and the director, you seem to have certain qualifications for it, and I'll present an old acquaintance to you.
-One you surely recognize.
-Yeah.
-Do you care to...
-l must think a little, first.
Yes, that's a good idea.
She holds the weapon like this, like I taught her, and then she cocks the trigger.
Then when the man stands on this side, I mean this side, then suddenly...
Minna runs over here, cocks the trigger and screams:'Mahan!
'
That means 'On your knees!
' l am translating for them.
Did they say anything?
Yeah.
The man says:
'We just want our bike back.'
We just want our bike back.
And I say, even though I am standing there:
'Take the bike!
Go to hell!
'
And then...
Then the young boy says:
'Don't shoot me. I'm only 1 3.'
-Now you say.
-Don't shoot me. I'm only 1 3.
But he was 1 5.
Then I come and I take the gun, and say: 'What the hell do you do?
'
And she says: 'What is done is done.'
Minna!
This, then, is the wound described in...item 1 8.
The base of the skull is shattered inward, which means that there was tremendous force against the head and the temple here, and the blow came from behind.
Almost directly behind.
These slashes on the torso indicate that they were inflicted when the woman...when the woman was already dying of blood-loss, or was already dead.
What are you thinking of, Minna?
It took such a long time to reach them.
But she was already dead.
There was nothing you could do.
is that why you feel guilty?
He says that I smiled at him there, in the woods.
-What if it is true?
-Why should it be true?
Because then I thought that...
Now I am the captain, and he is the soldier.
is that all?
There is nothing more.
On the morning of July 3rd, 1 988, in a churchyard in a village in northern Sweden, three innocent people, a man, his wife and their 1 5-year-old son, were murdered.
Hence this film.
I know the art of evoking happy moments!
Those scents, those unending kisses, will they be born again from that unfathomable abyss, like a rejuvenated sun rises in the heaven from the depths of the sea?
O scents, O unending kisses!
The night was growing dense like a wall and my eyes glimpsed yours in the dark.
And I drank your breath
- O sweetness, O poison - and your feet fell asleep in my brotherly hands.
The night was growing dense like a wall. "
Is it over?
No, it's not.
Come, Jacquot, it's the end.
Sometimes it starts again.
No, it doesn't.
Let's go.
Papa's waiting...
It's not finished...
I'm staying.
Show us yours, Jacquot.
What, now?
Don't you worry...
They do it later in the Army to measure and compare, so they know.
Know what?
Look out, someone's coming!
Put it back.
It's nothing to write home about.
You three again!
Hello boy, homework done?
That's right.
Is it done?
Not yet, Papa.
Do what your father says.
Hurry up, Madame Marilou... 5 litres exactly.
You're tops.
- Hurry!
Only one side is curled...
- I'm coming!
I'm on stage in an hour.
Papa didn't want it,
Mama neither.
Good little children
Obey their parents.
- That's in Act 2.
- Yes.
It's the donkey duet.
The curler is too hot.
Come down.
Stay away from that ladder.
Done your homework?
I left my bag in the garage.
- It's fixed?
- Yes.
It clunks when it's cold, but that's normal.
Thanks.
Hello, Demy Garage here...
I want to order a new car.
A black Citroën 7 CV.
The customer's in a hurry.
Damn kids...
Always blocking the stairs.
Jacquot!
I hate being late.
I wanted an orange.
Goodnight, Papa.
You should've come with us.
I know "Les Saltimbanques"...
You know, the one Mama curls...
It is love that consoles the poor...
In bed, "the poor".
Say your prayers.
Our Father who art in Heaven...
They are good boys.
Hail Mary full of grace...
Coming to give us a kiss, Mama?
A rich labourer, knowing his death was imminent, called his children in... and addressed them without witness.
Be sure not to sell what is ours, he said.
There is a treasure hidden within.
Jacques' childhood was his treasure and a source of inspiration for his films.
Now then... let me write.
He was writing about his memories and he talked about them a lot.
Anecdotes came back, forgotten names and suddenly remembered details.
He spoke of the little kitchen, the focus of family life.
And above all of his mother, who was the life and soul of it.
Do you remember our last date?
He liked remembering Sunday outings, when time passed slowly.
He had known what he called "a happy childhood".
Jacques recalled the arrival of a country cousin that a Brazilian industrialist had turned into an upmarket tart.
Wait here.
Hey, good-Iooking, is this Raymond's garage?
Raymond's my father.
What do you want?
You don't know me, but I'm your aunt from Rio.
Papa!
Someone to see you, Boss.
That's him.
Oh, it's you.
You look terrific.
Come and meet the wife.
It's that cousin I told you about, who went off to Brazil.
Don't touch, it's organza.
At last I know the whole family.
I'll take you all to La Cigale tonight.
Come here, you.
You're invited too.
Now I can kiss you...
Oops!
It's my lipstick.
Shall I sing you a song?
For God's sake, don't get up.
Go on, sing Papa.
You didn't miss our local wine?
Yes, I often think of "Gros Plant".
One day a producer said I ought to be in the movies.
So I did tests.
But "Gros Plan" means "Close-up"...
I thought he was offering white wine!
Let's drink to that!
Cheers!
Beautiful diamonds...
Yes.
So extravagant...
I've been spoiled too.
You really shouldn't have...
Don't you criticise me...
No, I'm pleased with my present.
I adore casinos, particularly roulette...
I had a run of good luck.
I just kept on winning.
That means presents for everyone...
me too.
You came on your own?
I'm joining Bill Schuster in Munich.
He's the right sort.
First, I'd like to visit Grandpa's grave.
I wasn't here when he passed on.
I will wait for you night and day
until your return...
I'm the one who laughs...
Who wants to please...
I'm Lola.
That's my name.
We gave you your Grandpa's name, but for me you're my little Jacquot.
Seeing my name there when I was so young gave me a sense of the fragility of our existence.
Ah, how lucky I am!
I saw a little old lady and grabbed her handbag.
I'm as slippery as an eel.
- Guignol!
- He's stolen a bag!
I saw a policeman so I've hidden it.
Here he comes!
Good day, Guignol.
Good day, Gnafron.
Good day, Brigadier.
I say, you wouldn't have seen a suspicious individual?
A bag snatcher!
Did any of you children see him around here?
He hid it under a bush!
Are you doing that for Reine?
It still smells of coffee in here.
What are you, a tortoise?
None of your business.
Can I keep this box?
Take it if you like.
I want to make a puppet theatre.
What I hear about Munich's not good.
I wonder about that cousin from Rio.
Off to see her Mr Schuster...
Probably a spy.
Yet she seemed sweet and kind.
How could anything go well?
Why go at all?
And where?
Madame de Saint-Clair is here.
I feel like tapering it at the neck.
Mr Cavalet is home.
Will that do?
Almost...
I'll just give it one last comb...
You made a Negro policeman?
No, I didn't.
Why's he black then?
The potatoes go black.
I know...
I'll make the heads out of cardboard.
Come along, everyone!
Hurry up, please!
Next show in 15 minutes!
Snow White is pretty.
I liked the witch.
I knew you would.
Grumpy's always grumpy.
He didn't stop sneezing.
That was Sneezy, dopey!
You must see the film.
It's terrific and scary.
My father promised to take me if I get good marks.
I'm going again tomorrow.
Me too.
I'm going on Sunday.
Hello.
I've seen it too.
I like the witch best.
He's got a crush on Snow White.
Don't say that.
You said the other day she was for you.
I didn't, but she's not bad.
She always sings when she sweeps... when she washes up... and when she bakes cakes.
Mirror, mirror on the wall...
I met three lads from my hometown
I was kissed by the youngest
Who was also the handsomest
He took me to his room
To talk of our hometown...
A whole bowl
A whole bowl of milk
Nice and creamy
Nice and creamy, please
Some sifted sugar
And then you mix
You mix it well
Mama, they're outside!
Come see, there are giant dwarfs.
You've got them all, even Dopey.
A bit of chocolate?
Yes, please.
You're lucky to have them all.
Haven't you got Snow White?
No, I don't care two hoots about her.
She can't do the splits.
I can.
You try.
Go on, clumsy, try again.
Push downwards...
Stretch your legs...
We could work up an acrobatics act and tour the world in a circus.
If you like.
Keep trying.
Push!
Keep it rolling with your stick...
The Three Musketeers!
I've got my pay...
Pass me a spanner.
Let me treat you to a lakeside lunch...
Can you manage?
Caroline, Caroline!
Put your best shoes on...
It's war!
Mobilisation!
That's all what we needed!
God knows where I'll be sent.
You with your bad leg, you'll stay here.
Take those sacks to the cellars for a shelter.
We need some in the attics too.
If my two sons go off to war...
They'll test gas masks at school.
Reine will look like a fly.
Me, a fly?
You have a fly up your nose and Jacquot too.
You'd be a beautiful fly.
I've given him a big moustache.
Look, will that do you?
Oh, yes.
It fits.
She's the one with the hair.
- You don't hit puppets.
- Just a bit.
You think it's here?
- Demy, Raymond Marcel?
- That's me.
It's your posting.
The arsenal isn't very far.
I'll be home every night.
Better to make shells than be hit by them.
Do you think they're asleep?
Check.
They're fine.
- Makes a change from a beret.
- Good luck, neighbour.
Your lunch bag...
Grandma, can you make a cape for my puppet?
Not black like that, but with this shiny cloth?
Of course, Jacquot, but I must finish this.
Look at these pearls...
The woman's coming for it tomorrow.
Then you can do mine next.
Sing me another song.
I like your songs.
There was a king who remained faithful to his beloved and left her a golden goblet...
- Do you know about witches?
- Not really.
They fly on broomsticks.
Do they wear Japanese kimonos?
You know all about costumes.
There's Grandma and Jacquot!
Four for Cinderella.
Coming, my little ones, my elephants...
Coupons?
150 francs.
Fine.
In Germany they've requisitioned cars.
My husband wrote to hide ours.
I can't decide.
- Where is he?
- The Maginot Line.
Mine's busy making shells.
But he does get home every night.
What is it?
My guests haven't come.
Patience.
Go look.
Hang on, I've had an idea.
Ready, children and elephants?
Off we go.
Open the curtains.
And here is Cinderella.
I'm so unhappy...
My wicked sisters have gone to the ball and I'm cleaning up the cinders.
Poor girl.
Here I am.
I am the Fairy.
The Lilac Fairy.
Want to go to the ball?
Just watch.
Don't forget to leave at midnight.
First, I'll change your dress.
Here comes the stardust.
That's not stars, it's sand.
You're lice-ridden!
Look at the state of you!
Bend over the newspaper.
You know those Marchis kids are full of lice.
They clapped, Mama, and René and I bowed.
They're everywhere.
Let me see.
You can't.
They're too small.
I'll put some lotion on later.
- I've only got 1 left.
- I won these.
- You stole them.
- Don't argue.
Mind your own business, Demy.
- Give them back.
- No, I won them.
You're the cheat.
Don't argue.
We'd better go, or we'll be late.
See you later.
Look, Demy, a new poster!
"Silence.
Enemy ears are listening."
Are there enemies everywhere?
It's no joke...
Grandma and Mama read a book called Mr Spy and His Daughter.
The spies were disguised as nuns.
You had to check their shoes.
Hurry up, you lot!
Don't dawdle, Demy!
- This OK?
- Fine.
Mask on.
If there's a real alert, I want no dawdling and no fuss.
Nuns!
Let's go check!
Come with me to the toilet.
Can't you go on your own?
I'm frightened.
I'm going to explore the cave...
There's a glow in the distance...
Jacquot, come back!
It's as dark as Hell in there.
What's Hell?
I want to go to the fair.
It's for soldiers on leave.
Let's go to the Guignol.
We'll take a quick look first.
Hitler's head for 5 francs!
- Now we go to the Guignol!
- Now?
You're good, Father dear, but before I marry you,
I want the skin of that old donkey.
My banker donkey?
Never!
I insist, Father dear.
I can't possibly refuse you.
I say there!
Kill my donkey and bring me his skin.
They won't really kill it...
How dreadful!
It's disgusting.
Tell me, my fairy godmother, what shall I do?
Disguise yourself...
You have bizarre ideas.
Come on, hurry.
- Put this skin on.
- Awful!
Just do as I tell you.
From now on, we'll call you:
Donkey Skin.
Mama, there's no more school!
Due to the war.
Watch out.
Is the garage open?
Not really...
Maybe the mechanic can help.
Can I have some water?
Been on the road long?
We've driven from Bruges.
Come in for a moment.
We ran for it.
People said they were raping women and cutting off children's hands.
We left in a panic.
Too late, Madame Demy.
We're closing.
For good?
The Germans will soon be here.
They ransack.
They kill.
We're leaving.
All of you?
We're going back to the farm.
Are you off too?
I don't know.
Do you want to leave?
I don't know.
The Germans are coming.
Are we going or not?
Where to?
I can't leave Grandma.
Can you help us?
Lend us some civilian clothes.
Sorry, we're leaving...
Over here, boys!
Get some overalls.
We don't even know if we're still at war.
Catch.
Here.
Thanks, boy.
- Isn't Reine here?
- No.
She's staying with my sister.
No news of your husband?
I'm still waiting.
I worry, but I go to work.
I'll translate for you...
German's a weird language.
Hush!
Look at the poster...
You're taking them to the river?
Yes, I've got to pick up some mattresses.
They'll keep the girl company.
Don't let them swim on their own!
Don't you worry.
Off we go!
You get in here.
René, you climb in the back.
She's a refugee, from friends of friends.
She was a wonder from Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois and very pretty indeed.
No, not like that.
Like this.
What's your name?
Geneviève from Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois.
You have to move your arms more.
Shall we show her the stairs?
Then, there's a little staircase.
Coming?
You keep watch.
My turn.
The witch's door is open.
Maybe it was burglars.
Let's look inside.
Can I see?
Do you think she's dead?
It's him again.
The metallurgist.
It's him.
It's wonderful.
Hush, don't say a word.
Don't worry.
It'll be fun.
We won't be able to play cars.
Then play cars now.
Off we go!
We're going for a drive.
Along the banks of the Loire.
Careful.
I can't swim.
Put that down.
You mustn't touch everything.
They've got to have fun.
It's all new to them.
What's this for?
Pouring water on the grindstone to sharpen the tools.
If you're thirsty, drink.
I've brought their things.
Old George told me to take kids from Nantes.
He told me the clog-maker is a good man.
Looks like he was right.
They seem pale.
The fresh air will do them good.
We don't see the war here.
Except there's no tobacco.
- I'll give you money.
- Later.
We'd better go.
I've never left them.
Don't fret.
We'll look after them.
Come on.
Let's go feed the rabbits.
I want to feed the rabbits too.
- Bye, children.
- Bye.
You don't cut yourself on that knife?
I've been making clogs for 30 years.
Home we go, little fellow.
"My darlings,
"Here are some transfers
"...and a badge of the arms of Nantes,
"since you said you wanted a badge.
"Say hello to Aunt Léa
"and the clog-maker.
"Big kiss from Papa and Mama,
"Marilou."
Not bad, huh?
Your badge is great.
They don't have them in the country.
Where'd you get it?
Little Demy...
You've grown!
The country air has done you good.
Here's the washing.
Thank you.
Goodbye, Madame Le Dentec.
It's nice to have you back.
Jacquot, take your beret off at table.
I've made a real feast:
Pasta with cheese and sausage, from the sausage lady.
- Luce, who sings in church?
- Yes.
Glad to be home, boys?
Yes, Papa.
I want to go to the cinema and the circus.
I'll take you, or your father will.
All Papa likes is boules!
It feels good.
We're a family.
Back to catechism class.
First Communion in May.
Yes, Mama!
You're late...
Catechism went on for ever.
I know.
So I hope you pass your First Communion test.
- Your sister passed first time.
- He knows.
He knows his catechism.
At least, I hope so.
Can you help us fix up a trapeze?
I'd better ask your Papa, or you ask Guy.
This beam?
"Lift up your souls, yet remain modest", as our priest says.
- Missed!
- Your turn!
You will do it, Robert?
Yes, later.
Look at Reine's shutters.
Is she not back?
We don't see much of her.
She's taken on airs.
Feldkommandant Holt was shot in the back.
There's a curfew at 4 p.m.
There'll be reprisals.
It happened on Rue du Roi Albert.
- On your way to catechism...
- Yes, that's it.
"Cowardly criminals working for England and Moscow...
"...shot the Nantes Feldkommandant in the back...
"on 20 October.
"The murderers have not been caught.
"To punish this crime
"I have ordered that 50 hostages be shot. "
"Due to the gravity of the crime, 50 more hostages..."
- 15 million for informers!
- More than Judas got.
50 innocent people shot.?
It's true.
My father said so.
The occupation:
A quiet war.
It's easy to lay down the law with guns.
We mustn't see German films.
I know.
My father told me.
It looks terrific though.
And it's in colour.
What a pity.
Prévert wrote it.
A sad love story.
Let's see it.
Three for Les Visiteurs du Soir.
Gluttony is a sin, my boy, but it is your First Communion.
Roast pork...
You've saved our bacon!
If you put it there it will get cooked.
No, I'm using petrol.
That'll fool them at the checkpoint.
- Thanks.
- See you tomorrow.
I'll come early to help your wife.
Radio Paris lies...
Radio Paris is German!
We'll take the tape off the windows.
We took the floor and the sugar to the baker's.
It's magnificent.
It's like before the war.
A real tiered cake.
It's been so long.
- I can't eat any more
- I can.
Don't eat, Luce, sing.
Sing us a song!
I laugh to see myself so lovely in the mirror!
Let's sing another.
"Little Lison".
It's going well.
She raises her bottom like her mother
And with her glass, she says "Bottoms up!"
You're as handsome as a prince!
What present did you get?
A gramophone.
Got any records?
Two.
I can lend you some.
Some water will do them good.
No water!
Water drinkers are nasty, as was proved by the Flood.
Listen to this, Guy.
Music?
Any time.
The clock goes tick-tock
The birds go cheep-cheep
The turkeys go gobble-gobble
And the bell goes ding-dong...
But when my heart goes boom
Everything else goes boom
As love wakes up.
I like ball bearings.
It's terrific.
You can see all the funnels.
You're lucky.
You can look again if you like.
Is it true you can see Le Normandie?
Yes.
Let me see.
- I'll swap you.
- For what?
Some ball bearings.
Two sets.
Yes.
Bye.
What you showed Le Gerrec was film?
Yes, movie film.
- Where'd you find it?
- What'll you give me?
- Ball bearings.
- No.
Two sets.
I want the pencil-sharpener.
Then give me the film and tell me where you found it.
- It's Le Normandie?
- Yes.
Watch out.
Gypsies are dangerous.
You mustn't go near them.
I don't care.
That's not why I came.
Mine's got a plane.
I think it's a Messerschmitt.
- I've got a tank.
- It's German newsreel.
We shouldn't have...
It must be forbidden.
Listen, we found it on a dump!
- We ought to take it back...
- Don't be silly.
These spoils of war, a few feet of real film, eagerly brought home by Jacquot, had no time to become a fetish and catalyze his passion.
Marilou swept them away as rubbish or as "compromising documents".
Jacquot had lost Le Normandie for nothing.
Hey, Aunt Nique!
Your stocking seam looks like a snake!
Since I am asked to justify myself,
Monsieur Pitou loves Mademoiselle Clairette and she loves him too.
Yes, I tell you.
It's for her that Monsieur is here.
It's cold.
Those Krauts are ugly.
Jean Marais is handsome.
4:15.
What are they waiting for?
They like making us wait.
They take their time.
Look: "Filming on a farm:
Jean Choux and his crew."
- Ducks too.
- Some crew!
Jean Gourget's new film, Malaria, will take place entirely in the tropics.
About time.
"I want Malaria to have an atmosphere of fear", he says.
"Mireille Balin plays a colonial wife suffering from malaria.
"Sessue Hayakawa plays a native boy, a guitar player.
"Love erupts between these two feverish beings."
- Mireille Balin's beautiful!
- Beautiful?
I know what I'm talking about.
That one doesn't look bad.
A guy falling from a tree.
There's blood everywhere!
He's sweet.
He blows up my tires.
Don't forget the valve.
You bike your mother around?
No.
She's a neighbour.
She's going for her coupons.
Now you can go.
I'm going out to get some biscottes.
I'm scared.
We've got a shelter.
- I want to go.
- We'll all go.
What a racket.
It's Hell.
I'm frightened.
I feel sick.
It'll soon be over.
Look how calm Jacquot is.
Remember the cave where it was as dark as Hell?
I'm frightened.
On September 16th, 1943
I discovered the full horror of violence and destruction.
There were dead all over town, people screaming, and dying beneath the rubble.
It was the Apocalypse.
Ever since
I've hated violence.
My city kids...
I knew we'd see you.
We thought we'd just turn up.
There's no electricity.
It's all broken down.
A total disaster.
It was dreadful.
We heard it here.
Come see the rabbits.
Remember the white one?
Of course.
It was all craters and smoke...
people looking for each other...
I was in the street too.
People were trapped.
I heard them shouting.
- On your own?
- I was looking for Papa.
I was fixing a car on the Avenue des Américains.
I got under it just in time.
The Americans?
You brought them.
Don't be stupid.
It's hard to figure out:
Our allies bombing Nantes.
Destroying Nantes, you mean.
Filthy Germans!
It's all their fault.
We're no trouble?
None at all.
We'll all squeeze in.
I won't be here long.
I'll go back to the garage as soon as we get the electricity back.
He always has his gramophone.
Hello, hello, James.
What's new?
Since my fortnight away?
I'm calling you to discover
What I'll find on my return...
All is well, Madame la Marquise.
All is very well.
But we must tell you that there's been a slight problem...
Come on.
Inside.
Come to bed, Jacquot.
I'm sleepy.
Go to sleep on your own.
Under the covers, boy.
Are your feet all right now?
Yes.
You'll get used to them.
Finishing your clog today?
No, not that chisel.
Here.
I'm teaching you a trade, but you'll never take it up.
You'll have better to do.
I'm going to make sets.
Sets?
Theatre and cinema sets, and puppet shows.
Don't walk over the bridge at Mauves!
Missed!
After you,
I'll never love again...
After you, my heart will be broken for ever...
Enough reading.
Home we go.
We'll swap over.
The past participle agrees with gender and plural of the complement when it is placed before.
For example:
La bille qu'il a prise est bleue.
What did he take?
La bille.
Listen to me, boys.
Things are getting hot up there.
Bille is feminine and before the verb so the colour is feminine too.
Don't be scared.
Every time I hesitate over a past participle agreeing,
I recall the school classroom at Mauves and that parachute floating down over the Loire.
A late visitor.
Come in.
"Un Visiteur du Soir".
Here's our neighbour.
The Germans raided the café to get young men for forced labour.
They took Gaston and Paul.
The others had made themselves scarce.
Damned Germans!
And Gilles too.
Gilles and Dominique, Dominique and Gilles...
No, they didn't take Dominique.
It's from Les Visiteurs du Soir.
Films...
That's all he thinks about.
You ought to go see the old Gallon sisters, the teachers.
They had a projector and some Chaplin films.
Some shorts.
Good idea.
The boy's bored stiff.
You'll be careful?
Regularly and gently.
Not too gently, fairly gently.
Here are the films.
You'll bring it back, won't you?
This country lettuce...
It's delicious.
We eat it every day.
- Pleased to see your parents?
- Yes.
Papa gave me a present.
Presents always work.
- What do we do?
- Keep still.
Your bicycle!
Be quiet.
Come in, it's all ready.
Look, Mama, the projector.
Don't touch.
I'm the projectionist.
Look at the screen, Papa.
Sit down.
I've seen it.
It doesn't work.
Be patient.
It will.
What is it?
Soap?
It's bubble soup!
Jacquot was as delighted as if he'd made the film himself.
Happily showing films, he ended his days at the clog-maker's.
The Loire had become dangerous, with Americans on one bank,
Germans and the Resistance on the other.
It was time to go home, back to the sand, the long porch, and the garage courtyard.
When we sing at cherry blossom time, the nightingale and the mockingbirds all have a wonderful time...
But it doesn't last for ever, cherry blossom time, when some people go to gather earrings in a dream...
The Americans are here!
White wine, Raymond!
Coming?
It's Chopin.
I recognise it.
I like it here.
Poor Chopin, all jazzed up.
It sounds fine.
But it's written for the piano.
Thanks, I'll take it.
O.K.
I've been through this before, except the other was lent and this is a gift.
Don't thank me.
It's worthless.
Papa will buy an electric one.
When you're fed up, you can give it to me.
I'm your junk cousin.
Don't be silly!
Bye, old man.
Where am I going to put all my things?
You need room for a cinema.
You're not fair.
I need cardboard boxes, glue and fairy lights.
Will you give me money?
This Chaplin is funny.
It's for you.
I've seen it forwards and backwards.
Look at the screen:
Pillars just like at the Olympic.
He did it all himself except for the curtain.
Come have some coffee.
Let him put it away.
I've only got one film.
If only I could rub it out and change it.
Don't ask me.
You ought to buy me more.
It's not the time.
Will you fix my hairdo?
I don't do hair any more.
What with the boys and the garage...
I even do the book-keeping, look.
Let's see your hair...
What are you up to?
I've had an idea how to make a new film.
The saucepan will poison us.
Promise Mama you'll rinse it well.
- I can't wait to see Part Two.
- Me neither.
I like her saying, "a glimmer like everyone;"
and talking about her mother, who was a laundress.
It's a fine love story.
It's a masterpiece.
You can't see.
You'll ruin your eyes.
"The bridge at Mauves."
You can see the crossbars.
It was hard to draw.
It's so tiny.
Mama, it's serious.
It's a cartoon newsreel.
It's very good.
"The planes are flying away."
Did you like it?
It was very good.
Look, bras!
- Straight to the ladies' underwear!
- Just looking.
Research.
The clean minds of today's youth...
You make your own way home, Jacquot.
Come see.
Women go into that shop and then they disappear.
Who told you?
Someone.
I just heard.
- Those two?
- Hard to tell.
- It's a fairy tale.
- No, a drama.
They're sold as slaves to harems in Argentina.
Look, sheet music.
Aunt Nique has the same.
- What's what?
- Old junk...
- Let's go.
- No.
This shop's amazing.
Something in particular?
No.
Yes...
What's that camera with the handle in the window?
A movie camera.
For real films?
9.5 mm.
For amateurs.
Does it work?
If you put film in.
I need it.
I want to be an amateur.
But I haven't any money.
Have you nothing to swap?
Books or games?
Why are you rushing about?
- He's got ants in his pants!
- He'll get over it.
All right, Mr Dubuisson?
We fill the tank.
We have a chat.
I was looking for you...
I didn't want you to go knowing you were angry...
So I got the camera, but I had no idea how to use it.
Luckily, there was an instruction book.
I was in a hurry to learn all those barbaric terms like f-stop, orthochromatic film, panchromatic vision filter, film stock...
As soon as I'd read it, I decided I wanted to make the script used as an example:
"Solange's Adventure".
There you are.
I've learned lots of words:
Emulsion speed, f-stop, shutter, ortho, panchro, depth of field.
Good for you.
But it's all Chinese to me.
What is it?
Is that what you learn at school?
"'Solange's Adventure'.
Actors:
Solange (5), her parents, a prowler. "
Off we go.
"Despite being forbidden to, Solange plays in the street.
'A prowler promises her sweets and kidnaps her. "
Hey, I'm making a film.
I need a big chap for the gypsy.
Can you come Thursday to the garage?
On Quai des Tanneurs?
I know.
I'll come.
- I'll be home late.
- Don't worry.
It'll be open.
"A gipsy makes her dance at fairs,
"but her mother recognises her thanks to a locket.
"This film for all the family will have more appeal than a reel
"of some young star pointlessly posing..."
- You learn this at school?
- Yvon asked me that.
That's my fur.
- Will you lend it to me?
- What for?
For Yvon.
He's playing Solange's mother.
René's little brother is Solange.
- What's all this?
- Watch your cocoa!
- I don't like being a girl.
- I wouldn't mind!
We need a dress, make-up, and a hat.
I'll go to Madame Bredin's.
- I've got it ready.
- Thanks.
It's an old dress of Reine's.
This circus of yours is causing havoc.
Stop making faces.
You look pretty, Yvon.
Come out.
Yvon, explain to Solange she mustn't go out alone.
Now, walk slowly toward me.
Good.
That'll do.
Here, Lorca, I'll show you where to go.
You hide here.
René...
We'll do a full-face shot of him.
Solange, you play with your ball.
Drop it... and turn right.
You're the kidnapper!
Look.
"Soon after a character offers her sweets,
"then wraps her in his cape."
So you stride after her and offer her sweets.
- Do you like sweets, pretty girl?
- Yes, sir.
Then you'll get some!
Go on.
Fight back!
"Six months later." Want to be older?
No, it's for my film.
Today, there's good news:
Germany has surrendered.
Belly-dancing means moving your belly without moving your feet.
You try.
Move your head too.
Now we'll do it with the others.
I'll place you with your drum.
You, dance.
You, beat time on the drum.
We'll shoot.
Get on with it.
Bang harder, Lorca.
Then, the mother arrives.
Now, listen!
We move back.
You come forward.
When you see her dancing, you say, "Hey!"
Not now.
Move back!
When we shoot.
Recognise your daughter.
But that's Solange's locket!
Mama!
What are you doing?
I'm wrapping up my first takes to send them to the Pathé Lab at Joinville-le-Pont.
Nothing for me?
Not today, my boy.
In the Far West, when night falls
Cowboys gather round the fire
And sing an old song
About beautiful Texas...
It's going to be a fine cardigan.
Knitting takes so long.
Patience.
I'm the patient one.
I've been waiting two months.
The labs reopen, but I still wait and wait.
It's no joke.
I'm fed up.
And you only knit for Papa!
Then one fine day the film arrived.
What excitement.
I loaded it on to my projector.
Not a thing.
It was absolutely, totally transparent.
I had forgotten to adjust the f-stop.
It was clear I had to learn the technique.
What's wrong?
I want to go to film school.
We'll ask your father.
I know what he'll say:
"Are you crazy?
Thinking about films at your age!"
Learn a trade in a technical school.
You'll be a mechanic.
I want to go to high school.
Whoopee, veal with prunes!
I want to graduate.
Tech gives you a trade.
High school, nothing.
Set your minds to it for once.
Go on.
Turn it.
If he picks on me again, I'm off.
- Where to?
- Who cares?
Africa, to teach mechanics to the Negroes.
That's it.
You clear off to Timbuktu!
Me, I'd head for Paris.
I'll load crates or be an extra at the Opera.
They'll take anyone.
One of my mother's clients told me.
You don't have to sing, just hammer it out at the back.
I'll be all right at the Opera then!
I won't spend my life teaching dance
I'll go to Paris, take a chance
Why teach pliés and entrechats
When I want to dance at the Opera?
We are a pair of twins
Born in the sign of Gemini...
I absolutely must go to Paris.
I'm going too, but later.
Papa says I must finish tech.
Meanwhile, I make films.
With that?
As it happens,
I've had an idea for a film and you'd be terrific in it.
Are you kidding?
You and your camera are too small.
I've got big projects.
Remember my aunt from Rio, how flirtatious she was?
She batted her eyelashes.
She was fun.
- It's a great role.
- Wasn't she the casino gambler?
Yes, that's her.
With a scene where you'd win lots of money.
Don't you want to?
Back to your dreams, young Jacquot.
I've got my own.
How's it going?
I give up on actresses.
It's better to make cartoons.
The stars are cardboard in cardboard sets.
I see.
You want some cardboard?
- Can I have some?
- Of course you can.
Thanks, Mr Sweets.
Am I Mr Sweets for ever?
Can I come back for more?
Whenever you like, boy.
The boy had a project and he needed space.
The attic next to the tires was ideal and he made it his own.
A new life of peace and quiet began, far from the noise of the tech, a trifle less from that of the garage.
What are you making?
- A ballerina.
- What's that?
A girl who dances.
Look at her with that blonde wig.
Who?
Viviane Romance.
She was in Carmen.
We saw that.
It was good.
- Nice costumes...
- Yes.
It's a film by Marcel L'Herbier, so you know it's good.
Show me.
Otherwise I don't get it.
Come on then, I'll explain.
Look.
You have a nice setup.
Don't touch.
It's fragile.
Not by the camera...
It's exactly in place.
If I want the little dancer to move,
I move her leg and shoot a frame.
Got it?
It's continuous movement.
If you film an arm you get continuous movement.
Now you can climb down.
I need all my concentration.
It's no damn good!
It's blurred, out of focus.
No good at all.
I've got patience.
If I had a new camera I'd begin again.
It's nice being here with you.
I've been twice and talked to him.
He says it's a bargain.
It's that one.
It's more stable.
Automatic is better than cranking the handle.
If you say so.
Shall we go in?
It's your present.
I'm glad I have you.
This camera, an Ercsam Camex, was the one I used.
It shot frame by frame.
Car headlamps are not the right thing for lighting sets.
We're a bit short.
People are paying late.
Your chum, Mr Debuisson owes me 2 months.
He's talking to Mama.
Hello, Mr Debuisson!
How's the tech?
My marks are O.K., but it's so dull.
Not again...
For an artist, it's hard not getting your own way.
- You should see the attic.
- You've never seen it!
I can't stand heights!
- Can I see?
- Of course.
The cartoon was terrific.
That's what I want to do.
I need equipment.
Christ on a bike!
Every Sunday the same thing:
"I don't want to be a mechanic.
I want to study film making."
We got him a camera.
Now he wants lights, a tripod...
God knows what else!
- Calm down, Raymond.
- I wish he would!
You're tough on Jacquot.
He works hard.
Let him have fun.
A foreign girl arrived in Paris
Having crossed the globe
She settled in our fine country
But she had left something behind in Chile
She had left something behind...
And I forgot to buy a Madeira cake.
I'm not a baby.
Cake won't work.
Sweet things never hurt grouches.
You've been sitting there for an hour fuming with rage.
You know why?
Papa drives me mad.
Don't say that.
It's a sin.
So is sulking.
Laugh, you clown.
Even if you're sad!
Ask your Papa to tell you what happened when he came to Nantes from the country...
His "room in town"
in a drunk's house, a Colonel's widow.
Thank you, Guilbaud.
Have a drink with me.
I'm sure it'll cheer you up.
You've drunk enough tonight.
No?
Too bad for you.
You're already drunk as a skunk.
The way you speak amuses me.
As drunk as a skunk, indeed!
I'll just drink to your health.
And now the show begins...
Turn it on, Yvon.
His father agreed to cut the door in half.
Why?
Projector noise.
The smallest cinema in the world.
I'm flattered to be invited.
You're our son's main supplier.
My supplier and friend.
Turn the light off, Yvon.
Open the curtains.
Screen!
Music!
Lights, Yvon.
Short, but very sweet!
Sailors are fun.
Mountain-climbing's great.
The mountain can wait.
You must see Beauty and the Beast.
- Think so?
- You bet.
If you do, I'll go again with you.
You accept me if I draw, but you never let me in your attic.
That's normal.
Demy, come tell us what to see.
He always knows.
We must see...
Duvivier's Untel Père et Fils.
It's good.
I've seen Caprice with Danièle Darrieux.
We know what you think of her.
Let's see.
Edith Piaf.
I adore her.
She sings really well.
I'm making a film in my attic.
A bag snatcher escaping over the roofs of Paris.
It's called "Attaque Nocturne".
I'll be tied up for months.
Four seasons had passed, or a number, anyway...
Between fitting and welding,
Jacquot's French teacher introduced him to classical music.
He bought a copy of this record, but remained faithful to the waltzes which suited 'Attaque Nocturne".
Jacquot had grown.
He had changed.
When he came down for meals, he didn't say much, which worried his mother.
All right, Yvon, Jacquot's here.
When his father came up for a new tire, he never looked at the cardboard city his son lived in.
Yvon had become a sportsman.
Jacquot visited his grandmother and went to the cinema a lot... or walked towards the port.
He was pulling at his moorings.
Jacquot was becoming Jacques.
He still complained about the tech.
I hated that technical school.
Thumping my sheet metal felt like hitting my father, or letting off steam.
I had to get out of there, find a solution.
While I made a mortise and tenon,
I was thinking of Hollywood.
Where's this going?
Round the client's neck?
Start again.
Fitting a tire without the inner tube!
Hang on, I'll give you a hand.
It's not a champagne omelette.
What were you thinking of?
Hollywood, of course!
Some mechanic...
Rita has a terrific figure.
She was a G.I. Mascot.
They had her everywhere, even on that awful Hiroshima bomb.
- You believe that?
- Yes, Rita was the bombshell.
We'll screen this film.
You'll see.
It's ages since I saw it, it may be no good.
Let's take a look all the same.
- Can I switch it on?
- Wait...
This way, please.
I like the title:
"Le Port de I'Angoisse".
That's the French title.
Remember the scene where Bogart picks his passengers up.
Yes, that's "day for night".
It was shot in daylight.
- And the moonlight?
- There isn't any.
It's the sun's reflection through a red filter.
To shoot moonlight, you need sunshine as backlighting with, say, a reflection on water, a shiny surface of some kind.
You need to have a precise angle between the camera, the backlit characters and the sun.
How do you know?
I learnt it.
That dress is too tight.
At least they can see!
It's nothing to be proud of.
What do I say to people?
Who to?
Friends, neighbours?
It's none of their business.
You never tell me anything.
Make it up.
Say I'm getting married.
- A good idea.
- Then I'll go find me a husband.
- What a business.
- As you can see.
What are you going to do?
Me, nothing, but my mother wants me married.
Who with?
I don't know.
I don't know anyone who wants to and you're far too young.
Coming out?
I hate carnivals.
I'm going back upstairs.
Are you going?
I'm going with my chums to see Mr Obligi.
He films for the news.
- You say that, then go dancing.
- No, I don't.
Come back for my baby's christening!
I'll just take a look...
What's your name?
Josiane
How silly these people are!
I hate carnival time.
Don't be so bitter, darling.
Look how big you are.
You carry it in front.
It'll be a boy, or twins.
No, everything's fine.
I'm sick of operetta.
You see it all from one place.
At the movies, your eye moves.
You can see faces and details.
It's better.
Papa!
Papa, quick!
My drawing teacher...
Hang on.
I told you, remember?
The one who likes me.
Let me finish.
I asked him to drop by.
He's with Mama.
Come talk to him.
It's not very reasonable to think about the cinema.
He tinkers in the attic.
I've seen bits.
He's gifted.
No doubt, but the cinema is another world.
Many are called, few chosen.
I advise you to rid him of his illusions.
- Has he gone?
- He was in a hurry.
Coffee, Raymond?
- Didn't he say anything?
- Not really.
Do you want coffee, or cocoa?
Why did he come then?
Come inside.
There's no love, Hélène.
Only proof of love.
If life's mysteries add up to nothing
Don't think, don't think about it too much.
Why does the rain come from above?
Don't think, don't think about it too much.
Why does the moon have an influence
On the tides of the Seven Seas?
Why do peacocks go "Lee-oo" while cocks "Cockle-doo-doo"?
Don't think, don't think about it too much.
Everything O. K?
- Yes, fine.
- What's this setup?
Roller-skating on the set?
To do voluptuous crane shots,
I had fixed the camera on a roller skate.
I had a sort of sloping incline, all marked out in millimetres and centimetres.
I moved it down, shot a frame, moved it lower and shot another.
Then I had to move my little man.
You make him come down the steps and I'll move the camera down, frame by frame.
We're trying it out speeded up.
I should finish up in close-up on the thief hiding down the manhole.
It ought to work, except when it comes to it...
It required great patience, but I had always had that.
Coming...
You're always the first.
- We don't see each other much.
- I don't have time.
You have to finish your film...
It's slowed up since we've been going out.
You do look like Françoise Christophe.
I think you're very pretty.
It's good.
Last night was fun.
At last you're happy.
You're learning a trade.
You're doing well at tech.
You do your film.
You're calm.
Everything's fine.
I'm calm but I'm not happy.
You understand nothing!
I've no choice.
Look how calm I am!
Manual workers only receive a primary education, but know all about their trade.
Manual workers are generally strong with well-developed bodies.
Secondly, intellectual workers, bureaucrats for example, need exercise after work.
Intellectuals are not as strong as manual workers.
To conclude, the manual worker and the intellectual worker are totally different from each other.
Write it down.
MAN'S PRIDE IS WORK WELL DO NE
I feel as flat as my little men.
Now I've done my film, I'm at a loose end.
I was happy making it, sure of myself.
Now, there's only the tech, the final exam in 2 or 3 months and then...
I'm not even angry any more.
That's what's scary.
You're tired.
It'll pass.
What I've seen of your film is ace.
That's what you say.
Only you come up here.
Your "Bag Snatcher" is good.
It's not "Bag Snatcher".
It's "Nocturnal Attack".
I said I had to make films as I was sick to death of the garage.
He kindly told me I should go see Fernand Jean at the Apollo, to find out what he thought.
Remain confident.
I'll talk to Fernand Jean.
So I went to the Apollo cinema with my projector and showed the film from the Apollo's projection room to the manager who said,
"It's good.
You ought to be making films."
I told him my parents didn't agree...
Later, Christian-Jaque came to Nantes to present his film D'homme à hommes.
Where are you taking us?
To see D'homme à hommes.
You'll like it.
What's it about?
The chap who founded the Red Cross and Christian-Jaque will be there.
- We've seen several of his.
- He's made 40!
All right.
Let's go.
I'm going on my bike.
At the intermission,
Christian-Jaque was kind enough to look at my film.
He saw it and thought it wasn't bad.
"You ought to make films", he said.
And my father then said,
"Well, if you think the boy can do any good,
"then he'll go to Paris."
I left for Paris the following October.
First, I studied film-making and I was out of work, then a filmmaker.
I met a woman filmmaker, we made a few films, then she gave me a fine son and now I paint.
Devils and wonders, winds and tides, far away the sea has gone out.
And you, like a strand of seaweed gently caressed by the wind, you move as you dream in the sands of the bed.
Devils and wonders, winds and tides, far away the sea has gone out.
But in your half-open eyes two tiny waves are still there.
Devils and wonders, winds and tides, two tiny tears, two tiny waves to drown myself in.
Subtitling TITRA FILM Paris
I know the art of evoking happy moments.
Scents, unending kisses...
Will they be born again from that unfathomable abyss, like a rejuvenated sun rises in the heaven from the depths of the sea?
O scents, O unending kisses!
The night was growing dense like a wall.
My eyes met yours in the darkness.
And I drank your breath.
O sweetness, O poison!
And your feet fell asleep in my brotherly hands.
The night was growing dense like a wall.
- Is it over?
- It's not!
- Come, Jacquot, it's the end.
- Sometimes it starts again.
No, it doesn't.
Let's go.
Dad's waiting...
It's not finished...
I'm staying put.
DEMY'S CINEMA
Show us yours, Jacquot.
- What?
- Don't worry...
They do this in the army, to measure and compare, so they know.
Know what?
Someone's coming!
Put it back in, it's nothing to brag about.
You three again!
Have you done your homework?
Yes, is it done?
- Not yet, Dad.
- Do what your father says.
Hurry up, Mrs. Marilou!
Five liters exactly.
Swell.
- Hurry!
Only one side curled...
- I'm coming!
I'm on stage in an hour.
- That's in Act 2.
- Yes, it's the donkey duet.
The curler is too hot.
Come down.
Stay away from that ladder.
Done your homework?
I left my bag in the garage.
- It's OK now?
- Yes.
It clunks when it's cold, which is normal.
Demy Garage here.
I wanna order a new car.
A black Citroën 7 CV.
The customer can't wait.
Damn kids!
Always in the stairs...
Jacquot!
I hate being late.
I wanted an orange.
Good night, Dad.
You should've come too.
I know "Les Saltimbanques."
The woman Mom curls...
It is love That consoles the poor...
In bed, "the poor."
Say your prayers.
Our Father, who art in Heaven...
They're good boys.
Hail Mary, full of grace...
Coming to give us a kiss, Mom?
A rich laborer, knowing death was imminent, called his children in and addressed them without witness.
Be sure not to sell what is ours, he said.
There is a treasure hidden within.
Jacques's childhood was his treasure and a source of inspiration for his films.
Now...
Let me write.
He loved to write about his childhood memories.
Anecdotes flooded back, forgotten names and suddenly remembered details.
He spoke of the little kitchen, the focus of family life.
And above all of his mother, who was the life and soul of it.
Do you remember our last date?
He liked remembering Sunday outings, when time passed slowly.
He had experienced what he called "a happy childhood."
Jacques recalled the arrival of a country cousin that a Brazilian industrialist had turned into an upscale tart.
Wait here.
Hey, cutie, is this Raymond's garage?
Raymond's my father.
What is it?
You don't know me, but I'm your aunt from Rio.
Someone to see you, boss.
- There he is.
- It's you!
You look great.
Come and meet the wife.
The cousin I told you about who headed to Brazil.
- Don't touch, it's organza.
- Now I know the whole family.
I'll take you all to La Cigale tonight.
Come here, you.
You're invited too.
Now we can kiss.
Oops!
It's my lipstick.
Shall I sing you a song?
- For God's sake, don't get up.
- Go on, Dad.
Sing!
Didn't you miss our local wine?
Yes, I often think of "Gros Plant."
One day a producer said I ought to be in the movies.
So I did tests.
But "Gros Plan" means "Close-up"!
I thought he was offering white wine!
Let's drink to that!
Cheers!
- Amazing diamonds.
- You shouldn't have.
I've been spoiled too.
You really shouldn't have...
Now don't you criticize me!
No, I'm pleased with my gift.
I adore casinos, particularly roulette...
I had a run of good luck.
I simply kept on winning.
That's when I buy presents for everyone, including me.
You came on your own?
I'm joining Bill Schuster in Munich.
He's an honest man.
First, I'd like to visit Grandpa's grave.
I wasn't here when he passed away.
That's my name.
We gave you your grandpa's name, but for me, you're my little Jacquot.
Seeing my name there when I was so young gave me a sense of the frailty of our existence.
I'm so lucky!
I saw a little old lady and grabbed her handbag.
No doubt about it, I'm as slippery as an eel.
- Guignol!
- He's stolen a bag!
I saw a policeman, so I've hidden it.
Here he comes!
Hello, Guignol.
Hello, Gnafron.
Hello, Brigadier.
Did you happen to see a suspicious individual?
A purse snatcher!
Did any of you kids see him around here?
He hid it under a bush!
All that for Reine?
It still smells of coffee in here.
Are you a turtle?
None of your business.
- Can I keep the box?
- Take it if you like.
I want to make a puppet theater.
What I hear about Munich's not good.
I wonder about that cousin from Rio.
Off to see her Mr. Schuster...
Probably a spy.
She seemed sweet, though.
How could anything go well?
Why go at all?
And where?
Madame de Saint-Clair is here.
I'd like to taper it at the neck.
Mr. Cavalet is home.
Will that do?
Almost.
I'll just give it one last...
You made a Negro policeman?
- No, I didn't.
- Why's he black, then?
The potatoes go black.
I know...
I'll make the heads out of cardboard.
Come along!
Hurry up, please!
- Next screening in 15 minutes!
- Snow White is pretty.
I liked the witch.
Of course you did.
- Grumpy's always grumpy.
- He didn't stop sneezing.
- That was Sneezy, dopey!
- You have to go see it.
It's great but scary.
My father promised to take me if I get good grades.
- I'm going again tomorrow.
- Me too.
I'm going on Sunday.
I've seen it too.
I like the witch best.
- He's into Snow White.
- Don't say that.
You said the was the one for you.
I didn't, but she's OK.
She always sings when she sweeps, when she washes up, and when she bakes cakes.
Mirror, mirror on the wall...
Mom they're outside!
Come see the giant dwarfs.
- You've got 'em all, even Dopey.
- Some chocolate?
Yes, please.
You're lucky to have 'em all.
Yes, please.
You're lucky to have 'em all.
No Snow White?
No, I couldn't care less about her.
She can't do the splits, but I can.
Now you try.
You're clumsy, try again.
Push down and stretch your legs.
We could do an acrobatic act and tour the world in a circus.
- If you like.
- Try again.
Push!
Keep it rolling with your stick.
The Three Musketeers!
Can you manage?
War!
Mobilization!
All we needed!
God knows where I'll be sent.
You have a bad leg, you'll stay here.
Take those sacks to the cellars for a shelter.
We need some in the attics too.
If my two sons go off to war...
They'll test gas masks at school.
Reine will look like a fly.
Me, a fly?
You have a fly up your nose, Jacquot too.
But you'd be a beautiful fly.
I've given him a big mustache.
Look, will this do?
Yes.
It fits!
She's the one with the hair.
- You don't hit puppets.
- Just a bit.
Think it's here?
- Raymond Marcel Demy?
- That's me.
Your posting.
The arsenal isn't far.
I'll be home every night.
Better to make shells than be hit by them.
Think they're asleep?
Check.
They're fine.
- Quite a change from a beret.
- Good luck, neighbor.
Your lunch bag.
Grandma, can you make a cape for my puppet?
Not black like that, but with this shiny cloth?
Of course, Jacquot, but I must finish this.
Look at these pearls...
The woman's coming for it tomorrow.
Then you can do mine next.
Sing me another song.
I like your songs.
- Do you know about witches?
- Not really.
They fly on broomsticks.
Do they wear Japanese kimonos?
You know all about costumes.
There's Grandma and Jacquot!
Four for Cinderella.
Coming, my little ones, my elephants...
Coupons?
150 francs.
Fine.
In Germany they've requisitioned cars.
My husband wrote to hide ours.
I can't decide.
- Where is he?
- The Maginot Line.
Mine's busy making shells.
But he gets home every night.
- What's wrong?
- My guests haven't come.
- Be patient.
- Go look.
Wait, I have an idea.
Ready, children and elephants?
Here we go.
Open the curtains.
Here's Cinderella.
I'm so unhappy...
My wicked sisters have gone to the ball and I'm cleaning up.
- Poor girl.
- Here I am.
I am the Fairy.
The Lilac Fairy.
Want to go to the ball?
Just watch.
Don't forget to leave at midnight.
First, I'll change your dress.
Here comes the stardust.
That's not stars, it's sand.
Lice!
Look at you!
Bend over the newspaper.
You know those Marchis kids are full of lice.
They clapped, Mom, and René and I bowed.
They're everywhere.
Let me see.
You can't, they're too small.
I'll put some lotion later.
- I've only got one left.
- I won these.
- You stole them.
- Don't argue.
Mind your own business, Demy.
- Give them back.
- I won them.
You're the cheat.
We'd better go, or we'll be late.
See you later.
Demy, a new poster!
"Silence.
Enemy ears are listening."
Are there enemies everywhere?
Of course!
Grandma and Mom read a book called Mr. Spy and His Daughter.
The spies were disguised as nuns.
You had to check their shoes.
Hurry up!
Don't dawdle, Demy!
- This OK?
- Fine.
Mask on.
If there's a real alert, I want no fuss.
Nuns!
Let's go check!
- Come with me to the toilet?
- Can't you go alone?
I'm scared.
I'm going to explore the cave...
There's a glow in the distance...
Come back, Jacquot!
- It's as dark as hell in there.
- What's hell?
I wanna go to the fair!
It's for soldiers on leave.
- Let's go to the Guignol.
- We'll take a quick look first.
Hitler's head for 5 francs!
- Now to the Guignol!
- Now?
You're good, Father dear, but before I marry you,
I want the skin of that old donkey.
Never!
I insist, Father dear.
I can't possibly refuse you.
I say there!
Kill my donkey and bring me his skin.
They won't really kill it...
How dreadful!
It's disgusting.
Fairy godmother, what shall I do?
- Disguise yourself...
- You have strange ideas.
Come on, hurry.
- Put this skin on.
- How awful!
Just do as I tell you.
From now on, we'll call you Donkey Skin.
Mom, there's no more school!
Due to the war.
Watch out.
Is the garage open?
Not really, but maybe the mechanic can help.
Can I have some water?
- Been on the road long?
- We've driven from Bruges.
Come in for a moment.
We fled.
We heard they were raping women and cutting off kids' hands.
We left in a panic.
Too late, Mrs. Demy.
We're closing.
For good?
The Germans will soon be here.
They ransack and kill.
- We're leaving.
- All of you?
We're going back to the farm.
- Are you off too?
- I don't know.
Do you want to leave?
I don't know.
The Germans are coming.
Are we going or not?
Where to?
I can't leave Grandma behind.
- Can you help us?
- Lend us some civilian clothes.
- Sorry, we're leaving.
- Over here, guys!
Get some overalls.
We don't even know if we're still at war.
Catch.
- Here.
- Thanks, boy.
- Isn't Reine here?
- No.
She's staying with my sister.
- No news of your husband?
- I'm still waiting.
I worry, but I go to work.
German's a weird language.
Hush!
Look at the poster...
You're taking them to the river?
Yes, I've got to pick up some mattresses.
- They'll keep the girl company.
- No swimming on their own!
Don't you worry.
Let's go!
You get in here.
René, you climb in the back.
She's a refugee, from friends of friends.
She was a wonder from Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois and very pretty indeed.
No, not like that.
Like this.
What's your name?
Geneviève from Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois.
Move your arms more.
Shall we show her the stairs?
Then, there's a little staircase.
Coming?
You keep watch.
My turn.
The witch's door is open.
Maybe it was burglars.
Let's look inside.
Can I see?
Think she's dead?
Hush, don't say a word.
Don't worry, it'll be fun.
- We won't be able to play cars.
- Then play cars now.
Off we go!
We're going for a drive.
Along the banks of the Loire.
Careful, I can't swim!
Put that down.
You mustn't touch everything.
They've got to have fun.
It's all new to them.
What's this for?
Pouring water on the grindstone to sharpen the tools.
Thirsty?
Then drink.
I've brought their things.
Old Georges told me to take kids from Nantes.
He told me the clog-maker is a good man.
Looks like he was right.
They seem pale.
The fresh air will do them good.
- We don't see the war here.
- Except there's no tobacco.
- I'll give you money.
- Later.
We'd better go.
- I've never left them.
- They're in good hands.
Come on.
Let's go feed the rabbits.
I want to feed the rabbits too.
- Bye, children.
- Bye!
You don't cut yourself on that knife?
I've been making clogs for 30 years.
Home we go, little fellow.
"My darlings,
"Here are some transfers
"...and a badge of the arms of Nantes,
"since you said you wanted a badge.
"Say hello to Aunt Léa and the clog maker.
"Big kiss from Dad and Mom,
"Marilou."
Not bad, huh?
Great badge.
They don't have them in the country.
- Where'd you get it?
- Little Demy, how you've grown!
The country air has done you good.
The washing.
Thank you.
Goodbye, Mrs. Le Dentec.
It's nice to have you back.
Jacquot, take off your beret.
I've made a real feast:
pasta with cheese and sausage, from the sausage lady.
- Luce, who sings in church?
- Indeed.
Glad to be home, boys?
Yes, Dad.
I wanna go to the cinema and the circus.
I'll take you, or your father will.
All Dad likes is boules!
It feels good to be a family.
Back to catechism class.
First Communion in May.
Yes, Mom.
- You're late.
- Catechism went on forever.
I know, so I hope you pass your First Communion test.
- Your sister passed first time.
- He knows.
He knows his catechism.
At least, I hope so.
Can you help us fix up a trapeze?
I'd better ask your dad, or you ask Guy.
This beam?
"Lift up your souls, yet remain modest,"
as our priest says.
- Missed!
- Your turn!
- You'll do it, Robert?
- Yes, later.
Look at Reine's shutters.
Isn't she back?
We don't see much of her.
She's taken on airs.
Field Commander Holt was shot in the back.
There's a curfew at 4 PM.
There'll be reprisals.
It happened on Rue du Roi Albert.
- On your way to catechism?
- Yes.
"Cowardly criminals working for England and Moscow
"shot the Nantes field commander in the back on October 20.
"The murderers have yet to be caught.
"To punish this crime
"I have ordered that 50 hostages be shot."
"Due to the gravity of the crime, 50 more hostages..."
- 15 million for informers!
- More than Judas got.
50 innocent people shot?
It's true.
My father said so.
The occupation:
A quiet war.
It's easy to lay down the law with guns.
- We shouldn't see German films.
- I know, my father told me.
But it looks terrific.
- And it's in color.
- What a pity.
Prévert wrote it.
It's a sad love story.
Let's see it.
Three for "Les Visiteurs du Soir."
Gluttony is a sin, my boy, but it's your First Communion.
Roast pork...
You've saved our bacon!
If you put it there it'll get cooked.
No, I'm using gas, it'll fool them at the checkpoint.
- Thanks.
- See you tomorrow.
I'll come early to help your wife.
Radio Paris lies...
Radio Paris is German!
We'll take the tape off the windows.
We took the flour and the sugar to the baker's.
How wonderful!
It's like before the war.
- An actual tiered cake.
- It's been ages.
- I can't eat anymore.
- I can.
Don't eat, Luce, sing.
Sing us a song!
Let's sing another.
"Little Lison."
It's going well.
You're as handsome as a prince!
What'd you get as a present?
A gramophone.
- Got any records?
- Two.
I can lend you some.
Listen to this, Guy.
Music?
Sure.
I like ball bearings.
It's great.
You can see all the chimneys.
You're lucky.
You can look again if you like.
Is it true you can see Le Normandie?
Yes.
Let's see.
- Let's swap.
- For what?
Ball bearings.
Two sets.
Yes.
See you.
What you showed Le Gerrec was film?
Yes, movie film.
- Where'd you find it?
- What'll you give me?
- Ball bearings.
- No.
- Two sets.
- I want the pencil sharpener.
Then give me the film and tell me where you found it.
- It's Le Normandie?
- Yes.
Watch out.
Gypsies are dangerous.
Don't ever go near them.
I don't care.
That's not why I came.
Mine's got a plane.
I think it's a Messerschmitt.
- I've got a tank.
- It's German newsreel.
We shouldn't have...
It must be forbidden.
It's OK, we found 'em in a dump!
- We oughta take 'em back...
- Don't be silly!
These spoils of war, a few feet of real film, eagerly brought home by Jacquot, had no time to become a fetish and catalyze his passion.
Marilou considered them to be "compromising documents."
Jacquot had lost Le Normandie for nothing.
Aunt Nique!
Your stocking seam looks like a snake!
Since I am asked to justify myself,
Monsieur Pitou loves Mademoiselle Clairette and she loves him too.
It's cold.
Those Krauts are ugly.
Jean Marais is handsome.
- 4:15.
What's the holdup?
- They like making us wait.
They take their time.
Look: "Filming on a farm:
Jean Choux and his crew."
- Ducks too.
- Some crew!
Jean Gourget's new film, "Malaria,"
will entirely be set in the Tropics.
About time.
"I want 'Malaria' to have an atmosphere of fear," he says.
"Mireille Balin plays a colonial wife suffering from malaria.
"Sessue Hayakawa plays a native boy, a guitar player.
"Love erupts between these two feverish beings."
- Mireille Balin's beautiful!
- "Beautiful"?
I know what I'm talking about.
That one doesn't look bad.
A guy falling from a tree.
There's blood everywhere!
He's sweet.
He blows up my tires.
Don't forget the valve.
You ride your mom around?
She's a neighbor.
She's going for her coupons.
Now you can go.
I'm going out to get some biscottes.
- I'm scared.
- We've got a shelter.
- I want to go.
- We'll all go.
What a racket.
It's hell!
I'm scared.
I feel sick.
It'll soon be over.
Look how calm Jacquot is.
Remember the cave?
It was as dark as hell.
I'm frightened.
On September 16, 1943,
I discovered the full horror of violence and destruction.
There were dead all over town, people screaming and dying beneath the rubble.
It was the Apocalypse.
Ever since, I've hated violence.
My city kids...
I knew we'd see you.
We thought we'd just show up.
There's no electricity.
It's a total disaster.
- It was dreadful.
- We heard it too.
Come see the rabbits.
Remember the white one?
It was all craters and smoke, people looking for each other...
I was in the street too.
People were trapped.
I heard them shouting.
- On your own?
- I was looking for Dad.
I was fixing a car on Avenue des Américains.
I got under it just in time.
- Americans?
You brought them.
- Don't be stupid.
Still, our allies bombing Nantes...
Destroying Nantes, you mean.
Filthy Krauts!
It's all their fault.
- We're no trouble?
- No, we'll all squeeze in.
I won't be here long.
I'll go back to the garage as soon as we get the electricity back.
He always has his gramophone.
Come on in.
Come to bed, Jacquot.
I'm sleepy.
- Go to sleep on your own.
- Under the covers, boy.
Are your feet all right now?
Yes.
You'll get used to them.
Finishing your clog today?
No, not that chisel.
Here.
I'm teaching you a trade, but you'll never take it up.
- You'll have better to do.
- I'm going to make sets.
Sets?
Theater and cinema sets, and puppet shows.
Don't walk over the bridge at Mauves!
Missed!
Enough reading for today.
Time to swap.
The past participle agrees with the gender and plural of the subject when it is placed before.
Example:
"La bille qu'il a prise est bleue."
What did he take?
"La bille."
- Listen to me.
- Things are heating up.
"Bille," feminine, precedes the verb, so the color is feminine too.
Don't be scared.
Every time I hesitate over a past participle agreement,
I recall the school classroom at Mauves and that parachute floating down over the Loire.
- A late visitor.
- Come in!
"Un Visiteur du Soir."
Here's our neighbor.
The Germans raided the café to get young men to do forced labor.
They took Gaston and Paul.
Luckily, the others managed to get away.
- Damn Germans!
- And Gilles too.
Gilles and Dominique, Dominique and Gilles...
They didn't take Dominique.
- From "Les Visiteurs du Soir."
- He only thinks about films.
You should go see the old Gallon sisters, the teachers.
They had a projector and some Chaplin films.
- Shorts.
- Great idea.
The boy's bored.
Be careful, OK?
- Regularly and gently.
- Fairly gently, actually.
Here are the films.
You'll bring it back, won't you?
This country lettuce is delicious.
We eat it every day.
- Pleased to see your parents?
- Yes.
Dad gave me a present.
Presents always work.
- What do we do?
- Don't move.
- Your bike!
- Be quiet.
Come, it's ready.
Look, Mom, the projector.
No, I'm the projectionist.
Look at the screen, Dad.
Sit down.
I've seen it.
- It doesn't work.
- Be patient.
What are they eating?
Soap?
Bubble soup!
Jacquot was as thrilled as if he'd made the film himself.
He happily ended his days at the clog maker's by showing films.
The Loire had become dangerous.
Americans occupied one bank,
Germans and the Resistance the other.
It was time to go home, back to the sand, the long porch, and the garage courtyard.
The Americans are here!
White wine for everyone!
Coming?
It's Chopin.
I like it here.
A jazzed-up Chopin!
- It sounds good.
- But it's written for the piano.
Thanks, I'll take it.
OK.
I've been in this scene before.
But the other was lent and this is a gift.
It's not worth much.
Dad'll buy an electric model.
When it's worth less, give it to me.
- I'm your junk-collector cousin.
- Don't be silly!
See you.
Where am I going to put my stuff?
You need room for a cinema.
You're going too far.
I need cardboard boxes, glue and fairy lights.
Give me some money?
- Chaplin is funny.
- I've seen it countless times.
Pillars just like at the Olympic.
He did it all himself except for the curtain.
Come have some coffee.
Let him put it away.
I've only got one film.
If only I could rub it out and change it.
- Don't ask me.
- You should buy me more.
Not now.
- Fix my hairdo?
- I don't do hair anymore.
What with the boys and the garage...
I even do the bookkeeping.
Let's see your hair...
- What are you up to?
- I'll try to make a new film.
- The saucepan will poison us.
- Tell Mom you'll rinse it well.
- I can't wait for the sequel.
- Same here.
I like when she says, "a glimmer like everyone."
She talks about her mother, a laundress.
It's a fine love story.
It's a masterpiece.
You'll ruin your eyes.
"The Bridge at Mauves."
- You can see the crossbars.
- It was hard to draw.
It's so tiny.
Mom, it's serious.
It's a cartoon newsreel.
Fine.
"The planes are flying away."
Did you like it?
It was very good.
Bras!
- He's into ladies' underwear!
- Just looking.
- Research.
- Today's youth...
Make your own way home, Jacquot.
Come see.
Women go into that shop and then they disappear.
- Who told you that?
- Someone.
- Them?
- Who knows?
- It's a fairy tale.
- No, a drama.
They're sold as slaves to harems in Argentina.
Sheet music.
Aunt Nique has the same one.
- What's what?
- Junk.
- Let's go!
- No, this is amazing.
Anything in particular?
No.
Actually, what's that camera with the handle in the window?
- A movie camera.
- To make real films?
- 9.5 mm.
For amateurs.
- Does it work?
If you put film in.
I'd love to be an amateur, but I don't have any money.
We could swap.
Got any books or games?
Slow down!
- What's eating him?
- He'll get over it.
How are you, Mr. Dubuisson.
Time for a fill-up and a chat.
I was looking for you.
Time to say good-bye.
I didn't want you to go knowing you were angry...
So I got the camera, but I had no idea how to use it.
Luckily, there was an instruction book.
I was in a hurry to learn all those barbaric terms like f-stop, orthochromatic film, panchromatic vision filter, film stock...
As soon as I'd read it, I decided I wanted to make the script used as an example:
- "Solange's Adventure."
- There you are.
I've learned lots of words:
Emulsion speed, f-stop, shutter, ortho, panchro, depth of field.
Good for you.
But it's all Chinese to me.
Is that what you learn at school?
"'Solange's Adventure.'"
Solange, 5, her parents, a prowler."
"Despite being forbidden to, Solange plays in the street.
'A prowler promises her sweets and kidnaps her."
Hey!
I'm making a film.
I need a tall guy for the gypsy.
Come Thursday to the garage?
- Where?
- Quai des Tanneurs.
OK, I'll come.
- I'll be home late.
- Don't worry.
It'll be open.
"A gipsy makes her dance at fairs,
"but her mother recognizes her thanks to a locket.
"This family film will have more appeal than a reel
"of some young star pointlessly posing..."
- You learn this at school?
- Yvon asked me that.
My fur!
- Lend it to me?
- What for?
For Yvon.
He's playing Solange's mother.
René's little brother is Solange.
- What's all this?
- Watch it!
I don't like being a girl.
We need a dress, makeup, and a hat.
I'll go to Madame Bredin's.
- It's ready.
- Thanks.
Reine used to wear it.
- This is a real circus.
- Stop making faces.
- You look pretty, Yvon.
- Come out.
Yvon, explain to Solange she mustn't go out alone.
Now walk slowly towards me.
Good.
That'll do.
Lorca, I'll show you where to go.
You hide here.
René...
We'll do a full-face shot of him.
Solange, you play with your ball, you drop it, and turn right.
You're the kidnapper!
"Soon after, a character offers her sweets,
"then wraps her in his cape."
Stride after her and offer her sweets.
- You like sweets, pretty girl?
- Yes, sir.
Then you'll get some!
Fight back!
"Six months later." Want to be older?
No, it's for my film.
Good news in the paper:
Germany has surrendered.
Move your belly without moving your feet.
Move your head too.
Now we'll do it with the others.
I'll place you with your drum.
You, dance.
You, beat time on the drum.
OK, I'm shooting.
Bang harder, Lorca.
Then the mother arrives.
Listen, we move back...
You come forward, and when you see her dancing, say, "Hey!"
Not now!
Move back!
When we're shooting.
Recognize your daughter.
That's Solange's locket!
What are you doing?
Wrapping up my first takes to send them to the Pathé Lab in Joinville-le-Pont.
- Nothing for me?
- Not today, son.
It'll be a fine cardigan.
You need patience to knit.
I'm the patient one.
I've been waiting two months!
The labs reopen, but I keep waiting.
I'm really fed up.
And you only knit for Dad!
Then one fine day, the film arrived.
What excitement!
I loaded it.
Not a thing!
It was absolutely, totally transparent.
I'd forgotten to adjust the f-stop.
Clearly, I had to learn the technique.
- What's wrong?
- I wanna go to film school.
We'll ask your father.
He'll say,
"Are you nuts?
Thinking about films at your age!"
"Are you nuts?
Thinking about films at your age!"
Learn a trade in a technical school.
You'll be a mechanic.
I want to go to high school.
Great, veal with prunes!
I want to graduate.
Tech gives you a trade.
High school, nothing.
Concentrate.
Go on, turn it.
If he picks on me again, I'm off.
- Where to?
- Who cares?
Africa, to teach mechanics to the locals.
That's it, clear off to Timbuktu!
I'd head for Paris.
I'd be an extra at the Opera.
They'll take anyone.
One of my mom's clients told me.
No need to sing, just hammer it out at the back.
I'll be all right at the Opera, then!
I absolutely must go to Paris.
I'm going too, but later on.
Dad says I must finish tech.
Meanwhile, I make films.
With that?
I have an idea for a film.
You'd be terrific in it.
But you and your camera are small-time.
I've got big projects.
Remember my aunt from Rio, the flirtatious one?
She batted her eyelashes.
She was fun.
- A great role.
- Wasn't she a casino gambler?
Yes.
We'll do a scene where you win lots of money.
Go back to your dreams, Jacquot.
I've got my own.
- How's it coming along?
- I've given up on actresses.
It's better to make cartoons.
The stars are cardboard in cardboard sets.
You want some cardboard?
- Can I have some?
- Of course.
Thanks, Mr. Sweets.
Am I Mr. Sweets forever?
- Can I come back for more?
- Whenever you like, son.
The boy had a project and he needed space.
The attic next to the tires was ideal and he made it his own.
A new life of peace and quiet started, far from the noise of the tech, a little less from that of the garage.
What are you making?
- A ballerina.
- What's that?
A dancing girl.
She looks different with her blond wig.
Who?
Viviane Romance.
She was in Carmen.
We saw that.
It was good.
- Nice costumes...
- Yes.
Directed by Marcel L'Herbier, so you know it's good.
Show me.
Or I won't get it.
Come on, then, I'll explain.
Look.
You're well set up.
Don't touch, it's fragile.
Not by the camera...
It's exactly in place.
If I want the little dancer to move,
I move her leg and shoot a frame.
I keep doing the same thing...
Got it?
It's continuous movement.
If you film an arm, you get continuous movement.
You can climb down now.
I really need to focus.
It's blurry and out of focus.
This is not good.
I've got the patience.
With a new camera, I'd start again.
I'm glad we're here.
I've talked to the merchant.
He says it's a bargain.
It's that one.
It's more stable.
Automatic beats cranking the handle.
If you say so.
Shall we go in?
It's your present.
Thanks so much.
This camera, an Ercsam Camex, was the one I used.
It shot frame by frame.
Car headlamps aren't ideal for lighting sets.
We're a bit tight.
People are paying late.
Mr. Debuisson owes me 2 months of work.
He's talking to Mom.
Hello, Mr. Debuisson!
How's the tech?
My marks are fine, but it's boring.
Not again!
It's hard for an artist not to get his own way.
- You should see the attic.
- You haven't!
I'm afraid of heights.
- Can I see?
- Of course.
The cartoon was terrific.
That's what I want to do.
I need equipment.
Every Sunday it's the same:
"I don't want to be a mechanic.
I want to study filmmaking."
We got him a camera.
Now he wants lights, a tripod...
It never ends!
- Calm down, Raymond.
- He should!
You're hard on Jacquot.
He works hard.
Let him have fun.
I forgot to buy a pound cake.
I'm not a baby.
Cake won't work.
Sweets never hurt those who sulk.
You've been fuming for an hour.
'Cause Dad drives me crazy.
It's a sin.
So is sulking.
Laugh!
Even if you're sad!
Ask your dad what happened when he came to Nantes from the country...
His "studio"
in a drunk's house, a Colonel's widow.
OK, here we go.
Turn it on, Yvon.
His father agreed to cut the door in half.
- Why?
- Projector noise.
We have the world's smallest cinema.
- I'm flattered to be invited.
- You're Jacquot's main supplier.
And my friend.
Let's open the curtains.
Screen!
Music!
Lights!
Short but sweet!
Sailors are fun.
Mountain-climbing's great.
The mountain can wait.
Beauty and the Beast is a must.
- Really?
- Yes!
I'd even see it again.
You let me help you, but you never let me in your attic.
That's normal.
- What should we go see, Demy?
- He always knows.
Actually,
Duvivier's "Untel Père et Fils" is good.
I've seen "Caprice," with Danielle Darrieux.
- We know what you think of her.
- Let's see.
Edith Piaf.
I adore her.
Quite the songbird.
- I'm making a film in my attic.
- What's it about?
A purse snatcher escaping over the roofs of Paris.
"Attaque Nocturne." It'll take months to complete.
Four seasons had passed.
Or a few, in any case.
Between fitting and welding, Jacquot's French teacher introduced him to classical music.
He bought a copy of this record, but remained faithful to the waltzes that suited "Attaque Nocturne."
Jacquot had grown.
He had changed.
When he came down for meals, he didn't say much, which worried his mother.
Yvon, Jacquot is here.
When his father came up for a new tire, he never looked at the cardboard city his son inhabited.
Yvon was becoming an athlete.
Jacquot visited his grandmother and went to the cinema a lot, or walked towards the port.
He was pulling at his moorings.
Jacquot was becoming Jacques.
He still whined about the tech.
I hated that technical school.
Thumping my sheet metal felt like hitting my father, or letting off steam.
I had to get out of there, find a solution.
While I made a mortise and tenon, it was Hollywood that was on my mind.
Is this going around the client's neck?
Start again.
Fitting a tire without the inner tube!
I'll give you a hand.
It ain't a champagne omelet.
- What were you thinking of?
- Hollywood, of course!
Some mechanic...
Rita has a shapely figure.
She was the GIs' mascot.
They had her everywhere.
Even on the dreaded Hiroshima bomb.
- You believe that?
- Yes, she was a bombshell.
Let's screen this film.
You'll see.
I saw it ages ago, it may be no good.
Still, let's take a look.
- Can I switch it on?
- Wait...
This way, please.
I like the title:
"Le Port de l'angoisse."
That's the French title.
Remember the scene where Bogart picks his passengers up?
- Yes, that's "day for night."
- It was shot in daylight.
- And the moonlight?
- There isn't any.
It's the sun's reflection through a red filter.
To shoot moonlight, you need sunshine as backlighting with a reflection on water, a shiny surface of some kind.
You need to have a precise angle between the camera, the backlit characters and the sun.
- How do you know?
- I learned it.
That dress is too tight.
At least they can see!
It's nothing to be proud of.
What do I say to people?
Friends and neighbors?
It's none of their business.
- You never tell me anything.
- Say I'm getting married.
- Good idea.
- Then I'll go find a husband.
- Quite a fuss!
- That's right.
What'll you do?
Nothing, but my mother wants me married.
- Who with?
- I don't know.
I don't know anyone who wants to and you're much too young.
- Coming to the carnival?
- I hate carnivals.
I'm going back upstairs.
Are you going?
I'm going with my chums to see Mr Obligi.
- He films for the news.
- Sure it's not to go dancing?
Come back for my baby's christening!
I'll just take a quick look.
What's your name?
Josiane.
I'm sick of operettas.
You see it all from one place.
At the movies, your eyes move.
You can see faces and details.
It's better.
- Dad!
My drawing teacher's here.
- Hang on.
I told you, remember?
The one who likes me.
Let me finish.
I asked him to drop by.
He's with Mom.
Come talk to him.
It's not reasonable to think about the cinema.
He tinkers in the attic.
I know he's very gifted.
But the cinema is another world.
Many are called, few are chosen.
Help him get rid of his illusions.
- He left?
- He was in a hurry.
Coffee?
- Didn't he say anything?
- Not really.
Coffee or cocoa, Jacquot?
- Why did he come, then?
- Come inside.
There's no love, Hélène.
Only proof of love.
Everything OK?
- Yes, fine.
- What's this setup?
Do you roller-skate?
To do sweeping crane shots,
I had fixed the camera on a roller skate.
I had a sort of sloping incline, all marked out in mm and cm.
I moved it down, shot a frame, moved it lower, and shot another.
Then I had to move my little man.
You make him come down the steps and I'll move the camera down, frame by frame.
We're trying it out speeded up.
I should finish up in close-up on the thief hiding down the manhole.
It should work, except when it comes to it...
It required great patience, which I'd always had.
Coming...
You're always the first.
- We don't see each other much.
- I don't have time.
You have to finish your film...
It's slowed up since we've been dating.
You remind me of the very pretty Françoise Christophe.
It's good.
Last night was great.
You're finally happy.
You're learning a trade.
You're doing well at tech.
You do your film.
You're calm.
Everything's fine.
I'm calm, but not happy.
You don't understand anything!
Look how calm I am!
Manual workers only receive a primary education, but know all about their trade.
Manual workers are strong with well-developed bodies.
Second, intellectual workers, bureaucrats for example, need exercise after work.
Intellectuals are not as strong as manual workers.
To conclude, the manual worker and the intellectual worker are totally different from each other.
Write it.
MAN'S PRIDE IS WORK WELL DONE
I feel as flat as my little men.
I've done my film, now I'm lost.
I was happy and sure of myself making it.
Now, there's only the tech, the final exam in 2 or 3 months and then...
I'm no longer even angry, and that's scary.
You're tired, it'll pass.
Your film is splendid.
Thanks, but only you come up here.
"Purse Snatcher" is good.
It's not "Purse Snatcher," it's "Nocturnal Attack."
I had to make films as I was sick to death of the garage.
He suggested I go see Fernand Jean at the Apollo, to see what he thought.
Remain confident.
I'll talk to Fernand Jean.
So I went to the Apollo theater with my projector and showed the film from the Apollo's projection room to the manager, who said,
"It's good.
You ought to be making films."
I told him my parents disagreed.
Later, Christian-Jaque came to Nantes to present his film "D'homme à hommes."
Where are you taking us?
To see "D'homme à hommes." You'll like it.
What's it about?
The founder of the Red Cross.
Christian-Jaque will be there.
- We've seen several of his.
- He's made 40!
OK, let's go.
I'm going on my bike.
At the intermission,
Christian-Jaque was kind enough to look at my film.
He thought it wasn't bad.
"You ought to make films," he said.
Then my father said,
"If you think the boy is good,
"then he'll go to Paris."
I left for Paris the following October.
First, I studied filmmaking, and I was out of work, then a filmmaker.
I met a woman filmmaker, we made a few films, then she gave me a fine son and now I paint.
Devils and wonders, winds and tides, far away the sea has gone out.
And you, like a strand of seaweed gently caressed by the wind, you move as you dream in the sands of the bed.
Devils and wonders, winds and tides, far away the sea has gone out.
But in your half-open eyes two tiny waves are still there.
Devils and wonders, winds and tides, two tiny tears, two tiny waves to drown myself in.
Translation:
Épilogue
I know the art of evoking happy moments!
Those scents, those unending kisses, will they be born again from that unfathomable abyss, like a rejuvenated sun rises in the heaven from the depths of the sea?
O scents, O unending kisses!
The night was growing dense like a wall and my eyes glimpsed yours in the dark.
And I drank your breath
- O sweetness, O poison - and your feet fell asleep in my brotherly hands.
The night was growing dense like a wall. "
Is it over?
No, it's not.
Come, Jacquot, it's the end.
Sometimes it starts again.
No, it doesn't.
Let's go.
Papa's waiting...
It's not finished...
I'm staying.
Show us yours, Jacquot.
What, now?
Don't you worry...
They do it later in the Army to measure and compare, so they know.
Know what?
Look out, someone's coming!
Put it back.
It's nothing to write home about.
You three again!
Hello boy, homework done?
That's right.
Is it done?
Not yet, Papa.
Do what your father says.
Hurry up, Madame Marilou... 5 litres exactly.
You're tops.
- Hurry!
Only one side is curled...
- I'm coming!
I'm on stage in an hour.
Papa didn't want it,
Mama neither.
Good little children
Obey their parents.
- That's in Act 2.
- Yes.
It's the donkey duet.
The curler is too hot.
Come down.
Stay away from that ladder.
Done your homework?
I left my bag in the garage.
- It's fixed?
- Yes.
It clunks when it's cold, but that's normal.
Thanks.
Hello, Demy Garage here...
I want to order a new car.
A black Citroën 7 CV.
The customer's in a hurry.
Damn kids...
Always blocking the stairs.
Jacquot!
I hate being late.
I wanted an orange.
Goodnight, Papa.
You should've come with us.
I know "Les Saltimbanques"...
You know, the one Mama curls...
It is love that consoles the poor...
In bed, "the poor".
Say your prayers.
Our Father who art in Heaven...
They are good boys.
Hail Mary full of grace...
Coming to give us a kiss, Mama?
A rich labourer, knowing his death was imminent, called his children in... and addressed them without witness.
Be sure not to sell what is ours, he said.
There is a treasure hidden within.
Jacques' childhood was his treasure and a source of inspiration for his films.
Now then... let me write.
He was writing about his memories and he talked about them a lot.
Anecdotes came back, forgotten names and suddenly remembered details.
He spoke of the little kitchen, the focus of family life.
And above all of his mother, who was the life and soul of it.
Do you remember our last date?
He liked remembering Sunday outings, when time passed slowly.
He had known what he called "a happy childhood".
Jacques recalled the arrival of a country cousin that a Brazilian industrialist had turned into an upmarket tart.
Wait here.
Hey, good-Iooking, is this Raymond's garage?
Raymond's my father.
What do you want?
You don't know me, but I'm your aunt from Rio.
Papa!
Someone to see you, Boss.
That's him.
Oh, it's you.
You look terrific.
Come and meet the wife.
It's that cousin I told you about, who went off to Brazil.
Don't touch, it's organza.
At last I know the whole family.
I'll take you all to La Cigale tonight.
Come here, you.
You're invited too.
Now I can kiss you...
Oops!
It's my lipstick.
Shall I sing you a song?
For God's sake, don't get up.
Go on, sing Papa.
You didn't miss our local wine?
Yes, I often think of "Gros Plant".
One day a producer said I ought to be in the movies.
So I did tests.
But "Gros Plan" means "Close-up"...
I thought he was offering white wine!
Let's drink to that!
Cheers!
Beautiful diamonds...
Yes.
So extravagant...
I've been spoiled too.
You really shouldn't have...
Don't you criticise me...
No, I'm pleased with my present.
I adore casinos, particularly roulette...
I had a run of good luck.
I just kept on winning.
That means presents for everyone...
me too.
You came on your own?
I'm joining Bill Schuster in Munich.
He's the right sort.
First, I'd like to visit Grandpa's grave.
I wasn't here when he passed on.
I will wait for you night and day
until your return...
I'm the one who laughs...
Who wants to please...
I'm Lola.
That's my name.
We gave you your Grandpa's name, but for me you're my little Jacquot.
Seeing my name there when I was so young gave me a sense of the fragility of our existence.
Ah, how lucky I am!
I saw a little old lady and grabbed her handbag.
I'm as slippery as an eel.
- Guignol!
- He's stolen a bag!
I saw a policeman so I've hidden it.
Here he comes!
Good day, Guignol.
Good day, Gnafron.
Good day, Brigadier.
I say, you wouldn't have seen a suspicious individual?
A bag snatcher!
Did any of you children see him around here?
He hid it under a bush!
Are you doing that for Reine?
It still smells of coffee in here.
What are you, a tortoise?
None of your business.
Can I keep this box?
Take it if you like.
I want to make a puppet theatre.
What I hear about Munich's not good.
I wonder about that cousin from Rio.
Off to see her Mr Schuster...
Probably a spy.
Yet she seemed sweet and kind.
How could anything go well?
Why go at all?
And where?
Madame de Saint-Clair is here.
I feel like tapering it at the neck.
Mr Cavalet is home.
Will that do?
Almost...
I'll just give it one last comb...
You made a Negro policeman?
No, I didn't.
Why's he black then?
The potatoes go black.
I know...
I'll make the heads out of cardboard.
Come along, everyone!
Hurry up, please!
Next show in 15 minutes!
Snow White is pretty.
I liked the witch.
I knew you would.
Grumpy's always grumpy.
He didn't stop sneezing.
That was Sneezy, dopey!
You must see the film.
It's terrific and scary.
My father promised to take me if I get good marks.
I'm going again tomorrow.
Me too.
I'm going on Sunday.
Hello.
I've seen it too.
I like the witch best.
He's got a crush on Snow White.
Don't say that.
You said the other day she was for you.
I didn't, but she's not bad.
She always sings when she sweeps... when she washes up... and when she bakes cakes.
Mirror, mirror on the wall...
I met three lads from my hometown
I was kissed by the youngest
Who was also the handsomest
He took me to his room
To talk of our hometown...
A whole bowl
A whole bowl of milk
Nice and creamy
Nice and creamy, please
Some sifted sugar
And then you mix
You mix it well
Mama, they're outside!
Come see, there are giant dwarfs.
You've got them all, even Dopey.
A bit of chocolate?
Yes, please.
You're lucky to have them all.
Haven't you got Snow White?
No, I don't care two hoots about her.
She can't do the splits.
I can.
You try.
Go on, clumsy, try again.
Push downwards...
Stretch your legs...
We could work up an acrobatics act and tour the world in a circus.
If you like.
Keep trying.
Push!
Keep it rolling with your stick...
The Three Musketeers!
I've got my pay...
Pass me a spanner.
Let me treat you to a lakeside lunch...
Can you manage?
Caroline, Caroline!
Put your best shoes on...
It's war!
Mobilisation!
That's all what we needed!
God knows where I'll be sent.
You with your bad leg, you'll stay here.
Take those sacks to the cellars for a shelter.
We need some in the attics too.
If my two sons go off to war...
They'll test gas masks at school.
Reine will look like a fly.
Me, a fly?
You have a fly up your nose and Jacquot too.
You'd be a beautiful fly.
I've given him a big moustache.
Look, will that do you?
Oh, yes.
It fits.
She's the one with the hair.
- You don't hit puppets.
- Just a bit.
You think it's here?
- Demy, Raymond Marcel?
- That's me.
It's your posting.
The arsenal isn't very far.
I'll be home every night.
Better to make shells than be hit by them.
Do you think they're asleep?
Check.
They're fine.
- Makes a change from a beret.
- Good luck, neighbour.
Your lunch bag...
Grandma, can you make a cape for my puppet?
Not black like that, but with this shiny cloth?
Of course, Jacquot, but I must finish this.
Look at these pearls...
The woman's coming for it tomorrow.
Then you can do mine next.
Sing me another song.
I like your songs.
There was a king who remained faithful to his beloved and left her a golden goblet...
- Do you know about witches?
- Not really.
They fly on broomsticks.
Do they wear Japanese kimonos?
You know all about costumes.
There's Grandma and Jacquot!
Four for Cinderella.
Coming, my little ones, my elephants...
Coupons?
150 francs.
Fine.
In Germany they've requisitioned cars.
My husband wrote to hide ours.
I can't decide.
- Where is he?
- The Maginot Line.
Mine's busy making shells.
But he does get home every night.
What is it?
My guests haven't come.
Patience.
Go look.
Hang on, I've had an idea.
Ready, children and elephants?
Off we go.
Open the curtains.
And here is Cinderella.
I'm so unhappy...
My wicked sisters have gone to the ball and I'm cleaning up the cinders.
Poor girl.
Here I am.
I am the Fairy.
The Lilac Fairy.
Want to go to the ball?
Just watch.
Don't forget to leave at midnight.
First, I'll change your dress.
Here comes the stardust.
That's not stars, it's sand.
You're lice-ridden!
Look at the state of you!
Bend over the newspaper.
You know those Marchis kids are full of lice.
They clapped, Mama, and René and I bowed.
They're everywhere.
Let me see.
You can't.
They're too small.
I'll put some lotion on later.
- I've only got 1 left.
- I won these.
- You stole them.
- Don't argue.
Mind your own business, Demy.
- Give them back.
- No, I won them.
You're the cheat.
Don't argue.
We'd better go, or we'll be late.
See you later.
Look, Demy, a new poster!
"Silence.
Enemy ears are listening."
Are there enemies everywhere?
It's no joke...
Grandma and Mama read a book called Mr Spy and His Daughter.
The spies were disguised as nuns.
You had to check their shoes.
Hurry up, you lot!
Don't dawdle, Demy!
- This OK?
- Fine.
Mask on.
If there's a real alert, I want no dawdling and no fuss.
Nuns!
Let's go check!
Come with me to the toilet.
Can't you go on your own?
I'm frightened.
I'm going to explore the cave...
There's a glow in the distance...
Jacquot, come back!
It's as dark as Hell in there.
What's Hell?
I want to go to the fair.
It's for soldiers on leave.
Let's go to the Guignol.
We'll take a quick look first.
Hitler's head for 5 francs!
- Now we go to the Guignol!
- Now?
You're good, Father dear, but before I marry you,
I want the skin of that old donkey.
My banker donkey?
Never!
I insist, Father dear.
I can't possibly refuse you.
I say there!
Kill my donkey and bring me his skin.
They won't really kill it...
How dreadful!
It's disgusting.
Tell me, my fairy godmother, what shall I do?
Disguise yourself...
You have bizarre ideas.
Come on, hurry.
- Put this skin on.
- Awful!
Just do as I tell you.
From now on, we'll call you:
Donkey Skin.
Mama, there's no more school!
Due to the war.
Watch out.
Is the garage open?
Not really...
Maybe the mechanic can help.
Can I have some water?
Been on the road long?
We've driven from Bruges.
Come in for a moment.
We ran for it.
People said they were raping women and cutting off children's hands.
We left in a panic.
Too late, Madame Demy.
We're closing.
For good?
The Germans will soon be here.
They ransack.
They kill.
We're leaving.
All of you?
We're going back to the farm.
Are you off too?
I don't know.
Do you want to leave?
I don't know.
The Germans are coming.
Are we going or not?
Where to?
I can't leave Grandma.
Can you help us?
Lend us some civilian clothes.
Sorry, we're leaving...
Over here, boys!
Get some overalls.
We don't even know if we're still at war.
Catch.
Here.
Thanks, boy.
- Isn't Reine here?
- No.
She's staying with my sister.
No news of your husband?
I'm still waiting.
I worry, but I go to work.
I'll translate for you...
German's a weird language.
Hush!
Look at the poster...
You're taking them to the river?
Yes, I've got to pick up some mattresses.
They'll keep the girl company.
Don't let them swim on their own!
Don't you worry.
Off we go!
You get in here.
René, you climb in the back.
She's a refugee, from friends of friends.
She was a wonder from Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois and very pretty indeed.
No, not like that.
Like this.
What's your name?
Geneviève from Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois.
You have to move your arms more.
Shall we show her the stairs?
Then, there's a little staircase.
Coming?
You keep watch.
My turn.
The witch's door is open.
Maybe it was burglars.
Let's look inside.
Can I see?
Do you think she's dead?
It's him again.
The metallurgist.
It's him.
It's wonderful.
Hush, don't say a word.
Don't worry.
It'll be fun.
We won't be able to play cars.
Then play cars now.
Off we go!
We're going for a drive.
Along the banks of the Loire.
Careful.
I can't swim.
Put that down.
You mustn't touch everything.
They've got to have fun.
It's all new to them.
What's this for?
Pouring water on the grindstone to sharpen the tools.
If you're thirsty, drink.
I've brought their things.
Old George told me to take kids from Nantes.
He told me the clog-maker is a good man.
Looks like he was right.
They seem pale.
The fresh air will do them good.
We don't see the war here.
Except there's no tobacco.
- I'll give you money.
- Later.
We'd better go.
I've never left them.
Don't fret.
We'll look after them.
Come on.
Let's go feed the rabbits.
I want to feed the rabbits too.
- Bye, children.
- Bye.
You don't cut yourself on that knife?
I've been making clogs for 30 years.
Home we go, little fellow.
"My darlings,
"Here are some transfers
"...and a badge of the arms of Nantes,
"since you said you wanted a badge.
"Say hello to Aunt Léa
"and the clog-maker.
"Big kiss from Papa and Mama,
"Marilou."
Not bad, huh?
Your badge is great.
They don't have them in the country.
Where'd you get it?
Little Demy...
You've grown!
The country air has done you good.
Here's the washing.
Thank you.
Goodbye, Madame Le Dentec.
It's nice to have you back.
Jacquot, take your beret off at table.
I've made a real feast:
Pasta with cheese and sausage, from the sausage lady.
- Luce, who sings in church?
- Yes.
Glad to be home, boys?
Yes, Papa.
I want to go to the cinema and the circus.
I'll take you, or your father will.
All Papa likes is boules!
It feels good.
We're a family.
Back to catechism class.
First Communion in May.
Yes, Mama!
You're late...
Catechism went on for ever.
I know.
So I hope you pass your First Communion test.
- Your sister passed first time.
- He knows.
He knows his catechism.
At least, I hope so.
Can you help us fix up a trapeze?
I'd better ask your Papa, or you ask Guy.
This beam?
"Lift up your souls, yet remain modest", as our priest says.
- Missed!
- Your turn!
You will do it, Robert?
Yes, later.
Look at Reine's shutters.
Is she not back?
We don't see much of her.
She's taken on airs.
Feldkommandant Holt was shot in the back.
There's a curfew at 4 p.m.
There'll be reprisals.
It happened on Rue du Roi Albert.
- On your way to catechism...
- Yes, that's it.
"Cowardly criminals working for England and Moscow...
"...shot the Nantes Feldkommandant in the back...
"on 20 October.
"The murderers have not been caught.
"To punish this crime
"I have ordered that 50 hostages be shot. "
"Due to the gravity of the crime, 50 more hostages..."
- 15 million for informers!
- More than Judas got.
50 innocent people shot.?
It's true.
My father said so.
The occupation:
A quiet war.
It's easy to lay down the law with guns.
We mustn't see German films.
I know.
My father told me.
It looks terrific though.
And it's in colour.
What a pity.
Prévert wrote it.
A sad love story.
Let's see it.
Three for Les Visiteurs du Soir.
Gluttony is a sin, my boy, but it is your First Communion.
Roast pork...
You've saved our bacon!
If you put it there it will get cooked.
No, I'm using petrol.
That'll fool them at the checkpoint.
- Thanks.
- See you tomorrow.
I'll come early to help your wife.
Radio Paris lies...
Radio Paris is German!
We'll take the tape off the windows.
We took the floor and the sugar to the baker's.
It's magnificent.
It's like before the war.
A real tiered cake.
It's been so long.
- I can't eat any more
- I can.
Don't eat, Luce, sing.
Sing us a song!
I laugh to see myself so lovely in the mirror!
Let's sing another.
"Little Lison".
It's going well.
She raises her bottom like her mother
And with her glass, she says "Bottoms up!"
You're as handsome as a prince!
What present did you get?
A gramophone.
Got any records?
Two.
I can lend you some.
Some water will do them good.
No water!
Water drinkers are nasty, as was proved by the Flood.
Listen to this, Guy.
Music?
Any time.
The clock goes tick-tock
The birds go cheep-cheep
The turkeys go gobble-gobble
And the bell goes ding-dong...
But when my heart goes boom
Everything else goes boom
As love wakes up.
I like ball bearings.
It's terrific.
You can see all the funnels.
You're lucky.
You can look again if you like.
Is it true you can see Le Normandie?
Yes.
Let me see.
- I'll swap you.
- For what?
Some ball bearings.
Two sets.
Yes.
Bye.
What you showed Le Gerrec was film?
Yes, movie film.
- Where'd you find it?
- What'll you give me?
- Ball bearings.
- No.
Two sets.
I want the pencil-sharpener.
Then give me the film and tell me where you found it.
- It's Le Normandie?
- Yes.
Watch out.
Gypsies are dangerous.
You mustn't go near them.
I don't care.
That's not why I came.
Mine's got a plane.
I think it's a Messerschmitt.
- I've got a tank.
- It's German newsreel.
We shouldn't have...
It must be forbidden.
Listen, we found it on a dump!
- We ought to take it back...
- Don't be silly.
These spoils of war, a few feet of real film, eagerly brought home by Jacquot, had no time to become a fetish and catalyze his passion.
Marilou swept them away as rubbish or as "compromising documents".
Jacquot had lost Le Normandie for nothing.
Hey, Aunt Nique!
Your stocking seam looks like a snake!
Since I am asked to justify myself,
Monsieur Pitou loves Mademoiselle Clairette and she loves him too.
Yes, I tell you.
It's for her that Monsieur is here.
It's cold.
Those Krauts are ugly.
Jean Marais is handsome.
4:15.
What are they waiting for?
They like making us wait.
They take their time.
Look: "Filming on a farm:
Jean Choux and his crew."
- Ducks too.
- Some crew!
Jean Gourget's new film, Malaria, will take place entirely in the tropics.
About time.
"I want Malaria to have an atmosphere of fear", he says.
"Mireille Balin plays a colonial wife suffering from malaria.
"Sessue Hayakawa plays a native boy, a guitar player.
"Love erupts between these two feverish beings."
- Mireille Balin's beautiful!
- Beautiful?
I know what I'm talking about.
That one doesn't look bad.
A guy falling from a tree.
There's blood everywhere!
He's sweet.
He blows up my tires.
Don't forget the valve.
You bike your mother around?
No.
She's a neighbour.
She's going for her coupons.
Now you can go.
I'm going out to get some biscottes.
I'm scared.
We've got a shelter.
- I want to go.
- We'll all go.
What a racket.
It's Hell.
I'm frightened.
I feel sick.
It'll soon be over.
Look how calm Jacquot is.
Remember the cave where it was as dark as Hell?
I'm frightened.
On September 16th, 1943
I discovered the full horror of violence and destruction.
There were dead all over town, people screaming, and dying beneath the rubble.
It was the Apocalypse.
Ever since
I've hated violence.
My city kids...
I knew we'd see you.
We thought we'd just turn up.
There's no electricity.
It's all broken down.
A total disaster.
It was dreadful.
We heard it here.
Come see the rabbits.
Remember the white one?
Of course.
It was all craters and smoke...
people looking for each other...
I was in the street too.
People were trapped.
I heard them shouting.
- On your own?
- I was looking for Papa.
I was fixing a car on the Avenue des Américains.
I got under it just in time.
The Americans?
You brought them.
Don't be stupid.
It's hard to figure out:
Our allies bombing Nantes.
Destroying Nantes, you mean.
Filthy Germans!
It's all their fault.
We're no trouble?
None at all.
We'll all squeeze in.
I won't be here long.
I'll go back to the garage as soon as we get the electricity back.
He always has his gramophone.
Hello, hello, James.
What's new?
Since my fortnight away?
I'm calling you to discover
What I'll find on my return...
All is well, Madame la Marquise.
All is very well.
But we must tell you that there's been a slight problem...
Come on.
Inside.
Come to bed, Jacquot.
I'm sleepy.
Go to sleep on your own.
Under the covers, boy.
Are your feet all right now?
Yes.
You'll get used to them.
Finishing your clog today?
No, not that chisel.
Here.
I'm teaching you a trade, but you'll never take it up.
You'll have better to do.
I'm going to make sets.
Sets?
Theatre and cinema sets, and puppet shows.
Don't walk over the bridge at Mauves!
Missed!
After you,
I'll never love again...
After you, my heart will be broken for ever...
Enough reading.
Home we go.
We'll swap over.
The past participle agrees with gender and plural of the complement when it is placed before.
For example:
La bille qu'il a prise est bleue.
What did he take?
La bille.
Listen to me, boys.
Things are getting hot up there.
Bille is feminine and before the verb so the colour is feminine too.
Don't be scared.
Every time I hesitate over a past participle agreeing,
I recall the school classroom at Mauves and that parachute floating down over the Loire.
A late visitor.
Come in.
"Un Visiteur du Soir".
Here's our neighbour.
The Germans raided the café to get young men for forced labour.
They took Gaston and Paul.
The others had made themselves scarce.
Damned Germans!
And Gilles too.
Gilles and Dominique, Dominique and Gilles...
No, they didn't take Dominique.
It's from Les Visiteurs du Soir.
Films...
That's all he thinks about.
You ought to go see the old Gallon sisters, the teachers.
They had a projector and some Chaplin films.
Some shorts.
Good idea.
The boy's bored stiff.
You'll be careful?
Regularly and gently.
Not too gently, fairly gently.
Here are the films.
You'll bring it back, won't you?
This country lettuce...
It's delicious.
We eat it every day.
- Pleased to see your parents?
- Yes.
Papa gave me a present.
Presents always work.
- What do we do?
- Keep still.
Your bicycle!
Be quiet.
Come in, it's all ready.
Look, Mama, the projector.
Don't touch.
I'm the projectionist.
Look at the screen, Papa.
Sit down.
I've seen it.
It doesn't work.
Be patient.
It will.
What is it?
Soap?
It's bubble soup!
Jacquot was as delighted as if he'd made the film himself.
Happily showing films, he ended his days at the clog-maker's.
The Loire had become dangerous, with Americans on one bank,
Germans and the Resistance on the other.
It was time to go home, back to the sand, the long porch, and the garage courtyard.
When we sing at cherry blossom time, the nightingale and the mockingbirds all have a wonderful time...
But it doesn't last for ever, cherry blossom time, when some people go to gather earrings in a dream...
The Americans are here!
White wine, Raymond!
Coming?
It's Chopin.
I recognise it.
I like it here.
Poor Chopin, all jazzed up.
It sounds fine.
But it's written for the piano.
Thanks, I'll take it.
O.K.
I've been through this before, except the other was lent and this is a gift.
Don't thank me.
It's worthless.
Papa will buy an electric one.
When you're fed up, you can give it to me.
I'm your junk cousin.
Don't be silly!
Bye, old man.
Where am I going to put all my things?
You need room for a cinema.
You're not fair.
I need cardboard boxes, glue and fairy lights.
Will you give me money?
This Chaplin is funny.
It's for you.
I've seen it forwards and backwards.
Look at the screen:
Pillars just like at the Olympic.
He did it all himself except for the curtain.
Come have some coffee.
Let him put it away.
I've only got one film.
If only I could rub it out and change it.
Don't ask me.
You ought to buy me more.
It's not the time.
Will you fix my hairdo?
I don't do hair any more.
What with the boys and the garage...
I even do the book-keeping, look.
Let's see your hair...
What are you up to?
I've had an idea how to make a new film.
The saucepan will poison us.
Promise Mama you'll rinse it well.
- I can't wait to see Part Two.
- Me neither.
I like her saying, "a glimmer like everyone;"
and talking about her mother, who was a laundress.
It's a fine love story.
It's a masterpiece.
You can't see.
You'll ruin your eyes.
"The bridge at Mauves."
You can see the crossbars.
It was hard to draw.
It's so tiny.
Mama, it's serious.
It's a cartoon newsreel.
It's very good.
"The planes are flying away."
Did you like it?
It was very good.
Look, bras!
- Straight to the ladies' underwear!
- Just looking.
Research.
The clean minds of today's youth...
You make your own way home, Jacquot.
Come see.
Women go into that shop and then they disappear.
Who told you?
Someone.
I just heard.
- Those two?
- Hard to tell.
- It's a fairy tale.
- No, a drama.
They're sold as slaves to harems in Argentina.
Look, sheet music.
Aunt Nique has the same.
- What's what?
- Old junk...
- Let's go.
- No.
This shop's amazing.
Something in particular?
No.
Yes...
What's that camera with the handle in the window?
A movie camera.
For real films?
9.5 mm.
For amateurs.
Does it work?
If you put film in.
I need it.
I want to be an amateur.
But I haven't any money.
Have you nothing to swap?
Books or games?
Why are you rushing about?
- He's got ants in his pants!
- He'll get over it.
All right, Mr Dubuisson?
We fill the tank.
We have a chat.
I was looking for you...
I didn't want you to go knowing you were angry...
So I got the camera, but I had no idea how to use it.
Luckily, there was an instruction book.
I was in a hurry to learn all those barbaric terms like f-stop, orthochromatic film, panchromatic vision filter, film stock...
As soon as I'd read it, I decided I wanted to make the script used as an example:
"Solange's Adventure".
There you are.
I've learned lots of words:
Emulsion speed, f-stop, shutter, ortho, panchro, depth of field.
Good for you.
But it's all Chinese to me.
What is it?
Is that what you learn at school?
"'Solange's Adventure'.
Actors:
Solange (5), her parents, a prowler. "
Off we go.
"Despite being forbidden to, Solange plays in the street.
'A prowler promises her sweets and kidnaps her. "
Hey, I'm making a film.
I need a big chap for the gypsy.
Can you come Thursday to the garage?
On Quai des Tanneurs?
I know.
I'll come.
- I'll be home late.
- Don't worry.
It'll be open.
"A gipsy makes her dance at fairs,
"but her mother recognises her thanks to a locket.
"This film for all the family will have more appeal than a reel
"of some young star pointlessly posing..."
- You learn this at school?
- Yvon asked me that.
That's my fur.
- Will you lend it to me?
- What for?
For Yvon.
He's playing Solange's mother.
René's little brother is Solange.
- What's all this?
- Watch your cocoa!
- I don't like being a girl.
- I wouldn't mind!
We need a dress, make-up, and a hat.
I'll go to Madame Bredin's.
- I've got it ready.
- Thanks.
It's an old dress of Reine's.
This circus of yours is causing havoc.
Stop making faces.
You look pretty, Yvon.
Come out.
Yvon, explain to Solange she mustn't go out alone.
Now, walk slowly toward me.
Good.
That'll do.
Here, Lorca, I'll show you where to go.
You hide here.
René...
We'll do a full-face shot of him.
Solange, you play with your ball.
Drop it... and turn right.
You're the kidnapper!
Look.
"Soon after a character offers her sweets,
"then wraps her in his cape."
So you stride after her and offer her sweets.
- Do you like sweets, pretty girl?
- Yes, sir.
Then you'll get some!
Go on.
Fight back!
"Six months later." Want to be older?
No, it's for my film.
Today, there's good news:
Germany has surrendered.
Belly-dancing means moving your belly without moving your feet.
You try.
Move your head too.
Now we'll do it with the others.
I'll place you with your drum.
You, dance.
You, beat time on the drum.
We'll shoot.
Get on with it.
Bang harder, Lorca.
Then, the mother arrives.
Now, listen!
We move back.
You come forward.
When you see her dancing, you say, "Hey!"
Not now.
Move back!
When we shoot.
Recognise your daughter.
But that's Solange's locket!
Mama!
What are you doing?
I'm wrapping up my first takes to send them to the Pathé Lab at Joinville-le-Pont.
Nothing for me?
Not today, my boy.
In the Far West, when night falls
Cowboys gather round the fire
And sing an old song
About beautiful Texas...
It's going to be a fine cardigan.
Knitting takes so long.
Patience.
I'm the patient one.
I've been waiting two months.
The labs reopen, but I still wait and wait.
It's no joke.
I'm fed up.
And you only knit for Papa!
Then one fine day the film arrived.
What excitement.
I loaded it on to my projector.
Not a thing.
It was absolutely, totally transparent.
I had forgotten to adjust the f-stop.
It was clear I had to learn the technique.
What's wrong?
I want to go to film school.
We'll ask your father.
I know what he'll say:
"Are you crazy?
Thinking about films at your age!"
Learn a trade in a technical school.
You'll be a mechanic.
I want to go to high school.
Whoopee, veal with prunes!
I want to graduate.
Tech gives you a trade.
High school, nothing.
Set your minds to it for once.
Go on.
Turn it.
If he picks on me again, I'm off.
- Where to?
- Who cares?
Africa, to teach mechanics to the Negroes.
That's it.
You clear off to Timbuktu!
Me, I'd head for Paris.
I'll load crates or be an extra at the Opera.
They'll take anyone.
One of my mother's clients told me.
You don't have to sing, just hammer it out at the back.
I'll be all right at the Opera then!
I won't spend my life teaching dance
I'll go to Paris, take a chance
Why teach pliés and entrechats
When I want to dance at the Opera?
We are a pair of twins
Born in the sign of Gemini...
I absolutely must go to Paris.
I'm going too, but later.
Papa says I must finish tech.
Meanwhile, I make films.
With that?
As it happens,
I've had an idea for a film and you'd be terrific in it.
Are you kidding?
You and your camera are too small.
I've got big projects.
Remember my aunt from Rio, how flirtatious she was?
She batted her eyelashes.
She was fun.
- It's a great role.
- Wasn't she the casino gambler?
Yes, that's her.
With a scene where you'd win lots of money.
Don't you want to?
Back to your dreams, young Jacquot.
I've got my own.
How's it going?
I give up on actresses.
It's better to make cartoons.
The stars are cardboard in cardboard sets.
I see.
You want some cardboard?
- Can I have some?
- Of course you can.
Thanks, Mr Sweets.
Am I Mr Sweets for ever?
Can I come back for more?
Whenever you like, boy.
The boy had a project and he needed space.
The attic next to the tires was ideal and he made it his own.
A new life of peace and quiet began, far from the noise of the tech, a trifle less from that of the garage.
What are you making?
- A ballerina.
- What's that?
A girl who dances.
Look at her with that blonde wig.
Who?
Viviane Romance.
She was in Carmen.
We saw that.
It was good.
- Nice costumes...
- Yes.
It's a film by Marcel L'Herbier, so you know it's good.
Show me.
Otherwise I don't get it.
Come on then, I'll explain.
Look.
You have a nice setup.
Don't touch.
It's fragile.
Not by the camera...
It's exactly in place.
If I want the little dancer to move,
I move her leg and shoot a frame.
Got it?
It's continuous movement.
If you film an arm you get continuous movement.
Now you can climb down.
I need all my concentration.
It's no damn good!
It's blurred, out of focus.
No good at all.
I've got patience.
If I had a new camera I'd begin again.
It's nice being here with you.
I've been twice and talked to him.
He says it's a bargain.
It's that one.
It's more stable.
Automatic is better than cranking the handle.
If you say so.
Shall we go in?
It's your present.
I'm glad I have you.
This camera, an Ercsam Camex, was the one I used.
It shot frame by frame.
Car headlamps are not the right thing for lighting sets.
We're a bit short.
People are paying late.
Your chum, Mr Debuisson owes me 2 months.
He's talking to Mama.
Hello, Mr Debuisson!
How's the tech?
My marks are O.K., but it's so dull.
Not again...
For an artist, it's hard not getting your own way.
- You should see the attic.
- You've never seen it!
I can't stand heights!
- Can I see?
- Of course.
The cartoon was terrific.
That's what I want to do.
I need equipment.
Christ on a bike!
Every Sunday the same thing:
"I don't want to be a mechanic.
I want to study film making."
We got him a camera.
Now he wants lights, a tripod...
God knows what else!
- Calm down, Raymond.
- I wish he would!
You're tough on Jacquot.
He works hard.
Let him have fun.
A foreign girl arrived in Paris
Having crossed the globe
She settled in our fine country
But she had left something behind in Chile
She had left something behind...
And I forgot to buy a Madeira cake.
I'm not a baby.
Cake won't work.
Sweet things never hurt grouches.
You've been sitting there for an hour fuming with rage.
You know why?
Papa drives me mad.
Don't say that.
It's a sin.
So is sulking.
Laugh, you clown.
Even if you're sad!
Ask your Papa to tell you what happened when he came to Nantes from the country...
His "room in town"
in a drunk's house, a Colonel's widow.
Thank you, Guilbaud.
Have a drink with me.
I'm sure it'll cheer you up.
You've drunk enough tonight.
No?
Too bad for you.
You're already drunk as a skunk.
The way you speak amuses me.
As drunk as a skunk, indeed!
I'll just drink to your health.
And now the show begins...
Turn it on, Yvon.
His father agreed to cut the door in half.
Why?
Projector noise.
The smallest cinema in the world.
I'm flattered to be invited.
You're our son's main supplier.
My supplier and friend.
Turn the light off, Yvon.
Open the curtains.
Screen!
Music!
Lights, Yvon.
Short, but very sweet!
Sailors are fun.
Mountain-climbing's great.
The mountain can wait.
You must see Beauty and the Beast.
- Think so?
- You bet.
If you do, I'll go again with you.
You accept me if I draw, but you never let me in your attic.
That's normal.
Demy, come tell us what to see.
He always knows.
We must see...
Duvivier's Untel Père et Fils.
It's good.
I've seen Caprice with Danièle Darrieux.
We know what you think of her.
Let's see.
Edith Piaf.
I adore her.
She sings really well.
I'm making a film in my attic.
A bag snatcher escaping over the roofs of Paris.
It's called "Attaque Nocturne".
I'll be tied up for months.
Four seasons had passed, or a number, anyway...
Between fitting and welding,
Jacquot's French teacher introduced him to classical music.
He bought a copy of this record, but remained faithful to the waltzes which suited 'Attaque Nocturne".
Jacquot had grown.
He had changed.
When he came down for meals, he didn't say much, which worried his mother.
All right, Yvon, Jacquot's here.
When his father came up for a new tire, he never looked at the cardboard city his son lived in.
Yvon had become a sportsman.
Jacquot visited his grandmother and went to the cinema a lot... or walked towards the port.
He was pulling at his moorings.
Jacquot was becoming Jacques.
He still complained about the tech.
I hated that technical school.
Thumping my sheet metal felt like hitting my father, or letting off steam.
I had to get out of there, find a solution.
While I made a mortise and tenon,
I was thinking of Hollywood.
Where's this going?
Round the client's neck?
Start again.
Fitting a tire without the inner tube!
Hang on, I'll give you a hand.
It's not a champagne omelette.
What were you thinking of?
Hollywood, of course!
Some mechanic...
Rita has a terrific figure.
She was a G.I. Mascot.
They had her everywhere, even on that awful Hiroshima bomb.
- You believe that?
- Yes, Rita was the bombshell.
We'll screen this film.
You'll see.
It's ages since I saw it, it may be no good.
Let's take a look all the same.
- Can I switch it on?
- Wait...
This way, please.
I like the title:
"Le Port de I'Angoisse".
That's the French title.
Remember the scene where Bogart picks his passengers up.
Yes, that's "day for night".
It was shot in daylight.
- And the moonlight?
- There isn't any.
It's the sun's reflection through a red filter.
To shoot moonlight, you need sunshine as backlighting with, say, a reflection on water, a shiny surface of some kind.
You need to have a precise angle between the camera, the backlit characters and the sun.
How do you know?
I learnt it.
That dress is too tight.
At least they can see!
It's nothing to be proud of.
What do I say to people?
Who to?
Friends, neighbours?
It's none of their business.
You never tell me anything.
Make it up.
Say I'm getting married.
- A good idea.
- Then I'll go find me a husband.
- What a business.
- As you can see.
What are you going to do?
Me, nothing, but my mother wants me married.
Who with?
I don't know.
I don't know anyone who wants to and you're far too young.
Coming out?
I hate carnivals.
I'm going back upstairs.
Are you going?
I'm going with my chums to see Mr Obligi.
He films for the news.
- You say that, then go dancing.
- No, I don't.
Come back for my baby's christening!
I'll just take a look...
What's your name?
Josiane
How silly these people are!
I hate carnival time.
Don't be so bitter, darling.
Look how big you are.
You carry it in front.
It'll be a boy, or twins.
No, everything's fine.
I'm sick of operetta.
You see it all from one place.
At the movies, your eye moves.
You can see faces and details.
It's better.
Papa!
Papa, quick!
My drawing teacher...
Hang on.
I told you, remember?
The one who likes me.
Let me finish.
I asked him to drop by.
He's with Mama.
Come talk to him.
It's not very reasonable to think about the cinema.
He tinkers in the attic.
I've seen bits.
He's gifted.
No doubt, but the cinema is another world.
Many are called, few chosen.
I advise you to rid him of his illusions.
- Has he gone?
- He was in a hurry.
Coffee, Raymond?
- Didn't he say anything?
- Not really.
Do you want coffee, or cocoa?
Why did he come then?
Come inside.
There's no love, Hélène.
Only proof of love.
If life's mysteries add up to nothing
Don't think, don't think about it too much.
Why does the rain come from above?
Don't think, don't think about it too much.
Why does the moon have an influence
On the tides of the Seven Seas?
Why do peacocks go "Lee-oo" while cocks "Cockle-doo-doo"?
Don't think, don't think about it too much.
Everything O. K?
- Yes, fine.
- What's this setup?
Roller-skating on the set?
To do voluptuous crane shots,
I had fixed the camera on a roller skate.
I had a sort of sloping incline, all marked out in millimetres and centimetres.
I moved it down, shot a frame, moved it lower and shot another.
Then I had to move my little man.
You make him come down the steps and I'll move the camera down, frame by frame.
We're trying it out speeded up.
I should finish up in close-up on the thief hiding down the manhole.
It ought to work, except when it comes to it...
It required great patience, but I had always had that.
Coming...
You're always the first.
- We don't see each other much.
- I don't have time.
You have to finish your film...
It's slowed up since we've been going out.
You do look like Françoise Christophe.
I think you're very pretty.
It's good.
Last night was fun.
At last you're happy.
You're learning a trade.
You're doing well at tech.
You do your film.
You're calm.
Everything's fine.
I'm calm but I'm not happy.
You understand nothing!
I've no choice.
Look how calm I am!
Manual workers only receive a primary education, but know all about their trade.
Manual workers are generally strong with well-developed bodies.
Secondly, intellectual workers, bureaucrats for example, need exercise after work.
Intellectuals are not as strong as manual workers.
To conclude, the manual worker and the intellectual worker are totally different from each other.
Write it down.
MAN'S PRIDE IS WORK WELL DO NE
I feel as flat as my little men.
Now I've done my film, I'm at a loose end.
I was happy making it, sure of myself.
Now, there's only the tech, the final exam in 2 or 3 months and then...
I'm not even angry any more.
That's what's scary.
You're tired.
It'll pass.
What I've seen of your film is ace.
That's what you say.
Only you come up here.
Your "Bag Snatcher" is good.
It's not "Bag Snatcher".
It's "Nocturnal Attack".
I said I had to make films as I was sick to death of the garage.
He kindly told me I should go see Fernand Jean at the Apollo, to find out what he thought.
Remain confident.
I'll talk to Fernand Jean.
So I went to the Apollo cinema with my projector and showed the film from the Apollo's projection room to the manager who said,
"It's good.
You ought to be making films."
I told him my parents didn't agree...
Later, Christian-Jaque came to Nantes to present his film D'homme à hommes.
Where are you taking us?
To see D'homme à hommes.
You'll like it.
What's it about?
The chap who founded the Red Cross and Christian-Jaque will be there.
- We've seen several of his.
- He's made 40!
All right.
Let's go.
I'm going on my bike.
At the intermission,
Christian-Jaque was kind enough to look at my film.
He saw it and thought it wasn't bad.
"You ought to make films", he said.
And my father then said,
"Well, if you think the boy can do any good,
"then he'll go to Paris."
I left for Paris the following October.
First, I studied film-making and I was out of work, then a filmmaker.
I met a woman filmmaker, we made a few films, then she gave me a fine son and now I paint.
Devils and wonders, winds and tides, far away the sea has gone out.
And you, like a strand of seaweed gently caressed by the wind, you move as you dream in the sands of the bed.
Devils and wonders, winds and tides, far away the sea has gone out.
But in your half-open eyes two tiny waves are still there.
Devils and wonders, winds and tides, two tiny tears, two tiny waves to drown myself in.

WILLY:
Nice result on the Kingston case, John.
Thank you, Willy, my son.
D.C.I. Shefford.
I'm in charge.
- Sergeant Otley here?
- Yeah, governor, he's upstairs.
SHEFFORD:
Jonesy.
Are you the owner of the lease of the house?
WOMAN:
I just pushed the door open.
I pushed the door open.
The light was on.
You all right, gov?
I'm going to check downstairs.
Oh, good boy, Frank.
WOMAN:
...couldn't look at her again.
JONES:
Have you had a cup of tea?
Shefford.
Who found her?
She's a hell of a mess.
Look, I tried to contact you.
Here.
Look, I told you I were down at the club, having a few.
- What's that?
- [ Indistinct conversations ]
WOMAN:
I just pushed the door.
MAN:
Yeah, they're all rented.
Thanks, Bill.
Right.
Let's get to work.
Change in here?
NORMAN:
No blood on the floor, so she probably wasn't killed here.
I'm gonna take her temperature.
MAN:
Obvious head injuries, possibly penetrating through clothing.
Well, the room's damn cold, about 5 degrees now, say 2 to 3 when she was found.
Window half open.
The curtains not drawn.
No source of heating.
Door to landing open.
Nasty breeze coming up the stairs.
[ Man speaking indistinctly ]
Deep rectal temperature at, uh, 2:12 a.m.
is 35.8 degrees.
Assuming it was at 37, that would put it back to, uh, around midnight.
Okay, okay, lads.
Mortuary.
John, you want a look?
She's been dead maybe an hour.
I'd say two at the most.
SHEFFORD:
Can you give us anything on the weapon?
Let me get her down to the mortuary.
I've left the rope on.
I didn't want to cut it.
Was she raped?
I don't know.
Have you got an I.D. on her?
Yes.
Lucky you.
Della Mornay, prostitute.
[ Soft rock music playing ]
Where's that sodding music coming from?
Nobody had seen her for weeks.
The landlady only went in because she owed rent.
Saw the lights on.
SHEFFORD:
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
♪ Happy birthday, dear Joshua ♪
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪
Good lads.
What else?
A train set, yes, and?
No, no, son, I can't come home right now.
But I promise you I won't miss your birthday party tomorrow.
Put your mother on, then.
Look, love, I'm sorry about this.
I'll be back as soon as I can.
I got to go.
Oh, got your frocks on.
Good.
Well, come on.
Rope's tagged on the side there.
It's nothing special, as far as I can see, but you can get it over to Willy.
Okay, she died, not approximately, exactly 12:15.
Her watch stopped.
[ Chuckles ]
No kidding.
Probably when the rope was tied.
She didn't put up much of a struggle.
There's nothing underneath her nails, and her hands have been scrubbed, by the look of them.
This is interesting.
See?
A nasty little nick here, right just above the palm.
Come on.
Come on.
What about a weapon?
Um, a long, thin, bladed instrument.
It could, um, oh, a sharpened screwdriver.
Clean entry wounds, in some areas up to six inches deep.
And look here.
Both arms the same.
Heavy bruising to the upper part, like she'd been put in some kind of a clamp.
Her whole body's badly bruised, and extensive bruising to the vagina.
Want to see?
I reckon she's got semen in virtually every orifice.
Sent swabs over to the labs for testing about, oh, five hours ago.
If they're positive, you could have the guy's blood group by this afternoon.
Right.
Let's get started.
[ Camera shutter clicks ]
Oh, yes, this will narrow the field.
Look what we've got here.
Rare blood group, A.B. secretor.
75% of 3.2%, isn't it?
Right, if we've got an A.B. secretor, that means... 2.4%.
Right.
Let's see.
2 plus 2 minus this 2%, so we take 2% of 2.4%.
That's 0.04%.
One person in 2,500.
We're narrowing the field even further.
- Where are you going?
- Computer.
We had some rare blood groups recorded when we were starting up the database.
I'll have them check this one out.
[ Laughing ] Are you kidding me or what?
Right.
Well, it's straight back to base.
You're never going to believe this.
We've only got a frigging suspect.
Our man's got a rare blood group, but he's only on the bloody computer.
[ Laughs ]
Guess what, girls!
Paxman's record is set to be wiped!
[ Indistinct talking ]
Sorry, ma'am.
What was all that about?
It's been going on for years.
Paxman, whoever he was, has a record, from finding the victim to charging the murder suspect in 36 hours.
"G" for "gotcha" -- George Arthur Marlow, released nine months ago from Durham.
You got an address on him, Jonesy?
Yeah, Sarge.
Look at this.
Excuse me, ma'am.
Arrested and charged with attempted rape, aggravated burglary.
He served two sentences.
Yeah, yeah, we got that, you dumb bastard.
You got Kilburn down there.
High Grove Estate?
- Uh...
- Check it out.
- Yeah.
- Good, good, good.
What's the time?
5 to 11:00.
Right.
You reckon he'll be there, gov?
Yes, unless he's gone on holiday.
Excuse me.
We're gonna break Paxman's record.
Go, go, go!
[ Laughter ]
You bugger.
SHEFFORD:
Right, come on!
Move it!
[ Tires screech ]
[ Telephone ringing ]
D.C.I. Tennison.
Uh, no.
No, I'm sorry.
I'm in court all afternoon.
Try Shefford's office.
It's extension 435.
It's all right.
It's no problem.
You wanted something done before the court session?
Only the Xerox is on the blink again.
No, no.
Uh, what time did that call come in, that case Shefford's on?
Only I was on standby all last night.
I think they fished him out of a club about 2:00.
It was a prostitute.
Mulner Road.
He's gloating.
They've got a suspect already.
If they can charge him, be drinks all 'round tonight.
[ Tires screech ]
[ Car door closes ]
BURKIN:
Skipper, at the window we got a male, dark hair.
He's definitely inside.
There's a woman with him.
Repeat, one male, one female.
[ Dog barking in distance ]
Ah!
All right, Jones.
Open up!
It's the police!
MAN:
I think they sussed us, gov.
He's looking down at us in the car.
Come on.
Open the bloody door.
We've got a warrant.
Come on!
Police!
What do you want?
All right, love, this is a warrant.
I'm Detective Chief Inspector John Shefford, and I've got three officers with me.
Now, look at my I.D.
Open the door.
[ Locks rattling ]
- George Marlow?
- Yes.
- Caution him.
Cuff him.
- What's this all about?
- I'm Detective Sergeant...
- M-Moyra?
Get your hands up.
What?
What?
[ Indistinct talking ]
Do you understand me?
- Understand?
- Yes, sir.
HENSON:
You can't just walk in here and take things.
This is private property.
We got rights.
MAN:
One for you, as well, miss.
Moyra?
Yes, I'm all right.
I'm right behind you, love.
Excuse me.
Sorry.
HENSON:
How long is all this going to take?
Only I've got a 5:00 appointment this afternoon.
[ Sighs ]
Look, I understand the caution.
I understand you're taking us down, but you haven't told me what we're supposed to have done.
Ohh.
We're in room 4D.
I've just -
- Come on.
Let's get a move on.
My lad's rushed over to Willy with one of Marlow's shirts.
We got a bloodstain on the cuff.
That's the good news.
Bad news is it's the size of a pinprick.
Well, if it matches our girl, we've got the bastard.
We'll have enough to charge him.
Put it there.
Hey!
Right.
It's Joshua's birthday tomorrow, your godson, Otters.
We'll make it a double celebration, right?
Come on.
SHEFFORD:
Right, his girlfriend states he was at home the time Della Mornay was murdered.
She's a tough bitch and won't be budged.
Plus, that lawyer got her out of here faster than a fart.
Well, I don't know how that Paxman did it.
We're not gonna break the record at this rate, are we?
Oi, Sherlock, come here.
We found his car yet?
No, it's not on the estate.
Nobody's seen it.
His girlfriend said it was there when we were at the flat this morning.
I got everyone I can trying to trace it.
Good lad.
Let's have Marlow up again, shall we?
Right, gov.
Cheese and pickle, please, Jonesy.
You take them.
I'll get Marlow.
SHEFFORD:
Joshua, what are you doing up at this time of night?
Put your mother on.
What do you mean she's in the bath?
Get her out the bath.
Hold on.
What's happening?
Three times I've asked for sausage and got bleeding salad.
All right, George.
Just tell it to me one more time.
I was driving along.
And I saw her.
But you didn't know her?
No, I've never met her.
But she gives me the come-on.
So I picked her up.
And I asked her, "How much?"
And she said, "It depends."
Well, you know, they like to hustle as much out of you as they can.
Oh, yeah.
But you been done before, George.
You don't like hustles, do you?
Now, wait a minute.
She pisses you off, right?
Della Mornay pisses you off.
Right?
Della Mornay?
Yeah.
Della Mornay.
[ Parking brake clicks, engine shuts off ]
[ Car alarm activates ]
Hello?
I'm home!
Hi.
I've just taken the small lamp from the sideboard, put it by his bed.
He'll want it on all night.
[ Smooching ]
Ohh, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait.
Watch it.
I've got chocolate gateau in here, fish fingers.
I've got sausages.
I've got spaghetti hoops, and I've got potato alphabet.
He's only coming for one night.
Well, I want him to have a choice.
Anyway, the spaghetti hoops are for me.
[ Both chuckle ]
No, no, use the best china.
He's 6 years old.
Yeah, well, I want to make an impression, don't I?
I really appreciate this.
Mm.
Yeah, well, I appreciate how much you miss him.
Is she bringing her new husband?
She'd better not.
- [ Doorbell rings ]
- Oh, that's them!
Uh, quick, get the, um --
- Put the china on the --
- No, no, sorry.
- No, all right, go to the door.
- Yeah.
And it's all right.
I'll -
- I'll, uh --
I'll be right with you in a minute.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Come in.
Hi.
Hello, Daddy.
- Hello.
How are you?
- Oh, shit!
PETER:
Here's -
- Here's Christopher.
How is he?
Is he in good spirits?
- TENNISON:
Ohh.
- Oh, hi.
Um, Marianne, this is Jane Tennison.
- Hello.
- Jane.
- How do you do?
- Pleased to meet you.
And you must be Joe.
What's that?
Oh, it's chocolate.
Mmm!
Yum!
Would you like some?
Come with me to the kitchen, then.
So, you be a good boy, and Mommy will come and see you tomorrow.
[ Smooches ] All right?
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.
MARIANNE:
Right, I'll see you tomorrow, then.
- Yes, yes.
- And thank --
- Jane.
Jane.
- Jane.
Yes, well, have a nice evening.
Um, look, uh, as I'm now more settled, um, I'd like to have Joey more regularly.
Yes.
Well, we'll see how it works out.
I'm pregnant.
TENNISON:
What would you like to drink?
- Oh.
- JOEY:
Water, please.
Congratulations.
Right.
I'll see you tomorrow about 10:00, then.
Yeah.
She's not what I expected.
I don't know.
I suppose I thought she'd be in uniform.
TENNISON:
Don't get that chocolate all over your face.
- MARIANNE:
See you.
- Yeah.
TENNISON:
Should have worn a flat hat for her.
Oh, she wasn't what I expected, either.
She's very beautiful, very groomed.
Oh, look, I'm sorry.
I-I suppose I blew it.
No.
No, how could you?
You're beautiful, talented, and, uh, covered in chocolate.
[ Laughs ]
Oh, more, more, more.
More!
Look at you!
You're covered in chocolate, too!
Forensics are still having a problem putting our man in that bed-sit, but I say we go for it.
We got enough to charge him.
So, if we push Willy for that blood sample and he comes up with it this afternoon, ba-boom.
And I got Joshua a train set.
Is that what he wanted?
I hope so 'cause that's what I've got him.
Ohh.
Why didn't you tell me?
- Morning.
- Morning.
Look, gov, Marlow admits he knew the victim.
When do you think Felix will have all the p.m. results?
They'll be through this morning.
Plus, we've got a blood sample from Marlow's shirt
- with forensic, right?
- No witness.
I know I've got no witness, but I've got enough to charge him.
John, you've got no witness seeing Marlow enter the bed-sit.
So what?
Ohh, shit.
Ohh.
- You all right?
- Shit.
Ugh, got a cramp.
John?
Get an ambulance.
Get an ambulance!
[ Voice breaking ] John?
John?
This is D.C.S. Kernan.
Get an ambulance to the station immediately.
It's urgent.
And also get Alan Smith...
[ Crying ] No, please, John.
You steal £500,000 from old-age pensioners, what do you get?
Six months.
Is he going to be all right?
[ Indistinct talking ]
MAN:
Sooner we get him to hospital, the better.
HAVERS:
Jesus Christ.
I can't believe it.
He was laughing and joking when he came in.
Said he'd be in the pub tonight.
[ Indistinct conversations ]
He didn't make it.
He was dead on arrival.
Christ.
It's his son's birthday party.
[ Telephone ringing ]
[ Indistinct conversations ]
I don't believe it.
Incident Room.
Yes, I'm still here.
MAN:
Yes, all right, all right.
Hang on, hang on.
Calm down.
Well, I mean, I told you that's all we can do...
Can you give us a description?
Yeah?
About what time was it?
All right, then.
Height?
Yeah.
[ Exhales heavily ]
KERNAN:
Come in.
Hello, Jane.
This may not be the right time, sir, but under the circumstances,
I'm not quite sure when would be the right time.
I'm offering to take over the murder investigation.
I don't have to tell you that I am qualified to handle this investigation and that I have been waiting for --
[ Sighs ]
Well, I don't have to tell you how long.
18 months.
And in that time,
I've had to handle more paperwork than I did at Reading for my whole five years dealing with sex cases.
I know D.C.I. Shefford was at a crucial stage of the investigation.
Inspector, I have to see his wife this afternoon.
Don't expect me to make any decisions now.
This is not the right time.
Well, when is the right time?
Look, I am the only officer of my rank who is continually overstepped, sidestepped, whatever.
Just give me the chance to prove that I can do it.
You don't have to prove yourself to me.
Let me think about it.
Well, that's not enough, Michael.
I'm getting sick to death of this so-called Metropolitan Police survey being thrown at me.
So, all right, apparently, 90% of the time, the general public would prefer a male officer.
But until one of us gets the chance to prove that that survey is a biased, outdated load of old bullshit --
A close friend, a man who I respected highly, died right there.
And now, Inspector, is not the time to thrust your women's rights down my throat.
I'll get back to you.
Thank you, sir.
[ Door closes ]
Get me the rota on all the D.C.I.s on our AMIT list.
Also, call D.C.I. Kinlock at Notting Hill.
See who he's got available.
- Hello, gov.
- Andy.
- Hello, Joan.
- Hello.
The commander's expecting you.
Do you know how the men feel about having a woman heading a murder squad?
It's a question of opening the floodgates.
Give her this case, she'll expect more.
There's a few of her rank coming up.
I just don't think I want to take the responsibility.
Once she's in, be tough getting her off.
Then the media might get hold of it.
Yeah.
I've just had a word with her old chief on the Flying Squad.
She took a lot of punishment.
And he reckons she deserves a break.
Female murder squad officer.
Are you prepared to take the risk?
Oh, I see.
The ball's in my court, is it?
Flying Squad reckons she's got them.
What?
Balls.
JONES:
I heard we'll get Kelvin.
He's an okay bloke.
Haskons was with him at Reading.
He's a teetotaler, isn't he?
Or what about that red-haired D.C.I.?
You know.
He was on that Shepherds Bush shooting.
What was his name?
Hickock, yeah.
He's supposed to be a good bloke.
He used to be a friend of John's, apparently.
After John going, it's gonna be hard for any bastard to take over.
Not that we need anyone.
John was about to charge Marlow.
Bill, get the lads down to the Incident Room, can you?
[ Sighs ]
Yeah.
This case is being taken over by D.C.I. Tennison.
And full charges will be assessed and determined by her.
I want you all to give her every assistance in familiarizing herself with the case to date.
Uh, I think, sir, that --
Well, me and the lads feel that an outsider --
Well, another officer coming in at this stage of the proceedings, well, it's not necessary.
If we're gonna have someone, how about the bloke from Reading?
We don't need anybody else.
KERNAN:
...of Tennison taking over but of bringing the case to court.
The quicker that's done, the better.
We should have the right as a team to choose who --
Shut it, all of you!
Now, I know how you must all feel.
But give her the best you've got.
[ Indistinct conversations ]
I'll give that tart the best I've got, all right.
We don't want her.
We don't need her.
[ Knock on door ]
These are the Della Mornay records from Vice.
The reason or excuse they've been so long in coming --
Chief Shefford also requested them -- is that Kings Cross Vice Squad are changing over their system.
Their old machines are not compatible with the latest at Scotland Yard.
TENNISON:
Get ahold of Felix Norman for me.
Say I want to view the victim tonight.
So, I'll need a squad car and a driver, and I want access to all items taken from the victim's bed-sitter, and I want to re-interview the landlady.
And also, get the dabs guys to send me over a set of prints from the victim and also a set of prints from this file, which don't seem to be there, with any discrepancies marked.
We've got a set of prints.
No, I want two sets, one from the victim and one from Della Mornay's original Vice file.
Got that?
I'll see you in the item checkout room.
- Right.
- [ Door closes ]
WOMAN:
One pair of stockings.
WOMAN #2:
Check.
One pair of briefs.
Check.
Where are the rest of Della Mornay's clothes?
At the other end, ma'am.
One pair of shoes.
- Size?
- 7.
Yeah.
One pair of large men's trousers.
No, I haven't got those here.
One pair of...
Ma'am, D.C. Jones is waiting.
Where's Sergeant Otley?
I don't know.
He was with the super.
WOMAN:
Another pair of trousers, white.
I want John Shefford's team, all of them, in the Incident Room tomorrow morning at 9:00 sharp.
And get these bagged up for me, would you?
[ Engine turns over ]
NORMAN:
She has severe facial bruising, blood around her nostrils and matted in her hair, traces of semen in her mouth and ears.
One eardrum perforated by a blow on the side of the head, here.
What about that cut that Marlow mentioned in his statement?
On the right wrist, just above the palm.
- Can I see that?
- Mm.
Small but quite deep.
Would have caused considerable bleeding.
Think she could have been strung up and then cut down and her hands tied behind her back?
I'll have to do body testing with that.
I'm a bit pressed for time.
Excuse me.
Where's the toilet?
Oh, you feeling a bit queasy?
No, but I think he is.
Oh, it's out there, to the right.
TENNISON:
Could I have a look at her feet, please?
NORMAN:
Her feet?
Oh, certainly.
TENNISON:
What size do you think they are?
Oh, lovely, thanks.
Listen, I won't be long.
No, no, take as long as you need.
Oh, did you hear about that job, that contract?
Oh, tomorrow, I hope.
Listen, uh, with Marianne being pregnant --
You know, I worked her out.
I reckon it's because she's pregnant that she's letting Joe stay all of a sudden.
And, yes, of course he can.
He can come as long as he likes, whenever.
See?
Sherlock Holmes.
Good morning.
Like everyone else in this room,
I am saddened and deeply shocked by this tragedy.
John Shefford was a well-liked and highly respected officer.
And I am not attempting to step into his shoes.
No one could.
But as the first available D.C.I.,
I am taking over this investigation.
All I ask of you is your undivided loyalty and attention.
Does anyone have anything to say?
I do.
Look, I know you asked for this case specifically.
You don't like it, put in for a transfer, and it will be dealt with via the normal channels.
MAN:
She thinks she's tasty.
Anyone else?
Right.
On the right is Della Mornay.
On the left is the murder victim.
These are the prints taken from the corpse, and these are the prints from Vice records of Della Mornay.
[ Men murmuring ]
As you can see, we have wrongly identified the victim.
Which makes the statement made by our suspect, George Marlow, a statement in which he names Della Mornay as the girl he picked up, incorrect.
If that statement was to be used in a court of law,
George Marlow would be released.
So, uh, how did he come by that name?
The main interrogation officer --
You know who it was, and what is this?
You after destroying John's reputation before he's in his grave?
John Shefford was the main interrogation officer, and, yes, he did misidentify the victim.
But the landlady also misidentified the victim.
Now, I-I don't want to waste any more time.
I want that landlady re-interviewed and all the tenants.
We have to find Della Mornay and get an I.D. on that body.
I want the labels on the clothes checked out because they are expensive, boutique type of clothes, not the line of garment worn by Della Mornay.
And also, the shoes.
Her shoes are a size 5.
Well, our victim is a size 61/2.
I want all Della's associates, the Vice girls, brought in and re-interviewed and recorded, please.
We must find out where Della Mornay was last seen, where she is now.
So, we have to move like hell.
Either we go before the magistrate and ask for the three-day laydown -- right now, we'd never even smell it -- or George Marlow is gonna be released.
Top priority is his car, the brown Rover.
Has anyone got anything on that?
- No.
- TENNISON:
No?
Well, step up on that, then.
Okay, that's it.
- Thank you.
- [ Indistinct conversations ]
[ P.A. dings ]
WOMAN:
Will Sergeant Wilde please report to the Incident Room?
[ Exhales heavily ]
Sergeant Wilde to the Incident Room, please.
[ Indistinct conversation ]
That tart's gunning for John.
Well, let her try it.
She bad-mouths him, I'll make sure her knickers get screwed off her skinny dyke ass.
You don't think she is one, do you?
Do me a favor.
What bloke would fancy that?
[ Telephone ringing ]
[ Imitating Tennison ] You found Marlow's car yet?
No?
Then step on it.
Slit-assed tart.
Otley, Incident Room.
No, she's not.
[ Knock on door ]
You got a minute, ma'am?
Labs came through.
That spot of blood on his shirt is the victim's.
Good.
I thought you'd want to know.
Now, can they place him in that bed-sit?
Nothing else came through.
[ Sighs ]
Well, that's -- that's not enough.
MARLOW:
Stopped off at the bank, the one along Madley Road.
How much more does she need to know, for Christ's sake?
He told me.
He said it was a tart by the name of --
Who exactly told you the girl's name?
Inspector Shefford.
He's dead, isn't he?
I'm sorry.
He was a nice bloke.
Go on, George.
How did you meet her?
Well, I swear she was giving me the come-on.
I watched her.
She was bobbing down, peering into a few cars up ahead, so I stopped.
I asked --
I, uh, asked her, "How much?"
And she s--
Do you want me to tell you exactly what she said?
Yes.
She said that for a blow job --
[ Clears throat ]
She said that masturbation would cost £15 but that full sex would be more -- £25.
Look, whatever I say doesn't make me look good.
I don't even know why I wanted to do it.
George.
George, just tell me what happened.
I know, but I must have been crazy, especially after what happened up north.
But I paid for that.
I was drunk, and I swear -- I swear to you --
I'm not here to question you about any other incident.
I know.
I know.
It's just that everything I say makes me look as if I hurt that girl.
And I didn't.
I didn't.
[ Sobs ]
Moyra, my wife, what this will do to her, I don't know.
So, you picked her up.
So, what happened then?
[ Sniffles ]
Well, she gets into the car.
And we drive along under the bridge... to a big area of wasteland.
And she climbs from the front seat into the backseat, and w-we do -- we do the business.
And then she climbs from the backseat into the front again and she -- [ Chuckles ]
She catches her hand.
Uh...
You -
- You did say she cut her hand.
Yeah, cut, cut.
Now, which hand was that?
Uh...
Just, uh -- Oh, it was her right hand.
Yeah, it was her right hand because the radio is between the seats and it's got a sharp edge.
You can take the radio out.
It's portable.
Around where I live, a lot of radios get nicked out of cars.
Have you found the car yet?
Yeah, so, she -- she cut her hand.
It was just a nick, but it was bleeding.
So, I wrapped it with my handkerchief.
It's got my initial on it.
"G."
[ Sighs ]
[ Sniffles ]
Uh...
Then what happened?
I gave her the money.
I'd just been to one of those cash machines.
Well, you can check that out.
I asked her where she wanted to be dropped off, and she said the tube station.
[ Sighs ]
The last I saw of her was she was picking up another punter.
- [ Door opens ]
- It was a --
It was a red car.
Uh...
It could have been a Scirocco.
I'm not sure.
I didn't kill her.
I'll take any test you like.
I didn't do it.
[ Whispers indistinctly ]
TENNISON:
Five minutes.
[ Footsteps depart ]
[ Door opens ]
I went home, got there about half past 10:00, maybe a quarter to 11:00, maybe a bit later.
TENNISON:
So, had you picked her up before?
No.
I told you.
I'd never seen her before.
[ Indistinct conversations ]
OTLEY:
Where is that bloody woman?
She's downstairs in the cell with Marlow.
I got girls coming in from all over.
That'll keep her busy.
TENNISON:
Is there anything on Marlow's car yet?
OTLEY:
No, not yet.
Oh, and there's a --
There's a roomful of girls waiting for you.
What?
Known associates of Della Mornay.
You asked for them to be brought in, and they're coming in by the carload.
I presumed you'd want to interview them personally, ma'am.
There were 17 at the last count.
Well, I don't have the time right now, so why don't you take a statement from each of them and put them on my desk?
- Are these the missing girls?
- OTLEY:
Yeah.
It's got "Missing Persons Report" on the top, hasn't it?
Cut it out, Sergeant.
One in Surrey, one in Cornwall Gardens look promising.
Ah, okay, you want me to deal with those?
Why not?
I'll have my hands full.
I've got a roomful of slags to interview.
Yeah, well, you should have staggered them, shouldn't you?
Listen, can you check if there's been a handkerchief found?
Yes, ma'am.
Yeah?
Yes, speaking.
Only Marlow said he wrapped the victim's hand in it.
He doesn't know what happened to it.
Yeah, okay, could you, uh --
Yeah, put him through.
OTLEY:
Tony.
What's this?
It's a search warrant for Moyra Henson's flat.
She knows we've only got 10 hours before that bastard has to be released.
- What's going on?
- Well, I don't know.
I don't know what she's up to.
Ma'am, here's the search warrant, Moyra Henson's flat.
Yeah.
Look, can I call you back later?
I'm sorry.
All right?
It's important.
Bye.
- Anything on the handkerchief?
- JONES:
No, ma'am.
Okay, Sergeant, I'll be at the suspect's flat, and then I'll do the missing girls.
Frank, you're with me.
[ Indistinct conversations ]
I don't believe this.
Oi!
Tell her there's a dog missing from Battersea!
Big case she might put in for!
Owner got hit by a truck!
- She likes dead men's shoes.
- All right, gov, she's not deaf.
Am I the last one to know what's going down?
Hey, here, she just got a private call.
Grab that W.P.C. Havers.
See who she's knocking off.
If she's spreading the dirt on thick, we keep this to the ground.
Whatever you get on her, feed it back, all right?
I knew a bloke on the Flying Squad with her.
I'll give him a bell.
Well, Cornwall Gardens should keep her busy.
- [ Laughter ]
- So will Moyra Henson.
[ Laughter ]
- Where's your bathroom?
- HENSON:
This is harassment.
You've already been here two days on the trot.
What are you looking for this time?
I've got an appointment to keep, you know.
How long are you going to be this time?
And you can put that laundry back, sonny, unless you're a perverted crotch sniffer.
Those are my dirty knickers.
And I know how many there are.
How do you feel about your boyfriend picking up prostitutes?
I love it.
It gives me a night's rest.
I understand you stood by him when he was sent down for attempted rape.
She asked for it.
She was coming on to him, and he'd had too much to drink.
So, was he drunk when he came home --
He was not drunk.
He was in here by 10:30.
We watched television.
Then we went to bed.
I've said all this before!
What did they send you for?
The female touch, is it?
Soften me up?
You're pushing your luck, lady.
I'm going to lodge a formal complaint to whoever's in charge.
You've got no right --
I have every right, Miss Henson.
I'm now in charge of this investigation.
This is a photograph of the girl that George has admitted to picking up, admitted having sex with in his car.
Would you take a look, please?
What am I supposed to do, fall apart?
- BURKIN:
It's not here.
- I feel sorry for that girl.
But all George is guilty of is having sex with her.
You know, sex?
Now, why don't you just finish what you've got to do and get out?
Well, what do you think?
About what, sir?
My voice suddenly got lower, has it?
Maybe my knickers are too tight.
Listen, I like to be called governor or the boss.
I don't like "ma'am."
I'm not the bloody queen, so take your pick.
Yes, ma'am.
[ Sighs ]
Let's go and check on those missing girls.
Anything you say, but it's well after 2:00.
What's that supposed to mean?
You want lunch?
Nope, I'm just counting the hours to George Marlow's release.
Thanks.
I said I wanted brown.
[ Sighs ]
- Anything come in for me?
- Nope.
How'd the interview go?
Edie Williams is a 35-year-old with a history of mental disorder and a passion for watching trains at Euston station.
Now, either Sergeant Otley needs his frigging head seen to or he's sending me on a wild goose chase 'round London.
She didn't even fit the description.
Next one better be legit.
So, what we got?
Karen Howard reported missing from Kensington.
Well, what the hell are we doing out here in Surrey?
Oh, I see.
It's her parents' place.
That bastard Otley.
It's another waste of time.
I know it.
Yes, can I help you?
Good afternoon.
I'm Detective Chief Inspector Tennison, and this is Detective Inspector Burkin.
Hello.
Could we speak with Major Howard, please?
Um, come this way.
Thank you.
I'll tell Major Howard you are here.
Thank you.
We've found her.
Yeah, that's her.
We're ready for you now.
TENNISON:
Is this your daughter Karen?
[ Voice breaking ] Yes.
She's my daughter.
TENNISON:
Thank you, sir.
Do you take sugar, sir?
No, no, no, I don't.
I should call my wife.
Yes, we'll arrange for a car to take you home as soon as possible.
Inspector?
What happened?
Sir, wouldn't you prefer to be at home with your wife?
We can question you another time.
Question me?
I want to know who's in charge here.
I want to know exactly what is happening.
Who is in charge of this investigation?
- My daughter --
- I am, sir.
I'm in charge of the murder investigation.
What?
Well, I want -- I have a right.
I have every right to meet whoever it is.
I am a personal friend of Chief Constable Andrew Gurnham.
I want to see him, and I want to see him now.
Deputy Chief Gurnham is with another department, sir.
He's with the Ministry of Defence Police.
However, if you prefer, I can arrange for an appointment --
You won't arrange any bloody appointment.
I want him here right now.
Understand?
I don't want a woman.
Now will you please call him?
As I said, sir, I can arrange an appointment.
Just get out and leave him alone.
Jesus Christ.
Let the man cry.
He's heartbroken.
[ Door closes ]
Mnh.
Look, I'm sorry I had a go in there, but I could see the old boy was upset, and, uh --
Well, I'm sorry.
That's all right.
It's no problem.
Anyway, I think he's ready to go home now.
Oh, Sergeant Otley needs you over at H.Q.
Oh, when did that call come in?
It came in when you was over at Cornwall Gardens.
I see.
Karen's boyfriend's been brought in for questioning.
In future, I want all information to be passed to me directly, no matter what the circumstances.
[ Exhales sharply ]
Now, is there anything else?
No.
[ Exhales ]
Sergeant Otley's stirring it up, is he?
Next thing I know, he'll be asking for a vote of no confidence.
Oh, I see.
Well, I'd better get on over there.
You stay here and deal with the major.
And thank you, Burkin.
Sheila, will you just concentrate for a second, love?
Then you can go.
Did you ever see any of these men pick up Della Mornay?
- No.
- Can I have the photos?
I've only just got them.
Can you just wait?
- Before Christmas.
- Before Christmas, right.
- How long before?
- I don't know.
I've interviewed six of them.
None of them have seen her.
This girl says she's got a cold and she wants to go home.
- Can I clear her?
- No, you can't.
I've been here four hours already!
Just be quiet, will you?
We'll let you when we're ready, all right?
[ Indistinct conversations ]
Which one of you is Mavis Fellow?
- I am.
- Sit down there.
Now, you said in your statement you last saw Della Mornay two months ago.
The situation is out of control.
Look for yourself.
Look, none of these girls have seen Della Mornay for weeks.
No positive I.D. on the victim.
Well, not as far as I've been told, officially.
Ma'am's been down in the morgue.
Look, I've got the entire team down here wasting time.
We don't know if she's gonna charge him or not, governor.
It's a mess.
How much more evidence does she need?
Get these women out of the corridor.
- [ Banging ]
- Oi!
Cut that out!
[ Laughter ]
Has anyone got anything on Marlow's car yet?
Not yet, ma'am, but we got you a spot on "Crime Night."
[ Laughter ]
That's a good idea.
I was joking.
Yeah, I'm not, but keep on laughing.
Only time's running out.
We've got Marlow's lawyer pacing around downstairs.
Get on to the press office.
MUDDYMAN:
Did you get anything at Marlow's flat, ma'am?
No, just a lot of flak from his girlfriend.
Where the hell is Sergeant Otley?
LILLIE:
Oh, yeah, records sent this in.
It's about Moyra Henson.
She was picked up for soliciting 15 years ago.
I don't know if that's any use.
She's been on the dole for four years.
Could be interesting.
We got 24 toms' statements, and there's more waiting downstairs.
What do you want to do?
Uh...
Super's with Marlow's lawyer.
We gonna charge him?
Running out of time, ma'am.
Yes, I am aware of that, Sergeant.
Right, I'll deal with the girls first.
Just wait here till I'm through.
Until you're through, yes, ma'am.
Tony, you got a list of the girls' names?
We're going to need a female P.C.
Oh, and formal identification of the victim is on my desk.
- Her name is Karen Howard.
- Karen Howard.
We know.
I got her boyfriend and her flatmates waiting upstairs.
Yeah, extension 242, please.
Press office.
Right, well, uh, I'll, um --
I'll interview the boyfriend first, then.
[ Telephone ringing ]
She's gone off you, lovey.
This time tomorrow, Hickock's in, she's out.
Money on it.
I don't know.
Governor would have had him charged and banged up by now.
That bitch is scared stiff.
That's our problem.
Yeah, is that the press office?
Yeah, it's the main Incident Room, Burkin here.
I want to fix up a "Crime Night" for the Howard case.
Tennison.
[ Indistinct conversation ]
[ Sighs ]
[ Elevator doors close ]
[ Elevator doors open ]
Now, the reason you said you had not seen Karen for a while was because you'd had a row.
Is that right?
We agreed not to see each other so much.
God, I can't believe she's dead.
I can't believe it.
She was murdered, Michael.
She was found in a prostitute's bed-sitter.
Now, I want you to look at this photograph and tell me, have you ever seen Karen with this man?
Have you ever seen this man?
Look at the photograph, Michael.
No, I've never seen him.
Did Karen take drugs?
No, she didn't even drink.
Did you have a full relationship with her?
Sex, Michael.
Did you have sex together?
Yes, of course.
So, when you said that she wanted to cool it, did that mean that she had other boyfriends?
No.
So, she didn't sleep around?
Michael, I know this is hard for you.
It's hard for us, but we have to find out why she was in that bed-sitter, how she got into a prostitute's bed-sit.
Now, look at me, Michael.
Look at me.
Did Karen ever pick up men, men she didn't know?
No.
No!
No!
I think you better take him home.
Get him a car.
I'm sorry, Michael.
What sort of person are you?
Karen was a sweet, innocent girl.
You try to make her look dirty, make her out to be something that she wasn't.
You disgust me.
Any joy with Michael?
No.
Bill Otley reckons you've got enough to charge Marlow.
No, sir.
Okay.
[ Indistinct conversations ]
She's coming now.
Is the super with her?
They've got to charge Marlow, haven't they?
George Marlow is to be released tonight.
- [ Men murmuring ]
- Jesus Christ!
I'm sorry.
I know how you feel.
If you'll forgive me for saying so, ma'am, I don't think you do.
[ Indistinct talking ]
So, it's 9:00 tomorrow morning.
We'll review what went down today and we'll discuss how we proceed.
[ Indistinct conversations, telephone ringing ]
Otley, Incident Room.
Eh?
MARLOW:
Thank you, Arnold.
I think we've heard the last of it, George.
- Let's hope.
- All right.
- George Marlow.
- Yes, governor.
MARLOW:
Uh, just hang on a sec, will you?
[ Knock on window ]
Thank you.
I knew you'd get me off.
[ Horn honks ]
We got to get over to Sunningdale Golf Club.
We got another one.
Hands tied behind her back, slashed to pieces.
[ Police radio chatter ]
I've worked with Sergeant Eastel before.
He knew about our case, so he gave me a tip-off.
Man over there with the retriever found her, or his dog did.
Ugh!
Shit.
MAN:
Tango 3 to Hotel Bravo 2.
The waterproof clothing and extra lighting you requested is on its way.
Over and out.
Detective Sergeant Eastel, D.C.I. Tennison.
Has the pathologist got here yet?
On his way.
Anyone -
- Any idea how long she's been here?
Well, judging by the decomposition and the stench, a month, at least.
[ Camera shutter clicks ]
I'd like to have a look, please.
Are you sure?
It's not a pretty sight.
I want to see her face.
MAN:
Does anyone know if the clubhouse has been opened yet?
Anyone get in touch with Stewart?
And if it's there, ask if anyone's handled any female clothes in from the golf course.
The one nearest this one.
Stinks to high heaven.
Heat from the lamps is making it worse.
That's Della Mornay.
- You sure it's your girl?
- Yeah.
Any money on it, George Marlow did this, as well.
Knot's the same, hands tied behind her back.
Pity you released him.
You could have had him for three more days.
I'll have him back inside, and when I do, he's gonna stay inside.
No more loopholes this time.
Off the record, ma'am, okay?
We knew we had the right man.
We knew it.
Shit!
[ Metal clanks ]
[ Sighs ] Pencil.
There's never any bloody pencils.
[ Chuckles ] Hi.
Hello, Ebbs.
[ Door opens ]
Bugger it!
He's asleep, thank God.
[ Gasps ]
Oh, good night, darling.
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.
I mean, I --
[ Sighs ]
I hardly ever see you, and when I do, you're knackered.
I-I'm sorry.
I mean, what's the point?
Peter.
I love you.
You do?
Yes.
[ Sighs ]
And if the phone rings, I don't exist.
I don't know.
Every time I see you, you're buried in some files or... giving someone a bollocking on the phone.
You're right.
Oh, you're right, and I will make more time for us soon.
I promise.
And just to prove it...
[ Chuckles ]
What's the matter?
Can't you sleep?
No.
You have a bad dream?
Okay.
I'll tell you what we'll do.
We'll get you back into bed.
Uh, I'll get you some milk from the kitchen.
I'll read you another story, and then you can try to go to sleep, okay?
Okay.
Come on.
[ Sighs ]
Morning, Jonesy.
Morning, ma'am.
Hop in.
I'm going to the morgue.
[ Engine turns over ]
Got here early for breakfast.
NORMAN:
I've got the Reading postmortem here.
Dead approximately six or seven weeks.
Due to being out in the open air, or partly, the body is badly decomposed.
- Foxes have had a go at --
- Off the record, Felix.
And I know -- till you've had time to make your tests.
It's a different weapon, but a narrow, thin type of blade.
Now, she's been badly beaten, and her body is probably too decomposed to get semen samples.
But if you're trying to get me to say I think the same man killed both victims --
Off the record?
Well, off the record -- and don't quote me -
- I'd say yes, because she's got identical marks on the top of both arms.
Now can I get on with the postmortem?
JONES:
FN1 -- plucked head hair.
FN2 -- plucked pubic hair.
FN3 -- false nail, left hand.
FN4 --
Sorry.
Silly me.
FN4 -- false nail, right hand.
FN5 -- vagina swab for DNA, semen, and others.
[ Indistinct conversations ]
Perfect match.
Will you have a look?
Mm.
Fancy a cup of coffee?
Canteen's closed.
One single here and another double.
- And another double.
- Oh, Joyce?
[ Telephone ringing ]
WILLY:
Joyce!
Joyce, you're wanted in the main lab!
And which one of you bastards put this bloody shoe in my fridge?
So, Della was naked, hands tied behind her back, been dead six to seven weeks.
You'll get photos and the particulars as soon as possible.
Now, the rope used to tie her hands was not the same type as that used to tie Karen's,
- but the knot is.
- You can talk to me about it.
D.C. Oakhill.
Right.
43 Telegraph Hill...
So, Frank, what have you got?
Uh, well, Marlow visited his employers two, three times at Chester Paints, then the supermarket, cinema.
Hires a lot of videos.
So, was Marlow in London six or seven weeks ago?
Philip, aren't you onto his employers?
Uh, uh, yes, yes, he was.
He didn't leave London.
Good, okay, we've got Marlow in London for both Karen and Della's murders.
Now, have we got anything on Marlow's car?
No, of course not.
So, what about his neighbors?
You dealt with that?
My lads have interviewed the neighbors above, below, and both sides.
He's a well-liked bloke, uses his local pub regularly.
Again, everybody seems to like him.
TENNISON:
Okay, so, interview the householders, properties bordering on the golf course.
She wasn't killed where her body was dumped.
She was brought there.
so someone might have seen something.
Also, we've no weapon for either victim, so keep up the search on that.
Now, that's a thin weapon.
It's about 1/8 of an inch wide, about 7 inches long.
You in with me, Haskons?
Where's my fags?
You nicked my Bensons again?
[ Indistinct conversations ]
Karen's family have asked for the body to be released.
Did you arrange it when you were at the morgue this morning?
No.
Damn.
I forgot, but I'll get on to it.
Gab, gab, gab.
Right.
I want you both to take Sutherland Avenue, okay?
Take us, what, 20 minutes to get out there?
So, what about the press releases?
Did you hold off any mention of the wheals to the upper arms?
We kept it to the minimum until we've got something concrete to give them.
Your decision to release Marlow could backfire.
Oh, come on, sir.
You backed me up on that.
Have you had a change of mind?
Do you want to give us a minute?
Uh, no, I'd -
- I'd like him to stay, please, sir.
[ Clears throat ]
The consensus seems to be that this case is too heavy for you to handle.
- Oh, that's a load of bullshit.
- Let me finish.
TENNISON:
Excuse me, sir.
How well did John Shefford know Della Mornay?
He knew her.
No one ever denied that.
She was an informer.
So, you agree he knew her well, yes?
What's this got to do with anything?
Sir, when I took over this case,
I requested Della Mornay's file from Vice.
I was told that the delay in sending it was due to the computer changeover, leading me to believe that John Shefford had not had access to it, either.
But I was mistaken.
He did have it, but nothing in it was recorded in the case file.
It's a bloody waste of time, innit?
Is it?
Della Mornay was a police informer.
Not mentioned in the case file.
John Shefford was her arresting officer when he was attached to Vice.
Not recorded in the case file.
OTLEY:
Don't know anything about that.
But I do know that you've got a personal grudge against a man that was admired.
He was so bloody eager to make an arrest, desperate judging by this, chasing some stupid in-house record that even --
Are you talking about Paxman's record?
It was a joke.
There was no record.
It was John's.
He liked to gee up the lads.
Tell her.
I don't know where she's coming from.
It was a joke.
Sergeant, what I would like to know is, if you knew Della, if John Shefford knew Della well, why was that body wrongly identified?
They bloody look alike.
Her face was beaten to a pulp.
Now, why don't you leave it alone?
The man is dead!
So, uh... explain this...
Sergeant.
I found this in your desk, along with the original file from Vice.
What the hell is going on?
That's Della Mornay's personal diary.
Not tagged, not listed.
Pages torn out, pages obviously missing.
You wouldn't happen to know what was on those pages, would you?
Oh, yeah, I can explain that.
[ Clears throat ]
I gave it to John, and I presume...
I found it in his desk when I was clearing it out.
John must have torn the pages out.
Jesus Christ.
Do you know what this means?
You're accusing an officer of doctoring evidence.
Yes, I do know what it means, sir.
And I assure you if I discover any further irregularities --
KERNAN:
Any so-called irregularities, Inspector, you bring straight to me.
I will decide if I will take this matter further.
I'll let you know what I'm gonna do.
Until I have verification that both women were murdered by the same man,
I'd like to keep the discovery of Mornay's body under wraps.
Marlow still your main suspect?
Yes, and I'd like to keep him under pressure.
'Round-the-clock surveillance.
I know it's costly, but if he's killed twice...
And, uh, I'd like to handle the press releases from now on.
Check with you first, of course.
[ Door opens, closes ]
You bloody idiot.
She's wiping the floor with the lot of you.
You were lucky this time.
She let you off, not me.
Have you got those pages, Bill?
Yeah.
It's just -- just the days John went to see her.
It's nothing to do with the case.
He was fond of her.
He was very fond of her.
[ Door closes ]
[ Indistinct conversation ]
Just tailing our man returning from the factory.
He spent about an hour there.
He should be entering the flat any moment now.
- Over.
- [ Static hisses ]
HASKONS:
Okay, we have him.
Dropped his newspaper.
Most action we've seen all day.
Okay, he's getting his keys out now.
Oh, dear, oh, dear.
He can't get in.
Moyra.
Moyra, can you let me in?
HASKONS:
Old woman next door poking her nose in.
Moyra Henson at the door now.
[ Chuckles ]
This is it.
Watch her have a go at the nosy old cow next door.
He's been out.
Now he's back, all right?
Nosy old bitch.
I've got a feeling she's spotted us.
She's just shown us her tits.
[ Laughs ]
I don't suppose you got a shot of them, did you, you dozy bugger?
Cops have been in again.
This time they took the rest of your shoes.
I said they'd better bring them back.
Otherwise you'd be selling your paint in your stocking feet.
[ Lighter clicks ]
No, I won't.
I gave my notice in before they could give it to me.
Bastards.
You'd think we were spies, the way they're carrying on.
Oh, and put the chain on the door at night.
They had all our keys.
They could have made a set.
I don't trust one of them.
[ Sighs ] It's getting me down.
It's like we were prisoners.
I'm sorry.
Don't turn against me, please.
I love you, Moyra.
I walked right through the main factory floor.
Not one of them would look at me.
Young Ron Wilks -- Remember him?
I gave that lad his main contacts.
Turned his back on me.
None of them would look at me.
The law was there, asking questions.
They're everywhere.
I don't know how much more of this can take.
I have to take it, too, George.
And with you not earning, what are we gonna do?
I didn't do it.
I didn't do it.
So help me God, I didn't do it!
- [ Telephone ringing ] - [ Gasps ]
I'll get it.
It's those kids next door.
Yes?
Oh.
Hello, Doris.
Hang on.
It's your mom.
It's a pay phone.
Come on, love.
You've got to talk to her.
[ Sniffles ]
Hello, Mom!
Yeah, I'm fine.
How's your hip?
You are?
She says she's walking with one stick now.
[ Sniffles ]
Yeah, I know.
I'm sorry.
Yeah, they're -- they're talking to everyone that knows me.
[ Laughs ]
Thanks, Mom.
I wish the cops felt the same way.
Well, you know what they're like.
I will.
Yeah, everything's fine at work.
I will.
God bless.
You know I do.
[ Receiver clicks ]
[ Door closes ]
PETER:
Doesn't anybody give any messages in your place?
I booked a court.
I thought you wanted a game.
TENNISON:
Oh.
Oh, I'm sorry.
I forgot.
It's been a tough day.
Oh, it's okay.
Marianne phoned.
She wanted to know if we could have Joey for half a term.
Oh, yes, of course we can.
What's for dinner?
I'm starving.
Chicken Kiev.
I left a message on your bleeper for you to phone.
Ohh.
Um, listen, Thursday, Dad's birthday,
Mom's having a get-together.
Can you come?
- Yeah, that's fine.
- Good.
So, uh, what night can I invite Tom and Joyce and that guy King and his wife over for dinner?
King?
Who's King?
Well, I told you.
Frank King.
He's basically a property developer.
He's loaded, so Tom introduced us.
Well, you know, he's looking for a small building company to set up some sort of partnership.
Oh, that's interesting.
I mean, he could be really important to me.
So, I think we should get him over, give him the works.
You know, champagne, candles.
[ Telephone ringing ]
You could do your avocado thing.
Yeah, that's fine, no problem.
Tuesday.
Hello?
Jeff?
Did you swing it?
Ahh!
That's great!
Don't they ever give you a break?
God, they move fast.
Now -
- Yeah, but can they do a reconstruction?
Good, okay.
Yeah, I'll send the information over as soon as possible.
I mean, tonight, if they need it.
[ Exhales ] Yeah.
Yeah, that's really good news.
Thanks.
Thanks a lot, Jeff.
Bye.
We got any red wine?
Guess what.
I'm gonna be on television.
"Opportunity Knocks"?
[ Scoffs ] No.
"Crime Night."
I'm gonna be the first female D.C.I. on "Crime Night."
Oh, bugger!
It's Dad's birthday that night.
Well, can't they change the night?
Of course not!
It's live television!
I meant your father's birthday party.
[ Telephone dialing ]
[ Sighs ]
Everything's going to be all right.
Commander.
Thank you for coming, huh?
You are most welcome to join us back at the house.
- Thank you, sir.
- [ Engine turns over ]
I've got to get back.
And give it 15 minutes, and then get back to the station.
Right, I'll see you later.
Good luck with the boxing.
Good luck on the box.
[ Indistinct conversations ]
[ Engine turns over ]
MAN:
Gentlemen, may I have your attention, please?
Will you please make your way to your tables, gentlemen?
- Dinner is being served.
- Felix, what are you having?
I've got one!
I'll see you at the table!
Right!
So, two large GTs, large scotch, uh, la la la, orange juice.
Nothing for you till after the fight.
Don't worry.
That Lambton's a pushover.
Now, come on.
Get your skates on, love.
It's not what you've heard?
I'm just saying use your loaf, all right?
We're getting there.
We're getting there.
Gentlemen, I'm afraid the bar's closing now.
- Dinner is served.
- I'll be over later.
Got to watch that cow on "Crime Night."
Tenner on it she makes a cock-up.
Frank, best of luck.
Right, table 6.
Go over to table 6.
Jonesy, don't forget your drink.
[ Indistinct conversations ]
- Where's the corkscrew, Mom?
- It's over there, dear.
- Did you set the video?
- Yes.
Peter, will you check?
Yes, it's, uh -- it's on the wrong channel, Mr. Tennison.
It's on ITV.
This is BBC.
Tony, come on.
It's started.
Neil?
Could you switch the light off, Mom?
It's shining on the screen.
MAN:
What can you tell us, and, more importantly, what can we do to assist in the investigation into the murder of Karen Howard, the girl we can see on our screens now?
TENNISON:
Karen Howard's body was discovered in a bed-sitter on January the 15th this year.
Now, we know where Karen was up until 6:45 on the evening of January the 14th, but we've yet to discover her wherea--
What did you do that for?
I don't know what you want to watch it for.
Because there's somebody out there that can prove I'm innocent, that's why.
My God.
You don't believe me, either, do you?
Do you?
!
- You think I killed her!
- That's not true.
Well, then, for Christ's sake, watch it.
They've got a phone-in!
What if someone phones in and they saw the guy that picked her up, the same guy I saw?
What did you have to go and pick that girl up for?
You mean why did I have sex with her?
Because she was there.
Jesus!
Do you think I don't want to turn the clock back?
Do you think I don't wish that I'd never laid eyes on her?
Are you telling me that if I was to say to you there'd never be another woman in my life, that you'd believe it?
I love you.
I don't cheat on you.
I'm not like some guys, screwing their friends' wives.
What friends?
We don't have any left.
Look, somebody else killed her, Moyra, not me.
All I'm praying is that they find who did it and then they leave us alone.
MAN:
The bed-sit was in the Holborn area.
We can see on the screen at the moment the street and the house where she was discovered.
Could someone have taken Karen to this place by force?
TENNISON:
That is a possibility, but at this stage in the investigation, we can't say for sure.
MAN:
The 14th of January -- to help you recall that night -- the newspapers carried the story of Tandy, a fox terrier who'd been trapped in a manhole for more than three days.
Now, most of the newspapers carried a leading story and photograph of the recovery of Tandy.
The film you are about to see shows a reconstruction of Karen's last known movements after she left this building,
MacDonald's Advertising, and said goodbye to an executive she'd been to see.
It was 6:30.
Wearing clothes like these and carrying her portfolio, she walked towards her blue Mini, which she'd left parked in a side street under the Westway beyond these bottle banks.
Karen was 24, 5'8", with long, blond hair and blue eyes.
She looks like Karen.
...her portfolio into the passenger seat...
Not as pretty, though.
When she tried to start it, the battery was flat.
This witness said he saw Karen lock her car, leaving her portfolio behind.
He cannot recall if she had a handbag, but no handbag has been found, nor has her jacket.
Will Jane be on again, Daddy?
Listen to the program.
I think she might come on again after the film.
She'll be interviewed again.
No, I think that's it.
They now ask for witnesses to call in, and then -- then it stops.
Would you all shut up?
The witness who saw Karen try to make a call here also directed her towards a phone booth further along Ladbroke Grove.
PAM:
She was a pretty girl, wasn't she?
MRS. TENNISON:
That's not the real girl.
That's someone dressed up as her.
MR. TENNISON:
They couldn't have the real girl, woman, because she's dead.
When Karen reached it, she discovered it was a card phone.
Perhaps she didn't have a card.
She certainly never made the call.
What happened next?
The time is now approximately 6:45 p.m.
Did you go into this pub that night?
Did you see Karen Howard by this phone box on the corner of Lancaster Road?
And the wolves howled!
[ Crowd howling ]
And the dogs barked!
[ Crowd barking ]
And the door of the cottage slowly creaked open.
[ Imitates door creaking ]
And the old lady gestured pitifully to her granddaughter to come nearer.
[ High-pitched voice ] "Come closer, my little one.
Oh, what a big girl you've grown into.
Take off your red cape.
Oh ho ho ho ho!
Oh, what big boobies!"
[ Crowd murmuring ]
"Take off your wet dress.
Come and warm yourself by my fire."
[ Normal voice ] And very slowly,
Little Red Riding Hood...
So, listen, I want the keys.
Yeah, well, I'll give you them after.
- Well, don't forget.
- No, I won't!
Don't forget.
Jonesy!
Jonesy.
Oi, where's Otley?
He's watching ma'am on TV in the bar.
Well, get him in here!
Look, our man's on first!
All right?
[ Crowd groaning ]
MAN:
And as Little Red Riding Hood crept closer to the bed, the old lady threw up the bedclothes, and Red Riding Hood saw what a long...
- Toot de toot!
- Toot de toot!
And Red Riding Hood said --
[ High-pitched voice ] "Oh, Superintendent Kernan..."
[ Laughter, applause ]
"...it was Sergeant Otley last year, and all he did was caution me."
Oh ho ho!
[ Laughs ]
[ Cheers and applause ]
[ Normal voice ] Oh, thank you very much!
Thank you very much indeed, gentlemen!
Thank you.
In the blue corner, from Reading, Detective Sergeant...
TENNISON:
Her body was discovered...
Come on, Sarge.
Burkin's in the ring.
Somebody will have videoed this.
Come on.
She thinks she's Esther bloody Rantzen.
Yes.
Yes, it was a particularly brutal murder.
We need witnesses to come forward...
And now, gentlemen, you will have seen the blue buckets being passed around the table.
No, not for that reason, sir.
You use the one outside.
Now, those blue buckets,
I expect to see them filled to capacity, because you know this benefit is for Detective Chief Inspector John Shefford and his family.
So, for heaven's sake, fill the buckets!
We want your money!
Come on, Sa--
Her body was discovered...
OTLEY:
How did she swing that one, the bitch?
...in a place that she'd never been to before, so far as we can ascertain.
[ Indistinct shouting ]
KERNAN:
Sit down!
Sit down!
Sorry, gov!
Where's Otley?
He's in the bar watching ma'am on TV.
Come on, Frankie!
We've not found any trace of Karen Howard's handbag.
Also, we wish to trace a car which was seen in the area that night but has since disappeared.
Shown on the screen now is the type and color of the car.
It's a brown Rover P6, 3.5-liter automatic.
She get permission to give Marlow's registration number?
OTLEY:
Listen to her.
Who in the hell does she think she is?
And it's very important that we trace...
Did anyone get Marlow's permission?
MAN:
Did you see Karen that night?
Have you seen the missing car, a possible vital link in the killing?
Remember, your calls will be treated with confidentiality.
But if you did see Karen on the night of the 14th of January...
Your lad's in the ring for Shefford.
...637 4000.
Turn that bloody program off.
We simply ask for your help.
Turn it off.
TENNISON:
If you have any information that you can give us --
[ Indistinct shouting ]
How'd she get on, gov?
I reckon she cooked her goose!
- No.
Really?
- Really.
[ Laughs ]
HASKONS:
How'd she get on?
Oi, I'll take those.
MAN:
Take it away.
Round 3!

I made it.
Ohh.
[ Sighs ] Hi.
How was I?
Was I okay?
It was very good, love.
Oh, you were lovely, darling.
Are you going to have something to eat?
- Yeah.
- Have you eaten?
Give my daughter a glass.
It was good.
It was really good.
Hi, Tony.
The kids are in bed and asleep, are they?
- Oh, they're fine there.
- Mm-hmm.
Well, cheers, anyway.
It's all right, Officer.
I'm not driving tonight.
[ Chuckles ] Let me see it.
Oh, yeah, yeah.
So, did I look like I had too much makeup on?
Only I told them not to put so much on.
My hands were shaking.
I was so nervous.
Darling, it didn't show.
I didn't expect you home so soon.
I thought you might have to do the phone-in.
No, it's all right.
I got the lads dealing with that.
PAM:
Drink, yes, and I do the driving.
Is this the tape?
Um, I'll roll it on.
PAM:
You're going to do all the driving from then on.
I can tell you that here and now.
Mom, who set this tape up?
Well, don't look at me, dear.
Dad, you've recorded the bloody ice skating.
Shit!
It's all right.
I've recorded it at home.
No, I wanted to watch it, for Christ's sake.
[ Sighs ]
[ Beeping ]
That's my bleeper.
Where's my bleeper?
Where's my bleeper?
PETER:
Jane, just calm down.
TENNISON:
I've got to make a phone call.
Maybe you should blow out the candles.
TENNISON:
Maureen?
Yeah, I'm listening.
- I know...
- [ Blowing ]
I've got one here for Karen Howard.
Sounds like a goody.
She's on line 4.
Can someone take line 4 for me?
I can take it over here, Sandra.
WOMAN:
13th of January?
Yeah.
[ Indistinct conversations ]
Hello, yes?
Hello, uh, is that Helen Masters?
Hello, Ms. Masters.
Now, you say that you think you saw Karen Howard in Ladbroke Grove.
Is that right?
[ Siren wailing ]
[ Siren stops ]
[ Parking brake clicks ]
Helen Masters?
We're waiting for your calls.
All the lines are open.
The number is 071-637 4000.
It's up to you.
Call us.
We'll see you back here at 11:45.
[ Theme music playing ]
You were very good.
[ Chuckles ] Just a minute.
Oh, you're not gonna show it all again, are you?
Well, it's very important.
I mean, anything you do is important.
Anything anyone else does isn't.
Is that right?
I just want to watch a bit in the middle.
[ Sighs ]
I have to be on-site at 6:00 in the morning.
What?
Oh, I'm sorry, love.
I know I must be hell to live with right now, but you know I've waited a long time for this.
Oh, this is the reconstruction.
...after she left this building,
MacDonald's Advertising...
PETER:
Can I ask you something?
...an executive she'd been to see.
It was 6:30.
Do you ever get emotionally involved?
I mean, the more you work on a case, the more you get to know the people.
I mean, I know she's dead.
No, no, you don't get involved.
What about when you see them in the morgue?
Do you feel anything at all?
No.
But you do feel.
I mean, like the first time I went to see her parents,
Karen's parents, there was this photograph of her in the living room.
She must have been about 15 or 16, smiling, young, fresh, with her whole life in front of her.
And then you have to go to her mother and her father and tell them that that life is over, it's finished.
Awful expression in their eyes.
In that moment, I feel, like, a pain.
I feel it, and I hold on to it because it's up to me to find the man that destroyed that life.
I'm gonna get him.
I am gonna keep on at him till he cracks.
What if it isn't him?
What if it isn't this, uh...
Marlow.
George Arthur Marlow.
[ Telephone rings ]
Oh, shit!
Yes?
Is she legit?
[ Exhales ]
Okay.
Oh, yes.
Tonight.
Now.
Oh, Peter.
I think I've got him.
A witness called in, a probation officer.
She said she saw him.
She saw the man that picked up Karen.
Her description fits Marlow.
So, what now?
I'm gonna put that bastard in a lineup.
What, now?
You bet.
I want him dragged out of bed.
I want the shit scared out of him.
Jesus Christ.
What if you're wrong?
I'm not.
And if she picks him out of the lineup tomorrow, I've got him.
Witness says he called out Karen's name.
He knew her.
Mind your head.
[ Engine turns over ]
[ Engine turns over ]
I was coming from Ladbroke Grove tube station, 14th of January, 6:45 p.m.
I know the exact time because I checked my watch.
I was going to meet a girl who was at the halfway house in Hammersmith, in a café.
TENNISON:
6:45?
Karen, the girl who was murdered --
You see, the TV film jogged my memory.
I'd seen her face in photographs in the newspapers, but it never made any real impression.
The girl I was meeting was blond.
So when I saw Karen standing at the edge of the pavement, for a second, I thought it was Susan.
- Same hair.
- Sorry.
How far away was Karen?
Just across the street.
There's a bank opposite that pub, and I saw this man standing by the cash dispenser.
He had dark hair, a brownish jacket.
- He called to Karen.
- He called out?
You heard him clearly call out her name?
There was a lot of traffic, but he definitely called out her name.
We're all set.
Ms. Masters, if you'd like to come with me?
Would you all please hold your numbers in front of you?
Thank you.
Um, can you ask them to show their left profiles, please?
SLEETH:
Can you all turn to face your right?
MASTERS:
Can you ask number 6 to say "Karen"?
SLEETH:
Face front again, please.
Number 6, step forward and clearly call out the name Karen.
Karen.
You see, I'm not sure.
Number 10?
Number 10, step forward and call out the name Karen.
Karen.
Louder.
Karen.
Can I take a closer look?
Sure.
[ Door opens ]
Ask him to say "Karen."
Karen.

THE CRAB WITH THE GOLDEN CLAWS
Did you get it?
Yes.
This is what to look for.
Excellent.
And the name?
I can't.
They'll kill me.
If they find out about us, they'll kill you anyway.
You disappoint us, Dawes.
Get him!
Follow me.
No!
Forget him!
It's Dawes we want.
No!
C'mon, the Thom(p)sons are waiting.
Don't stick your nose where it doesn't belong.
You don't see me digging in the garbage.
Now where could that file have got to?
Yes, where is it?
- Maybe on the desk.
- Maybe
- on the desk.
- Precisely.
What are these?
Objects found on the drowning victim.
The one we can't identify.
I'm sure I've seen this before.
May I borrow this?
- I'll be right back.
- Right then!
Right back!
- What's got into him?
- I'd best go investigate.
Best to find these things out.
Oh dear, he forgot his cane.
Oh dear, I forgot my cane.
It's got to be in here somewhere.
Tintin, whatever are you doing?
I'm sure this scrap of paper came from a crab tin
I threw here earlier.
- You don't say?
- Really?
Well?
Well, it's not here.
Precisely.
You there!
Police.
- But...
- Open that sack now!
Would you mind if we checked your sack?
We're trying to find a tin.
Well... sure.
I guess.
No, it's not here either.
Thank you, sir.
Sorry to bother you.
Strange than strange.
I would even add:
it's really strange.
Would you mind if I keep this for a while?
- Of course not.
- I'd like to look it over.
Do you believe that?
They were looking for some kind of crab meat tin.
Mr Tintin doesn't know what he's getting into.
Yes, there's something written here.
Only I can't read it.
Let's darken these letters and see.
K...
A, R, A...
Karaboudjan.
Isn't that an Armenian name?
Well, that doesn't help much.
- Help!
- Pipe down!
Help!
Kidnappers!
- Murderers!
- What
Great snakes!
Help!
Police!
Let's go!
Hey!
I'll tend to you later, mutt.
First, I'll take care of you!
Excuse me.
Great job, Snowy!
Let's get outta here!
What happened?
Are you all right, Mr Tintin?
Oh, that poor man!
He was only trying to deliver a letter to you.
What in the world is going on?
I don't know, ma'am, but I intend to find out.
A can of crab, the word
Karaboudjan, a drowned man, a Japanese kidnapped on my doorstep:
what does it all mean?
- Hello?
- Tintin?
- Yes.
- Thomson here.
- Hi, Thomson.
- How are you?
How am I?
I've been better.
An interesting development.
We've just identified the drowned man:
Herbert Dawes.
He worked on a ship called the Karaboudjan.
Oh?
The Karaboudjan?
It's docked at Pier 4.
Thompson and I are going down there to ask a few questions.
Hello?
...
He hung up.
Ah, the Karaboudjan.
That's him?
Yeah.
His name's Tintin.
He's a reporter.
We don't want reporters around here.
Look at all the seagulls.
Look out!
You missed, fool!
- What's going on?
- Are you all right?
I'm OK, thanks.
We're onto something.
People don't kill you for sightseeing.
Now, how do we get aboard?
Hello, Tintin.
We're here to make inquiries about that drowned sailor.
Really?
Mind if I tag along?
Consider yourself our guest.
- Come along.
- Thanks, detectives.
Police, regarding Herbert Dawes.
Welcome aboard.
I'm the first mate, Allan.
I'm Detective Thompson.
Detective Thomson.
Let's go to my cabin, detectives.
You go on ahead.
Snowy and I'll take a stroll on deck.
We'll meet you here in half an hour.
- Sounds good.
- Half an hour, then.
This way, gentlemen.
Watch your step.
Right, watch my step.
Precisely.
Watch your step.
Take good care of our guest.
Understand?
Allan didn't seem pleased to see us.
What is it, Snowy?
Look at this.
Now we're getting somewhere.
Let's see what's going on.
You again!
This time I'll feed you to the sharks.
Come back here!
Wait!
It's all clear now.
He was drunk and drowned by accident.
Precisely: an accident by drowning.
Very unfortunate, but accidents happen.
Now where could Tintin be?
He couldn't wait.
He left 10 minutes ago.
But he didn't even say goodbye.
Thank you, detectives.
And watch out
- for the step.
- Righto.
Cheerio!
Raise the gangplank!
Cast off all lines!
Prepare to sail!
Wonderful.
How do I get into these messes?
Hello, Mr Tintin.
Enjoy your stroll?
It was fine.
Pardon me for not getting up.
Shut up!
How much does he know?
.
Enough to know you killed someone.
You mean
Dawes?
He wasn't the first and he won't be the last,
Mr Tintin.
Nice guy.
It'll take a miracle to get me out of this.
Snowy!
Boy, am I glad to see you!
Quick!
Chew through these ropes!
Once I'm free, we've got to find a way off this ship.
We've stumbled into a real hornet's nest.
What is it, boy?
You're the man they kidnapped!
My name's Bunji Kuraki.
I'm a policeman from Japan.
What's going on?
I've been on this case for months.
The crab tin is one of thousands that they use to smuggle narcotics.
Drug smugglers?
I tried to warn you, but they caught me.
This is a worldwide operation.
They'll stop at nothing to protect themselves.
Even murder!
- Herbert Dawes?
- Yes.
He was selling me information.
I can't unlock these chains.
Don't worry about me.
You must get a message to the police.
But I can't leave you here!
You have to!
It's our only chance.
Give it up.
He's barricaded.
The cop is still there.
What about Tintin?
There's nothing for him to eat.
We'll starve him out.
First mate Allan, report to the Captain's cabin.
That booze hound probably wants another bottle.
Then give it to him.
Right.
We'll never pull this off if he sobers up.
It's dark enough.
Time to try out my plan.
Who's there?
Trying to bushwack Captain Haddock, are you?
Backstabbing scallywags!
But...
Don't say a word.
Who are you?
A prisoner on your stinking tub.
I'll have you clapped in irons!
No one slanders Captain Haddock's stinking tub!
I've had the full tour.
I particularly liked your cargo hold full of drugs.
Drugs?
In my hold!
You didn't know?
.
Of course not!
I'm an honest man!
Who would do that?
Your first mate, Allan.
Impossible.
Allan's a good sailor.
Loyal, devoted...
Generous with the whiskey!
Face it, you've been doublecrossed.
By keeping you drunk, Allan does what he wants, including smuggling drugs.
Doublecrossed!
Horn swoggled!
Tricked by my own crew.
The shame of it all!
Come on, Captain.
Get a grip on yourself!
He won't get away with this.
But I need your help.
You have to promise:
no more drinking!
Captain, please.
Think about your reputation.
What'd your mother say if she saw you like this?
Mother?
- Mother!
- What's all that noise?
Time to go, Snowy.
- Is that you, Mother?
- What's going on?
I'm such a miserable fool.
Drink up, Captain.
This will make you feel better.
No!
I promised him I wouldn't.
Who did you promise?
I don't know.
I've never seen him before.
Fool!
Tintin!
Quick!
He's gone back to the hold!
You!
Stand guard here!
You, come with me!
He's shooting at us!
Champagne!
What happened?
Where's Tintin?
He snuck up on me, boss.
He musta been under the bunk.
Mr Allan!
The Captain and some kid jumped me.
I think they got a message off.
A lifeboat's gone.
- Fools!
- Boss!
They're not in sight.
Should we turn around?
No.
I've got a better way to deal with Tintin.
Adrift at sea.
We must be 60 miles from land with no food or drink.
We're goners.
Relax, Captain.
Snowy and I have made it through harder times than this.
Relax, Captain?
Relax!
We're going to die out here, you landlubber!
We won't!
I radioed our plans to the police.
Not long now.
A seaplane!
We're saved.
I told you not to worry.
Ahoy!
Over here!
He's coming in pretty fast.
Not fast enough for me!
Look out!
CN-3411 to Karaboudjan, come in.
This is the Karaboudjan, CN-3411.
What's your position?
Over.
Sighted target and carried out instructions.
Any sign of life?
No, sir.
Request permission to return to base.
Permission denied.
I must be sure!
Land and confirm, CN-3411.
Ten four, sir.
Over and out.
Good enough for me.
Looks like Tintin finally met his match.
Where did you come from?
Brussels, originally.
Nice going, Snowy.
Thundering typhoons!
Nothing stops this boy!
The police are awaiting the Karaboudjan in Bagghar.
CN-3411, come in.
CN- 3411.
Did you check?
Are they dead?
Mission accomplished!
Over and out!
Imagine the look on Allan's face when he sees the welcoming committee.
Just as long as I get him before the police do.
Sure we're on course for Bagghar?
Of course we're on course!
But it looks like there's trouble ahead.
Get yer nose up!
Flip yer flaps!
We're gonna crash!
Tintin, wake up!
I must pull it up.
- Pull it up!
- I'm trying!
It's gonna blow!
That was close!
Where are we?
It sure isn't Bagghar.
The storm must've blown us off course.
What have you found, Snowy?
That's a camel.
That was a camel.
It probably died of thirst.
We're as good as dead!
Take it easy, Captain!
Things aren't that bad!
Really thirsty.
Really thirsty!
Keep moving.
We can't give up.
No, I've gotta lie down.
Which bed is mine?
OK, we'll rest in the shadow of this dune, but we can't stay long.
A drink!
How are we ever gonna get out of this one?
Oh, a bottle of champagne!
I'm saved!
I'm saved!
Confounded cork!
It's on too tight!
Captain!
Take it easy!
The heat's getting to you.
Look!
A lake!
We're saved!
Oh, no!
It's only a mirage.
There is no lake.
Water!
Water!
Where are we?
Who are you?
Come with me.
There you are.
Come in.
I'm Lt. Delcourt, in command of this outpost.
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Tintin.
Take a seat please.
You had us all quite worried.
It was sheer luck we found you.
My men came across the wrecked plane, then found you 3 unconscious.
What about the Captain?
I need a drink!
He's all right.
Where are my manners?
Name your poison, gentlemen.
Nothing for us.
Captain...
Uh, no, thanks, Lieutenant.
So, tell me: what brings you to this forsaken sandbox of ours?
We interrupt this program with a special report.
Severe weather at sea has caused heavy losses to shipping.
Gale winds have driven the Tanganyika and Jupiter ashore.
An SOS was received.
from the Karaboudjan, but no wreckage or survivors were found.
Oh, no, Bunji!
It is presumed she went down with all hands.
Impossible!
Calm down.
To sink without having time to abandon ship?
I don't believe it!
Yes, I agree.
Lieutenant, we must get to Bagghar immediately.
Oh...
We'll check the Harbormaster's Office.
They'll know if the Karaboudjan sank.
Blue blistering barnacles!
Raiders!
Behind the sand dune!
Outnumbered and short of bullets!
The last one.
Revenge.
Revenge!
Captain!
Desert tramps!
Swine!
Jellyfish!
Troglodytes!
Captain, they'll kill you!
Rats!
Endoplasms!
Freshwater swabs!
Snowy, he's scaring them off!
Come back here, ya cowards!
I'll give ya a taste of my rifle butt!
Nice going, Captain!
If they'd waited, I'd have shown them!
No one shoots at me and gets away with it.
After them, men!
They're getting away!
Lieutenant!
I received a dispatch, warning about bandits in the area.
We got here just in time.
You mean it wasn't me who scared off those raiders?
I'm sure you did your best, Captain.
We'll accompany you the rest of the way.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Sure the Harbormaster's Office is this way?
The merchant said it was the other way.
Do you speak Arabic, Captain?
Then, we'll continue this way.
What is it, boy?
Allan!
Let's see where he's going.
Wait for me!
Blistering barnacles!
Why don't you...?
Tintin!
Careful, Snowy.
Allan may lead us to whoever's buying the drugs.
Oh, no!
He's gone!
Where in blue blazes is Tintin?
Blistering barnacles!
That's the Karaboudjan.
You there!
The radio said the Karaboudjan went down.
So what's it doing here?
This here's the Djebel Amilah.
Can't you read?
Of course I can read!
But that's the Karaboudjan!
You mutinous deck rat!
Tell him the real name of this ship.
Do you know this nut?
Never laid eyes on him.
Police!
Police!
Help!
Police!
What's the problem here?
That ship is the Karaboudjan.
It didn't sink!
I know
- I'm her captain.
She's loaded with crabmeat... opium.
We flew into a terrible storm and crashed in the desert.
You'd better come with us.
But... but... but...
It's the truth, I tell ya!
What?
Haddock?
You're sure?
Then you can bet
Tintin's not far behind.
Get me Haddock alive!
I don't care how you do it!
And don't let it happen again!
Flatfoots!
Pencil pushers!
You wouldn't know a crime if you fell over one, miserable gherkins!
Help!
Outlaws!
Brigands!
Captain?
Bushwackers!
Captain!
Tintin!
To find the Captain, we must go back to where we lost Allan.
Remember, Thompson, we are friendly locals.
Precisely.
Inconspicuous and blending in with the crowd.
Thomson and Thompson!
We're not Thomson and Thompson.
We're friendly locals.
Detectives,
- it's me, Tintin.
- Alive!
And well!
I need your help.
So far the only clues are the crab tins.
You say the drugs are hidden inside?
Yes.
They've got a gold label with a red crab.
We saw some tins like that this morning.
Where?
Well, ah...
I think...
There's lots of strange shops here.
There!
Where are you going?
- Well?
- Crab.
What are you doing?
- Don't worry, we'll pay you.
- Yes!
Who supplies you with those tins?
Certainly.
They come from Omar Ben Salaad, the wealthiest trader in all of Bagghar.
- Thank you.
- That's OK.
Ask around about Mr Salaad, but be discreet.
Snowy and I will try to find the Captain.
Right, then!
Thank you, sir.
Wait!
Who's going to pay?
1,000 blessings on you.
I know it's hot, boy, but to find the Captain, we must find Allan.
He came this way once.
He may come again.
Confounded paving stones!
Let's pay him a visit.
There he goes!
Keep up with him, Thompson.
Be discreet.
I bet he went down there.
Where'd he go?
He didn't disappear.
I wonder if...
A secret door!
I bet the tins are full of drugs!
Untie me, you Neanderthals!
Captain!
Crooks!
Confidence men!
Yell all you want.
No one's gonna hear you.
Now for the last time, where's Tintin?
Here I am!
Hands up!
Tintin, my boy, I'm so glad to see you!
Keep an eye on them while I find Allan.
Freeze!
Ah, gentlemen, do sit down.
May I offer you
- some refreshments?
- No, thank you, Mr Omar.
This visit is strictly business.
Quite so.
We're conducting an investigation.
A very "discreet" investigation.
I see.
And what is the nature of your investigation, gentlemen?
We think you're smuggling drugs.
By the beard of the prophet!
How dare you?
Get out!
Or I'll have you flogged!
Guards!
Guards!
Throw...
Run for it, Omar!
The jig is up!
I'm leaving now.
I'm afraid I'll have to eliminate you.
Good boy.
- Oh, Tintin!
- Well done.
Don't let him outta your sight!
He's heading for the docks.
Stop that guy!
He's stealing my boat!
Hey!
Hey, stop!
Tintin!
Hi to you, too!
Throw them in irons, the filthy pirates!
Mutineers!
Scallywags!
Fatheads!
The correct spelling is "Thompson" with a p.
If it wasn't for Tintin none of this would have been possible.
Bunji!
- You made it!
- Yes.
Thanks to you, Tintin.
I'm "Thomson" without a p!
How's it feel to be a hero?
It feels great.
THE CRAB WITH THE GOLDEN CLAWS
- Part 1
Did you get it?
Yes.
This is what to look for.
Excellent.
And the name?
I can't.
They'll kill me.
If they find out about us, they'll kill you whether you tell me or not!
You disappoint us, Dawes.
Get him!
Follow me.
No!
Forget him!
It's Dawes we want.
No!
C'mon, Snowy!
The Thompsons are waiting for us...
That's what you get for sticking your nose where it doesn't belong!
You don't see me digging in the garbage, do you?
Now where on earth could that file have got to?
To be precise, where on earth is the file?
- Maybe it's on the desk.
- I know...
- maybe it's on the desk.
- Precisely!
What are these?
Objects found on the drowning victim.
The one we can't identify.
I'm sure I've seen this before.
May I borrow this for a minute?
- I'll be right back.
- Right then!
Right back!
- What's got into him?
- I'd best go and investigate.
Best to find these things out.
That is to say...
We'd better go and investigate...
Oh dear, he forgot his cane.
Oh dear, I forgot my cane.
It's got to be in here somewhere.
Tintin, whatever are you doing?
I'm sure this scrap of paper came from a crab tin
I threw here earlier.
I thought it could help your case.
- You don't say?
- Really?
Well?
Well, it's not here.
Precisely.
You there!
Police.
- But...
- Open that sack immediately!
Excuse me, sir, but would you mind if we check your sack?
We're trying to find a certain tin.
Well... sure.
I guess.
No, it's not here either.
Thank you, sir.
Sorry to bother you.
Stranger than strange.
I would even add:
it's really strange...
Would you mind if I kept this piece of paper for a while?
- Of course not, Mr. Tintin.
- That is to say...
Can you believe that?
They were looking for some kind of crab meat tin.
Mr. Tintin doesn't know what he's getting into.
Yes, there's something definitely written here!
Only I can't read it.
Let's just darken these letters and see what comes up.
K...
A, R, A...
Karaboudjan.
That's an Armenian name, isn't it?
Well, that doesn't help much.
- Help!
- Pipe down!
Help!
Kidnappers!
Huh...!
Great snakes!
Help!
Police!
Let's go!
Hey!
I'll tend to you later, mutt.
But first, I'm gonna take care of you!
Excuse me.
Great job, Snowy!
Let's get outta here!
Ooh...
What happened?
Are you all right, Mr. Tintin?
Oh, that poor man!
He was only trying to deliver a letter to you.
What in the world is going on?
I don't know, ma'am, but I intend to find out.
A can of crab, the word
Karaboudjan, a drowned man, a Japanese kidnapped on my doorstep:
what does it all mean?
- Hello Tintin...
- Yes?
Thomson here.
- Oh...
Hi, Thomson.
- How are you?
How am I?
I've been better.
- What's up?
- An extremely interesting development.
We've just identified the drowned man:
a sailor named...
Herbert Dawes.
He worked on a cargo ship called the 'Karaboudjan'.
The Karaboudjan?
Yes, it's docked at Pier 4.
Thompson and I are going down there now to ask a few questions, and...
Hello?
...
He hung up.
Ah, the Karaboudjan.
That's him?
Yeah...
His name's Tintin.
He's a reporter.
Well, we don't want any reporters slipping around here, do we?
Sure is busy!
Eh, Snowy?
.
Look out!
You missed, fool!
- What's going on?
What happened?
- Are you all right?
Huh...
I'm okay, thanks.
We must be on something, Snowy.
People don't try to kill you just for sightseeing.
Now, how do we get aboard?
Hello, Tintin!
We're here to make inquiries about that drowned sailor.
Really?
Mind if I tag along?
Consider yourself our guest.
- Come along, Tintin.
- Thanks, detectives.
Police, regarding Herbert Dawes.
Welcome aboard, gentlemen.
I'm the first mate, Allan.
I'm Detective Thompson.
And I'm Detective Thomson.
Let's go to my cabin, detectives...
You go on ahead.
Snowy and I'll take a stroll about deck.
Fine!
We'll meet you here in half an hour.
- Sounds good.
- Half an hour, then.
This way, gentlemen.
Watch your step.
Right then, watch my step.
Precisely.
Watch your step.
Take good care of our guests.
Understand?
First mate Allan didn't seem very pleased to see us.
I wonder what's he hiding...
What is it, Snowy?
Look at this!
Now we're getting somewhere.
Let's find out what's going on...
You again!
This time I'll feed you to the sharks.
Hey...!
Come back here!
What!
It's all clear now.
Your man was drunk and drowned by accident.
Precisely, an accident by drowning.
Very unfortunate, but accidents do happen.
Now where could Tintin be?
Oh, yeah, he... couldn't wait.
He left about 10 minutes ago.
But he didn't even say goodbye!
Thank you, detectives.
And watch out for the step.
Righto...
Cheerio!
Raise the gangplank!
Cast off all lines!
Prepare to set sail!
Wonderful.
How do I get into these messes?
Hello, Mr Tintin.
Enjoy your stroll?
It was fine.
Pardon me for not getting up.
Shut up!
How much does he know about the shipment?
Enough to know you killed someone for it.
You mean Dawes?
Well, he wasn't the first and he won't be the last,
Mr. Tintin.
Nice guy.
It's going to take a miracle to get myself out of this one.
Snowy!
Boy, am I glad to see you!
Quick!
Chew through these ropes!
Once I'm free, we've got to find a way off this ship.
We've stumbled into a real hornet's nest here.
What is it, boy?
You're the man they kidnapped outside my apartment!
My name's Bunji Kuraki.
I'm a policeman from Japan.
What's going on, Mr. Kuraki?
I've been on this case for months.
The crab tin you were looking for is one of thousands that they use to smuggle narcotics.
Drug smugglers?
I tried to warn you, but they caught up with me.
This is a worldwide operation.
They'll stop at nothing to protect themselves.
Even murder!
- Herbert Dawes?
- Yes.
He was selling me information.
I can't unlock these chains.
Don't worry about me.
You must get a message to the police.
But I can't leave you here!
You have to!
It's our only chance.
Give it up.
He's barricaded.
The cop is still there.
What about Tintin?
There's nothing for him to eat in there.
We'll starve him out.
First mate Allan, report to the Captain's cabin immediately.
That booze hound... he probably wants another bottle.
Then let's give it to him.
Right.
We'll never pull this off if he sobers up.
It's dark enough, Snowy.
Time to try out my plan.
Who's there?
Trying to bushwack Captain Haddock, are you?
Backstabbing scallywags!
But...
Don't say a word.
Whowho...
Who are you?
A prisoner on this stinking tub of yours.
Why...
I'll have you clapped in irons!
No one slanders Captain Haddock's stinking tub!
I've had the full tour... thanks.
I particularly liked your cargo hold full of drugs.
Drugs?
In my hold!
You didn't know?
.
Of course not!
I'm an honest man!
Who would do something like that?
Your first mate, Allan, for starters.
Impossible!
Allan's a good sailor.
Loyal, devoted...
And generous with the whiskey!
Face it, Captain!
you've been doublecrossed.
By keeping you drunk, Allan runs this ship the way he wants, that includes smuggling drugs.
Doublecrossed!
Horn swoggled!
Tricked by my own crew.
The shame of it all!
Come on, Captain.
Get a grip on yourself!
He's not going to get away with this.
But I need your help.
You have to promise:
no more drinking!
Captain, please.
Think about your reputation.
Think about your mother.
What would she say if she saw you like this?
Mother?
What's all that noise?
Time to go, Snowy.
- Is that you, Mother?
- What's going on?
I'm such a miserable fool.
Drink up...
Captain.
This will make you feel better.
No!
I promised him I wouldn't drink anymore!
Who!
Who did you promise?
I don't know.
I've never seen him before.
Fool!
Tintin!
Quick!
He's gone back to the hold!
You!
Stand guard here!
He may try to come back.
You!
Come with me!
He's shooting at us!
Champagne!
What happened?
Where's Tintin?
He snuck up on me, boss.
He must have been under the bunk.
Mr Allan!
Mr. Allan!
The Captain and some kid jumped me.
I think they got a message off.
Sir!
One of the lifeboat's gone.
- Fools!
- Sir!
They're not in sight.
Should we turn the ship around?
No.
I've got a better way to deal with Tintin.
Adrift at sea.
We must be 60 miles from land with no food and nothing to drink!
We're goners.
Relax, Captain.
Snowy and I have made it through harder times than this.
Relax, Captain?
Relax!
We're gonna die out here, you landlubber!
No we won't!
I radioed our plans to the police.
It won't be long now.
A seaplane!
We're saved.
I told you not to worry.
Ahoy!
Over here!
He's coming in pretty fast.
Not fast enough for me!
Look out!
CN-3411 to Karaboudjan, come in.
This is the Karaboudjan, CN-3411.
What's your status?
Over.
Have sighted target and carried out instructions.
Any sign of life?
No, sir, none!
Request permission to return to base.
Permission denied.
I must be sure!
Land and confirm.
Over!
Ten four, sir.
Over and out.
Good enough for me.
Looks like Tintin's finally met his match.
Where did you come from?
Brussels, originally.
Nice going, Snowy.
Thundering typhoons!
Nothing stops this boy!
The police should be waiting for the Karaboudjan when it reaches Bagghar.
CN-3411...
Come in.
CN- 3411.
Did you check?
Are they dead?
Mission accomplished!
Over and out!
Fast Forward to Part 2 for the conclusion...
The Crab with the Golden Claws
- Part 2
Imagine the look on Allan's face when he sees the welcoming committee we've set up for him.
Just as long as I get my hands on him before the police do.
You're sure we're on the right course for Bagghar?
Of course we're on course!
But it looks like there's trouble ahead.
Get yer nose up!
Flip yer flaps!
We're gonna crash!
Tintin, wake up!
Great snakes!
- Pull it up!
- I'm trying!
It's gonna blow!
Phew!
That was close!
I don't know where we are, but it sure isn't Bagghar.
The storm must've blown us off course.
What have you found, Snowy?
Thathatha...
That's a camel.
That was a camel.
It probably died of thirst.
We're as good as dead!
Take it easy, Captain!
Things aren't that bad!
Really thirsty.
Really thirsty!
Keep moving.
We can't give up.
No, I've gotta lie down.
Which bed is mine?
OK, we'll rest in the shadow of this dune, but we can't stay long.
Haa..?
!
How are we ever gonna get out of this one, Snowy?
Oh, a bottle... of... champagne!
I'm saved!
Saved...!
Confounded cork!
It's on too tight!
Captain!
Take it easy!
The heat must be getting to you.
Look!
A lake!
We're saved!
Oh, no!
Captain!
It's only a mirage.
Captain... ooh...
Oooh...
Where are we?
Who are you?
Come with me...
Ah!
There you are.
Come in.
I'm Lt. Delcourt, in command of this outpost.
Pleased to meet you.
I'm Tintin.
Take a seat please, Mr. Tintin.
You had us all quite worried.
It was sheer luck that we found you, really...
My men came across the wreckage of your plane, and followed the tracks
They found the three of you unconscious.
What about the Captain?
Is he alright?
A drink!
I need a drink!
He's all right.
Good heavens!
Where are my manners?
Name your poison, gentlemen.
No, thanks!
And none for the Captain, either.
- What...!
- Captain...
Uh, alright...
So, tell me: what brings you to this forsaken sandbox of ours?
We interrupt this program with a special report.
Severe weather at sea has caused heavy losses to shipping.
Gale winds have driven the ships Tanganyika and the Jupiter ashore.
And an SOS was received.
from the merchant ship Karaboudjan, a rescue vessel searched the area but no wreckage or survivors were found.
Bunji!
It is presumed the Karaboudjan went down with all hands.
Impossible!
To sink without having time to abandon ship?
I don't believe it!
Yes, I agree.
Lieutenant, we must get to Bagghar immediately.
As soon as we reached Bagghar, we'll check in at the Harbormaster's Office.
They'll know one way or the other if the Karaboudjan sank.
Blue blistering barnacles!
Raiders!
Quick!
Behind the sand dune!
Outnumbered and short of bullets!
Confound everything!
The last one!
Revenge.
Revenge!
Captain!
Desert tramps!
Swine!
Jellyfish!
Troglodytes!
Captain, stop!
They'll kill you!
Rats!
Endoplasms!
Freshwater swabs!
Snowy, he's scaring them off!
Come back here, ya cowards!
And I'll give ya a taste of my rifle butt!
Nice going, Captain!
If they'd waited, I'd have shown them!
No one shoots at me and gets away with it.
After them, men!
They're getting away!
Lieutenant!
I received a dispatch, warning about bandits in the area.
Looks like we got here just in time.
You mean it wasn't me who scared off those raiders?
I'm sure you did your best, Captain.
But my men and I will accompany you the rest of the way.
Thank you, Lieutenant.
Are you sure the Harbormaster's Office is this way?
I could have sworn the merchant said it was the other way.
Do you speak Arabic, Captain?
Then, we'll continue this way.
What is it, boy?
Allan!
I knew the Karaboudjan didn't sink.
Come on Snowy, let's see where he's going.
Hey!
Wait for me!
Blistering barnacles!
Why don't you...?
Tintin!
Careful, Snowy, if we're lucky
Allan may lead us to whoever is smuggling diamonds.
Oh, no!
He's gone!
Where in blue blazes is Tintin?
Blistering barnacles!
That's the Karaboudjan.
You there!
The radio said the Karaboudjan went down with all hands.
So what's it doing here?
This here's the Djebel Amilah.
Can't you read?
Of course I can read!
But that's the Karaboudjan!
You!
You mutinous deck rat!
Tell him the real name of this ship.
Do you know this nut?
Never laid eyes on him.
Police!
Police!
Help!
Police!
Okay... what's the problem here?
That ship, officers... is the Karaboudjan.
They said it sank, but it didn't!
I'd known her anywhere.
'Cause I'm her captain.
And she's loaded with crabmeat...
I...
I mean opium.
And we just escaped by the skin of our teeth in a long boat and we flew into a terrible storm and crashed in the desert.
Oh...
You'd better come with us.
But... but... but...
But it's the truth, I tell ya!
What?
Haddock?
You're sure?
Then you can bet
Tintin's not far behind.
I don't care how you do it!
But get me Haddock... alive!
And don't let it happen again!
Flatfoots!
Pencil pushers!
You wouldn't know a crime if you fell over one, you miserable gherkins!
Help!
Outlaws!
Brigands!
Captain?
Bushwackers!
Captain!
Tintin!
Our only chance to find the Captain is to go back to where we lost Allan.
Remember, Thompson, we are friendly locals.
Precisely.
Inconspicuous and blending in with the crowd.
Thomson and Thompson!
Excuse us, please, but we are not Thomson and Thompson.
We are friendly locals.
Detectives,
- it's me, Tintin.
- Alive!
And well!
I need your help.
So far the only clues are the crab tins.
And you say the drugs are hidden inside the tins?
Yes.
They've got a gold label with a red crab.
But we saw some tins like that this morning.
Where?
Well, ah...
I think...
There's a lot of strange shops in these towns, you know?
Where are you going?
- Well?
- Crab.
What are you doing?
- Don't worry, Sir... we'll pay.
- Yes!
But could you tell us who supplies you with those tins?
Certainly, young Sir.
They come from Omar Ben Salaad, the wealthiest trader in all of Bagghar.
Thank you, Sir.
Ask around about Mr. Salaad, but be discreet, okay?
Snowy and I will try to find the Captain.
Right, then!
Thank you, sir.
Wait!
Wait!
Who's going to pay?
Ha...!
Oh...
A 1,000 blessings on you.
I know it's hot, boy, but the only way to find the Captain, is to find Allan.
He came this way once.
He may come this way again.
Confounded paving stones!
What do you say we pay him a visit?
There he goes!
Keep up with him, Thompson.
Be discreet.
I bet he went down there.
Where'd he go?
I wonder if...
A secret door!
I'll bet these tins are full of drugs!
Untie me, you Neanderthals!
Captain!
Crooks!
Confidence men!
Yell all you want.
No one's gonna hear you.
Now for the last time, where's Tintin?
Here I am!
Hands up!
Tintin, my boy, I'm so glad to see you!
Don't make a move.
Captain!
Keep an eye on them while I find Allan.
Freeze!
Ah, gentlemen, do sit down.
- May I offer you some refreshments?
- No, thank you, Mr Omar.
This visit is strictly business.
Quite so.
We're conducting an investigation.
A very "discreet" investigation.
I see.
And what is the nature of your investigation, gentlemen?
We think you're smuggling drugs.
By the beard of the prophet!
How dare you?
Get out!
Or I'll have you flogged!
Guards!
Guards!
Throw...
Run for it, Omar!
The jig is up!
I'm leaving now, detectives...
I'm afraid I'll have to eliminate you, of course.
Good boy, Snowy.
- Tintin!
- Well done!
Don't let him out of your sight!
He's heading for the docks, Snowy.
Stop 'em!
Hey!
Stop that guy!
He's stealing my boat!
Hey!
Hey, stop!
Tintin!
Hi to you, too!
Throw them in irons, the filthy pirates!
Mutineers!
Scallywags!
Fatheads!
The correct spelling for that is...
"Thompson" with a p...
If it wasn't for the actions of Mr. Tintin and his friends none of this would have been possible.
Bunji!
- You made it!
Thanks to you, Tintin.
And "Thomson" without a p!
How's it feel to be a hero, Mr. Tintin?
It feels great...!
The End.

What do we know about St Saviour's College, Lewis?
- Well, what's happened?
- A sudden suspicious death and burglary.
WOMAN:
Excuse me.
I'm Mrs Gardam.
I need to speak to someone of high rank.
Keep going, Lewis.
- Are you by any chance a Chief Inspector?
- No, madam.
That was the Chief Inspector.
We're on urgent business.
I have urgent business.
Not only urgent, but highly confidential.
This is WPC Louise Bright.
Why don't you grab a cup of tea and have words with her?
I never touch tea.

BEETHOVEN:

lewis:
Nice-looking.
Mrs Gardam, sir.
lewis:
I like women a bit plump myself.
MORSE:
Lewis!
Sorry, sir.
It's just...
Well, Valerie's got the slimming bug, suddenly.
She says she's going to a class regular.
There's an introductory promotion first.
I told her...
You like her a bit plump.
Yes.
She'd just left Communion service in the chapel.
It's High, isn't it, St Saviour's?
High?
Well, I suppose about the same height...
High Church.
Back on the job, Lewis.
She was writing.
Furiously.
Confidently.
I thought, "We've got another first here."
Anotherfirst, Dr Corder?
A starred first, possibly.
I'm not supposed to... I mean...
Well, it hardly matters now, but the word was that she'd done extraordinarily well in the other papers.
Why was she sitting this paper alone?
Because of her accident.
Ah, yes.
The bandages.
What happened?
She fell off her bike a week ago.
On the cobbles outside the gates.
She spent three days in hospital.
It looked at first as though... ..all her efforts would be wasted.
So there had to be special arrangements?
Yes.
I'm not sure if you're familiar with Oxford practice in degree examinations.
Familiar enough.
Then you probably know that when a presenting candidate is prevented from sitting an examination due to illness or injury at the authorised time and place, the rule is that provision must be made for that candidate to attempt the same paper,
within a specified time afterwards, and at a place authorised by the examiners.
Excuse me, sir.
The pathologist would like permission to move the body quickly.
- Well, what does he think?
- He's stumped, sir. lt might be poison.
Poison?
police officer:
Righto, Chief.
- Take a look at the room.
police officer:
OK, lads.
(Reads) The postexilic era?
A divinity examination, sir?
Yes.
That particular paper, I imagine, would have brought out the best in her.
She was a trained historian like me.
She achieved her college fellowship on the strength of her historical work.
Then why this qualification in divinity?
Look, I...think you'd better talk to Lance.
Lance MandeviIIe, our college chaplain.
Chief Inspector Morse.
How do you do?
Retiring chaplain.
I'm about to retire, Chief Inspector.
Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than the fat of rams.
For rebellion is as a sin of witchcraft!
I hardly think this is the time and the place, Geoffrey.

One, two, three!
It should be the man, by rights.
How much do you say he'd taken off?
Eight stone?
Not exactly pretty, though, is he?
We had a man three years ago.
No.
Make it the girl.
Girls are more popular with the punters.
That's right, Pound-Shedders. I'm back again.
Remember, this is the big one.
WOMAN:

This decides the Pound-Shedder of the Year.
WOMAN:
So, come on.
Let's get back.
Next time, when you go out there, really sell yourselves.
Right!
Let's have one more promenade, shall we, before the final selection?
Remember, it's not just about losing weight, it's about looking good.
lewis:
So, you left the chapeIjust before nine and went direct to the Senior Dining Room after the service?
- Miss Dobson?
- Miss?
Who is this "miss"?
My name's Hilary Dobson.
You can call me Hilary or you can call me Dobson. I have no title.
Right.
Come on, then, er...
Hilary.
Let's take it one step at a time, can we?
You saw Dr Hazlett into her exam and then came straight back here?
Yes!
How many times do I have to say it?
!
And there's a load of files and papers missing?
Everything!
Everything's gone!
Years of work!
Do you have a light, Lewis?
Her research, notes on a book about the early English martyrs, and everything to do with our movement.
All our meetings.
Our plans.
- That's what they were after, of course.
- Can we go back a bit?
I saw him!
I saw him on the staircase.
Victoria was so gentle.
You're losing me, Hilary.
These records you're talking about...
Our archive.
Everything on the PAX group.
Why don't you ask them?
Ask the incense and lacy frocks brigade.
MORSE:
How wide is that experience, hm?
MANDEVlLLE:
Well, one has, over the years, met most of death's representations.
Suicide, accident... slow inexorable decline.
Murder?
No.
Never that.
Victoria Hazlett was, in any case, beyond your comforts.
Yes, absolutely.
She was an unusual young woman.
Very young for a college Fellow.
The youngest ever, I believe.
And unusual in her aspirations?
What were they?
Mm?
- l'm sorry?
- Her aspirations.
Tsk!
I was in no sense her confidant.
Just because I operated, as it were, in the same general field, it doesn't follow that... ln the course of your investigations, Chief Inspector, you will, no doubt, become privy to college gossip.
No doubt.
Dr Hazlett aspired to ordination in the ministry of the Church of England.
She wanted to be a priest?
Exactly.
You don't approve of the ordination of women, sir?
Well, my approval or otherwise is of no consequence.
Ministers of the Church are the inheritors of a tradition, the spiritual descendants of Christ's apostles.
All the apostles were male.
So were all the doctors in the first century AD, but we seem to have moved on.
This is more complicated than that.
I don't intend to argue theological points.
is there anything more I can do for you?
Dr Hazlett took Communion here this morning, before she went to the examination room?
Surrounded by her supporters, yes.
Her supporters?
Two deacons and two deaconesses.
A couple of them also hold university appointments.
Well, there's some kind of informal group or organisation.
They run a hostel for what used to be called "fallen women", some of whom were in the congregation.
I imagine they'd be concerned about their friend's showing in the examination... following her accident.
Rather impressive, rallying around like that.
Psht!
Impressive or provocative?
I don't understand.
Those women have never seen fit to present themselves en masse in the college chapel before.
Four of them wore clerical dress.
Since they were ordinary communicants, that was an affront.
They don't approve of the form of service we use.
Now, why should they make a show of their solidarity today?
Yes.
Why should they?
I can only suppose it to have been, on general terms, a political statement, quite out of keeping with the spirit of the sacrament.
You were assisted by the Reverend Geoffrey Boyd at Communion?
Correct.
Where's he likely to be?
Hm?
I don't know.
In his room, or in the vicarage at St Bride's on Collet Road.
He might be anywhere.
I'm sure we'll find him, sir.

So, Hilary Dobson claims the Reverend Geoffrey Boyd ransacked the dead girl's room?
She was a bit hysterical at the time, mind.
She wouldn't thank you for the "hysterical" tag, Lewis, if she's as committed to the cause as she claims.
What's the matter with "hysterical"?
That's what men say about women.
I say it about the Desk Sergeant when he's on the rampage.
Yes, well...
The porter says there was a scout sent over from Beaufort College with a suitcase to deliver.
He didn't see him leave, but Beaufort say they know nothing about a scout or a suitcase.
Well, he's got to be our man, hasn't he?
But why?
What was in that room that anyone would want to steal, let alone kill for?
- lf it was a killing.
- Yes.
She must have been a lovely girl, that Victoria Hazlett.
For some we loved, the loveliest and the best... I want Boyd.
There's a call-out, sir.
And I want a sensible report from the path lab.
I couldn't take her seriously, somehow.
I mean, the...
What is it, a cassock?
And a cigar.
Even before she started roaring, she was a bit intense.
A bit hoIier-than-thou.
She is holier than thou, Lewis.

The chemical reaction produced by painkilling tablets...?
Communion wine...
Communion wine?
And one other substance?
Well, what is it?
What do you mean, you don't know?
Well, yes, of course.
If you need to, take expert advice.
Trouble, sir?
What's the pathology budget, Lewis?
I don't know.
Big.
Not big enough, apparently.
Victoria Hazlett's stomach contents have defeated the resources.
They've been handed over to a specialist.
An endocrinologist.
It happens, sir.
Expert witness.
Yes, it happens.
Delays happen.
- lt could be poisoning, then, eh?
- Could be.
Let's assume it is, for the moment.
Not very prepossessing, is it?
They're supposed to do a good job, though.
Our lot send them cases sometimes.
What do you reckon to all this about women going into the Church, sir?
It's no big deal.
The Methodists have had them for years.
I reckon we're seeing a particularly Oxford view of things, Lewis.
Extreme images.
God as a prissy old don nit-picking his way through the liturgy versus God as a muscular Girl Guide.
Erm...
Er, police.
Chief Inspector Morse.
Detective Sergeant Lewis.
I'm Emma Pickford.
Please, come in.
Dyb, dyb, dyb, sir.
Geoffrey!
MANDEVlLLE:

lewis:
Can I start by taking a list of your names?
There are twelve residents and five members of staff.
WOMAN:
Irene Johnstone.
We combine our duties here with church work and, in some cases, with other jobs, and we each act as counsellor to particular residents.
Victoria was responsible for Irene Saunders and Dinah Newberry.
I think you should see Dinah first.
?
MOZART TAPE: ..et Spiritui Sancto
May I come in?

Sicut...

I won't keep you long.

Et nunc
My name is Morse.
Just tell me, why weren't you at the service with the other residents this morning?
Slept in, didn't I?
Anyway, I don't go to that kind of place.
What kind of place?
Church?
Places full of people looking.
- I didn't want to let her down.
- Victoria?
People look at me and nudge each other.
I distract attention.
She didn't need me on her side.
She seems to have been on your side.
She didn't suffer, did she?
No.
No, we don't think so.
?
Amen
Lovely music.
Nothing much to report, sir.
Yes.
I think I'll save you another encounter with the cigar and the cassock, Lewis.
Get back to the college.
Forensic should be finished.
See what they've turned up.
Check that a sample of that Communion wine's been sent for analysis.
- There's some tea out there, sir.
- Yes?
Sorry, Lewis.
I'll be through with the hot water.
I'm Irene, by the way.
Let's start with the examination procedure.
A candidate who sits a paper late must, on no account, get to see the paper beforehand.
How is this achieved?
There's a system of chaperones.
The candidate is under supervision until the paper's been completed.
It was a formality in Victoria's case.
So, she was never alone from the time of her accident until her death?
Who were the chaperones?
is there a list?
I expect so.
They were all members of the university staff.
Hilary and I both did shifts.
- And you were trusted?
You were her friends.
- We were on oath.
I said, it was a formality.
Who took the final shift as chaperone?
I did. I slept in her room on a camp bed last night.
There was nothing unusual?
- No disturbance in the night?
- Nothing.
We said prayers at 1 0:30 and put out the light.
I slept like a log.
Oh, for God's sake!
We all know who's behind this.
We know nothing of the sort.
(Bell chimes)
That's it, Sergeant.
Just off.
- Did you get anything?
- Not much.
Only this, really.
- What is it?
- Exam paper.
The postexilic era.
It was under the mattress on the bed.
We'll do it for prints, but I'm not hopeful.
- l'll let you know.
- OK.
Quick as you like.
Oh.
- What about the Communion wine?
- Nothing doing.
- How do you mean?
- They knocked a whole bottle off.
The clergy have to finish any wine that's been consecrated. I never knew that.
Swigged it down, cleaned out the chalice.
- Put the bottle with the other empties.
- A bit sharpish.
Chaplain says that's normal.
Empties returned on Monday.
The Chief'll want to know why you didn't follow that up.
We tried.
The whole consignment had gone through the washer by then.
Cheers.
Look, tell him.
Tell him what's been going on around here.
Well, someone should tell me.
Jane?
There was an attempt to get the lease on this place wound up.
We traced it to a consortium of Geoffrey Boyd's parishioners.
We were refused representation on an ecumenical committee for no good reason.
There's more.
Lots more.
We started keeping a record.
is this true?
Yes.
We were going to submit it to the Bishop.
- lt's missing?
- Naturally.
Why now?
Why this morning?
Time's running out.
Haven't you heard?
I'm up for Mandeville's job when he goes.
I'm on the short list for the chaplaincy of St Saviour's.
But then, so is their candidate.
Desmond kelly.
The interview's on Thursday.
Now tell him about the bike and the accident.
It was my bike, Morse.
Victoria was riding my bike that day.
Her own was off the road, so I lent her mine.
She was going from the college to the examination school on the High.
She hit the cobbles outside the gate and came off.
It looked as if...
As if?
- lt looked as if it was the brakes.
- We don't know for certain.
hilary:
One of the students wheeled the bike away while we looked after her.
He swore that the cables had been severed and one had snapped when she tried to pull up.
- Well, surely you checked?
- l would have done, only the bike disappeared.
EMMA:
That's perfectly true.
We all searched afterwards, but there was confusion.
EMMA:
The ambulance arriving.
people crowding round.
Yourbike?
Are you saying...?
Someone meant me to have an accident, yes, Morse.
If they'll do that, they'll do anything.
hilary:
Even murder.
You don't understand.
Victoria would not cheat.
Well, what was she doing with a copy of the exam paper?
She wasn't doing anything.
I helped her make her bed in the morning.
Don't the college servants usually do that?
Not for Victoria.
In the PAX group, we have rather strict rules about performing menial tasks for ourselves.
There was nothing in her bed except her nightdress.
Then we folded my bed away.
Hilary brought us coffee.
The turnout at the chapel yesterday, to me now it seems, well, less like an act of affection, and more like a gesture of defiance.
I know.
I wasn't happy about that, either, but we'd agreed to abide by the vote.
Yet you were helping to compile a record of the other party's dirty tricks.
You must have had suspicions about Victoria's accident.
Since her death, I've let go of suspicions.
I sincerely believe the truth will emerge.
eventually.
I hope I can live up to that belief.
- ls the application for St Saviour's chaplaincy...
(Timer pings)
..another gesture of defiance?
Not exactly.
We tested the ground first.
We realised we had more support than we thought.
Then, when Hilary appeared on the short list, we knew.
Er, will you excuse me, Chief Inspector?
Morse.
Just Morse.
Morse, I have a class in half an hour.
You teach, too?
Part time, in the Italian Department.
A summer school for the next month.
Lots of Venetian teenagers who can't wait to skive off to McDonald's.
Children?
- Two boys. lt only sounds like 50!
(Running footsteps) ls there a Mr Pickford?
There was.
He died three years ago.
I'm sorry.
He'd have been proud of your achievements.
My achievements, for what they're worth, grew out of the pain of his death.
What did I say about staying in bed until you're better?
Pin him down, Marcus, and quiet!
- lf there's anything else, you let me know.
- l will.
Oh, Emma!
I'm sorry. I don't know what I...
Victoria's painkillers.
Did you see her take them
- on Sunday night?
- Yes.
Except, in the morning, she said she'd woken with the pain about three, and took two more.
Are you sure of that?
Certain.
I'm sorry. I'd forgotten.
And the pills were there when you left for the chapel?
Yes.
Both bottles. I saw them.
(Boys giggle)
Look what I've brought, and you're running away.
(Dials number)
It's me!
I'm back!
I know what you did and I'm coming to get you!
Cracked ribs.
A broken wrist.
Damage to left knee and shin.
Concussion with bruising on the skull.
So, after a week, she'd still have been in considerable pain.
Certainly.
She was discharged with a supply of tablets.
- How many?
- 50.
She'd have come back for more.
- We don't give out large amounts.
- A couple of bottles?
One bottle, more likely.
It depends on the pharmacist's stock.
I'll talk to the pharmacist.
Very good.
Let's look at the timescale on this case.
Suppose one of them, Geoffrey Boyd, say, went into Victoria's room after the service and planted the examination paper.
The room must have already been turned over.
Does that mean he knew it would be, or was he too heIIbent on his own business to care?
"Hellbent" is about it, I reckon.
- On both sides.
- Really, Lewis?
Well, the exam paper, the bike, the accident.
Those women turning up at the chapel to put the evil eye on him.
MORSE:
Why hasn't Boyd been found?
His mates washing away the Communion wine.
There's a lot of hate in this one.
I keep wondering where, you know, Christian feeling comes in.
Yes.
The wine.
(Phone rings)
Morse.
Who's speaking?
I'd like to speak to the Professor himself.
Then get him to call me as soon as he's back.
Thank you.
(Morse slams down phone)
That was our expert witness, or rather his lab technician.
- His minion.
- What about the tests?
inconclusive so far.
The extra substance looks like an amino acid that occurs naturally in the body.
Victoria Hazlett seemed to have more than her share.
Oh, come on, Lewis.
Let's do something.
Anything to report?
Irene had a prolonged bout of hysterics this morning. I felt like joining in.
- And Dinah's done a bunk again.
- Dinah?
When?
Sometime last night.
No-one thought to check her room.
You should have called me.
I was supposed to see her this afternoon.
She's raided the fridge again.
- Oh, come on.
She's done it all before.
- Not for weeks.
Not since Victoria was dealing with her.
Where do you think she's gone?
I don't know.
How would you, without the case notes,
- which they've stolen?
- We don't know that.
Not now, please.
Let's wait, at least until you've got your feet firmly under the high table.
Look, I'm sorry, but suddenly all that seems deeply unimportant.
Surely it's more important than ever?
OK. I'm sorry.
We have no choice.
I'm not happy about this, Lance.
Who said anything about happiness?
I haven't been happy since I was an undergraduate.
Even then, I suspect it was an illusion.
Duty is what matters.
- Duty is a rather movable feast, though, isn't it?
- Hm?
I mean, it's a matter of interpretation.
Tsk!
Duty is fixed.
Duty is to do with the greater good.
I thought we were resolved on the greater good in this situation.
Look, I want the chaplaincy.
On Thursday you may have it.
Now, only a fool would knowingly allow an obstacle to remain in his path.
- (Terrified whimper)
- Geoffrey.
- Geoffrey.
- No-o!
No.
MANDEVlLLE:
Geoffrey!
They saw us coming.
No, they wouldn't set us up, sir.
With fake praying?
Not a couple of vicars.
Mm-hm.
Yes.
Thank you, sir.
Yes.
Yes, all right, then.
Goodbye.
Why the air of Stygian gloom?
Think of it as providential.
I can't, Freddie. I gotta pull out.
My reputation's at stake here.
Your reputation's at stake anyway.
- What?
- If you do pull out, I mean.
You say the fat woman's on the loose again?
Who listens to fat women?
Especially when they have no evidence.
Mr Boyd always goes about this time of year.
End of term.
Whereabouts in Yorkshire?
I don't know.
Hopping all over.
He sent me a postcard once from Beverley, with the Minster on it.
- Do you still have the note he left you?
- No, I threw it away last night after I read it.
I'm paid to tidy up.
Where he will let me.
When do you expect him back?
Two weeks, maybe.
Depends how the fancy takes him.
Maybe longer.
He phones me before he's coming and I open up the house for him.
- Let us know, Mrs Hulme, the minute he calls.
- Whatever you say.
I knew there was trouble the moment I seen you.
Trouble?
He hasn't been too well lately.
Overworking.
- l thought maybe he's had an accident.
lewis:
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Nothing like that.
No joy, sir?
Not on the cause of death.
A perfect thumbprint, though, on the examination paper.
The trouble is, we've got nothing to tally with it.
But I'd like to bet, if we looked in there...
No chance of getting a warrant at the moment.
It could be all above board, this, couldn't it?
Boyd might have just popped up to Yorkshire.
Although you'd think Mandeville would have told us that's what he does.
He knows we're looking for him.
Mandeville volunteers nothing.
That stuff in the vestry, the kettle and everything.
They could have made themselves a cuppa before they went into prayers.
One plate.
One knife.
One cup.
No, no, no.
They're all afraid of something.
Get in, Lewis.
We've got to start showing results.
- pull over, will you, sir?
- What?
Oh, no, Lewis!
Well, it's three o'clock. I missed my lunch today.
MORSE:
We're heading for lunch.
lewis:
I don't fancy liquid.
I need my packing.
Please.
No speculation about the winner.
All will be revealed in a couple of days.
- Mr Galt?
- That's the end of the press call.
I'm Emma Pickford.
I work for the PAX hostel for women.
Er, we have a...mutual acquaintance.
May I talk to you
- in confidence?
- l wish you could see my itinerary.
- Please.
- Not a moment's space till Thursday.
MR GALT:
Let's discuss it on Friday.
Make an appointment.
See my secretary.
What's yours, sir?
Cod and chips.
Double chips.
- Thanks.
- Double chips. £2, sir.
That's a funny place
- to keep your family snaps.
- She's not family.
Looks like she likes her chips!
There is somebody looking for her.
Left this reminder half an hour ago.
- You don't know her, do you?
- Let's have a dekko.
She has been here sometimes, but not recently.
Who's looking for her?
Oh, I'm police.
Really?
It's one of them women from that hostel.
Good-looking, wears a parson's collar, but not the funny one with the cigar.
Yeah.
No, I don't know her. I'll keep an eye out, though.
- Thank you.
- Cheers.
Just a minute!
Excuse me!
I'll be needing you, after all.
I beg your pardon?
It's you, isn't it?
That voice on the phone.
I'm sorry about that. I would have apologised.
Look, this is different.
- Help me!
- indeed I will not.
I've been to the authorities about you.
- There was no need.
- We'll see.
Now, you leave me alone.
I want no more of this, you and your threats.
- Como, see her off!
- (Barks)
(Wails) Don't go.
Don't go!
Don't go!
It's got to be important, searching for her that hard, dishing out her picture.
They're responsible for her.
They're conscientious.
- No, I know, but...
- But what?
Well, they could have informed us.
I mean, she disappeared last night, straight after the news of Victoria's death.
She spent the previous night in the hostel.
She wasn't at Communion in the morning.
She had no contact with Victoria.
- Haven't you finished?
- Yeah.
It could be my last fish and chips.
Val says she won't have them in the house once she starts this slimming lark.
Chief Inspector Morse.
- Oh, yes, I spoke to you this morning.
- Ah.
Professor Briardale's just asked me to call you back.
About time.
Tell him I'm here, would you?
Someone's been pouring money in.
Where's it come from?
There's never any shortage of funds for this kind of research.
No wonder the humanities are being elbowed out.
Chief Inspector Morse?
Please, come around.
Hi.
Good to meet you.
- You've certainly given us the run-around today.
- Oh, yeah?
What do you do here normally?
We design formulas for medication.
AII this, erm... it's nothing to do with that break-in, is it?
What break-in?
A week ago. lt was nothing.
Nothing went missing.
A broken window, that's all.
Some druggie, maybe, trying his luck.
You should have reported it.
I didn't want to waste your time.
I don't now, either.
I'm only sorry I can't help you.
I really am, but I've never seen anything like this before.
A substance that precipitated cardiac arrest, you say?
Well, in conjunction with the substances already present, yes.
The painkillers and the small amount of alcohol in the wine.
They acted on one another.
The system went into overdrive, in effect, and then blew a fuse.
The painkillers were a standard type?
Oh, sure.
Perfectly harmless in regular doses.
And she took an extra dose in the middle of the night.
really?
There wasn't a great deal of it around, but it can be flushed out very quickly.
If this were a poisoning...
No, I can't buy that.
The poisoner would need a postgraduate degree in endocrinology to bring it off.
No, the stuff, whatever it is, got in there by accident.
Or she may have produced an excess of that particular amino acid naturally, within her own body.
When will you know for certain?
We can only keep testing.
Sorry.
You're new to Oxford, I believe, sir?
The brain drain in reverse.
I was honoured to be invited.
In spite of... forgive me, the difference in salary between American and British professorships?
What's money where there's honour?
I get by. I have consultancy work.
Who knows?
Maybe you'II use me as an expert witness again.
Who knows, sir?
Well, it's been a great pleasure meeting you.
I'm er...
Hank, by the way.
Goodbye, sir. I'll be in touch.
?
MOZART:
Laudate Dominum
?
Manet...
Missing.
A cache of papers, ornaments, photographs, pills, a bicycle.
And precise cause of death.
Geoffrey Boyd and Dinah Newberry.
?
Gloria Patri et Filio
?
Et Spiritui Sancto
Hello, Emma?
It's Morse.
Has Dinah Newberry been found?
No.
She wouldn't be capable of... ..well, hiring someone to do a burglary?
Dinah?
You met her.
She's a poor soul, Morse.
What was likely to have been in Victoria's file about her?
Counselling work is absolutely confidential.
Good night, Morse.
Good night, Emma.
?
A-a-a-amen
?
A-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a... ?
A-a-a-a-a-amen
(Dials phone number)
Morse.
Still a total blank?
He can't be found in Yorkshire?
(Murmur of voices)
I don't like it, Morse.
Nor do I, sir.
Don't start any of that fencing with me!
Where did the press report come from?
The same source as your anonymous tip-off?
I can't do with this.
Locking up Mandeville.
It assumes a connection with a crime, a connection you haven't made yet.
He's withholding information, sir.
I've been looking at him on and off, checking.
He spends most of the time down on his knees.
That's where you'll be, I'm telling you, if you don't make this stick.
The thumbprint on the examination paper, sir - we've had confirmation it was Boyd's.
At least, it matches the prints we found at the vicarage.
Well, Boyd was obviously barmy.
- But MandeviIIe isn't.
- No.
He's clever.
There were seven or eight of them on the job last night.
- Why didn't you bring them all in?
- We have their names.
Desmond Kelly and some theology students.
They'll make themselves available if they're needed.
The Reverend Dr Mandeville insisted they were all acting on his instructions.
He volunteered that, did he?
That's all he's volunteered so far.
I'm seeing him again this morning.
Well, don't keep him a minute after 1 2 o'clock.
Unless you're charging him.
All right.
(Sighs)
The room you saw last night, it was only evidence of the stress Geoffrey had been under recently.
Where is he?
I am not at liberty to tell you.
But you do know?
You won't be at liberty at all unless you give me an explanation.
Have you never heard of a priest's duty to respect a confidence?
But that's not what we're talking about here, is it?
What about this stress that Boyd was supposed to be under?
Well, he had heavy parish duties, as well as his college work.
He was conscientious with his students.
There's no doubt he allowed this...
"woman" question to get somewhat out of hand.
only "somewhat"?
Do you know what I think?
There was nothing in that room last night that wasn't implied in the first conversation I had with you.
Hejust gave it some substance.
Visit him there, did you, sometimes?
Of course not.
He only saw visitors in his study.
I was more than shocked by what I found there.
The man was ill.
Now, there we agree.
But no-one becomes as ill as that suddenly.
There must have been signs.
Why didn't you act sooner?
I acted when I saw fit.
I'd say you acted to protect the interests of your candidate for the chaplaincy.
As I explained in my statement, I wanted to avoid any possible misunderstanding of Geoffrey's character or motivation.
He was essentially devout and humble.
Was he involved in Victoria Hazlett's accident the week before her death?
I know nothing of that.
And nothing of the fact that someone clearly spent a night in the chapel vault recently?
The vault?
Are you familiar with the terms of church architecture?
Below the altar.
As opposed to the vestry...beside the altar.
We've been very thorough.
And you know nothing, of course, about the bogus scout from Beaufort who removed Dr HazIett's papers from her room?
This is absurd!
is it?
I intend to find Geoffrey Boyd.
Get rid of him.
Remain available in Oxford, like the others.
I rarely leave Oxford.
I stake my oath that Geoffrey is neither a murderer nor a thief.
And may God forgive you, Chief Inspector.
I doubt if your God would have much truck with the likes of me.
At least, I hope he wouldn't.
Da-da!
- lt looks like you sat on a ferret!
- Oh, no.
Now, listen to this.
Listen.
There was a big surprise in store for one of the detectives investigating the St Saviour's College death and burglary when, acting on a hunch, he disturbed a hornet's nest of clerics.
(Hysterical laughter) Irene:
I can't believe it!
- lt can only do us harm.
How?
You know Oxford.
The refined distaste for tabloid publicity.
The opposition will close ranks and gather support.
I doubt it.
They're finished.
I don't want us to win on those terms.
What does it matter?
It's what we've worked for.
Anyway, "win" is a bit premature.
There are three other candidates.
The only two that matter are you and Desmond Kelly.
(Boisterous laughter)
No word from Dinah, I suppose?
That's not her style, making contact first.
She'll just materialise one day in her all too too solid flesh.
The sooner the better.
You're not worried, are you?
It's not as if she can do us any harm, is it?
is it?
I'd like a word with you.
I'm sorry. I'm late for work.
It won't take a moment.
Just listen.
Shove off!
I don't know you.
Just talk to me for a minute.
- Please, just help me...
- Nick!
Give me a hand, would you?
You just stormed past your fan club there, sir.
Mrs Gardam.
She'll be after us.
Keep your mind on the job, Lewis.
Mandeville's stalling, so we'll embarrass him further.
- Find that bike.
- What?
Hilary Dobson's, you mean?
It's no go, sir.
We agreed.
Get hold of Hilary Dobson.
Take her with you.
There's thousands of bikes.
Right.
So think.
If someone wanted to hide a bike, wouldn't he pick a place where it could be camouflaged by dozens, maybe hundreds, of others?
There's usually plenty around the colleges.
They're usually gone by the evening.
One left would stand out.
The PAX women checked on that themselves.
No.
Where's the heaviest concentration?
The station, Lewis.
Start with the station.
All those bikes left there while their owners take trips to London and back.
The station's only half a mile from St Saviour's.
OK. lf you say so.
Oh, sir.
What is it?
It's a bit personal, like.
I need to be off duty on the dot tonight.
My mother-in-law's not available and Val's dead set on going to this slimming promotion. lt's... I don't need to hear the details.
I don't often ask, sir.
Square up to the case, Lewis, and maybe we can both be off "on the dot".
Fair enough.
Chief Inspector Morse!
Chief Inspector Morse!
PORTER:
Morning, Dr Pickford.
- Morning.
(Fountain gurgles)
(Bell chimes)
Good morning, Morse.
Good morning.
I'm not sure whether I should be pleased or alarmed when I see you.
I'm only pleased when I see you.
I er...
I wanted to call you, prepare you for the news, but er... ..I got caught up in red tape.
I wish it could all be a bit more, you know, low-key.
Sensationalism always obscures the real issues.
- l'd like to talk to you about the real issues.
- Now?
Not if you prefer to talk over dinner.
I know I would.
Erm...
Yes. lt sounds like a nice idea.
I'm sorry. I don't often get asked out for dinner.
I can't think why.
There speaks a man who's never seen me in my cassock and dog collar. I won't wear them.
Wear what you like.
When?
Tonight?
What about baby-sitting and so on?
There's always Francesca.
She au pairs for me. I teach her English.
And er...
Jeremy's more or less over his tonsillitis.
So, yes, tonight.
I'll pick you up.
- Seven-thirty?
- Seven-thirty.
Steady on, Hank. lt's almost over.
She cornered my lab technician, large as life.
- Much larger, surely?
- l know it was that woman.
She's helpless.
Forget it.
We have a deal to clinch.
Do your well-informed stuff.
Be authentic.
This is blackmail, Freddie!
I wish you'd realise we've done nothing wrong.
Unlike the naughty vicars.
- Did you see the papers?
- Don't remind me.
Why this now?
I thought you had Mandeville locked up.
It's routine police work, Miss...
Hilary.
I have work to do.
Looking for Dinah Newberry?
No, not especially.
I have evensong and then I have to memorise some notes for my interview.
What are the odds on you landing this job?
Evens.
Five years ago, they'd have been nil.
- That's progress.
- Yes.
Even St Saviour's can't avoid it completely.
Oh, I don't know.
There's a panel - eleven academics and clergy.
Four of them are implacably against us.
They're waiting for lightning to strike the chapel roof.
Three of the others have stated they'd welcome a woman.
That leaves...four in the balance.
What'll you do if you lose?
Go on.
Target another college.
So you're putting together a power base, then?
Dead right, Lewis.
It doesn't seem very godly, somehow.
Well, we have to make our voices heard from the positions that are open to us.
Emma grasped that early on.
She's a brilliant tactician.
- Do you mind if I smoke?
- Er, no, no.
No.
Look, this is daft, this searching.
I'll have a word with the staff.
No, no, no.
You stay.
Enjoy your...smoke.
Chief Inspector!
Chief Inspector, I'm still here.
Please, Chief lnspector. I won't keep you long.
I've left my Como with Mrs Harrison.
I'm about to go off duty.
Beautiful flowers.
Roses.
My late husband used to say I should be surrounded by them.
Sergeant Lewis told you there's been a development?
I'll give you 30 seconds, Mrs Gardam.
I know you're very busy, so I brought this for you to look at.
Then we can have a proper talk tomorrow.
I've put a little note inside explaining things, but I don't want anyone but you to see.
- There are legal implications.
- l'll remember that.
Are you sure you won't take just a tiny peep now?
Sir!
Sir, I've got it!
Come and have a look.
I'll say bye-bye, then.
Brake cable cut.
It's not been touched, sir. I had my gloves on.
- Well done, Lewis.
- Brilliant. I'd say it's worth a promotion.
There was a porter there.
Said he'd noticed it'd been parked up for a week in a corner.
Never been moved.
Get it over to Forensic. I doubt if they'll find any prints. it's been out in the open for a week.
Might be something under the saddle or the handlebars.
He'd have had to grip it to wheel it.
- You're quite sure this is your bike, Hilary?
- There's no question.
Look... this is my St Christopher.
Victoria gave it to me before I made the short list.
I'd...
like it back as soon as you've finished with it.
- Before my interview, if possible.
- We'll do our best.
You forgot your flowers!
I've left my particulars on your desk.
We'll have a good talk tomorrow.
Nice flowers, sir.
Yes.
Nothing else for tonight, then?
- No.
You're off, Lewis.
- Thanks, sir. I appreciate that.
- l may not be so accommodating in future.
- Point taken.
I'll see you tomorrow, then.
Have a nice time yourself.
Emma's got a date tonight, too.
Cheers, then.
Still no sign of the elusive Geoffrey?
No sign.
I'll keep my ear to the ground.
Well, evensong.
Morse!
- You found the bike, then?
- Lewis found it, sir.
Still, it's not much of an advance, is it?
Are you still out to get the clergy?
Someone who is capable of causing an accident is capable of arranging a burglary and performing a murder.
If it is murder.
We don't know that, do we?
There is another thing, sir.
I'd like permission to change the expert witness.
What?
Sack Briardale?
Get another opinion.
You're mad!
He's the best there is.
So everyone says. I'd like to try the second best.
We'll talk about it tomorrow.
What's this joke going round the office about a bunch of flowers?
Good night, sir.
?
MENDELSSOHN:
Venetian Gondola Song, Opus 1 9, No.6 in G Minor
You know, it fits, you an interpreter at the United Nations.
That's where all this style comes from.
Style?
What style, Morse?
Well, you're a stylish woman.
With a rare vocation.
Well, if I'm honest, that's partly deliberate.
Defeating the stereotype.
I Iike clothes.
I wear earrings.
I paint my nails like any normal woman.
I hope other "normal" women get the message.
And after New York?
Marriage to a young professor.
Children.
How did it end?
Cancer.
It took him two years to die, in great pain.
Was that when erm...
I mean... did you go through some sort of conversion?
No.
It was more erm... ..a gradual recognition of...
..that something was waiting for me.
I mean, I gave up going to church in my teens.
RebeIIed, I suppose, against what I saw was snobbery and hypocrisy.
Then it changed, when I wasn't looking.
Later, when I needed it, there was suddenly this amazing source of strength.
Doubters like me would say the strength was already there, within you.
It's in all of us.
The trick is... allowing it to present itself.
What about you?
Sometimes, when I am listening to music...
Two practical things.
First, why won't you let us help you find Dinah Newberry?
- Who told you she was missing?
- My sergeant picked it up.
She'd be terrified of the police.
Give me until...
Friday.
If she's not back by then, you can pull out all the stops.
If you're sure?
Quite sure.
Your second "practical thing"?
You mentioned that there were two bottles of painkillers on Victoria's bedside table in the morning.
- That's right.
Yeah.
- So they must have been there the night before.
I suppose so.
I'm sorry. I can't get a clear picture.
But you saw her take the standard dose before she went to sleep?
Yes. I poured her a glass of water.
Thank you.
That's the end of the interrogation.
But if you do remember any more details, just call me.
Call me anyway.
GALT:
There you have the value of saturation advertising, linked to a specific promotion.
Every member of this audience is leaving with a new girl, a new image of herself- or himself, of course.
Not all of them Pound-Shedders of the Year, but...
Your mam's going to be pleased, isn't she?
Us turning up to give her a lift back.
Yes, she is.
Save her standing around waiting for a bus or a taxi.
Oh, here they come now.
GALT:
It'll reach a peak two or three weeks after we announce the results.
I can't see your mam, though.
DlNAH:
Aaa-argh!
MAN:
I've got her.
lewis:
What's going on?
Dinah?
lewis:
Leave her alone!
Dinah!
It's Dinah Newberry, isn't it?
Val, come here.
Dinah!
- Morning.
- Morning, sir.
- Morning, sir.
- Good morning!
Morning, Lewis.
It's out of my hands, Freddie.
They brought in a second expert witness.
I hope you took that as a monstrous affront to your integrity.
Just remember there's a perfectly reasonable explanation.
- How's your security?
- More than adequate.
It'd better be, after last night.
MORSE:
Dinah Newberry?
Yes, sir. I tried phoning you at home till...
after 1 2, must have been.
I was out.
Dinah Newberry.
- Are you quite sure?
- Yeah.
We could put out a call for her now.
She was creating a disturbance.
We'll leave it for the moment.
I'll ring Emma at some point and tell her.
You're putting a lot of trust in her judgment, aren't you, sir?
My own judgment, Lewis.
We'll be getting another angle on the cause of death soon, then we'll review the facts.
In the meantime, you'd better look into this stuff from Mrs Gardam.
Give it to the appropriate officer.
(Phone rings)
Morse.
No.
Not yet.
Thank you.
That's interesting.
We'II look into that.
Goodbye, and er... good luck.
You're welcome.
That was your favourite cigar-smoking cleric, Lewis.
She suggests we take a ride into the country.
EMMA:
hilary, we're ready.
I've just been having a word with Morse.
- Morse?
- He's one of the good guys, Morse.
My St Christopher arrived this morning with a policeman.
I thought he rated a thank you.
Yes, he is one of the good guys.
No.
Look, sir.
You can't ignore this!
Mrs Gardam was getting telephone calls.
Started three weeks ago, then stopped.
A woman telling Mrs Gardam she was about to be found out.
- Threatened her in person yesterday.
- "Found out"?
Mrs Gardam is a fusspot.
You've got slimming on the brain, Lewis!
"Page 1 1 ," she says.
(Reads) You'll behold me as I was in my palmy days.
What year is that thing?
1 979?
We all had our palmy days then, Lewis.
Blimey!
What a difference!
She must have piled on five stone since.
Pound-Shedder of the Year?
Lewis, we're supposed to be reviewing the facts of the Victoria Hazlett case.
There's a fact here, sir.
(Journalists all talk at once)
- l didn't reckon on this.
- ignore it.
And remember, whatever happens, we've all acted for the best.
All of us.
PORTER:
OK, stand back.
Stand back.
- You can do it, hilary!
- We're all with you.
We'II be thinking of you all the way, hilary.
- Our prayers are with you, hilary.
- Good luck, hilary.
We're all backing you, hilary.
- Good luck.
(Applause)
Good morning, Emma.
Good morning, gentlemen.
Would you like to follow me, please?
Well, this is it.
- You can do it!
- Good luck, hilary!
Dinah Newberry again.
I've got to be honest, sir.
I never liked the way we left that thread dangling.
Point taken, Lewis.
She's got a grudge against the Think Thin people because she's got fat, like Mrs Gardam.
- They were both champion slimmers.
- An eating disorder.
She started getting disruptive, phoning people up and that.
Until Victoria Hazlett took her on.
And after Victoria died, she started again.
Her file was in Victoria's room.
So was Emma.
All night.
Yeah.
Well... I think we should go over Dinah Newberry's known movements again.
We'll get a car out to take you back.
- See Mrs Gardam first.
- Me, sir?
Yes, you, Lewis.
And check with the Think Thin organisation.
Find out if they've had any trouble lately.
There's a legal matter involved.
lewis:
well, then, Iet's have it.
They make you sign a paper, you see, when you become Pound-Shedder of the Year, to say that you'll never involve the Think Thin organisation
- in any publicity not sanctioned by them.
- What does that mean?
Well, basically, it means that if you... well, fill out a bit, like me...
Only it's glandular with me. I eat next to nothing.
Yeah.
Go on.
You mustn't be photographed or give interviews or anything.
It's bad for the organisation's image, I suppose.
They take you over, body and soul, for a year, and then they drop you.
I see what you mean.
When did Dinah Newberry first get back in touch?
is that who it was?
What?
You didn't know?
I didn't recognise her.
I never really had anything to do with her, apart from handing the sash over at the end of my year.
well... whoever it was said that I'd been photographed in my present condition.
She'd made a...
Oh, what did she say?
A dossier.
- A dossier?
- It was all going to come out in the newspapers.
I didn't want the Think Thin organisation to imagine that I'd done it willingly.
Well, they could sue.
(Distant bell chimes)
It's the Reverend Geoffrey Boyd, isn't it?
Chief Inspector Morse.
Thames Valley Police.
Do you understand, sir?
We know about the examination paper and the bicycle and a few other dirty tricks.
Have you anything to say?
Sir?
About Victoria HazIett's death?
Who brought you here?
What do you think you're doing?
Thames Valley Police.
Am I supposed to be impressed?
Come out of there at once and leave my patient alone.
I'm sorry. I'm making enquiries.
Then you will make them to thin air outside the gates.
I could compel you to cooperate.
Oh, you ridiculous man!
Of course you couldn't.
I answer to a much higher authority than the Thames valley police.
Please go.
Ironic, isn't it, sir, that you should end up surrounded by women?
Devour thy living with harlots.
With harlots.
?
BACH:
Well Tempered Clavichord, Book ll, Prelude No.1 4
I've just left the Reverend Geoffrey Boyd, sir.
Well, where did you leave him?
In one of your comfortless cells?
No, sir. I left him where l found him.
He wasn't comfortable, though.
At least, not in his mind.
I'd say he'll be in torment for the rest of his life.
You might have saved him that if you'd acted sooner.
The fact that I didn't may well be my lifelong torment.
hilary:
We did it!
(Cheering and applause)
WOMAN:
congratulations, hilary!
- Well done!
- We knew you'd do it.
- l really was hoping you would.
- l always thought you would.
- Lewis.
- l think we should get moving, sir.
There's definitely something going on with Think Thin.
I've been onto some session leaders.
I'd say they've been told to keep quiet.
One thing I did find out, though - the whole outfit's about to be taken over.
There's a press conference this afternoon down at the health farm.
And there's another thing too.
They've got a new consultant as part of the package.
Hank Briardale.
Briardale?
We did it, Morse!
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.
Did you find him?
Yes.
How did you know he was there?
One of my contacts from the sick-visiting network.
I'm just glad it all worked out right in the end.
I only wish Victoria could have been here.
It's not the end, sir.
Yes, Lewis.
Get onto HQ.
Say I want a check on Briardale's American background.
Ask if that lab report is through yet.
- l just want to have a word with...
- l wouldn't, sir.
She lied to you.
lewis:
It was the little lad.
The one that's had tonsillitis.
- Jeremy.
- Yeah?
Smashing kids, both of them.
But he happened to say his mam had let him get out of bed Sunday night to watch the cricket highlights on the telly.
He couldn't sleep for being poorly.
Anyway, I saw the cricket highlights Sunday.
They didn't even start till 1 1 :45.
Then he says she tucked him up and lay on the bed with him.
- So...
- So she couldn't have been with Victoria, as she claimed, from Sunday night to Monday morning.
Right.
Sorry, sir.
It must have been a wrench for her to leave the kid when he was ill.
She waited until Victoria was asleep, after the painkillers, then left.
She came back in the morning to wake her up.
Yeah.
Only Victoria had taken a second dose in the meantime.
Of some other pills, by mistake.
Pills that were brought by a late visitor.
Dinah Newberry with her file?
But how would she have got in?
The college would have been locked.
Someone spent the night in the chapel vaults.
police radio:
Chief Inspector Morse?
Bravo alpha.
Morse.
- A message for you, sir.
- Go ahead.
The report's in from the second expert witness, sir.
(Applause)
GALT:
And so, ladies and gentlemen, we are handing over the entire Think Thin organisation... ..in as fit condition as we hope to achieve with every single one of our clients...
..to the health Incorporated Foundation of America.
GALT:
The structure includes a chain of slimming clubs, a thriving magazine and this, the aspect of which I am most proud...
..the Think Thin Health Club.
(Galt drowns conversation) ..at a time when a whole new revolutionary approach to the concept of slimming is opening before us.
It was a metabolic stimulant.
The unidentified substance, Lewis.
What is it slimmers really want?
To get thin without dieting.
Exactly, and how is that achieved?
They can't get away with amphetamines any more.
If they could find a way to raise the whole metabolic rate... (Brass band plays)
(Band stops)
Please, everyone!
After a long and creative association, I come to my last, pleasant duty, which is to name the Pound-Shedder of the Year for 1 990.
The winner's name is Dodie Cunningham from Norwich.
(Fanfare)
(Applause)
Dodie achieved a weight loss of seven stone ten pounds.
She has also recovered her girlish vital statistics of 34-23-35.
Terrific, Dodie!
And here, to hand over her title, is last year's champion.
- Margaret Blythe...
- Hey, you!
Listen!
This is how you'll end up.
DlNAH:
Like me!
See this?
See this?
Fat!
Fat!
Don't touch those pills!
- They're poison!
Poison!
EMMA:
Dinah!
Listen to me.
Dinah, this isn't the way.
Come on, Dinah.
Let go of the knife.
Give me the knife, Dinah.
EMMA:
Come on.
It's all right, Dinah. lt's OK.
We'll go on working together from where Victoria left off.
I know. I know. I know what you've been through.
How did you know?
She didn't tell you, did she?
It was a secret.
It was confidential.
Only Victoria was supposed to know.
Anyway, you left her in the night.
Shh, shh, shh.
I lied to you, Morse.
I know.
Shh.
There's a good girl.
I'm obliged to take you in for questioning, Miss Newberry.
It's all right.
I'll go with her.
Come on.
It's OK now.
Everything's fine. lt's all right.
Good girl.
Come on.
GALT:
I can't think why you made such a fuss about appropriating those pills, Chief Inspector.
We'd have given you as many as you can carry.
They contain a harmless metabolic stimulant, developed by me in the United States and produced in my labs here.
GALT:
The formula is made up by a reputable pharmaceutical firm.
The stimulant is present only in minute amounts.
You should have read the small print, Inspector.
What's envisaged is a trial made up of Think Thin volunteers very carefully screened for their suitability, and won't be available to the public for some time.
I think we'll find when we check with your pharmaceutical firm that the prototypes weren't harmless.
As you discovered when you examined Victoria HazIett's body.
The tests were incomplete.
I defy anyone, even your expert witness, to prove what you're implying.
This is rather going to tarnish your honour in Oxford, isn't it?
Why didn't you report the break-in at your laboratory?
You must have known these new pills had been stolen.
If that girl is a thief as well as a potential killer, why are you wasting time questioning us?
GALT:
It's outrageous!
Tell me, sir, what did you do when you discovered Miss Newberry might upset your plans?
Use a private investigator, who then usefully posed as a college scout and retrieved the evidence?
I shall be writing to the Chief Constable.
(Laughter) I've arranged for Dinah...
Miss Newberry... to be released into your care, pending her appearance in court.
Thanks.
Come in, Dinah.
Everyone's waiting for you.
No, I'll just stick it out in my room.
Irene:
You've got a new room, next to mine.
And we've got a jogging squad together.
You're on it, sunshine.
We'll get that flab off you!
Come in, Morse.
No, I can't stay.
Please?
I'll er...need a revised statement from you.
I'm prepared for that.
It seems that Dinah had compiled some sort of dossier on what she thought were false claims in the slimming business.
She took it to Victoria on Sunday night, along with the pills.
They had some sort of conversation, although Victoria must have been pretty drowsy from the painkillers.
And took an extra dose from the wrong bottle.
The slimming pills were not fatal on their own.
That's the point.
MORSE:
So, we can only get gait and Briardale on minor charges.
And the takeover?
I'm sure that health Incorporated will erm...
What's the expression?
"Maximise their profits."
My guess is that gait and BriardaIe will die rich.
What about Dinah and the other victims?
They won't die rich.
- Victoria didn't die rich.
- No, no, she didn't.
You should have told me, Emma.
I know.
I'm sorry.
I was going to, after Hilary had done the interview.
But if the rule about chaperones was a formality...
Even so...
You know.
You saw.
You saw what we were up against.
I wrote in my report that your absence was understandable because of your son's illness.
You're known around here as one of the good guys, Morse.
What will you do now?
I would like to go on working with Dinah.
But I broke the rules, so I'll offer my resignation to the PAX group.
They'd be fools to accept it.
Remember me?
I'm Irene.
What's yours, sweetheart?
We've got beer and orange juice.
- No, no.
Really, I can't.
- Please stay, Morse.
Well, in that case... I'll have the orange juice.

[Cheering And Whistling]
Thank you.
[Laughs]
Thank you.
Welcome to the show.
I came out here tonight because...
I know you're sitting and you're watching at home... and somebody introduced me and you were goin', "Who is that?"
So I'm going to introduce...
First I'll reintroduce you... to all the other Fly Girls, if you don't know 'em by now... and then I'll introduce you to our newest Fly Girl.
- Starting here with Deidre, Cari, Michelle.
- [Applause]
This is our newest Fly Girl, Carla Garrido.
[Cheering]
That's Carrie Ann and Lisa.
And of course you gotta say hello to the one and only...

Sit tight.
We'll be right back.
Lots of fun.
Guaranteed.

Bob, you think you could try to clean the windshield?
It's filthy.
- [Scratching]
- Oh, heck!
I just cleaned these wipers last week.
There's got to be a better way to clean a windshield.
[Thump]
What was that?
How y'all doin'?
Havin' a nice day?
[Man] Yes, forget about lousy wiper blades.
In fact, forget about windshield wipers entirely.
Introducing Mr. Squeegee.
Your windshield will sparkle forjust pennies a day.
[Tires Screeching]
He sticks to your car like glue, even under the most extreme driving conditions.
And he's guaranteed not to shake loose.
- [Scream] - [Thud]
[Horn Honks]
[Yelps]
Look here, man.
I'm just trying to make an honest dollar.
Help a brother out, homey.
Help me get something to eat, man.
- How about you, Miss Lady?
- [Coin Drops]
All right.
Have a nice day.
Wipers never work when you need them.
Mr. Squeegee works whether you need him or not.
Not only are we cleaning our windows...
But we feel really good about it too.
Hey, look here, man, let me get a "sammich," man.
Gentlemen, we are the only studio in town... without a single black filmmaker.
This is a a key market that we simply have to tap... so today I have lined up meetings... with some of the hottest young black filmmakers in Hollywood.
This must be the place!
Now, wake up the dotted line 'cause the Funkateers are here to sign.
On the good foot, you know?
Gentlemen, you're early.
And you look sweet enough to eat, honey.
Oh, I get a cavity just lookin' at you, sweet thing!
Look here, home skillet, save some for dessert, ya know?
- Now, you must be...
- Funky Finger Producciones.
- I'm Clavell.
- I'm sorry.
I don't see your name here.
- And I'm Howard Tibbs III.
- Let me give you one of my business cards.
You know, I'm fresh out.
Howard?
Bam!
All right, the number's here, but you're gonna have to read real quick... 'cause it's growing back fast.
- I'm gettin' ready to buy one of them blow out kits.
- Basketball Afro for days!
Well, it is certainly a pleasure to meet you both.
Let me start by introducing you to our vice president of publicity, Lee Dagget.
- Say what?
- Bam!
You're just the man I wanted to see.
- You all right, homeboy?
- All right.
- Look here.
- Don't push him out the car.
Interesting title.
Oh Knats.
No, no, no.
You got that backwards.
Let me see this here.
That's Stank Ho.
See, it's a love story.
It picks up where Pretty Woman left off... only this time, she does all her shopping at Fatburger, ya know?
Did I mention I had a doctor's appointment?
Block 'em at the door, homey!
[Laughs]
Gentlemen, it has just been a real pleasure meeting you.
We ain't done yet, big legs!
You know, it's a two-picture deal.
Howard, show 'em the trailer.
I really don't think we have time for this.
Whoo!
Bam!
Now, you see, this is a little ditty we like to call...
Dirty Dancing With Wolves.
Ain't no function at this junction.
- I had the time of my life.
- I'm just kiddin', y'all.
But I never met this wolf before.
- Let's take it downtown, home skillet.
- Break it down.
Look here, homey, I hate to interrupt this thing... but the costume got to be back in just about 15.
- And the bus...
- And here comes my bus.
- There go the bus.
- You got change for a dollar?
I got it.
Leroy, bring my camera by later, could you?
Now how does that grab you, matzo grip?
- Ahh!
- Well, you know, I think I've seen just about enough.
Your 12:00 is here, Lisa.
Do you two know you left your sandwich cart outside?
Well, ain't that a chocolate chip cookie?
You know, I knew we forgot something!
Hey, look, y'all!
Who's hungry?
- Please show these gentlemen out.
- Did I mention we also produced...
My Afro's Too High to Box with God?
Right, and Teenage Mutant Negro Turtles.
Say, say, say, brother!
- Isn't that Wes Unseld?
- Love your work, man!
Carla, the coast is clear.
Can I borrow, uh, you know, a feminine product?
- Oh, you mean a tampon?
- Shh.
Yes.
Hurry.
Thanks.
That time of the month, huh, Joyce?
That's not cleavage.
It's swelling.
Suffering from P.M.S., Joyce?
[Laughs]
See?
I told you she looked bloated.
Can't seem to disguise the fact that it's your time of the month?
Well, now Femco brings you Fashion Tampons.
Stylish, comfortable and fun.
They come in assorted colors and go with any outfit.
Ooh, Joyce, I love those earrings!
Thanks, Carla.
Actually, they're tampons... conveniently packaged in boxes of 12, 24 and 186.
And they're super absorbent.
Something you just can't find in other fashion wear.
Fashion Tampons.
Well, honey, I'm just gonna go on down and get me some.
Gee, Joyce, you look great today.
I like a woman who can accessorize.
Really turns me on.
Nice dress, Joyce.
This old rag?
Fashion Tampons.
Because at that time of the month, you want to look good.
[Woman] And there's also Fashion Maxi and Mini Pads... for the woman on the go.
Fashion Tampons from Femco.

[TV Reporter] Fighting broke out overnight between rival factions...
Honey, how's that roast coming along?
It's almost ready, dear.
- [Siren Wailing]
- Gee, Dad, that sounds close.
- Dad, it stopped right in front of the house!
- What's going on?
All right, everybody, let's all just calm down.
- I'll take care of this.
- [Knocking]
Nice to meet ya, folks.
Fire Marshal Bill here.
- Won't you come in?
- Don't mind if I do.
- Wow!
A real fireman!
- That's right, princess.
Say, you sure have a beautiful family here.
Why, thank you, Fire Marshal Bill.
How can we help you?
Well, it's National Fire Safety Week.
I've been going door to door lookin' for fire hazards.
Mind if I give your place a little inspection?
It's free.
Please do.
Son, does your father always smoke a pipe?
Yes, sir.
Pipes, cigarettes...
number one cause of domestic fires.
- Let me show you something.
- Certainly.
Now, say one night you're driftin' off to sleep on the couch... and the pipe falls out of your hand like that.
Now you start dreaming that you're havin' a little barbecue... you pull out a can of lighter fluid...
Boom!
You're off to the races.
- Fire!
- What, that?
Hey, Fire Marshal Bill, your finger's on fire!
That's nothin'.
I've caught fire so many times, I can't even feel it anymore.
The trick is not to panic.
Fire... is... your friend.
Uh-oh!
Look what I found.
[Family Coughing]
Down at the station, we like to call this an octopus.
Let me show you something.
Pull these out, it becomes an exposed electrical outlet.
Let's just say it's after dinner.
You've got a fork in your hand.
Somebody says, "Hey, a gaggle of geese!" Where?
Where?
[Screaming]
Fire Marshal Bill, are you okay?
Are you jokin'?
I've been hit by lightning 19 times.
That's horrible!
Not really.
I'm startin' to enjoy it.
Okay, everybody... out to the kitchen!
Now your kitchen area is an all too common locale... for fires.
First time I spontaneously combusted was in a kitchen not unlike this one.
It was one of those hot nights.
I opened the fridge, and boom!
Went up like a powder keg!
[Laughs]
Good thing I knew how to drop and roll.
- Your hand's on fire!
- So it is.
That's a sure sign that your gas flow hasn't been calibrated properly.
- [Water Hissing]
- Ahh!
Now...
Say you got yourself a bit of a virus.
You're lookin' for a box of tissues... but it's not there and it's too late.
[Sneezes]
Next thing you know, your gas light goes out on your new gas range.
Suddenly, your house is hit by a giant meteor storm that's totally unexpected.
One of those hot little babies comes right through the kitchen window... you just happen to be holding a match.
- Hey!
- You're not gonna light that, are you?
Don't worry, folks.
I'm a fire marshal.
[Explosion]
- [Crying]
- It's all gone, Mommy.
It'll be okay, sweetheart.
Everything we had was in there.
Come on, folks.
Let's move along.
You'll be all right.
[Coughing]
They just keep building 'em higher, don't they?
Hey!
Neighbor!
[Blows Whistle]
Is that a wood shingle roof you got there?
Let me show you somethin'!

Company, halt!
Okay, Woodpeckers, here we are.
At ease.
[Audience Cheering]
[Honking]
Welcome, all.
Welcome to Home E. Cheese, where a kid can be a kid... unless he get on my damn nerves.
Have a seat, little childrens.
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
That's, uh...
"Woodpecker," Mr. Cheese.
That's, uh, "Clown," Mr. Peckerwood.
Do you mind if I, uh... if I use a check for this?
- Oh, you want to pay me with a check, huh?
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
And have me stand in line in some damn bank in a clown outfit... degrading and shaming myself to cash your little peanuts, huh?
I don't think so.
Homey don't play that.
[Laughing]
See?
The little chickadees is having fun already.
I suppose you're right.
Okay!
Woodpeckers!
We rendezvous here at 1400 hours.
[Imitating Woody Woodpecker]
What the hell was that?
- Woodpecker call, sir.
- Yeah, all right.
Well, now that Mr. Uptight-and-white is gone, let's have some fun.
- Yeah!
- Who's the little birthday child?
I am, Homey!
I am!
Okay.
Then you get to wear this.
- Oh!
- [All] Ooh!
- The birthday hat.
- Thank you.
- So what do you wanna do first?
- Open my presents!
Oh, yeah, right.
Open up all your presents... while the rest of us stand here empty-handed, watching you have fun, huh?
Yeah!
I don't think so.
Homey don't play that.
You open that crap when you get home, Goldilocks.
- Okay, what's next?
- Oh, let's play some games, Homey.
Yeah!
Let's play some games!
Ooh!
You want to play some games, huh?
- Yeah!
- Yeah.!
Okay, let's play "Homey Says."
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
Okay, Homey says do like this.
And then Homey says put your hands like this.
And then Homey says close your eyes like this.
The end!
Wasn't that fun, childrens?
How about another game?
- Let's play a game of cards.
Any volunteers?
- Me, me, me.!
Okay, come with me, son.
What kind of cards are these?
It's called solitaire... confinement.
That's what you get for volunteering, stupid.
- Okay, y'all want birthday cake?
- Yeah!
We ain't got none.
We got cheese.
Government cheese.
Fresh baked this morning.
Let's sing the "Happy Birthday" song.
dd [Singing]
Okay, that's enough!
Who wants to cut the cheese?
All right.
I'll just save it for my 2:00 party.
Okay, childrens, line up.
It's time to sing the Home E. Cheese Wiz Kids song.
Come on out of jail, silly boy.
I'll hit you when I wanna hit you.
Come on.
Line up.
Let's keep it fun, childrens.
Yeah!

What have you done to the children?
I've showed them the light.
Okay, kids, let's go.
Fun's over.
Arm yourselves, Homettes!
As your Woodpecker leader, I am warning you.
I'm telling you to take those socks, put them away... and come with me to headquarters N-O-W.
Oh, yeah?
Go back to headquarters?
Yeah, so you can inspect our bunks?
- Yeah, and take away our candy?
- Yeah, and make us eat lima beans?
[Kids] We don't think so.
Home E. Cheese Wiz Kids don't play that!
[Imitating Woody Woodpecker]
Hey, uh, Homey, can I get my presents back?
- Oh, you want all your gifts back?
- Yes, please.
I don't think so.
Hmm.
I wonder where that 2:00 group of children is.
Thank you.
Thank you very much.
Before we go, I'd just like to introduce you to our newest Fly Girl, Carla Garrido.
[Cheering]
All right!
All right!
- Say good night, Carla.
- Good night!
- Say, "See you next week."
- See you next week.
She's gonna work out fine.
See you later.

[Announcer] Rocketed from a distant planet to a bold new destiny on Earth.
Found by a Kansas family and raised as Clark Kent, he learned he possessed the strength of steel, the speed of light and the desire to help all mankind.
He is Superboy.
All right, where are we?
"Children, close-up." Sure.
Master shot.
Nah, not so hot.
[footsteps]
All right.
[chains rattling]
OK, close-up, and that's that.
Jeez, lousy prop.
Don't they... [object thuds]
Oh!
Oh, jeez, Frank, you shouldn't come up on me like that.
I just had a bypass.
No, no, no.
- [growls]
- This isn't what I wanted.
It looks too '50s.
- It doesn't look real either.
- [growling] [chuckles] Well, what are you waiting for?
You go back and tell Max that I'm gonna buy him a hearing aid, so next time I ask him to do something, he'll do it.
Well, go on!
[growls]
Very funny.
- [growling]
- Hey!
Hey!
Hey!
[bones cracking] [yelling] [growling]
- Morning.
- Mm, hi.
Ready for another day of filing, faxing and brewing coffee?
If that's what they need.
I think they're threatened by us.
What do you mean?
They're afraid that if we go out into the field we'll do a better job than them.
Lana, I think they just want us to be a little more experienced first.
Do you really believe that?
No. [chuckles]
[Jackson] Kent!
Lang!
I've got something for you.
- The Lloyd case.
- The movie director?
Supposed to have been killed by some kind of a monster.
- I just filed that one.
- No, there was a witness.
You want me to file that, too?
No, I want the two of you to go out and interview him.
[Matt coughs]
Us?
- Or I could send Matt.
- No, no.
We'll do it.
Dennis, you are a real... [door unlocks]
- [Clark] Mrs. Watson?
- Yes.
I'm Clark Kent, this is Lana Lang.
We spoke to you earlier today.
Sure, about the monster.
Can we see your husband?
If you'd like to, but he's not the one you should be talking to.
Tommy, there's some people here to see you!
Thank you, Mr. Jackson.
My dad works at the studio.
He lets me come to work with him sometimes.
I'm going to be a director.
But Tommy, what about the monster?
Oh, yeah, like I was saying,
I heard this guy scream on Stage 21.
I looked in and I saw it.
The monster!
It was choking him like this.
Oh!
Tommy!
Tommy!
OK, OK.
And then it just ran away.
Did anybody else see it?
No, just me.
You don't believe me, do you?
- Tommy, it's just that we...
- I'll show you.
This is what I saw.
That's just from a movie.
It's not real.
Hey, I've got an IQ of 145,
I've skipped two grades in school, and I'm at advanced-expert level at "Turbo Kong."
I know if something's real or not.
- OK, but...
- What's your IQ?
[woman] It's beautiful, Milt, every word.
It made me cry real tears.
[chuckles] Yeah, you're wonderful.
Right, see you at the Oscars.
In your dreams.
- [man on phone] Yeah?
- Hello, Chuck?
- Yeah?
- It's Risa Owens.
- Uh-huh?
- Boy, do I need a rewrite.
- It's only a one pager.
- Uh-huh?
Milt really let me down this time.
He's old, is what he is!
Let me tell...
Hello?
Hello?
I'm trying to make a call here.
Take a number!
What is...
- [gurgling] - [screams]
[man] Yeah, that's mine.
So what?
Mr. Von Norman, two people have been killed.
One of them by something that looked like this thing.
This isn't a thing.
It's a man wearing makeup.
A man who's been in Vancouver all summer.
[Clark] Anybody can wear makeup.
That's a good point, that's what I told the police.
[Lana] The police?
You know, those guys in uniforms that investigate murders?
They came by a few days ago asking the same questions you're asking.
And what did you tell them?
I told them somebody broke into my house last month and stole some masks and prosthetics.
I thought it was a fan, but apparently it was some kind of psycho.
Maybe whoever it is is both.
It's a fine line in this business.
Doesn't it bother you that somebody's out there in your makeup killing people?
It would be, if people were dying.
But they are.
No.
They're producers and directors... not people.
[man] All right, everybody.
Quiet on the set!
- Ooh, a little bitter, huh?
- [man] Quiet, please!
Roll sound!
Action!
You see?
Machines can do almost anything.
Hmm, anything but lie and cheat and... [sighs] I'm sorry.
I forgot the line again.
[man] Cut!
Get me another one.
[man] Another cigarette for Mr. Melville.
Not the cigarette, the girl.
And make sure this one can act.
[squeals]
Well, at least it wasn't your fault this time.
It's hard to believe he's the same guy that does all those commercials for the South American orphans, huh?
Andy!
What are you doing here?
Well, it's a part-time job, but I figure in a year I'll be directing.
Only a year?
I'm gold at this place.
Hey, McAlister, what about that coffee!
I-I'm right on it.
That's what you said an hour ago.
He doesn't think you're gold.
Yeah, like he counts.
He's just a writer.
So what are you guys up to?
We're here to see Max Von Norman.
Yeah, Max?
He's the greatest.
He's such a happy guy, too.
It's an occupational hazard, you know?
Six months ago, he couldn't get arrested and now he's a genius.
[chuckles]
[instrumental music playing] [low growling]
Lisa?
Carrie?
Lisa and Carrie?
[growling] [gasping]
[low growling]
Oh!
Thanks a lot!
[laughing] [screaming]
- You all right?
- I don't know.
What was it?
It was a guy in a monster suit.
There!
I don't think that's a guy in a suit.
I'm gonna call security.
[growling]
[air rushing]
[woman] Oh, my God!
Watch out!
Watch out!
[crowd gasping]
It was real.
How did you know?
Just a hunch.
What was it?
Where did it come from?
All the police know is that thing killed Robin Melville.
Von Norman didn't have to kill it, Superboy had it down.
- Well, maybe he was afraid.
- For Superboy?
No, afraid that maybe we'd find out something
[Von Norman] "Best special effects in a horror film."
Do they think this can make up for all those years of abuse?
[chuckles] The humiliation?
The insults?
Do they think they can buy my friendship with this?
Six months ago I was dirt, now everybody wants me to work on their films.
To be at their parties, to have lunch with them.
[growls]
And I go along smiling, kissing their cheeks.
But all that stops tonight.
Caliban.
Where is Ajax?
Ajax, he was killed... [grunts] ...by Superboy.
[growling]
He was sent by the ones who are going to be here tonight.
No!
No more killing.
That was our bargain.
You do what I tell you to do, just like you did for my father.
Then...
Your father never asked us to kill for him.
That's it.
You wanna stop.
You wanna go back to where he found you?
Good, then let's go.
You've got a busy day.
Up to about six months ago, Max's stuff was terrible.
Make a list:
Lowry, Lou Lloyd, Risa Owens...
Owens and Lloyd were both murdered.
Oh, forget it.
If Max was going around trying to kill he'd need an A-bomb.
Besides, everybody loves him now.
He just turned it around.
All of a sudden his stuff became a lot more realistic.
As good as anything his dad ever did.
Look, I wanna show you this other project.
How can you not remember where you saw a monster?
I see them day and night.
I see them in my dreams.
It's easy to lose track.
Boy, you shoulda seen that fight last night.
That thing was almost as strong as Superboy.
Really?
Yep, but for once someone else got to be the hero.
Max turned it into a pile of ashes.
He suddenly jumps out with this flamethrower.
Hey, Lana!
We're gonna go look at some tapes.
[Clark] Andy thinks he saw the monster before.
- You saw it before?
- Yeah, I'm sure of it.
I'd like to see them but...
She's going to Von Norman's party with me.
Von Norman's party?
I wasn't invited to that.
[Clark] I hope these tapes help you remember.
Yep, it's going to be just like Saturday nights
You, me and the VCR.
- I'll go get the pizza.
- All right.
[piano playing]
Hey!
Oh, ladies' room.
That's what they always say. [sighs]
[scary music playing] [woman screaming, monster growling]
I knew I'd seen you somewhere before.
[knocking on door]
Yeah, Clark, come on in.
[door opens]
I think I found our monster.
[growling]
[door creaks]
[Von Norman] Miss Lang.
Here for a preview?
[gasps]
Andy, it's Clark.
[sniffs] I got the pizzas.
Andy?
"Special monster effects by Max Von Norman, Jr."
[air rushing]
This is what all the others are going to get.
- Only you're going to be first.
- [yelps]
What is it?
I've always been afraid to ask that question.
[gasping] What's back there?
Kind of like a different dimension,
That's why his monsters always looked so real.
They were real.
Get him!
He killed Ajax!
[gurgling]
Stop...
or he dies.
[growling]
Go, my friend.
You are free to go.
What are you doing?
You lied!
Superboy didn't kill Ajax!
Wait, Caliban, I can explain.
Ask him!
He saw!
No wait!
Wait!
No!
Stop!
Where did they go?
Movie magic.
"There's no one" I feel safe with except my lifeguard.
I don't want to let go of you.
"Looks like she put you" right in the middle of a double cross.
I don't believe any of this.
Don't?
Or don't want to?
You saved my life.
That's an attachment, isn't it?
This lady is with two guys in two days and they both end up dead.
Now she's with Mitch.
Why don't you come with me.
You saved my life, too.
Now we belong to each other.
"You have no idea where" this is going to end.
What are you waiting for?
The sun's almost up.
I feel alive for the first time in years.
Kiss me underwater.
So why don't you bring Kim?
Kelly.
Her name's Kelly.
Whatever.
No chemistry.
No chemistry?
!
What's wrong with her?
She was gorgeous.
She was gorgeous, but there's no chemistry.
Aw, Mitch, you know what your problem is?
Since your divorce, you've become cautious.
I got Hobie to consider.
I don't want him getting attached to anybody I'm not serious about.
Oh, he can handle it.
I think you're the one who's afraid of getting attached.
Sooner or later, you're gonna have to open up.
Call it in.
Ransom, take it!
Rescue in progress.
Car submerged off Tower 19.
Repeat, 10-25, Tower 19.
That's good.
Spit it out.
That's good.
Okay, okay.
Yeah, take it easy.
Take it easy.
Is he dead?
Is he dead?
No!
No!
I'm sorry.
How's everything?
Well, she's a lucky lady.
How you feeling?
Okay.
Mind if I check your pulse?
Strong.
I'm sure every woman's pulse is strong when you take it.
I don't know about that.
But I do need to know some information about what happened on the road back there.
Um...
Steve was driving me to the marina, to my boat.
Can you give me specific information?
I mean, there was no I. "D... "
Um, I know.
He was...
He was going to the beach right after.
Steve was, uh...
We were in business together.
He was my partner.
Anyway...
I don't really know what happened.
I must have dozed off in the passenger seat, and before I knew it, water was rushing in all over the place.
I'm sorry.
Oh, no.
It's okay.
Uh...
Can bring you something, Miss, uh?
Allison, please.
Um, coffee would be nice.
Okay.
Oh, unfortunately, there are some procedures that have got to be done before we can release you.
Like what?
Well, a police report, for one.
There's an officer waiting for you upstairs.
Oh, uh...
I don't think I'm really up to it today.
Do you think it could wait till tomorrow?
Please?
I'll see what I can do.
Thanks.
Okay.
Thanks for everything.
Cream and sugar?
Black.
Okay.
She gave me all the information she could remember, so I put it all in this report.
She's still pretty shaken up.
From what Shauni tells me, "pretty" is the operative word.
Pretty doesn't even come close.
You gave her mouth-to-mouth.
You ought to know.
I gave you mouth-to-mouth once, too.
Believe me, it ain't the same as kissing.
I know, I know.
So you'll do me a favor, wait till tomorrow?
Sure, this ought to suffice for now.
Coroner just picked up John Doe.
Says here his name's Steven Pierce.
Well, Mr. Pierce is one weird corpse.
Why is that?
He was sucking up water like a vacuum.
Mitch, he was drowning out before we even had a chance to resuscitate him.
So, uh... how's the lady?
Well, she's pretty distraught, but she came through the whole thing okay.
She must have a guardian angel.
Ready?
Definite chemistry.
What?
Do you suppose there's any way
I can get my stuff before tomorrow?
No, we can't get a crane to lift it out till then.
Well, what if somebody saw the crash and they dive down and try to steal my things?
Don't worry, nobody's going to get in there.
The trunk is wedged against the bottom.
Come on.
Yep, yep.
You all right?
Yeah.
I guess getting in a car again and driving up the coast...
I think I'm scared.
That's okay.
I'll drive slow.
What am I going to do when you drop me off and leave?
Is there somebody you can call?
No, no one I feel safe with... except my lifeguard.
I don't want to let go of you.
It's going to be pretty hard to drive this way.
Sorry.
It's okay.
It'll be all right.
This is where you live?
I only wish it was mine.
It belongs to another investor.
He's on a photo safari in Africa.
He's letting me stay here.
Come on in.
Make yourself comfortable.
Thanks.
I'll be right back.
Whew.
Operator, Pacific Palisades.
Can you connect me to Westview Patrol?
Hi.
There's a man outside... 12973
Horizon drive.
He's been sitting in his car for a couple of hours.
Would you mind sending someone over to check it out, please?
Thank you.
How do you like the view?
It's absolutely gorgeous.
I'll get us some drinks.
I'll be right down.
Okay.
My dad taught me to sail.
We used to run transpacs to Hawaii.
I once raced single-handed to the Farallons and back.
- Now your boat's in the marina?
- Mm-hmm.
Obsession.
That's her name, and she is.
I'd like to take her around the world, though.
By yourself?
Not necessarily.
Tell me why a man like you is still a lifeguard.
Most people hate to go to work.
I don't.
I know what you mean.
That's why I decided to go into business for myself.
No partners and no bosses.
What about your investors?
Well, I've already paid back one of them.
And when I pay back the other,
I'll have complete and total freedom.
No attachments... to anyone.
What do they say in China?
You saved my life, so you belong to me, or I belong to you?
I think it's "you belong to me. "
Well, that's an attachment, isn't it?
You know, there's some swimsuits in the bathhouse.
Do you ever swim just for fun?
I think it's time for me to leave.
Why?
You said your son was with his mother all week.
Yeah, I know.
I just don't like starting something when I know where it's going to end.
Trust me... you have no idea where this is going to end.
Hey, lifeguard.
What are you waiting for?
Mitch, Mitch.
There's someone in the house.
What?
!
I heard a noise in the living room.
Well, could it be the owners?
Not without calling.
Please go and see who it is.
Okay, okay.
Mitch, be careful.
Okay, just wait for me.
I'll be right back.
Are you okay?
Yeah.
I'm okay.
Did I kill him?
Shot him right through the heart.
He's dead.
Hey, now...
Probably saved a thousand lives before, but that's the first time anybody's ever saved me.
Oh, God, if you weren't here, it would have been me dead on the floor.
You know who he is?
Yes.
He's my ex-husband.
When I left him, he threatened to kill me.
Is that why you wanted me here... to protect you?
No.
I didn't even know he followed me to Los Angeles.
But I did know that I'd be safe with you.
Where are you going?
I'm going to call the police.
Mitch, wait.
Before you call, can we talk about this a second?
Um, what if the police say that I shot my husband... that I murdered him?
Your husband or your ex-husband?
Ex-husband.
Well, they won't.
He broke in.
He had a gun.
He was about to shoot me.
You had no choice.
Allison, I've got to call the police... so if there's anything
I should know before I do, tell me now.
No.
I've told you everything.
Okay.
Mitch, you shouldn't get involved in this.
You should go.
I'll call them.
There's no need to get involved.
I am involved.
Hey, you forgot.
You saved my life, too.
Now we belong to each other.
So what else did Detective Connors say?
That's it.
Mitch stayed with her at the police station for most of the night, and then he said he was taking her back to his house.
Not gonna press charges?
No, apparently not.
Don't you think that's a little weird?
What?
Well, this lady is with two guys in two days, and they both end up dead.
Now she's with Mitch.
I think this is the most wonderful time I've ever had.
And you are the most genuine, most passionate man
I've ever met.
Allison, I think I'm falling...
Mitch, please don't.
Mitch, I have to say good-bye.
What?
I'm sorry, Mitch.
If things were different...
Where are you going?
South on "Obsession. "
Maybe Mexico, Brazil.
Somewhere far away from everything here.
Including me?
Why don't you come with me?
You know I can't come with you.
You once said you didn't want to start something when you knew where it would end.
You were right.
If you come with me, we'll be too much in love to say good-bye.
Let's just say it now, while we still can.
Oh!
So, when Eddie voiced his suspicions,
I had the coroner reexamine the body.
Now, Steve Pierce drowned all right, but not in the ocean.
His lungs were filled with chlorinated water.
See, he was already dead when that car was driven off the cliff.
Maybe he was swimming before the crash and swallowed some water.
He did...
enough to drown.
Tell him about the wrist.
Yeah, there were marks on his wrist that indicated he'd been handcuffed before he died.
That's right, then I found handcuffs in her suitcase.
What the hell were you doing looking through her suitcase?
I didn't trust her.
- So you went through her things.
Fellas...
Mitch, she was using you to protect her.
Her ex-husband was trying to kill her!
It wasn't her ex-husband!
It was her partner.
That's right.
He was a con man named Drew Lawrence.
Looks like she put you right in the middle of a double cross.
I don't believe any of this.
Don't?
Or don't want to?
You know, I have to bring her in for questioning.
She saved my life.
She's the one who put you in danger in the first place.
Where is she, Mitch?
What's taking Connors so long?
Do me a favor and check on him, will you?
Hey, Mitch!
Sorry!
This is something I got to do myself.
Lower your sails.
Go back, Mitch.
Don't make this harder than it already is.
I said lower your sails.
I'm coming aboard.
Sit down.
Did Steven Pierce drown in the swimming pool... yes or no?
Yes.
Oh!
Was he handcuffed?
Yes.
He killed himself, Mitch.
He killed himself because I told him I wouldn't marry him.
I went out to the pool and he'd already handcuffed himself to the bottom rung of the ladder.
I panicked.
He was married.
We had an affair.
It ended.
I didn't know what else to do.
I put his body in the car.
I was going to bury him at sea.
I got scared, and I started to cry.
That's when I drove the car off the cliff.
So everything from the beginning's been a lie, huh?
Everything?
No, not everything.
Not the way I feel about you.
That's not a lie.
I've come to take you back, Allison.
I won't go.
If you're telling the truth, you got nothing to be afraid of.
What do you know about fear?
What do you know about being manipulated by people who want to control you?
A hell of a lot more now than I did a few days ago.
I will never let another man run my life.
Not even you.
I don't want to kill you, Mitch, but I will.
Same way you shot your partner?
Through the heart?
You learned a lot in a short time.
What did the two of you con Steve Pierce out of, anyway?
Was it money?
Real estate?
You're making it harder to let you go, Mitch.
Aw.
As hard as it was when you said your tearful good-bye?
Wow.
What a performance.
Please don't make me do this.
Wouldn't you rather put a handcuff on my wrist?
Drown me?
I'll shoot.
I promise I will.
I don't believe you.
You all right?
Yeah.
Do I still belong to you, Mitch?
No.
You belong to him.
Let's go.
Mitch...
Is this the way you thought it would end?
No.
What are you doing?
I want to see what's in here.
So this is what it was all about.
I guess so.

Therefore, I am, I must.
I don't understand a word you're saying.
What kind of language is that?
It is the tongue of my native land, Dyslexia.
Now, say you'll be my bride.
And together we will rule the Erudites.

You are brave as well as beautiful.
That excites me.
You shall never taste my ambrosia, Kee-Man.

We are gathered here to bid farewell to a great blues singer.
- Amen.
- Mississippi "Fat Back" Witherspoon.
Fat Back!
Now, he-he wanted this to be a joyous occasion.
He didn't want us carrying on.
So I present his friend, Mr. Calhoun Tubbs.
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Reverend.
Look here.
No disrespect to the family... but, uh, Calhoun's 900 Greatest Hits is available on eight-track cassette in the lobby.
$3.95.
Of course, you get a complimentary copy, son.
You know, Fat Back wanted this to be a joyous occasion... so I thought I might sing a few songs, tell some funny stories about my good friend.
Now, you all know Fat Back loved him some catfish.
- Amen.
- I say, Fat Back loved him some catfish.
- Amen.
- The only thing he loved more than some of that channel cat... was that little baby girl child.
Lord, that girl could cook.!
You know, she done cooked some catfish for him the day he died.
Wrote a song about it.
Like to hear it?
Here it go.
d Fat Back choked on a catfish d d That stupid girl fed him the bone dd
- [Sobbing]
- Thank you very much.
Now, don't get me wrong now.

He loved that boy.
Wrote a song about it.
Like to hear it?
Here it go.
d Fat Back's wife wasn't nothin' but a skank tramp d d She had a bastard child dd

You know, I'd like to thank y'all for letting me take time... to share these few loving memories about my good old buddy Fat Back.
You know, he was always thinking about his wife and family.
But he lived just for today.
That's kind of like what made him so special.
Wrote a song about it.
Like to hear it?
Here it go.
d Fat Back ain't had no life insurance d d You're about to lose the house and car dd
Now that's the second standing ovation I ever got.
Thank you very much.

- dd ['80s Pop] - [Announcer] And now...
Public Access Television Channel 53 presents:
Men on Vacation.
- Hello.
I'm Blayne Edwards.
- And I'm Antoine Merryweather.
[In Unison] And welcome to Men on Vacation.
Today we'll be reviewing our little European vacation.
From a male point of view.
Here we are on our last stop on our whirlwind gallivant through Europa.
Wait a minute.
We got a new sponsor.
Somebody better check their mail.
Tonight's broadcast is brought to you byJewels... the gum that explodes in your mouth.
I bet you just can't chew one.
And who'd want to?
We started our little trip in Greece.
The Greek peoples was so nice.
Yes.
They bent over backwards to show us a good time.
Oh, look.
Excuse me.
Not you, fish.
You go back in the sea.
Garcon.
Oh, may I have another Wallbanger?
- And for monsieur?
- Oui, oui.
- Bottoms up.
- Ditto.
Is that little Ricky Schroder?
What's he doin' here?
Don't let him see me.
- Who's that with him?
- You know, I think that's Erik Estrada.
Oh, well.
Anyway.
Next we went to Holland, land of dikes.
[In Unison] Hated it!
And from there, it was on to merry old England.
- Remember Big Ben?
- Oh, how could I forget it?
It was so nice of him to show us around the city.
Excuse me.
Big Ben was a clock.
Well, we both know what time that was.
You'd better stop.
You know, it's so chilly out here, my nipples are hard.
Then it was just a hop, skip and jump on to gay Paris... but we decided to go back to Greece instead.
And then it was on to Scotland.
You know, I found it to be quite an open society... where mens are free to explore the feminine side of their nature.
All those hairy legs and skirts holding' them bagpipes.
Mm-hmm.
Not since the Fire Island Halloween Barn Dance... have I seen so many men in drag.
Just a hint, fellas:
Plaid is out this fall.
Our next stop was Sweden, best known for its beautiful, buxom blondes.
[In Unison] Hated it!
So we went back to Greece.
But it was very sad when we had to leave our soldier buddies behind... and travel to our final destination:
The French Riviera... which is where we've been ever since.
Oh, yes.
And to sum up our little European vacation, we're gonna have... to give the whole trip a new and improved around-the-world-and-back snap.
Tell a friend.
Tune in next week, when we'll be back in the good old U.S. Of A... reviewing the new release, Memphis Belle.
It's the story of 10 young mens in leather jackets... all sweaty, standin' next to each other... and them long, hard bombs crammed together in a little old cockpit.
Well, grease my landing gear.
I'm coming in for a landing.
- Toodle-oo!
- See you next week!
Bye!
dd ['80s Pop]
Next!
Listen, do you mind if I go first?
I've got to get back to the stock exchange before 4:00.
Oh, sure, let you go embezzle your millions... while I struggle to get by off of minimum wage.
I don't think so.
Homey don't play that.
- Sit down.
- I don't feel like it.
I said sit down!
- Name.
- Homey D. Clown.
Oh, yes.
Herman Simpson.
We know all about you.
I'm Sally.
I'm your new parole officer.
- What's that, Sally?
- It's your file.
Let's see. " Abusive language, failure to perform prescribed..."
Save your breath.
That's just another long list of lies... perpetrated by the man to keep a brother down.
Clown, please.
Let's place the blame where it belongs.
I believe your anti-social behavior is the real problem.
I'll tell you what the real problem is.
- The real problem is you're nothing but a tool of the man.
- You are living in a fantasy.
- Another oppressor.
- You wanna blame everybody but yourself!
- You want to break the rules and stay out of jail!
- You don't care about me!
[In Unison] I don't think so.
dd [Melodramatic Classical]
[Snaps]
[Clown Horn Honking]
[Horn Continues Honking]
- Yeah!
- It's Homey the clown!
- Hey, Homey, does your nose squeak?
- Girl, don't touch my nose.
- Hey, clowny, do a stupid clown trick.
- Yeah!
- I'd love to.
- Herman!
- Come on.!
- Yeah, come on.!
Okay, childrens.
Just one stupid clown trick.
- Yeah!
- Yea!
Look at Homey's flower.
Smell Homey's flower.
[Squeals]
- [Laughing]
- Okay, run along, little children.
See?
He's a stupid weak clown.
Now, that's more like the Herman I want to see.
He kicked me in my behind, honey.
Oh, that's all right.
Because you're starting to act like a real person.
By the way, Mama's coming over on Monday.
And Wednesday you start your new job.
But I got a job, honey bunch.
I'm a clown, remember?
You're not a clown.
You're a buffoon.
I'm talking about a real job, Herman.
An entry level position at that fancy new restaurant I told you about.
- Not Chez Whitey.
- Yes.
Look.
It's high time you stopped playing the fool.
Get yourself out of that ridiculous outfit and into a regular suit.
You know, Herman, I can just picture it.
You wearing one of those nice little red valetjackets.
If you're faithful and humble... and do exactly what the man tells you... that means no hostility... they might even let you inside the restaurant.
The time has come for you to fit into society.
Come on, Herman, give it up and join the establishment.
- The establishment, huh?
- Yes.
You want me to put on a little monkey suit and park cars for the man, huh?
Maybe if I do real good, I can move up to washing dishes.
Then maybe waiting tables.
Who knows?
Maybe five or six years later...
I'll be able to seat Whitey himself.
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- Yes, Herman, I would.
I don't think so.
Homey don't play that.
- I'm telling Daddy.
- Good.
Give him this when you see him.
Hmm.
Now, I wonder where those sweet little childrens went.
There he is!
I told you he'd still be here.
Hey, uh...
Hey, clown man, do another trick for us, will ya?
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
- Another clown trick, huh?
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
So you can fall down laughing while I degrade and shame myself for your amusement, huh?
- [Children In Unison] Yeah!
- You'd like that, wouldn't you?
- Yeah!
- Yeah!
Homey!
Homey!
Homey!
Homey!
Homey!
- Homey!
- Sit down!
Gather round, little chickadees.
Homey's got a little love story to tell you.
- Ooh!
- Now, which one of you kicked me in my behind earlier?
- He did!
- Me!
- Okay, you get up here and be my assistant.
- Yeah!
Hey!
Now, once upon a time... two lonely hearts came together.
- Woo woo.
- Wow.
- Just like this.
Then love poured all out from their hearts... nice and thick-like.
Until Homey realized... that it was just a trick to whiten him up, like so.
And it made his heart beat over and over and over again.
The end.
So, what has our little lesson taught us if nothing else, childrens?
[Children In Unison] Homey don't play that.
Very good.
Now, let's sing a little Homey love song.
- You do backup for me, would you?
- Yeah.!
- d Love is bad d - d Bad d
- d Love is sad d - [Children In Unison] d Sad d
- d Love ain't glad d - d Glad d d Love is something you wish you never had d d 'Cause love takes your heart and kicks it around the room d d Then it tries to set you up and send you to jail d
d It'll make you unhappy for the rest of your life d
- I said back me up.
- dd [Singing Haphazardly] dd [Haphazard Singing Continues]
Hey, hey.!
Hey.!
The white girl is offbeat.
The end.
[Whines] dd [Theme]
dd [Man Vocalizing, Indistinct]
d You can do what you wanna do in living colordd
- Put it down here.
- All right.
Five bucks.
Taking off already?
Yeah, I gotta get home.
- Dinner with Mom.
- Yeah.
I had a mother once.
Hey, your game's getting pretty solid, McKay.
Well, thanks.
What's the damage?
- Let's see.
Three hours, right?
- Yep.
That'll be 1 5 bucks.
You know, McKay, you're about the last guy who'd ever struck me as being a mama's boy.
Hey, you hurry back, McKay, huh?
We'll be here.
Dylan, honesty is the key.
You have to tell your mom how you feel.
Get it out on the table.
Forget that psychobabble, Kelly.
That only works for deep-seated emotional crises.
Parents are another problem.
You tell her whatever she wants to hear, and then do what you want.
Parents are oblivious anyway.
It's not like we all come from what you'd call your normal, stable family backgrounds.
I mean, look what I've been through with mine, booze and drugs.
Our households aren't exactly Walsh heaven.
Hey, leave our parents out of this.
We should all be so lucky.
I just can't hang with a 24-hour live-in mom.
You'll get used to it, pal.
I don't think so.
I'm worried about him.
Come on, Bren.
I've seen him go through worse.
Yeah, but he's ditched school all week.
- He's been really moody.
- He's always moody.
Besides, moms are supposed to drive you crazy.
Yeah, well, Iris McKay is certainly doing a good job of that.
- Have you met her yet?
- No.
But I just can't wait.
Three weeks ago, when school started and you enrolled into lntro to Economics, who thought that some of you would get so rich so quickly?
Go ahead and pass these back, please.
Let's see here.
Steve, biotechs are doing very nicely.
Kelly, you caught ibm at the bottom.
Nice.
David, you went out on a limb with the entertainment issues.
But I must say, the most well-rounded portfolio, the one with the highest return,
- is yours, Donna.
- Me?
I had you choose this imaginary portfolio of stocks to show you how the stock market works.
But I must say, Donna, you have a real knack for this.
Your picks are keeping pace with some of the best mutual funds in the country.
Well, if anybody can spot a bargain, Donna can.
Next time.
Guys, guys, guys, why are we jerking around with make-believe?
- What are you talking about?
- Let's do it for real.
- How real?
- We've all got something stashed.
- Birthday presents, Christmas.
- You're crazy.
My dad lost his shirt in the stock-market crash of '87.
And I like my shirt, okay?
Yeah.
My mom dated a broker once.
My money stays in the bank.
Guys, no guts, no glory.
Show them what you're made out of.
- Let's take free enterprise for a ride.
- l don't know.
Donna, you're great at this.
If we'd been playing for real, we would've made a bundle off your picks.
Donna, don't be stupid.
Steve's right.
You heard Mr. Slater.
I'm good at this.
That was fantasyland.
Well, it doesn't have to be.
So I'm thinking of going blond again.
Or maybe bald, you know, go for that Sinead look.
- What?
- You haven't heard a word I've said.
I'm sorry, I just-- l got something else on my mind.
Yeah, your mother.
I don't wanna talk about it, Bren.
Well, I do.
Dylan, I can't stand to see you so miserable.
What is she doing here?
Who?
That's my mother's car.
Here?
Yeah.
She's either looking for me or she's in there reading your mom's palm.
Well, Bren, looks like you finally get to meet the mamacita.
You rub your hands like that, and truly, you can feel the earth pulsate.
Really.
- Hi.
- Hi.
Iris, what are you doing here?
I called looking for you and Cindy invited me over.
- Hope you don't mind.
- Why should I?
Dylan, aren't you going to introduce us?
Yeah.
Brenda, this is Iris.
Iris, Brenda.
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you, Brenda.
Actually, I already know a lot about you.
You're strong-willed, loving and intensely loyal, aren't you?
Yeah.
That's just about right.
But your astrological chart didn't reveal how pretty you are.
Thanks.
You know, your mom and I have a lot in common, Dylan.
- You do?
- Oh, yes, we're children of the '60s.
Where have all the flower children gone?
Gone to power children.
Yuppies.
Yeah.
Life was a lot simpler when you could still thumb a ride anywhere in the world.
Mom, did you hitchhike?
Well, across campus.
Does Dad know?
Those were the days, huh, Bren?
Too bad we missed out on all the fun.
Listen, Brenda, why don't you help me set the table?
Dylan and his mom are staying for dinner.
We are?
One thousand three hundred thirty-one dollars and fourteen cents.
About to be flushed right down the drain.
It's my money, Kelly.
I can do what I want with it.
I'd like to close my account.
- Can I see some id?
- Oh, sure.
- One moment, please.
- Okay.
Donna, you worked so hard for this money.
Just think of how long it takes for a whole year to go by before you get to another birthday, and all the bribes for good grades.
And the babysitting money?
Remember how scared you get being home alone in somebody else's house late at night?
Donna, don't blow it.
And don't let Steve talk you into this, okay?
How do you want it?
- ln an envelope?
- l meant, big bills, small bills?
Oh, whatever you've got.
Seeing on how she's just planning on throwing it away anyway.
Why are you trying to ruin this?
Somebody has to.
Donna, you're just being stupid.
One hundred, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1 ,000, 1 00, 200, 300, 20, $31 and 1 4 cents.
Thank you.
Might as well just go ahead and give me that 1 4 cents.
Because that's all you're gonna have left when this thing's over.
I can't believe how L.A. has changed since I left.
I mean, take Melrose.
In 1 980, it was all low-rent auto-parts and hardware stores.
Paved paradise and put up a parking lot.
Not Hana, though.
That is my little piece of heaven.
- Oh, Maui sounds so beautiful.
- Just tell me when you're ready.
I have a tree house sitting on top of a pineapple mountain.
Right, Dylan?
It's paradise.
So, Iris, what did you do for work in Hawaii?
I sold T-shirts on the beach.
And I joined an archaeological expedition.
But mostly, I just mellowed.
Mellowed?
It's a great place to drop your inhibitions, Jim, you know.
Grow a beard.
Swim naked.
How alternative.
Oh, come on, Dad, let's do it.
Let's just drop out for a while.
A couple of weeks in Hawaii doesn't sound bad to me right now.
It is a magical place.
You should have seen Dylan when he was there.
It even mellowed him out.
It didn't mellow me out.
I was bored out of my gourd.
Cindy, did I tell you what the psychic told me
- about my son when he was little?
- Please.
Dylan, it's no big deal.
I told you I don't wanna hear it.
Excuse me.
Dylan, wait.
Sweetheart, chill out.
I will, outside.
Excuse me.
That woman is driving me up the wall, Bren.
Dylan, I'm sure she's not trying to.
She's probably just trying to be a mom.
Well, I wish she wouldn't try so hard.
Remember a couple of weeks ago when we went on that camping trip?
You were complaining that she didn't care enough.
I mean, which is it, Dylan?
I don't know anymore.
Look, just calm down.
I'm sure she means well.
I can't.
She's here to stay and there's not a damn thing I can do about it.
Dylan, it's getting late.
Good little boys have to go to bed early on a school night.
Thank you so much for dinner, for everything.
- l feel I've found a real friend.
- Me too.
Good night.
Good night, Brenda.
You are a magical young lady.
Nice meeting you.
- l'll call you later.
- Bye.
I don't know.
I thought she was a little...
Eccentric be the right word?
I think the word is weird.
I don't know, I kind of liked her.
Me too.
Felt like I'd known her for years.
Mom, it must have been in another life.
Brenda.
No, look, it doesn't matter what any of us think of Iris, anyway.
She's driving Dylan nuts.
Dylan, how long have you been seeing Brenda?
Why?
Well, you may not notice it, but she has an extremely negative aura.
What?
Nothing like Cindy.
In fact, it's hard to believe that they are mother and daughter.
Cindy is so spiritual and Brenda is...
Well, such a Scorp.
A Scorpio.
You're a Libra.
You are totally wrong for each other.
I don't wanna argue, so I'm only gonna say this one time.
Brenda Walsh, my relationship with her, are none of your business.
Do you understand me?
Well, excuse me.
Where are you going?
It's almost midnight.
Don't wait up.
- Hey, McKay.
- How you doing?
Bobby Falcone been looking for you.
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.
You must be getting pretty good if Falcone wants to play you.
Well, you know...
Hey, can I get you something?
Yeah, whatever you got on tap will be fine.
You got it, you got it.
Hey, man, you don't have to flash that fake id every time you come in here, you know.
- Thanks, man.
- Yeah, no problem.
Hey, you want a shot with that?
Sure, why not?
You got it.
Brandon, give me that headline again.
"West Beverly swimmers claim victory."
Subhead: "Beverly Hills sinks."
Okay, got it.
- Great.
Slug it in.
- Okay.
Brandon, what would I do without you?
You guys, I've got to talk to you.
Brenda, we're about to put the paper to bed.
Okay, what is it?
Dylan has flipped out.
He ditched school again today.
That's the third time this week.
- Where does he go all day?
- l don't know.
He won't tell me.
He says his mother is driving him crazy.
Brenda, it's his problem.
Brenda, there's probably nothing we can do but listen.
You're already doing that.
Yeah, I guess.
is his mom really that bad?
- No.
- Yes.
Oh, come on, Brandon.
She's a space case.
- So she's a little flaky.
- A little?
Do you know what she's doing today?
She took our mother to a mind gym.
A mind gym?
- Hey, Brandon.
- Yeah?
What's with Dylan?
He doesn't look so good.
I don't know.
is it Brenda again?
No. I think it's his mother.
He's got a mother?
Well, not your garden-variety, average mom.
But, yeah, sure, he's got one.
When you skip school three days in a row, I worry about you.
I was just blowing off some steam.
I'll be back tomorrow.
Where were you?
Around.
I'm fine, Bren.
You don't look fine, Dylan.
Here you go, guys.
Dylan, how you doing?
I am fine.
See, he's fine.
What'd I tell you?
Dylan, remember, there's a trig test first period tomorrow.
Already?
If you wanna study together, why don't you come over after dinner?
Like around 8, okay?
And I'll get you through it.
Sure.
Listen, I gotta go.
Dylan, wait a second.
What?
Are you sure you're okay?
Bye, Bren.
Good?
I feel like I'm floating.
Now, this is my favourite.
Ginger, garlic, orange.
Thanks.
Sounds strong.
Try it.
You get a real rush from the garlic.
I'll say.
Natural high.
So how long before the bliss fades and I turn back into a mom?
I guarantee it'll last at least through dinner.
Do you come here a lot?
Once, twice a week.
I just get so fried.
Tell me the truth.
Do your kids actually talk to you?
Brenda and Brandon?
Most of the time, I can't shut them up.
Well, Dylan takes after his father, you know?
Dylan's had a tough time of it lately.
Well, I don't need to tell you.
Maybe you do.
You probably know him better than I do.
No, I didn't mean that.
No, I know, I know.
I appreciate your friendship.
You know, from what I remembered of Beverly Hills, I expected to be treated like a pariah for having walked out on my son.
I'm not judging you, Iris.
I know.
Well, let me tell you, it's not what you think.
No.
I can't erase the past.
But maybe I can do something about the future.
Yes, I think we'll start with the beluga caviar and the blini.
And, I don't know, Donna, how does the Chateaubriand sound to you?
- Perfect.
- Great.
And, of course, a bottle of your best champagne.
- What's with you guys?
- We're rich.
Right.
Three days ago we bought some stock and it went up.
Up?
It went through the roof!
It exploded!
Steve, that's just the paper profits.
To make some money, we need to sell.
Sell?
Sell?
Donna, haven't you ever heard of equity?
Give yourself some credit.
You're a genius, Donna.
She may look like a dumb blond, but she's the wizard of Wall Street.
Winners?
Mr. Falcone.
Nine ball.
Over there.
I just won.
So the prince of Beverly Hills wants to lose some money, huh?
If you say so.
How's 50 a game sound?
Sounds good.
Lag for break?
After you.
What is this?
It is so spicy, I can't even eat it.
It's a place that Dylan's mother recommended in West Hollywood called Pakistani Palace.
- lt is a little hot.
- Oh, Jim, it's not hot. lt's invigorating.
I'm beginning to see stars.
Could you pass the water, please?
Now Iris has you going off the deep end, doesn't she?
Now, Brenda, there's nothing wrong with trying something new.
You know, if she's such a free spirit, why can't she lighten up on Dylan?
Because she's his mother.
And whether he likes it or not, he's her responsibility.
From what she's been telling me, he hasn't made it easy for her either.
Well, maybe not.
But she's got Dylan wound up like a spring.
I mean, if she doesn't back off, he's gonna snap.
Guess that's an ace.
Yeah.
Pretty good.
Well, that's it for me tonight, rich kid.
Anytime, Falcone, anytime.
Brenda?
It's okay, Mom. lt's just Dylan.
Do you know what time it is?
You were supposed to be here at 8:00.
I'm sorry, Bren.
Forgive me.
You've been drinking.
I'm a big boy.
is this what you meant by "blowing off steam"?
Oh, lighten up, Bren.
I'm under control.
No, you're not, Dylan.
Look at you.
So where do your parents keep the liquid?
Are you crazy?
My parents will hear you.
I'm sorry.
What, no Scotch?
I just want a shot.
Dylan, don't do this.
Brenda, I already have one woman in my life who thinks she's my mother, okay?
Damn it, Dylan, if you are going to drink, get the hell out of my house.
I thought I could count on you.
Thanks for listening.
Brandon, that was Dylan downstairs.
He was drunk.
Oh, no.
He got into the liquor cabinet, and I threw him out.
- Did I screw up?
- No.
He's been clean for so long.
Not exactly.
What do you mean?
It was on the camping trip, I didn't wanna tell you.
What?
It was just a couple little airline bottles of booze.
I didn't wanna make a big deal of it.
Brandon, it is a big deal.
Dylan's a recovering alcoholic.
Yes, I'm aware of that, Brenda, thank you.
It's his mother's fault.
She's driving him crazy.
You think his mother's driving him to drink, Bren?
Come on.
Life's a little more complicated.
You and I don't go get drunk every time we have a fight with Mom and Dad.
Yeah, well, he was fine until she got here.
Maybe.
But she's not the one pouring booze down his throat.
At some point in every investor's experience comes a moment of truth.
You've made some money on a stock.
Do you sell or do you hold?
Steve, it's time to unload.
What are you, crazy?
We're on a roll.
We tripled our money.
Let's get out.
Donna, perhaps you'd like to share this with the rest of us?
I don't think so.
Why not?
She's the big expert.
Okay.
I just don't think that when someone buys stock, they should get greedy.
You make a profit, you get out.
Steve?
Well, what if you get out too soon and miss out on a major jump?
Well, it's like the song says:
"You gotta know when to hold them, know when to fold them."
You're out of here.
- You're wimping out on me.
- l am not.
I'm taking a profit.
An honest profit.
- Yeah?
- lt's the way of the game.
Well, Bernie says hold out.
He says the major players are trying to scare out the little people like us.
And they're gonna push it through the roof.
- You called Bernie?
- Yeah.
And frankly, when Bernie Goldfinger talks, I listen, Donna.
Well, what if he's wrong?
Don't be stupid.
Bernie's an expert.
We're not selling.
Morning, all.
Oh, you decided to come to school.
To what do we owe the honour?
Good morning.
I'm sorry about last night.
- Dylan, you've been drinking.
- Bren, would I come to school drunk?
You smell like a brewery.
I better get you out of here.
Man, hey, I'm fine.
Besides, I got a trig test.
Oh, I'm sure you'll ace that one.
Oh, shut up, Kelly.
You know, there's one thing worse than a drunk, that's a mean drunk.
I suddenly have the urge to just get the hell out of here.
So why don't you give my regards to trig?
Dylan.
Brandon, you've gotta do something.
Look, it's his problem.
Just don't get sucked in, all right?
I don't care.
Brandon, you can't let him drink.
I'll do what I can.
Brenda, you're making a big mistake.
Dylan is gonna do what he's gonna do.
But I can't stand by and let him do it.
Bren, he's an alcoholic.
I know that, Kelly.
Do you know what that means?
Look, I love him so much.
I can't stand to see him get hurt.
I know, it's hard.
But just trust me, you have to let him hit bottom.
What does that mean, hit bottom?
I mean, that sounds so final.
Brenda, you just have to have some faith.
It wasn't easy watching my mom degrade herself night after night.
When she was drunk, I wanted to kill her.
When she was sick, it tore my heart out.
But I learned that I just had to let her go through it by herself.
Because the more I tried to help, the worse it got.
You know why?
Because I was there.
And as long as I was there, she knew she could keep on drinking and I'd be there to pick up the pieces.
Bren, you can love him, but you can't save him.
Can't let you drive, pal.
I'm fine.
Anywhere you wanna go, I'll take you.
I just don't wanna scrape you off a telephone pole today.
It's this thing I got against it, you know.
Anywhere?
Anywhere.
Your friend's pretty good.
He took a lot of money off me yesterday.
Really, how much?
Five hundred.
Dollars?
Don't worry, kid.
I already won it back.
Your shot, man.
Haven't you had enough of this, man?
- We've been here all day.
- l can't walk out on this game, Bran.
I'm hot, never been this hot.
I'm gonna wipe this guy out.
What are you talking about?
You lost 500 bucks already.
That was his money.
Dylan, you're not making sense.
This guy's playing you for a chump.
How long you gonna keep this up?
Till I'm numb.
Till I forget where l am and why I came here in the first place, all right?
What do I do?
Should I call the police, hospitals?
He's not at the library, he's not at that Peach Pit place.
Look, Iris, I know what you're going through.
I mean, I can never get to sleep until the two of them are safe in their beds and asleep.
But it's only 1 0:30.
I know, but I think he's drinking, Cindy.
Sometimes he doesn't get in till 2, 3 in the morning.
Well, now, if this has been going on for some time, why are you so worried tonight?
Because last night, he didn't come home at all.
You know, Brenda said everybody was going to the movies.
He's probably with them.
Well, then why didn't he call?
I don't know how much longer I can take this.
This isn't working, Cindy.
I don't know how to do this.
But you don't have much choice, do you?
I mean, you're his mother.
Well, that's easier said than done.
- Hi.
- lsn't Brandon with you?
- Where's Dylan?
- l don't know.
- Oh, my God.
- Why, what's wrong?
I am calling the police and the hospitals.
Would somebody first please tell me what's going on?
Has Dylan been drinking?
Yes.
But Brandon made sure he didn't drive.
Well, maybe he should have made sure he didn't drink.
Where do you get off criticizing Brandon?
He has been there for Dylan whenever Dylan needed him, which is a lot more than I can say for you.
Brenda.
Sorry, Mom, it is true.
Why else do you think Dylan's falling apart?
Brandon is with him?
Yes.
Okay. lf he's with Brandon, then he's fine.
Well, that's it, rich kid. I'm done.
Hey, man, you gotta give me a chance to get even here.
No, I don't gotta do anything.
I said I'm done, I'm done.
Pay up.
Funny, I don't see you reaching into your pocket.
That's because I don't have it.
You play pool, you carry cash.
I told you when we started that I don't take any lOUs.
Well, then I guess you don't get paid.
- He'll get it, man.
He's good for it.
- Brandon, stay out of it.
You wanna go for a walk?
is that what you're saying to me?
Come on, man.
Come on, man, he's had enough.
That was just to let you know that I'm serious.
It's the next time that I get mean.
So don't mess with me.
Bring cash tomorrow.
Let's go.
Dylan.
Dylan, you okay, pal?
You all right?
Yeah.
Come on, let's get out of here.
Where have you been?
Brandon, it's a school night.
Do you know what time it is?
- What are you doing here?
- l've been worried sick.
- Oh, please, spare me.
- Brandon.
Sorry.
We lost track of the time.
You lost track of the time?
It's almost 1 :00.
- Where were you?
- Hanging out.
We were at a pool hall.
I got in a game.
It's like Brandon said, we lost track of time.
Oh, my God.
Do you always get a fat lip when you play?
- l lost some money.
- How much?
- Eight hundred dollars.
- l can't handle this.
You never could handle anything, could you?
Don't you speak to me like that.
I do not deserve to be spoken to in that way.
Well, how should I speak to you?
With respect?
Or like someone who walked out on me when I was 6 years old?
I'm sorry.
Would you excuse us for a minute?
I need to talk to my son.
Brenda, come on.
Everybody, into the kitchen.
All right, are you involved in this?
No, Dad. I was just trying to help him cool out a little bit.
- l did the best job I could.
- Oh, Dylan.
I think the time for feeling sorry for Dylan is over.
I know.
How can you say that?
Brenda, the kind of problems that Dylan has take a long time to build up.
Now, we've all been there for him.
But there's only so much that any of us can do.
You're abandoning him.
You said that you would stand by him, that you'd help him.
Brenda, he has a mother now.
Yeah, that's the trouble.
Then he's gonna have to work it out with her.
And, Brenda, until Dylan shows he can get a grip on his life, I don't want you seeing him.
Do you understand?
Dylan, I admit it, I don't know what to do.
I do not know how to handle you.
I'm not your problem.
You're my responsibility.
Really?
Since when?
If you're trying to hurt me you're succeeding.
Tell me why.
Why should I all of a sudden start listening to you?
Because I am your mother and I love you.
Oh, please, let's not bring love into this.
Dylan.
Dylan!
Oh, this is ridiculous.
I don't know how to be a mother.
Iris, it's not something you can figure out in just one month.
I've been working at it full-time for over 1 6 years.
When Jack was arrested, I thought to myself, finally, I get my son back.
I thought I'll just move right on in.
Oh, God, what a fool.
Oh, Iris, don't say that.
He needs you, whether he realizes it or not.
Cindy, that is a beautiful platitude, but let's not kid ourselves.
I walked out on my son.
Why should I expect him ever to forgive me for that?
Or even want to understand why?
He's right.
I don't deserve to be a part of his life.
Dylan, my father says I can't see you until you get your life together.
Yeah, well, he's probably right.
I don't wanna lose you, Dylan.
Not this time.
I'll be all right, Bren.
Promise.
Hey!
Hey, did you see this?
- Did you see this?
- What?
Well, that wonderful company you picked for us to invest our life savings in is having a little problem.
What's wrong?
Well, it says that L.A. Sharp's shoe factory in Korea burned to the ground.
We're gonna lose everything.
Why do I listen to you and your stupid ideas?
Well, maybe you should have listened to me.
- What's that supposed to mean?
- l told you we should have sold.
But no, you had to go and be greedy, Mr. Big Shot.
- So say it, I told you so.
- l told you so.
Great, 20/20 hindsight.
Well, it's not exactly hindsight.
What's that mean?
I sold.
- You what?
- Yeah, yesterday.
Right after you called me a stupid wimp, right?
- You did not.
- l did.
And I made a lot of money and I'm not stupid.
And don't either of you ever call me stupid again.
Thank you.
I think we ought to get her to pick us another stock.
What do you say, Kel?
I'm in.
What time is it?
Noon.
Made you breakfast.
Real food.
Thanks.
Dylan, the things you said last night-- l'm sorry. I was just a little out of it.
But you were right.
I thought I could come here, that...
That I could make up for all those lost years.
I can't.
So where does that leave us?
Dylan, I'm here for you.
But you don't need a full-time mom any more than I know how to be one.
You've been on your own for a while.
And from what Cindy Walsh tells me, you take pretty good care of yourself.
Well, that's when you don't have a mother around to throw a wrench in the works.
Maybe I didn't give you a chance.
No.
But the best thing that I can do for you is to give you your freedom.
I'm gonna go back to Hawaii.
What?
I know that some people may say that I'm copping out.
That things got a little rough and I split.
But the truth is, Dylan, I wasn't there for you 1 1 years ago when you really needed me.
So I'm not gonna pretend to be here for you now when you don't.
When we split up, your father offered me a lot of money to keep out of your life.
If I'd been stronger, I might have fought him harder and longer and I might have won.
But we'll never know, because I gave up.
I took his money and I disappeared.
But I promised myself that I would never, ever touch a penny of it.
And I didn't.
So...
This belongs to you.
That's a lot of money.
Yeah.
It's yours.
I don't want it.
I've asked Jim Walsh to set up a trust.
That way, you won't blow it all at once.
Make a good life for yourself, baby.
What about you?
Oh, don't worry about me.
I've got a tree house on a pineapple mountain, remember?
What I do want is for us to start again.
To build a relationship based on something real.
That way, maybe sometime, you won't wanna call me Iris.
You'll wanna call me Mom.
Dylan's in the car.
We're on our way to the airport.
I just wanted to say goodbye.
And thanks.
To all of you.
Good luck, Iris.
You take care of my son.
We will.
Iris.
I'm sorry for what I said to you.
I understand.
I know it must take a lot of courage to do what you're doing.
He's not an easy guy to love, is he?
No.
But we sure do, don't we?
Yes.
We sure do.
How you doing, pal?
Okay, I guess.
I can't believe she's leaving.
I couldn't put up with her, but I don't really wanna be alone again either.
Yeah, well, you're not alone.
I'm what they call an emancipated minor.
Listen, when you get back from the airport, give me a call.
There's someplace we gotta go.
Yeah, I know.
Falcone.
After that.
Where?
Someplace you took me when I needed a friend.
God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, the courage to change the things I can, and the wisdom to know the difference.
Which came first... the chicken or the egg?
Did the universe have a beginning... and if so, what happened before then?
Where did the universe come from... and where is it going?
Luck.
Luck.
Well... we have been very lucky...
I mean, my family and Stephen and everybody.
You have your disasters, but the point is that we have survived.
Everybody has disasters, and yet some people disappear... and are never seen again.
Flying bombs are very alarming.
They came buzzing over... and then they would cut out.
And when you heard the bang, you knew it wasn't you... so you went back to your meal or whatever.
But one did fall quite close to our house... and it blew the back windows out... so that the glass was sticking dagger points all out of the opposite wall.
When Stephen was born, we decided... he'd better be born in Oxford.
So while I was staying in the hospital...
I went to Blackwell's in Oxford... and I bought an astronomical atlas.
One of my sisters-in-law said...
"This is a very prophetic thing for you to have done."
How real is time?
Will it ever come to an end?
Where does the difference... between the past and the future come from?
Why do we remember the past... but not the future?
I can remember the day... when we traveled through London and the blackout was over.
And the trains, instead of being shut in... by blinds so that you just traveled in a train... we were coming over one of the bridges... and all the lights...
well, such lights as were left... were on in London, but it was also a completely starry night... and you could see the light.
It was beautiful.
I remember we all used to lie on the grass, looking straight up through a telescope... and seeing the wonders of the stars.
Stephen always had a strong sense of wonder... and I could see that the stars would draw him... and further than the stars.
I was born exactly 300 years... after the death of Galileo.
I estimate that about 200,000 other babies... were also born that day.
I don't know whether any of them... was later interested in astronomy.
My first memory is of Isobel... pushing a rather antiquated... carriage-built pram along North Road... with Stephen and Mary in it... sort of looking very large... because they had large heads and pink cheeks, and they were very noticeable.
They all looked different from ordinary people.
I can remember visiting the Hawking home... oh, several times.
It was the sort of place where, if invited to stay to supper... you might, uh... be allowed to have your conversation with Stephen... but the rest of the family would be sitting... at the table reading a book... a behavior which was not really approved of in my circle... but which was tolerated from the Hawkings... because they were recognized to be... very eccentric, highly intelligent... very clever people... but still a bit odd.
My impression of the Hawking family was that they were all like that... except for Stephen, who seemed to be... the only normal member of the family.
Stephen used to reckon he knew, I think it was... 11 ways of getting into the house, and I could only find ten.
I'm not sure where the other way was.
On the north side of the house was a bicycle shed.
It had a door at the front and a door at the back.
Above that, there was a window into the L-shaped room... and at the front you could get sort of around the corner... onto the roof... and from that level... you could get onto the main roof.
I think one of the ways...
Stephen could get in was on the main roof.
As I say, he was a much better climber than I was.
I still didn't know what the 11th one was.
Before the 20th century... it was thought that the universe had existed forever... or had been created at some time in the past... more or less as we observe it today.
People found comfort in the thought... that even though they may grow old and die... the universe was eternal and unchanging.
I gave up playing games with Stephen... oh, when he was ill that time when he was about 12... because he started taking games terribly seriously.
We had Monopoly... and first of all... the Monopoly board sprang railways going across it... to add to the complications... and then Monopoly just wasn't adaptable enough.
He ended up with a fearful game called Dynasty... which, as far as I can make out...
I never played it... went on forever because there was no way of ending it.
It was almost a substitute for living, as far as I could make out.
It took hours and hours and hours.
I thought it was a perfectly terrible game.
I couldn't imagine anyone getting taken up with that.
But Stephen always had a very complicated mind... and I felt as much as anything... it was the complication of it that appealed to him.
When I was in high school, I learned that light... from distant galaxies was shifted to the red.
This meant that they were moving away from us... and that the universe was expanding.
But I didn't believe it.
A static universe seemed much more natural.
It could have existed... and could continue to exist forever.
We were discussing the possibility... of the spontaneous generation of life... and I think that Stephen made a remark... which indicated not only that he'd thought of this... but he'd even also... come across some calculations... as to how long it might take.
At that time, I think I made a comment... to one of my friends, John McClenahan...
"I think that Stephen... will turn out to be unusually capable."
I don't think I put it in quite those words... but I made some such remark to him... and he disagreed.
And so we made a bet on the subject.
In our childish way, we bet... a bag of sweets on the issue.
And incidentally, I reckon that my bet has come correct... and I think I'm entitled to payment... which has not yet been made.
The expansion of the universe... suggested the possibility... that the universe had a beginning... at some time in the past.
The point at which the universe may have started out... became known as the Big Bang.
The first year he was at St. Albans School... he came, I think, third from the bottom.
I said, "Well, Stephen... do you really have to be as far down as that?"
And he said, "Well... a lot of other people didn't do much better."
He was quite unconcerned.
Somehow he was always recognized... as being very bright... and in fact they gave him the Divinity Prize one year.
That was not surprising because his father used to read him...
Bible stories from a very early age... and he knew them all very well... and he was quite well-versed in religious things... although I don't think he makes a great deal of practice of it now.
Everybody used to argue theology.
That's a good, safe subject.
You don't need any facts or... distracting things like that.
If you go in for arguing... you know, debating... you can quite happily debate about anything... including theology... and the existence or otherwise of God.
And then someone gets bored... or Journey Into Space comes on, or something like that... and the argument breaks up.
In an unchanging universe... one can imagine that God created the universe... at literally any time in the past.
On the other hand... if the universe is expanding... there may be physical reasons... why there had to be a beginning.
An expanding universe does not preclude a creator... but it does place limits... on when he might have carried out his job.
When the family went to India... it was arranged that Stephen should come and live with us for a year.
He decided it would be nice... that we should have...
Scottish dancing in the evening.
Mind you, this was quite an ordinary house... but we had rather a lot of room and a large hall... and so we bought some records... and a book about what to do... and Stephen took charge.
And he insisted you put on a jacket and a tie.
And then he was the master of the proceedings.
And Stephen took it very seriously.
But then he liked dancing, you see?
There were four physicists in my year...
Gordon Berry...
Richard Bryan...
Stephen... myself.
I first remember Stephen... on an occasion when Gordon and I went up after dinner to his room... to try to find him.
And Stephen was up there... with a crate of beer... slowly drinking his way through it.
He was only 17.
He couldn't legally go into a pub.
He'd gone up to Oxford ridiculously early.
We used to have what we called a gathering net.
We used to organize a beer party and various things like that... to gather all these... collar as many freshman as we could get... to get them to join the Boat Club.
And that's how we collected him, you see?
But the question always with Stephen was...
"Should we make him the cox of the first eight... or the second eight?"
Well, coxes can be adventurous... and some coxes can be very steady people.
He was rather an adventurous type.
You never knew quite what he was going to do... when he went out with the crew.
I think he used to bring his work with him into the boat sometimes.
His sort of thinking gear was going... on different levels.
We were asked to read chapter 10... in a book called Electricity and Magnetism... by Bleaney and Bleaney, an unlikely combination... a husband-and-wife team... and at the end of that chapter, there were 13 questions... all of them final honors questions.
I discovered very rapidly that I couldn't do any of them.
Richard and I worked together for the week... and we managed to do 1 1/2 questions... which we felt very proud of.
Gordon refused all assistance... and managed to do one all by himself.
Stephen, as always, hadn't even started... but the next morning, he went up to his rooms at 9:00... and we came back about 12:00, maybe five past 12:00... and down came Stephen, and we were in the college gateway, the lodge.
"Ah, Hawking," I said, "how many have you managed to do, then?"
"Well," he said, "I've only had time to do the first ten."
I think at that point we realized that it's not just we weren't in the same street.
We weren't on the same planet.
I once calculated... that I did about 1,000 hours' work... in the three years I was at Oxford... an average of an hour a day.
I am not proud of this lack of work.
I am just describing my attitude at the time... an attitude that nothing was worth making an effort for.
He used to produce his work every week for tutorial... and, as he never kept any notes... or papers or that sort of thing... on leaving my room, he would normally throw it in my wastepaper basket.
And when he was with other undergraduates at the tutorial... and they saw this happen, they were absolutely horrified... 'cause they thought, he did this work in probably half an hour...
If they could have done it in a year, they wouldn't have thrown it in the wastepaper basket.
They would've put it in a frame on their walls.
Because of my lack of work...
I had planned to get through the final exam... by doing problems in theoretical physics... and avoiding any questions that required factual knowledge.
I didn't do very well.
I was on the borderline between a first- and second-class degree... and I had to be interviewed to determine which I should get.
They asked me about my future plans.
I replied, if they gave me a first...
I would go to Cambridge.
If I only got a second...
I would stay in Oxford.
They gave me a first.
I drove Stephen and his young brother... out to Woburn Park... and he climbed a tree.
He was testing himself out, I think.
I didn't realize.
He did manage to climb a tree... and go along a branch of it and get himself down.
I think he began to notice that his hands... were less useful than they had been... but he didn't tell us.
Univ has these square staircases... which are round but they're square.
It was just coming down from one of the rooms.
Steve actually fell on the stairs coming downstairs... and kind of bounced all the way down to the bottom.
I don't know if he lost consciousness, but he lost his memory.
We took him to either my room or someone's room.
The first question of course was, "Who am I?"
We told him, "You're Steve Hawking."
Right away he would ask again, "Who am I?"
"Steve Hawking."
Then, after a couple of minutes, he remembered he was Steve Hawking.
Then we'd say, "Do you remember going down to the bar... and having a drink on Sunday night?"
Or, "Do you remember coxing on the river on Monday?"
And his memory came back gradually... until he could remember the previous day's events, and then the previous hour... and by the end of the two hours, he could remember everything.
The question was, "Well, maybe you've lost... some of your mind because of this."
And so Steve decided, "Well, I'll take the Mensa test."
We said, "Of course you'll get in."
But he came back delighted he was able to get into Mensa.
Absolutely delighted.
I felt that there were two areas... of theoretical physics...
I might study at Cambridge.
One was cosmology, the study of the very large.
The other was elementary particles... the study of the very small.
However, I thought elementary particles... were less attractive... because there was no proper theory.
All they could do... was arrange the particles in families... like in botany.
In cosmology, on the other hand... there was a well-defined theory...
Einstein's general theory of relativity.
It was a very cold year... and the ice on Verulamium Pond... it was frozen there... and we all went skating.
And Stephen managed to skate fairly well... but then, he and I were close together.
He wasn't skating in a very advanced way... but nor was I, if it comes to that.
He fell... and he couldn't get up.
So I took him to a café to warm up... and he told me then all about it.
And it was diagnosed.
I insisted on going to see his doctor... because it seemed to me however long you're going to live... there's probably something someone can do about it... at least anyhow to make things easier for people.
I won't mention the doctor's name... but I got to see him at the London Clinic.
He was rather surprised that I should bother to come 'round to see him.
After all, I was only Stephen's mother.
He was quite nice.
He agreed to see me in a rather grand way.
And he said, "Yes, it's all very sad.
Brilliant young man cut off in the prime of his youth."
But of course I said, "What can we do?
What can we do to sort of...
Can we get physiotherapy?
Can we get anything like that that will help in any way?"
He said, "Well, actually, no.
There's nothing I can do, really.
More or less, that's it."
Shortly after my 21st birthday...
I went into hospital for tests.
They took a muscle sample from my arm... stuck electrodes into me... and injected some radiopaque fluid into my spine... and watched it going up and down with X-rays... as they tilted the bed.
I was diagnosed as having ALS... amyotrophic lateral sclerosis... or motor neuron disease, as it is also known.
The doctors could offer no cure... and gave me 2 1/2 years to live.
I went into the graduates' common room... looking, really, for someone to have lunch with.
There was nobody around that I particularly wished to have lunch with... and then Stephen walked through the door.
I don't know what he was doing at Oxford.
I've certainly forgotten now.
And so Stephen generously went off... to buy the drinks... and brought them and put them on the table.
And as he put his pint of beer down... he spilled it.
I sort of said genially...
"Oh, heavens.
Drinking at this time of day!"
He then told me he'd been in Addenbrooke's for three weeks... and they'd done a whole series of tests... and they'd decided... what was wrong with him.
And he told me very straight and flat... that he was gradually going to lose... the use of his body... that eventually... only his heart and his lungs... would still be operating, and his brain... and that they'd told him that... eventually he would essentially have the body of a cabbage... but his mind would still be in perfect working order... and he would be unable to communicate with the rest of the world.
My dreams at that time were rather disturbed.
Before my condition had been diagnosed...
I had been very bored with life.
There had not seemed to be anything worth doing.
But shortly after I came out of hospital...
I dreamt that I was going to be executed.
I suddenly realized there were a lot of worthwhile things...
I could do if I were reprieved.
I knew perfectly well that he had no faith... and... to me, that made it the more difficult... because you must ask yourself, "Why me?
Why this?
Why now?"
But he just totally, flatly accepted... that this was what was going to happen to him.
As far as I can gather, at that point he started to do some work.
At first, there did not seem much point... in working at my research... because I didn't expect to live long enough... to finish my PhD.
However, as time went by... the disease seemed to slow down.
I began to understand general relativity... and made progress with my work.
But what really made a difference was...
I had got engaged to a girl called Jane Wilde.
This gave me something to live for... but it also meant I had to get a job... if we were to get married.
Stephen was already ill.
Jane knew it.
And it was another instance of Stephen's luck, you know... meeting the right person at the right time... because Stephen was very, very badly depressed... and he wasn't very much inclined to go on with his work.
He'd been told he's only got 2 1/2 years.
What can you do in that time?
But meeting Jane really put him on his mettle... and he started to work.
I wanted to understand... how the universe began.
Einstein's theory of general relativity... showed that the universe was expanding.
But there was no answer to the crucial question...
"Must there have been a Big Bang... a beginning to time?"
Then, in my third year at Cambridge...
Roger Penrose made his discovery... about the death of stars.
I remember talking to this friend, Ivor Robinson... and we were having this animated conversation... and then we had to cross a road... and as we crossed the road, of course, the conversation stopped... and then we got to the other side.
Evidently, I had some idea crossing the road... but then the conversation started up, and it got completely blotted out of my mind.
It was only later, after my friend had gone home... and I began to have this strange feeling of elation... feeling wonderful.
I couldn't figure out why I should feel like that, so I went back over the day... thinking all possible things which might have contributed to such a feeling... and then gradually I unearthed this thought... which I'd had while crossing the street.
Penrose announced this result... that when stars collapse indefinitely... they will become singular... as long as some very broad conditions are satisfied... that everybody would have regarded as reasonable.
And I remember Stephen Hawking, who was then approaching... his third year as a research student, saying...
"What very interesting results.
I wonder whether they could be adapted... to understanding the origin of the universe."
And what he had in mind, you see, was that if, just mentally... you reverse the sense of time... you can think of the expanding universe as a collapsing system.
It's a bit like a very giant star collapsing.
Roger Penrose proved... that a dying star, collapsing under its own gravity... eventually shrinks to a singularity... a point of infinite density and zero size.
I realized that if I reversed the direction of time... so that the collapse became an expansion...
I could prove that... the universe had a beginning.
But my proof... based on Einstein's theory of general relativity... also showed that we cannot understand... how the universe began... because it showed that all scientific theories... including general relativity itself... break down at the beginning of the universe.
We had this meeting... at the Institute of Space Physics in New York.
I said, "Before we reach a final conclusion... we ought to throw into the pot... still another object... a gravitationally completely collapsed object.
Well, after you've used the phrase...
"a gravitationally completely collapsed object" ten times... you conclude you've got to get a better name.
So that's when I switched... to the word "black hole".
The word "black hole," which John Wheeler coined, suddenly caught on.
Everybody adopted it, and from then on... people around the world...
in Moscow... in America... in England and elsewhere... could know they were speaking about the same thing.
And not only that, but suddenly... the whole range of concepts got through to the general public... and even science-fiction writers all of a sudden... could talk about it.
Tonight, my friends... we stand on the brink of a feat unparalleled... in space exploration.
If the data on my returning probe ship... matches my computerized calculations...
I will travel where no man has dared to go.
Into the black hole?
In... through... and beyond.
Why, that's crazy!
Ha!
Impossible!
As a massive star contracts... its gravity becomes so strong... that light can no longer escape.
The region from which nothing can escape... is called a black hole... and its boundary is called the event horizon.
One might say of the event horizon... what Dante said of the entrance to hell...
"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here."
I was once asked to actually... be an adjudicator... on an essay of which the subject was...
"How to fall through a black hole and live."
Now, the problem I had was that I wouldn't know... how to give out the prize... because if I said, "That looks like a good essay"... the only real way of showing this was right... was to actually follow it, to do the experiment and fall in.
But then, having fallen in...
I would assume taking the person who wrote the essay with you... the question would be, how do you tell the rest of the world?
Do you take the prize in that you give to them... and what do they do with it when they get to the center?
Believe me...
I've been waiting a long time for someone like you... to record this moment.
Thank you, Doctor.
Then I'm ready.
Ready to embark on man's greatest journey.
Certainly his riskiest.
The risk is incidental compared to... the possibility to possess the great truth of the unknown.
There... long-cherished laws of nature... simply do not apply.
They vanish.
And life?
Life?
Life forever.
If you were watching an astronaut... foolhardy enough to jump into a black hole... at some time on his watch... say, 12:00... he would cross the event horizon... and enter the black hole.
But no matter how long you waited... you would never see the astronaut's watch reach 12:00.
Instead, each second on the watch... would appear to take longer and longer... until the last second before midnight... would take forever.
Thus, by jumping into a black hole... one could ensure that one's image lasted forever.
But the picture would fade very rapidly... and grow so dim that no one could see it.
As somebody disappears into a black hole... as seen from the outside, it looks as though... time actually slows down, and the person who's moving... at least he's thinking he's moving... he's perhaps talking in his spaceship at a normal rate... seems to slow down and ends up being frozen... in a particular position... as seen by somebody watching him from the outside.
And as seen from the outside, you never see what happens after that.
The astronaut wouldn't notice anything special... when his watch reached midnight... and he crossed the event horizon... into the black hole... until, of course, he approached the singularity... and was crushed into spaghetti.
One can fall through this event horizon... without feeling anything, without noticing it.
After about a week of falling, one begins to feel the pinch... and one extends longer and longer... and gets slightly thinner.
And, of course, one begins to get squeezed... until one gets very long and very thin... and rather nasty.
By the end of two weeks, one's fallen right into the center and is, of course, dead.
Before you lose sight of the outer world... you would see things happening and see them at a greater rate... so that it would look like a firework display.
The frustration would be that, although you would be able to see... everything that happens in the future, it would be going so fast... that from a scientific point of view, you'd have no time to analyze it.
You wouldn't be able to take it in.
Eventually things would be going off so fast... and it would be so explosive that you yourself would be... destroyed by the explosion, and that would be the end.
But it would be a very exciting way to end one's life.
It would be the way I would choose if I had the choice.
In the long history of the universe... many stars must have burned up their nuclear fuel... and collapsed in on themselves.
The number of black holes may be greater... than the number of visible stars... which totals about a hundred thousand million... in our galaxy alone.
We also have evidence... that there is a very large black hole... at the center of our own galaxy.
Friends ask me, "Well, if a black hole is black... how can you see it?"
And I say, "Have you ever been to a ball?
Have you ever watched the young men... dressed in their black evening tuxedos... and the girls in their white dresses... whirling around, held in each other's arms... and the lights turned low... and all you can see is the girls?
Well, the girl is the ordinary star... and the boy is the black hole.
You can't see the black hole any more than you can see the boy... but the girl going around gives you convincing evidence... there must be something there holding her in orbit."
One evening, shortly after the birth of my daughter, Lucy...
I started to think about black holes... as I was getting into bed.
My disability makes this rather a slow process... so I had plenty of time.
Suddenly I realized... that the area of the event horizon... must always increase with time.
The increase in the area of the event horizon... was very reminiscent of a quantity called entropy... which measures the degree of disorder of a system.
It is a matter of common experience... that disorder tends to increase with time... if things are left to themselves.
Jacob Bekenstein came into the office one day.
"Jacob," I said...
"It always troubles me... when I put a hot teacup next to a cold teacup.
I've increased, by letting heat flow from one to the other... the amount of disorder in the universe.
But Jacob, if a black hole swims by... and I drop both teacups into this...
I've concealed the evidence of my crime, have I not?"
Bekenstein's a man of great integrity... and he looked troubled, and he came back to me later... and he said, "No, you have not... concealed the evidence of your crime.
The black hole records what's happened to you."
Stephen Hawking read the paper... in which Bekenstein announced this result... thought it was preposterous... and decided to prove it was wrong.
My discoveries led Jacob Bekenstein to suggest... that the area of the event horizon... actually was the entropy of a black hole.
But there was one fatal flaw... in Bekenstein's idea:
If black holes have an entropy... they ought to have a temperature.
And if they have a temperature... they ought to give off radiation.
But how could they give off radiation... if nothing can escape from a black hole?
As it turned out...
Bekenstein was basically correct... though in a manner far more surprising... than he or anyone else had expected.
As he gradually lost the use of his hands... he had to start developing... carefully choosing research projects... that could be tackled and solved... through geometrical arguments that he could do pictorially in his head.
And he developed a very powerful set of tools nobody else really had.
So in some sense, when you lose one set of tools... you may develop other tools, but the new tools... are amenable to different kinds of problems than the old tools.
And if you're the only master in the world of these new tools... that means certain kinds of problems you can solve and nobody else can.
My work up to 1973... was in general relativity... and was summarized in a book I wrote with George Ellis called...
The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time.
Even then, it was difficult for me to write things down... so I tended to think in pictures and diagrams... that I could visualize in my head.
I remember visiting Stephen and Jane... at their home in Cambridge.
After supper in the evening... when it was time for Stephen to go to bed...
Jane insisted and Stephen acquiesced...
I guess this was standard... that Stephen make his way up...
I've forgotten whether it was one flight of stairs or two... alone... and this was a period when he could no longer walk.
The way he got up the stairs was, he grabbed hold of the pillars... that support the banister and pulled him up with the strength... pulled himself up the stairs with the strength of his own arms... dragging himself up... from the ground floor up to the second story... in a long, arduous effort.
Jane explained that... this was an important part of his physical therapy... to maintain his coordination... and strength as long as possible.
At first it was sort of heartrending... to watch what appeared to be the agony of pulling himself up the stairs... until I understood it's just part of life... pulling himself up the stairs like that.
General relativity is what is called... a classical theory.
It predicts a single definite path... for each particle.
But according to quantum mechanics... there is an element of chance or uncertainty.
A particle does not have... just a single path through space and time.
Instead, there is an uncertainty principle... according to which both the exact position... and velocity of a particle can never be known.
I began investigating... the effect quantum mechanics might have... on particles near a black hole.
I found that particles could escape... from a black hole... that black holes are not completely black.
At first I didn't believe it.
But when I redid the calculations...
I couldn't get the effect to go away.
I met Martin Rees, and he was shaking with excitement... and he said, "Have you heard?
Have you heard... what Stephen has discovered?
Everything is different!
Everything is changed!"
I was still unsure of my discovery... so I only told a few colleagues... but word soon spread.
Roger Penrose phoned up on my birthday.
He was very excited and went on so long... that my birthday dinner got quite cold.
It was a great pity, because it was goose... which I'm very fond of.
To me it's a miracle, 'cause it's a complicated and messy calculation.
We can now do these things very much better... and it's more transparent what happens.
But out of this messy calculation, he showed that black holes... aren't black with this quantum mechanical effect.
There was a residual radiation.
Stephen came to a meeting... and people were flabbergasted.
I remember someone saying, "You must be wrong, Stephen.
I don't believe a word of it."
I once said that I was unhappy... with the explanation given in terms of negative energy particles being created.
But I feel this is part of the controversy of science.
You must have the give and take, and I'm delighted to be a part of that.
That's what makes it fun.
If you all sat down and said, "Oh, lovely"... when you do have niggling questions in your mind... that's not doing a service to science.
But I was not antagonistic to it in any way... except for that one time when I questioned.
I finally convinced myself... that black holes radiate... when I found a mechanism through which this could happen.
According to quantum mechanics... space is filled with virtual particles... and antiparticles... that are constantly materializing in pairs... separating, coming together again... and annihilating each other.
In the presence of a black hole... one member of a pair of virtual particles... may fall into the hole... leaving the other member without a partner... with which to annihilate.
The forsaken particle appears to be radiation... emitted by the black hole.
And so black holes are not eternal.
They evaporate away at an increasing rate... until they vanish in a gigantic explosion.
Quantum mechanics has allowed particles and radiation... to escape from the ultimate prison... a black hole.
Einstein never accepted quantum mechanics... because of its element of chance and uncertainty.
He said, "God does not play dice."
It seems that Einstein was doubly wrong.
The quantum effects of black holes... suggest that not only does God play dice... he sometimes throws them... where they cannot be seen.
He says himself... that, uh... he wouldn't have got to where he is if he hadn't been ill.
And I think that's quite possible... because it's like Johnson said:
The knowledge you're to be hanged in the morning... concentrates the mind wonderfully.
And he has concentrated on this in a way...
I don't think he would have, because he took a great interest... in a lot of things in life... and I don't know that he'd have applied himself the same way... if he'd been able to get around as he used to do, so in a way...
No, I can't think anyone's lucky having an illness like that, even so.
But it's less bad luck for him than it would be for some people... because he can so much live in his head.
When I lived with the Hawking family, I would usually get up... around 7:15 or 7:30 and take a shower... and then read in my Bible some in the morning and pray... and then go down at 8:15 to get Stephen up.
And at breakfast I would often tell him what I'd been reading in the Bible... hoping that this would eventually have some influence.
So then we would go into work... and usually we'd go in and see if there were any scientific papers... that people sent out.
I did discover that despite Hawking's great brilliance, he does read quite slowly.
I could read about twice as fast as he.
But of course he would have to read to remember it... because it would be very difficult for him to go back and access the thing... whereas I could skim the paper rather quickly and see...
"Is there something interesting in this?"
If I wanted to work on it, I could pick the thing up and look at it.
Black hole radiation... has shown us that gravitational collapse... is not as final as we once thought.
If an astronaut falls into a black hole... he will be returned to the rest of the universe... in the form of radiation.
Thus, in a sense... the astronaut will be recycled.
However, it would be a poor sort of immortality... because any personal concept of time... would come to an end as he is torn apart... inside the black hole.
All that would survive... would be his mass, or energy.
One year, the Hawkings took me along... when we went to a cottage in Wales... near the River Wye... and this cottage was up a hill... and there was a bit of... a paved little sidewalk that went up to the cottage... which I had not been up, and of course...
I wanted to do it in the least number of trips I could imagine... so we put Stephen's batteries under his chair... his wheelchair has space for batteries...
and put extra batteries under there... which Stephen didn't realize that I'd put under there... so he didn't realize his wheelchair was as heavily laden.
Stephen got quite a bit ahead of me, and he was turning the corner... to go around to his house, but that was on a slope... so I looked up, and I noticed Stephen's wheelchair slowly tipping backward.
Of course, I was about ten meters away... and tried to run up there, but I was not able to get there... rapidly enough before he toppled backward into the bushes.
So it was a bit of a shocking sight... to see this master of gravity getting overcome... by the weak gravitational force of Earth.
One of the worst things for me would be having people there all the time.
Never alone.
I couldn't bear that.
And yet he finds things funny... and he enjoys life and he goes dashing about all over the place... and I think this is tremendous.
But it's a sort of courage I haven't got... and his father hadn't got it, and we cannot but admire it... but wonder how on earth he got it, really.
There must have been 50 people there... and I was standing off in a corner... sort of watching quietly... for a few minutes, relaxing... and Stephen was over there, not far from me.
Jane walked over to Stephen and looked at him.
He was sitting there with his head in his lap... like only Stephen can put his head in his lap.
And Jane said to Stephen...
"You look miserable, Stephen.
Sit up straight.
Some of your guests don't understand... that you're thinking about physics and having a wonderful time.
It looks like you're in pain.
Sit up and go talk to your guests."
In 1979...
I was elected Lucasian Professor of Mathematics.
This is the same chair once held by Isaac Newton.
They have a big book which every university teaching officer... is supposed to sign.
After I had been Lucasian Professor for about a year... they realized I had never signed.
So they brought the book to my office... and I signed with some difficulty.
That was the last time I signed my name.
My interest in the origin and fate of the universe... was reawakened when I attended... a conference on cosmology in the Vatican.
Afterwards, we were granted... an audience with the pope.
He told us that it was all right... to study the evolution of the universe... after the Big Bang... but we should not inquire into the Big Bang itself... because that was the moment of creation... and therefore the work of God.
I was glad that he did not know... the subject of the talk I had just given... the possibility that the universe had no beginning... no moment of creation.
There were theories in the early '70s...
the first type of creation theories... where the people concerned started off with a fixed, external space and time... which for eternity was empty... and then suddenly, for some unknown reason, the universe nucleates... at a particular point and then, bang, it blows apart.
But the trouble is that when space and time appear in the classical theory... that actual point itself is a singular point in the mathematics.
Mathematics breaks down, and so... you cannot use that to give you a creation theory.
If one goes back in time... one comes to the Big Bang singularity... where the laws of physics break down.
But there's another direction of time... that one can go in which avoids the singularity.
This is called the imaginary direction of time.
In imaginary time... there need not be any singularities... which form a beginning or end to time.
When you come to imaginary time, you have this rather peculiar possibility... of having a "now," as it were... without necessarily having a sort of a chain... of past moments.
If we start where we are at the moment and start running backwards in time... then for a long time, things work perfectly normally.
But as you begin to get further and further back towards... what would be the origin point in the conventional real-time picture... you'd find that the nature of time changes... that the imaginary component becomes more and more prominent... until what ought to have been the singular point in the classical theory... gets smoothed away, and you have this beautiful picture... of these bowls where the creation of the universe is pictures... of where we are now, and a smooth bowl of the past... where there's no initial point, just a sort of smooth shape.
So long as the universe had a beginning... we could suppose it had a creator.
But if the universe is completely self-contained... having no boundary or edge... it would neither be created nor destroyed.
It would simply be.
What place, then, for a creator?
All you can really say is that the universe is... because it's a self-consistent mathematical structure.
There's no past because, unlike the creation-as-a-point scenario... there's nothing for it to be created in.
So to say it's created from nothing is a bit of a misnomer.
It's a misleading use of the word "nothing".
It's not just that there was empty space in which the universe appeared, which you might call "nothing".
There was really nothing at all, because there wasn't even a creation event.
The use of a past tense in a verb becomes inappropriate in these theories.
Unfortunately, tenses were set up when people believed in real time, of course... and we don't yet have a linguistic form to describe tenses in imaginary time.
The word "time" was not handed down from heaven... as a gift from on high.
The idea of time is a word... invented by man... and if it has puzzlements connected with it... whose fault is it?
It's our fault.
Where does the difference... between the past and the future come from?
The laws of science do not distinguish... between the past and the future.
Yet there is a big difference... between the past and future in ordinary life.
You may see a cup of tea fall off a table... and break into pieces on the floor... but you will never see the cup gather itself back together... and jump back on the table.
The increase of disorder, or entropy... is what distinguishes the past from the future... giving a direction to time.
He fell ill in Switzerland.
When he came back, he was on a ventilator.
Because he's on a ventilator, you've got a tube down your throat... and therefore you can't speak, just for that reason.
For that period, which may have been a couple of months...
I spent probably one in two nights, one in three nights, at the hospital... because when he was in hospital... he couldn't communicate with the nurses.
It's not just like being seriously ill... but you're in a position where the nurses couldn't understand what Stephen wanted.
If Stephen was uncomfortable, they couldn't tell why.
Before I caught pneumonia... my speech had been getting more slurred... so that only a few people who knew me well... could understand me.
But at least I could communicate.
I wrote scientific papers... by dictating to a secretary... and I gave seminars through an interpreter.
And then, a tracheostomy operation... removed my ability to speak altogether.
After a long time...
well, it seemed like a long time... somebody came up with this brilliant gadget.
They didn't have it at the Cambridge hospital.
They got it from somewhere in London.
This was high technology... how you can communicate with a person with no voice.
It's a plastic piece of Perspex about so big... and you've got the letters of the alphabet arranged like that, and a hole in the middle.
You hold it up between you and the other person.
They look at a letter, and you can see which letter they're looking at... most of the time.
Sometimes you can't be sure.
So you would get the patient to spell out what they wanted.
So each letter...
they have to look to pick out the A.
You say, "A?" Did you get it right?
It's like a guessing game.
Stephen wasn't willing to accept that he wasn't going to speak again... and he thought he would be giving in... by trying to find a method of communicating other than speech.
I remember I went in one evening... and this was the first time that he asked... to be gotten out of bed to use the computer.
Sometimes they'd sit him up so he wasn't lying in bed all the time... as you do with a patient, but this time when I turned up... he asked the nurse, could he be gotten out of bed... so he could use the computer, and he did.
I remember the first thing he typed on there after saying hello...
Stephen's always very polite about things like that... was, "Will you help me finish my book?"
A computer expert in California... heard of my plight... and sent me a computer program... called Equalizer.
This allowed me to select words... from a series of menus on a screen... by pressing a switch in my hand.
These words could then be sent to a speech synthesizer... attached to my wheelchair.
Much to my surprise...
I found I was able to communicate... much better than before.
When eventually he went home from hospital... he was told he needed 24-hour nursing, and everyone was saying...
"How is he going to go in and do work?
Is he going to trail around with nurses after him in the office?"
And of course he did.
They talked originally of him working at home... which he wasn't happy with.
And so, after a period of recuperation at home... he just decided to go back into the office.
And he'd make the trip from his house to the office... which is, I don't know, half a mile in his wheelchair... with a nurse walking along with him.
This is at the time when he was still driving around... with the bag and the nasal drip... going into the department, working, going back home.
I began to wonder what would happen... when the universe stopped expanding... and began to contract.
Would we see broken cups... gather themselves together off the floor... and jump back onto the table?
Would we be able to remember tomorrow's prices... and make a fortune off the stock market?
It seemed to me... the universe had to return to a smooth and ordered state... when it recollapsed.
If this were so, time would go backwards... when the universe began to collapse.
People in the contracting phase would live their lives backward.
They would die before they were born... and get younger as the universe got small again.
Eventually, they would return to the womb.
He gave me my first problem to do.
He asked me to look at this mathematical problem.
Usually when he gives a problem, he has a good idea... of what the answer should be.
I went to look at it, and it took me a few months... to understand what it was about, and I came back and said, "I get this answer."
And he said to me, "No, that is not what I expected."
I said, "That's what I get." So I went to the blackboard, explained what it was.
He said, "Did you think about that particular case?" I said, "No, I didn't."
So I went back... and I calculated what he'd talked to me about.
I came back a few weeks after, and I said, "Stephen, I don't get this thing.
I still get the same answer I had originally."
So he said to me, "No, no, no, no.
This doesn't work.
Did you think about that?"
I said, "Oh, no.
I'd forgotten about that particular case."
So I went back to the drawing board and started calculating again... and again I got the same answer.
So I went back to see Stephen, and this dragged on for two or three months.
Finally he said to me...
"Maybe one of your approximations is not valid."
So me and a colleague decided to do the thing with computers.
This takes a lot of time to write the programs... and to be sure the program was correct.
We get the answer, and it was still the way I'd said before... and not the way Stephen said, so we went to see Stephen and said, "See?
Again."
I had made a mistake.
I had been using too simple a model of the universe.
Time will not reverse direction... when the universe begins to contract.
People will continue to get older... so it is no good waiting until the universe recollapses... to return to our youth.
Einstein once asked the question...
"How much choice did God have... in constructing the universe?"
If my proposal that the universe has no boundary is correct... he had no freedom at all... to choose how the universe began.
He would only have had the freedom... to choose the laws the universe obeyed.
This, however, may not have been... all that much of a choice.
There may well be only one unified theory... that allows for the existence of structures... as complicated as human beings... who can investigate the laws of the universe... and ask about the nature of God.
I don't know how clear-cut these experiments are... but there are experiments that have been done on the timing of consciousness... and they seem to lead to a very odd picture... which doesn't even quite make consistent sense.
Whether refinement of these experiments... might get rid of this kind of anomaly I'm not sure... but it does look a little as though there is something very odd about consciousness... and somehow almost as though the future affects the past in some way... over a very tiny, limited scale, but something maybe of the order... of a reasonable fraction of a second.
And there's no reason to believe... that one's conscious experience... shouldn't be part of somebody else's... at some other stage.
I don't know if it's fair to say what happens after one dies... but it's a plausible picture... that you could be somebody else... and that somebody else could be somebody that lived in the past, not in the future.
Even if there is only one possible unified theory... that is just a set of rules and equations... what is it that breathes fire into the equations... and makes a universe for them to describe?
Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing?
Is the unified theory so compelling... that it brings about its own existence?
Or does it need a creator?
And, if so... who created him?
I think I would say that the universe has a purpose.
It's not somehow just there by chance.
I think it's...
Yeah.
So... it's... it's...
Some people, I think, take the view that the universe is just there... and it sort of runs and runs, and it just sort of computes... and we happen somehow by accident to find ourselves in this thing.
But I don't think that's a very fruitful... or helpful way of looking at the universe.
I think that there is something much deeper about it.
In real time, the time in which we live... the universe has two possible destinies:
It may continue to expand forever... or it may recollapse and come to an end... at the Big Crunch.
It would be rather like the Big Bang... but in reverse.
I now believe that the universe will come to an end... at the Big Crunch.
I do, however, have certain advantages... over many other prophets of doom.
Whatever happens ten billion years from now...
I don't expect to be around to be proved wrong.
Of all the pictures that I know... the simplest of any cosmology... is that in which the universe is closed... has a finite lifetime... and collapses with the same kind of collapse... that a black hole does.
If it should turn out that indeed... the universe is limited in its life... how is that different from the life... of each one of us?
On the evening of Tuesday, March 5th... at about 10:45...
I was returning to my flat in Pinehurst.
It was dark and raining.
I came up to Grange Road... and saw headlights approaching... but judged that they were far enough away... that I could cross safely.
The vehicle must have been traveling very fast... for when I got just past the middle of the road... my nurse screamed, "Look out!"
I heard tires skidding... and my wheelchair was struck a tremendous blow in the back.
I ended up in the road... with my legs over the remains of the wheelchair.
The accident destroyed my wheelchair... and damaged my computer system... with which I communicate.
I required 13 stitches in my head... but I was able to go back to work several days later.
The memories I have are very much... kind of... visual pictures of what Stephen was... of seeing Stephen in certain situations.
He was always moving.
Always.
Well, hardly ever still.
It was the same thing about his face and gesture... which he used a great deal, I should say... but it's only memory.
I found some photographs recently... which reminded me of the general look of everybody... and I must say Stephen looked very much like he does now... if one thinks of him like that.
He does believe very intensely... in the almost infinite possibility of the human mind.
You have to find out what you can't know... before you know you can't, don't you?
So I don't think that thought should be restricted at all.
Why shouldn't you go on thinking about the unthinkable?
Somebody's got to start sometime.
Think how many things were unthinkable a century ago... and yet people have thought them.
And often they also seemed quite unpractical.
Not all the things Stephen says probably... are to be taken as gospel truth.
He's a searcher.
He's looking for things.
And sometimes he probably talks nonsense.
Well, don't we all?
But the point is... people must think.
People must go on thinking.
They must try to extend the boundaries of knowledge... and they don't sometimes even know where to start.
You don't know where the boundaries are, do you?
You don't know what your taking-off point is.
If we do discover a complete theory of the universe... it should in time be understandable... in broad principle by everyone... not just a few scientists.
Then we shall all... philosophers, scientists, and just ordinary people... be able to take part in the discussion of why it is... that we and the universe exist.
If we find the answer to that... it would be the ultimate triumph... of human reason... for then we would know... the mind of God.
Which came first... the chicken or the egg?
Did the universe have a beginning... and if so, what happened before then?
Where did the universe come from... and where is it going?
Luck.
Luck.
Well... we have been very lucky...
I mean, my family and Stephen and everybody.
You have your disasters, but the point is that we have survived.
Everybody has disasters, and yet some people disappear... and are never seen again.
Flying bombs are very alarming.
They came buzzing over... and then they would cut out.
And when you heard the bang, you knew it wasn't you... so you went back to your meal or whatever.
But one did fall quite close to our house... and it blew the back windows out... so that the glass was sticking dagger points all out of the opposite wall.
When Stephen was born, we decided... he'd better be born in Oxford.
So while I was staying in the hospital...
I went to Blackwell's in Oxford... and I bought an astronomical atlas.
One of my sisters-in-law said...
"This is a very prophetic thing for you to have done."
How real is time?
Will it ever come to an end?
Where does the difference... between the past and the future come from?
Why do we remember the past... but not the future?
I can remember the day... when we traveled through London and the blackout was over.
And the trains, instead of being shut in... by blinds so that you just traveled in a train... we were coming over one of the bridges... and all the lights...
well, such lights as were left... were on in London, but it was also a completely starry night... and you could see the light.
It was beautiful.
I remember we all used to lie on the grass, looking straight up through a telescope... and seeing the wonders of the stars.
Stephen always had a strong sense of wonder... and I could see that the stars would draw him... and further than the stars.
I was born exactly 300 years... after the death of Galileo.
I estimate that about 200,000 other babies... were also born that day.
I don't know whether any of them... was later interested in astronomy.
My first memory is of Isobel... pushing a rather antiquated... carriage-built pram along North Road... with Stephen and Mary in it... sort of looking very large... because they had large heads and pink cheeks, and they were very noticeable.
They all looked different from ordinary people.
I can remember visiting the Hawking home... oh, several times.
It was the sort of place where, if invited to stay to supper... you might, uh... be allowed to have your conversation with Stephen... but the rest of the family would be sitting... at the table reading a book... a behavior which was not really approved of in my circle... but which was tolerated from the Hawkings... because they were recognized to be... very eccentric, highly intelligent... very clever people... but still a bit odd.
My impression of the Hawking family was that they were all like that... except for Stephen, who seemed to be... the only normal member of the family.
Stephen used to reckon he knew, I think it was... 11 ways of getting into the house, and I could only find ten.
I'm not sure where the other way was.
On the north side of the house was a bicycle shed.
It had a door at the front and a door at the back.
Above that, there was a window into the L-shaped room... and at the front you could get sort of around the corner... onto the roof... and from that level... you could get onto the main roof.
I think one of the ways...
Stephen could get in was on the main roof.
As I say, he was a much better climber than I was.
I still didn't know what the 11th one was.
Before the 20th century... it was thought that the universe had existed forever... or had been created at some time in the past... more or less as we observe it today.
People found comfort in the thought... that even though they may grow old and die... the universe was eternal and unchanging.
I gave up playing games with Stephen... oh, when he was ill that time when he was about 12... because he started taking games terribly seriously.
We had Monopoly... and first of all... the Monopoly board sprang railways going across it... to add to the complications... and then Monopoly just wasn't adaptable enough.
He ended up with a fearful game called Dynasty... which, as far as I can make out...
I never played it... went on forever because there was no way of ending it.
It was almost a substitute for living, as far as I could make out.
It took hours and hours and hours.
I thought it was a perfectly terrible game.
I couldn't imagine anyone getting taken up with that.
But Stephen always had a very complicated mind... and I felt as much as anything... it was the complication of it that appealed to him.
When I was in high school, I learned that light... from distant galaxies was shifted to the red.
This meant that they were moving away from us... and that the universe was expanding.
But I didn't believe it.
A static universe seemed much more natural.
It could have existed... and could continue to exist forever.
We were discussing the possibility... of the spontaneous generation of life... and I think that Stephen made a remark... which indicated not only that he'd thought of this... but he'd even also... come across some calculations... as to how long it might take.
At that time, I think I made a comment... to one of my friends, John McClenahan...
"I think that Stephen... will turn out to be unusually capable."
I don't think I put it in quite those words... but I made some such remark to him... and he disagreed.
And so we made a bet on the subject.
In our childish way, we bet... a bag of sweets on the issue.
And incidentally, I reckon that my bet has come correct... and I think I'm entitled to payment... which has not yet been made.
The expansion of the universe... suggested the possibility... that the universe had a beginning... at some time in the past.
The point at which the universe may have started out... became known as the Big Bang.
The first year he was at St. Albans School... he came, I think, third from the bottom.
I said, "Well, Stephen... do you really have to be as far down as that?"
And he said, "Well... a lot of other people didn't do much better."
He was quite unconcerned.
Somehow he was always recognized... as being very bright... and in fact they gave him the Divinity Prize one year.
That was not surprising because his father used to read him...
Bible stories from a very early age... and he knew them all very well... and he was quite well-versed in religious things... although I don't think he makes a great deal of practice of it now.
Everybody used to argue theology.
That's a good, safe subject.
You don't need any facts or... distracting things like that.
If you go in for arguing... you know, debating... you can quite happily debate about anything... including theology... and the existence or otherwise of God.
And then someone gets bored... or Journey Into Space comes on, or something like that... and the argument breaks up.
In an unchanging universe... one can imagine that God created the universe... at literally any time in the past.
On the other hand... if the universe is expanding... there may be physical reasons... why there had to be a beginning.
An expanding universe does not preclude a creator... but it does place limits... on when he might have carried out his job.
When the family went to India... it was arranged that Stephen should come and live with us for a year.
He decided it would be nice... that we should have...
Scottish dancing in the evening.
Mind you, this was quite an ordinary house... but we had rather a lot of room and a large hall... and so we bought some records... and a book about what to do... and Stephen took charge.
And he insisted you put on a jacket and a tie.
And then he was the master of the proceedings.
And Stephen took it very seriously.
But then he liked dancing, you see?
There were four physicists in my year...
Gordon Berry...
Richard Bryan...
Stephen... myself.
I first remember Stephen... on an occasion when Gordon and I went up after dinner to his room... to try to find him.
And Stephen was up there... with a crate of beer... slowly drinking his way through it.
He was only 17.
He couldn't legally go into a pub.
He'd gone up to Oxford ridiculously early.
We used to have what we called a gathering net.
We used to organize a beer party and various things like that... to gather all these... collar as many freshman as we could get... to get them to join the Boat Club.
And that's how we collected him, you see?
But the question always with Stephen was...
"Should we make him the cox of the first eight... or the second eight?"
Well, coxes can be adventurous... and some coxes can be very steady people.
He was rather an adventurous type.
You never knew quite what he was going to do... when he went out with the crew.
I think he used to bring his work with him into the boat sometimes.
His sort of thinking gear was going... on different levels.
We were asked to read chapter 10... in a book called Electricity and Magnetism... by Bleaney and Bleaney, an unlikely combination... a husband-and-wife team... and at the end of that chapter, there were 13 questions... all of them final honors questions.
I discovered very rapidly that I couldn't do any of them.
Richard and I worked together for the week... and we managed to do 1 1/2 questions... which we felt very proud of.
Gordon refused all assistance... and managed to do one all by himself.
Stephen, as always, hadn't even started... but the next morning, he went up to his rooms at 9:00... and we came back about 12:00, maybe five past 12:00... and down came Stephen, and we were in the college gateway, the lodge.
"Ah, Hawking," I said, "how many have you managed to do, then?"
"Well," he said, "I've only had time to do the first ten."
I think at that point we realized that it's not just we weren't in the same street.
We weren't on the same planet.
I once calculated... that I did about 1,000 hours' work... in the three years I was at Oxford... an average of an hour a day.
I am not proud of this lack of work.
I am just describing my attitude at the time... an attitude that nothing was worth making an effort for.
He used to produce his work every week for tutorial... and, as he never kept any notes... or papers or that sort of thing... on leaving my room, he would normally throw it in my wastepaper basket.
And when he was with other undergraduates at the tutorial... and they saw this happen, they were absolutely horrified... 'cause they thought, he did this work in probably half an hour...
If they could have done it in a year, they wouldn't have thrown it in the wastepaper basket.
They would've put it in a frame on their walls.
Because of my lack of work...
I had planned to get through the final exam... by doing problems in theoretical physics... and avoiding any questions that required factual knowledge.
I didn't do very well.
I was on the borderline between a first- and second-class degree... and I had to be interviewed to determine which I should get.
They asked me about my future plans.
I replied, if they gave me a first...
I would go to Cambridge.
If I only got a second...
I would stay in Oxford.
They gave me a first.
I drove Stephen and his young brother... out to Woburn Park... and he climbed a tree.
He was testing himself out, I think.
I didn't realize.
He did manage to climb a tree... and go along a branch of it and get himself down.
I think he began to notice that his hands... were less useful than they had been... but he didn't tell us.
Univ has these square staircases... which are round but they're square.
It was just coming down from one of the rooms.
Steve actually fell on the stairs coming downstairs... and kind of bounced all the way down to the bottom.
I don't know if he lost consciousness, but he lost his memory.
We took him to either my room or someone's room.
The first question of course was, "Who am I?"
We told him, "You're Steve Hawking."
Right away he would ask again, "Who am I?"
"Steve Hawking."
Then, after a couple of minutes, he remembered he was Steve Hawking.
Then we'd say, "Do you remember going down to the bar... and having a drink on Sunday night?"
Or, "Do you remember coxing on the river on Monday?"
And his memory came back gradually... until he could remember the previous day's events, and then the previous hour... and by the end of the two hours, he could remember everything.
The question was, "Well, maybe you've lost... some of your mind because of this."
And so Steve decided, "Well, I'll take the Mensa test."
We said, "Of course you'll get in."
But he came back delighted he was able to get into Mensa.
Absolutely delighted.
I felt that there were two areas... of theoretical physics...
I might study at Cambridge.
One was cosmology, the study of the very large.
The other was elementary particles... the study of the very small.
However, I thought elementary particles... were less attractive... because there was no proper theory.
All they could do... was arrange the particles in families... like in botany.
In cosmology, on the other hand... there was a well-defined theory...
Einstein's general theory of relativity.
It was a very cold year... and the ice on Verulamium Pond... it was frozen there... and we all went skating.
And Stephen managed to skate fairly well... but then, he and I were close together.
He wasn't skating in a very advanced way... but nor was I, if it comes to that.
He fell... and he couldn't get up.
So I took him to a café to warm up... and he told me then all about it.
And it was diagnosed.
I insisted on going to see his doctor... because it seemed to me however long you're going to live... there's probably something someone can do about it... at least anyhow to make things easier for people.
I won't mention the doctor's name... but I got to see him at the London Clinic.
He was rather surprised that I should bother to come 'round to see him.
After all, I was only Stephen's mother.
He was quite nice.
He agreed to see me in a rather grand way.
And he said, "Yes, it's all very sad.
Brilliant young man cut off in the prime of his youth."
But of course I said, "What can we do?
What can we do to sort of...
Can we get physiotherapy?
Can we get anything like that that will help in any way?"
He said, "Well, actually, no.
There's nothing I can do, really.
More or less, that's it."
Shortly after my 21st birthday...
I went into hospital for tests.
They took a muscle sample from my arm... stuck electrodes into me... and injected some radiopaque fluid into my spine... and watched it going up and down with X-rays... as they tilted the bed.
I was diagnosed as having ALS... amyotrophic lateral sclerosis... or motor neuron disease, as it is also known.
The doctors could offer no cure... and gave me 2 1/2 years to live.
I went into the graduates' common room... looking, really, for someone to have lunch with.
There was nobody around that I particularly wished to have lunch with... and then Stephen walked through the door.
I don't know what he was doing at Oxford.
I've certainly forgotten now.
And so Stephen generously went off... to buy the drinks... and brought them and put them on the table.
And as he put his pint of beer down... he spilled it.
I sort of said genially...
"Oh, heavens.
Drinking at this time of day!"
He then told me he'd been in Addenbrooke's for three weeks... and they'd done a whole series of tests... and they'd decided... what was wrong with him.
And he told me very straight and flat... that he was gradually going to lose... the use of his body... that eventually... only his heart and his lungs... would still be operating, and his brain... and that they'd told him that... eventually he would essentially have the body of a cabbage... but his mind would still be in perfect working order... and he would be unable to communicate with the rest of the world.
My dreams at that time were rather disturbed.
Before my condition had been diagnosed...
I had been very bored with life.
There had not seemed to be anything worth doing.
But shortly after I came out of hospital...
I dreamt that I was going to be executed.
I suddenly realized there were a lot of worthwhile things...
I could do if I were reprieved.
I knew perfectly well that he had no faith... and... to me, that made it the more difficult... because you must ask yourself, "Why me?
Why this?
Why now?"
But he just totally, flatly accepted... that this was what was going to happen to him.
As far as I can gather, at that point he started to do some work.
At first, there did not seem much point... in working at my research... because I didn't expect to live long enough... to finish my PhD.
However, as time went by... the disease seemed to slow down.
I began to understand general relativity... and made progress with my work.
But what really made a difference was...
I had got engaged to a girl called Jane Wilde.
This gave me something to live for... but it also meant I had to get a job... if we were to get married.
Stephen was already ill.
Jane knew it.
And it was another instance of Stephen's luck, you know... meeting the right person at the right time... because Stephen was very, very badly depressed... and he wasn't very much inclined to go on with his work.
He'd been told he's only got 2 1/2 years.
What can you do in that time?
But meeting Jane really put him on his mettle... and he started to work.
I wanted to understand... how the universe began.
Einstein's theory of general relativity... showed that the universe was expanding.
But there was no answer to the crucial question...
"Must there have been a Big Bang... a beginning to time?"
Then, in my third year at Cambridge...
Roger Penrose made his discovery... about the death of stars.
I remember talking to this friend, Ivor Robinson... and we were having this animated conversation... and then we had to cross a road... and as we crossed the road, of course, the conversation stopped... and then we got to the other side.
Evidently, I had some idea crossing the road... but then the conversation started up, and it got completely blotted out of my mind.
It was only later, after my friend had gone home... and I began to have this strange feeling of elation... feeling wonderful.
I couldn't figure out why I should feel like that, so I went back over the day... thinking all possible things which might have contributed to such a feeling... and then gradually I unearthed this thought... which I'd had while crossing the street.
Penrose announced this result... that when stars collapse indefinitely... they will become singular... as long as some very broad conditions are satisfied... that everybody would have regarded as reasonable.
And I remember Stephen Hawking, who was then approaching... his third year as a research student, saying...
"What very interesting results.
I wonder whether they could be adapted... to understanding the origin of the universe."
And what he had in mind, you see, was that if, just mentally... you reverse the sense of time... you can think of the expanding universe as a collapsing system.
It's a bit like a very giant star collapsing.
Roger Penrose proved... that a dying star, collapsing under its own gravity... eventually shrinks to a singularity... a point of infinite density and zero size.
I realized that if I reversed the direction of time... so that the collapse became an expansion...
I could prove that... the universe had a beginning.
But my proof... based on Einstein's theory of general relativity... also showed that we cannot understand... how the universe began... because it showed that all scientific theories... including general relativity itself... break down at the beginning of the universe.
We had this meeting... at the Institute of Space Physics in New York.
I said, "Before we reach a final conclusion... we ought to throw into the pot... still another object... a gravitationally completely collapsed object.
Well, after you've used the phrase...
"a gravitationally completely collapsed object" ten times... you conclude you've got to get a better name.
So that's when I switched... to the word "black hole".
The word "black hole," which John Wheeler coined, suddenly caught on.
Everybody adopted it, and from then on... people around the world...
in Moscow... in America... in England and elsewhere... could know they were speaking about the same thing.
And not only that, but suddenly... the whole range of concepts got through to the general public... and even science-fiction writers all of a sudden... could talk about it.
Tonight, my friends... we stand on the brink of a feat unparalleled... in space exploration.
If the data on my returning probe ship... matches my computerized calculations...
I will travel where no man has dared to go.
Into the black hole?
In... through... and beyond.
Why, that's crazy!
Ha!
Impossible!
As a massive star contracts... its gravity becomes so strong... that light can no longer escape.
The region from which nothing can escape... is called a black hole... and its boundary is called the event horizon.
One might say of the event horizon... what Dante said of the entrance to hell...
"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here."
I was once asked to actually... be an adjudicator... on an essay of which the subject was...
"How to fall through a black hole and live."
Now, the problem I had was that I wouldn't know... how to give out the prize... because if I said, "That looks like a good essay"... the only real way of showing this was right... was to actually follow it, to do the experiment and fall in.
But then, having fallen in...
I would assume taking the person who wrote the essay with you... the question would be, how do you tell the rest of the world?
Do you take the prize in that you give to them... and what do they do with it when they get to the center?
Believe me...
I've been waiting a long time for someone like you... to record this moment.
Thank you, Doctor.
Then I'm ready.
Ready to embark on man's greatest journey.
Certainly his riskiest.
The risk is incidental compared to... the possibility to possess the great truth of the unknown.
There... long-cherished laws of nature... simply do not apply.
They vanish.
And life?
Life?
Life forever.
If you were watching an astronaut... foolhardy enough to jump into a black hole... at some time on his watch... say, 12:00... he would cross the event horizon... and enter the black hole.
But no matter how long you waited... you would never see the astronaut's watch reach 12:00.
Instead, each second on the watch... would appear to take longer and longer... until the last second before midnight... would take forever.
Thus, by jumping into a black hole... one could ensure that one's image lasted forever.
But the picture would fade very rapidly... and grow so dim that no one could see it.
As somebody disappears into a black hole... as seen from the outside, it looks as though... time actually slows down, and the person who's moving... at least he's thinking he's moving... he's perhaps talking in his spaceship at a normal rate... seems to slow down and ends up being frozen... in a particular position... as seen by somebody watching him from the outside.
And as seen from the outside, you never see what happens after that.
The astronaut wouldn't notice anything special... when his watch reached midnight... and he crossed the event horizon... into the black hole... until, of course, he approached the singularity... and was crushed into spaghetti.
One can fall through this event horizon... without feeling anything, without noticing it.
After about a week of falling, one begins to feel the pinch... and one extends longer and longer... and gets slightly thinner.
And, of course, one begins to get squeezed... until one gets very long and very thin... and rather nasty.
By the end of two weeks, one's fallen right into the center and is, of course, dead.
Before you lose sight of the outer world... you would see things happening and see them at a greater rate... so that it would look like a firework display.
The frustration would be that, although you would be able to see... everything that happens in the future, it would be going so fast... that from a scientific point of view, you'd have no time to analyze it.
You wouldn't be able to take it in.
Eventually things would be going off so fast... and it would be so explosive that you yourself would be... destroyed by the explosion, and that would be the end.
But it would be a very exciting way to end one's life.
It would be the way I would choose if I had the choice.
In the long history of the universe... many stars must have burned up their nuclear fuel... and collapsed in on themselves.
The number of black holes may be greater... than the number of visible stars... which totals about a hundred thousand million... in our galaxy alone.
We also have evidence... that there is a very large black hole... at the center of our own galaxy.
Friends ask me, "Well, if a black hole is black... how can you see it?"
And I say, "Have you ever been to a ball?
Have you ever watched the young men... dressed in their black evening tuxedos... and the girls in their white dresses... whirling around, held in each other's arms... and the lights turned low... and all you can see is the girls?
Well, the girl is the ordinary star... and the boy is the black hole.
You can't see the black hole any more than you can see the boy... but the girl going around gives you convincing evidence... there must be something there holding her in orbit."
One evening, shortly after the birth of my daughter, Lucy...
I started to think about black holes... as I was getting into bed.
My disability makes this rather a slow process... so I had plenty of time.
Suddenly I realized... that the area of the event horizon... must always increase with time.
The increase in the area of the event horizon... was very reminiscent of a quantity called entropy... which measures the degree of disorder of a system.
It is a matter of common experience... that disorder tends to increase with time... if things are left to themselves.
Jacob Bekenstein came into the office one day.
"Jacob," I said...
"It always troubles me... when I put a hot teacup next to a cold teacup.
I've increased, by letting heat flow from one to the other... the amount of disorder in the universe.
But Jacob, if a black hole swims by... and I drop both teacups into this...
I've concealed the evidence of my crime, have I not?"
Bekenstein's a man of great integrity... and he looked troubled, and he came back to me later... and he said, "No, you have not... concealed the evidence of your crime.
The black hole records what's happened to you."
Stephen Hawking read the paper... in which Bekenstein announced this result... thought it was preposterous... and decided to prove it was wrong.
My discoveries led Jacob Bekenstein to suggest... that the area of the event horizon... actually was the entropy of a black hole.
But there was one fatal flaw... in Bekenstein's idea:
If black holes have an entropy... they ought to have a temperature.
And if they have a temperature... they ought to give off radiation.
But how could they give off radiation... if nothing can escape from a black hole?
As it turned out...
Bekenstein was basically correct... though in a manner far more surprising... than he or anyone else had expected.
As he gradually lost the use of his hands... he had to start developing... carefully choosing research projects... that could be tackled and solved... through geometrical arguments that he could do pictorially in his head.
And he developed a very powerful set of tools nobody else really had.
So in some sense, when you lose one set of tools... you may develop other tools, but the new tools... are amenable to different kinds of problems than the old tools.
And if you're the only master in the world of these new tools... that means certain kinds of problems you can solve and nobody else can.
My work up to 1973... was in general relativity... and was summarized in a book I wrote with George Ellis called...
The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time.
Even then, it was difficult for me to write things down... so I tended to think in pictures and diagrams... that I could visualize in my head.
I remember visiting Stephen and Jane... at their home in Cambridge.
After supper in the evening... when it was time for Stephen to go to bed...
Jane insisted and Stephen acquiesced...
I guess this was standard... that Stephen make his way up...
I've forgotten whether it was one flight of stairs or two... alone... and this was a period when he could no longer walk.
The way he got up the stairs was, he grabbed hold of the pillars... that support the banister and pulled him up with the strength... pulled himself up the stairs with the strength of his own arms... dragging himself up... from the ground floor up to the second story... in a long, arduous effort.
Jane explained that... this was an important part of his physical therapy... to maintain his coordination... and strength as long as possible.
At first it was sort of heartrending... to watch what appeared to be the agony of pulling himself up the stairs... until I understood it's just part of life... pulling himself up the stairs like that.
General relativity is what is called... a classical theory.
It predicts a single definite path... for each particle.
But according to quantum mechanics... there is an element of chance or uncertainty.
A particle does not have... just a single path through space and time.
Instead, there is an uncertainty principle... according to which both the exact position... and velocity of a particle can never be known.
I began investigating... the effect quantum mechanics might have... on particles near a black hole.
I found that particles could escape... from a black hole... that black holes are not completely black.
At first I didn't believe it.
But when I redid the calculations...
I couldn't get the effect to go away.
I met Martin Rees, and he was shaking with excitement... and he said, "Have you heard?
Have you heard... what Stephen has discovered?
Everything is different!
Everything is changed!"
I was still unsure of my discovery... so I only told a few colleagues... but word soon spread.
Roger Penrose phoned up on my birthday.
He was very excited and went on so long... that my birthday dinner got quite cold.
It was a great pity, because it was goose... which I'm very fond of.
To me it's a miracle, 'cause it's a complicated and messy calculation.
We can now do these things very much better... and it's more transparent what happens.
But out of this messy calculation, he showed that black holes... aren't black with this quantum mechanical effect.
There was a residual radiation.
Stephen came to a meeting... and people were flabbergasted.
I remember someone saying, "You must be wrong, Stephen.
I don't believe a word of it."
I once said that I was unhappy... with the explanation given in terms of negative energy particles being created.
But I feel this is part of the controversy of science.
You must have the give and take, and I'm delighted to be a part of that.
That's what makes it fun.
If you all sat down and said, "Oh, lovely"... when you do have niggling questions in your mind... that's not doing a service to science.
But I was not antagonistic to it in any way... except for that one time when I questioned.
I finally convinced myself... that black holes radiate... when I found a mechanism through which this could happen.
According to quantum mechanics... space is filled with virtual particles... and antiparticles... that are constantly materializing in pairs... separating, coming together again... and annihilating each other.
In the presence of a black hole... one member of a pair of virtual particles... may fall into the hole... leaving the other member without a partner... with which to annihilate.
The forsaken particle appears to be radiation... emitted by the black hole.
And so black holes are not eternal.
They evaporate away at an increasing rate... until they vanish in a gigantic explosion.
Quantum mechanics has allowed particles and radiation... to escape from the ultimate prison... a black hole.
Einstein never accepted quantum mechanics... because of its element of chance and uncertainty.
He said, "God does not play dice."
It seems that Einstein was doubly wrong.
The quantum effects of black holes... suggest that not only does God play dice... he sometimes throws them... where they cannot be seen.
He says himself... that, uh... he wouldn't have got to where he is if he hadn't been ill.
And I think that's quite possible... because it's like Johnson said:
The knowledge you're to be hanged in the morning... concentrates the mind wonderfully.
And he has concentrated on this in a way...
I don't think he would have, because he took a great interest... in a lot of things in life... and I don't know that he'd have applied himself the same way... if he'd been able to get around as he used to do, so in a way...
No, I can't think anyone's lucky having an illness like that, even so.
But it's less bad luck for him than it would be for some people... because he can so much live in his head.
When I lived with the Hawking family, I would usually get up... around 7:15 or 7:30 and take a shower... and then read in my Bible some in the morning and pray... and then go down at 8:15 to get Stephen up.
And at breakfast I would often tell him what I'd been reading in the Bible... hoping that this would eventually have some influence.
So then we would go into work... and usually we'd go in and see if there were any scientific papers... that people sent out.
I did discover that despite Hawking's great brilliance, he does read quite slowly.
I could read about twice as fast as he.
But of course he would have to read to remember it... because it would be very difficult for him to go back and access the thing... whereas I could skim the paper rather quickly and see...
"Is there something interesting in this?"
If I wanted to work on it, I could pick the thing up and look at it.
Black hole radiation... has shown us that gravitational collapse... is not as final as we once thought.
If an astronaut falls into a black hole... he will be returned to the rest of the universe... in the form of radiation.
Thus, in a sense... the astronaut will be recycled.
However, it would be a poor sort of immortality... because any personal concept of time... would come to an end as he is torn apart... inside the black hole.
All that would survive... would be his mass, or energy.
One year, the Hawkings took me along... when we went to a cottage in Wales... near the River Wye... and this cottage was up a hill... and there was a bit of... a paved little sidewalk that went up to the cottage... which I had not been up, and of course...
I wanted to do it in the least number of trips I could imagine... so we put Stephen's batteries under his chair... his wheelchair has space for batteries...
and put extra batteries under there... which Stephen didn't realize that I'd put under there... so he didn't realize his wheelchair was as heavily laden.
Stephen got quite a bit ahead of me, and he was turning the corner... to go around to his house, but that was on a slope... so I looked up, and I noticed Stephen's wheelchair slowly tipping backward.
Of course, I was about ten meters away... and tried to run up there, but I was not able to get there... rapidly enough before he toppled backward into the bushes.
So it was a bit of a shocking sight... to see this master of gravity getting overcome... by the weak gravitational force of Earth.
One of the worst things for me would be having people there all the time.
Never alone.
I couldn't bear that.
And yet he finds things funny... and he enjoys life and he goes dashing about all over the place... and I think this is tremendous.
But it's a sort of courage I haven't got... and his father hadn't got it, and we cannot but admire it... but wonder how on earth he got it, really.
There must have been 50 people there... and I was standing off in a corner... sort of watching quietly... for a few minutes, relaxing... and Stephen was over there, not far from me.
Jane walked over to Stephen and looked at him.
He was sitting there with his head in his lap... like only Stephen can put his head in his lap.
And Jane said to Stephen...
"You look miserable, Stephen.
Sit up straight.
Some of your guests don't understand... that you're thinking about physics and having a wonderful time.
It looks like you're in pain.
Sit up and go talk to your guests."
In 1979...
I was elected Lucasian Professor of Mathematics.
This is the same chair once held by Isaac Newton.
They have a big book which every university teaching officer... is supposed to sign.
After I had been Lucasian Professor for about a year... they realized I had never signed.
So they brought the book to my office... and I signed with some difficulty.
That was the last time I signed my name.
My interest in the origin and fate of the universe... was reawakened when I attended... a conference on cosmology in the Vatican.
Afterwards, we were granted... an audience with the pope.
He told us that it was all right... to study the evolution of the universe... after the Big Bang... but we should not inquire into the Big Bang itself... because that was the moment of creation... and therefore the work of God.
I was glad that he did not know... the subject of the talk I had just given... the possibility that the universe had no beginning... no moment of creation.
There were theories in the early '70s...
the first type of creation theories... where the people concerned started off with a fixed, external space and time... which for eternity was empty... and then suddenly, for some unknown reason, the universe nucleates... at a particular point and then, bang, it blows apart.
But the trouble is that when space and time appear in the classical theory... that actual point itself is a singular point in the mathematics.
Mathematics breaks down, and so... you cannot use that to give you a creation theory.
If one goes back in time... one comes to the Big Bang singularity... where the laws of physics break down.
But there's another direction of time... that one can go in which avoids the singularity.
This is called the imaginary direction of time.
In imaginary time... there need not be any singularities... which form a beginning or end to time.
When you come to imaginary time, you have this rather peculiar possibility... of having a "now," as it were... without necessarily having a sort of a chain... of past moments.
If we start where we are at the moment and start running backwards in time... then for a long time, things work perfectly normally.
But as you begin to get further and further back towards... what would be the origin point in the conventional real-time picture... you'd find that the nature of time changes... that the imaginary component becomes more and more prominent... until what ought to have been the singular point in the classical theory... gets smoothed away, and you have this beautiful picture... of these bowls where the creation of the universe is pictures... of where we are now, and a smooth bowl of the past... where there's no initial point, just a sort of smooth shape.
So long as the universe had a beginning... we could suppose it had a creator.
But if the universe is completely self-contained... having no boundary or edge... it would neither be created nor destroyed.
It would simply be.
What place, then, for a creator?
All you can really say is that the universe is... because it's a self-consistent mathematical structure.
There's no past because, unlike the creation-as-a-point scenario... there's nothing for it to be created in.
So to say it's created from nothing is a bit of a misnomer.
It's a misleading use of the word "nothing".
It's not just that there was empty space in which the universe appeared, which you might call "nothing".
There was really nothing at all, because there wasn't even a creation event.
The use of a past tense in a verb becomes inappropriate in these theories.
Unfortunately, tenses were set up when people believed in real time, of course... and we don't yet have a linguistic form to describe tenses in imaginary time.
The word "time" was not handed down from heaven... as a gift from on high.
The idea of time is a word... invented by man... and if it has puzzlements connected with it... whose fault is it?
It's our fault.
Where does the difference... between the past and the future come from?
The laws of science do not distinguish... between the past and the future.
Yet there is a big difference... between the past and future in ordinary life.
You may see a cup of tea fall off a table... and break into pieces on the floor... but you will never see the cup gather itself back together... and jump back on the table.
The increase of disorder, or entropy... is what distinguishes the past from the future... giving a direction to time.
He fell ill in Switzerland.
When he came back, he was on a ventilator.
Because he's on a ventilator, you've got a tube down your throat... and therefore you can't speak, just for that reason.
For that period, which may have been a couple of months...
I spent probably one in two nights, one in three nights, at the hospital... because when he was in hospital... he couldn't communicate with the nurses.
It's not just like being seriously ill... but you're in a position where the nurses couldn't understand what Stephen wanted.
If Stephen was uncomfortable, they couldn't tell why.
Before I caught pneumonia... my speech had been getting more slurred... so that only a few people who knew me well... could understand me.
But at least I could communicate.
I wrote scientific papers... by dictating to a secretary... and I gave seminars through an interpreter.
And then, a tracheostomy operation... removed my ability to speak altogether.
After a long time...
well, it seemed like a long time... somebody came up with this brilliant gadget.
They didn't have it at the Cambridge hospital.
They got it from somewhere in London.
This was high technology... how you can communicate with a person with no voice.
It's a plastic piece of Perspex about so big... and you've got the letters of the alphabet arranged like that, and a hole in the middle.
You hold it up between you and the other person.
They look at a letter, and you can see which letter they're looking at... most of the time.
Sometimes you can't be sure.
So you would get the patient to spell out what they wanted.
So each letter...
they have to look to pick out the A.
You say, "A?" Did you get it right?
It's like a guessing game.
Stephen wasn't willing to accept that he wasn't going to speak again... and he thought he would be giving in... by trying to find a method of communicating other than speech.
I remember I went in one evening... and this was the first time that he asked... to be gotten out of bed to use the computer.
Sometimes they'd sit him up so he wasn't lying in bed all the time... as you do with a patient, but this time when I turned up... he asked the nurse, could he be gotten out of bed... so he could use the computer, and he did.
I remember the first thing he typed on there after saying hello...
Stephen's always very polite about things like that... was, "Will you help me finish my book?"
A computer expert in California... heard of my plight... and sent me a computer program... called Equalizer.
This allowed me to select words... from a series of menus on a screen... by pressing a switch in my hand.
These words could then be sent to a speech synthesizer... attached to my wheelchair.
Much to my surprise...
I found I was able to communicate... much better than before.
When eventually he went home from hospital... he was told he needed 24-hour nursing, and everyone was saying...
"How is he going to go in and do work?
Is he going to trail around with nurses after him in the office?"
And of course he did.
They talked originally of him working at home... which he wasn't happy with.
And so, after a period of recuperation at home... he just decided to go back into the office.
And he'd make the trip from his house to the office... which is, I don't know, half a mile in his wheelchair... with a nurse walking along with him.
This is at the time when he was still driving around... with the bag and the nasal drip... going into the department, working, going back home.
I began to wonder what would happen... when the universe stopped expanding... and began to contract.
Would we see broken cups... gather themselves together off the floor... and jump back onto the table?
Would we be able to remember tomorrow's prices... and make a fortune off the stock market?
It seemed to me... the universe had to return to a smooth and ordered state... when it recollapsed.
If this were so, time would go backwards... when the universe began to collapse.
People in the contracting phase would live their lives backward.
They would die before they were born... and get younger as the universe got small again.
Eventually, they would return to the womb.
He gave me my first problem to do.
He asked me to look at this mathematical problem.
Usually when he gives a problem, he has a good idea... of what the answer should be.
I went to look at it, and it took me a few months... to understand what it was about, and I came back and said, "I get this answer."
And he said to me, "No, that is not what I expected."
I said, "That's what I get." So I went to the blackboard, explained what it was.
He said, "Did you think about that particular case?" I said, "No, I didn't."
So I went back... and I calculated what he'd talked to me about.
I came back a few weeks after, and I said, "Stephen, I don't get this thing.
I still get the same answer I had originally."
So he said to me, "No, no, no, no.
This doesn't work.
Did you think about that?"
I said, "Oh, no.
I'd forgotten about that particular case."
So I went back to the drawing board and started calculating again... and again I got the same answer.
So I went back to see Stephen, and this dragged on for two or three months.
Finally he said to me...
"Maybe one of your approximations is not valid."
So me and a colleague decided to do the thing with computers.
This takes a lot of time to write the programs... and to be sure the program was correct.
We get the answer, and it was still the way I'd said before... and not the way Stephen said, so we went to see Stephen and said, "See?
Again."
I had made a mistake.
I had been using too simple a model of the universe.
Time will not reverse direction... when the universe begins to contract.
People will continue to get older... so it is no good waiting until the universe recollapses... to return to our youth.
Einstein once asked the question...
"How much choice did God have... in constructing the universe?"
If my proposal that the universe has no boundary is correct... he had no freedom at all... to choose how the universe began.
He would only have had the freedom... to choose the laws the universe obeyed.
This, however, may not have been... all that much of a choice.
There may well be only one unified theory... that allows for the existence of structures... as complicated as human beings... who can investigate the laws of the universe... and ask about the nature of God.
I don't know how clear-cut these experiments are... but there are experiments that have been done on the timing of consciousness... and they seem to lead to a very odd picture... which doesn't even quite make consistent sense.
Whether refinement of these experiments... might get rid of this kind of anomaly I'm not sure... but it does look a little as though there is something very odd about consciousness... and somehow almost as though the future affects the past in some way... over a very tiny, limited scale, but something maybe of the order... of a reasonable fraction of a second.
And there's no reason to believe... that one's conscious experience... shouldn't be part of somebody else's... at some other stage.
I don't know if it's fair to say what happens after one dies... but it's a plausible picture... that you could be somebody else... and that somebody else could be somebody that lived in the past, not in the future.
Even if there is only one possible unified theory... that is just a set of rules and equations... what is it that breathes fire into the equations... and makes a universe for them to describe?
Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing?
Is the unified theory so compelling... that it brings about its own existence?
Or does it need a creator?
And, if so... who created him?
I think I would say that the universe has a purpose.
It's not somehow just there by chance.
I think it's...
Yeah.
So... it's... it's...
Some people, I think, take the view that the universe is just there... and it sort of runs and runs, and it just sort of computes... and we happen somehow by accident to find ourselves in this thing.
But I don't think that's a very fruitful... or helpful way of looking at the universe.
I think that there is something much deeper about it.
In real time, the time in which we live... the universe has two possible destinies:
It may continue to expand forever... or it may recollapse and come to an end... at the Big Crunch.
It would be rather like the Big Bang... but in reverse.
I now believe that the universe will come to an end... at the Big Crunch.
I do, however, have certain advantages... over many other prophets of doom.
Whatever happens ten billion years from now...
I don't expect to be around to be proved wrong.
Of all the pictures that I know... the simplest of any cosmology... is that in which the universe is closed... has a finite lifetime... and collapses with the same kind of collapse... that a black hole does.
If it should turn out that indeed... the universe is limited in its life... how is that different from the life... of each one of us?
On the evening of Tuesday, March 5th... at about 10:45...
I was returning to my flat in Pinehurst.
It was dark and raining.
I came up to Grange Road... and saw headlights approaching... but judged that they were far enough away... that I could cross safely.
The vehicle must have been traveling very fast... for when I got just past the middle of the road... my nurse screamed, "Look out!"
I heard tires skidding... and my wheelchair was struck a tremendous blow in the back.
I ended up in the road... with my legs over the remains of the wheelchair.
The accident destroyed my wheelchair... and damaged my computer system... with which I communicate.
I required 13 stitches in my head... but I was able to go back to work several days later.
The memories I have are very much... kind of... visual pictures of what Stephen was... of seeing Stephen in certain situations.
He was always moving.
Always.
Well, hardly ever still.
It was the same thing about his face and gesture... which he used a great deal, I should say... but it's only memory.
I found some photographs recently... which reminded me of the general look of everybody... and I must say Stephen looked very much like he does now... if one thinks of him like that.
He does believe very intensely... in the almost infinite possibility of the human mind.
You have to find out what you can't know... before you know you can't, don't you?
So I don't think that thought should be restricted at all.
Why shouldn't you go on thinking about the unthinkable?
Somebody's got to start sometime.
Think how many things were unthinkable a century ago... and yet people have thought them.
And often they also seemed quite unpractical.
Not all the things Stephen says probably... are to be taken as gospel truth.
He's a searcher.
He's looking for things.
And sometimes he probably talks nonsense.
Well, don't we all?
But the point is... people must think.
People must go on thinking.
They must try to extend the boundaries of knowledge... and they don't sometimes even know where to start.
You don't know where the boundaries are, do you?
You don't know what your taking-off point is.
If we do discover a complete theory of the universe... it should in time be understandable... in broad principle by everyone... not just a few scientists.
Then we shall all... philosophers, scientists, and just ordinary people... be able to take part in the discussion of why it is... that we and the universe exist.
If we find the answer to that... it would be the ultimate triumph... of human reason... for then we would know... the mind of God.
A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME
Which came first?
The chicken or the egg?
Did the Universe have a beginning?
And if so, what happened before then?
Where does the Universe come from?
And where is it going?
Luck.
Luck, well
We have been very lucky.
I mean, my family, and Stephen, everybody
We had a few disasters, but the point is that we have survived
Everybody has disasters, and yet some people disappears and they're never seen again.
Flybombs were very alarming
Seeking, buzzing over, and then they would cut out.
And when you heard the bang, you knew it wasn't you, so you went back to your meal, or whatever.
But one did fall quite close to our house.
and it blew the back windows out so the glass was sticking dagger points out of the opposite wall.
When Stephen was born, we decided he'd better be born in Oxford.
So while I was staying in the hospital.
I went to Blackwells, in Oxford, and I bought an astronomical atlas.
One of my sisters-in-law said:
"This is a very prophetic thing for you to have done."
How real is time?
Will it ever come to an end?
Where does the difference between the past and the future come from?
Why do we remember the past but not the future?
I can remember that day when we travelled through London and the black-out was over.
And the trains, instead of being shut in by blinds, so you just travelled in a train.
We were coming over one of the bridges and all lights, well, such lights as were left were only in London.
but it was also a completely starry night
You could see the might whole against it.
I remember we all used to lie on the grass, looking staight up through a telescope and seeing the wonders of the stars.
Stephen always had a strong sense of wonder and I could see that the stars would draw him, and further than the stars.
I was born exactly 300 years after the death of Galileo.
I estimate that about 200 000 other babies were also born that day.
I don't know whether any of them was later interested in astronomy.
My first memory is about pushing a rather antiquated carriage built[?
] pram along North Road, with Stephen and Mary in it, sort of looking very large, because they had large heads and pink cheeks, and they were very noticeable.
They all looked diffrent from ordinary people.
I can remember visiting the Hawking home several times.
It was the sort of place where, if you were invited to stay to supper, you might be allowed to have your conversation with Stephen... but the rest of the family would be sitting at the table reading a book.
A behaviour which is not really approved over my circle, but which is tolereated from the Hawkings because they were recognised to be very excentric, highly intelligent, very clever people, but still... a bit... odd.
My impression of the Hawking family was that they were all like that, except for Stephen, who seemed to be the only normal member of the family.
Stephen used to reckon he knew, I think it was, 11 ways of getting into the house.
But I could only find 10 of them.
I'm not sure what the other way was.
On the north side of the house was bicycle shad had a door at the front and a door at the back.
Above that, there was a window into the L-shaped room.
And at the front you could get sort of round corner onto the roof
And from that level you could get onto the main roof.
I think one of the ways that Stephen could get in was on the main roof.
I must say he was a much better climber than I was.
I still don't know what the 11th one was!
Before the 20th century, it was thought that the Universe had existed forever, or had been created at some time in the past more or less as we observe it today.
People found comfort in the thought that even though they may grow older and die, the Universe was eternal and unchanging.
I gave up playing games with Stephen when he was ill that time about...
when he was about 12.
Becouse he started taking games terribly seriously.
We had Monopoly.
And... first of all the Monoply board sprang railways going across it... tried to add complications.
And then Monopoly just wasn't adaptable enough.
But he ended up with a fearful game called 'Dynasty' which, as far as I can make out, for I say, I never played it, went on forever, because there was no way of ending it!
It was almost a substitute for living as far as I could make out,
It took hours, and hours, and hours.
I thought it was a perfectly terrible game.
I couldn't imagine anyone getting taken up with that.
But Stephen always had a very complicated mind, and I felt as much as anything it was the complication of it that appealed to him.
When I was in high school,
I learned that light from distant galaxies was shifted at the red.
This meant that they were moving away from us and that the Universe was expanding.
But I didn't believe it.
A static Universe seemed much more natural.
It could have existed, and could continue to exist forever.
We were discussing the possibility of the spontaneous generation of life, and I think that Stephen made a remark which indicated not only that he thought of this, but he did even also come across some calculations as to how long it might take.
At that time I think I made a commen to one of my friends, John McLennahan:
"I think that Stephen will turn out to be unusually capable."
I didn't [say it] in quite these words but I made one such remark to him and he disagreed.
And so we made a bet on the subject.
In a childish way we bet a bag of sweets on the issue.
And instantly I reckon that my bet has come correct and I think I'm entitled to payment which is not yet been made.
The expansion of the Universe suggested a possibility that the Universe had a beginning at some time in the past.
The point at which the Universe may have started out became known as the Big Bang.
The first year he was at St. Albans school, he came, I think, third from the bottom.
So I said: "Well, Stephen,
"do you really have to be as far down as that?"
And he said: "Well,"
"lot of other people didn't do much better."
He was quite unconcerned.
Somehow he was always recognized as being very bright and in fact they gave him the Divinity Prize one year.
That was not surprising as his father used to reach him Bible stories from very early age and he knew them all very well and he was quite well versed in religious things although
I don't think he makes a very great deal of practice of it now.
Everyone used to argue theology.
That's a good safe subject.
You don't need any fact, sort of, or distracting things like that.
If you're going for arguing, you know, debating, you can quite happily debate about anything... including... theology and the existence of, or otherwise, of God.
And then someone gets bored, or
Journey Into Space comes on or something like that the argument breaks up.
In an unhcnaging Universe, one can imagine that God created the Universe at literally any time in the past.
On the other hand, if the Universe is expanding there are maybe physical reasons why there had to be a beginning.
An expanding Universe does not preclude a creator... but it does place limits on when he might have carried out his job.
When the family went to India, it was arranged that Stephen to come and live with us for a year.
He decided it would be nice that he should have
Scottish dancing in the evening.
Now mind you, this was quite an ordinary house, but we had rather a lot of room and a large hall, and so we bought some records, and a book about what to do, and Stephen took charge.
And he insisted to put on a jacket and a tie.
And then he was the master of the proceedings.
And Stephen took it very seriously
But then he liked dancing, you see.
There were 4 physicists in my year.
Gordon Berry,
Richard Bryath,
Stephen myself.
I first remember Stephen on the occasion when Gordon and I went up after dinner to his room, to try to find him.
And Stephen was up there with a crate of beer, slowly drinking his way through it.
He was only 17, he couldn't legally go into a pub.
He did come at Oxford ridiculously early.
We used to have what we called a "gathering net".
We used to organize that at beer parties and various things like that to gather under this cover as many freshman as we could get, you see get them to join the boat club.
And that's how we collected him, you see.
But the question, always, with Stephen, was
"Should we make him the cox of the first 8,"
"or the second 8?", you see?
Well, coxes can be adventurous.
But some coxes can be very steady people, you see.
He was rather an adventurous type.
You never knew could what he was going to do when he went out with the crew.
I think he used to bring his work there with him into the boat sometimes
Some thinking here was going on...
Different levels.
We were asked to read a chapter, chapter 10 in a book about electricity and magntism by Bleaney Bleaney, an unlikely combination of a husband and wife team.
And at the end of that chapter there were 13 questions, all of them final honours questions.
I discovered very rapidly that I couldn't do any of them.
Richard and I worked together for the week, and we managed to do one a half questions, which we felt very proud of.
Gordon refused all assistance and managed to do one all by himself.
Stephen, as always, hadn't even started.
But the next morning, he went up to his rooms at 9 o'clock, and we came back about 12, maybe five past 12, and down came Stephen, we were in the college gateway, the lodge,
"Ah, Hawking," I said, "how many have you managed to do then?"
"Well," he said:
"I've only had time to the first 10."
I think at that point we realised that it's not just we weren't in the same street, we weren't on the same planet.
I once calculated that I did about 1 000 hours work in the 3 years I was at Oxford.
An average of one hour a day.
I'm not proud of this lack of work.
I'm just describing my attitude at the time.
An attitude that nothing was worth making an effort for.
He used to produce his work every week for tutorial and, as he never kept any notes, or papers or that sort of things, on leaving my room he would normally throw it in my wastepaper basket.
And when he was with other undergraduates at the tutorial and they saw this happen they were absolutely horrified, 'cause they thought he did this work in probably half an hour, if they could have done it in a year
they wouldn't have thrown it in the wastepaper basket, they would have put in a frame up on their walls.
Because of my lack of work,
I had planned to get through the final exam by doing problems in Theoretical Physics, and avoiding any questions that required factual knowledge.
I didn't do very well.
I was on the borderline between a first and a second class degree.
And I had to be interviewed to determine which I should get.
They asked me about my future plans.
I replied if they gave me a first, I would go to Cambridge;
if only got a second,
I would stay in Oxford.
They gave me a first.
I drove Stephen and his young brother at Woburn Park.
And he climbed a tree; he was testing himself out, I think, I didn't realize.
And he did manage to climb the tree, and to go along a branch of it and to get himself down.
I think he began to notice that his hands were less useful than they had been, but he didn't tell us.
Uni has this square staircases which are round but they're square.
He was just coming down from one of the rooms
Steve actually fell on the stairs coming down the stairs and, he kind of bounced all the way down to the bottom.
I don't know if he loss conciousness, but he lost his memory.
We took him to either my room or someone's room.
The first question of course was:
"Who am I?"
and we told him: "You're Steve Hawking."
and a minute later or right away
He would ask: "Who am I?"
"Euh..
Steve Hawking."
And then after a couple of minutes he remembered he was Steve Hawking.
and we tell him: "Do you remember going down to the bar and having a drink"
"on Sunday night?"
Or: "Do you remember rowing, coxing on the river on Monday?"
And his memory came back gradually, until he could remember the previous days events and then the previous hour.
By the end of the 2 hours he could remember everything.
The question was: "Well maybe, you know, you lost some of your mind bacause of this"
And so, Steve decided: "Well, I'll take the Mensa test."
We said: "Of course you'll get into Mensa."
But he came back delighted that he was able to get into Mensa, absolutely delighted.
I felt that there were 2 areas of Theoretical Physics
I might study at Cambridge
One was Cosmology, the study of the very large.
the other was Elementary Particles, the study of the very small.
However, I thought that elementary particles were less attractive because there was no proper theory.
All they could do was arrange the particles in families, like in botany.
In Cosmology, on the other hand, there was a well defined theory:
Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.
It was very a very cold year and the ice on Veralamian pond was, it was all frozen then.
and we all went skating.
And Stephen managed to skate fairly well.
But then, he and I were closed together, he wasn't skating in a very advanced way, but nor was I as it comes to, and he fell and he couldn't get up.
So I took him to café to warm up and he told me then all about it
and it was diagnosed.
I've insisted on going to see his doctor because, it seemed to me, however long you're going to live there's probably something someone can do about it.
at least anyhow to make things easier for people.
And, I won't mention the doctor's name, but I got to see him at the London Clinic.
And he was rather surprised that I should bother to come down to see him.
I mean afer all I was only Stephen's mother!
He was quite nice, I mean, he agreed to see me in a rather grand way.
And he said: "Yes, it's all very sad, I mean, a brilliant young man, cut off in the prime of his."
But of course I said:
"What can we do?"
"What can we do to, sort of...
Can we give him... can we get physiotherapy?"
"Can we get anything like that that will help in any way?"
He said: "Well, actually no,"
"there's nothing to it", more or less.
That's it.
Shortly after my 21st birthday,
I went into hospital for tests.
They took a muscle sample from my arm, stuck electrodes into me, and injected some radio-opaque fluid into my spine and watched it going up and down with X-rays as they tilted the bed.
I was diagnosed as having ALS
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis... or motor-neuron disease, as it is also known.
The doctors offered no cure and gave me 2 and a half years to live.
I went into the graduates common room and looking really for someone to have lunch with and there was nobody around that I particularly wished to have lunch with and then learned about Stephen walk through the door.
don't know what he was doing in Oxford either, I've certainly forgotten that.
And so...
Stephen generously went off to buy the drinks and brought them over, put them down on the table, and as he put his pint of beer down, he spewed it.
And I sort of said, genially:
"Ah, haven't you been drinking at this time of day?"
and he then told me that he'd been in Edinburgh for 3 weeks and they'd done a whole series of tests and they decided what was wrong with him.
And he told me very straight and flat that he was gradually going to lose the use of all of his body.
And that eventually only his heart and his lungs would still be operating, and his brain.
And that they told him that, eventually, he would essentially have the body of a cabbage.
but his mind would still be in perfect working order, and he would be unable to communicate with the rest of the world.
My dreams at that time were rather disturbed.
Before my condition had been diagnosed,
I had been very bored with life.
There had not seemed to be anything worth doing.
But shortly after I came out of hospital,
I dreamt that I was going to be executed.
I suddenly realized that there were lots of worthwile things
I could do if I were retrieved.
I knew perfectly well that he had no faith.
And to me that made it more difficult, because you must ask yourself:
"Why me?
Why this?"
"Why now?"
But he just totally, flatly, accepted that this was what was going to happen to him.
And as far as I can gather at that point he started to do some work.
At first, there di not seem to be much time in working at my research, because I didn't expect to live long enough to finish my Ph.D.
However, as time went by, the disease seemed to slow down.
I began to understand General Relativity and make progress with my work.
But what really made a difference was
I got engaged to a girl called Jane Wilde.
This gave me something to live for, but it also meant that I had to get a job if we were to get married.
Stephen was already ill, Jane knew it.
And it was another instance of Stephen's luck.
Meeting the right person at the right time, because Jane...
Stephen was very very badly depressed.
And... he wasn't really very much inclined to go on with his work, I mean, you're told you got 2 and a half years, what can you do in that time?
But meeting Jane, really put him on his metal,
And he started to work.
I wanted to understand how the Universe began.
Einstein's theory of General Relativity showed that the Universe was expanding.
But there was no answer to the crucial question:
"Must there have been a Big Bang?"
"A beginning to time?"
Then, in my 3rd year at Cambridge
Roger Penrose made his discovery about the death of stars.
I remember talking to this friend, Ivor Robinson, and we were having some very animated conversation.
and then we had to cross the road, and as we crossed the road of course the conversation stopped, and then we got to the other side, well evidently I had some idea in crossing the road but then the conversation started up
and it got completely blotted out of my mind.
And it was only later, after my friends had gone home.
and I began having this strange feeling of [?
]elation, it feeling wonderful.
And I couldn't figure out why on earth I should feel like that, so I went back over the day, thinking all possible things which might have contributed to such a feeling, and then gradually I unearthed
this thought which I had while crossing the street.
Penrose announced this result, that when stars collapse indefinetly they will become singular as long as certain very broad conditions are satisfied that every body would have regarded as reasonable.
and I remember Stephen Hawking, who was then approaching his 3rd year as a research student, saying:
"What, very interesting results,"
"I wonder wehter they could be adapted"
"to understand the origin of the Universe."
and what he had in mind, you see, was that if, just mentally, you reverse the sense of time, you can think of the expanding universe as a collapsing system, it's a bit like a giant, a very giant star collapsing
Roger Penrose proved that a dying star collapsing under its own gravity eventually shrinks to a singluarity, a point of infinite density and zero size.
I realized that if I reversed the direction of time, so that the collapse become an expansion,
I could prove that the Universe had a beginning.
But my proof, based on Einstein's theory of General Relativity, also showed that we cannot understand how the universe began, because it showed that all scientific theories, incuding General Relativity itself, break down at the beginning of the Universe.
We had this meeting at the Institute of Space Physics in New York.
I said: "Before we reach a final conclusion,"
"we ough to throw into the pot"
"still another object:"
"a gravitationally completely collapsed object."
Well, after you've used the phrase:
"a gravitationally completely collapsed object"
ten times, you conclude you've get to get a better name, so that's when I switched to the word 'black hole'.
The word 'black hole', which John Miller coined, suddenly caught on.
Everybody adopted it and from then on people around the world, in Moscow,
in America, in England and elsewhere, could know they were speaking about the same thing.
And not only that, but suddenly the hole range of concept's got throught to the general public, and even science fiction writers all of a sudden could talk about it.
Tonight, my friends,
We stand on the break of a feat unparalleled in space exploration.
If the data in my returning probe ship matches my computerized calculations,
I will travel where no man has dared to go.
Into the black hole?
In...
Through...
And behind!
Why that's crazy!
Ah!
Impossible!
As a massive star contracts, its gravity becomes so strong that light can no longer escape.
The region from which nothing can escape is called a 'black hole' and its boundary is called the 'event horizon'.
One might say of the event horixon 49/ 00:32:16,658 -- 00:32:19,510 what Dante said of the entrance to Hell:
"Abandon all hope ye who eneter here."
I was once asked to actually be an adjudicator on an essay of which the subject was:
"How to fall into a black hole and live"
Now, the problem I had was that I wouldn't know how to give out the prize, because if I said: "Well, that looks like a really good essay", the only real way of showing that this was right
was to actually follow it, to do the experiment of fall in, but then having fallen in, also I would assume taking the person who wrote the essay with you, the question would be:
"How do you tell the rest of the world?"
Do you take the prize in with you that you'd give to him, and what do they do with it when do when get to the center?
Beleive me
I've benn waiting a long time for someone like you to record this moment.
Thank you, doctor.
Then, I'm ready.
Ready to embark on man's greatest journey.
Certainly his riskiest.
The risk is incidental compared to the possibility to possess the great truth of the unknown.
There, long cherished laws of nature simply do not apply.
They vanish.
And life?
Life?
Life forever.
If you were watching an anoustronaut fool hardly enough to jump into a black hole, at some time on his watch, say 12 o'clock, he will cross the event horizon and enter the black hole.
But no matter how long you waited, you would never see the astronaut's watch reach 12 o'clock.
Instead, each second on the watch would appear to take longer and longer until the last second before midnight would take forever.
Thus, by jumping into a black hole, one could ensure that one's image lasted forever.
But the picture would fade very rapidly and grow so dim that no one could see it.
When somebody disappears into the black hole as seen from the outside, you...
it looks like time actually slows down.
and the person becomes...
who's moving or at least he thinks he's moving and talking in his spaceship at a normal rate, seems to slow down and ends up by being frozen in a particular position as seen from somebody watching from the outside,
and as seen from the outside you never see what happens after that.
The astronout wouldn't notice anything special when his watch reached midnight and he crossed the event horizon into the black hole.
Until of course he approached the singularity and was crushed into spaghetti.
One can fall though this event horizon without feeling anything, without noticing it.
After about a week of falling, one begins to feel a pinch, and one extends longer and longer and gets slightly thinner and of course one begins to get squeezed, until one gets very long and very thin
and rather nasty.
By the end of two weeks one's fallen right into the center and one is of course dead.
Before you lose sight of the outer world, you would see things happening and you would see them at a greater rate so that it would look like a firework display.
And the frustration would be that, although you would be able to see everything that happens in the future, it would be going so fast from the scientific point of view, you would have no time to analyze it,
you wouldn't be able to take it in.
And eventually things would be going so fast and it would be so explosive that you yourself would be destroyed by the explosion and that would be the end.
But it would be a very exciting way to end one's life.
It would be the way I would choose if I had the choice.
In the long hisroty of the Universe, many stars must have burned up their nucelar fuel and collapsed in on themselves.
The number of black holes may be greater than the number of visibile stars, which totals about a hundred thousand million in our galaxy alone.
We also have evidence that there is a very large black hole at the centre of our own galaxy.
Friends ask me:
"Well, if a black hole is black, how can you see it?"
And i say: "Have you have you ever been to a ball?"
"Have you ever watched the young man dressed in their evening tuxedos"
"and the girls in their white dresses, whirling around, held in each other's arms?"
"And the lights turn low, and all you can see is the girls."
Well, the girl is the ordinary star and the boy is the black hole.
You can't see the black hole any more that you can see the boy, but the girl going around gives you convincing evidence there must be something there, holding her in orbit.
One evening, shortly after the birth of my daughter, Lucy,
I started thinking about black holes as I was getting into bed.
My disability made this a rather slow process, so I had plenty of time.
Suddenly, I realized that the area of the event horizon must always increase with time.
The increase in the area of the event horizon was reminiscent of a quantity called entropy, which measures the degree of disorder of a system.
It is a matter of common experience that disorder tends to increase with time if things are left at themselves.
Jacob Bekenstein came in at the office one day.
"Jakob," I said, "it always troubles me:"
"when I put a hot tea cup next to a cold tea cup, I've increased,"
"by letting heat flow from one to the other,"
"the amount of disorder in the Universe."
"But Jakob, if a black hole swirls by,"
"and I drop both tea cups into this,"
"I can seal the evidence of my crime, have I not?"
Bekenstein's a man of great integrity and he looked troubled, and he came back to me later and he said: "No, you have not concealed the evidence of your crime."
"The black hole records what's happened to you."
Stephen Hawking read the paper in which Bekenstein announced his result and thought it was preposterous and he decided to prove that he was wrong.
My dicoveries led Jacob Bekenstein to suggest that the area of the event horizon actually was the entropy of the black hole.
But there was one fatal flaw in Bekenstein's idea:
if black holes have an entropy, they ought to have a temperature.
And if they have a temperature, they ought to give off radiation.
But how could they give off radiation if nothing can escape from a black hole?
As it turned out, Bekenstein was basically correct, thought in a manner far more surprising than he, or anyone else, had expected.
As he gradually lost the use of his hands, he had to start developing... carefully chosing research projects that could be tackled and solved through geometrical arguments that he could do pictorially in his head.
and he developed a very powerful set of tools that noboby else really had so in some sense, when you lose one set of tools you may develop other tools, but to get new tools on a minimal to different kind of problems in your tools
and if you're the only master in the world of this new tools, that means certain kinds of problems you can solve and nobody else can.
My work up to 1973 was in General Relativity and was summurized in a book which I wrote with George Ellis called "The large scale structure of space-time".
Even then, it was difficult for me to write things down.
So I tended to think in pictures and diagrams Aussi, étais-je enclin à penser en images et en diagrammes that I could visualize in my head.
I remember visiting Stephen and Jane at their home in Cambrigde.
After supper in the evening when it was time for Stephen to go to bed
Jane instisted and Stephen acquiesced,
I guess this was standard, that Stephen make his way up.
I forgot whether there's one flight of stairs or two flight of stairs, alone and this was appearen that he can no longer walk.
the way he got up the stairs was he grabbed hold of the pillars that support the banister and pulled him up with the strenght of his own, pulled himself up the stairs by the strenght of his own arms,
dragging himself up from the ground floor up to the second storey in a long, arduous effort.
Jane explained that this was an important part of his physical therapy to maintain his coordination and strenght as long as possible.
at first, it was sort of hard renting[?
] to watch what appeared to be the agony of pulling up the starirs until I understood it was just part of life pulling himself up the stairs like that.
General Relativity is what is called a classical theory.
It predicts a single definite path for each particle.
But according to quantum mechanics, there is an element of chance or uncertainty.
A particle does not have just a single path through space and time.
Instead, there is an uncertainty principle according to which both the exact position and velocity of the particle can never be known.
I began investigating the effect of quantum mechanics might have on particles near a black hole.
I found that particles could escapoe from a black hole, that black holes are not completely black.
At first, I didn't believe it.
But when I ridid the calculations, I couldn't get the effect to go away.
I met martin Reese and he was shaking with excitement.
And he said: "Have you heard, have you heard!"
"What Stephen has discovered?
Everything is different!
everything is changed!"
I was still unsure of my discovery so I only told a few colleagues.
But word soon spread.
Roger Penrose phoned up on my birthday.
He was very excited and went on so long that my birthday dinner got quite cold.
It was a great pity because it was goose, which I'm very fond of.
To me it's a miracle, because it's a complicated and messy calculation.
we can now do these things very much better and it's more transparent what happens.
But out of this messy calculation, he showed that black holes aren't black.
With this quanto-mechanical effect which was a residual radiation.
Stephen came to a meeting and people were flabbergasted.
I remember someone getting up and saying:
"You must be wrong Stephen."
"I don't believe a word of it!"
I once said that I was unhappy with the explanation given in terms of negative energy particles being created.
But I feel this is part of the controversy of science.
You must have the give and take.
And I'm delighted to be able to be part of that.
I mean, it's what makes it fun.
You know, if you all sat down and said: "Oh, lovely!"
when you do have niggling questions in your mind that's not doing a good service to science.
But I was not antagonistic to it in any way, except for that one time when I questioned.
I finally conviced myself that black holes radiated when I found a mechanism through whcih this could happen.
According to quantum mechanics, space is filled with virtual particles and anti-particles that are constantly materializing in pairs, separating, coming together again and annihilating each other.
In the presence of a black hole, one member of a pair of virtual particles may fall into the hole, leaving the other member without a partner whith which to annihilate.
The forsaken particle appears to be radiation emitted bu the black hole.
And so, black holes are not eternal.
They evaporate away at an increasing rate until they vanish in a gigantic explosion.
Quantum mechanics has allowed particles and radiation to escape from the ultimate prison:
a black hole.
Einstein never accepted quantum mechanics because of its element of chance and uncertainty.
He said:
"God does not play dice".
It seems that Einstein was doubly wrong.
The quantum effects of black holes suggests that not only does God play dice, he sometimes throw them where they cannot be seen.
He says himself that he wouldn't have got where he is if he hadn't been ill.
And I think that's quite possible, because it's like Johnson said, you know:
"Knowledge to be hanged in the morning concentrates the mind wonderfully".
And he has concentrated on this in a way that I don't think he would have done because he always took a great interest in a lot of things in life and I don't know if he would have applied himself in quite the same way
if he'd been able to get around as is.
So in a way...
No, I can't think anyone's lucky of having an illness like that, even still, but it's bad less luck for him that it would be for some people, if you see what I mean,
because he can so much live in his head.
When I lived with the Hawking family I would usually get up around 7h15 or 7h30, and take a shower and then read my bible some in the morning and pray.
And then I would go down at 8h15 to get Stephen up.
And then at breakfast I would often tell him what I'd been reading in the bible hoping that, you know, maybe this would eventually have some influence.
So then we would get into work and usually we'd go and see if there were any scientific papers that people sent out and.
I did discover that despite Hawking's great brains he reads quite slowly.
I mean, I can read about twice as fast as him.
But of course, the point is he would have to read to memory because it would be very difficult for him to go back and access the thing.
Wherheas I can skim the paper rather quickly and see if there was anything interesting in it and if I wanted to work on it
I can pick the thing up and look at it.
Black hole radiation has shown us that gravitational collapse is not as final as we once thought.
If an astronaut falls into a black hole, he will be returned to the rest of the Universe in the form of radiation.
Thus, in a sense, the astronaut will be recycled.
However, it would be a poor sort of immortality because any personal concept of time would come to an end as he is torn apart inside a black hole.
All that would survive would be his mass, or energy.
One year the Hawkings took me along when we went to a cottage in Wales near the river Wye.
And this cottage was up a hill and there was a bit of a paved, well, sidewalk that went up to the cottage which I had not been up.
And of course I wanted to do it in the least number of trips that I could imagine, so we put Stephen's batteries under his chair, I mean his wheelchair has space for batteries, and put extra batteries under there, which we...
Stephen didn't realize he had...
that I put under there, he didn't realize his chair was as heavily laden as possible.
So Stephen was quite a bit ahead of me and then he was turning the corner to go on to... around to his house, but that was on a slope and...
So I looked up and I noticed
Stephen's wheelchair was slowly tipping backward.
And of course that was about 10 meters away.
I tried to roll up there but of course I wasn't able to get there nearly rapidly enough before he've toppled over backward into the bushes.
And this was a bit of a shocking sight, to see this master of gravity getting overcome by the weak gravitational force of Earth!
One of the worst things for me would be having people there all the time, never alone I reckon, really.
And yet he finds thigs funny and he enjoys life and he goes dashing about all over the place.
And I think this is tremendous, that this is the sort of courage I haven't got, that his father hadn't got.
And we cannot but admire it, but I wonder how on earth he got it, really!
There must have been 50 people there and I was standing off in a corner, sort of, watching quietly for a few minutes, relaxing.
And Stephen was not far from me.
Jane walked over to Stephen and looked at him and he was sitting with his head on his lap, like only Stephen can put his head in his lap, and Jane said to Stephen:
"You look miserable Stephen!"
Sit up straight!"
"Some of your guests don't understand"
"that you're sitting there thinking about physics and having a wonderful time,"
"it looks like you're in pain.
Sit up straight and go talk to your guests."
In 1979, I was elected Lucasian Professor of Mathematics.
This is the same chair once held by Isaac Newton.
They a have a big book which every university teaching officer is supposed to sign.
After I had been Lucasian Professor for about a year they realized I had never signed.
So they brought the book to my office and I signed it with some difficulty.
That was the last time I signed my name.
My interest in the origin and fate of the Universe was reawakened when I attended a conference on cosmology in the Vatican.
Afterwards, we were granted an audience with the pope.
He told us that it was all right to study the evolution of the Universe after the Big Bang,
but we should not inquire into the Big Bang itself, because that was the moment of creation, and therefore, the work of God.
I was glad that he did not know the subject of the talk I had just given:
the possibility that the Universe had no beginning, no moment of creation.
There were theories in the early 70s, in fact the first type of creation theories, where the people concerned started off with a fixed external space and time which for eternity was empty.
Then suddenly, for some unknown reason, Universe nucleates in a point and then Bang!
It blows apart.
But the trouble is that when the space and time appear in the classical theory the actual point itself is a singualr point in the mathematics.
Mathematics breaks down, and so you cannot in fact use that to give you a creation theory.
If one goes back in time, one comes to the Big Bang singularity, where then laws of Physics break down.
But there's another direction of time that one can go in, which avoids the singularity.
This is called the imaginary direction of time.
In imaginary time, there need not be any sigularities which form a beginning or end to time.
When you come to imaginary time, you have this rather peculiar possibility of having a 'now', as it were, not necessarily having a sort of a chain of past moments.
If we start to lay out the moments that run in backwards in time, as it were, then for a long time things work perfectly normally.
But then as you begin to get further and furhter back towards what would be the origin point in a conventional real time picture you'd find that the nature of time changes, that the imaginary component becomes more and more prominent,
and in the end, what ought be a singular point in the classical theory just gets smoothed away s'estompe and you have this beautiful picture, this bowls, where the creation of the Universe is pictured, as where we are now
in a smooth sort of bowl past where there's no initial point, just a sort of smooth shape.
So long as the Universe had a beginning, we could suppose it had a Creator.
But if the Universe is completely self-contained, having no boudary or edge,
it would neither be created nor destroyed, it would simply be.
What place then, for a Creator?
What we can really say is that the Universe is, bacuse it is a self-consistent mathematical structure.
There's no past because, unlike the creation point scenario there's nothing for it to
So to say it's created from nothing is actually a bit of a misnomer, it's a misleading use of the word 'nothing'.
It's not just that there was empty space in which the Universe appeared, which you might call 'nothing', there was really nothing at all because there wasn't even a creation event, you see.
The use of past tense in a verb becomes inappropriate in these theories.
Unfortunately, tenses were set up when people believed in real time, of course, and we don't yet have a linguistic form to describe tenses in imaginary time.
The word 'time' was not handed down from Heaven, as a gift from On High.
The idea of 'time' is a word inventend my men, and if it has puzzlements connected with it, whose fault is it?
It's our fault!
Where does the difference between the past and the future come from?
The laws of science do not distinguish between the past and the future.
Yet, there is a big difference between the past and future in ordinary life.
You may see a cup of tea fall off a table and break into peaces on the floor, but you will never see a cup gather together and jump back on the table.
The increase of disorder or entropy is what distiguishes the past from the future, giving the direction to time.
He fell ill in Switzerland.
When he came back, he was on a ventilator.
Because he was on a ventilator, you've got a tube down you throat, and therefore you can't speak, just for that reason.
For that period, which might have been a couple of months,
I spent probably one in two nights, one in three nights, at the hospital, because when he was in hospital he couldn't communicate with the nurses.
And it's not just like being seriously ill, but you're in a position where the nurses couldn't understand what Stephen wanted.
If Stephen was unconfortable, they couldn't tell why.
Before I caught pneumonia, my speech had been getting more slurred so that only a few people who knew me well could understand me.
But at least I could communicate.
I wrote scientific papers by dictating to a secretary and I gave seminars through an interpreter.
And then, a tracheotomy operation removed my ability to speak altogether.
After a long time, well it seemed like along time, somebody came up with this brilliant gadget.
They didn't have it in Cambridge hosptal, they got it from somewhere in London.
This was high technology:
how can you communicate with a person with no voice?
It's plastic piece of Perspex, about so big, and you've got the letters of the alphabet arranged like that and a hole in the middle.
You hold it up between you and the other person and they look at a letter, and you can see of course which letter they're looking at, most of the time, sometimes you can't quite be sure,
and so you get the patient to spell out what they wanted, you know, so each letter you have to look:
speak out the A, and you say: "A?" You get it right.
It's like a guessing game.
Stephen wasn't going to accept that he wasn't going to speak again and he thought that he would be giving in by trying to find a method of communicating without speech.
And I remember I went to him one evening, and this was the first time that he asked to be gotten out of bed to use a computer.
Sometimes, they were sitting him up so that he wasn't lying in the bed all the time, as you do with a patient, but this time, when I turned up, he asked the nurse could he be gotten out of bed
so he could use the computer, and he did.
I remember the first thing he typed in there, after saying 'hello',
-Stephen's always being very polite about things like that- was: "Will you help me finish my book?"
A computer expert in California heard of my plight and sent me a computer program called Equalizer.
This allowed me to select words from a series of menus on a screen by pressing a switch in my hand.
These words could then be sent to a speech synthesizer attached to my wheelchair.
Much to my surprise,
I found I was able to communicate much better than before.
When eventually he went home from hospital, and he was told he needed 24h nursing, and everyone was saying:
"Well, how is he gonna go in and do work,"
"is he going to trail around with a series of nurses after him working in the office?"
And of course he did!
I mean, they talked originally of him working at home, which he wasn't happy with,
so after a period of recuperation home he just decided to go back into the office, and he made the trip Il faisait donc le trajet from his house to the office which is, I don't know, half a mile, in his wheelchair,
And the nurses were walking along with him.
And this is at the time when he was still driving around with a bag and a nasal drip[?
].
Going into the department, working, going back home.
I began to wonder what would happen when the Universe stopped expanding and began to contract.
Would we see broken cups gather themselves together off the floor and jump back on to the table?
Would we be able to remember tomorrow's prices and make a fortune off the stock market?
It seemed to me the Universe had to return to a smooth and ordered state when it recollapsed.
If this were so, time would go backwards when the Universe began to collapse.
People in the contracting phase would live their lives backwards, they would die before they were born and get younger as the Universe got small again.
Eventually, they would return to the womb.
He gave me my first problem to do.
He asked me to look at this mathematical problem and ususally, when he gives a problem, he has a good idea of what the answer should be.
And I went to look at it and it took me a few months to understand what was it about and I came back and I said:
"Stephen I get this answer."
And he said to me: "No, that is not what I expected."
I said: "Stephen that's what I get."
And so I went to the blackboard, explained to him what it was.
He said: "Did you think about that particular case?"
I said: "Oh no I didn't!"
So I went back
I calculated what he talked to me about, came back a few weeks after and I said:
"Stephen, I don't get this thing.
I still get the same answer I had originally."
So he said to me:
"No no no, this is not right,"
"did you think about that?" "Oh no!"
"I'd forgotten about that particular case."
So I went back to the drawing board, started calculating again.
And again, get the same answer!
I went back to see Stephen, and this dragged on for about 2 or 3 months.
Finally he said to me: "Maybe,"
"one of you approximations isn't valid."
So me and a collegue decided to do this thing with computers, and than this takes a lot of time to write the programs and to be sure the program was correct...
We get the answer and it was still the way that I said before and not the way that Stephen has said, so we went to see Stephen and we said: "You see?
Again!"
I had make a mistake.
I had been using too simple a model of the Universe.
Time will not reverse direction when the Universe begins to contract.
People will continue to get older, so it is no good waiting until the universe recollapses to return to our youth.
Einstein once asked a question:
"How much choice did God have in constructing the Universe?"
If my proposal that the universe has no boundary is correct, he had no freedom at all to choose how the Universe began.
He would only had had a freedom to choose the laws the Universe obeyed.
This, however, may not have been all that much of a choice.
They may be well be only one unified theory that allows for the existence of structures as complicated as human beings, who can investigate the laws of the Universe and ask about the nature of God.
I don't know how clear-cut these experiments are, but there are experiments that have been done on, sort of, timing of conciousness, and they seem to lead to a very odd picture which doesn't even quite make consistent sense.
Whether refinement of these experiments might actually get rid of this kind of anomaly
I'm not sure, but it does look a little as though there's something very odd about conciousness, and somehow almost as though future affects the past in some way over a very tiny limited scale but something maybe of the order of a reasonable fraction of a second.
And there's no reason to believe that one's conscious experience shouldn't be part of somebody else's at some other stage, I mean.
I don't if it's fair to say what happens after one dies but you could... it's a plausible picture that you could be sombody else.
And that somebody else could be somebody who lived in the past, not in the future.
If there's only one possible unified theory that is just a set of rules and equations,
what is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a Universe for them to describe?
Why does the Universe go to all the bother of existing?
Is the unified theory so compelling that it brings about its own existence?
Or does it need a Creator?
And if so, who created Him?
I think I would say that the Universe has a purpose, it's not somehow just there by chance,
I mean, I think it's...
Some people, I think, take the view that the Universe is just there and it sort of rumbles along and it just sort of computes, we happen somehow by accident and found ourselves in this thing.
But I don't think that's a very fruitful or helpful way of looking at the Universe.
I think that there's something much deeper about it.
In real time, the time in which we live, the Universe has two possible destinies:
it may continue to expand forever, or it may recollapse and come to an end at a Big Crunch.
It would be rather like the big Bang, but in reverse.
I now believe that the Universe will come to an end at a Big Crunch.
I do, however, have certain advantages over many other prophets of doom:
whatever happens 10 billion years from now,
I don't expect to be around to be proved wrong.
Of all the pictures that I know, the simplest of any cosmology is that in which the Universe is closed, has a finite lifetime, and collapses with the same kind of collapse that a black hole does.
If it should turn out that indeed the Universe is limited in its life, how is that different from the life of each one of us?
On the evening of Tuesday, March 5th, at about 10h45,
I was returning to my flat in Pinehurst.
It was dark and raining.
I came up to Grange Road and saw headlights approaching, but judged that they were far enough away that I could cross safely.
The vehicle must have been travelling very fast, for when I got just past the middle of the road, my nurse screamed:
"Look out!"
I heard tires skidding and my wheelchair was struck a tremendous blow in the back.
I ended up in the road, with my legs over the remains of the wheelchair.
The accident destroyed my wheelchair and damaged my computer system with which I communicate.
I required 13 stitches in my head, but I was able to go back to work several days later.
The memories I have are very much, kind of, visual pictures of what Stephen was.
I've seen Stephen in certains situations.
He was always moving, always.
He was hardly ever still.
It was the same thing about his face and gestures, which he used a great deal, I should say.
But it's only memory.
I found some photographs recently which reminded me of the general look of everybody.
I must say Stephen looked very much as he does now.
If one thinks of him like that.
He does believe very intensely in almost infinite possibility of the human mind.
You have to find out what you can't know before you know you can't, don't you?
So I don't think that thought should be restricted at all, and there's... why shouldn't you go on thinking about the unthinkable?
Somebody's got to start sometime.
I mean, think how many things were unthinkable a century ago.
And yet people have thought them.
And often they seemed quite impractical.
Not all things Stephen says probably are to be taken as Gospel.
truth is, he's a searcher, he's looking for things and if he is sometimes, he probably talks nonsense as we all... but the point is:
people must think.
People must go on thinking.
They must try to extend the boundaries of knowledge, and they don't sometimes even know where to start.
We don't know where the boundaries are, do we?
We don't know what the taking off point is.
If we do discover a complete theory of the Universe, it should, in time, be understandable, in broad principle, by everyone, not just a few scientists.
Then we shall all, phylosophers, scientists and just ordinary people, be able to take part in the discussion on why it is that we, and the Universe, exist.
If we find the answer to that, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason.
For then we would know the mind of God.
A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME
Which came first?
The chicken or the egg?
Did the Universe have a beginning?
And if so, what happened before then?
Where does the Universe come from?
And where is it going?
Luck.
Luck, well
We have been very lucky.
I mean, my family, and Stephen, everybody
We had a few disasters, but the point is that we have survived
Everybody has disasters, and yet some people disappears and they're never seen again.
Flybombs were very alarming
Seeking, buzzing over, and then they would cut out.
And when you heard the bang, you knew it wasn't you, so you went back to your meal, or whatever.
But one did fall quite close to our house.
and it blew the back windows out so the glass was sticking dagger points out of the opposite wall.
When Stephen was born, we decided he'd better be born in Oxford.
So while I was staying in the hospital.
I went to Blackwells, in Oxford, and I bought an astronomical atlas.
One of my sisters-in-law said:
"This is a very prophetic thing for you to have done."
How real is time?
Will it ever come to an end?
Where does the difference between the past and the future come from?
Why do we remember the past but not the future?
I can remember that day when we travelled through London and the black-out was over.
And the trains, instead of being shut in by blinds, so you just travelled in a train.
We were coming over one of the bridges and all lights, well, such lights as were left were only in London.
but it was also a completely starry night
You could see the might whole against it.
I remember we all used to lie on the grass, looking straight up through a telescope and seeing the wonders of the stars.
Stephen always had a strong sense of wonder and I could see that the stars would draw him, and further than the stars.
I was born exactly 300 years after the death of Galileo.
I estimate that about 200 000 other babies were also born that day.
I don't know whether any of them was later interested in astronomy.
My first memory is about pushing a rather antiquated carriage built[?
] pram along North Road, with Stephen and Mary in it, sort of looking very large, because they had large heads and pink cheeks, and they were very noticeable.
They all looked different from ordinary people.
I can remember visiting the Hawking home several times.
It was the sort of place where, if you were invited to stay to supper, you might be allowed to have your conversation with Stephen... but the rest of the family would be sitting at the table reading a book.
A behaviour which is not really approved over my circle, but which is tolerated from the Hawkings because they were recognised to be very eccentric, highly intelligent, very clever people, but still... a bit... odd.
My impression of the Hawking family was that they were all like that, except for Stephen, who seemed to be the only normal member of the family.
Stephen used to reckon he knew, I think it was, 11 ways of getting into the house.
But I could only find 10 of them.
I'm not sure what the other way was.
On the north side of the house was bicycle shad had a door at the front and a door at the back.
Above that, there was a window into the L-shaped room.
And at the front you could get sort of round corner onto the roof
And from that level you could get onto the main roof.
I think one of the ways that Stephen could get in was on the main roof.
I must say he was a much better climber than I was.
I still don't know what the 11th one was!
Before the 20th century, it was thought that the Universe had existed forever, or had been created at some time in the past more or less as we observe it today.
People found comfort in the thought that even though they may grow older and die, the Universe was eternal and unchanging.
I gave up playing games with Stephen when he was ill that time about...
when he was about 12.
Because he started taking games terribly seriously.
We had Monopoly.
And... first of all the Monopoly board sprang railways going across it... tried to add complications.
And then Monopoly just wasn't adaptable enough.
But he ended up with a fearful game called 'Dynasty' which, as far as I can make out, for I say, I never played it, went on forever, because there was no way of ending it!
It was almost a substitute for living as far as I could make out,
It took hours, and hours, and hours.
I thought it was a perfectly terrible game.
I couldn't imagine anyone getting taken up with that.
But Stephen always had a very complicated mind, and I felt as much as anything it was the complication of it that appealed to him.
When I was in high school,
I learned that light from distant galaxies was shifted at the red.
This meant that they were moving away from us and that the Universe was expanding.
But I didn't believe it.
A static Universe seemed much more natural.
It could have existed, and could continue to exist forever.
We were discussing the possibility of the spontaneous generation of life, and I think that Stephen made a remark which indicated not only that he thought of this, but he did even also come across some calculations as to how long it might take.
At that time I think I made a comment to one of my friends, John McLennahan:
"I think that Stephen will turn out to be unusually capable."
I didn't [say it] in quite these words but I made one such remark to him and he disagreed.
And so we made a bet on the subject.
In a childish way we bet a bag of sweets on the issue.
And instantly I reckon that my bet has come correct and I think I'm entitled to payment which is not yet been made.
The expansion of the Universe suggested a possibility that the Universe had a beginning at some time in the past.
The point at which the Universe may have started out became known as the Big Bang.
The first year he was at St. Albans school, he came, I think, third from the bottom.
So I said: "Well, Stephen,
"do you really have to be as far down as that?"
And he said: "Well,"
"lot of other people didn't do much better."
He was quite unconcerned.
Somehow he was always recognized as being very bright and in fact they gave him the Divinity Prize one year.
That was not surprising as his father used to reach him Bible stories from very early age and he knew them all very well and he was quite well versed in religious things although
I don't think he makes a very great deal of practice of it now.
Everyone used to argue theology.
That's a good safe subject.
You don't need any fact, sort of, or distracting things like that.
If you're going for arguing, you know, debating, you can quite happily debate about anything... including... theology and the existence of, or otherwise, of God.
And then someone gets bored, or
Journey Into Space comes on or something like that the argument breaks up.
In an unchanging Universe, one can imagine that God created the Universe at literally any time in the past.
On the other hand, if the Universe is expanding there are maybe physical reasons why there had to be a beginning.
An expanding Universe does not preclude a creator... but it does place limits on when he might have carried out his job.
When the family went to India, it was arranged that Stephen to come and live with us for a year.
He decided it would be nice that he should have
Scottish dancing in the evening.
Now mind you, this was quite an ordinary house, but we had rather a lot of room and a large hall, and so we bought some records, and a book about what to do, and Stephen took charge.
And he insisted to put on a jacket and a tie.
And then he was the master of the proceedings.
And Stephen took it very seriously
But then he liked dancing, you see.
There were 4 physicists in my year.
Gordon Berry,
Richard Bryath,
Stephen myself.
I first remember Stephen on the occasion when Gordon and I went up after dinner to his room, to try to find him.
And Stephen was up there with a crate of beer, slowly drinking his way through it.
He was only 17, he couldn't legally go into a pub.
He did come at Oxford ridiculously early.
We used to have what we called a "gathering net".
We used to organize that at beer parties and various things like that to gather under this cover as many freshman as we could get, you see get them to join the boat club.
And that's how we collected him, you see.
But the question, always, with Stephen, was
"Should we make him the cox of the first 8,"
"or the second 8?", you see?
Well, coxes can be adventurous.
But some coxes can be very steady people, you see.
He was rather an adventurous type.
You never knew could what he was going to do when he went out with the crew.
I think he used to bring his work there with him into the boat sometimes
Some thinking here was going on...
Different levels.
We were asked to read a chapter, chapter 10 in a book about electricity and magnetism by Bleaney Bleaney, an unlikely combination of a husband and wife team.
And at the end of that chapter there were 13 questions, all of them final honours questions.
I discovered very rapidly that I couldn't do any of them.
Richard and I worked together for the week, and we managed to do one a half questions, which we felt very proud of.
Gordon refused all assistance and managed to do one all by himself.
Stephen, as always, hadn't even started.
But the next morning, he went up to his rooms at 9 o'clock, and we came back about 12, maybe five past 12, and down came Stephen, we were in the college gateway, the lodge,
"Ah, Hawking," I said, "how many have you managed to do then?"
"Well," he said:
"I've only had time to the first 10."
I think at that point we realised that it's not just we weren't in the same street, we weren't on the same planet.
I once calculated that I did about 1 000 hours work in the 3 years I was at Oxford.
An average of one hour a day.
I'm not proud of this lack of work.
I'm just describing my attitude at the time.
An attitude that nothing was worth making an effort for.
He used to produce his work every week for tutorial and, as he never kept any notes, or papers or that sort of things, on leaving my room he would normally throw it in my wastepaper basket.
And when he was with other undergraduates at the tutorial and they saw this happen they were absolutely horrified, 'cause they thought he did this work in probably half an hour, if they could have done it in a year
they wouldn't have thrown it in the wastepaper basket, they would have put in a frame up on their walls.
Because of my lack of work,
I had planned to get through the final exam by doing problems in Theoretical Physics, and avoiding any questions that required factual knowledge.
I didn't do very well.
I was on the borderline between a first and a second class degree.
And I had to be interviewed to determine which I should get.
They asked me about my future plans.
I replied if they gave me a first, I would go to Cambridge;
if only got a second,
I would stay in Oxford.
They gave me a first.
I drove Stephen and his young brother at Woburn Park.
And he climbed a tree; he was testing himself out, I think, I didn't realize.
And he did manage to climb the tree, and to go along a branch of it and to get himself down.
I think he began to notice that his hands were less useful than they had been, but he didn't tell us.
Uni has this square staircases which are round but they're square.
He was just coming down from one of the rooms
Steve actually fell on the stairs coming down the stairs and, he kind of bounced all the way down to the bottom.
I don't know if he loss consciousness, but he lost his memory.
We took him to either my room or someone's room.
The first question of course was:
"Who am I?"
and we told him: "You're Steve Hawking."
and a minute later or right away
He would ask: "Who am I?"
"Erh..
Steve Hawking."
And then after a couple of minutes he remembered he was Steve Hawking.
and we tell him: "Do you remember going down to the bar and having a drink"
"on Sunday night?"
Or: "Do you remember rowing, coxing on the river on Monday?"
And his memory came back gradually, until he could remember the previous days events and then the previous hour.
By the end of the 2 hours he could remember everything.
The question was:
"Well maybe, you know, you've lost some of your mind because of this"
And so, Steve decided: "Well, I'll take the Mensa test."
We said: "Of course you'll get into Mensa."
But he came back delighted that he was able to get into Mensa, absolutely delighted.
I felt that there were 2 areas of Theoretical Physics
I might study at Cambridge
One was Cosmology, the study of the very large.
the other was Elementary Particles, the study of the very small.
However, I thought that elementary particles were less attractive because there was no proper theory.
All they could do was arrange the particles in families, like in botany.
In Cosmology, on the other hand, there was a well defined theory:
Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.
It was very a very cold year and the ice on Veralamian pond was, it was all frozen then.
And we all went skating.
And Stephen managed to skate fairly well.
But then, he and I were closed together, he wasn't skating in a very advanced way, but nor was I as it comes to, and he fell and he couldn't get up.
So I took him to café to warm up and he told me then all about it
and it was diagnosed.
I've insisted on going to see his doctor because, it seemed to me, however long you're going to live there's probably something someone can do about it.
at least anyhow to make things easier for people.
And, I won't mention the doctor's name, but I got to see him at the London Clinic.
And he was rather surprised that I should bother to come down to see him.
I mean after all I was only Stephen's mother!
He was quite nice, I mean, he agreed to see me in a rather grand way.
And he said: "Yes, it's all very sad, I mean, a brilliant young man, cut off in the prime of his."
But of course I said:
"What can we do?"
"What can we do to, sort of...
Can we give him... can we get physiotherapy?"
"Can we get anything like that that will help in any way?"
He said: "Well, actually no,"
"there's nothing to it", more or less.
That's it.
Shortly after my 21st birthday,
I went into hospital for tests.
They took a muscle sample from my arm, stuck electrodes into me, and injected some radio-opaque fluid into my spine and watched it going up and down with X-rays as they tilted the bed.
I was diagnosed as having ALS
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis... or motor-neuron disease, as it is also known.
The doctors offered no cure and gave me 2 and a half years to live.
I went into the graduates common room and looking really for someone to have lunch with and there was nobody around that I particularly wished to have lunch with and then learned about how Stephen walk through the door.
Don't know what he was doing in Oxford either, I've certainly forgotten that.
And so...
Stephen generously went off to buy the drinks and brought them over, put them down on the table, and as he put his pint of beer down, he spewed it.
And I sort of said, genially:
"Ah, haven't you been drinking at this time of day?"
and he then told me that he'd been in Edinburgh for 3 weeks and they'd done a whole series of tests and they decided what was wrong with him.
And he told me very straight and flat that he was gradually going to lose the use of all of his body.
And that eventually only his heart and his lungs would still be operating, and his brain.
And that they told him that, eventually, he would essentially have the body of a cabbage.
but his mind would still be in perfect working order, and he would be unable to communicate with the rest of the world.
My dreams at that time were rather disturbed.
Before my condition had been diagnosed,
I had been very bored with life.
There had not seemed to be anything worth doing.
But shortly after I came out of hospital,
I dreamt that I was going to be executed.
I suddenly realized that there were lots of worthwhile things
I could do if I were retrieved.
I knew perfectly well that he had no faith.
And to me that made it more difficult, because you must ask yourself:
"Why me?
Why this?"
"Why now?"
But he just totally, flatly, accepted that this was what was going to happen to him.
And as far as I can gather at that point he started to do some work.
At first, there di not seem to be much time in working at my research, because I didn't expect to live long enough to finish my Ph.D.
However, as time went by, the disease seemed to slow down.
I began to understand General Relativity and make progress with my work.
But what really made a difference was
I got engaged to a girl called Jane Wilde.
This gave me something to live for, but it also meant that I had to get a job if we were to get married.
Stephen was already ill, Jane knew it.
And it was another instance of Stephen's luck.
Meeting the right person at the right time, because Jane...
Stephen was very very badly depressed.
And... he wasn't really very much inclined to go on with his work, I mean, you're told you got 2 and a half years, what can you do in that time?
But meeting Jane, really put him on his metal,
And he started to work.
I wanted to understand how the Universe began.
Einstein's theory of General Relativity showed that the Universe was expanding.
But there was no answer to the crucial question:
"Must there have been a Big Bang?"
"A beginning to time?"
Then, in my 3rd year at Cambridge
Roger Penrose made his discovery about the death of stars.
I remember talking to this friend, Ivor Robinson, and we were having some very animated conversation.
and then we had to cross the road, and as we crossed the road of course the conversation stopped, and then we got to the other side, well evidently I had some idea in crossing the road but then the conversation started up
and it got completely blotted out of my mind.
And it was only later, after my friends had gone home.
and I began having this strange feeling of [?
]elation, it feeling wonderful.
And I couldn't figure out why on earth I should feel like that, so I went back over the day, thinking all possible things which might have contributed to such a feeling, and then gradually I unearthed
this thought which I had while crossing the street.
Penrose announced this result, that when stars collapse indefinitely they will become singular as long as certain very broad conditions are satisfied that every body would have regarded as reasonable.
and I remember Stephen Hawking, who was then approaching his 3rd year as a research student, saying:
"What, very interesting results,"
"I wonder wether they could be adapted"
"to understand the origin of the Universe."
and what he had in mind, you see, was that if, just mentally, you reverse the sense of time, you can think of the expanding universe as a collapsing system, it's a bit like a giant, a very giant star collapsing
Roger Penrose proved that a dying star collapsing under its own gravity eventually shrinks to a singularity, a point of infinite density and zero size.
I realized that if I reversed the direction of time, so that the collapse become an expansion,
I could prove that the Universe had a beginning.
But my proof, based on Einstein's theory of General Relativity, also showed that we cannot understand how the universe began, because it showed that all scientific theories, including General Relativity itself, break down at the beginning of the Universe.
We had this meeting at the Institute of Space Physics in New York.
I said: "Before we reach a final conclusion,"
"we ought to throw into the pot"
"still another object:"
"a gravitationally completely collapsed object."
Well, after you've used the phrase:
"a gravitationally completely collapsed object"
ten times, you conclude you've get to get a better name, so that's when I switched to the word 'black hole'.
The word 'black hole', which John Miller coined, suddenly caught on.
Everybody adopted it and from then on people around the world, in Moscow,
in America, in England and elsewhere, could know they were speaking about the same thing.
And not only that, but suddenly the hole range of concept's got through to the general public, and even science fiction writers all of a sudden could talk about it.
Tonight, my friends,
We stand on the break of a feat unparalleled in space exploration.
If the data in my returning probe ship matches my computerized calculations,
I will travel where no man has dared to go.
Into the black hole?
In...
Through...
And behind!
Why that's crazy!
Ah!
Impossible!
As a massive star contracts, its gravity becomes so strong that light can no longer escape.
The region from which nothing can escape is called a 'black hole' and its boundary is called the 'event horizon'.
One might say of the event horizon what Dante said of the entrance to Hell:
"Abandon all hope ye who enter here."
I was once asked to actually be an adjudicator on an essay of which the subject was:
"How to fall into a black hole and live"
Now, the problem I had was that I wouldn't know how to give out the prize, because if I said: "Well, that looks like a really good essay", the only real way of showing that this was right
was to actually follow it, to do the experiment of fall in, but then having fallen in, also I would assume taking the person who wrote the essay with you, the question would be:
"How do you tell the rest of the world?"
Do you take the prize in with you that you'd give to him, and what do they do with it when do when get to the center?
Believe me
I've been waiting a long time for someone like you to record this moment.
Thank you, doctor.
Then, I'm ready.
Ready to embark on man's greatest journey.
Certainly his riskiest.
The risk is incidental compared to the possibility to possess the great truth of the unknown.
There, long cherished laws of nature simply do not apply.
They vanish.
And life?
Life?
Life forever.
If you were watching an astronaut fool hardly enough to jump into a black hole, at some time on his watch, say 12 o'clock, he will cross the event horizon and enter the black hole.
But no matter how long you waited, you would never see the astronaut's watch reach 12 o'clock.
Instead, each second on the watch would appear to take longer and longer until the last second before midnight would take forever.
Thus, by jumping into a black hole, one could ensure that one's image lasted forever.
But the picture would fade very rapidly and grow so dim that no one could see it.
When somebody disappears into the black hole as seen from the outside, you...
it looks like time actually slows down.
and the person becomes... who's moving or at least he thinks he's moving and talking in his spaceship at a normal rate, seems to slow down and ends up by being frozen in a particular position as seen from somebody watching from the outside,
and as seen from the outside you never see what happens after that.
The astronaut wouldn't notice anything special when his watch reached midnight and he crossed the event horizon into the black hole.
Until of course he approached the singularity and was crushed into spaghetti.
One can fall though this event horizon without feeling anything, without noticing it.
After about a week of falling, one begins to feel a pinch, and one extends longer and longer and gets slightly thinner and of course one begins to get squeezed, until one gets very long and very thin
and rather nasty.
By the end of two weeks one's fallen right into the center and one is of course dead.
Before you lose sight of the outer world, you would see things happening and you would see them at a greater rate so that it would look like a firework display.
And the frustration would be that, although you would be able to see everything that happens in the future, it would be going so fast from the scientific point of view, you would have no time to analyze it,
you wouldn't be able to take it in.
And eventually things would be going so fast and it would be so explosive that you yourself would be destroyed by the explosion and that would be the end.
But it would be a very exciting way to end one's life.
It would be the way I would choose if I had the choice.
In the long history of the Universe, many stars must have burned up their nuclear fuel and collapsed in on themselves.
The number of black holes may be greater than the number of visible stars, which totals about a hundred thousand million in our galaxy alone.
We also have evidence that there is a very large black hole at the centre of our own galaxy.
Friends ask me:
"Well, if a black hole is black, how can you see it?"
And I say: "Have you have you ever been to a ball?"
"Have you ever watched the young man dressed in their black evening tuxedos"
"and the girls in their white dresses, whirling around, held in each other's arms?"
"And the lights turn low, and all you can see is the girls."
Well, the girl is the ordinary star and the boy is the black hole.
You can't see the black hole any more that you can see the boy, but the girl going around gives you convincing evidence there must be something there, holding her in orbit.
One evening, shortly after the birth of my daughter, Lucy,
I started thinking about black holes as I was getting into bed.
My disability made this a rather slow process, so I had plenty of time.
Suddenly, I realized that the area of the event horizon must always increase with time.
The increase in the area of the event horizon was reminiscent of a quantity called entropy, which measures the degree of disorder of a system.
It is a matter of common experience that disorder tends to increase with time if things are left at themselves.
Jacob Bekenstein came in at the office one day.
"Jakob," I said, "it always troubles me:"
"when I put a hot tea cup next to a cold tea cup, I've increased,"
"by letting heat flow from one to the other,"
"the amount of disorder in the Universe."
"But Jakob, if a black hole swirls by,"
"and I drop both tea cups into this,"
"I can seal the evidence of my crime, have I not?"
Bekenstein's a man of great integrity and he looked troubled, and he came back to me later and he said: "No, you have not concealed the evidence of your crime."
"The black hole records what's happened to you."
Stephen Hawking read the paper in which Bekenstein announced his result and thought it was preposterous and he decided to prove that he was wrong.
My discoveries led Jacob Bekenstein to suggest that the area of the event horizon actually was the entropy of the black hole.
But there was one fatal flaw in Bekenstein's idea:
if black holes have an entropy, they ought to have a temperature.
And if they have a temperature, they ought to give off radiation.
But how could they give off radiation if nothing can escape from a black hole?
As it turned out, Bekenstein was basically correct, thought in a manner far more surprising than he, or anyone else, had expected.
As he gradually lost the use of his hands, he had to start developing... carefully choosing research projects that could be tackled and solved through geometrical arguments that he could do pictorially in his head.
and he developed a very powerful set of tools that nobody else really had so in some sense, when you lose one set of tools you may develop other tools, but to get new tools on a minimal to different kind of problems in your tools
and if you're the only master in the world of this new tools, that means certain kinds of problems you can solve and nobody else can.
My work up to 1973 was in General Relativity and was summarized in a book which I wrote with George Ellis called "The large scale structure of space-time".
Even then, it was difficult for me to write things down.
So I tended to think in pictures and diagrams that I could visualize in my head.
I remember visiting Stephen and Jane at their home in Cambridge.
After supper in the evening when it was time for Stephen to go to bed
Jane insisted and Stephen acquiesced,
I guess this was standard, that Stephen make his way up.
I forgot whether there's one flight of stairs or two flight of stairs, alone and this was at a period that he can no longer walk.
the way he got up the stairs was he grabbed hold of the pillars that support the banister and pulled him up with the strength of his own, pulled himself up the stairs by the strength of his own arms,
dragging himself up from the ground floor up to the second storey in a long, arduous effort.
Jane explained that this was an important part of his physical therapy to maintain his coordination and strength as long as possible.
at first, it was sort of hard renting[?
] to watch what appeared to be the agony of pulling up the stairs until I understood it was just part of life pulling himself up the stairs like that.
General Relativity is what is called a classical theory.
It predicts a single definite path for each particle.
But according to quantum mechanics, there is an element of chance or uncertainty.
A particle does not have just a single path through space and time.
Instead, there is an uncertainty principle according to which both the exact position and velocity of the particle can never be known.
I began investigating the effect of quantum mechanics might have on particles near a black hole.
I found that particles could escape from a black hole, that black holes are not completely black.
At first, I didn't believe it.
But when I redid the calculations, I couldn't get the effect to go away.
I met martin Reese and he was shaking with excitement.
And he said: "Have you heard, have you heard!"
"What Stephen has discovered?
Everything is different!
everything is changed!"
I was still unsure of my discovery so I only told a few colleagues.
But word soon spread.
Roger Penrose phoned up on my birthday.
He was very excited and went on so long that my birthday dinner got quite cold.
It was a great pity because it was goose, which I'm very fond of.
To me it's a miracle, because it's a complicated and messy calculation.
we can now do these things very much better and it's more transparent what happens.
But out of this messy calculation, he showed that black holes aren't black.
With this quanto-mechanical effect which was a residual radiation.
Stephen came to a meeting and people were flabbergasted.
I remember someone getting up and saying:
"You must be wrong Stephen."
"I don't believe a word of it!"
I once said that I was unhappy with the explanation given in terms of negative energy particles being created.
But I feel this is part of the controversy of science.
You must have the give and take.
And I'm delighted to be able to be part of that.
I mean, it's what makes it fun.
You know, if you all sat down and said: "Oh, lovely!"
when you do have niggling questions in your mind that's not doing a good service to science.
But I was not antagonistic to it in any way, except for that one time when I questioned.
I finally convinced myself that black holes radiated when I found a mechanism through which this could happen.
According to quantum mechanics, space is filled with virtual particles and anti-particles that are constantly materializing in pairs, separating, coming together again and annihilating each other.
In the presence of a black hole, one member of a pair of virtual particles may fall into the hole, leaving the other member without a partner with which to annihilate.
The forsaken particle appears to be radiation emitted bu the black hole.
And so, black holes are not eternal.
They evaporate away at an increasing rate until they vanish in a gigantic explosion.
Quantum mechanics has allowed particles and radiation to escape from the ultimate prison:
a black hole.
Einstein never accepted quantum mechanics because of its element of chance and uncertainty.
He said:
"God does not play dice".
It seems that Einstein was doubly wrong.
The quantum effects of black holes suggests that not only does God play dice, he sometimes throw them where they cannot be seen.
He says himself that he wouldn't have got where he is if he hadn't been ill.
And I think that's quite possible, because it's like Johnson said, you know:
"Knowledge to be hanged in the morning concentrates the mind wonderfully".
And he has concentrated on this in a way that I don't think he would have done because he always took a great interest in a lot of things in life and I don't know if he would have applied himself in quite the same way
if he'd been able to get around as is.
So in a way...
No, I can't think anyone's lucky of having an illness like that, even still, but it's bad less luck for him that it would be for some people, if you see what I mean,
because he can so much live in his head.
When I lived with the Hawking family I would usually get up around 7h15 or 7h30, and take a shower and then read my bible some in the morning and pray.
And then I would go down at 8h15 to get Stephen up.
And then at breakfast I would often tell him what I'd been reading in the bible hoping that, you know, maybe this would eventually have some influence.
So then we would get into work and usually we'd go and see if there were any scientific papers that people sent out and.
I did discover that despite Hawking's great brains he reads quite slowly.
I mean, I can read about twice as fast as him.
But of course, the point is he would have to read to memory because it would be very difficult for him to go back and access the thing.
Whereas I can skim the paper rather quickly and see if there was anything interesting in it and if I wanted to work on it
I can pick the thing up and look at it.
Black hole radiation has shown us that gravitational collapse is not as final as we once thought.
If an astronaut falls into a black hole, he will be returned to the rest of the Universe in the form of radiation.
Thus, in a sense, the astronaut will be recycled.
However, it would be a poor sort of immortality because any personal concept of time would come to an end as he is torn apart inside a black hole.
All that would survive would be his mass, or energy.
One year the Hawkings took me along when we went to a cottage in Wales near the river Wye.
And this cottage was up a hill and there was a bit of a paved, well, sidewalk that went up to the cottage which I had not been up.
And of course I wanted to do it in the least number of trips that I could imagine, so we put Stephen's batteries under his chair, I mean his wheelchair has space for batteries, and put extra batteries under there, which we...
Stephen didn't realize he had...
that I put under there, he didn't realize his chair was as heavily laden as possible.
So Stephen was quite a bit ahead of me and then he was turning the corner to go on to... around to his house, but that was on a slope and...
So I looked up and I noticed
Stephen's wheelchair was slowly tipping backward.
And of course that was about 10 meters away.
I tried to roll up there but of course I wasn't able to get there nearly rapidly enough before he toppled over backward into the bushes.
And this was a bit of a shocking sight, to see this master of gravity getting overcome by the weak gravitational force of Earth!
One of the worst things for me would be having people there all the time, never alone I reckon, really.
And yet he finds things funny and he enjoys life and he goes dashing about all over the place.
And I think this is tremendous, that this is the sort of courage I haven't got, that his father hadn't got.
And we cannot but admire it, but I wonder how on earth he got it, really!
There must have been 50 people there and I was standing off in a corner, sort of, watching quietly for a few minutes, relaxing.
And Stephen was not far from me.
Jane walked over to Stephen and looked at him and he was sitting with his head on his lap, like only Stephen can put his head in his lap, and Jane said to Stephen:
"You look miserable Stephen!"
Sit up straight!"
"Some of your guests don't understand"
"that you're sitting there thinking about physics and having a wonderful time,"
"it looks like you're in pain.
Sit up straight and go talk to your guests."
In 1979, I was elected Lucasian Professor of Mathematics.
This is the same chair once held by Isaac Newton.
They a have a big book which every university teaching officer is supposed to sign.
After I had been Lucasian Professor for about a year they realized I had never signed.
So they brought the book to my office and I signed it with some difficulty.
That was the last time I signed my name.
My interest in the origin and fate of the Universe was reawakened when I attended a conference on cosmology in the Vatican.
Afterwards, we were granted an audience with the pope.
He told us that it was all right to study the evolution of the Universe after the Big Bang,
but we should not inquire into the Big Bang itself, because that was the moment of creation, and therefore, the work of God.
I was glad that he did not know the subject of the talk I had just given:
the possibility that the Universe had no beginning, no moment of creation.
There were theories in the early 70s, in fact the first type of creation theories, where the people concerned started off with a fixed external space and time which for eternity was empty.
Then suddenly, for some unknown reason, Universe nucleates in a point and then Bang!
It blows apart.
But the trouble is that when the space and time appear in the classical theory the actual point itself is a singular point in the mathematics.
Mathematics breaks down, and so you cannot in fact use that to give you a creation theory.
If one goes back in time, one comes to the Big Bang singularity, where then laws of Physics break down.
But there's another direction of time that one can go in, which avoids the singularity.
This is called the imaginary direction of time.
In imaginary time, there need not be any singularities which form a beginning or end to time.
When you come to imaginary time, you have this rather peculiar possibility of having a 'now', as it were, not necessarily having a sort of a chain of past moments.
If we start to lay out the moments that run in backwards in time, as it were, then for a long time things work perfectly normally.
But then as you begin to get further and further back towards what would be the origin point in a conventional real time picture you'd find that the nature of time changes, that the imaginary component becomes more and more prominent,
and in the end, what ought be a singular point in the classical theory just gets smoothed away and you have this beautiful picture, this bowls, where the creation of the Universe is pictured, as where we are now
in a smooth sort of bowl past where there's no initial point, just a sort of smooth shape.
So long as the Universe had a beginning, we could suppose it had a Creator.
But if the Universe is completely self-contained, having no boundary or edge,
it would neither be created nor destroyed, it would simply be.
What place then, for a Creator?
What we can really say is that the Universe is, because it is a self-consistent mathematical structure.
There's no past because, unlike the creation point scenario there's nothing for it to
So to say it's created from nothing is actually a bit of a misnomer, it's a misleading use of the word 'nothing'.
It's not just that there was empty space in which the Universe appeared, which you might call 'nothing', there was really nothing at all because there wasn't even a creation event, you see.
The use of past tense in a verb becomes inappropriate in these theories.
Unfortunately, tenses were set up when people believed in real time, of course, and we don't yet have a linguistic form to describe tenses in imaginary time.
The word 'time' was not handed down from Heaven, as a gift from On High.
The idea of 'time' is a word invented by man, and if it has puzzlements connected with it, whose fault is it?
It's our fault!
Where does the difference between the past and the future come from?
The laws of science do not distinguish between the past and the future.
Yet, there is a big difference between the past and future in ordinary life.
You may see a cup of tea fall off a table and break into peaces on the floor, but you will never see a cup gather together and jump back on the table.
The increase of disorder or entropy is what distinguishes the past from the future, giving the direction to time.
He fell ill in Switzerland.
When he came back, he was on a ventilator.
Because he was on a ventilator, you've got a tube down you throat, and therefore you can't speak, just for that reason.
For that period, which might have been a couple of months,
I spent probably one in two nights, one in three nights, at the hospital, because when he was in hospital he couldn't communicate with the nurses.
And it's not just like being seriously ill, but you're in a position where the nurses couldn't understand what Stephen wanted.
If Stephen was uncomfortable, they couldn't tell why.
Before I caught pneumonia, my speech had been getting more slurred so that only a few people who knew me well could understand me.
But at least I could communicate.
I wrote scientific papers by dictating to a secretary and I gave seminars through an interpreter.
And then, a tracheotomy operation removed my ability to speak altogether.
After a long time, well it seemed like along time, somebody came up with this brilliant gadget.
They didn't have it in Cambridge Hospital, they got it from somewhere in London.
This was high technology: how you can communicate with a person with no voice?
It's a plastic piece of Perspex, about so big, and you've got the letters of the alphabet arranged like that and a hole in the middle.
You hold it up between you and the other person and they look at a letter, and you can see of course which letter they're looking at, most of the time, sometimes you can't quite be sure,
and so you get the patient to spell out what they wanted, you know, so each letter you have to look:
speak out the A, and you say: "A?" You get it right.
It's like a guessing game.
Stephen wasn't going to accept that he wasn't going to speak again and he thought that he would be giving in by trying to find a method of communicating without speech.
And I remember I went to him one evening, and this was the first time that he asked to be gotten out of bed to use a computer.
Sometimes, they were sitting him up so that he wasn't lying in the bed all the time, as you do with a patient, but this time, when I turned up, he asked the nurse could he be gotten out of bed
so he could use the computer, and he did.
I remember the first thing he typed in there, after saying 'hello',
-Stephen's always being very polite about things like that- was: "Will you help me finish my book?"
A computer expert in California heard of my plight and sent me a computer program called Equalizer.
This allowed me to select words from a series of menus on a screen by pressing a switch in my hand.
These words could then be sent to a speech synthesizer attached to my wheelchair.
Much to my surprise,
I found I was able to communicate much better than before.
When eventually he went home from hospital, and he was told he needed 24 hour nursing, and everyone was saying:
"Well, how is he gonna go in and do work."
"Is he going to trail around with a series of nurses after him working in the office?"
And of course he did!
I mean, they talked originally of him working at home, which he wasn't happy with.
And so after a period of recuperation home he just decided to go back into the office, and he made the trip from his house to the office which is, I don't know, half a mile, in his wheelchair,
And the nurses were walking along with him.
And this is at the time when he was still driving around with a bag and a nasal drip[?
].
Going into the department, working, going back home.
I began to wonder what would happen when the Universe stopped expanding and began to contract.
Would we see broken cups gather themselves together off the floor and jump back on to the table?
Would we be able to remember tomorrow's prices and make a fortune off the stock market?
It seemed to me the Universe had to return to a smooth and ordered state when it re-collapsed.
If this were so, time would go backwards when the Universe began to collapse.
People in the contracting phase would live their lives backwards, they would die before they were born and get younger as the Universe got small again.
Eventually, they would return to the womb.
He gave me my first problem to do.
He asked me to look at this mathematical problem and usually, when he gives a problem, he has a good idea of what the answer should be.
And I went to look at it and it took me a few months to understand what was it about and I came back and I said:
"Stephen I get this answer."
And he said to me: "No, that is not what I expected."
I said: "Stephen that's what I get."
And so I went to the blackboard, explained to him what it was.
He said: "Did you think about that particular case?"
I said: "Oh no I didn't!"
So I went back
I calculated what he talked to me about, came back a few weeks after and I said:
"Stephen, I don't get this thing."
"I still get the same answer I had originally."
So he said to me:
"No no no, this is not right,"
"did you think about that?" "Oh no!"
"I'd forgotten about that particular case."
So I went back to the drawing board, started calculating again.
And again, get the same answer!
I went back to see Stephen, and this dragged on for about 2 or 3 months.
Finally he said to me: "Maybe,"
"one of you approximations isn't valid."
So me and a colleague decided to do this thing with computers, and than this takes a lot of time to write the programs and to be sure the program was correct...
We get the answer and it was still the way that I said before and not the way that Stephen has said, so we went to see Stephen and we said: "You see?
Again!"
I had make a mistake.
I had been using too simple a model of the Universe.
Time will not reverse direction when the Universe begins to contract.
People will continue to get older, so it is no good waiting until the universe re-collapses to return to our youth.
Einstein once asked a question:
"How much choice did God have in constructing the Universe?"
If my proposal that the universe has no boundary is correct, he had no freedom at all to choose how the Universe began.
He would only had had a freedom to choose the laws the Universe obeyed.
This, however, may not have been all that much of a choice.
They may be well be only one unified theory that allows for the existence of structures as complicated as human beings, who can investigate the laws of the Universe and ask about the nature of God.
I don't know how clear-cut these experiments are, but the experiments that have been done on, sort of, the timing of consciousness, and they seem to lead to a very odd picture which doesn't even quite make consistent sense.
Whether refinement of these experiments might actually get rid of this kind of anomaly, I'm not sure, but it does look a little as though there's something very odd about consciousness, and somehow almost as though future affects the past in some way
over a very tiny limited scale but something maybe of the order of a reasonable fraction of a second.
And there's no reason to believe that one's conscious experience shouldn't be part of somebody else's at some other stage, I mean.
I don't if it's fair to say what happens after one dies but you could... it's a plausible picture that you could be somebody else.
And that somebody else could be somebody who lived in the past, not in the future.
If there's only one possible unified theory that is just a set of rules and equations,
what is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a Universe for them to describe?
Why does the Universe go to all the bother of existing?
Is the unified theory so compelling that it brings about its own existence?
Or does it need a Creator?
And if so, who created Him?
I think I would say that the Universe has a purpose, it's not somehow just there by chance,
I mean, I think it's...
Some people, I think, take the view that the Universe is just there and it sort of rumbles along and it just sort of computes, we happen somehow by accident and found ourselves in this thing.
But I don't think that's a very fruitful or helpful way of looking at the Universe.
I think that there's something much deeper about it.
In real time, the time in which we live, the Universe has two possible destinies:
it may continue to expand forever, or it may re-collapse and come to an end at a Big Crunch.
It would be rather like the big Bang, but in reverse.
I now believe that the Universe will come to an end at a Big Crunch.
I do, however, have certain advantages over many other prophets of doom:
whatever happens 10 billion years from now,
I don't expect to be around to be proved wrong.
Of all the pictures that I know, the simplest of any cosmology is that in which the Universe is closed, has a finite lifetime, and collapses with the same kind of collapse that a black hole does.
If it should turn out that indeed the Universe is limited in its life, how is that different from the life of each one of us?
On the evening of Tuesday, March 5th, at about 10h45,
I was returning to my flat in Pinehurst.
It was dark and raining.
I came up to Grange Road and saw headlights approaching, but judged that they were far enough away that I could cross safely.
The vehicle must have been travelling very fast, for when I got just past the middle of the road, my nurse screamed:
"Look out!"
I heard tires skidding and my wheelchair was struck a tremendous blow in the back.
I ended up in the road, with my legs over the remains of the wheelchair.
The accident destroyed my wheelchair and damaged my computer system with which I communicate.
I required 13 stitches in my head, but I was able to go back to work several days later.
The memories I have are very much, kind of, visual pictures of what Stephen was.
I've seen Stephen in certain situations.
He was always moving, always.
He was hardly ever still.
It was the same thing about his face and gestures, which he used a great deal, I should say.
But it's only memory.
I found some photographs recently which reminded me of the general look of everybody.
I must say Stephen looked very much as he does now.
If one thinks of him like that.
He does believe very intensely in almost infinite possibility of the human mind.
You have to find out what you can't know before you know you can't, don't you?
So I don't think that thought should be restricted at all, and there's... why shouldn't you go on thinking about the unthinkable?
Somebody's got to start sometime.
I mean, think how many things were unthinkable a century ago.
And yet people have thought them.
And often they seemed quite impractical.
Not all things Stephen says probably are to be taken as Gospel.
truth is, he's a searcher, he's looking for things and if he is sometimes, he probably talks nonsense as we all... but the point is:
people must think.
People must go on thinking.
They must try to extend the boundaries of knowledge, and they don't sometimes even know where to start.
We don't know where the boundaries are, do we?
We don't know what the taking off point is.
If we do discover a complete theory of the Universe, it should, in time, be understandable, in broad principle, by everyone, not just a few scientists.
Then we shall all, philosophers, scientists and just ordinary people, be able to take part in the discussion on why it is that we, and the Universe, exist.
If we find the answer to that, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason.
For then we would know the mind of God.
A BRIEF HISTORY OF TIME
Which came first?
The chicken or the egg?
Did the Universe have a beginning?
And if so, what happened before then?
Where does the Universe come from?
And where is it going?
Luck.
Luck, well
We have been very lucky.
I mean, my family, and Stephen, everybody
We had a few disasters, but the point is that we have survived
Everybody has disasters, and yet some people disappear and they're never seen again.
Flybombs were very alarming
Seeking, buzzing over, and then they would cut out.
And when you heard the bang, you knew it wasn't you, so you went back to your meal, or whatever.
But one did fall quite close to our house.
and it blew the back windows out so the glass was sticking dagger points out of the opposite wall.
When Stephen was born, we decided he'd better be born in Oxford.
So while I was staying in the hospital.
I went to Blackwells, in Oxford, and I bought an astronomical atlas.
One of my sisters-in-law said:
"This is a very prophetic thing for you to have done."
How real is time?
Will it ever come to an end?
Where does the difference between the past and the future come from?
Why do we remember the past but not the future?
I can remember that day when we travelled through London and the black-out was over.
And the trains, instead of being shut in by blinds, so you just travelled in a train.
We were coming over one of the bridges and all lights, well, such lights as were left were only in London.
but it was also a completely starry night
You could see the might whole against it.
I remember we all used to lie on the grass, looking staight up through a telescope and seeing the wonders of the stars.
Stephen always had a strong sense of wonder and I could see that the stars would draw him, and further than the stars.
I was born exactly 300 years after the death of Galileo.
I estimate that about 200 000 other babies were also born that day.
I don't know whether any of them was later interested in astronomy.
My first memory is about pushing a rather antiquated carriage built pram along North Road, with Stephen and Mary in it, sort of looking very large, because they had large heads and pink cheeks, and they were very noticeable.
They all looked diffrent from ordinary people.
I can remember visiting the Hawking home several times.
It was the sort of place where, if you were invited to stay to supper, you might be allowed to have your conversation with Stephen... but the rest of the family would be sitting at the table reading a book.
A behaviour which is not really approved of bymy circle, but which is tolereated from the Hawkings because they were recognised to be very excentric, highly intelligent, very clever people, but still... a bit... odd.
My impression of the Hawking family was that they were all like that, except for Stephen, who seemed to be the only normal member of the family.
Stephen used to reckon he knew, I think it was, 11 ways of getting into the house.
But I could only find 10 of them.
I'm not sure what the other way was.
On the north side of the house was a bicycle shack had a door at the front and a door at the back.
Above that, there was a window into the L-shaped room.
And at the front you could get sort of round corner onto the roof
And from that level you could get onto the main roof.
I think one of the ways that Stephen could get in was on the main roof.
I must say he was a much better climber than I was.
I still don't know what the 11th one was!
Before the 20th century, it was thought that the Universe had existed forever, or had been created at some time in the past more or less as we observe it today.
People found comfort in the thought that even though they may grow older and die, the Universe was eternal and unchanging.
I gave up playing games with Stephen when he was ill that time about...
when he was about 12.
Becouse he started taking games terribly seriously.
We had Monopoly.
And... first of all the Monoply board sprang railways going across it... tried to add complications.
And then Monopoly just wasn't adaptable enough.
But he ended up with a fearful game called 'Dynasty' which, as far as I can make out, for I say, I never played it, went on forever, because there was no way of ending it!
It was almost a substitute for living as far as I could make out,
It took hours, and hours, and hours.
I thought it was a perfectly terrible game.
I couldn't imagine anyone getting taken up with that.
But Stephen always had a very complicated mind, and I felt as much as anything it was the complication of it that appealed to him.
When I was in high school,
I learned that light from distant galaxies was shifted at the red.
This meant that they were moving away from us and that the Universe was expanding.
But I didn't believe it.
A static Universe seemed much more natural.
It could have existed, and could continue to exist forever.
We were discussing the possibility of the spontaneous generation of life, and I think that Stephen made a remark which indicated not only that he thought of this, but he did even also come across some calculations as to how long it might take.
At that time I think I made a comment to one of my friends, John McLennahan:
"I think that Stephen will turn out to be unusually capable."
I didn't say it in quite these words but I made one such remark to him and he disagreed.
And so we made a bet on the subject.
In a childish way we bet a bag of sweets on the issue.
And instantly I reckon that my bet has come correct and I think I'm entitled to payment which is not yet been made.
The expansion of the Universe suggested a possibility that the Universe had a beginning at some time in the past.
The point at which the Universe may have started out became known as the Big Bang.
The first year he was at St. Albans school, he came, I think, third from the bottom.
So I said: "Well, Stephen,
"do you really have to be as far down as that?"
And he said: "Well,"
"lot of other people didn't do much better."
He was quite unconcerned.
Somehow he was always recognized as being very bright and in fact they gave him the Divinity Prize one year.
That was not surprising as his father used to teach him Bible stories from very early age and he knew them all very well and he was quite well versed in religious things although
I don't think he makes a very great deal of practice of it now.
Everyone used to argue theology.
That's a good safe subject.
You don't need any fact, sort of, or distracting things like that.
If you're going for arguing, you know, debating, you can quite happily debate about anything... including... theology and the existence of, or otherwise, of God.
And then someone gets bored, or
Journey Into Space comes on or something like that the argument breaks up.
In an unhcnaging Universe, one can imagine that God created the Universe at literally any time in the past.
On the other hand, if the Universe is expanding there are maybe physical reasons why there had to be a beginning.
An expanding Universe does not preclude a creator... but it does place limits on when he might have carried out his job.
When the family went to India, it was arranged for Stephen to come and live with us for a year.
He decided it would be nice that we should have
Scottish dancing in the evening.
Now mind you, this was quite an ordinary house, but we had rather a lot of room and a large hall, and so we bought some records, and a book about what to do, and Stephen took charge.
And he insisted to put on a jacket and a tie.
And then he was the master of the proceedings.
And Stephen took it very seriously
But then he liked dancing, you see.
There were 4 physicists in my year.
Gordon Berry,
Richard Bryath,
Stephen myself.
I first remember Stephen on the occasion when Gordon and I went up after dinner to his room, to try to find him.
And Stephen was up there with a crate of beer, slowly drinking his way through it.
He was only 17, he couldn't legally go into a pub.
He did come at Oxford ridiculously early.
We used to have what we called a "gathering net".
We used to organize that at beer parties and various things like that to gather under this cover as many freshman as we could get, you see get them to join the boat club.
And that's how we collected him, you see.
But the question, always, with Stephen, was
"Should we make him the cox of the first 8,"
"or the second 8?", you see?
Well, coxes can be adventurous.
But some coxes can be very steady people, you see.
He was rather an adventurous type.
You never knew could what he was going to do when he went out with the crew.
I think he used to bring his work there with him into the boat sometimes
Some thinking here was going on...
Different levels.
We were asked to read a chapter, chapter 10 in a book about electricity and magntism by Bleaney Bleaney, an unlikely combination of a husband and wife team.
And at the end of that chapter there were 13 questions, all of them final honours questions.
I discovered very rapidly that I couldn't do any of them.
Richard and I worked together for the week, and we managed to do one and a half questions, which we felt very proud of.
Gordon refused all assistance and managed to do one all by himself.
Stephen, as always, hadn't even started.
But the next morning, he went up to his rooms at 9 o'clock, and we came back about 12, maybe five past 12, and down came Stephen, we were in the college gateway, the lodge,
"Ah, Hawking," I said, "how many have you managed to do then?"
"Well," he said:
"I've only had time to do the first 10."
I think at that point we realised that it's not just we weren't in the same street, we weren't on the same planet.
I once calculated that I did about 1,000 hours work in the 3 years I was at Oxford.
An average of one hour a day.
I'm not proud of this lack of work.
I'm just describing my attitude at the time.
An attitude that nothing was worth making an effort for.
He used to produce his work every week for tutorial and, as he never kept any notes, or papers or that sort of things, on leaving my room he would normally throw it in my wastepaper basket.
And when he was with other undergraduates at the tutorial and they saw this happen they were absolutely horrified, 'cause they thought he did this work in probably half an hour, if they could have done it in a year
they wouldn't have thrown it in the wastepaper basket, they would have put in a frame up on their walls.
Because of my lack of work,
I had planned to get through the final exam by doing problems in Theoretical Physics, and avoiding any questions that required factual knowledge.
I didn't do very well.
I was on the borderline between a first and a second class degree.
And I had to be interviewed to determine which I should get.
They asked me about my future plans.
I replied if they gave me a first, I would go to Cambridge;
if only got a second,
I would stay in Oxford.
They gave me a first.
I drove Stephen and his young brother at Woburn Park.
And he climbed a tree; he was testing himself out, I think, I didn't realize.
And he did manage to climb the tree, and to go along a branch of it and to get himself down.
I think he began to notice that his hands were less useful than they had been, but he didn't tell us.
Uni has this square staircases which are round but they're square.
He was just coming down from one of the rooms
Steve actually fell on the stairs coming down the stairs and, he kind of bounced all the way down to the bottom.
I don't know if he loss conciousness, but he lost his memory.
We took him to either my room or someone's room.
The first question of course was:
"Who am I?"
and we told him: "You're Steve Hawking."
and a minute later or right away
He would ask: "Who am I?"
"uh..
Steve Hawking."
And then after a couple of minutes he remembered he was Steve Hawking.
and we tell him: "Do you remember going down to the bar and having a drink"
"on Sunday night?"
Or: "Do you remember rowing, coxing on the river on Monday?"
And his memory came back gradually, until he could remember the previous days events and then the previous hour.
By the end of the 2 hours he could remember everything.
The question was: "Well maybe, you know, you lost some of your mind bacause of this"
And so, Steve decided: "Well, I'll take the Mensa test."
We said: "Of course you'll get into Mensa."
But he came back delighted that he was able to get into Mensa, absolutely delighted.
I felt that there were 2 areas of Theoretical Physics
I might study at Cambridge
One was Cosmology, the study of the very large.
the other was Elementary Particles, the study of the very small.
However, I thought that elementary particles were less attractive because there was no proper theory.
All they could do was arrange the particles in families, like in botany.
In Cosmology, on the other hand, there was a well defined theory:
Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.
It was very a very cold year and the ice on Veralamian pond was, it was all frozen then.
and we all went skating.
And Stephen managed to skate fairly well.
But then, he and I were close together, he wasn't skating in a very advanced way, but nor was I as it comes to, and he fell and he couldn't get up.
So I took him to cafe to warm up and he told me then all about it
and it was diagnosed.
I'd insisted on going to see his doctor because, it seemed to me, however long you're going to live there's probably something someone can do about it.
at least anyhow to make things easier for people.
And, I won't mention the doctor's name, but I got to see him at the London Clinic.
And he was rather surprised that I should bother to come down to see him.
I mean afer all I was only Stephen's mother!
He was quite nice, I mean, he agreed to see me in a rather grand way.
And he said: "Yes, it's all very sad, I mean, a brilliant young man, cut off in the prime of his."
But of course I said:
"What can we do?"
"What can we do to, sort of...
Can we give him... can we get physiotherapy?"
"Can we get anything like that that will help in any way?"
He said: "Well, actually no,"
"there's nothing to it", more or less.
That's it.
Shortly after my 21st birthday,
I went into hospital for tests.
They took a muscle sample from my arm, stuck electrodes into me, and injected some radio-opaque fluid into my spine and watched it going up and down with X-rays as they tilted the bed.
I was diagnosed as having ALS
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis... or motor-neuron disease, as it is also known.
The doctors offered no cure and gave me 2 and a half years to live.
I went into the graduates common room and looking really for someone to have lunch with and there was nobody around that I particularly wished to have lunch with and then lo and behold Stephen walked through the door.
don't know what he was doing in Oxford either, I've certainly forgotten that.
And so...
Stephen generously went off to buy the drinks and brought them over, put them down on the table, and as he put his pint of beer down, he spilleed it.
And I sort of said, genially:
"Ah, you haven't been drinking at this time of day?"
and he then told me that he'd been in Edinburgh for 3 weeks and they'd done a whole series of tests and they decided what was wrong with him.
And he told me very straight and flat that he was gradually going to lose the use of all of his body.
And that eventually only his heart and his lungs would still be operating, and his brain.
And that they told him that, eventually, he would essentially have the body of a cabbage.
but his mind would still be in perfect working order, and he would be unable to communicate with the rest of the world.
My dreams at that time were rather disturbed.
Before my condition had been diagnosed,
I had been very bored with life.
There had not seemed to be anything worth doing.
But shortly after I came out of hospital,
I dreamt that I was going to be executed.
I suddenly realized that there were lots of worthwile things
I could do if I were reprieved.
I knew perfectly well that he had no faith.
And to me that made it more difficult, because you must ask yourself:
"Why me?
Why this?"
"Why now?"
But he just totally, flatly, accepted that this was what was going to happen to him.
And as far as I can gather at that point he started to do some work.
At first, there did not seem to be much point in working at my research, because I didn't expect to live long enough to finish my Ph.D.
However, as time went by, the disease seemed to slow down.
I began to understand General Relativity and make progress with my work.
But what really made a difference was
I got engaged to a girl called Jane Wilde.
This gave me something to live for, but it also meant that I had to get a job if we were to get married.
Stephen was already ill, Jane knew it.
And it was another instance of Stephen's luck.
Meeting the right person at the right time, because Jane...
Stephen was very very badly depressed.
And... he wasn't really very much inclined to go on with his work, I mean, you're told you got 2 and a half years, what can you do in that time?
But meeting Jane, really put him on his metal,
And he started to work.
I wanted to understand how the Universe began.
Einstein's theory of General Relativity showed that the Universe was expanding.
But there was no answer to the crucial question:
"Must there have been a Big Bang?"
"A beginning to time?"
Then, in my 3rd year at Cambridge
Roger Penrose made his discovery about the death of stars.
I remember talking to this friend, Ivor Robinson, and we were having some very animated conversation.
and then we had to cross the road, and as we crossed the road of course the conversation stopped, and then we got to the other side, well evidently I had some idea in crossing the road but then the conversation started up
and it got completely blotted out of my mind.
And it was only later, after my friends had gone home.
and I began having this strange feeling of elation, it feeling wonderful.
And I couldn't figure out why on earth I should feel like that, so I went back over the day, thinking all possible things which might have contributed to such a feeling, and then gradually I unearthed
this thought which I had while crossing the street.
Penrose announced this result, that when stars collapse indefinetly they will become singular as long as certain very broad conditions are satisfied that everybody would have regarded as reasonable.
and I remember Stephen Hawking, who was then approaching his 3rd year as a research student, saying:
"What, very interesting results,"
"I wonder whether they could be adapted"
"to understand the origin of the Universe."
and what he had in mind, you see, was that if, just mentally, you reverse the sense of time, you can think of the expanding universe as a collapsing system, it's a bit like a giant, a very giant star collapsing
Roger Penrose proved that a dying star collapsing under its own gravity eventually shrinks to a singluarity, a point of infinite density and zero size.
I realized that if I reversed the direction of time, so that the collapse become an expansion,
I could prove that the Universe had a beginning.
But my proof, based on Einstein's theory of General Relativity, also showed that we cannot understand how the universe began, because it showed that all scientific theories, incuding General Relativity itself, break down at the beginning of the Universe.
We had this meeting at the Institute of Space Physics in New York.
I said: "Before we reach a final conclusion,"
"we ought to throw into the pot"
"still another object:"
"a gravitationally completely collapsed object."
Well, after you've used the phrase:
"a gravitationally completely collapsed object"
ten times, you conclude you've get to get a better name, so that's when I switched to the word 'black hole'.
The word 'black hole', which John Miller coined, suddenly caught on.
Everybody adopted it and from then on people around the world, in Moscow,
in America, in England and elsewhere, could know they were speaking about the same thing.
And not only that, but suddenly the hole range of concept's got throught to the general public, and even science fiction writers all of a sudden could talk about it.
Tonight, my friends,
We stand on the break of a feat unparalleled in space exploration.
If the data in my returning probe ship matches my computerized calculations,
I will travel where no man has dared to go.
Into the black hole?
In...
Through...
And behind!
Why that's crazy!
Ah!
Impossible!
As a massive star contracts, its gravity becomes so strong that light can no longer escape.
The region from which nothing can escape is called a 'black hole' and its boundary is called the 'event horizon'.
One might say of the event horizon what Dante said of the entrance to Hell:
"Abandon all hope ye who eneter here."
I was once asked to actually be an adjudicator on an essay of which the subject was:
"How to fall into a black hole and live"
Now, the problem I had was that I wouldn't know how to give out the prize, because if I said: "Well, that looks like a really good essay", the only real way of showing that this was right
was to actually follow it, to do the experiment of fall in, but then having fallen in, also I would assume taking the person who wrote the essay with you, the question would be:
"How do you tell the rest of the world?"
Do you take the prize in with you that you'd give to him, and what do they do with it when do when get to the center?
Beleive me
I've benn waiting a long time for someone like you to record this moment.
Thank you, doctor.
Then, I'm ready.
Ready to embark on man's greatest journey.
Certainly his riskiest.
The risk is incidental compared to the possibility to possess the great truth of the unknown.
There, long cherished laws of nature simply do not apply.
They vanish.
And life?
Life?
Life forever.
If you were watching an anoustronaut fool hardly enough to jump into a black hole, at some time on his watch, say 12 o'clock, he will cross the event horizon and enter the black hole.
But no matter how long you waited, you would never see the astronaut's watch reach 12 o'clock.
Instead, each second on the watch would appear to take longer and longer until the last second before midnight would take forever.
Thus, by jumping into a black hole, one could ensure that one's image lasted forever.
But the picture would fade very rapidly and grow so dim that no one could see it.
When somebody disappears into the black hole as seen from the outside, you...
it looks like time actually slows down.
and the person becomes...
who's moving or at least he thinks he's moving and talking in his spaceship at a normal rate, seems to slow down and ends up by being frozen in a particular position as seen from somebody watching from the outside,
and as seen from the outside you never see what happens after that.
The astronout wouldn't notice anything special when his watch reached midnight and he crossed the event horizon into the black hole.
Until of course he approached the singularity and was crushed into spaghetti.
One can fall though this event horizon without feeling anything, without noticing it.
After about a week of falling, one begins to feel a pinch, and one extends longer and longer and gets slightly thinner and of course one begins to get squeezed, until one gets very long and very thin
and rather nasty.
By the end of two weeks one's fallen right into the center and one is of course dead.
Before you lose sight of the outer world, you would see things happening and you would see them at a greater rate so that it would look like a firework display.
And the frustration would be that, although you would be able to see everything that happens in the future, it would be going so fast from the scientific point of view, you would have no time to analyze it,
you wouldn't be able to take it in.
And eventually things would be going so fast and it would be so explosive that you yourself would be destroyed by the explosion and that would be the end.
But it would be a very exciting way to end one's life.
It would be the way I would choose if I had the choice.
In the long history of the Universe, many stars must have burned up their nucelar fuel and collapsed in on themselves.
The number of black holes may be greater than the number of visibile stars, which totals about a hundred thousand million in our galaxy alone.
We also have evidence that there is a very large black hole at the centre of our own galaxy.
Friends ask me:
"Well, if a black hole is black, how can you see it?"
And i say: "Have you have you ever been to a ball?"
"Have you ever watched the young man dressed in their evening tuxedos"
"and the girls in their white dresses, whirling around, held in each other's arms?"
"And the lights turn low, and all you can see is the girls."
Well, the girl is the ordinary star and the boy is the black hole.
You can't see the black hole any more that you can see the boy, but the girl going around gives you convincing evidence there must be something there, holding her in orbit.
One evening, shortly after the birth of my daughter, Lucy,
I started thinking about black holes as I was getting into bed.
My disability made this a rather slow process, so I had plenty of time.
Suddenly, I realized that the area of the event horizon must always increase with time.
The increase in the area of the event horizon was reminiscent of a quantity called entropy, which measures the degree of disorder of a system.
It is a matter of common experience that disorder tends to increase with time if things are left at themselves.
Jacob Bekenstein came into the office one day.
"Jakob," I said, "it always troubles me:"
"when I put a hot tea cup next to a cold tea cup, I've increased,"
"by letting heat flow from one to the other,"
"the amount of disorder in the Universe."
"But Jakob, if a black hole swirls by,"
"and I drop both tea cups into this,"
"I conceal the evidence of my crime, have I not?"
Bekenstein's a man of great integrity and he looked troubled, and he came back to me later and he said: "No, you have not concealed the evidence of your crime."
"The black hole records what's happened to you."
Stephen Hawking read the paper in which Bekenstein announced his result and thought it was preposterous and decided to prove that it was wrong.
My dicoveries led Jacob Bekenstein to suggest that the area of the event horizon actually was the entropy of the black hole.
But there was one fatal flaw in Bekenstein's idea:
if black holes have an entropy, they ought to have a temperature.
And if they have a temperature, they ought to give off radiation.
But how could they give off radiation if nothing can escape from a black hole?
As it turned out, Bekenstein was basically correct, though in a manner far more surprising than he, or anyone else, had expected.
As he gradually lost the use of his hands, he had to start developing... carefully chosing research projects that could be tackled and solved through geometrical arguments that he could do pictorially in his head.
and he developed a very powerful set of tools that noboby else really had so in some sense, when you lose one set of tools you may develop other tools, but these new tools are amenable to different kind of problems than the old tools
and if you're the only master in the world of these new tools, that means certain kinds of problems you can solve and nobody else can.
My work up to 1973 was in General Relativity and was summarized in a book which I wrote with George Ellis called "The large scale structure of space-time".
Even then, it was difficult for me to write things down.
So I tended to think in pictures and diagrams that I could visualize in my head.
I remember visiting Stephen and Jane at their home in Cambrigde.
After supper in the evening when it was time for Stephen to go to bed
Jane instisted and Stephen acquiesced,
I guess this was standard, that Stephen make his way up.
I forgot whether there's one flight of stairs or two flight of stairs, alone and this was a period that he can no longer walk.
the way he got up the stairs was he grabbed hold of the pillars that support the banister and pulled him up with the strength of his own, pulled himself up the stairs by the strength of his own arms,
dragging himself up from the ground floor up to the second storey in a long, arduous effort.
Jane explained that this was an important part of his physical therapy to maintain his coordination and strength as long as possible.
at first, it was sort of hard rending to watch what appeared to be the agony of pulling up the starirs until I understood it was just part of life pulling himself up the stairs like that.
General Relativity is what is called a classical theory.
It predicts a single definite path for each particle.
But according to quantum mechanics, there is an element of chance or uncertainty.
A particle does not have just a single path through space and time.
Instead, there is an uncertainty principle according to which both the exact position and velocity of the particle can never be known.
I began investigating the effect of quantum mechanics might have on particles near a black hole.
I found that particles could escapoe from a black hole, that black holes are not completely black.
At first, I didn't believe it.
But when I redid the calculations, I couldn't get the effect to go away.
I met martin Reese and he was shaking with excitement.
And he said: "Have you heard, have you heard!"
"What Stephen has discovered?
Everything is different!
everything is changed!"
I was still unsure of my discovery so I only told a few colleagues.
But word soon spread.
Roger Penrose phoned up on my birthday.
He was very excited and went on so long that my birthday dinner got quite cold.
It was a great pity because it was goose, which I'm very fond of.
To me it's a miracle, because it's a complicated and messy calculation.
we can now do these things very much better and it's more transparent what happens.
But out of this messy calculation, he showed that black holes aren't black.
With this quanto-mechanical effect which was a residual radiation.
Stephen came to a meeting and people were flabbergasted.
I remember someone getting up and saying:
"You must be wrong Stephen."
"I don't believe a word of it!"
I once said that I was unhappy with the explanation given in terms of negative energy particles being created.
But I feel this is part of the controversy of science.
You must have the give and take.
And I'm delighted to be able to be part of that.
I mean, it's what makes it fun.
You know, if you all sat down and said: "Oh, lovely!"
when you do have niggling questions in your mind that's not doing a good service to science.
But I was not antagonistic to it in any way, except for that one time when I questioned.
I finally conviced myself that black holes radiated when I found a mechanism through whcih this could happen.
According to quantum mechanics, space is filled with virtual particles and anti-particles that are constantly materializing in pairs, separating, coming together again and annihilating each other.
In the presence of a black hole, one member of a pair of virtual particles may fall into the hole, leaving the other member without a partner whith which to annihilate.
The forsaken particle appears to be radiation emitted by the black hole.
And so, black holes are not eternal.
They evaporate away at an increasing rate until they vanish in a gigantic explosion.
Quantum mechanics has allowed particles and radiation to escape from the ultimate prison:
a black hole.
Einstein never accepted quantum mechanics because of its element of chance and uncertainty.
He said:
"God does not play dice".
It seems that Einstein was doubly wrong.
The quantum effects of black holes suggests that not only does God play dice, he sometimes throw them where they cannot be seen.
He says himself that he wouldn't have got where he is if he hadn't been ill.
And I think that's quite possible, because it's like Johnson said, you know:
"Knowledge to be hanged in the morning concentrates the mind wonderfully".
And he has concentrated on this in a way that I don't think he would have done because he always took a great interest in a lot of things in life and I don't know if he would have applied himself in quite the same way
if he'd been able to get around as is.
So in a way...
No, I can't think anyone's lucky of having an illness like that, even still, but it's bad less luck for him that it would be for some people, if you see what I mean,
because he can so much live in his head.
When I lived with the Hawking family I would usually get up around 7h15 or 7h30, and take a shower and then read my bible some in the morning and pray.
And then I would go down at 8h15 to get Stephen up.
And then at breakfast I would often tell him what I'd been reading in the bible hoping that, you know, maybe this would eventually have some influence.
So then we would get into work and usually we'd go and see if there were any scientific papers that people sent out and.
I did discover that despite Hawking's great brain he reads quite slowly.
I mean, I can read about twice as fast as him.
But of course, the point is he would have to read to memory because it would be very difficult for him to go back and access the thing.
Wherheas I can skim the paper rather quickly and see if there was anything interesting in it and if I wanted to work on it
I can pick the thing up and look at it.
Black hole radiation has shown us that gravitational collapse is not as final as we once thought.
If an astronaut falls into a black hole, he will be returned to the rest of the Universe in the form of radiation.
Thus, in a sense, the astronaut will be recycled.
However, it would be a poor sort of immortality because any personal concept of time would come to an end as he is torn apart inside a black hole.
All that would survive would be his mass, or energy.
One year the Hawkings took me along when we went to a cottage in Wales near the river Wye.
And this cottage was up a hill and there was a bit of a paved, well, sidewalk that went up to the cottage which I had not been up.
And of course I wanted to do it in the least number of trips that I could imagine, so we put Stephen's batteries under his chair, I mean his wheelchair has space for batteries, and put extra batteries under there, which we...
Stephen didn't realize he had...
that I put under there, he didn't realize his chair was as heavily laden as possible.
So Stephen was quite a bit ahead of me and then he was turning the corner to go on to... around to his house, but that was on a slope and...
So I looked up and I noticed
Stephen's wheelchair was slowly tipping backward.
And of course that was about 10 meters away.
I tried to roll up there but of course I wasn't able to get there nearly rapidly enough before he'd toppled over backward into the bushes.
And this was a bit of a shocking sight, to see this master of gravity getting overcome by the weak gravitational force of Earth!
One of the worst things for me would be having people there all the time, never alone I reckon, really.
And yet he finds thigs funny and he enjoys life and he goes dashing about all over the place.
And I think this is tremendous, that this is the sort of courage I haven't got, that his father hadn't got.
And we cannot but admire it, but I wonder how on earth he got it, really!
There must have been 50 people there and I was standing off in a corner, sort of, watching quietly for a few minutes, relaxing.
And Stephen was not far from me.
Jane walked over to Stephen and looked at him and he was sitting with his head on his lap, like only Stephen can put his head in his lap, and Jane said to Stephen:
"You look miserable Stephen!"
Sit up straight!"
"Some of your guests don't understand"
"that you're sitting there thinking about physics and having a wonderful time,"
"it looks like you're in pain.
Sit up straight and go talk to your guests."
In 1979, I was elected Lucasian Professor of Mathematics.
This is the same chair once held by Isaac Newton.
They a have a big book which every university teaching officer is supposed to sign.
After I had been Lucasian Professor for about a year they realized I had never signed.
So they brought the book to my office and I signed it with some difficulty.
That was the last time I signed my name.
My interest in the origin and fate of the Universe was reawakened when I attended a conference on cosmology in the Vatican.
Afterwards, we were granted an audience with the pope.
He told us that it was all right to study the evolution of the Universe after the Big Bang,
but we should not inquire into the Big Bang itself, because that was the moment of creation, and therefore, the work of God.
I was glad that he did not know the subject of the talk I had just given:
the possibility that the Universe had no beginning, no moment of creation.
There were theories in the early 70s, in fact the first type of creation theories, where the people concerned started off with a fixed external space and time which for eternity was empty.
Then suddenly, for some unknown reason, Universe nucleates in a point and then Bang!
It blows apart.
But the trouble is that when the space and time appear in the classical theory the actual point itself is a singualr point in the mathematics.
Mathematics breaks down, and so you cannot in fact use that to give you a creation theory.
If one goes back in time, one comes to the Big Bang singularity, where the laws of Physics break down.
But there's another direction of time that one can go in, which avoids the singularity.
This is called the imaginary direction of time.
In imaginary time, there need not be any sigularities which form a beginning or end to time.
When you come to imaginary time, you have this rather peculiar possibility of having a 'now', as it were, not necessarily having a sort of a chain of past moments.
If we start to lay out the moments that run in backwards in time, as it were, then for a long time things work perfectly normally.
But then as you begin to get further and further back towards what would be the origin point in a conventional real time picture you'd find that the nature of time changes, that the imaginary component becomes more and more prominent,
and in the end, what ought be a singular point in the classical theory just gets smoothed away and you have this beautiful picture, this bowl, where the creation of the Universe is pictured, as where we are now
in a smooth sort of bowl past where there's no initial point, just a sort of smooth shape.
So long as the Universe had a beginning, we could suppose it had a Creator.
But if the Universe is completely self-contained, having no boudary or edge,
it would neither be created nor destroyed, it would simply be.
What place then, for a Creator?
What we can really say is that the Universe is, bacuse it is a self-consistent mathematical structure.
There's no past because, unlike the creation point scenario there's nothing for it to be created into
So to say it's created from nothing is actually a bit of a misnomer, it's a misleading use of the word 'nothing'.
It's not just that there was empty space in which the Universe appeared, which you might call 'nothing', there was really nothing at all because there wasn't even a creation event, you see.
The use of past tense in a verb becomes inappropriate in these theories.
Unfortunately, tenses were set up when people believed in real time, of course, and we don't yet have a linguistic form to describe tenses in imaginary time.
The word 'time' was not handed down from Heaven, as a gift from On High.
The idea of 'time' is a word invented by men, and if it has puzzlements connected with it, whose fault is it?
It's our fault!
Where does the difference between the past and the future come from?
The laws of science do not distinguish between the past and the future.
Yet, there is a big difference between the past and future in ordinary life.
You may see a cup of tea fall off a table and break into pieces on the floor, but you will never see a cup gather together and jump back on the table.
The increase of disorder or entropy is what distinguishes the past from the future, giving the direction to time.
He fell ill in Switzerland.
When he came back, he was on a ventilator.
Because he was on a ventilator, you've got a tube down your throat, and therefore you can't speak, just for that reason.
For that period, which might have been a couple of months,
I spent probably one in two nights, one in three nights, at the hospital, because when he was in hospital he couldn't communicate with the nurses.
And it's not just like being seriously ill, but you're in a position where the nurses couldn't understand what Stephen wanted.
If Stephen was unconfortable, they couldn't tell why.
Before I caught pneumonia, my speech had been getting more slurred so that only a few people who knew me well could understand me.
But at least I could communicate.
I wrote scientific papers by dictating to a secretary and I gave seminars through an interpreter.
And then, a tracheotomy operation removed my ability to speak altogether.
After a long time, well it seemed like along time, somebody came up with this brilliant gadget.
They didn't have it in Cambridge hosptal, they got it from somewhere in London.
This was high technology:
how can you communicate with a person with no voice?
It's plastic piece of Perspex, about so big, and you've got the letters of the alphabet arranged like that and a hole in the middle.
You hold it up between you and the other person and they look at a letter, and you can see of course which letter they're looking at, most of the time, sometimes you can't quite be sure,
and so you get the patient to spell out what they wanted, you know, so each letter you have to look:
speak out the A, and you say: "A?" You get it right.
It's like a guessing game.
Stephen wasn't going to accept that he wasn't going to speak again and he thought that he would be giving in by trying to find a method of communicating without speech.
And I remember I went to him one evening, and this was the first time that he asked to be gotten out of bed to use a computer.
Sometimes, they were sitting him up so that he wasn't lying in the bed all the time, as you do with a patient, but this time, when I turned up, he asked the nurse could he be gotten out of bed
so he could use the computer, and he did.
I remember the first thing he typed in there, after saying 'hello',
-Stephen's always being very polite about things like that- was: "Will you help me finish my book?"
A computer expert in California heard of my plight and sent me a computer program called Equalizer.
This allowed me to select words from a series of menus on a screen by pressing a switch in my hand.
These words could then be sent to a speech synthesizer attached to my wheelchair.
Much to my surprise,
I found I was able to communicate much better than before.
When eventually he went home from hospital, and he was told he needed 24h nursing, and everyone was saying:
"Well, how is he gonna go in and do work,"
"is he going to trail around with a series of nurses after him working in the office?"
And of course he did!
I mean, they talked originally of him working at home, which he wasn't happy with,
so after a period of recuperation home he just decided to go back into the office, and he made the trip from his house to the office which is, I don't know, half a mile, in his wheelchair,
And the nurses were walking along with him.
And this is at the time when he was still driving around with a bag and a nasal drip.
Going into the department, working, going back home.
I began to wonder what would happen when the Universe stopped expanding and began to contract.
Would we see broken cups gather themselves together off the floor and jump back on to the table?
Would we be able to remember tomorrow's prices and make a fortune off the stock market?
It seemed to me the Universe had to return to a smooth and ordered state when it recollapsed.
If this were so, time would go backwards when the Universe began to collapse.
People in the contracting phase would live their lives backwards, they would die before they were born and get younger as the Universe got small again.
Eventually, they would return to the womb.
He gave me my first problem to do.
He asked me to look at this mathematical problem and ususally, when he gives a problem, he has a good idea of what the answer should be.
And I went to look at it and it took me a few months to understand what was it about and I came back and I said:
"Stephen I get this answer."
And he said to me: "No, that is not what I expected."
I said: "Stephen that's what I get."
And so I went to the blackboard, explained to him what it was.
He said: "Did you think about that particular case?"
I said: "Oh no I didn't!"
So I went back
I calculated what he talked to me about, came back a few weeks after and I said:
"Stephen, I don't get this thing.
I still get the same answer I had originally."
So he said to me:
"No no no, this is not right,"
"did you think about that?" "Oh no!"
"I'd forgotten about that particular case."
So I went back to the drawing board, started calculating again.
And again, get the same answer!
I went back to see Stephen, and this dragged on for about 2 or 3 months.
Finally he said to me: "Maybe,"
"one of your approximations isn't valid."
So me and a collegue decided to do this thing with computers, and than this takes a lot of time to write the programs and to be sure the program was correct...
We get the answer and it was still the way that I said before and not the way that Stephen has said, so we went to see Stephen and we said: "You see?
Again!"
I had make a mistake.
I had been using too simple a model of the Universe.
Time will not reverse direction when the Universe begins to contract.
People will continue to get older, so it is no good waiting until the universe recollapses to return to our youth.
Einstein once asked a question:
"How much choice did God have in constructing the Universe?"
If my proposal that the universe has no boundary is correct, he had no freedom at all to choose how the Universe began.
He would only have had a freedom to choose the laws the Universe obeyed.
This, however, may not have been all that much of a choice.
They may be well be only one unified theory that allows for the existence of structures as complicated as human beings, who can investigate the laws of the Universe and ask about the nature of God.
I don't know how clear-cut these experiments are, but there are experiments that have been done on, sort of, timing of conciousness, and they seem to lead to a very odd picture which doesn't even quite make consistent sense.
Whether refinement of these experiments might actually get rid of this kind of anomaly
I'm not sure, but it does look a little as though there's something very odd about conciousness, and somehow almost as though future affects the past in some way over a very tiny limited scale but something maybe of the order of a reasonable fraction of a second.
And there's no reason to believe that one's conscious experience shouldn't be part of somebody else's at some other stage, I mean.
I don't if it's fair to say what happens after one dies but you could... it's a plausible picture that you could be sombody else.
And that somebody else could be somebody who lived in the past, not in the future.
If there's only one possible unified theory that is just a set of rules and equations,
what is it that breathes fire into the equations and makes a Universe for them to describe?
Why does the Universe go to all the bother of existing?
Is the unified theory so compelling that it brings about its own existence?
Or does it need a Creator?
And if so, who created Him?
I think I would say that the Universe has a purpose, it's not somehow just there by chance,
I mean, I think it's...
Some people, I think, take the view that the Universe is just there and it sort of rumbles along and it just sort of computes, we happen somehow by accident and found ourselves in this thing.
But I don't think that's a very fruitful or helpful way of looking at the Universe.
I think that there's something much deeper about it.
In real time, the time in which we live, the Universe has two possible destinies:
it may continue to expand forever, or it may recollapse and come to an end at a Big Crunch.
It would be rather like the big Bang, but in reverse.
I now believe that the Universe will come to an end at a Big Crunch.
I do, however, have certain advantages over many other prophets of doom:
whatever happens 10 billion years from now,
I don't expect to be around to be proved wrong.
Of all the pictures that I know, the simplest of any cosmology is that in which the Universe is closed, has a finite lifetime, and collapses with the same kind of collapse that a black hole does.
If it should turn out that indeed the Universe is limited in its life, how is that different from the life of each one of us?
On the evening of Tuesday, March 5th, at about 10h45,
I was returning to my flat in Pinehurst.
It was dark and raining.
I came up to Grange Road and saw headlights approaching, but judged that they were far enough away that I could cross safely.
The vehicle must have been travelling very fast, for when I got just past the middle of the road, my nurse screamed:
"Look out!"
I heard tires skidding and my wheelchair was struck a tremendous blow in the back.
I ended up in the road, with my legs over the remains of the wheelchair.
The accident destroyed my wheelchair and damaged my computer system with which I communicate.
I required 13 stitches in my head, but I was able to go back to work several days later.
The memories I have are very much, kind of, visual pictures of what Stephen was.
I've seen Stephen in certains situations.
He was always moving, always.
He was hardly ever still.
It was the same thing about his face and gestures, which he used a great deal, I should say.
But it's only memory.
I found some photographs recently which reminded me of the general look of everybody.
I must say Stephen looked very much as he does now.
If one thinks of him like that.
He does believe very intensely in almost infinite possibility of the human mind.
You have to find out what you can't know before you know you can't, don't you?
So I don't think that thought should be restricted at all, and there's... why shouldn't you go on thinking about the unthinkable?
Somebody's got to start sometime.
I mean, think how many things were unthinkable a century ago.
And yet people have thought them.
And often they seemed quite impractical.
Not all things Stephen says probably are to be taken as Gospel.
truth is, he's a searcher, he's looking for things and if he is sometimes, he probably talks nonsense as we all... but the point is:
people must think.
People must go on thinking.
They must try to extend the boundaries of knowledge, and they don't sometimes even know where to start.
We don't know where the boundaries are, do we?
We don't know what the taking off point is.
If we do discover a complete theory of the Universe, it should, in time, be understandable, in broad principle, by everyone, not just a few scientists.
Then we shall all, philosophers, scientists and just ordinary people, be able to take part in the discussion on why it is that we, and the Universe, exist.
If we find the answer to that, it would be the ultimate triumph of human reason.
For then we would know the mind of God.
Which came first... the chicken or the egg?
Did the universe have a beginning... and if so, what happened before then?
Where did the universe come from... and where is it going?
Luck.
Luck.
Well... we have been very lucky...
I mean, my family and Stephen and everybody.
You have your disasters, but the point is that we have survived.
Everybody has disasters, and yet some people disappear... and are never seen again.
Flying bombs are very alarming.
They came buzzing over... and then they would cut out.
And when you heard the bang, you knew it wasn't you... so you went back to your meal or whatever.
But one did fall quite close to our house... and it blew the back windows out... so that the glass was sticking dagger points all out of the opposite wall.
When Stephen was born, we decided... he'd better be born in Oxford.
So while I was staying in the hospital...
I went to Blackwell's in Oxford... and I bought an astronomical atlas.
One of my sisters-in-law said...
"This is a very prophetic thing for you to have done."
How real is time?
Will it ever come to an end?
Where does the difference... between the past and the future come from?
Why do we remember the past... but not the future?
I can remember the day... when we traveled through London and the blackout was over.
And the trains, instead of being shut in... by blinds so that you just traveled in a train... we were coming over one of the bridges... and all the lights...
well, such lights as were left... were on in London, but it was also a completely starry night... and you could see the light.
It was beautiful.
I remember we all used to lie on the grass, looking straight up through a telescope... and seeing the wonders of the stars.
Stephen always had a strong sense of wonder... and I could see that the stars would draw him... and further than the stars.
I was born exactly 300 years... after the death of Galileo.
I estimate that about 200,000 other babies... were also born that day.
I don't know whether any of them... was later interested in astronomy.
My first memory is of Isobel... pushing a rather antiquated... carriage-built pram along North Road... with Stephen and Mary in it... sort of looking very large... because they had large heads and pink cheeks, and they were very noticeable.
They all looked different from ordinary people.
I can remember visiting the Hawking home... oh, several times.
It was the sort of place where, if invited to stay to supper... you might, uh... be allowed to have your conversation with Stephen... but the rest of the family would be sitting... at the table reading a book... a behavior which was not really approved of in my circle... but which was tolerated from the Hawkings... because they were recognized to be... very eccentric, highly intelligent... very clever people... but still a bit odd.
My impression of the Hawking family was that they were all like that... except for Stephen, who seemed to be... the only normal member of the family.
Stephen used to reckon he knew, I think it was... 11 ways of getting into the house, and I could only find ten.
I'm not sure where the other way was.
On the north side of the house was a bicycle shed.
It had a door at the front and a door at the back.
Above that, there was a window into the L-shaped room... and at the front you could get sort of around the corner... onto the roof... and from that level... you could get onto the main roof.
I think one of the ways...
Stephen could get in was on the main roof.
As I say, he was a much better climber than I was.
I still didn't know what the 11th one was.
Before the 20th century... it was thought that the universe had existed forever... or had been created at some time in the past... more or less as we observe it today.
People found comfort in the thought... that even though they may grow old and die... the universe was eternal and unchanging.
I gave up playing games with Stephen... oh, when he was ill that time when he was about 12... because he started taking games terribly seriously.
We had Monopoly... and first of all... the Monopoly board sprang railways going across it... to add to the complications... and then Monopoly just wasn't adaptable enough.
He ended up with a fearful game called Dynasty... which, as far as I can make out...
I never played it... went on forever because there was no way of ending it.
It was almost a substitute for living, as far as I could make out.
It took hours and hours and hours.
I thought it was a perfectly terrible game.
I couldn't imagine anyone getting taken up with that.
But Stephen always had a very complicated mind... and I felt as much as anything... it was the complication of it that appealed to him.
When I was in high school, I learned that light... from distant galaxies was shifted to the red.
This meant that they were moving away from us... and that the universe was expanding.
But I didn't believe it.
A static universe seemed much more natural.
It could have existed... and could continue to exist forever.
We were discussing the possibility... of the spontaneous generation of life... and I think that Stephen made a remark... which indicated not only that he'd thought of this... but he'd even also... come across some calculations... as to how long it might take.
At that time, I think I made a comment... to one of my friends, John McClenahan...
"I think that Stephen... will turn out to be unusually capable."
I don't think I put it in quite those words... but I made some such remark to him... and he disagreed.
And so we made a bet on the subject.
In our childish way, we bet... a bag of sweets on the issue.
And incidentally, I reckon that my bet has come correct... and I think I'm entitled to payment... which has not yet been made.
The expansion of the universe... suggested the possibility... that the universe had a beginning... at some time in the past.
The point at which the universe may have started out... became known as the Big Bang.
The first year he was at St. Albans School... he came, I think, third from the bottom.
I said, "Well, Stephen... do you really have to be as far down as that?"
And he said, "Well... a lot of other people didn't do much better."
He was quite unconcerned.
Somehow he was always recognized... as being very bright... and in fact they gave him the Divinity Prize one year.
That was not surprising because his father used to read him...
Bible stories from a very early age... and he knew them all very well... and he was quite well-versed in religious things... although I don't think he makes a great deal of practice of it now.
Everybody used to argue theology.
That's a good, safe subject.
You don't need any facts or... distracting things like that.
If you go in for arguing... you know, debating... you can quite happily debate about anything... including theology... and the existence or otherwise of God.
And then someone gets bored... or Journey Into Space comes on, or something like that... and the argument breaks up.
In an unchanging universe... one can imagine that God created the universe... at literally any time in the past.
On the other hand... if the universe is expanding... there may be physical reasons... why there had to be a beginning.
An expanding universe does not preclude a creator... but it does place limits... on when he might have carried out his job.
When the family went to India... it was arranged that Stephen should come and live with us for a year.
He decided it would be nice... that we should have...
Scottish dancing in the evening.
Mind you, this was quite an ordinary house... but we had rather a lot of room and a large hall... and so we bought some records... and a book about what to do... and Stephen took charge.
And he insisted you put on a jacket and a tie.
And then he was the master of the proceedings.
And Stephen took it very seriously.
But then he liked dancing, you see?
There were four physicists in my year...
Gordon Berry...
Richard Bryan...
Stephen... myself.
I first remember Stephen... on an occasion when Gordon and I went up after dinner to his room... to try to find him.
And Stephen was up there... with a crate of beer... slowly drinking his way through it.
He was only 17.
He couldn't legally go into a pub.
He'd gone up to Oxford ridiculously early.
We used to have what we called a gathering net.
We used to organize a beer party and various things like that... to gather all these... collar as many freshman as we could get... to get them to join the Boat Club.
And that's how we collected him, you see?
But the question always with Stephen was...
"Should we make him the cox of the first eight... or the second eight?"
Well, coxes can be adventurous... and some coxes can be very steady people.
He was rather an adventurous type.
You never knew quite what he was going to do... when he went out with the crew.
I think he used to bring his work with him into the boat sometimes.
His sort of thinking gear was going... on different levels.
We were asked to read chapter 10... in a book called Electricity and Magnetism... by Bleaney and Bleaney, an unlikely combination... a husband-and-wife team... and at the end of that chapter, there were 13 questions... all of them final honors questions.
I discovered very rapidly that I couldn't do any of them.
Richard and I worked together for the week... and we managed to do 1 1/2 questions... which we felt very proud of.
Gordon refused all assistance... and managed to do one all by himself.
Stephen, as always, hadn't even started... but the next morning, he went up to his rooms at 9:00... and we came back about 12:00, maybe five past 12:00... and down came Stephen, and we were in the college gateway, the lodge.
"Ah, Hawking," I said, "how many have you managed to do, then?"
"Well," he said, "I've only had time to do the first ten."
I think at that point we realized that it's not just we weren't in the same street.
We weren't on the same planet.
I once calculated... that I did about 1,000 hours' work... in the three years I was at Oxford... an average of an hour a day.
I am not proud of this lack of work.
I am just describing my attitude at the time... an attitude that nothing was worth making an effort for.
He used to produce his work every week for tutorial... and, as he never kept any notes... or papers or that sort of thing... on leaving my room, he would normally throw it in my wastepaper basket.
And when he was with other undergraduates at the tutorial... and they saw this happen, they were absolutely horrified... 'cause they thought, he did this work in probably half an hour...
If they could have done it in a year, they wouldn't have thrown it in the wastepaper basket.
They would've put it in a frame on their walls.
Because of my lack of work...
I had planned to get through the final exam... by doing problems in theoretical physics... and avoiding any questions that required factual knowledge.
I didn't do very well.
I was on the borderline between a first- and second-class degree... and I had to be interviewed to determine which I should get.
They asked me about my future plans.
I replied, if they gave me a first...
I would go to Cambridge.
If I only got a second...
I would stay in Oxford.
They gave me a first.
I drove Stephen and his young brother... out to Woburn Park... and he climbed a tree.
He was testing himself out, I think.
I didn't realize.
He did manage to climb a tree... and go along a branch of it and get himself down.
I think he began to notice that his hands... were less useful than they had been... but he didn't tell us.
Univ has these square staircases... which are round but they're square.
It was just coming down from one of the rooms.
Steve actually fell on the stairs coming downstairs... and kind of bounced all the way down to the bottom.
I don't know if he lost consciousness, but he lost his memory.
We took him to either my room or someone's room.
The first question of course was, "Who am I?"
We told him, "You're Steve Hawking."
Right away he would ask again, "Who am I?"
"Steve Hawking."
Then, after a couple of minutes, he remembered he was Steve Hawking.
Then we'd say, "Do you remember going down to the bar... and having a drink on Sunday night?"
Or, "Do you remember coxing on the river on Monday?"
And his memory came back gradually... until he could remember the previous day's events, and then the previous hour... and by the end of the two hours, he could remember everything.
The question was, "Well, maybe you've lost... some of your mind because of this."
And so Steve decided, "Well, I'll take the Mensa test."
We said, "Of course you'll get in."
But he came back delighted he was able to get into Mensa.
Absolutely delighted.
I felt that there were two areas... of theoretical physics...
I might study at Cambridge.
One was cosmology, the study of the very large.
The other was elementary particles... the study of the very small.
However, I thought elementary particles... were less attractive... because there was no proper theory.
All they could do... was arrange the particles in families... like in botany.
In cosmology, on the other hand... there was a well-defined theory...
Einstein's general theory of relativity.
It was a very cold year... and the ice on Verulamium Pond... it was frozen there... and we all went skating.
And Stephen managed to skate fairly well... but then, he and I were close together.
He wasn't skating in a very advanced way... but nor was I, if it comes to that.
He fell... and he couldn't get up.
So I took him to a café to warm up... and he told me then all about it.
And it was diagnosed.
I insisted on going to see his doctor... because it seemed to me however long you're going to live... there's probably something someone can do about it... at least anyhow to make things easier for people.
I won't mention the doctor's name... but I got to see him at the London Clinic.
He was rather surprised that I should bother to come 'round to see him.
After all, I was only Stephen's mother.
He was quite nice.
He agreed to see me in a rather grand way.
And he said, "Yes, it's all very sad.
Brilliant young man cut off in the prime of his youth."
But of course I said, "What can we do?
What can we do to sort of...
Can we get physiotherapy?
Can we get anything like that that will help in any way?"
He said, "Well, actually, no.
There's nothing I can do, really.
More or less, that's it."
Shortly after my 21st birthday...
I went into hospital for tests.
They took a muscle sample from my arm... stuck electrodes into me... and injected some radiopaque fluid into my spine... and watched it going up and down with X-rays... as they tilted the bed.
I was diagnosed as having ALS... amyotrophic lateral sclerosis... or motor neuron disease, as it is also known.
The doctors could offer no cure... and gave me 2 1/2 years to live.
I went into the graduates' common room... looking, really, for someone to have lunch with.
There was nobody around that I particularly wished to have lunch with... and then Stephen walked through the door.
I don't know what he was doing at Oxford.
I've certainly forgotten now.
And so Stephen generously went off... to buy the drinks... and brought them and put them on the table.
And as he put his pint of beer down... he spilled it.
I sort of said genially...
"Oh, heavens.
Drinking at this time of day!"
He then told me he'd been in Addenbrooke's for three weeks... and they'd done a whole series of tests... and they'd decided... what was wrong with him.
And he told me very straight and flat... that he was gradually going to lose... the use of his body... that eventually... only his heart and his lungs... would still be operating, and his brain... and that they'd told him that... eventually he would essentially have the body of a cabbage... but his mind would still be in perfect working order... and he would be unable to communicate with the rest of the world.
My dreams at that time were rather disturbed.
Before my condition had been diagnosed...
I had been very bored with life.
There had not seemed to be anything worth doing.
But shortly after I came out of hospital...
I dreamt that I was going to be executed.
I suddenly realized there were a lot of worthwhile things...
I could do if I were reprieved.
I knew perfectly well that he had no faith... and... to me, that made it the more difficult... because you must ask yourself, "Why me?
Why this?
Why now?"
But he just totally, flatly accepted... that this was what was going to happen to him.
As far as I can gather, at that point he started to do some work.
At first, there did not seem much point... in working at my research... because I didn't expect to live long enough... to finish my PhD.
However, as time went by... the disease seemed to slow down.
I began to understand general relativity... and made progress with my work.
But what really made a difference was...
I had got engaged to a girl called Jane Wilde.
This gave me something to live for... but it also meant I had to get a job... if we were to get married.
Stephen was already ill.
Jane knew it.
And it was another instance of Stephen's luck, you know... meeting the right person at the right time... because Stephen was very, very badly depressed... and he wasn't very much inclined to go on with his work.
He'd been told he's only got 2 1/2 years.
What can you do in that time?
But meeting Jane really put him on his mettle... and he started to work.
I wanted to understand... how the universe began.
Einstein's theory of general relativity... showed that the universe was expanding.
But there was no answer to the crucial question...
"Must there have been a Big Bang... a beginning to time?"
Then, in my third year at Cambridge...
Roger Penrose made his discovery... about the death of stars.
I remember talking to this friend, Ivor Robinson... and we were having this animated conversation... and then we had to cross a road... and as we crossed the road, of course, the conversation stopped... and then we got to the other side.
Evidently, I had some idea crossing the road... but then the conversation started up, and it got completely blotted out of my mind.
It was only later, after my friend had gone home... and I began to have this strange feeling of elation... feeling wonderful.
I couldn't figure out why I should feel like that, so I went back over the day... thinking all possible things which might have contributed to such a feeling... and then gradually I unearthed this thought... which I'd had while crossing the street.
Penrose announced this result... that when stars collapse indefinitely... they will become singular... as long as some very broad conditions are satisfied... that everybody would have regarded as reasonable.
And I remember Stephen Hawking, who was then approaching... his third year as a research student, saying...
"What very interesting results.
I wonder whether they could be adapted... to understanding the origin of the universe."
And what he had in mind, you see, was that if, just mentally... you reverse the sense of time... you can think of the expanding universe as a collapsing system.
It's a bit like a very giant star collapsing.
Roger Penrose proved... that a dying star, collapsing under its own gravity... eventually shrinks to a singularity... a point of infinite density and zero size.
I realized that if I reversed the direction of time... so that the collapse became an expansion...
I could prove that... the universe had a beginning.
But my proof... based on Einstein's theory of general relativity... also showed that we cannot understand... how the universe began... because it showed that all scientific theories... including general relativity itself... break down at the beginning of the universe.
We had this meeting... at the Institute of Space Physics in New York.
I said, "Before we reach a final conclusion... we ought to throw into the pot... still another object... a gravitationally completely collapsed object.
Well, after you've used the phrase...
"a gravitationally completely collapsed object" ten times... you conclude you've got to get a better name.
So that's when I switched... to the word "black hole".
The word "black hole," which John Wheeler coined, suddenly caught on.
Everybody adopted it, and from then on... people around the world...
in Moscow... in America... in England and elsewhere... could know they were speaking about the same thing.
And not only that, but suddenly... the whole range of concepts got through to the general public... and even science-fiction writers all of a sudden... could talk about it.
Tonight, my friends... we stand on the brink of a feat unparalleled... in space exploration.
If the data on my returning probe ship... matches my computerized calculations...
I will travel where no man has dared to go.
Into the black hole?
In... through... and beyond.
Why, that's crazy!
Ha!
Impossible!
As a massive star contracts... its gravity becomes so strong... that light can no longer escape.
The region from which nothing can escape... is called a black hole... and its boundary is called the event horizon.
One might say of the event horizon... what Dante said of the entrance to hell...
"Abandon all hope, ye who enter here."
I was once asked to actually... be an adjudicator... on an essay of which the subject was...
"How to fall through a black hole and live."
Now, the problem I had was that I wouldn't know... how to give out the prize... because if I said, "That looks like a good essay"... the only real way of showing this was right... was to actually follow it, to do the experiment and fall in.
But then, having fallen in...
I would assume taking the person who wrote the essay with you... the question would be, how do you tell the rest of the world?
Do you take the prize in that you give to them... and what do they do with it when they get to the center?
Believe me...
I've been waiting a long time for someone like you... to record this moment.
Thank you, Doctor.
Then I'm ready.
Ready to embark on man's greatest journey.
Certainly his riskiest.
The risk is incidental compared to... the possibility to possess the great truth of the unknown.
There... long-cherished laws of nature... simply do not apply.
They vanish.
And life?
Life?
Life forever.
If you were watching an astronaut... foolhardy enough to jump into a black hole... at some time on his watch... say, 12:00... he would cross the event horizon... and enter the black hole.
But no matter how long you waited... you would never see the astronaut's watch reach 12:00.
Instead, each second on the watch... would appear to take longer and longer... until the last second before midnight... would take forever.
Thus, by jumping into a black hole... one could ensure that one's image lasted forever.
But the picture would fade very rapidly... and grow so dim that no one could see it.
As somebody disappears into a black hole... as seen from the outside, it looks as though... time actually slows down, and the person who's moving... at least he's thinking he's moving... he's perhaps talking in his spaceship at a normal rate... seems to slow down and ends up being frozen... in a particular position... as seen by somebody watching him from the outside.
And as seen from the outside, you never see what happens after that.
The astronaut wouldn't notice anything special... when his watch reached midnight... and he crossed the event horizon... into the black hole... until, of course, he approached the singularity... and was crushed into spaghetti.
One can fall through this event horizon... without feeling anything, without noticing it.
After about a week of falling, one begins to feel the pinch... and one extends longer and longer... and gets slightly thinner.
And, of course, one begins to get squeezed... until one gets very long and very thin... and rather nasty.
By the end of two weeks, one's fallen right into the center and is, of course, dead.
Before you lose sight of the outer world... you would see things happening and see them at a greater rate... so that it would look like a firework display.
The frustration would be that, although you would be able to see... everything that happens in the future, it would be going so fast... that from a scientific point of view, you'd have no time to analyze it.
You wouldn't be able to take it in.
Eventually things would be going off so fast... and it would be so explosive that you yourself would be... destroyed by the explosion, and that would be the end.
But it would be a very exciting way to end one's life.
It would be the way I would choose if I had the choice.
In the long history of the universe... many stars must have burned up their nuclear fuel... and collapsed in on themselves.
The number of black holes may be greater... than the number of visible stars... which totals about a hundred thousand million... in our galaxy alone.
We also have evidence... that there is a very large black hole... at the center of our own galaxy.
Friends ask me, "Well, if a black hole is black... how can you see it?"
And I say, "Have you ever been to a ball?
Have you ever watched the young men... dressed in their black evening tuxedos... and the girls in their white dresses... whirling around, held in each other's arms... and the lights turned low... and all you can see is the girls?
Well, the girl is the ordinary star... and the boy is the black hole.
You can't see the black hole any more than you can see the boy... but the girl going around gives you convincing evidence... there must be something there holding her in orbit."
One evening, shortly after the birth of my daughter, Lucy...
I started to think about black holes... as I was getting into bed.
My disability makes this rather a slow process... so I had plenty of time.
Suddenly I realized... that the area of the event horizon... must always increase with time.
The increase in the area of the event horizon... was very reminiscent of a quantity called entropy... which measures the degree of disorder of a system.
It is a matter of common experience... that disorder tends to increase with time... if things are left to themselves.
Jacob Bekenstein came into the office one day.
"Jacob," I said...
"It always troubles me... when I put a hot teacup next to a cold teacup.
I've increased, by letting heat flow from one to the other... the amount of disorder in the universe.
But Jacob, if a black hole swims by... and I drop both teacups into this...
I've concealed the evidence of my crime, have I not?"
Bekenstein's a man of great integrity... and he looked troubled, and he came back to me later... and he said, "No, you have not... concealed the evidence of your crime.
The black hole records what's happened to you."
Stephen Hawking read the paper... in which Bekenstein announced this result... thought it was preposterous... and decided to prove it was wrong.
My discoveries led Jacob Bekenstein to suggest... that the area of the event horizon... actually was the entropy of a black hole.
But there was one fatal flaw... in Bekenstein's idea:
If black holes have an entropy... they ought to have a temperature.
And if they have a temperature... they ought to give off radiation.
But how could they give off radiation... if nothing can escape from a black hole?
As it turned out...
Bekenstein was basically correct... though in a manner far more surprising... than he or anyone else had expected.
As he gradually lost the use of his hands... he had to start developing... carefully choosing research projects... that could be tackled and solved... through geometrical arguments that he could do pictorially in his head.
And he developed a very powerful set of tools nobody else really had.
So in some sense, when you lose one set of tools... you may develop other tools, but the new tools... are amenable to different kinds of problems than the old tools.
And if you're the only master in the world of these new tools... that means certain kinds of problems you can solve and nobody else can.
My work up to 1973... was in general relativity... and was summarized in a book I wrote with George Ellis called...
The Large Scale Structure of Space-Time.
Even then, it was difficult for me to write things down... so I tended to think in pictures and diagrams... that I could visualize in my head.
I remember visiting Stephen and Jane... at their home in Cambridge.
After supper in the evening... when it was time for Stephen to go to bed...
Jane insisted and Stephen acquiesced...
I guess this was standard... that Stephen make his way up...
I've forgotten whether it was one flight of stairs or two... alone... and this was a period when he could no longer walk.
The way he got up the stairs was, he grabbed hold of the pillars... that support the banister and pulled him up with the strength... pulled himself up the stairs with the strength of his own arms... dragging himself up... from the ground floor up to the second story... in a long, arduous effort.
Jane explained that... this was an important part of his physical therapy... to maintain his coordination... and strength as long as possible.
At first it was sort of heartrending... to watch what appeared to be the agony of pulling himself up the stairs... until I understood it's just part of life... pulling himself up the stairs like that.
General relativity is what is called... a classical theory.
It predicts a single definite path... for each particle.
But according to quantum mechanics... there is an element of chance or uncertainty.
A particle does not have... just a single path through space and time.
Instead, there is an uncertainty principle... according to which both the exact position... and velocity of a particle can never be known.
I began investigating... the effect quantum mechanics might have... on particles near a black hole.
I found that particles could escape... from a black hole... that black holes are not completely black.
At first I didn't believe it.
But when I redid the calculations...
I couldn't get the effect to go away.
I met Martin Rees, and he was shaking with excitement... and he said, "Have you heard?
Have you heard... what Stephen has discovered?
Everything is different!
Everything is changed!"
I was still unsure of my discovery... so I only told a few colleagues... but word soon spread.
Roger Penrose phoned up on my birthday.
He was very excited and went on so long... that my birthday dinner got quite cold.
It was a great pity, because it was goose... which I'm very fond of.
To me it's a miracle, 'cause it's a complicated and messy calculation.
We can now do these things very much better... and it's more transparent what happens.
But out of this messy calculation, he showed that black holes... aren't black with this quantum mechanical effect.
There was a residual radiation.
Stephen came to a meeting... and people were flabbergasted.
I remember someone saying, "You must be wrong, Stephen.
I don't believe a word of it."
I once said that I was unhappy... with the explanation given in terms of negative energy particles being created.
But I feel this is part of the controversy of science.
You must have the give and take, and I'm delighted to be a part of that.
That's what makes it fun.
If you all sat down and said, "Oh, lovely"... when you do have niggling questions in your mind... that's not doing a service to science.
But I was not antagonistic to it in any way... except for that one time when I questioned.
I finally convinced myself... that black holes radiate... when I found a mechanism through which this could happen.
According to quantum mechanics... space is filled with virtual particles... and antiparticles... that are constantly materializing in pairs... separating, coming together again... and annihilating each other.
In the presence of a black hole... one member of a pair of virtual particles... may fall into the hole... leaving the other member without a partner... with which to annihilate.
The forsaken particle appears to be radiation... emitted by the black hole.
And so black holes are not eternal.
They evaporate away at an increasing rate... until they vanish in a gigantic explosion.
Quantum mechanics has allowed particles and radiation... to escape from the ultimate prison... a black hole.
Einstein never accepted quantum mechanics... because of its element of chance and uncertainty.
He said, "God does not play dice."
It seems that Einstein was doubly wrong.
The quantum effects of black holes... suggest that not only does God play dice... he sometimes throws them... where they cannot be seen.
He says himself... that, uh... he wouldn't have got to where he is if he hadn't been ill.
And I think that's quite possible... because it's like Johnson said:
The knowledge you're to be hanged in the morning... concentrates the mind wonderfully.
And he has concentrated on this in a way...
I don't think he would have, because he took a great interest... in a lot of things in life... and I don't know that he'd have applied himself the same way... if he'd been able to get around as he used to do, so in a way...
No, I can't think anyone's lucky having an illness like that, even so.
But it's less bad luck for him than it would be for some people... because he can so much live in his head.
When I lived with the Hawking family, I would usually get up... around 7:15 or 7:30 and take a shower... and then read in my Bible some in the morning and pray... and then go down at 8:15 to get Stephen up.
And at breakfast I would often tell him what I'd been reading in the Bible... hoping that this would eventually have some influence.
So then we would go into work... and usually we'd go in and see if there were any scientific papers... that people sent out.
I did discover that despite Hawking's great brilliance, he does read quite slowly.
I could read about twice as fast as he.
But of course he would have to read to remember it... because it would be very difficult for him to go back and access the thing... whereas I could skim the paper rather quickly and see...
"Is there something interesting in this?"
If I wanted to work on it, I could pick the thing up and look at it.
Black hole radiation... has shown us that gravitational collapse... is not as final as we once thought.
If an astronaut falls into a black hole... he will be returned to the rest of the universe... in the form of radiation.
Thus, in a sense... the astronaut will be recycled.
However, it would be a poor sort of immortality... because any personal concept of time... would come to an end as he is torn apart... inside the black hole.
All that would survive... would be his mass, or energy.
One year, the Hawkings took me along... when we went to a cottage in Wales... near the River Wye... and this cottage was up a hill... and there was a bit of... a paved little sidewalk that went up to the cottage... which I had not been up, and of course...
I wanted to do it in the least number of trips I could imagine... so we put Stephen's batteries under his chair... his wheelchair has space for batteries...
and put extra batteries under there... which Stephen didn't realize that I'd put under there... so he didn't realize his wheelchair was as heavily laden.
Stephen got quite a bit ahead of me, and he was turning the corner... to go around to his house, but that was on a slope... so I looked up, and I noticed Stephen's wheelchair slowly tipping backward.
Of course, I was about ten meters away... and tried to run up there, but I was not able to get there... rapidly enough before he toppled backward into the bushes.
So it was a bit of a shocking sight... to see this master of gravity getting overcome... by the weak gravitational force of Earth.
One of the worst things for me would be having people there all the time.
Never alone.
I couldn't bear that.
And yet he finds things funny... and he enjoys life and he goes dashing about all over the place... and I think this is tremendous.
But it's a sort of courage I haven't got... and his father hadn't got it, and we cannot but admire it... but wonder how on earth he got it, really.
There must have been 50 people there... and I was standing off in a corner... sort of watching quietly... for a few minutes, relaxing... and Stephen was over there, not far from me.
Jane walked over to Stephen and looked at him.
He was sitting there with his head in his lap... like only Stephen can put his head in his lap.
And Jane said to Stephen...
"You look miserable, Stephen.
Sit up straight.
Some of your guests don't understand... that you're thinking about physics and having a wonderful time.
It looks like you're in pain.
Sit up and go talk to your guests."
In 1979...
I was elected Lucasian Professor of Mathematics.
This is the same chair once held by Isaac Newton.
They have a big book which every university teaching officer... is supposed to sign.
After I had been Lucasian Professor for about a year... they realized I had never signed.
So they brought the book to my office... and I signed with some difficulty.
That was the last time I signed my name.
My interest in the origin and fate of the universe... was reawakened when I attended... a conference on cosmology in the Vatican.
Afterwards, we were granted... an audience with the pope.
He told us that it was all right... to study the evolution of the universe... after the Big Bang... but we should not inquire into the Big Bang itself... because that was the moment of creation... and therefore the work of God.
I was glad that he did not know... the subject of the talk I had just given... the possibility that the universe had no beginning... no moment of creation.
There were theories in the early '70s...
the first type of creation theories... where the people concerned started off with a fixed, external space and time... which for eternity was empty... and then suddenly, for some unknown reason, the universe nucleates... at a particular point and then, bang, it blows apart.
But the trouble is that when space and time appear in the classical theory... that actual point itself is a singular point in the mathematics.
Mathematics breaks down, and so... you cannot use that to give you a creation theory.
If one goes back in time... one comes to the Big Bang singularity... where the laws of physics break down.
But there's another direction of time... that one can go in which avoids the singularity.
This is called the imaginary direction of time.
In imaginary time... there need not be any singularities... which form a beginning or end to time.
When you come to imaginary time, you have this rather peculiar possibility... of having a "now," as it were... without necessarily having a sort of a chain... of past moments.
If we start where we are at the moment and start running backwards in time... then for a long time, things work perfectly normally.
But as you begin to get further and further back towards... what would be the origin point in the conventional real-time picture... you'd find that the nature of time changes... that the imaginary component becomes more and more prominent... until what ought to have been the singular point in the classical theory... gets smoothed away, and you have this beautiful picture... of these bowls where the creation of the universe is pictures... of where we are now, and a smooth bowl of the past... where there's no initial point, just a sort of smooth shape.
So long as the universe had a beginning... we could suppose it had a creator.
But if the universe is completely self-contained... having no boundary or edge... it would neither be created nor destroyed.
It would simply be.
What place, then, for a creator?
All you can really say is that the universe is... because it's a self-consistent mathematical structure.
There's no past because, unlike the creation-as-a-point scenario... there's nothing for it to be created in.
So to say it's created from nothing is a bit of a misnomer.
It's a misleading use of the word "nothing".
It's not just that there was empty space in which the universe appeared, which you might call "nothing".
There was really nothing at all, because there wasn't even a creation event.
The use of a past tense in a verb becomes inappropriate in these theories.
Unfortunately, tenses were set up when people believed in real time, of course... and we don't yet have a linguistic form to describe tenses in imaginary time.
The word "time" was not handed down from heaven... as a gift from on high.
The idea of time is a word... invented by man... and if it has puzzlements connected with it... whose fault is it?
It's our fault.
Where does the difference... between the past and the future come from?
The laws of science do not distinguish... between the past and the future.
Yet there is a big difference... between the past and future in ordinary life.
You may see a cup of tea fall off a table... and break into pieces on the floor... but you will never see the cup gather itself back together... and jump back on the table.
The increase of disorder, or entropy... is what distinguishes the past from the future... giving a direction to time.
He fell ill in Switzerland.
When he came back, he was on a ventilator.
Because he's on a ventilator, you've got a tube down your throat... and therefore you can't speak, just for that reason.
For that period, which may have been a couple of months...
I spent probably one in two nights, one in three nights, at the hospital... because when he was in hospital... he couldn't communicate with the nurses.
It's not just like being seriously ill... but you're in a position where the nurses couldn't understand what Stephen wanted.
If Stephen was uncomfortable, they couldn't tell why.
Before I caught pneumonia... my speech had been getting more slurred... so that only a few people who knew me well... could understand me.
But at least I could communicate.
I wrote scientific papers... by dictating to a secretary... and I gave seminars through an interpreter.
And then, a tracheostomy operation... removed my ability to speak altogether.
After a long time...
well, it seemed like a long time... somebody came up with this brilliant gadget.
They didn't have it at the Cambridge hospital.
They got it from somewhere in London.
This was high technology... how you can communicate with a person with no voice.
It's a plastic piece of Perspex about so big... and you've got the letters of the alphabet arranged like that, and a hole in the middle.
You hold it up between you and the other person.
They look at a letter, and you can see which letter they're looking at... most of the time.
Sometimes you can't be sure.
So you would get the patient to spell out what they wanted.
So each letter...
they have to look to pick out the A.
You say, "A?" Did you get it right?
It's like a guessing game.
Stephen wasn't willing to accept that he wasn't going to speak again... and he thought he would be giving in... by trying to find a method of communicating other than speech.
I remember I went in one evening... and this was the first time that he asked... to be gotten out of bed to use the computer.
Sometimes they'd sit him up so he wasn't lying in bed all the time... as you do with a patient, but this time when I turned up... he asked the nurse, could he be gotten out of bed... so he could use the computer, and he did.
I remember the first thing he typed on there after saying hello...
Stephen's always very polite about things like that... was, "Will you help me finish my book?"
A computer expert in California... heard of my plight... and sent me a computer program... called Equalizer.
This allowed me to select words... from a series of menus on a screen... by pressing a switch in my hand.
These words could then be sent to a speech synthesizer... attached to my wheelchair.
Much to my surprise...
I found I was able to communicate... much better than before.
When eventually he went home from hospital... he was told he needed 24-hour nursing, and everyone was saying...
"How is he going to go in and do work?
Is he going to trail around with nurses after him in the office?"
And of course he did.
They talked originally of him working at home... which he wasn't happy with.
And so, after a period of recuperation at home... he just decided to go back into the office.
And he'd make the trip from his house to the office... which is, I don't know, half a mile in his wheelchair... with a nurse walking along with him.
This is at the time when he was still driving around... with the bag and the nasal drip... going into the department, working, going back home.
I began to wonder what would happen... when the universe stopped expanding... and began to contract.
Would we see broken cups... gather themselves together off the floor... and jump back onto the table?
Would we be able to remember tomorrow's prices... and make a fortune off the stock market?
It seemed to me... the universe had to return to a smooth and ordered state... when it recollapsed.
If this were so, time would go backwards... when the universe began to collapse.
People in the contracting phase would live their lives backward.
They would die before they were born... and get younger as the universe got small again.
Eventually, they would return to the womb.
He gave me my first problem to do.
He asked me to look at this mathematical problem.
Usually when he gives a problem, he has a good idea... of what the answer should be.
I went to look at it, and it took me a few months... to understand what it was about, and I came back and said, "I get this answer."
And he said to me, "No, that is not what I expected."
I said, "That's what I get." So I went to the blackboard, explained what it was.
He said, "Did you think about that particular case?" I said, "No, I didn't."
So I went back... and I calculated what he'd talked to me about.
I came back a few weeks after, and I said, "Stephen, I don't get this thing.
I still get the same answer I had originally."
So he said to me, "No, no, no, no.
This doesn't work.
Did you think about that?"
I said, "Oh, no.
I'd forgotten about that particular case."
So I went back to the drawing board and started calculating again... and again I got the same answer.
So I went back to see Stephen, and this dragged on for two or three months.
Finally he said to me...
"Maybe one of your approximations is not valid."
So me and a colleague decided to do the thing with computers.
This takes a lot of time to write the programs... and to be sure the program was correct.
We get the answer, and it was still the way I'd said before... and not the way Stephen said, so we went to see Stephen and said, "See?
Again."
I had made a mistake.
I had been using too simple a model of the universe.
Time will not reverse direction... when the universe begins to contract.
People will continue to get older... so it is no good waiting until the universe recollapses... to return to our youth.
Einstein once asked the question...
"How much choice did God have... in constructing the universe?"
If my proposal that the universe has no boundary is correct... he had no freedom at all... to choose how the universe began.
He would only have had the freedom... to choose the laws the universe obeyed.
This, however, may not have been... all that much of a choice.
There may well be only one unified theory... that allows for the existence of structures... as complicated as human beings... who can investigate the laws of the universe... and ask about the nature of God.
I don't know how clear-cut these experiments are... but there are experiments that have been done on the timing of consciousness... and they seem to lead to a very odd picture... which doesn't even quite make consistent sense.
Whether refinement of these experiments... might get rid of this kind of anomaly I'm not sure... but it does look a little as though there is something very odd about consciousness... and somehow almost as though the future affects the past in some way... over a very tiny, limited scale, but something maybe of the order... of a reasonable fraction of a second.
And there's no reason to believe... that one's conscious experience... shouldn't be part of somebody else's... at some other stage.
I don't know if it's fair to say what happens after one dies... but it's a plausible picture... that you could be somebody else... and that somebody else could be somebody that lived in the past, not in the future.
Even if there is only one possible unified theory... that is just a set of rules and equations... what is it that breathes fire into the equations... and makes a universe for them to describe?
Why does the universe go to all the bother of existing?
Is the unified theory so compelling... that it brings about its own existence?
Or does it need a creator?
And, if so... who created him?
I think I would say that the universe has a purpose.
It's not somehow just there by chance.
I think it's...
Yeah.
So... it's... it's...
Some people, I think, take the view that the universe is just there... and it sort of runs and runs, and it just sort of computes... and we happen somehow by accident to find ourselves in this thing.
But I don't think that's a very fruitful... or helpful way of looking at the universe.
I think that there is something much deeper about it.
In real time, the time in which we live... the universe has two possible destinies:
It may continue to expand forever... or it may recollapse and come to an end... at the Big Crunch.
It would be rather like the Big Bang... but in reverse.
I now believe that the universe will come to an end... at the Big Crunch.
I do, however, have certain advantages... over many other prophets of doom.
Whatever happens ten billion years from now...
I don't expect to be around to be proved wrong.
Of all the pictures that I know... the simplest of any cosmology... is that in which the universe is closed... has a finite lifetime... and collapses with the same kind of collapse... that a black hole does.
If it should turn out that indeed... the universe is limited in its life... how is that different from the life... of each one of us?
On the evening of Tuesday, March 5th... at about 10:45...
I was returning to my flat in Pinehurst.
It was dark and raining.
I came up to Grange Road... and saw headlights approaching... but judged that they were far enough away... that I could cross safely.
The vehicle must have been traveling very fast... for when I got just past the middle of the road... my nurse screamed, "Look out!"
I heard tires skidding... and my wheelchair was struck a tremendous blow in the back.
I ended up in the road... with my legs over the remains of the wheelchair.
The accident destroyed my wheelchair... and damaged my computer system... with which I communicate.
I required 13 stitches in my head... but I was able to go back to work several days later.
The memories I have are very much... kind of... visual pictures of what Stephen was... of seeing Stephen in certain situations.
He was always moving.
Always.
Well, hardly ever still.
It was the same thing about his face and gesture... which he used a great deal, I should say... but it's only memory.
I found some photographs recently... which reminded me of the general look of everybody... and I must say Stephen looked very much like he does now... if one thinks of him like that.
He does believe very intensely... in the almost infinite possibility of the human mind.
You have to find out what you can't know... before you know you can't, don't you?
So I don't think that thought should be restricted at all.
Why shouldn't you go on thinking about the unthinkable?
Somebody's got to start sometime.
Think how many things were unthinkable a century ago... and yet people have thought them.
And often they also seemed quite unpractical.
Not all the things Stephen says probably... are to be taken as gospel truth.
He's a searcher.
He's looking for things.
And sometimes he probably talks nonsense.
Well, don't we all?
But the point is... people must think.
People must go on thinking.
They must try to extend the boundaries of knowledge... and they don't sometimes even know where to start.
You don't know where the boundaries are, do you?
You don't know what your taking-off point is.
If we do discover a complete theory of the universe... it should in time be understandable... in broad principle by everyone... not just a few scientists.
Then we shall all... philosophers, scientists, and just ordinary people... be able to take part in the discussion of why it is... that we and the universe exist.
If we find the answer to that... it would be the ultimate triumph... of human reason... for then we would know... the mind of God.
Because I couldn't get my shadow to stick.
Besides, I wasn't crying.
I shall sew it on for you, my little man.
I shall sew it on for you, my little man.
It may hurt a little.
What's your name?
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.
-What's yours?
-Peter Pan.
Watch your daughter.
She's wonderful.
She's stealing the show.
I think it's perfectly sweet of you.
Louder!
I think it's perfectly sweet of you.
I shall give you a kiss if you like.
Don't you know what a kiss is?
I shall, once you give one to me.
Now I shall give you a kiss.
I don't ever wanna become a man.
I always wanna be a little boy and have fun.
We wanna be like Peter Pan We don't wanna grow up
Brad.
Yeah, I'm at my daughter's play.
It's impossible.
I'm on a plane to London tomorrow night with my family.
A children's hospital is dedicating an entire wing to Granny Wendy.
Brad....
Peter, you're missing it.
All right.
I want a meeting, tomorrow a.m.
Dad, my game!
You promised.
Listen, it's my son's big game.
Last game of the season.
Santa Series.
I gotta be there.
I promised.
We'll make it short.
I'll be there.
My word is my bond.
We never, never, never Never, never, never, never
Never, never, ever wanna grow up
Strike three!
You're out.
Bluejays, come on!
Jack!
Come on, Bluejays!
Bluejays!
Fire it up!
Where is your father?
He's missing it.
Daddy'll be here.
He promised.
Jerry?
Jack?
-Jim.
-I said that.
Go to the game ahead of me.
Film what I miss.
This is the speech for your grandmother's tribute.
-On cards?
-Yes.
-Number those.
Who wrote it?
-Ned Miller.
I loved his annual report.
Read it.
" For the past 70 years, the Granny Wendy we honour tonight has given hope and care and life to hundreds of orphans."
Great.
Mommy, where's Daddy?
My briefcase.
Gotta fly.
Don't worry.
More people crash in cars.
It's a lot safer to fly than crossing the street.
If it's your time to go, it's your time to go.
And remember, don't let your arms get tired!
What if it's the pilot's time to go?
Come on, keep us alive, Banning!
Keep us alive!
Okay, come on!
Hi, Mrs. Banning.
I'm from the office.
Which one's your son?
-He's up to bat!
-Thank you!
Come on, Jack!
Come on, pal!
Come on, Jack!
Don't look at me!
Focus!
Stay focused!
Come on, Jack.
One time, Jack.
Come on, Jack!
Come on, Jack!
Please, not a curve ball.
Mama wants a new pair of shoes.
Drive me home, Jack!
That's the game!
Yeah, Brad, that's real good.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, your captain again.
Please do not allow this minor turbulence to disturb you.
For now, please sit back, relax.
Enjoy the remainder of the flight.
Thank you.
Look what Jack drew!
That's very nice, dear.
What's that?
Fire.
Fire!
Really?
Is that our plane?
Who are these people?
That's Jack, that's me, that's Mom and that's you.
Where's my parachute?
-I won't make it to my birthday.
-You won't die without a phone.
I got the phone in the briefcase.
Talk to him.
Why didn't I have a parachute, Jackie?
Take a wild guess.
-Jackie!
-Jack.
Will you stop?
You can break a window.
They're layered.
You can't break them.
Give me that.
You're afraid you'll get sucked out.
I'm not afraid.
Yes, you are.
You're afraid you'll be sucked out.
Just stop.
Jack, next season, I'm coming to six games.
I promise.
Yeah, be sure to buy enough videotape.
My word is my bond.
Yeah, junk bond!
When are you gonna stop acting like a child?
I am a child.
Grow up.
It's been a long time.
Let's have fun, Peter.
London's a magical place for children.
-It was for us.
-And expensive.
Jack, don't do that.
You could put someone's eye out.
Maggie.
Maggie.
Peter, it's number 1 4.
Sorry.
What do you say to Granny Wendy?
-" How do you do?"
-Jack, get down!
Be careful.
Is Granny Wendy the real, real Wendy from my play?
No, not really.
Sort of.
Don't be a sloucher.
Take that gum out of your mouth.
It's time to look our best.
First impressions are the most important.
Shoes tied.
Shirt tucked.
You know this.
Remember, you're in England, land of good manners.
Uncle Tootles.
It's snowing!
Look at these adorable children!
It's good to see you, Libby-
- Linda-
- Lisa--
-Liza.
-I said that.
Oh, Moira, how are you?
You look wonderful!
Oh, my God!
Look at the size--
Look at you!
Such a sweet thing!
-Granny Wendy will be right down.
-She's upstairs?
Oh, good.
-Big boy!
You could play rugby.
-No, baseball.
Oh, look.
-Did you do this for us?
-We've been cooking all week.
You've been cooking?
What've you been cooking?
Mince pies?
Peter, look at this.
Look at this.
-Who's that?
-It's you.
Was I ever that young?
-What's gotten into you?
-This house has gotten to me.
Some of those things I was when I was young have never left me.
Oh, thank God!
We were children in these rooms.
Lost, lost, lost.
Lost what?
I've lost my marbles.
Lisa?
Liza.
-He was supposed to be in a home.
-It broke Wendy's heart.
Tootles is Wendy's first orphan.
Which is which?
Large bag's mine, and the smaller ones are the children's.
Hello, boy.
Hello, Wendy.
I told you, Gran, I'd get him here, by hook or by crook.
I'm sorry it's been so long between visits.
It's been 1 0 years between visits.
But never mind.
Come and give me a skwoodge.
Oh, Moira, Moira, Moira!
Who is this lovely lady?
It can't be Maggie.
Yes, it can.
And know what?
I just played you at school.
And don't you just look the part.
Can this giant be Jack?
How much you've grown in a year!
I'm supposed to tell you about congratulations for opening the orphan hospital and how great the dedication is.
-Thank you so very much.
-Welcome.
Now, there is one rule I insist be obeyed while you are in my house:
No growing up.
Stop this very instant.
And that includes you, Mr. Chairman-of-the-Board Banning.
Sorry, too late, Gran.
And what's so terribly important about your terribly important business?
You see, when a big company's in trouble Dad sails in, and if there's any resistance--
He's exaggerating.
I'm still into mergers and acquisitions.
And I'm dabbling in some land development.
Any resistance and he blows them out of the water.
So!
Peter, you've become a pirate!
Brad's on the line.
He says it's urgent!
Do you like my dress?
Great, Gran.
Thanks.
Hey, Brad.
Good news?
What?
What Sierra Club report?
I thought we had these guys.
He's trying to suck my blood!
He drools all over my neck.
What did they find?
-That's a portable phone--
-A Cozy Blue Owl?
Well, listen.
Ask them if anybody misses the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Oh, well, I do!
Boy, do I ever!
Wow, you kidding?
Wait a minute.
You telling me a 1 0-inch owl has a 50-mile mating radius?
Why don't they just fornicate someplace else?
You're telling me a 5-billion-dollar deal is falling apart because of this?
Somebody shoot me in the head!
Bang!
Bang!
Will everybody just shut up!
I'm sorry.
Leave me alone for one moment!
Get them out of here!
I'm on the phone call of my life!
Come on, Jack.
Out, out, out.
Come with me.
I'll show you the window where your dad and I used to blow out the stars.
I should've stayed till the deal was done.
Granny asked you to visit every year.
I've been busy.
You promised the children some real time here.
You haven't looked at them once.
-That's not true.
-How many more broken promises?
It's Brad, Moira.
I gotta take this call.
I gotta fix this.
No, you gotta fix your family first.
Peter, hello?
Are you there?
What...?
-I'm sorry about your deal.
-You hated the deal.
I hated the deal.
But I'm sorry you feel so badly about it.
Your children love you.
They want to play with you.
How long do you think that lasts?
Soon Jack may not even want you to come to his games.
We have a few special years with our children when they're the ones that want us around.
Then you'll be running after them for a bit of attention.
It's so fast, Peter.
It's a few years, then it's over.
And you are not being careful.
And you are missing it.
Peter, where are you?
Peter!
Peter!
Peter!
"All children, except one, grow up."
Now, you know where faeries come from, don't you, Maggie?
"When the first baby laughed for the first time the laugh broke into a thousand pieces and they all went skipping about.
That was the beginning of faeries."
And look.
I'm Wendy.
Or was, a long time ago.
But Jack says you're not the really " real" Wendy.
Do you see where Jack is?
Well, that's the same window.
And this is the same room where we made up stories about Peter, Never Land and scary old Captain Hook.
And do you know, Mr. Barrie, well, Sir James, our neighbour loved our stories so much that he wrote them all down in a book.
Oh, dear me, 80 years ago.
You're really old!
That's very true.
I'm sorry to break this up.
I have to steal Granny or she'll be late for the most important event of her life.
Oh, dear.
Daddy, I made something for you.
You're gonna love this.
It's a hug.
Next time you fly, you won't have to be scared.
She's made you a parachute.
That's very clever, dear.
Get away from there!
What have I told you about playing near open windows?
Keep this window closed.
Do we have open windows at home?
No.
They've all got bars on them.
Come on.
Into bed.
Who took my baseball?
That mean, scary man at the window stole it.
There's no scary man.
But he says he's a window washer.
What's this?
A baseball glove.
You can catch things with it take hot things out of the oven, hit your sister with it.
Tootles made it for me.
It smells nice.
It's paper, honey.
Hey, Jack.
Faker.
You're in charge now.
This is my very special watch, so you can keep track of the time.
Don't go out, Mom.
Please.
Good night.
Dear night-lights, protect my sleeping babes.
Burn clear and steadfast tonight.
I read recently that they're now using lawyers instead of rats for experiments.
They do this for two reasons:
One, the scientists become less attached to the lawyers.
And two, there are certain things that even rats won't do.
I thank the Board of Trustees of the Ormond Street Hospital for having me here this evening and beg your forgiveness because normally I address shareholders.
We don't know each other, and I doubt that we have very much in common except this wonderful woman, Wendy Angela Darling.
Granny Wendy brought me in from the cold.
She taught me to read and write.
She even found people to be my parents and adopt me.
She's loved so many children just so efforlete-- efforse-- effortlessly.
That's her achievement.
Many of you here tonight were once lost children but Granny Wendy found parents and homes for each of you and saved you.
That's her miracle.
I know that if you could stand now, you would express much better than I have your feelings of gratitude appreciation and warm feelings for this wonderful woman.
I guess we do have something in common.
We're orphans.
Hook!
Hook.
Jack....
You all right?
Wendy?
Thank you, Nigel.
Norman?
Neville, sir.
Is that English?
Merry Christmas.
I was proud of you.
It was a beautiful speech.
Yes, it was.
Liza?
Tootles?
My God!
The children!
Jack!
Answer me!
Maggie!
The wind came up.
The door closed on me and the children were screaming!
The children were screaming!
The window.
" Dear Peter:
Your presence is required at the request of your children.
Kindest personal regards J.A.S. Hook Captain."
Have to fly.
Have to fight.
Have to crow.
Have to save Maggie.
Have to save Jack.
Hook is back.
Who?
Gran!
Well, the lab boys can analyse this little lot.
We've wired the phones, and two of my lads will be outside at all times.
It's possible that this is some kind of ridiculous prank.
My children are missing.
Yes, but the literary history of the family suggests....
Let's hope--
I've forgotten how to fly.
Yeah, well, one does.
Good night, ma'am.
Good night, sir.
No more happy thoughts.
Lost!
Lost!
-The police will do everything they can.
-The police can do nothing.
Really?
Maybe we should call the American police.
In a crisis, we English always make a cup of tea.
Moira, would you?
Yes, of course.
Don't forget to warm the pot.
I'll go.
You stay.
Don't worry, Gran Wendy, I wasn't gonna leave.
Hand me my book, please.
It's time to tell you, at last.
Tell me what?
How far back can you remember, Peter?
I remember the hospital on Great Ormond Street.
You worked with orphans.
You arranged for the adoption by my American parents.
You were 1 2, nearly 1 3.
I mean, before that.
There's nothing before that.
Try, Peter.
Do try.
Nothing.
You know, when I was young no other girl held your favour the way I did.
I expected you to alight on the church and forbid my vows on my wedding day.
I wore a pink satin sash.
But you didn't come.
Grandma?
Yes, I was an old lady when I wrapped you in blankets.
A grandmother.
With my 1 3-year-old granddaughter asleep in the bed.
Moira.
And when you saw her that was when you decided not to go back to Never Land.
Where?
To Never Never Land.
-I'll get Moira.
-I've tried to tell you--
-Maybe the tea's ready.
-I knew you'd forgotten!
I'm not ready to deal with this now.
The stories are true.
I swear to you.
I swear on everything I adore.
And now he's come back to seek his revenge.
The fight isn't over for Captain James Hook.
He wants you back.
He knows you'll follow Maggie and Jack to the ends of the earth.
And, by heaven, you must find a way.
Only you can save your children.
Somehow, you must go back.
You must make yourself remember.
Remember what?
Peter, don't you know who you are?
Yes, boy.
Yes.
Sorry.
Parachute....
Firefly from hell!
Big damn bug!
It is you!
It is!
A big you!
It's not bad you're big.
You were always big.
Maybe this means you'll be twice as much fun.
What fun we'll have again!
What times!
What great games!
You're a little....
Faerie.
Pixie.
If less is more, there's no end to me, Peter Pan.
-Peter Banning.
-Pan.
-Banning.
-Pan.
Whoever you are, it's still you.
Because only one person has that smell.
Smell?
The smell of someone who's ridden the wind.
The smell of sleeping in trees.
Adventures with Indians and pirates.
Remember?
The world was ours!
We could do everything or nothing.
I had to be anything because it was always us.
It's happened.
I'm having a nervous breakdown.
Follow me and all will be well.
I'm dying.
Heading towards the white light.
I've left my body.
There's my house down there.
There are my feet.
-Where are we going?
-To save your children!
-How do you know about my kids?
-Everybody knows!
Hook's got them and you've gotta fight him!
Let's fly!
It is true, then.
You did grow up.
I drank poison for you.
You used to call me "Tink."
-Have you forgotten everything?
-Are you in there, bug?
I'm not a bug.
I'm a faerie.
I do not believe in faeries.
Anytime someone says, " I do not believe in faeries," a faerie falls down dead.
I do not believe in faeries!
!
My God, I think I killed it.
Are you alive, little bug?
Look out!
Clap your hands, Peter.
It's the only way to save me.
Clap....
Louder.
Louder, Peter!
I'm clapping!
Oh, God, you're alive!
All right.
Now, who am I?
You're a Freudian hallucination of my mother.
I don't know why you have wings, but you have lovely legs.
What am I saying?
I'm an orphan.
I've never taken drugs.
I missed the '60s.
I was an accountant.
Guess again!
Look, stars!
That's right, Peter.
Second star to the right and straight on till morning.
Never Land!
What a nightmare!
Roll out!
Roll out!
Lovely fish!
Fresh fish!
We keep the eyes in so they'll see you through the week!
Excuse me.
Is there a pay phone around here?
That is so real.
Peter, get back here!
Get down!
Get low!
Hide!
If it ain't the Mother Inferior.
Gentlemen, I'm looking for someone.
I fancy them shiny shoes for my booties.
I think you can get them at Armani.
Tink!
Tink!
Help!
Don't get no blood on them boots!
They's mine!
Help me!
Tinkerbell!
You pixie devil!
Please don't!
I have a bad back!
You pixie devil!
Are you related to Mighty Mouse?
If you insist on seeing Hook do exactly what I say.
Your left arm is dead and hangs lifeless at your side.
Lean on the crutch!
Left foot turned in.
Tilt your head and glare with your good eye!
Now crack your mouth and drool.
Now growl!
Growl!
-How are you?
-Not bad, and you?
Not bad!
Put your faces on, girls.
Here comes Smee!
Follow that Hook!
Make way for the Hook!
Me mother loves that Hook!
Give us the Hook!
Give us the Hook!
Good morning, Never Land!
Good morning, Mr. Smee!
Tie down the main mast, mateys.
Because here he is!
The cunning kingfish!
The brave barracuda!
A man so deep, he's almost unfathomable.
A man so quick, he's even fast asleep!
Thank you!
Let's give him a very big hand because he's only got one.
I give you the steel-handed stingray Captain James Hook!
Hook!
Hook!
Hook!
Hook...!
See how greatly the men favour you, sir?
The pealing spawn.
How I despise them!
Go get 'em, captain!
Thank you!
Well, my stupid, sorry, parasitic sacks of entrails....
Revenge is mine.
Long live the Hook!
I baited that Hook and now I'm proud to announce we have his children.
My God!
Jack and Maggie.
Finally I'm going to kill Peter Pan that cocky boy who cut off my hand and fed it to the crocodile!
And who killed that cunning crocodile?
Who stuffed him?
Who made him into a quiet clock?
Who went to the other world and stole Pan's children?
And who didn't believe I could do it?
Who doubted me?
Who amongst us does not belong?
Someone here does not belong.
Stranger amongst the loyal, I'll weed you out.
You!
You!
Where's the carpet, Smee?
Sorry, sir.
You!
You!
That's right, you!
No, not you!
Not you.
You.
You!
You bet against me bringing Pan back here, didn't you?
Tell your captain the truth.
Say it.
Say it.
I did.
-You made a boo-boo.
-I did.
-The Boo Box.
-Not the Boo Box!
Boo!
Put me down!
I want my mommy!
I want my daddy!
Hello, children.
Comfy?
Cozy?
Those are my kids!
Those are my kids!
Everything's gonna be all right.
It's all right.
Daddy's here.
I want those kids out of that net or you better get an attorney.
Who are you?
I'm Peter Banning.
I want my children.
Those are your...?
These are your children?
And you're...?
You're Peter?
You're Peter?
No!
-You're Peter?
-Is there an echo in here?
Yes!
My great and worthy opponent?
Who is this impostor?
Peter flogging flying Pan!
I'm not Peter Pan.
I am just an ordinary....
I've got a sworn affidavit by a T. Bell.
I've got his medical history.
I even got his dental records.
Are you trying to do me out of my job?
May I show you something?
Will you let go?
Release him.
-May I show you this?
-Will you shut him up.
-Captain, put these on.
-I want to see the scar.
The hypertrophy.
Here's where you sliced him during the Tiger Lily incident.
That's my appendix!
What's this?
Faerie footprints.
He's Peter Pan or I've got a dead man's dinghy.
Is it you?
My great and worthy opponent?
But it can't be.
Not this pitiful, spineless, pasty, bloated codfish I see before me.
You're not even a shadow of Peter Pan.
You have an obligation to clarify this Pan problem.
This disaster.
-Which must be remedied.
-Expediently.
I want my children.
The stakes can be no higher.
For me, sir, they could have sunk no lower.
And I want my war!
Blow him out of the water!
Daddy's handling this.
It's okay.
Pick up your weapon.
How much?
Hoist and raise the kiddies!
I'll make you a deal, Mr. Chairman.
Fly up there and touch the fingers of your children, and I'll set them free.
I can't fly.
Explode out of there!
Stop this charade!
Free your children!
I beg your pardon?
You must be joking.
Peter Pan has a real problem with heights.
I'm not Peter Pan.
It's okay.
Hang on, son.
I'm coming, sweetheart.
-Somebody give me a hand.
-I already have.
Save us, Daddy!
"Save me, Daddy!"
We know who you are!
What new game is this, Peter?
Fly!
Stop pretending!
Fly!
I know it's you!
Be the Pan you are.
Fly!
Fly!
Think a happy thought.
Just touch our fingers and we'll be able to go home.
Touch them, Peter, and it's all been just a bad dream!
Just reach out and touch them!
Flap your arm and fly!
Reach!
Come on, Daddy.
Mommy could do it.
I don't understand.
Why doesn't he fly?
He's a fop Peter Pan!
He's Peter Pan, all right, captain.
He's been away from Never Land so long, his mind's been gentrified.
He's forgotten everything.
Please don't give up.
I want to go home.
Gentlemen, I'm afraid I have decided to cancel the war.
He can't fly, but he can swim!
Kill them.
Kill them all.
Bring on the plank!
And I never want to hear the name Peter Pan again!
What about the name Hook?
Do you want to be remembered as a bully?
Or as the great warrior who defeated a heroic Pan?
One week and I'll get him in shape, and you can have your dirty old war.
It's a trick, captain!
Let me blast that buzzing vixen to pixie hell!
You promised people the war of the century.
Your whole life has been building to this.
Mortal combat, glory!
Hook versus Pan!
That is not Pan.
Two days.
Four.
Bare minimum for a decent Pan.
Three.
Final offer.
Done.
And you'd better deliver, Miss Bell or no amount of clapping will bring you back from where I will send you.
Hear me, men.
I've decided that the so-called Pan will return in three days to commence the arbitrament of the sword.
Smee, translate.
In three days we'll have a war.
A battle between good and evil, to the death.
Help me!
Snow!
What...?
What?
Help!
Get me down!
Oh, you're alive!
Oh, get me down!
I believe!
Lost Boys!
Lost Boys!
Wake up!
Pan's back!
Lost Boys!
Lost Boys!
Wake up!
That was my pillow!
I'm up.
Wake up, you sleepyheads!
Pan's back!
Pan's back!
Pan!
Pan!
Who's the shrub?
Bangerang!
That ain't Peter Pan.
He's old.
He's fat!
Not so fat to me.
He's an old, fat grandpa man.
Rufio!
That is so dangerous.
That's enough!
Okay, mister.
All right.
The show's over.
Put that thing away!
Put it down before you poke somebody's eye out.
You're not old enough to shave.
What are you doing with that sword?
This is an insurance nightmare!
What's this?
Lord of the Flies preschool?
Where are your parents?
Who's in charge here?
No, Mr. Skunkhead-with-too-much-mousse, you're just a punk kid.
I want to speak to a grownup!
All grownups are pirates!
Excuse me?
We kill pirates.
I'm not a pirate.
It so happens I am a lawyer.
Kill the lawyer!
I'm not that kind of lawyer.
I've been shot!
Help!
Help me, somebody!
Boys, listen!
He married Wendy's granddaughter!
Hook's kidnapped his kids.
He's just out of shape.
We have to make him bangerang!
No, no!
Please stop!
Why are you doing this to me?
Rufio, you're the best with a sword.
Please teach him.
We gotta make him remember.
Excuse me.
Help me!
Not you!
Oh, my!
A wall.
Lost Boys, stop!
Stop it!
Play!
Play.
You're dead, jolly man.
He can't do those things.
He can't even play simple games.
Hook has got his kids, and I've got three days to get him ready to fight.
And I need everybody's help.
Peter Pan's got kids?
He can't fly, fight or crow.
If any of you says this here scug ain't Peter Pan cross the line.
What?
I'll be right back.
What?
You are embarrassing me!
Oh, there you are, Peter!
But, Peter you've grown up.
You promised never to grow old.
His nose got real big.
Well, welcome back to Never Land, Pan the Man.
Don't listen to that faerie and that brainless fungus!
I got Pan's sword!
I'm the Pan now!
You think this guy's gonna take it from me?
Rufio?
Wait!
If Tink believes, maybe he is.
Are you gonna follow this drooler against Capitan Hook?
What's he doing here if he's not Peter Pan, huh?
He don't look happy here.
And who are them kids Hook's got?
Give him a chance!
Those are my kids, and Hook's gonna kill them unless we do something.
Help me.
Please.
Yeah, come on!
Give him a chance!
Well, I should claw myself with my own hook.
Not to kill Pan when I had the chance!
What have I done?
What have I done, Smee?
Agreed to a preposterous plan, an absurd war.
Now I'm bound by my indefatigable good form to wait.
-I'll fix you a nice plate.
-Wait for what?
Whether it be three days or three decades, he'll always be a fat, old Pan.
I hate being disappointed, Smee.
And I hate living in this flawed body!
And I hate living in Never Land!
And I hate, I hate I hate Peter Pan!
Smee?
Smee?
I've just had a sublime vision.
All the jagged parts of my life have come together to form a complete and mystical whole.
An epiphany.
A " piphy" what?
My life is over.
You've lost your appetite?
Yes.
Goodbye.
Where're you going?
Are you getting dramatic?
Goodbye, Smee.
Captain, why don't we play with your island?
All the little lndians and the soldiers and all the Lost Boys?
Here we go.
No stopping me this time, Smee.
This is it.
Don't make a move, Smee.
Not a step.
My finger's on the trigger.
Don't try to stop me, Smee.
Oh, not again.
This is it.
Don't try to stop me this time, Smee.
Don't try to stop me this time, Smee.
Don't you dare try to stop me this time, Smee.
Try to stop me.
You better get up off your ass.
Get over here!
-I'm coming!
-Stop me!
This is not a joke!
I'm committing suicide!
Don't ever frighten me like that again.
-Sorry.
-What are you, a sadist?
I'm sorry.
How do you feel now?
-I want to die.
-Oh, now, now.
-There's no adventure here.
-You call this " no adventure"?
Death is the only great adventure I have left.
Let's get you into bed.
It's all over.
-I'm so tired.
-Don't upset yourself, captain.
My career is over.
This was supposed to be the war to end all wars.
-And it will be, captain.
-The ultimate war.
There must be a way to get at him, to get even with him to get him where it really would hurt.
There must be something I haven't thought of.
Where is he vulnerable?
No more talk about doing away with yourself.
I mean, what would the world be like without Captain Hook?
Indeed.
Good form, Smee.
-What would the world be like without me?
-There you go.
I'm ready for my nightcap.
Abso-flogging-lutely.
I think a bit of skulduggery would do you good.
Take your mind off this Pan business.
First thing tomorrow morning, we'll shoot some Indians out at Long Tom.
I'm tired of killing Indians and Lost Boys.
I always kill them.
I want to kill Peter Pan.
I wanna kill him!
Hear me?
I want to kill him.
Oh, dear.
I've just had an apostrophe.
I think you mean an "epiphany."
Lightning has just struck my brain.
Well, that must hurt.
-Pan's kids....
-What about them?
You could make them like you.
Say, what?
No, no, no.
We could make the little buggers love you.
No little children love me.
-Captain, that is the point.
-What do you mean?
That is the ultimate revenge.
-What is?
-Pan's kids in love with Hook.
What're you getting on about?
-It's the ultimate payback.
-What is?
Imagine Pan when he faces you, and his kids standing beside you ready to fight for the sleaziest sleaze of the seven seas, Captain Hook.
-Captain, it's beautiful.
-Yes, I see.
You know, Smee I like it, I like it, I like it!
Oh, Smee, what a superb idea I've just had!
Tomorrow, I'll make Pan's brats love me.
Peter Pan will fly again.
He'll remember how.
And if he doesn't, those dirty Lost Boys will jog his memory.
Oh, yes, you'll see.
He'll crow, he'll fight, he'll fly and then, he'll die.
Pick 'em up
Move 'em down
Pick 'em on up
Move 'em on down
Ain't no time to celebrate
You are old and overweight
Gotta lose a million pounds
Get your fa t butt off the ground Reach on down and touch your toes
How long since you looked at those?
Shape up
Lose weight
Get thin
Gotta win
Jumping jacks are good for you Now your face is turning blue
Swing your arms around your back
Give yourself a heart attack Gotta train
In the rain
In the sun
In the snow
Ten below Gotta move
Gotta do Gotta grow
Go easy on me.
I'm a beginner.
Low!
High!
High!
All right, gramps.
Give it your best shot.
Rufio's only trying to help.
Listen.
Learn.
Okay, you ready?
I don't wanna hurt you.
Watch your skin!
Be bangerang, old man.
What are you doing?
How does this help me get my kids back?
What do I have to do next?
Next, time to fly.
Just think happy thoughts.
All you need is one happy thought, Peter, and it'll make you fly.
I got it!
Not being in this slingshot would make me very happy!
He's going up!
He's coming down!
Now, pay attention, class.
We have a lot to go over.
" Lesson one:
Why parents hate their children."
Anyone?
Doesn't Mommy read to us every night?
You, the cute little urchin in the front row....
Won't you share your thoughts with the whole class?
Yes.
I said Mommy reads to us every night because she loves us very much.
Loves you?
lsn't that....
The " L" word, captain.
No, child.
Your mother reads to you every night in order to stupefy you to sleep so that she and Daddy can sit down for three minutes without you and your mindless, inexhaustible, unstoppable, repetitive demands:
" He took my toy."
"She hid my bear."
" I want to potty.
I want a cookie.
I want to stay up."
" I want, I want, I want!" " Me, me, me, me!"
" Mine, mine, mine, mine!"
" Now, now, now!"
Can't you understand, child?
-They tell you stories to shut you up.
-And conk you out.
That's not true, Jack.
You're a liar!
Lie?
Me?
Never!
The truth is far too much fun.
Before you were born, your parents would stay up all night together just to see the sunrise.
Don't be frightened.
Maggie, before you were born, they were happier.
They were free.
You are a bad man.
Smee, flunk the maggot.
Abso-flogging-lutely.
An " F"?
He gave me an " F" !
Your father went to your sister's school play, did he not?
But did he go to your baseball game?
How'd you know about that?
He missed the most important game on the most important day of your young life.
-I wanna tear your hook off!
-Easy.
I hate, I hate you, Mr. Hook!
What did I tell you, Smee?
No little children love me.
Of course they do.
Come on.
You're depressing the captain.
Jack, listen to me!
Never let him make you forget!
Never forget Mommy and Daddy!
Think of a way to run home, Jack!
Run home!
Run home?
You are home.
Right?
Oh, yeah.
No, no, no.
We don't use them.
-Why do you have them?
-So we don't have to use them.
Don't crowd me!
Come on, Thud Butt!
Everybody say grace.
Bless this, Lord--
Grace!
All of my favourite Never Foods!
Yams, mamey apples and banana squash!
Wash it down, calabash and papaw!
Can you blow on this?
Thank you.
This is good!
Are you eating that?
No, please.
Eat!
What's the deal?
Where's the real food?
If you can't imagine yourself being Peter Pan, you won't be him, so eat up!
Eat what?
There's nothing here.
Gandhi ate more than this.
This used to be your favourite game.
Forget the games.
I want real food!
Steak, eggs--
You can't.
Eat your heart out, you crinkled, wrinkled fat bag!
-You're very ill-mannered--
-You're a slug-eating worm.
You can do better than that!
You're encouraging them?
Show me your fastball, dust brain!
You paunchy, sag-bottomed puke pot!
Bangerang, Rufio!
You're a very poor role model for these kids, you know?
You don't have a fourth-grade reading level.
-Haemorrhoidal sucknavel.
-Maybe a fifth-grade reading level.
Oil-dripping, beef-fart sniffing bubble butt.
Someone has a severe caca mouth.
You know that?
You are a fart factory!
Slug-slime sack of rat guts and cat vomit cheesy scab picked pimple-squeezing finger bandage!
A week-old maggot burger with everything on it and flies on the side!
Substitute chemistry teacher.
Come on, Rufio, hit him back.
Mung tongue!
-Math tutor.
-Pinhead.
-Prison barber.
-Mother lover.
Nearsighted gynaecologist.
-In your face, camelcake!
-In your rear, cow derriere!
Lying, crying, spying, prying ultra-pig!
Lewd, crude bag of pre-chewed food dude.
Bangerang, Peter!
You man!
Stupid, stupid man!
If I'm a maggot burger, why don't you just eat me?
You zebra-headed, slime-coated, pimple-farming, paramecium brain munching on your own mucus, suffering from Peter Pan envy!
What's a " paramecium brain"?
I'll tell you what a paramecium is!
That's a paramecium!
It's a one-celled critter with no brain that can't fly!
Don't mess with me, man!
I'm a lawyer!
Banning, Banning!
Rufio!
Rufio!
Oh, Rufio, why don't you just go suck on a dead dog's nose?
You're doing it.
-Doing what?
-Using your imagination, Peter.
You're playing with us, Peter.
You're doing it, Peter.
Drink your papaw, Peter.
How is it?
Bangerang.
Catch!
Hey, Pockets catch!
Oh, Don't Ask!
Bangerang!
Hey, Pan the Man, catch this!
Peter, look out!
Peter, watch out!
Bangerang.
Peter can I talk to you?
Sure, Thud.
-I remember Tootles.
-You do?
He was lost too.
How could you know Tootles?
He was a Lost Boy.
These are his marbles.
These are his happy thoughts.
-He really did lose his marbles.
-Yeah, he lost them good.
Peter, you know what?
My happy thought will help you.
What's your happy thought?
Mine's my mother.
Do you remember your mother, Peter?
Wish I could.
Listen.
My mom sang that song.
My young Jack, tell me about the game of baseball.
I can't remember.
Are the mates standing or are they on horseback?
The stars are all my friends
Till the nighttime ends
So I know I'm not alone
When I'm here on my own
Isn't that a wonder
When you're alone
You're not alone
Not really alone
Good night, Never Land!
What is it?
I hear it.
I hear it again.
Smee, it's that crocodile, back from the dead!
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock!
Is that the clock?
You killed that croc years ago.
We smash every clock we find.
Little elf didn't know any better.
To the museum, at once.
Shine 'em up!
Put a fresh coat of varnish on your peg, right here!
Broken clocks....
Each one ticked its last tock, and now all is well.
Just listen.
I don't hear anything.
I know!
Good form!
Exactly!
Jack, you see this?
Come over here.
You can take it.
This is Barbecue's very own bedside clock.
He was quite an infamous pirate.
I smashed this clock immediately after I gutted him.
His ship made a pretty bonfire!
Such a pretty, pretty....
What is that I hear?
A ticking?
Smee, stop the ticking!
Stop that!
Stop that "tick-tick" !
There's no ticking here.
There's nothing left to tick.
Oh, my God!
This is for the ticking that might have been.
Get his father's watch!
Go on.
You know you want to.
Give it a try.
Go on.
This is for never letting me blow bubbles in my chocolate milk!
-Good form!
Bravo!
-Isn't that wonderful?
This is for never letting me jump on my own bed!
Make time stand still, laddie.
For always making promises and breaking them!
For never doing anything with me.
For a father who's never there, Jack?
Jack, for a father who didn't save you on the ship.
Who wouldn't save us....
Who couldn't save you, Jack.
He wouldn't.
He didn't even try.
He was there, we were there, and he wouldn't try.
Jack he will try.
And the question will be:
When the time comes, do you want to be saved?
Now, don't you answer now.
No, no, no, no.
Now it's time to be whatever you want to be.
Put behind you any thoughts of home that place of broken promises.
That what?
Have I ever made a promise, Jack I have not kept?
Have I, son?
Come on.
Let's go!
I don't like this game.
"Steal Hook's hook As fast as you can."
" It'll make you proud."
"Then you crow like Pan."
Confound it, Druscilla, glove me.
The game is about to start.
I need my bubbly.
Give me my bubbly.
Steal Hook's hook, then crow!
Jackie, boy!
Jack!
This is for all the games your daddy missed.
Hook would never miss your game, son.
You're almost there.
Take it.
-What's he looking at?
-Come on, you're this close!
What's wrong?
-Grab it, come on.
-Grab it, Peter!
Come on, Jack.
And one!
Wait for the good pitches.
Wait for the good pitches!
Jack!
Jack!
He's our man.
If he can't do it, no one can!
He's stealing second!
No, now stop it!
We're playing this game according to Master Jack's rules!
Bad form!
Sit down now!
Let's resume the game!
Very violent sport, isn't it, baseball?
Come on, Jack!
Run home, Jack!
Run home, Jack!
" Run home, Jack."
Smee, no, no, no!
They've got it backwards!
Tell them to turn it around!
Maggie?
Switch!
Home run, Jack!
Home run, Jack!
Home run, Jack!
Home run, Jack.
Home run, Jack.
He can't hit the curve.
My Jack!
My Jack.
You did it!
Hoist him up!
That's my boy!
You did it, son!
Gotta fly!
Happy thought.
Happy thought, happy thought, happy thought, happy....
One great, big happy thought!
Less is more.
I can...!
"Tootles.
Wendy.
John.
Michael.
Peter."
Be careful, Peter.
You're a lot taller than you used to be.
Well, say something.
Do you like my dress?
You look beautiful.
What's the occasion?
You are.
It's a welcome-home party.
What happened here?
Hook.
Burnt it when you didn't come back.
Kiss.
Wendy.
This is Wendy's house.
Tootles and Nibs built it for her.
I remember.
Wendy would sit in that chair.
But it wasn't there.
It was here.
We used to sit here while she'd darn socks and tell us stories.
She slept here.
Tink, your apartment was right here.
Yes.
Little Michael in his basket bed, right here.
John.
Teddy.
My Teddy.
Mother used to put him in the pram to keep me company.
I remember my mother.
I remember her.
You can be sure, very fine schools indeed.
First, he will attend Whitehall, then Oxford.
And of course after graduation, he will prepare for a judgeship in the highest court making time for marriage and family and all of that.
Just like his father.
Isn't that what grownups want for their children?
I was afraid.
I didn't wanna grow up.
Everybody who grows up has to die someday.
So I ran away.
Tink you came and you saved me.
You brought me to Never Land.
You taught me to fly.
But I was still a little boy, and I missed my mother.
So I decided to fly home to my very own window.
But it was shut.
They'd forgotten about me.
I found other windows to visit, ones that weren't shut closed on me.
That's how I met Wendy.
I chased my shadow in her nursery.
I expected my shadow and I would join together like drops of water.
Boy!
Why are you crying?
What's your name?
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.
What's yours?
I came back many times for Wendy.
Always in the spring.
And Wendy kept getting older. ..
...and older.
And then I came back the last time.
Peter, I can't come with you.
I've forgotten how to fly.
I'm old, Peter.
Ever so much more than 20.
-I grew up a long time ago.
-No, no, no!
-You promised!
-I have children of my own now.
They have children of their own.
That's my grandchild, Moira, asleep in the bed.
When I saw her lying there sleeping at that moment, something changed in me forever.
I shall give her a kiss.
No!
No, Peter!
No buttons, no thimbles.
I couldn't bear her heart to be broken when she finds she can't keep you.
No.
I mean a real kiss.
I can see why you have trouble finding a happy thought.
So many sad memories, Peter.
Bye, Teddy.
Not Teddy.
Daddy!
Daddy!
Peter, you're a daddy.
Hi, Jack.
I know why I came back.
I know why I grew up.
I wanted to be a fa ther.
I'm a daddy.
My happy thought.
I got it!
I got it!
I found it!
I lost it!
Just hold that happy thought, Peter!
Peter Pan!
He's back!
He's back!
He's back!
Play!
Play!
You are the Pan.
You can fly, you can fight, and you can--
Tink, you in there?
Are you sad?
No, I'm neither.
Please go away.
Oh, you're sick.
You need a Band-Aid.
Or a thermometer!
That's how Nibs made the Wendy lady better.
Oh, no, Peter!
It's not about that!
Yes, it is!
Nibs put the thermometer in her mouth.
Felt all better.
Don't we have the greatest adventures?
Do you remember your next great adventure to save your kids?
Kids?
Peter Pan's got kids?
Why are you in Never Land?
To always be a little boy and have fun.
I like this game.
Ask me another one.
Oh, dear me!
I did it.
Tink, look what happened!
You broke your house.
You're humongous.
This is the only wish I ever wished for myself.
This is the biggest feeling I've ever, ever felt.
And this is the first time I've been big enough to have it.
Peter, I wanna give you a kiss.
No, I mean a real kiss.
I love you, Peter Pan.
I love her.
" Her," who?
Mo--
Moira!
I love Moira and Jack and Maggie.
Jack and Maggie....
I have a plan.
Tink?
Come on.
You gotta come.
When it's all over, you'll leave and never come back again.
What are you staring at, Peter?
Save them.
Go save them.
You silly ass, go!
Jack, it's a very special time when a pirate receives his first earring.
It's like the first time you run someone through with your blade.
Now, Jack I'm gonna ask you to bend your head ever so slightly.
A little more.
That's it.
And brace yourself, lad.
Because this is really going to hurt.
Smee, what is that?
Who is that, captain?
It's Peter Pan.
Has it been three days?
'Tis true, Peter time does fly.
And so do you, I see.
How did you ever manage to fit into those smashing tights again, Peter?
Hand over my son now and you and your men may go free.
Why don't you ask the lad yourself?
Jack, someone to see you, son.
Jack, give me your hand.
We're going home.
I am home.
Good form!
You see, Peter, he is my son.
He loves me dearly.
And I'm prepared to fight dearly for him.
I've waited long to shake your hand with this.
Peter Pan, prepare to meet thy doom!
Dark and sinister man, have at thee.
Don't you love it, laddie?
Once you've shed blood, it's hard to stop!
It's a pirate's life, my lad!
Jack, Jack!
-Don't I know him?
-No, you've never seen him before!
You won't believe this, but I found my happy thought.
It took me three days, then guess what happened?
Up I went!
You know what my happy thought was?
It was you.
That's my dad...but he hates to fly!
Bangerang!
Call out the militia!
We'll need every last man!
If there's anybody not fighting, get here quick!
Form ranks!
Form ranks!
Show them the white light we're made of!
Remember the fires from hell that forged you!
Charge!
Now!
We'll show you who's chicken!
Watch this!
Smee!
Do something intelligent!
"Smee, Smee" !
What about Smee?
What about Smee?
What about me?
Thud ball!
Fire!
Hey, wait!
Look out below!
Somebody help!
Here we go.
Take it, take it, take it!
Lost Boys, down!
My eyes!
It's time for Smee.
Where do you think you're going?
Get away from that window!
Hook!
Rufio.
The old man is mine.
Jack!
Save me!
Maggie!
Get down here!
Maggie!
Daddy!
Wait, ain't you--
Peter Pan.
Daddy!
Daddy?
Peter Pan's my dad?
I'll never lose you again.
Lost Boys, we got them on the run!
Here comes Pan!
Looky, looky, I got Hooky.
Hook!
No!
Do you know what I wish?
What?
I wish I had a dad like you.
Oh, Dad, I'm sorry.
Are you ready for me, Peter?
Come on.
Humour the Hook.
Dad.
I wanna go home.
What are you talking about?
You are home.
Where are you going?
Lost Boys!
Peter!
Where are you going?
Come back here and fight me!
I'll find you wherever you are!
Bad form, Peter!
Come back.
You need a mother very, very badly!
Smee!
Follow me!
-Stairs!
-Just moving your personal....
Wherever you go, wherever you are I vow there will always be daggers bearing notes signed "James Hook."
They will be flung at the doors of your children's children's children.
Do you hear me?
What do you want, old man?
Just you.
You've got me, James Hook.
Pan "The Avenger" is back.
And the Hook is waiting, Peter Pan.
It's Hook and me this time.
-Prepare to die.
-To die would be a great adventure.
Death is the only adventure you have left.
I remember you being a lot bigger.
To a 1 0-year-old, I'm huge.
No pain, no gain, James!
Good form, old man.
You know you're not really Peter Pan.
This is only a dream.
You'll wake up, you'll be Peter Banning, a selfish man who drinks too much who's obsessed with success and runs and hides from his wife and children.
I believe in you.
-I believe in you.
-I believe in you, Peter.
I believe in you.
You are the Pan.
You're Peter Pan.
I believe in you Peter Pan.
-Bad form!
-Jack, stop!
Now we end this.
You blackguard!
Hello!
Tick-tock, tick-tock Hook's afraid of an ordinary clock!
I think not!
I think James Hook's afraid of time, ticking away!
Tick....
Good form, Peter.
I am fallen.
Give me my dignity.
You took my hand.
You owe me something.
You killed Rufio.
You kidnapped my children.
You deserve to die.
Strike, Peter Pan.
Strike true.
Daddy, let's go home.
Please?
He's just a mean old man without a mommy.
Yeah, Dad, let's go.
He can't hurt us anymore.
Bless you, child.
Good form, Jack.
After all, what would the world be like without Captain Hook?
I want you to take your ship and go.
I never want to see your face in Never Land again.
-Peter, look out!
-Fools, James Hook is Never Land!
Whenever children read, it will say:
"Thus perished Peter Pan."
What's happening?
I want my Mommy!
Hook's gone.
Hook's gone!
Hook's gone!
Bangerang!
No more Hook!
No more Hook!
No more Hook!
Hurray for Pan the Man!
What's wrong, Peter?
I can't stay.
I've done what I came to do, and now I have to go back.
Tink, make my kids glow.
Jack, Maggie, all you have to do is think one happy thought and you'll fly like me.
Mommy!
My dad Peter Pan.
Tink, you know the way.
I'll be just behind you.
Don't leave us, Peter, and don't say goodbye.
What's "goodbye"?
It's going away.
That's what it is.
Forgetting about us all over again.
You're all my Lost Boys.
I'll never forget you.
Never.
So who do I leave in charge?
I want you to take care of everyone who's smaller than you.
Then who do I look after?
Never Bugs.
Little ones.
That was a great game.
Thank you for believing.
I know her.
She looks like an angel.
Let's not wake her yet.
My dear child, have you been up all night?
I see them in their beds so often in my dreams.
When I wake up, they're still there.
Tink?
Tink?
Tink?
Hello.
Having trouble with the missis?
You will have, by the time you get home.
Tink!
Say it, Peter.
Say it and mean it.
I believe in faeries.
Do you know that place between sleep and awake where you still remember dreaming?
That's where I'll always love you Peter Pan.
That's where I'll be waiting.
Nana!
Oh, give us a kiss!
Come here, you drool machine!
Tink?
Brad!
Hi!
Have you been holding this long?
I'm incredible!
Yeah.
Never Land!
Lost Boys.
Jim Hook.
Duel to the death.
I'll fill you in later.
Listen, I'd love to chat but I gotta climb a drainpipe now.
Why?
Because I ran out of faerie dust.
If not, I would've flown up.
Why!
!
-There were pirates--!
-And monsters there!
Just like you said!
Granny Wendy!
Let me in!
Please.
Excuse me, do you have an appointment?
What did I tell you about this window?
Always keep it open!
Never, ever, ever close....
I have to take this.
Have you ever known what it's like to feel the exhilaration of really flying?
Feel this.
Where have you been?
Fly me, Daddy, fly me!
Anytime, Maggie.
To infinity and back again.
Hello, Peter.
I missed the adventure again, didn't I?
I think these belong to you.
Look!
See, look!
I didn't lose my marbles after all!
Wendy, look!
See?
I didn't lose my marbles after all!
Hello, boy.
Hello, Wendy lady.
Give us a skwoodge.
Boy, why are you crying?
I don't know.
A tear for every happy thought.
One for me?
-One for me?
-One for me?
And one for me!
Seize the day!
So your adventures are over.
Oh, no.
To live....
To live would be an awfully big adventure.
Ripped by Krtek / DivXCZ Team
Boy, why are you crying?
I was crying because I couldn't get my shadow to stick.
Besides, I wasn't crying.
"l shall sew it on for you, my little man. lt may hurt a little."
I shall sew it on for you, my little man.
It may hurt a little.
What is your name?
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.
- What's yours?
- Peter Pan.
Watch your daughter.
She's wonderful.
- Yeah.
- She's stealing the show.
I think it's perfectly sweet of you.
- Louder!
- l think it's perfectly sweet of you.
- Louder!
- l think it's perfectly sweet of you.
I shall give you a kiss if you like.
Don't you know what a kiss is?
I shall once you give one to me.
Now I shall give you a kiss.
I don't ever want to become a man.
Yuck!
I always want to be a little boy and to have fun.
We wanna be like Peter Pan
We don't wanna grow up
Brad.
I'm at my daughter's play.
Then when it's time to be a man
We're not gonna show up lt's impossible.
I'm on a plane to London tomorrow night with my family.
A children's hospital--
A children's hospital is dedicating an entire wing to Granny Wendy.
- Peter, you're missing it.
- All right.
Want a meeting tomorrow, a.m.?
Dad, my game.
You promised.
Listen, it's my son's big game.
Last game of the season, Santa Series.
I gotta be there. I promised.
So, we'll make it a short meeting.
I'll be there.
My word is my bond.
We never, never, never, never
Never, ever wanna grow up Yuck
Strike three, you're out!
Jack!
Come on, Blue Jays!
Where is your father?
He's missing it.
Daddy'll be here.
He promised.
- Jerry, Jack--
- Jim.
I said that.
Take the video camera, go to the game, film what I miss.
-Can I say something?
-Mr.
Banning, here's the tribute speech.
- On cards?
- Yes, sir.
- Number those.
Who wrote it?
- Ned Miller.
I loved his annual report.
Read it back to me.
"Lord Whitehall, honored guests, for the past 70 years...
- the Granny Wendy we honor tonight...
- That's nice.
has given hope and care and life to hundreds of homeless children."
Great.
Very personal.
Mommy, where is Daddy?
- My briefcase--
- Banning.
Well, gotta fly.
Don't worry.
More people crash in cars than on planes.
It's safer to fly than crossing the street.
Don't look down.
Well, if it's your time to go, it's your time to go.
And remember, don't let your arms get tired!
What if it's the pilot's time to go?
Come on, keep us alive, Banning!
- Okay, come on!
- Hi, Mrs. Banning!
I'm from the office.
- Which one's your son?
- He's up to bat.
Thank you.
Don't look at me.
Focus!
Stay focused.
Come on, Jack.
One time.
Please not a curve ball.
Mama wants a new pair of shoes.
Drive me home, Jack!
That's a game.
Two, four, six, eight Who do we appreciate
Blue Jays
Yeah, Brad.
That's real good.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Please do not allow this minor turbulence to disturb you.
For now, please sit back and relax, and enjoy the remainder of the flight.
Thank you.
- Look what Jack drew.
- That's very nice, dear.
- What's that?
- Fire.
Fire?
Really?
- ls that our plane?
- Yep.
- Who are all these people?
- That's Jack, that's me... that's Mom, and that's you.
Where's my parachute?
I'm not gonna make it to my next birthday.
You're not gonna die without a phone and fax machine.
I'm halfway there.
I got the phone in the briefcase.
Talk to him.
Why didn't I have a parachute, Jackie?
Take a wild guess.
- Jackie--
- Jack.
Will you stop that?
You can break a window.
They're double-layered.
You can't break them.
Give me that.
You're afraid you're gonna get sucked out.
I'm not afraid of being sucked out.
Yes, you are.
You're afraid you're going to be sucked out.
Just stop.
Jack, next season I'm coming to six games. I promise.
Yeah, be sure to buy enough videotape.
Hey, Jack.
My word is my bond.
Yeah, junk bonds.
What the hell's the matter with you?
When will you stop acting like a child?
I am a child.
Grow up.
It's been a long time.
Let's have fun, Peter.
London's a magical place for children.
Well, it was for us.
It's gotten very expensive.
Jack, don't.
You could put someone's eye out.
Maggie.
- Peter, it's number 14.
- Oh, 14.
Okay.
Now, what do you say to Granny Wendy? "How do you do?"
Jack, get down from there.
You'll break your neck.
Be careful.
is Granny Wendy the real Wendy from my play?
- Not really.
- Sort of.
Don't be a sloucher.
Take that gum out of your mouth.
It's time to look our best.
Remember, dears:
First impressions are the most important.
Shoes tied, shirt tucked.
Give me this.
All right.
Remember, you're in England, land of good manners.
- Uncle Tootles.
- lt's snowing!
Look at these adorable children!
It's good to see you, Libby, Linda-
- Lisa!
- Liza.
- l said that.
Moira, how are you?
Look at the size of the-- Look at you, such a big, sweet thing.
- Granny Wendy will be right down.
- She's upstairs?
Oh, good.
No baseball.
- Did you do this for us?
- Yes, I did.
- Thank you.
- l've been cooking all week.
What have you been cooking?
Mince pies?
Brandy snaps?
Oh, Peter, look at this.
- Who's that?
- lt's you.
- Was I ever that young?
- Yes.
- What's gotten into you?
- Oh, this house has gotten to me.
Some of those things I was when I was young have never left me.
Oh, thank God, Peter.
We were children in these rooms.
Lost, lost, lost.
Lost what?
I've lost my marbles.
- Okay.
Lisa?
- Liza.
Liza. I thought he was supposed to be in a home.
It broke Wendy's heart.
After all, Tootles is Wendy's first orphan.
- Which is which?
- The large bag is mine... that one's Moira's, and the two smaller ones are the children's.
Hello, boy.
Hello, Wendy.
I told you, Gran, I'd get him here, by hook or by crook.
Sorry it's been so long between visits.
It's been ten years between visits, but never mind.
Come and give me a squdge.
And this lovely lady can't-- it can't be Maggie.
Yes, it can.
And know what, Great-Grandma?
- l just played you at school.
- And don't you just look the part.
Oh, can this giant be Jack?
How much you've grown in a year.
Oh, can this giant be Jack?
How much you've grown in a year.
I'm supposed to tell you about congratulations for opening the... I'm supposed to tell you about congratulations for opening the... orphan hospital, and how great the dedication is.
orphan hospital, and how great the dedication is.
And-
- Yeah.
- Thank you so very much.
- You're welcome.
Now, there is one rule I insist be obeyed while you are in my house.
Now, there is one rule I insist be obeyed while you are in my house.
No growing up.
Stop this very instant... and that includes you, Mr. Chairman of the Board Banning.
Sorry.
Too late, Gran.
And what is so terribly important about your terribly important business?
And what is so terribly important about your terribly important business?
Well, you see, when a big company's in trouble, Dad sails in.
- And if there's any resistance, Dad--
- He's exaggerating.
I'm still into mergers and acquisitions and I'm dabbling into land development.
I'm still into mergers and acquisitions and I'm dabbling into land development.
Any resistance, and he blows them out of the water.
So, Peter, you've become a pirate.
So, Peter, you've become a pirate.
- Peter!
- What?
Brad's on the line.
He says it's urgent.
- Peter, do you like my dress?
- Great, Gran.
Real nice.
Thanks.
Brad.
Good news?
What?
What Sierra Club report?
I thought we had these guys.
He's trying to suck my blood, and he drools all over my neck.
- What did they find?
- Peter, that's a portable phone.
- A Cozy Blue Owl?
- There's nine other room in the house.
Well, listen.
Tell them there've always been casualties of evolution.
Ask them if anybody misses the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
I do.
Boy, do I ever.
Wow.
Are you kidding?
Wait a minute.
A ten-inch owl has a 50-mile mating radius?
Wait a minute.
A ten-inch owl has a 50-mile mating radius?
Why don't they just fornicate someplace else?
A $5 billion deal falling apart because of this?
A $5 billion deal falling apart because of this?
Why doesn't somebody just shoot me in the head?
Bang!
Bang!
- Will everybody just shut up!
- l'm sorry.
Leave me alone for one moment.
Moira, get them outta here.
I'm on the phone call of my life.
Come on, Jack.
Out.
Come with me.
I'll show you the window where your father and I used to blow out the stars.
I never should have come. I should have stayed till the deal was done.
You haven't been here for ten years, though Granny asked you every year.
- l've been busy.
- You promised the kids some real time.
- l just got here.
- You've done nothing but yell at them.
- That's not true.
- How many more broken promises, Peter?
I'm sorry.
It's Brad.
I gotta take this call.
I gotta fix this.
No.
You've got to fix your family first.
Peter, hello.
Are you there?
What- l'm sorry about your deal.
- You hated the deal.
I hated the deal, but I'm sorry you feel so badly about it.
Your children love you.
They want to play with you.
How long do you think that lasts?
Soon Jack may not even want you to come to his games.
We have a few special years with our children... when they're the ones that want us around.
After that, you're going to be running after them for a bit of attention.
It's so fast, Peter.
It's a few years, and then it's over.
And you are not being careful.
And you are missing it.
Peter, where are you?
All children, except one, grow up.
All children, except one, grow up.
You know where fairies come from, don't you, Maggie?
"When the first baby laughed for the first time... the laugh broke into a thousand pieces... and they all went skipping about.
That was the beginning of fairies."
And look.
I'm Wendy.
Or was, a long time ago.
But Jack says you're not the really real Wendy.
But Jack says you're not the really real Wendy.
Ah, well, you see where Jack is?
Well, that is the same window, and this is the same room... where we made up stories about Peter and Neverland and scary old Captain Hook.
where we made up stories about Peter and Neverland and scary old Captain Hook.
And do you know, Mr. Barrie-- well, Sir James-- our neighbor...
And do you know, Mr. Barrie-- well, Sir James-- our neighbor... he loved our stories so much that he wrote them all down in a book... oh, dear me, 80 years ago.
You're really old.
That's very true.
I'm sorry I have to break this up, but I have to steal Granny Wendy... or she'll be late for the most important event of her life.
Oh, dear.
Daddy, I made something for you.
You're gonna love this.
It's a hug.
Next time you fly you won't have to be scared.
She's made you a parachute.
That's very clever, dear.
Jack, get away from there.
What have I told you about open windows?
Keep this window closed.
I've told you this a hundred times.
- Do we have open windows at home?
- No, they've all got bars on them.
Come on, into bed.
Who took my baseball?
That mean, scary man at the window stole it.
- There's no scary man.
- But he says he's a window washer.
- There's no scary man.
- But he says he's a window washer.
- What is this?
- This is a baseball glove.
You can catch things with it, take hot things out of the oven... or hit your sister with it.
Tootles made it for me.
- lt smells nice.
- lt's paper, honey.
Night.
Hey, Jack.
Faker.
Jack, you're in charge now.
This is my very special watch so you can keep track of the time.
Don't go out, Mom, please.
Good night.
Dear night lights, protect my sleeping babes.
Burn clear and steadfast tonight.
I read recently that they're now using lawyers instead of rats... for scientific experiments.
They do this for two reasons.
One, the scientists become less attached to the lawyers.
And two, there are certain things that even rats won't do.
I want to thank the board of trustees of the Great Ormond Street Hospital... for having me here this evening, and beg your forgiveness... because normally I'm used to addressing shareholders.
We don't know each other, and I doubt that we have very much in common...
We don't know each other, and I doubt that we have very much in common... except this wonderful woman, Wendy Angela Darling.
Granny Wendy brought me in from the cold.
She taught me to read and write.
She even found people to be my parents and adopt me.
She's loved so many children... just so efforlet-- effors-- effortlessly.
just so efforlet-- effors-- effortlessly.
That's her achievement.
Many of you here tonight were once lost children... but Granny Wendy found parents and homes for each of you... and saved you-- that's her miracle.
And I know that if you could stand now you would express... much better than I have your feelings of... gratitude... appreciation... and warm feelings... for this wonderful woman.
I guess we do have something in common.
We're orphans.
Hook!
Are you all right?
Thank you, Nigel-
- Norman?
- Neville, sir.
- Neville. ls that English?
Merry Christmas.
- l was proud of you.
- Really?
It was a beautiful speech.
Hello?
My God.
The children.
Maggie?
Jack, answer me!
The wind came up, the door closed on me... and the children were screaming.
The window.
"Dear Peter, your presence is required at the request of your children."
"Kindest personal regards, JAS Hook...
"Kindest personal regards, JAS Hook...
Captain."
Have to fly.
Have to fight.
Have to crow.
Have to save Maggie.
Have to save Jack.
Hook is back.
Who?
Gran?
Well, the lab boys can analyze this little lot.
Mr. and Mrs. Banning, we've wired the phones, and two men will stay outside.
Mr. and Mrs. Banning, we've wired the phones, and two men will stay outside.
Of course, it is possible this whole thing is some kind of ridiculous prank.
My children are missing.
Yes, but the literary history of the family and everything suggests--
- Well, let's hope so.
- l've forgotten how to fly.
Yes, well, one does.
Good night, then, ma'am, sir.
No more happy thoughts.
Lost.
Nothing we can do.
The police will do everything--
The police can do nothing.
Oh, really?
Maybe we should call the American police.
In a crisis, we English always make a cup of tea.
Moira, would you?
- Tea?
- Of course, Gran.
Don't forget to warm the pot.
- l'll go.
Moira--
- Peter.
You stay.
Don't worry, Granny Wendy.
I wasn't going to leave.
Hand me my book, please.
It's time to tell you at last.
Tell me what?
How far back can you remember, Peter?
I remember the hospital on Great Ormond Street.
You worked with orphans, you taught me to read.
You arranged for the adoption by my American parents, Hank and Jane Banning.
You were 12-- nearly 13.
I mean before that.
There's nothing before that.
Try, Peter.
Do try.
Nothing.
You know, when I was young... no other girl held your favor the way I did.
I half expected you to alight on the church and forbid my vows... on my wedding day.
I wore a pink satin sash.
But you didn't come.
Grandma--
Yes, I was an old lady when I wrapped you in blankets... a grandmother... with my 13-year-old granddaughter asleep in the bed-
- Moira.
with my 13-year-old granddaughter asleep in the bed-
- Moira.
And when you saw her... that was when you decided not to go back to Neverland.
Where?
To Never-Neverland.
Moira!
I'm getting Moira.
- l've tried to tell you so many times--
- Maybe the tea's ready.
- l knew you'd forgotten.
- l'm not ready to deal with this now.
The stories are true, I swear to you.
I swear on everything I adore.
And now he's come back to seek his revenge.
The fight isn't over for Captain James Hook.
He wants you back.
He knows you'll follow Maggie and Jack... to the ends of the earth and beyond, and by heaven you must find a way.
to the ends of the earth and beyond, and by heaven you must find a way.
Only you can save your children.
Somehow you must go back.
You must make yourself remember.
Remember what?
Peter, don't you know who you are?
Yes, boy.
Sorry.
Parachute.
Firefly from hell!
Big damn bug!
Oh, it is you, it is!
A big you.
I guess it's not bad that you're big.
You were always bigger than me.
But now maybe this means you'll be twice as much fun.
What fun we'll have again!
What times!
What great games!
You're a little f--
Fairy.
Pixie.
And if less is more, there's no end to me, Peter Pan.
- Peter Banning.
- Pan.
Whoever you are, it's still you.
'Cause only one person has that smell.
Smell?
The smell of someone who's ridden the back of the wind, Peter.
The smell of a hundred fun summers of sleeping in trees... adventures with Indians and pirates.
Oh, remember, Peter?
The world was ours.
We could do everything or nothing.
All I had to be was anything, 'cause it was always us.
Oh, no. lt's finally happened.
I'm having a total nervous breakdown.
Oh, no. lt's finally happened.
I'm having a total nervous breakdown.
Peter, follow me and all will be well.
Or I'm dying.
I'm heading towards the white light.
I've left my body.
See, there's my house way down there.
There are my feet.
Oh, my God.
Where are we going?
- To save your children, of course.
- How do you know about my kids?
Everybody knows.
Captain Hook's got them and you've got to fight him.
Let's fly!
It is true, then.
You did grow up.
I drank poison for you.
You used to call me Tink.
- Have you forgotten everything?
- Are you in there, little bug?
I'm not a bug.
I'm a fairy.
I do not believe in fairies.
Every time someone says, "l do not believe in fairies"... somewhere there's a fairy that falls down dead.
I do not believe in fairies!
Oh, my God, I think I killed it.
Are you alive, little bug?
Look out!
Clap your hands, Peter.
It's the only way to save me.
Louder.
Louder, Peter!
Okay, I'm clapping!
Oh, God, you're alive.
All right, now.
Who am I?
You're, um--
You're a Freudian hallucination having something to do with my mother... and I don't know why you have wings, but you have very lovely legs... and you're a very nice tiny person, and what am I saying?
I don't know who my mother was, I'm an orphan, and I've never taken drugs... because I missed the '60s, I was an accountant.
Guess again.
Oh, look.
Stars.
That's right, Peter.
Second star to the right and straight on till morning.
Neverland.
What a nightmare.
Moira!
Hear ye, hear ye!
Roll out.
Roll out!
Neverbirds!
Three for a farthing.
Pies for sale.
Lovely fish !
Fresh fish!
We keep the eyes in so they'll see you through the week.
Excuse me.
is there a pay phone around here?
- That is so real.
- Peter, get back here!
Get down, get low.
Hide!
Hello.
If it ain't the Mother Inferior.
Gentlemen, I'm looking for someone.
I fancy them shiny shoes for my booty.
You can get them at Armani.
Tink, help me!
Tinkerball-
- Tinkerbun--
Don't get no blood on them boots!
They's mine!
Help me, Tinkerbell!
You pixie devil!
Oh, please don't.
I have a bad back.
Ya pixie devil !
Are you related to Mighty Mouse?
If you insist on seeing Hook and desire to be alive when you do so... do exactly what I say.
Your left arm is dead, it hangs lifeless at your side.
Lean on the crutch!
Left foot turned in.
Tilt your head and glare with your good eye.
Now crack your mouth and drool.
Now growl.
Growl !
- How are you?
- Not bad, and you?
- Not bad!
- All right!
Put your faces on, girls.
Here comes Smee!
Follow that hook!
Make way for the hook!
He's gonna love this hook!
Hook, show us the hook
Hook, give us the hook
Good morning, Neverland!
Good morning, Mr. Smee!
- Tie down the main mast, mateys...
- Aye!
'cause here he is-- the cunning king fish... the bad barracuda... a man so deep, he's almost unfathomable.
a man so deep, he's almost unfathomable.
A man so quick, he's even fast asleep.
Thank you.
Now, let's give him a very big hand, 'cause he's only got one.
I give you the steel-handed stingray...
Captain James Hook!
See how greatly the men favor you, sir?
The pewling spawn-- how I despise them.
Go get 'em, Captain !
Thank you, thank you.
Well, my stupid, sorry, parasitic sacks of entrails...
Well, my stupid, sorry, parasitic sacks of entrails... revenge is mine.
Long live the hook!
I baited that hook, and now I'm very proud to announce... we have his children.
Oh, my God.
Jack and Maggie.
Long live Hook
Finally I'm going to kill Peter Pan... that cocky boy who cut off my hand and fed it to the crocodile!
And who killed that cunning crocodile?
Who stuffed him?
Who made him into a quiet clock?
Who went into the other world and stole Pan's children?
And who didn't believe I could do it?
Who doubted me?
Who amongst us does not belong?
Someone here does not belong, a stranger amongst the loyal.
I will weed you out.
You!
Where's the carpet, Smee?
Oh, sorry, sir.
You.
That's right, you.
No, not you.
Not you.
You.
You bet against me bringing Pan back here, didn't you?
No.
Tell your captain the truth.
Oh, say it.
- l did.
- Yes, you made a boo-boo.
The Boo Box.
Not that!
Not the Boo Box!
Good.
You cannot lie to the captain!
Boo!
- Long live Hook
- Put me down !
I want my mommy!
I want my daddy!
Hello, children.
Comfy?
Cozy?
Those are my kids!
Are you okay?
Everything's going to be all right.
Get out of the way!
Daddy's here.
Hook, I want those kids, or you better get an attorney that's better than me.
- Who are you?
- Peter Banning, attorney at law.
- Those are my children.
- Those are your--
- Children.
- These are your children?
- Yes, they are.
- And you're--
- Peter.
- You're Peter?
- ls there an echo in here?
- My great and worthy opponent?
- Yes.
- No!
Smee!
Who is this impostor?
Peter-floggin'-flyin'
-Pan !
No, I'm not Peter Pan.
I am just an ordinary-- l've got a sworn affidavit by a T-Bell.
I've got his medical history, I've even got his dental records.
- Excuse me.
- You tryin' to do me out of a job?
- What's the matter with you?
- May I show you something?
- Will you let go of me?
- Release him.
- May I show you this?
- Will you shut him up?
Oh, flog off.
Just shut up.
- Captain, put these on.
- l want to see the scar.
The hypertrophy.
Here's the scar where you sliced him during the Tiger Lily incident.
- That's my appendix.
- What's this?
Fairy footprints.
He's Peter Pan or I've got a dead man's dinghy.
Fairy footprints.
He's Peter Pan or I've got a dead man's dinghy.
is it you?
My great and worthy opponent?
But it can't be.
Not this pitiful, spineless, pasty, bloated codfish I see before me.
Not this pitiful, spineless, pasty, bloated codfish I see before me.
You're not even a shadow of Peter Pan.
I think we have an obligation to clarify this Pan problem...
- This disaster.
- which must be remedied.
- Expediently, I agree.
- l want my children.
- For me the stakes can be no higher.
- For me they can have sunk no lower.
I want my war!
Blow him out of the water, Dad!
Daddy's handling this.
It's okay.
Oh, come on, Peter.
Pick up your weapon.
All right.
How much?
Hoist and raise the kiddies!
Dad, help!
I'll make you a deal, Mr. Chairman of the Board.
Fly up there and touch the outstretched fingers... of your frightened children, and I'll set them free.
I can't fly.
Explode out of there!
Stop the charade!
Free your children!
- Dad, help!
- Daddy!
- l beg your pardon?
- l have a real problem with heights.
You must be joking.
Peter Pan has a real problem with heights.
- l'm not Peter Pan.
- Dad, help!
It's okay.
Hang on, son.
I'm coming, sweetheart.
Someone give me a hand.
I already have.
Help us, Daddy!
- Come on !
- Save us, Daddy!
Save me, Daddy!
You know who you are.
What new game is this, Peter?
Fly!
Stop pretending!
Fly!
I know it's you!
Be the Pan you are.
Fly.
Fly.
Think a happy thought.
All you have to do is touch our fingers and we'll be able to go home.
All you have to do is touch our fingers and we'll be able to go home.
Touch them, Peter, and it's all been just a bad dream.
Just reach out and touch them.
Flap your arms and fly!
Reach !
Come on, Daddy.
Mommy could do it.
Smee, I don't understand.
Why doesn't he fly?
is he not Peter Pan?
Smee, I don't understand.
Why doesn't he fly?
is he not Peter Pan?
He's Peter Pan, all right, Captain.
He's just been away from Neverland for so long, his mind's been "junk-tified."
He's just been away from Neverland for so long, his mind's been "junk-tified."
He's forgotten everything.
Please don't give up.
Dad.
I wanna go home.
Gentlemen, I'm afraid I have decided... to cancel the war.
He can't fly, but he can swim!
Kill them.
Kill them all.
- Dad!
- Bring on the plank!
And I never want to hear the name "Peter Pan" again!
What about the name "Hook"?
is that how you want to be remembered?
As a bully?
Or as the great warrior who defeated a heroic Pan?
One week and I'll get him in shape, and you can have your dirty old war.
It's a trick, Captain.
Let me blast that buzzing vixen to pixie hell.
It's a trick, Captain.
Let me blast that buzzing vixen to pixie hell.
Smee.
You promised people the war of the century.
Your whole life has been building to this moment.
Mortal combat, glory, Hook versus Pan!
That is not Pan.
Two days.
Four-- bare minimum for a decent Pan.
Three.
Final offer.
Done.
And you better deliver, Miss Bell... or no amount of clapping will bring you back from where l will send you.
Hear me, men.
For reasons of good form... I've decided that the so-called Pan will return in three days... to commence the arbitrament of the sword.
Smee, translate.
In three days we're gonna have a war... a battle between good and evil, to the death.
Help me.
Snow!
Hot.
What?
Help!
Get me down !
Oh, you're alive!
Oh, get me down!
I believe!
Lost Boys, Lost Boys, wake up!
Pan's back!
Lost Boys, wake up!
That was my pillow!
Sure, yeah, I'm up.
Wake up, you sleepyheads!
Pan's back!
Who's the shrub?
Bangerang!
That ain't Peter Pan.
- He's old.
- He's fat.
Not so fat to me.
He's an old, fat grandpa man.
Rufio!
Oh, that is so dangerous.
That's enough!
Okay, mister.
All right.
The show's over now.
You put that thing away, put it down before you poke somebody's eye out.
You put that thing away, put it down before you poke somebody's eye out.
You're not old enough to shave.
What are you doing with a sword?
Flying around-- This is an insurance nightmare!
What is this, some Lord of the Flies preschool?
Where are your parents?
Who's in charge here?
No, Mr. Skunkhead with too much mousse.
You are just a punk kid.
I want to speak to a grown-up.
- All grown-ups are pirates.
- Excuse me?
We kill pirates.
I'm not a pirate.
It so happens I am a lawyer.
Kill the lawyer!
I'm not that kind of lawyer.
I've been shot!
Help!
Help me, somebody!
Boys, listen!
He married Wendy's granddaughter!
Hook has kidnapped his kids.
He's just out of shape.
We have to make him bangerang.
Why are you doing this to me?
Rufio, you're the best with a sword.
Please teach him.
We gotta make him remember.
Excuse me.
- Help me!
- Help me!
- Not you.
- Not you?
Helmets!
Oh, my.
A wall.
Stop it!
Lost Boys, stop it!
Play!
You're dead, jolly man.
He can't do those things.
He can't even play simple games.
Hook has got his kids, and I've got three days... to get him ready to fight, and I need everybody's help.
Peter Pan's gots kids?
You can't fly, fight, or crow.
So... if any of you says this here scug ain't Peter Pan, cross the line.
if any of you says this here scug ain't Peter Pan, cross the line.
Hi.
What?
Be right back.
- What?
- You are embarrassing me!
Oh, there you are, Peter.
But, Peter, you've grown up.
You promised never to grow old.
But, Peter, you've grown up.
You promised never to grow old.
His nose got real big.
Well, welcome back to Neverland, Pan the Man.
Don't listen to that stinkin' fairy and that brainless fungus!
I got Pan's sword.
I'm the Pan now.
You think this guy's gonna take it from me, Rufio?
Wait!
If Tink believes, maybe he is.
Are you gonna follow this drooler... against Capitán Hook?
What's he doin' here if he's not Peter Pan, huh?
He don't look happy here.
And who are them kids Hook's got?
- Give him a chance!
- Those are my kids.
And Hook is gonna kill them unless we do something.
Help me.
Please?
Come on!
Give him a chance!
I should claw myself with my own hook, Smee.
Not to kill Pan when I had the chance.
What have I done?
What have I done, Smee?
Agreed to a preposterous plan?
An absurd war?
Now I'm bound by my indefatigable good form to wait.
- l'll fix you a nice plate.
- Wait for what?
Whether it be three days or decades, he will always be a fat old Pan.
Whether it be three days or decades, he will always be a fat old Pan.
Oh, I hate being disappointed, Smee... and I hate living in this flawed body... and I hate living in Neverland... and I hate, I hate... I hate Peter Pan!
I hate Peter Pan!
Smee, I've just had a sublime vision.
All the jagged parts of my life have come together... to form a complete and mystical whole.
An epiphany.
A piffy what?
- My life is over.
- You mean you've lost your appetite?
Yes.
Good-bye.
Where are you going?
Are you getting dramatic?
Good-bye, Smee.
Captain, why don't we play with your island, eh?
You know, all the little injuns and soldiers and all the Lost Boys?
You know, all the little injuns and soldiers and all the Lost Boys?
No stopping me this time, Smee.
This is it.
No stopping me this time, Smee.
This is it.
Don't make a move, Smee.
Not a step.
My finger's on the trigger.
- Don't try to stop me.
- On, not again.
This is it.
Don't try to stop me this time, Smee.
Don't try to stop me this time, Smee.
Don't you dare try to stop me this time.
Try to stop me.
Don't you dare try to stop me this time.
Try to stop me.
You'd better get up off your ass.
Get over here, Smee!
- l'm comin'!
- Stop me!
This is not a joke!
I'm committing suicide!
-Don't ever frighten me like that again.
-l'm sorry.
- Are you some kind of sadist?
- l'm sorry.
How do you feel now?
- l want to die.
- Oh, now, now.
- There's no adventure here.
- You call this no adventure?
Death is the only great adventure I have left.
- Let's get you into bed.
- lt's all over.
- Don't upset yourself.
- l want to go beddy-bye.
- You're still you, I'm still me.
- My career is over.
- There's wars you haven't thought of.
- This war was supposed to end all wars.
- And it will.
- The ultimate war.
Rock-a-bye Captain in the crow's nest
There must be a way to get at him, Smee, to get even with him... to get him where it really would hurt.
There must be something I haven't thought of.
Where is he vulnerable?
Don't let's have any more of this talk about doin' away with yourself.
I mean, what would the world be like without Captain Hook?
Indeed.
Good form, Smee.
What would the world be like without Captain Hook?
- There you go.
- l'm ready for my nightcap.
Abso-floggin'-lutely.
I think a bit of skulduggery would do you good.
Take your mind off this Pan business.
First thing tomorrow morning, we'll shoot some Indians out of Long Tom.
I'm tired of killing Indians and Lost Boys. I've killed them most of my life.
I want to kill Peter Pan.
I want to kill him!
Give me the power to kill him.
Oh, dear.
I've just had an apostrophe.
I think you mean an epiphany.
Lightning has just struck my brain.
Well, that must hurt.
- Pan's kids.
- What about them?
- You could make 'em like you.
- Say what?
- We could make the buggers love you.
- No, Smee.
No little children love me.
- Captain, that is the point.
- What do you mean?
That is the ultimate revenge.
- What is?
- Pan's kids in love with Hook.
- What are you getting on about?
- lt's the ultimate payback.
- What is?
- lmagine Pan's puss...
- Yes?
- when he faces you... and his kids standing' beside you... ready to fight for the sleaziest sleaze of the Seven Seas, Captain James Hook.
ready to fight for the sleaziest sleaze of the Seven Seas, Captain James Hook.
- Captain, it's beautiful.
- Yes, I see.
Don't worry about that, Captain.
Thank you.
You know, Smee, I like it!
Oh, Smee, what a superb idea I've just had!
Tomorrow I'll make Pan's brats love me.
Oh, Peter Pan will fly again.
He'll remember how.
And if he doesn't, those dirty Lost Boys will jog his memory.
Yes, you'll see.
He'll crow, he'll fight, he'll fly... and then, he'll die.
Pick 'em up Move 'em down
Pick 'em on up Move 'em on down
Ain't no time to celebrate
You are old and overweight
Gotta lose a million pounds
- Get your fat butt off the ground
- Reach on down and touch your toes
Reach on down and touch your toes
How long since you looked at those

Swing your arms around your back

Go easy on me.
I'm a beginner.
Low!
High!
Fight, Gramps.
Give it your best shot.
Rufio's only trying to help.
Listen, learn.
Okay.
Ready?
I don't want to hurt you.
- Watch it.
He don't have armor on.
- Be bangerang, old man.
What are you doing?
How does this help me get my kids back?
What do I have to do next?
Next: time to fly.
Just think happy thoughts.
Peter, think happy thoughts.
All you need is one happy thought.
One happy thought will make you fly.
I got it!
Not being in this slingshot would make me very happy!
Not being in this slingshot would make me very happy!
He's goin' up!
He's comin' down !
Now pay attention, class.
We have a lot to go over.
Lesson one:
Why parents hate their children.
Lesson one:
Why parents hate their children.
Anyone?
Doesn't Mommy read to us every night?
You, the cute little urchin in the front row.
You, the cute little urchin in the front row.
Won't you share your thoughts with the whole class?
Won't you share your thoughts with the whole class?
I said Mommy reads to us every night... because she loves us very much.
Loves you?
Isn't that the--
The "L" word, Captain.
Oh, yes.
No, child.
I think your mother reads to you every night... in order to stupefy you to sleep.
So that she and Daddy can sit down for three measly minutes without you... and your mindless, inexhaustible... unstoppable, repetitive and nagging demands.
"He took my toy." "She hit my bear."
"l want to potty." "l want a cookie."
"l want to stay up." "l want, I want."
"Me, me, me."
"Mine, mine, mine."
"Now, now, now."
Can't you understand, child?
- They tell you stories to shut you up.
- And conk you out.
That's not true, Jack.
You're a liar!
Lie?
Me?
Never.
The truth is far too much fun.
Oh, my child, before you were born... your parents would stay up all night together just to see the sunrise.
Don't be frightened.
Maggie, before you were born, they were happier.
Maggie, before you were born, they were happier.
They were free.
You're a bad man.
Flunk the maggot.
Abso-floggin'-lutely.
An "F"?
- He gave me an "F"!
- Jack.
Your father went to your sister's school play, did he not?
But did he go to your baseball game?
How'd you know about that?
He missed the most important game... on what might have been the most important day of your young life.
on what might have been the most important day of your young life.
- l wanna tear your hook off!
- Easy.
I hate you, Mr. Hook!
What did I tell you, Smee?
No little children love me.
'Course they do.
Come on, you.
You're depressing' the captain.
Jack, you listen to me.
Never let him make you forget.
- Never forget Mommy and Daddy!
- Maggie.
Think of a way to run home!
- Run home!
- Run home?
You are home.
Right?
Oh, yeah.
No, no.
We don't use them.
- Why do you have them?
- So we don't have to use them.
Don't crowd me!
Come on, Thud Butt!
- Everybody say grace.
- Bless this, Lord--
Grace!
All my favorite Never-foods.
Yams, mammee apples and banana squash.
Wash it down with calabash and poe-poe.
Can you blow on this?
Thank you.
This is good.
Are you eating that?
No.
Please.
Eat.
What's the deal?
Where's the real food?
If you can't imagine yourself being Peter Pan, you won't be him, so eat up!
Eat what?
There's nothing here.
Gandhi ate more than this.
This used to be your favorite game.
Forget the games. I want real food.
I want steak, eggs, coffee--
You can't!
Eat your heart out, you crinkled, wrinkled fat-bag!
You can't!
Eat your heart out, you crinkled, wrinkled fat-bag!
- You're very ill-mannered.
- You're a slug-eating worm.
- You can do better than that.
- You're encouraging them.
Yeah, show me your fastball, dust-brain.
You paunchy, sag-bottomed puke pot!
Bangerang, Rufio!
You are a very poor role model for these kids.
Do you know that?
I bet you don't have a fourth-grade reading level.
- Hemorrhoidal suck-navel.
- Maybe a fifth-grade reading level.
Boil-dripping, beef-fart-sniffing
Bangerang, Rufio!
Someone has a severe ca-ca mouth.
You are a fart factory... slug-slimed sack of rat guts and cat vomit... cheesy, scab-picked, pimple-squeezing finger bandage.
A week-old maggot burger with everything on it... and flies on the side!
- Substitute chemistry teacher.
- Rufio, hit him back.
Mung tongue.
- Math tutor.
- Pinhead.
- Prison barber.
- Mother lover.
- Nearsighted gynecologist.
- ln your face, camel cake!
- ln your rear, cow derriere.
- Lying, crying, spying ultra-pig!
You lewd, crude, rude bag-of-prechewed-food dude.
Bangerang, Peter!
You-
- You man!
Stupid, stupid man!
If I'm a maggot burger, why don't you just eat me?
You two-toned, zebra-headed, slime-coated... pimple-farmin', paramecium brain, munching' on your own mucus... suffering from Peter Pan envy!
What's a paramecium brain?
I'll tell you what a paramecium is.
That's a paramecium!
It's a one-celled critter with no brain that can't fly!
Don't mess with me, man.
I'm a lawyer!
Banning.
Banning.
Rufio!
Rufio!
Banning is bangerang!
Oh, Rufio, why don't you just go suck on a dead dog's nose?
Oh, Rufio, why don't you just go suck on a dead dog's nose?
- You're doing it.
- Doing what?
Using your imagination, Peter.
You're playing with us, Peter.
You're doing it.
Drink your poe-poe, Peter.
How is it?
Bangerang.
Catch !
Hey, Pockets, catch!
Oh, Don't Ask.
Bangerang!
Hey, Pan the Man, catch this!
- Peter, look out!
- Watch out!
Bangerang.
Peter, can I talk to you?
Sure, Thud.
I remember Tootles.
- You do?
- He was lost too.
How could you know Tootles?
He was a Lost Boy.
These are his marbles.
These are his happy thoughts.
- He really did lose his marbles.
- Yeah, he lost 'em good.
- Peter, you know what?
- What?
My happy thought will help you.
What's your happy thought, Thud?
Mine's my mother.
Do you remember your mother, Peter?
Wish I could.
Listen.
At night when I'm alone
At night when I'm alone I lie awake and wonder
My mom sang that song.
My young Jack, tell me about the game of baseball. I can't remember.
My young Jack, tell me about the game of baseball. I can't remember.
Are the mates standin' or are they on horseback?
The stars are all my friends
The stars are all my friends
Till the nighttime ends
So I know I'm not alone
So I know I'm not alone
When I'm here
On my own lsn't that a wonder isn't that a wonder
When you're alone
When you're alone
You're not alone
Not really alone
Not really alone
Good night, Neverland!
What is it?
I hear it again.
Smee, is that crocodile back from the dead?
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
is that the clock?
You killed that croc years ago, Captain.
We smash every clock we find.
The little elf didn't know any better.
To the museum at once.
Shine 'em up!
Put a fresh coat of varnish on your peg right here!
Shine 'em up!
Put a fresh coat of varnish on your peg right here!
Treasure maps!
Authentic treasure maps!
Broken clocks.
Each one ticked its last tock, and now all is well.
Each one ticked its last tock, and now all is well.
- Just listen.
- l don't hear anything.
I know!
Good form.
Exactly.
Jack, you see this?
Come over here.
You can take it.
This is Barbecue's very own bedside clock.
He was quite an infamous pirate.
I smashed this clock immediately after I gutted him.
And his ship made such a pretty bonfire on the waves.
What is that... I hear?
A ticking!
Smee, stop it!
Stop the ticking!
Stop it!
Stop that tick!
There's no ticking' here.
There's nothin' left to tick.
Oh, my God.
This is for the ticking that might have been.
This is for the ticking that might have been.
- Abso-floggin'-lutely!
- Get his father's watch.
Go on.
You know you want to.
Give it a try.
Go on.
This is for... never letting me blow bubbles in my chocolate milk!
- Yes!
- Good form!
Bravo!
Here you go.
Isn't that wonderful?
This is for never letting me jump on my own bed.
Make time stand still, laddie.
For always making promises and breaking them.
For never doing anything with me.
For a father who's never there, Jack.
Jack, for a father who didn't save you on the ship.
He wouldn't save us.
Who couldn't save you, Jack.
He-
- He wouldn't.
He didn't even try.
He was there and we were there, and he wouldn't try.
Jack, he will try.
And the question will be... when the time comes, do you want to be saved?
Don't you answer now.
Now it's time to be whatever you want to be.
Put behind you any thoughts of home... that place of broken promises.
That what?
Have I ever made a promise, Jack... I have not kept?
Have I, son?
Come on.
Let's go.
I don't like this game.
Steal Hook's hook as fast as you can.
It'll make you proud.
Then you'll crow like Pan.
Confound it, Druscilla, glove me.
The game is about to start.
I need my bubbly.
Give me my bubbly.
Steal Hook's hook, then crow.
Jackie, boy!
This is for all the games your daddy missed.
Hook would never miss your games, son.
You're almost there.
Just take it.
- What's he looking at?
- You're this close.
What's the matter?
It's right there.
Grab it.
Come on, Jack.
And-a-one... and-a-two, and a toodle-loodle-loo!
Strike!
Wait for the good pitches.
Jack, Jack, he's our man!
If he can't do it, nobody can !
He's stealing second!
Stop it!
We're playing this game according to Master Jack's rules.
Bad form.
Sit down now.
Let's resume the game.
Very violent sport, isn't it, baseball?
Run home, Jack!
Run home, Jack!
"Run home, Jack."
Smee!
No!
They've got it backwards!
Tell them to turn it around!
Maggie?
Switch !
Home run, Jack!
Home run, Jack.
He can't hit the curve.
My Jack!
My Jack.
You did it!
Hoist him up!
That's my boy!
You did it, son!
Two, four, six, eight!
Who do we appreciate?
Jack!
Jack!
Gotta fly.
Happy thought.
One great big happy thought.
Less is more.
I can!
"Tootles, Wendy...
John, Michael, Peter."
Be careful, Peter.
You're a lot taller than you used to be.
Well, say something.
Do you like my dress?
You look beautiful.
- What's the occasion?
- You are.
It's a "welcome home" party.
- What happened here?
- Hook.
Burnt it when you didn't come back.
Kiss.
Wendy.
This is Wendy's house.
Noodles and Nibs built it for her.
I remember.
- Wendy used to sit in that chair.
- Yes.
But it wasn't there.
It was here.
We used to sit here while she'd darn socks... and tell us stories.
She slept here.
Tink, your apartment was right here.
Yes.
Little Michael had his basket bed right here.
John.
Taddy.
My Taddy.
Mother used to put him in the pram to keep me company.
I remember my mother.
I remember her.
You can be sure of very fine schools indeed.
First he will attend Whitehall, then Oxford...
First he will attend Whitehall, then Oxford... and of course, after graduation... he will prepare for a judgeship in the highest court... making time for marriage and family... and all of that, just like his father.
Isn't that what grown-ups want for their children?
I was afraid because I didn't want to grow up... because everybody who grows up has to die someday.
So I ran away.
Tink... you came and you saved me.
You brought me to Neverland.
You taught me to fly.
But I was still a little boy... and I missed my mother... so I decided to fly home to my very own window.
But it was shut.
They'd forgotten about me.
I found other windows to visit... ones that weren't shut closed on me.
That's how I met Wendy.
I chased my shadow in her nursery.
I expected my shadow and I would join together like drops of water.
Boy.
Why are you crying?
What's your name?
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.
What's yours?
I came back many times for Wendy, always in the spring.
And Wendy kept getting older... and older... and then I came back the last time.
Peter, I can't come with you.
I've forgotten how to fly.
I'm old, Peter.
Ever so much more than 20.
- l grew up a long time ago.
- No!
No!
- You promised.
- l have children of my own now.
They have children of their own.
That's my grandchild, Moira, asleep in the bed.
That's my grandchild, Moira, asleep in the bed.
When I saw her lying there sleeping... that moment, something changed in me forever.
I shall give her a kiss.
No, Peter.
No buttons.
No thimbles.
I couldn't bear Moira's heartbreak when she finds she can't keep you.
I mean a real kiss.
I can see why you have trouble finding a happy thought.
So many sad memories, Peter.
Bye, Taddy.
Not Taddy.
Daddy.
Daddy!
Peter, you're a daddy.
Hi, Jack.
I know why I came back.
I know why I grew up.
I wanted to be a father.
I'm a daddy.
My happy thought.
I got it.
I found it!
I lost it.
Just hold that happy thought, Peter!
Peter Pan!
Pan.
He's back!
Play!
You are the Pan.
You can fly, you can fight and you can crow.
You can fly, you can fight and you can crow.
Tink, you in there?
- Are you sad?
- l'm neither.
Please go away.
Oh, you're sick.
Maybe you need a Band-Aid or a thermometer.
Thermometer'd make it all better.
That's how Nibs made Wendy better.
- No, Peter, it's not about that.
- Oh, yes it is.
Nibs put the thermometer in her mouth.
Got all better.
Don't we have the greatest adventures?
Do you remember your next great adventure to save your kids, Peter?
Kids?
Peter Pan's got kids?
Why are you in Neverland?
Easy.
To always be a little boy and have fun.
I like this game.
Ask me another one.
Oh, dear me!
I did it.
Tink, look what happened.
You broke your house.
You're humongous.
This is the only wish I ever wished for myself.
Peter, this is the biggest feeling I've ever felt.
This is the biggest feeling I've ever had... and this is the first time I've been big enough to have it.
Peter, I want to give you a kiss.
No. I mean a real kiss.
I love you, Peter Pan.
- l love--
- Yes?
- Her.
- Her who?
More.
Moira!
I love Moira... and Jack and Maggie.
Jack and Maggie.
I have a plan.
Come on.
You gotta come.
When it's all over, you'll leave and never come back again.
What are you staring at, Peter?
Save them.
Go save them.
You silly ass.
Go.
You know, Jack, it's a very special time when a pirate gets his first earring.
You know, Jack, it's a very special time when a pirate gets his first earring.
Such a very, very beautiful feeling.
It's like the first time you run someone through with your blade.
Now, Jack, I'm going to ask you to bend your head ever so slightly.
Now, Jack, I'm going to ask you to bend your head ever so slightly.
A little more.
That's it.
And brace yourself, lad... because this is really going to hurt.
because this is really going to hurt.
Smee, what is that?
Who is that, Captain?
It's Peter Pan.
Has it been three days?
'Tis true, Peter.
Time does fly.
And so do you, I see.
How did you ever manage to fit into those smashing tights again, Peter?
How did you ever manage to fit into those smashing tights again, Peter?
Hand over my son now, and you and your men may go free.
Why don't you ask the lad yourself?
Jack, someone to see you, son.
Jack, give me your hand.
We're going home.
I am home.
Good form.
You see, Peter, he is my son.
He loves me dearly and I'm prepared to fight dearly for him.
He loves me dearly and I'm prepared to fight dearly for him.
I've waited long to shake your hand with this.
Peter Pan, prepare to meet thy doom.
Dark and sinister man, have at thee.
Don't you love it, laddie?
Once you shed blood and dole out cruelty, it's hard to stop.
It's a pirate's life, my lad!
-Don't I know him, Captain?
-No.
You've never seen him in your life.
You won't believe this, but I've found my happy thought.
It took me three days to find it, but guess what happened when I did?
Up I went.
You know what my happy thought was?
It was you.
That's my dad, but he hates to fly.
Bangerang!
Bangerang!
Call out the village militia!
We'll need every last man!
If there's anybody not fighting, get here quick!
If there's anybody not fighting, get here quick!
Form ranks!
Form ranks!
Get ready to show 'em the white light we're made of, boys!
Remember the fires from hell that forged you !
Charge!
Now!
- Me eyes!
- l'm blind!
We'll show you who's chicken!
Watch this!
Smee, do something intelligent.
Smee!
Smee!
What about Smee?
What about Smee?
Smee's me.
What about me?
Thudball !
Fire!
Gangway!
Look out below!
Help!
Somebody, help!
Take it!
Lost Boys, down!
My eyes!
It's time for Smee.
Where do you think you're going?
Get away from that window!
Hook!
Rufio.
The old man is mine.
Jack!
Save me!
My Maggie.
Jack!
- Wait.
Ain't you--
- Peter Pan.
- Come on.
- Daddy!
Peter Pan's my... dad?
- Maggie!
- Get it off me!
I'll never lose you again.
Lost Boys, we got 'em on the run !
Bangerang!
Here comes Pan!
Looky, looky, I got Hooky.
Hook!
No!
- Do you know what I wish?
- What?
I wish I had a dad...
like you.
I wish I had a dad...
like you.
Oh, Dad, I'm sorry.
Are you ready for me, Peter?
Come on.
Humor the Hook.
Dad?
I wanna go home.
What are you talking about?
You are home.
Where are you going?
Lost Boys!
Victory banquet!
Peter!
Where are you going?
Come back here and fight me!
I'll find you wherever you are.
Do you hear me?
Bad form, Peter!
Come back!
You need a mother very, very badly!
Smee, follow me.
Stairs.
Just movin' your personals somewhere safer.
I swear to you, wherever you go, wherever you are... I vow there will always be daggers bearing notes signed "James Hook."
I vow there will always be daggers bearing notes signed "James Hook."
They will be flung at the doors of your children's children's children.
They will be flung at the doors of your children's children's children.
Do you hear me?
What do you want, old man?
- Just you.
- You got me, James Hook.
Pan the Avenger is back.
And the Hook is waiting, Peter Pan.
Put up your swords.
It's Hook or me this time.
- Prepare to die, Peter.
- To die would be a great adventure.
Death is the only adventure you have left.
- l remember you being a lot bigger.
- To a ten-year-old, I'm huge.
No pain, no gain, James.
Pan!
Good form, old man.
You know you're not really Peter Pan, don't you?
This is only a dream.
When you wake up, you'll just be Peter Banning... a cold, selfish man who drinks too much, is obsessed with success... and runs and hides from his wife and children.
- l believe in you.
- l believe in you.
I believe in you, Peter.
I believe in you.
You are the Pan.
You're Peter Pan.
I believe in you...
Peter Pan.
- Bad form!
- Stop!
Now we end this.
You blackguard!
Hello.
Tick-tock, tick-tock, Hook's afraid of an ordinary clock.
I think not. I think James Hook's afraid of time ticking away!
Good form, Peter.
I am fallen.
Give me my dignity.
You took my hand.
You owe me something.
You killed Rufio, you kidnapped my children.
You deserve to die.
You killed Rufio, you kidnapped my children.
You deserve to die.
Strike, Peter Pan.
Strike true.
Daddy... let's go home, please?
He's just a mean old man without a mommy.
Yeah, Dad.
Let's go.
He can't hurt us anymore.
Bless you, child.
Good form, Jack.
After all, what would the world be like without...
Captain Hook?
I want you to take your ship and go.
And I never want to see your face in Neverland again.
- Look out!
- Fools!
James Hook is Neverland!
Whenever children read, it will say...
"Thus perished Peter Pan."
What's happening?
What is happening?
I want my mommy!
Hook's gone.
Bangerang!
No more Hook!
No more Hook!
Hooray for Pan the Man !
What's wrong, Peter?
I can't stay and play.
I've done what I came to do and now I have to go back.
No, Peter, please.
Tink, make my kids glow.
Jack, Maggie... all you have to do is think one happy thought, and you'll fly like me.
all you have to do is think one happy thought, and you'll fly like me.
Mommy!
My dad...
Peter Pan.
Tink, you know the way.
I'll be just behind you.
Don't leave us, Peter, and don't say good-bye.
What's good-bye?
It's going away.
That's what it is.
Forgetting about us all over again.
You're all my Lost Boys.
I'll never forget you.
Never.
So who do I leave in charge?
I want you to take care of everyone who's smaller than you.
Okay.
Then who do I look after?
Neverbugs.
Little ones.
That was a great game.
Thank you for believing.
I know her.
She looks like an angel.
Let's not wake her yet.
Oh, my dear child.
Have you been up all night?
Oh, my dear child.
Have you been up all night?
I see them in their beds so often in my dreams... when I wake up, they're still there.
Mommy!
Tink.
Hello.
Havin' trouble with the missus?
You will have by the time you get home.
Say it, Peter.
Say it and mean it.
I believe in fairies.
You know that place between asleep and awake?
That place where you still remember dreaming?
That's where l'll always love you...
Peter Pan.
That's where l'll be waiting.
Nana!
Oh, give us a kiss.
Come here, you drool machine.
Maggie, Moira, Jack!
Brad, hi!
You've been holding this long?
I'm incredible.
Yeah.
Neverland.
Lost Boys.
Jim Hook, duel to the death.
I'll fill you in later.
I'd love to chat, but I gotta climb a drainpipe right now.
I'd love to chat, but I gotta climb a drainpipe right now.
Why?
'Cause I ran out of fairy dust.
If not, I would've flown up.
"Why?"
- Mom, I fought pirates!
- You would've loved it there!
Maggie, Moira, Jack!
Granny Wendy!
Let me in.
Please.
Excuse me.
Do you have an appointment?
What did I tell you about this window?
Always keep it open !
Never, ever, ever close it!
I have to take this.
Brad, have you ever wondered what it's like to feel the exhilaration of flying?
Brad, have you ever wondered what it's like to feel the exhilaration of flying?
Feel this.
Where have you been?
- Fly me, Daddy!
- Anytime, Maggie!
To infinity and back again.
Hello, Peter.
I missed the adventure again, didn't I?
I think these belong to you.
Look!
See!
Look!
I didn't lose my marbles after all!
Wendy, look!
I didn't lose my marbles after all!
Hello, boy.
Hello, Wendy lady.
Give us a squdge.
Boy, why are you crying?
I don't know.
A tear for every happy thought.
- One for me?
- One for me?
And one for me!
Seize the day!
So, your adventures are over.
Oh, no.
To live--
To live would be an awfully big adventure.
Boy, why are you crying?
I was crying because I couldn't get my shadow to stick.
Besides, I wasn't crying.
"l shall sew it on for you, my little man. lt may hurt a little."
I shall sew it on for you, my little man.
It may hurt a little.
What is your name?
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.
- What's yours?
- Peter Pan.
Watch your daughter.
She's wonderful.
- Yeah.
- She's stealing the show.
I think it's perfectly sweet of you.
- Louder!
- l think it's perfectly sweet of you.
- Louder!
- l think it's perfectly sweet of you.
I shall give you a kiss if you like.
Don't you know what a kiss is?
I shall once you give one to me.
Now I shall give you a kiss.
I don't ever want to become a man.
Yuck!
I always want to be a little boy and to have fun.
We wanna be like Peter Pan
We don't wanna grow up
Brad.
I'm at my daughter's play.
Then when it's time to be a man
We're not gonna show up lt's impossible.
I'm on a plane to London tomorrow night with my family.
A children's hospital--
A children's hospital is dedicating an entire wing to Granny Wendy.
- Peter, you're missing it.
- All right.
Want a meeting tomorrow, a.m.?
Dad, my game.
You promised.
Listen, it's my son's big game.
Last game of the season, Santa Series.
I gotta be there. I promised.
So, we'll make it a short meeting.
I'll be there.
My word is my bond.
We never, never, never, never
Never, ever wanna grow up Yuck
Strike three, you're out!
Jack!
Come on, Blue Jays!
Where is your father?
He's missing it.
Daddy'll be here.
He promised.
- Jerry, Jack--
- Jim.
I said that.
Take the video camera, go to the game, film what I miss.
-Can I say something?
-Mr.
Banning, here's the tribute speech.
- On cards?
- Yes, sir.
- Number those.
Who wrote it?
- Ned Miller.
I loved his annual report.
Read it back to me.
"Lord Whitehall, honored guests, for the past 70 years...
- the Granny Wendy we honor tonight...
- That's nice.
has given hope and care and life to hundreds of homeless children."
Great.
Very personal.
Mommy, where is Daddy?
- My briefcase--
- Banning.
Well, gotta fly.
Don't worry.
More people crash in cars than on planes.
It's safer to fly than crossing the street.
Don't look down.
Well, if it's your time to go, it's your time to go.
And remember, don't let your arms get tired!
What if it's the pilot's time to go?
Come on, keep us alive, Banning!
- Okay, come on!
- Hi, Mrs. Banning!
I'm from the office.
- Which one's your son?
- He's up to bat.
Thank you.
Don't look at me.
Focus!
Stay focused.
Come on, Jack.
One time.
Please not a curve ball.
Mama wants a new pair of shoes.
Drive me home, Jack!
That's a game.
Two, four, six, eight Who do we appreciate
Blue Jays
Yeah, Brad.
That's real good.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Please do not allow this minor turbulence to disturb you.
For now, please sit back and relax, and enjoy the remainder of the flight.
Thank you.
- Look what Jack drew.
- That's very nice, dear.
- What's that?
- Fire.
Fire?
Really?
- ls that our plane?
- Yep.
- Who are all these people?
- That's Jack, that's me... that's Mom, and that's you.
Where's my parachute?
I'm not gonna make it to my next birthday.
You're not gonna die without a phone and fax machine.
I'm halfway there.
I got the phone in the briefcase.
Talk to him.
Why didn't I have a parachute, Jackie?
Take a wild guess.
- Jackie--
- Jack.
Will you stop that?
You can break a window.
They're double-layered.
You can't break them.
Give me that.
You're afraid you're gonna get sucked out.
I'm not afraid of being sucked out.
Yes, you are.
You're afraid you're going to be sucked out.
Just stop.
Jack, next season I'm coming to six games. I promise.
Yeah, be sure to buy enough videotape.
Hey, Jack.
My word is my bond.
Yeah, junk bonds.
What the hell's the matter with you?
When will you stop acting like a child?
I am a child.
Grow up.
It's been a long time.
Let's have fun, Peter.
London's a magical place for children.
Well, it was for us.
It's gotten very expensive.
Jack, don't.
You could put someone's eye out.
Maggie.
- Peter, it's number 14.
- Oh, 14.
Okay.
Now, what do you say to Granny Wendy? "How do you do?"
Jack, get down from there.
You'll break your neck.
Be careful.
is Granny Wendy the real Wendy from my play?
- Not really.
- Sort of.
Don't be a sloucher.
Take that gum out of your mouth.
It's time to look our best.
Remember, dears:
First impressions are the most important.
Shoes tied, shirt tucked.
Give me this.
All right.
Remember, you're in England, land of good manners.
- Uncle Tootles.
- lt's snowing!
Look at these adorable children!
It's good to see you, Libby, Linda-
- Lisa!
- Liza.
- l said that.
Moira, how are you?
Look at the size of the-- Look at you, such a big, sweet thing.
- Granny Wendy will be right down.
- She's upstairs?
Oh, good.
No baseball.
- Did you do this for us?
- Yes, I did.
- Thank you.
- l've been cooking all week.
What have you been cooking?
Mince pies?
Brandy snaps?
Oh, Peter, look at this.
- Who's that?
- lt's you.
- Was I ever that young?
- Yes.
- What's gotten into you?
- Oh, this house has gotten to me.
Some of those things I was when I was young have never left me.
Oh, thank God, Peter.
We were children in these rooms.
Lost, lost, lost.
Lost what?
I've lost my marbles.
- Okay.
Lisa?
- Liza.
Liza. I thought he was supposed to be in a home.
It broke Wendy's heart.
After all, Tootles is Wendy's first orphan.
- Which is which?
- The large bag is mine... that one's Moira's, and the two smaller ones are the children's.
Hello, boy.
Hello, Wendy.
I told you, Gran, I'd get him here, by hook or by crook.
Sorry it's been so long between visits.
It's been ten years between visits, but never mind.
Come and give me a squdge.
And this lovely lady can't-- it can't be Maggie.
Yes, it can.
And know what, Great-Grandma?
- l just played you at school.
- And don't you just look the part.
Oh, can this giant be Jack?
How much you've grown in a year.
Oh, can this giant be Jack?
How much you've grown in a year.
I'm supposed to tell you about congratulations for opening the... I'm supposed to tell you about congratulations for opening the... orphan hospital, and how great the dedication is.
orphan hospital, and how great the dedication is.
And-
- Yeah.
- Thank you so very much.
- You're welcome.
Now, there is one rule I insist be obeyed while you are in my house.
Now, there is one rule I insist be obeyed while you are in my house.
No growing up.
Stop this very instant... and that includes you, Mr. Chairman of the Board Banning.
Sorry.
Too late, Gran.
And what is so terribly important about your terribly important business?
And what is so terribly important about your terribly important business?
Well, you see, when a big company's in trouble, Dad sails in.
- And if there's any resistance, Dad--
- He's exaggerating.
I'm still into mergers and acquisitions and I'm dabbling into land development.
I'm still into mergers and acquisitions and I'm dabbling into land development.
Any resistance, and he blows them out of the water.
So, Peter, you've become a pirate.
So, Peter, you've become a pirate.
- Peter!
- What?
Brad's on the line.
He says it's urgent.
- Peter, do you like my dress?
- Great, Gran.
Real nice.
Thanks.
Brad.
Good news?
What?
What Sierra Club report?
I thought we had these guys.
He's trying to suck my blood, and he drools all over my neck.
- What did they find?
- Peter, that's a portable phone.
- A Cozy Blue Owl?
- There's nine other room in the house.
Well, listen.
Tell them there've always been casualties of evolution.
Ask them if anybody misses the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
I do.
Boy, do I ever.
Wow.
Are you kidding?
Wait a minute.
A ten-inch owl has a 50-mile mating radius?
Wait a minute.
A ten-inch owl has a 50-mile mating radius?
Why don't they just fornicate someplace else?
A $5 billion deal falling apart because of this?
A $5 billion deal falling apart because of this?
Why doesn't somebody just shoot me in the head?
Bang!
Bang!
- Will everybody just shut up!
- l'm sorry.
Leave me alone for one moment.
Moira, get them outta here.
I'm on the phone call of my life.
Come on, Jack.
Out.
Come with me.
I'll show you the window where your father and I used to blow out the stars.
I never should have come. I should have stayed till the deal was done.
You haven't been here for ten years, though Granny asked you every year.
- l've been busy.
- You promised the kids some real time.
- l just got here.
- You've done nothing but yell at them.
- That's not true.
- How many more broken promises, Peter?
I'm sorry.
It's Brad.
I gotta take this call.
I gotta fix this.
No.
You've got to fix your family first.
Peter, hello.
Are you there?
What- l'm sorry about your deal.
- You hated the deal.
I hated the deal, but I'm sorry you feel so badly about it.
Your children love you.
They want to play with you.
How long do you think that lasts?
Soon Jack may not even want you to come to his games.
We have a few special years with our children... when they're the ones that want us around.
After that, you're going to be running after them for a bit of attention.
It's so fast, Peter.
It's a few years, and then it's over.
And you are not being careful.
And you are missing it.
Peter, where are you?
All children, except one, grow up.
All children, except one, grow up.
You know where fairies come from, don't you, Maggie?
"When the first baby laughed for the first time... the laugh broke into a thousand pieces... and they all went skipping about.
That was the beginning of fairies."
And look.
I'm Wendy.
Or was, a long time ago.
But Jack says you're not the really real Wendy.
But Jack says you're not the really real Wendy.
Ah, well, you see where Jack is?
Well, that is the same window, and this is the same room... where we made up stories about Peter and Neverland and scary old Captain Hook.
where we made up stories about Peter and Neverland and scary old Captain Hook.
And do you know, Mr. Barrie-- well, Sir James-- our neighbor...
And do you know, Mr. Barrie-- well, Sir James-- our neighbor... he loved our stories so much that he wrote them all down in a book... oh, dear me, 80 years ago.
You're really old.
That's very true.
I'm sorry I have to break this up, but I have to steal Granny Wendy... or she'll be late for the most important event of her life.
Oh, dear.
Daddy, I made something for you.
You're gonna love this.
It's a hug.
Next time you fly you won't have to be scared.
She's made you a parachute.
That's very clever, dear.
Jack, get away from there.
What have I told you about open windows?
Keep this window closed.
I've told you this a hundred times.
- Do we have open windows at home?
- No, they've all got bars on them.
Come on, into bed.
Who took my baseball?
That mean, scary man at the window stole it.
- There's no scary man.
- But he says he's a window washer.
- There's no scary man.
- But he says he's a window washer.
- What is this?
- This is a baseball glove.
You can catch things with it, take hot things out of the oven... or hit your sister with it.
Tootles made it for me.
- lt smells nice.
- lt's paper, honey.
Night.
Hey, Jack.
Faker.
Jack, you're in charge now.
This is my very special watch so you can keep track of the time.
Don't go out, Mom, please.
Good night.
Dear night lights, protect my sleeping babes.
Burn clear and steadfast tonight.
I read recently that they're now using lawyers instead of rats... for scientific experiments.
They do this for two reasons.
One, the scientists become less attached to the lawyers.
And two, there are certain things that even rats won't do.
I want to thank the board of trustees of the Great Ormond Street Hospital... for having me here this evening, and beg your forgiveness... because normally I'm used to addressing shareholders.
We don't know each other, and I doubt that we have very much in common...
We don't know each other, and I doubt that we have very much in common... except this wonderful woman, Wendy Angela Darling.
Granny Wendy brought me in from the cold.
She taught me to read and write.
She even found people to be my parents and adopt me.
She's loved so many children... just so efforlet-- effors-- effortlessly.
just so efforlet-- effors-- effortlessly.
That's her achievement.
Many of you here tonight were once lost children... but Granny Wendy found parents and homes for each of you... and saved you-- that's her miracle.
And I know that if you could stand now you would express... much better than I have your feelings of... gratitude... appreciation... and warm feelings... for this wonderful woman.
I guess we do have something in common.
We're orphans.
Hook!
Are you all right?
Thank you, Nigel-
- Norman?
- Neville, sir.
- Neville. ls that English?
Merry Christmas.
- l was proud of you.
- Really?
It was a beautiful speech.
Hello?
My God.
The children.
Maggie?
Jack, answer me!
The wind came up, the door closed on me... and the children were screaming.
The window.
"Dear Peter, your presence is required at the request of your children."
"Kindest personal regards, JAS Hook...
"Kindest personal regards, JAS Hook...
Captain."
Have to fly.
Have to fight.
Have to crow.
Have to save Maggie.
Have to save Jack.
Hook is back.
Who?
Gran?
Well, the lab boys can analyze this little lot.
Mr. and Mrs. Banning, we've wired the phones, and two men will stay outside.
Mr. and Mrs. Banning, we've wired the phones, and two men will stay outside.
Of course, it is possible this whole thing is some kind of ridiculous prank.
My children are missing.
Yes, but the literary history of the family and everything suggests--
- Well, let's hope so.
- l've forgotten how to fly.
Yes, well, one does.
Good night, then, ma'am, sir.
No more happy thoughts.
Lost.
Nothing we can do.
The police will do everything--
The police can do nothing.
Oh, really?
Maybe we should call the American police.
In a crisis, we English always make a cup of tea.
Moira, would you?
- Tea?
- Of course, Gran.
Don't forget to warm the pot.
- l'll go.
Moira--
- Peter.
You stay.
Don't worry, Granny Wendy.
I wasn't going to leave.
Hand me my book, please.
It's time to tell you at last.
Tell me what?
How far back can you remember, Peter?
I remember the hospital on Great Ormond Street.
You worked with orphans, you taught me to read.
You arranged for the adoption by my American parents, Hank and Jane Banning.
You were 12-- nearly 13.
I mean before that.
There's nothing before that.
Try, Peter.
Do try.
Nothing.
You know, when I was young... no other girl held your favor the way I did.
I half expected you to alight on the church and forbid my vows... on my wedding day.
I wore a pink satin sash.
But you didn't come.
Grandma--
Yes, I was an old lady when I wrapped you in blankets... a grandmother... with my 13-year-old granddaughter asleep in the bed-
- Moira.
with my 13-year-old granddaughter asleep in the bed-
- Moira.
And when you saw her... that was when you decided not to go back to Neverland.
Where?
To Never-Neverland.
Moira!
I'm getting Moira.
- l've tried to tell you so many times--
- Maybe the tea's ready.
- l knew you'd forgotten.
- l'm not ready to deal with this now.
The stories are true, I swear to you.
I swear on everything I adore.
And now he's come back to seek his revenge.
The fight isn't over for Captain James Hook.
He wants you back.
He knows you'll follow Maggie and Jack... to the ends of the earth and beyond, and by heaven you must find a way.
to the ends of the earth and beyond, and by heaven you must find a way.
Only you can save your children.
Somehow you must go back.
You must make yourself remember.
Remember what?
Peter, don't you know who you are?
Yes, boy.
Sorry.
Parachute.
Firefly from hell!
Big damn bug!
Oh, it is you, it is!
A big you.
I guess it's not bad that you're big.
You were always bigger than me.
But now maybe this means you'll be twice as much fun.
What fun we'll have again!
What times!
What great games!
You're a little f--
Fairy.
Pixie.
And if less is more, there's no end to me, Peter Pan.
- Peter Banning.
- Pan.
Whoever you are, it's still you.
'Cause only one person has that smell.
Smell?
The smell of someone who's ridden the back of the wind, Peter.
The smell of a hundred fun summers of sleeping in trees... adventures with Indians and pirates.
Oh, remember, Peter?
The world was ours.
We could do everything or nothing.
All I had to be was anything, 'cause it was always us.
Oh, no. lt's finally happened.
I'm having a total nervous breakdown.
Oh, no. lt's finally happened.
I'm having a total nervous breakdown.
Peter, follow me and all will be well.
Or I'm dying.
I'm heading towards the white light.
I've left my body.
See, there's my house way down there.
There are my feet.
Oh, my God.
Where are we going?
- To save your children, of course.
- How do you know about my kids?
Everybody knows.
Captain Hook's got them and you've got to fight him.
Let's fly!
It is true, then.
You did grow up.
I drank poison for you.
You used to call me Tink.
- Have you forgotten everything?
- Are you in there, little bug?
I'm not a bug.
I'm a fairy.
I do not believe in fairies.
Every time someone says, "l do not believe in fairies"... somewhere there's a fairy that falls down dead.
I do not believe in fairies!
Oh, my God, I think I killed it.
Are you alive, little bug?
Look out!
Clap your hands, Peter.
It's the only way to save me.
Louder.
Louder, Peter!
Okay, I'm clapping!
Oh, God, you're alive.
All right, now.
Who am I?
You're, um--
You're a Freudian hallucination having something to do with my mother... and I don't know why you have wings, but you have very lovely legs... and you're a very nice tiny person, and what am I saying?
I don't know who my mother was, I'm an orphan, and I've never taken drugs... because I missed the '60s, I was an accountant.
Guess again.
Oh, look.
Stars.
That's right, Peter.
Second star to the right and straight on till morning.
Neverland.
What a nightmare.
Moira!
Hear ye, hear ye!
Roll out.
Roll out!
Neverbirds!
Three for a farthing.
Pies for sale.
Lovely fish !
Fresh fish!
We keep the eyes in so they'll see you through the week.
Excuse me.
is there a pay phone around here?
- That is so real.
- Peter, get back here!
Get down, get low.
Hide!
Hello.
If it ain't the Mother Inferior.
Gentlemen, I'm looking for someone.
I fancy them shiny shoes for my booty.
You can get them at Armani.
Tink, help me!
Tinkerball-
- Tinkerbun--
Don't get no blood on them boots!
They's mine!
Help me, Tinkerbell!
You pixie devil!
Oh, please don't.
I have a bad back.
Ya pixie devil !
Are you related to Mighty Mouse?
If you insist on seeing Hook and desire to be alive when you do so... do exactly what I say.
Your left arm is dead, it hangs lifeless at your side.
Lean on the crutch!
Left foot turned in.
Tilt your head and glare with your good eye.
Now crack your mouth and drool.
Now growl.
Growl !
- How are you?
- Not bad, and you?
- Not bad!
- All right!
Put your faces on, girls.
Here comes Smee!
Follow that hook!
Make way for the hook!
He's gonna love this hook!
Hook, show us the hook
Hook, give us the hook
Good morning, Neverland!
Good morning, Mr. Smee!
- Tie down the main mast, mateys...
- Aye!
'cause here he is-- the cunning king fish... the bad barracuda... a man so deep, he's almost unfathomable.
a man so deep, he's almost unfathomable.
A man so quick, he's even fast asleep.
Thank you.
Now, let's give him a very big hand, 'cause he's only got one.
I give you the steel-handed stingray...
Captain James Hook!
See how greatly the men favor you, sir?
The pewling spawn-- how I despise them.
Go get 'em, Captain !
Thank you, thank you.
Well, my stupid, sorry, parasitic sacks of entrails...
Well, my stupid, sorry, parasitic sacks of entrails... revenge is mine.
Long live the hook!
I baited that hook, and now I'm very proud to announce... we have his children.
Oh, my God.
Jack and Maggie.
Long live Hook
Finally I'm going to kill Peter Pan... that cocky boy who cut off my hand and fed it to the crocodile!
And who killed that cunning crocodile?
Who stuffed him?
Who made him into a quiet clock?
Who went into the other world and stole Pan's children?
And who didn't believe I could do it?
Who doubted me?
Who amongst us does not belong?
Someone here does not belong, a stranger amongst the loyal.
I will weed you out.
You!
Where's the carpet, Smee?
Oh, sorry, sir.
You.
That's right, you.
No, not you.
Not you.
You.
You bet against me bringing Pan back here, didn't you?
No.
Tell your captain the truth.
Oh, say it.
- l did.
- Yes, you made a boo-boo.
The Boo Box.
Not that!
Not the Boo Box!
Good.
You cannot lie to the captain!
Boo!
- Long live Hook
- Put me down !
I want my mommy!
I want my daddy!
Hello, children.
Comfy?
Cozy?
Those are my kids!
Are you okay?
Everything's going to be all right.
Get out of the way!
Daddy's here.
Hook, I want those kids, or you better get an attorney that's better than me.
- Who are you?
- Peter Banning, attorney at law.
- Those are my children.
- Those are your--
- Children.
- These are your children?
- Yes, they are.
- And you're--
- Peter.
- You're Peter?
- ls there an echo in here?
- My great and worthy opponent?
- Yes.
- No!
Smee!
Who is this impostor?
Peter-floggin'-flyin'
-Pan !
No, I'm not Peter Pan.
I am just an ordinary-- l've got a sworn affidavit by a T-Bell.
I've got his medical history, I've even got his dental records.
- Excuse me.
- You tryin' to do me out of a job?
- What's the matter with you?
- May I show you something?
- Will you let go of me?
- Release him.
- May I show you this?
- Will you shut him up?
Oh, flog off.
Just shut up.
- Captain, put these on.
- l want to see the scar.
The hypertrophy.
Here's the scar where you sliced him during the Tiger Lily incident.
- That's my appendix.
- What's this?
Fairy footprints.
He's Peter Pan or I've got a dead man's dinghy.
Fairy footprints.
He's Peter Pan or I've got a dead man's dinghy.
is it you?
My great and worthy opponent?
But it can't be.
Not this pitiful, spineless, pasty, bloated codfish I see before me.
Not this pitiful, spineless, pasty, bloated codfish I see before me.
You're not even a shadow of Peter Pan.
I think we have an obligation to clarify this Pan problem...
- This disaster.
- which must be remedied.
- Expediently, I agree.
- l want my children.
- For me the stakes can be no higher.
- For me they can have sunk no lower.
I want my war!
Blow him out of the water, Dad!
Daddy's handling this.
It's okay.
Oh, come on, Peter.
Pick up your weapon.
All right.
How much?
Hoist and raise the kiddies!
Dad, help!
I'll make you a deal, Mr. Chairman of the Board.
Fly up there and touch the outstretched fingers... of your frightened children, and I'll set them free.
I can't fly.
Explode out of there!
Stop the charade!
Free your children!
- Dad, help!
- Daddy!
- l beg your pardon?
- l have a real problem with heights.
You must be joking.
Peter Pan has a real problem with heights.
- l'm not Peter Pan.
- Dad, help!
It's okay.
Hang on, son.
I'm coming, sweetheart.
Someone give me a hand.
I already have.
Help us, Daddy!
- Come on !
- Save us, Daddy!
Save me, Daddy!
You know who you are.
What new game is this, Peter?
Fly!
Stop pretending!
Fly!
I know it's you!
Be the Pan you are.
Fly.
Fly.
Think a happy thought.
All you have to do is touch our fingers and we'll be able to go home.
All you have to do is touch our fingers and we'll be able to go home.
Touch them, Peter, and it's all been just a bad dream.
Just reach out and touch them.
Flap your arms and fly!
Reach !
Come on, Daddy.
Mommy could do it.
Smee, I don't understand.
Why doesn't he fly?
is he not Peter Pan?
Smee, I don't understand.
Why doesn't he fly?
is he not Peter Pan?
He's Peter Pan, all right, Captain.
He's just been away from Neverland for so long, his mind's been "junk-tified."
He's just been away from Neverland for so long, his mind's been "junk-tified."
He's forgotten everything.
Please don't give up.
Dad.
I wanna go home.
Gentlemen, I'm afraid I have decided... to cancel the war.
He can't fly, but he can swim!
Kill them.
Kill them all.
- Dad!
- Bring on the plank!
And I never want to hear the name "Peter Pan" again!
What about the name "Hook"?
is that how you want to be remembered?
As a bully?
Or as the great warrior who defeated a heroic Pan?
One week and I'll get him in shape, and you can have your dirty old war.
It's a trick, Captain.
Let me blast that buzzing vixen to pixie hell.
It's a trick, Captain.
Let me blast that buzzing vixen to pixie hell.
Smee.
You promised people the war of the century.
Your whole life has been building to this moment.
Mortal combat, glory, Hook versus Pan!
That is not Pan.
Two days.
Four-- bare minimum for a decent Pan.
Three.
Final offer.
Done.
And you better deliver, Miss Bell... or no amount of clapping will bring you back from where l will send you.
Hear me, men.
For reasons of good form... I've decided that the so-called Pan will return in three days... to commence the arbitrament of the sword.
Smee, translate.
In three days we're gonna have a war... a battle between good and evil, to the death.
Help me.
Snow!
Hot.
What?
Help!
Get me down !
Oh, you're alive!
Oh, get me down!
I believe!
Lost Boys, Lost Boys, wake up!
Pan's back!
Lost Boys, wake up!
That was my pillow!
Sure, yeah, I'm up.
Wake up, you sleepyheads!
Pan's back!
Who's the shrub?
Bangerang!
That ain't Peter Pan.
- He's old.
- He's fat.
Not so fat to me.
He's an old, fat grandpa man.
Rufio!
Oh, that is so dangerous.
That's enough!
Okay, mister.
All right.
The show's over now.
You put that thing away, put it down before you poke somebody's eye out.
You put that thing away, put it down before you poke somebody's eye out.
You're not old enough to shave.
What are you doing with a sword?
Flying around-- This is an insurance nightmare!
What is this, some Lord of the Flies preschool?
Where are your parents?
Who's in charge here?
No, Mr. Skunkhead with too much mousse.
You are just a punk kid.
I want to speak to a grown-up.
- All grown-ups are pirates.
- Excuse me?
We kill pirates.
I'm not a pirate.
It so happens I am a lawyer.
Kill the lawyer!
I'm not that kind of lawyer.
I've been shot!
Help!
Help me, somebody!
Boys, listen!
He married Wendy's granddaughter!
Hook has kidnapped his kids.
He's just out of shape.
We have to make him bangerang.
Why are you doing this to me?
Rufio, you're the best with a sword.
Please teach him.
We gotta make him remember.
Excuse me.
- Help me!
- Help me!
- Not you.
- Not you?
Helmets!
Oh, my.
A wall.
Stop it!
Lost Boys, stop it!
Play!
You're dead, jolly man.
He can't do those things.
He can't even play simple games.
Hook has got his kids, and I've got three days... to get him ready to fight, and I need everybody's help.
Peter Pan's gots kids?
You can't fly, fight, or crow.
So... if any of you says this here scug ain't Peter Pan, cross the line.
if any of you says this here scug ain't Peter Pan, cross the line.
Hi.
What?
Be right back.
- What?
- You are embarrassing me!
Oh, there you are, Peter.
But, Peter, you've grown up.
You promised never to grow old.
But, Peter, you've grown up.
You promised never to grow old.
His nose got real big.
Well, welcome back to Neverland, Pan the Man.
Don't listen to that stinkin' fairy and that brainless fungus!
I got Pan's sword.
I'm the Pan now.
You think this guy's gonna take it from me, Rufio?
Wait!
If Tink believes, maybe he is.
Are you gonna follow this drooler... against Capitán Hook?
What's he doin' here if he's not Peter Pan, huh?
He don't look happy here.
And who are them kids Hook's got?
- Give him a chance!
- Those are my kids.
And Hook is gonna kill them unless we do something.
Help me.
Please?
Come on!
Give him a chance!
I should claw myself with my own hook, Smee.
Not to kill Pan when I had the chance.
What have I done?
What have I done, Smee?
Agreed to a preposterous plan?
An absurd war?
Now I'm bound by my indefatigable good form to wait.
- l'll fix you a nice plate.
- Wait for what?
Whether it be three days or decades, he will always be a fat old Pan.
Whether it be three days or decades, he will always be a fat old Pan.
Oh, I hate being disappointed, Smee... and I hate living in this flawed body... and I hate living in Neverland... and I hate, I hate... I hate Peter Pan!
I hate Peter Pan!
Smee, I've just had a sublime vision.
All the jagged parts of my life have come together... to form a complete and mystical whole.
An epiphany.
A piffy what?
- My life is over.
- You mean you've lost your appetite?
Yes.
Good-bye.
Where are you going?
Are you getting dramatic?
Good-bye, Smee.
Captain, why don't we play with your island, eh?
You know, all the little injuns and soldiers and all the Lost Boys?
You know, all the little injuns and soldiers and all the Lost Boys?
No stopping me this time, Smee.
This is it.
No stopping me this time, Smee.
This is it.
Don't make a move, Smee.
Not a step.
My finger's on the trigger.
- Don't try to stop me.
- On, not again.
This is it.
Don't try to stop me this time, Smee.
Don't try to stop me this time, Smee.
Don't you dare try to stop me this time.
Try to stop me.
Don't you dare try to stop me this time.
Try to stop me.
You'd better get up off your ass.
Get over here, Smee!
- l'm comin'!
- Stop me!
This is not a joke!
I'm committing suicide!
-Don't ever frighten me like that again.
-l'm sorry.
- Are you some kind of sadist?
- l'm sorry.
How do you feel now?
- l want to die.
- Oh, now, now.
- There's no adventure here.
- You call this no adventure?
Death is the only great adventure I have left.
- Let's get you into bed.
- lt's all over.
- Don't upset yourself.
- l want to go beddy-bye.
- You're still you, I'm still me.
- My career is over.
- There's wars you haven't thought of.
- This war was supposed to end all wars.
- And it will.
- The ultimate war.
Rock-a-bye Captain in the crow's nest
There must be a way to get at him, Smee, to get even with him... to get him where it really would hurt.
There must be something I haven't thought of.
Where is he vulnerable?
Don't let's have any more of this talk about doin' away with yourself.
I mean, what would the world be like without Captain Hook?
Indeed.
Good form, Smee.
What would the world be like without Captain Hook?
- There you go.
- l'm ready for my nightcap.
Abso-floggin'-lutely.
I think a bit of skulduggery would do you good.
Take your mind off this Pan business.
First thing tomorrow morning, we'll shoot some Indians out of Long Tom.
I'm tired of killing Indians and Lost Boys. I've killed them most of my life.
I want to kill Peter Pan.
I want to kill him!
Give me the power to kill him.
Oh, dear.
I've just had an apostrophe.
I think you mean an epiphany.
Lightning has just struck my brain.
Well, that must hurt.
- Pan's kids.
- What about them?
- You could make 'em like you.
- Say what?
- We could make the buggers love you.
- No, Smee.
No little children love me.
- Captain, that is the point.
- What do you mean?
That is the ultimate revenge.
- What is?
- Pan's kids in love with Hook.
- What are you getting on about?
- lt's the ultimate payback.
- What is?
- lmagine Pan's puss...
- Yes?
- when he faces you... and his kids standing' beside you... ready to fight for the sleaziest sleaze of the Seven Seas, Captain James Hook.
ready to fight for the sleaziest sleaze of the Seven Seas, Captain James Hook.
- Captain, it's beautiful.
- Yes, I see.
Don't worry about that, Captain.
Thank you.
You know, Smee, I like it!
Oh, Smee, what a superb idea I've just had!
Tomorrow I'll make Pan's brats love me.
Oh, Peter Pan will fly again.
He'll remember how.
And if he doesn't, those dirty Lost Boys will jog his memory.
Yes, you'll see.
He'll crow, he'll fight, he'll fly... and then, he'll die.
Pick 'em up Move 'em down
Pick 'em on up Move 'em on down
Ain't no time to celebrate

Go easy on me.
I'm a beginner.
Low!
High!
Fight, Gramps.
Give it your best shot.
Rufio's only trying to help.
Listen, learn.
Okay.
Ready?
I don't want to hurt you.
- Watch it.
He don't have armor on.
- Be bangerang, old man.
What are you doing?
How does this help me get my kids back?
What do I have to do next?
Next: time to fly.
Just think happy thoughts.
Peter, think happy thoughts.
All you need is one happy thought.
One happy thought will make you fly.
I got it!
Not being in this slingshot would make me very happy!
Not being in this slingshot would make me very happy!
He's goin' up!
He's comin' down !
Now pay attention, class.
We have a lot to go over.
Lesson one:
Why parents hate their children.
Lesson one:
Why parents hate their children.
Anyone?
Doesn't Mommy read to us every night?
You, the cute little urchin in the front row.
You, the cute little urchin in the front row.
Won't you share your thoughts with the whole class?
Won't you share your thoughts with the whole class?
I said Mommy reads to us every night... because she loves us very much.
Loves you?
Isn't that the--
The "L" word, Captain.
Oh, yes.
No, child.
I think your mother reads to you every night... in order to stupefy you to sleep.
So that she and Daddy can sit down for three measly minutes without you... and your mindless, inexhaustible... unstoppable, repetitive and nagging demands.
"He took my toy." "She hit my bear."
"l want to potty." "l want a cookie."
"l want to stay up." "l want, I want."
"Me, me, me."
"Mine, mine, mine."
"Now, now, now."
Can't you understand, child?
- They tell you stories to shut you up.
- And conk you out.
That's not true, Jack.
You're a liar!
Lie?
Me?
Never.
The truth is far too much fun.
Oh, my child, before you were born... your parents would stay up all night together just to see the sunrise.
Don't be frightened.
Maggie, before you were born, they were happier.
Maggie, before you were born, they were happier.
They were free.
You're a bad man.
Flunk the maggot.
Abso-floggin'-lutely.
An "F"?
- He gave me an "F"!
- Jack.
Your father went to your sister's school play, did he not?
But did he go to your baseball game?
How'd you know about that?
He missed the most important game... on what might have been the most important day of your young life.
on what might have been the most important day of your young life.
- l wanna tear your hook off!
- Easy.
I hate you, Mr. Hook!
What did I tell you, Smee?
No little children love me.
'Course they do.
Come on, you.
You're depressing' the captain.
Jack, you listen to me.
Never let him make you forget.
- Never forget Mommy and Daddy!
- Maggie.
Think of a way to run home!
- Run home!
- Run home?
You are home.
Right?
Oh, yeah.
No, no.
We don't use them.
- Why do you have them?
- So we don't have to use them.
Don't crowd me!
Come on, Thud Butt!
- Everybody say grace.
- Bless this, Lord--
Grace!
All my favorite Never-foods.
Yams, mammee apples and banana squash.
Wash it down with calabash and poe-poe.
Can you blow on this?
Thank you.
This is good.
Are you eating that?
No.
Please.
Eat.
What's the deal?
Where's the real food?
If you can't imagine yourself being Peter Pan, you won't be him, so eat up!
Eat what?
There's nothing here.
Gandhi ate more than this.
This used to be your favorite game.
Forget the games. I want real food.
I want steak, eggs, coffee--
You can't!
Eat your heart out, you crinkled, wrinkled fat-bag!
You can't!
Eat your heart out, you crinkled, wrinkled fat-bag!
- You're very ill-mannered.
- You're a slug-eating worm.
- You can do better than that.
- You're encouraging them.
Yeah, show me your fastball, dust-brain.
You paunchy, sag-bottomed puke pot!
Bangerang, Rufio!
You are a very poor role model for these kids.
Do you know that?
I bet you don't have a fourth-grade reading level.
- Hemorrhoidal suck-navel.
- Maybe a fifth-grade reading level.
Boil-dripping, beef-fart-sniffing
Bangerang, Rufio!
Someone has a severe ca-ca mouth.
You are a fart factory... slug-slimed sack of rat guts and cat vomit... cheesy, scab-picked, pimple-squeezing finger bandage.
A week-old maggot burger with everything on it... and flies on the side!
- Substitute chemistry teacher.
- Rufio, hit him back.
Mung tongue.
- Math tutor.
- Pinhead.
- Prison barber.
- Mother lover.
- Nearsighted gynecologist.
- ln your face, camel cake!
- ln your rear, cow derriere.
- Lying, crying, spying ultra-pig!
You lewd, crude, rude bag-of-prechewed-food dude.
Bangerang, Peter!
You-
- You man!
Stupid, stupid man!
If I'm a maggot burger, why don't you just eat me?
You two-toned, zebra-headed, slime-coated... pimple-farmin', paramecium brain, munching' on your own mucus... suffering from Peter Pan envy!
What's a paramecium brain?
I'll tell you what a paramecium is.
That's a paramecium!
It's a one-celled critter with no brain that can't fly!
Don't mess with me, man.
I'm a lawyer!
Banning.
Banning.
Rufio!
Rufio!
Banning is bangerang!
Oh, Rufio, why don't you just go suck on a dead dog's nose?
Oh, Rufio, why don't you just go suck on a dead dog's nose?
- You're doing it.
- Doing what?
Using your imagination, Peter.
You're playing with us, Peter.
You're doing it.
Drink your poe-poe, Peter.
How is it?
Bangerang.
Catch !
Hey, Pockets, catch!
Oh, Don't Ask.
Bangerang!
Hey, Pan the Man, catch this!
- Peter, look out!
- Watch out!
Bangerang.
Peter, can I talk to you?
Sure, Thud.
I remember Tootles.
- You do?
- He was lost too.
How could you know Tootles?
He was a Lost Boy.
These are his marbles.
These are his happy thoughts.
- He really did lose his marbles.
- Yeah, he lost 'em good.
- Peter, you know what?
- What?
My happy thought will help you.
What's your happy thought, Thud?
Mine's my mother.
Do you remember your mother, Peter?
Wish I could.
Listen.
At night when I'm alone
At night when I'm alone I lie awake and wonder
My mom sang that song.
My young Jack, tell me about the game of baseball. I can't remember.
My young Jack, tell me about the game of baseball. I can't remember.
Are the mates standin' or are they on horseback?
The stars are all my friends
The stars are all my friends
Till the nighttime ends
So I know I'm not alone
So I know I'm not alone
When I'm here
On my own lsn't that a wonder isn't that a wonder
When you're alone
When you're alone
You're not alone
Not really alone
Not really alone
Good night, Neverland!
What is it?
I hear it again.
Smee, is that crocodile back from the dead?
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
is that the clock?
You killed that croc years ago, Captain.
We smash every clock we find.
The little elf didn't know any better.
To the museum at once.
Shine 'em up!
Put a fresh coat of varnish on your peg right here!
Shine 'em up!
Put a fresh coat of varnish on your peg right here!
Treasure maps!
Authentic treasure maps!
Broken clocks.
Each one ticked its last tock, and now all is well.
Each one ticked its last tock, and now all is well.
- Just listen.
- l don't hear anything.
I know!
Good form.
Exactly.
Jack, you see this?
Come over here.
You can take it.
This is Barbecue's very own bedside clock.
He was quite an infamous pirate.
I smashed this clock immediately after I gutted him.
And his ship made such a pretty bonfire on the waves.
What is that... I hear?
A ticking!
Smee, stop it!
Stop the ticking!
Stop it!
Stop that tick!
There's no ticking' here.
There's nothin' left to tick.
Oh, my God.
This is for the ticking that might have been.
This is for the ticking that might have been.
- Abso-floggin'-lutely!
- Get his father's watch.
Go on.
You know you want to.
Give it a try.
Go on.
This is for... never letting me blow bubbles in my chocolate milk!
- Yes!
- Good form!
Bravo!
Here you go.
Isn't that wonderful?
This is for never letting me jump on my own bed.
Make time stand still, laddie.
For always making promises and breaking them.
For never doing anything with me.
For a father who's never there, Jack.
Jack, for a father who didn't save you on the ship.
He wouldn't save us.
Who couldn't save you, Jack.
He-
- He wouldn't.
He didn't even try.
He was there and we were there, and he wouldn't try.
Jack, he will try.
And the question will be... when the time comes, do you want to be saved?
Don't you answer now.
Now it's time to be whatever you want to be.
Put behind you any thoughts of home... that place of broken promises.
That what?
Have I ever made a promise, Jack... I have not kept?
Have I, son?
Come on.
Let's go.
I don't like this game.
Steal Hook's hook as fast as you can.
It'll make you proud.
Then you'll crow like Pan.
Confound it, Druscilla, glove me.
The game is about to start.
I need my bubbly.
Give me my bubbly.
Steal Hook's hook, then crow.
Jackie, boy!
This is for all the games your daddy missed.
Hook would never miss your games, son.
You're almost there.
Just take it.
- What's he looking at?
- You're this close.
What's the matter?
It's right there.
Grab it.
Come on, Jack.
And-a-one... and-a-two, and a toodle-loodle-loo!
Strike!
Wait for the good pitches.
Jack, Jack, he's our man!
If he can't do it, nobody can !
He's stealing second!
Stop it!
We're playing this game according to Master Jack's rules.
Bad form.
Sit down now.
Let's resume the game.
Very violent sport, isn't it, baseball?
Run home, Jack!
Run home, Jack!
"Run home, Jack."
Smee!
No!
They've got it backwards!
Tell them to turn it around!
Maggie?
Switch !
Home run, Jack!
Home run, Jack.
He can't hit the curve.
My Jack!
My Jack.
You did it!
Hoist him up!
That's my boy!
You did it, son!
Two, four, six, eight!
Who do we appreciate?
Jack!
Jack!
Gotta fly.
Happy thought.
One great big happy thought.
Less is more.
I can!
"Tootles, Wendy...
John, Michael, Peter."
Be careful, Peter.
You're a lot taller than you used to be.
Well, say something.
Do you like my dress?
You look beautiful.
- What's the occasion?
- You are.
It's a "welcome home" party.
- What happened here?
- Hook.
Burnt it when you didn't come back.
Kiss.
Wendy.
This is Wendy's house.
Noodles and Nibs built it for her.
I remember.
- Wendy used to sit in that chair.
- Yes.
But it wasn't there.
It was here.
We used to sit here while she'd darn socks... and tell us stories.
She slept here.
Tink, your apartment was right here.
Yes.
Little Michael had his basket bed right here.
John.
Taddy.
My Taddy.
Mother used to put him in the pram to keep me company.
I remember my mother.
I remember her.
You can be sure of very fine schools indeed.
First he will attend Whitehall, then Oxford...
First he will attend Whitehall, then Oxford... and of course, after graduation... he will prepare for a judgeship in the highest court... making time for marriage and family... and all of that, just like his father.
Isn't that what grown-ups want for their children?
I was afraid because I didn't want to grow up... because everybody who grows up has to die someday.
So I ran away.
Tink... you came and you saved me.
You brought me to Neverland.
You taught me to fly.
But I was still a little boy... and I missed my mother... so I decided to fly home to my very own window.
But it was shut.
They'd forgotten about me.
I found other windows to visit... ones that weren't shut closed on me.
That's how I met Wendy.
I chased my shadow in her nursery.
I expected my shadow and I would join together like drops of water.
Boy.
Why are you crying?
What's your name?
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.
What's yours?
I came back many times for Wendy, always in the spring.
And Wendy kept getting older... and older... and then I came back the last time.
Peter, I can't come with you.
I've forgotten how to fly.
I'm old, Peter.
Ever so much more than 20.
- l grew up a long time ago.
- No!
No!
- You promised.
- l have children of my own now.
They have children of their own.
That's my grandchild, Moira, asleep in the bed.
That's my grandchild, Moira, asleep in the bed.
When I saw her lying there sleeping... that moment, something changed in me forever.
I shall give her a kiss.
No, Peter.
No buttons.
No thimbles.
I couldn't bear Moira's heartbreak when she finds she can't keep you.
I mean a real kiss.
I can see why you have trouble finding a happy thought.
So many sad memories, Peter.
Bye, Taddy.
Not Taddy.
Daddy.
Daddy!
Peter, you're a daddy.
Hi, Jack.
I know why I came back.
I know why I grew up.
I wanted to be a father.
I'm a daddy.
My happy thought.
I got it.
I found it!
I lost it.
Just hold that happy thought, Peter!
Peter Pan!
Pan.
He's back!
Play!
You are the Pan.
You can fly, you can fight and you can crow.
You can fly, you can fight and you can crow.
Tink, you in there?
- Are you sad?
- l'm neither.
Please go away.
Oh, you're sick.
Maybe you need a Band-Aid or a thermometer.
Thermometer'd make it all better.
That's how Nibs made Wendy better.
- No, Peter, it's not about that.
- Oh, yes it is.
Nibs put the thermometer in her mouth.
Got all better.
Don't we have the greatest adventures?
Do you remember your next great adventure to save your kids, Peter?
Kids?
Peter Pan's got kids?
Why are you in Neverland?
Easy.
To always be a little boy and have fun.
I like this game.
Ask me another one.
Oh, dear me!
I did it.
Tink, look what happened.
You broke your house.
You're humongous.
This is the only wish I ever wished for myself.
Peter, this is the biggest feeling I've ever felt.
This is the biggest feeling I've ever had... and this is the first time I've been big enough to have it.
Peter, I want to give you a kiss.
No. I mean a real kiss.
I love you, Peter Pan.
- l love--
- Yes?
- Her.
- Her who?
More.
Moira!
I love Moira... and Jack and Maggie.
Jack and Maggie.
I have a plan.
Come on.
You gotta come.
When it's all over, you'll leave and never come back again.
What are you staring at, Peter?
Save them.
Go save them.
You silly ass.
Go.
You know, Jack, it's a very special time when a pirate gets his first earring.
You know, Jack, it's a very special time when a pirate gets his first earring.
Such a very, very beautiful feeling.
It's like the first time you run someone through with your blade.
Now, Jack, I'm going to ask you to bend your head ever so slightly.
Now, Jack, I'm going to ask you to bend your head ever so slightly.
A little more.
That's it.
And brace yourself, lad... because this is really going to hurt.
because this is really going to hurt.
Smee, what is that?
Who is that, Captain?
It's Peter Pan.
Has it been three days?
'Tis true, Peter.
Time does fly.
And so do you, I see.
How did you ever manage to fit into those smashing tights again, Peter?
How did you ever manage to fit into those smashing tights again, Peter?
Hand over my son now, and you and your men may go free.
Why don't you ask the lad yourself?
Jack, someone to see you, son.
Jack, give me your hand.
We're going home.
I am home.
Good form.
You see, Peter, he is my son.
He loves me dearly and I'm prepared to fight dearly for him.
He loves me dearly and I'm prepared to fight dearly for him.
I've waited long to shake your hand with this.
Peter Pan, prepare to meet thy doom.
Dark and sinister man, have at thee.
Don't you love it, laddie?
Once you shed blood and dole out cruelty, it's hard to stop.
It's a pirate's life, my lad!
-Don't I know him, Captain?
-No.
You've never seen him in your life.
You won't believe this, but I've found my happy thought.
It took me three days to find it, but guess what happened when I did?
Up I went.
You know what my happy thought was?
It was you.
That's my dad, but he hates to fly.
Bangerang!
Bangerang!
Call out the village militia!
We'll need every last man!
If there's anybody not fighting, get here quick!
If there's anybody not fighting, get here quick!
Form ranks!

Get ready to show 'em the white light we're made of, boys!
Remember the fires from hell that forged you !
Charge!

We'll show you who's chicken!
Watch this!
Smee, do something intelligent.
Smee!

Smee's me.
What about me?
Thudball !
Fire!
Gangway!
Look out below!
Help!
Somebody, help!
Take it!
Lost Boys, down!

It's time for Smee.
Where do you think you're going?
Get away from that window!
Hook!
Rufio.
The old man is mine.
Jack!
Save me!
My Maggie.
Jack!
- Wait.
Ain't you--
- Peter Pan.
- Come on.
- Daddy!
Peter Pan's my... dad?
- Maggie!
- Get it off me!
I'll never lose you again.
Lost Boys, we got 'em on the run !
Bangerang!
Here comes Pan!
Looky, looky, I got Hooky.
Hook!
No!
- Do you know what I wish?
- What?
I wish I had a dad...
like you.
I wish I had a dad...
like you.
Oh, Dad, I'm sorry.
Are you ready for me, Peter?
Come on.
Humor the Hook.
Dad?
I wanna go home.
What are you talking about?
You are home.
Where are you going?
Lost Boys!
Victory banquet!
Peter!
Where are you going?
Come back here and fight me!
I'll find you wherever you are.
Do you hear me?
Bad form, Peter!
Come back!
You need a mother very, very badly!
Smee, follow me.
Stairs.
Just movin' your personals somewhere safer.
I swear to you, wherever you go, wherever you are... I vow there will always be daggers bearing notes signed "James Hook."
I vow there will always be daggers bearing notes signed "James Hook."
They will be flung at the doors of your children's children's children.
They will be flung at the doors of your children's children's children.
Do you hear me?
What do you want, old man?
- Just you.
- You got me, James Hook.
Pan the Avenger is back.
And the Hook is waiting, Peter Pan.
Put up your swords.
It's Hook or me this time.
- Prepare to die, Peter.
- To die would be a great adventure.
Death is the only adventure you have left.
- l remember you being a lot bigger.
- To a ten-year-old, I'm huge.
No pain, no gain, James.
Pan!
Good form, old man.
You know you're not really Peter Pan, don't you?
This is only a dream.
When you wake up, you'll just be Peter Banning... a cold, selfish man who drinks too much, is obsessed with success... and runs and hides from his wife and children.
- l believe in you.
- l believe in you.
I believe in you, Peter.
I believe in you.
You are the Pan.
You're Peter Pan.
I believe in you...
Peter Pan.
- Bad form!
- Stop!
Now we end this.
You blackguard!
Hello.
Tick-tock, tick-tock, Hook's afraid of an ordinary clock.
I think not. I think James Hook's afraid of time ticking away!
Good form, Peter.
I am fallen.
Give me my dignity.
You took my hand.
You owe me something.
You killed Rufio, you kidnapped my children.
You deserve to die.
You killed Rufio, you kidnapped my children.
You deserve to die.
Strike, Peter Pan.
Strike true.
Daddy... let's go home, please?
He's just a mean old man without a mommy.
Yeah, Dad.
Let's go.
He can't hurt us anymore.
Bless you, child.
Good form, Jack.
After all, what would the world be like without...
Captain Hook?
I want you to take your ship and go.
And I never want to see your face in Neverland again.
- Look out!
- Fools!
James Hook is Neverland!
Whenever children read, it will say...
"Thus perished Peter Pan."
What's happening?
What is happening?
I want my mommy!
Hook's gone.
Bangerang!
No more Hook!
No more Hook!
Hooray for Pan the Man !
What's wrong, Peter?
I can't stay and play.
I've done what I came to do and now I have to go back.
No, Peter, please.
Tink, make my kids glow.
Jack, Maggie... all you have to do is think one happy thought, and you'll fly like me.
all you have to do is think one happy thought, and you'll fly like me.
Mommy!
My dad...
Peter Pan.
Tink, you know the way.
I'll be just behind you.
Don't leave us, Peter, and don't say good-bye.
What's good-bye?
It's going away.
That's what it is.
Forgetting about us all over again.
You're all my Lost Boys.
I'll never forget you.
Never.
So who do I leave in charge?
I want you to take care of everyone who's smaller than you.
Okay.
Then who do I look after?
Neverbugs.
Little ones.
That was a great game.
Thank you for believing.
I know her.
She looks like an angel.
Let's not wake her yet.
Oh, my dear child.
Have you been up all night?
Oh, my dear child.
Have you been up all night?
I see them in their beds so often in my dreams... when I wake up, they're still there.
Mommy!
Tink.
Hello.
Havin' trouble with the missus?
You will have by the time you get home.
Say it, Peter.
Say it and mean it.
I believe in fairies.
You know that place between asleep and awake?
That place where you still remember dreaming?
That's where l'll always love you...
Peter Pan.
That's where l'll be waiting.
Nana!
Oh, give us a kiss.
Come here, you drool machine.
Maggie, Moira, Jack!
Brad, hi!
You've been holding this long?
I'm incredible.
Yeah.
Neverland.
Lost Boys.
Jim Hook, duel to the death.
I'll fill you in later.
I'd love to chat, but I gotta climb a drainpipe right now.
I'd love to chat, but I gotta climb a drainpipe right now.
Why?
'Cause I ran out of fairy dust.
If not, I would've flown up.
"Why?"
- Mom, I fought pirates!
- You would've loved it there!
Maggie, Moira, Jack!
Granny Wendy!
Let me in.
Please.
Excuse me.
Do you have an appointment?
What did I tell you about this window?
Always keep it open !
Never, ever, ever close it!
I have to take this.
Brad, have you ever wondered what it's like to feel the exhilaration of flying?
Brad, have you ever wondered what it's like to feel the exhilaration of flying?
Feel this.
Where have you been?
- Fly me, Daddy!
- Anytime, Maggie!
To infinity and back again.
Hello, Peter.
I missed the adventure again, didn't I?
I think these belong to you.
Look!
See!
Look!
I didn't lose my marbles after all!
Wendy, look!
I didn't lose my marbles after all!
Hello, boy.
Hello, Wendy lady.
Give us a squdge.
Boy, why are you crying?
I don't know.
A tear for every happy thought.
- One for me?
- One for me?
And one for me!
Seize the day!
So, your adventures are over.
Oh, no.
To live--
To live would be an awfully big adventure.
Boy, why are you crying?
I was crying because I couldn't get my shadow to stick.
Besides, I wasn't crying.
"l shall sew it on for you, my little man. lt may hurt a little."
I shall sew it on for you, my little man.
It may hurt a little.
What is your name?
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.
- What's yours?
- Peter Pan.
Watch your daughter.
She's wonderful.
- Yeah.
- She's stealing the show.
I think it's perfectly sweet of you.
- Louder!
- l think it's perfectly sweet of you.
- Louder!
- l think it's perfectly sweet of you.
I shall give you a kiss if you like.
Don't you know what a kiss is?
I shall once you give one to me.
Now I shall give you a kiss.
I don't ever want to become a man.
Yuck!
I always want to be a little boy and to have fun.
We wanna be like Peter Pan
We don't wanna grow up
Brad.
I'm at my daughter's play.
Then when it's time to be a man
We're not gonna show up lt's impossible.
I'm on a plane to London tomorrow night with my family.
A children's hospital--
A children's hospital is dedicating an entire wing to Granny Wendy.
- Peter, you're missing it.
- All right.
Want a meeting tomorrow, a.m.?
Dad, my game.
You promised.
Listen, it's my son's big game.
Last game of the season, Santa Series.
I gotta be there. I promised.
So, we'll make it a short meeting.
I'll be there.
My word is my bond.
We never, never, never, never
Never, ever wanna grow up Yuck
Strike three, you're out!
Jack!
Come on, Blue Jays!
Where is your father?
He's missing it.
Daddy'll be here.
He promised.
- Jerry, Jack--
- Jim.
I said that.
Take the video camera, go to the game, film what I miss.
-Can I say something?
-Mr.
Banning, here's the tribute speech.
- On cards?
- Yes, sir.
- Number those.
Who wrote it?
- Ned Miller.
I loved his annual report.
Read it back to me.
"Lord Whitehall, honored guests, for the past 70 years...
- the Granny Wendy we honor tonight...
- That's nice.
has given hope and care and life to hundreds of homeless children."
Great.
Very personal.
Mommy, where is Daddy?
- My briefcase--
- Banning.
Well, gotta fly.
Don't worry.
More people crash in cars than on planes.
It's safer to fly than crossing the street.
Don't look down.
Well, if it's your time to go, it's your time to go.
And remember, don't let your arms get tired!
What if it's the pilot's time to go?
Come on, keep us alive, Banning!
- Okay, come on!
- Hi, Mrs. Banning!
I'm from the office.
- Which one's your son?
- He's up to bat.
Thank you.
Don't look at me.
Focus!
Stay focused.
Come on, Jack.
One time.
Please not a curve ball.
Mama wants a new pair of shoes.
Drive me home, Jack!
That's a game.
Two, four, six, eight Who do we appreciate
Blue Jays
Yeah, Brad.
That's real good.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen.
Please do not allow this minor turbulence to disturb you.
For now, please sit back and relax, and enjoy the remainder of the flight.
Thank you.
- Look what Jack drew.
- That's very nice, dear.
- What's that?
- Fire.
Fire?
Really?
- ls that our plane?
- Yep.
- Who are all these people?
- That's Jack, that's me... that's Mom, and that's you.
Where's my parachute?
I'm not gonna make it to my next birthday.
You're not gonna die without a phone and fax machine.
I'm halfway there.
I got the phone in the briefcase.
Talk to him.
Why didn't I have a parachute, Jackie?
Take a wild guess.
- Jackie--
- Jack.
Will you stop that?
You can break a window.
They're double-layered.
You can't break them.
Give me that.
You're afraid you're gonna get sucked out.
I'm not afraid of being sucked out.
Yes, you are.
You're afraid you're going to be sucked out.
Just stop.
Jack, next season I'm coming to six games. I promise.
Yeah, be sure to buy enough videotape.
Hey, Jack.
My word is my bond.
Yeah, junk bonds.
What the hell's the matter with you?
When will you stop acting like a child?
I am a child.
Grow up.
It's been a long time.
Let's have fun, Peter.
London's a magical place for children.
Well, it was for us.
It's gotten very expensive.
Jack, don't.
You could put someone's eye out.
Maggie.
- Peter, it's number 14.
- Oh, 14.
Okay.
Now, what do you say to Granny Wendy? "How do you do?"
Jack, get down from there.
You'll break your neck.
Be careful.
is Granny Wendy the real Wendy from my play?
- Not really.
- Sort of.
Don't be a sloucher.
Take that gum out of your mouth.
It's time to look our best.
Remember, dears:
First impressions are the most important.
Shoes tied, shirt tucked.
Give me this.
All right.
Remember, you're in England, land of good manners.
- Uncle Tootles.
- lt's snowing!
Look at these adorable children!
It's good to see you, Libby, Linda-
- Lisa!
- Liza.
- l said that.
Moira, how are you?
Look at the size of the-- Look at you, such a big, sweet thing.
- Granny Wendy will be right down.
- She's upstairs?
Oh, good.
No baseball.
- Did you do this for us?
- Yes, I did.
- Thank you.
- l've been cooking all week.
What have you been cooking?
Mince pies?
Brandy snaps?
Oh, Peter, look at this.
- Who's that?
- lt's you.
- Was I ever that young?
- Yes.
- What's gotten into you?
- Oh, this house has gotten to me.
Some of those things I was when I was young have never left me.
Oh, thank God, Peter.
We were children in these rooms.
Lost, lost, lost.
Lost what?
I've lost my marbles.
- Okay.
Lisa?
- Liza.
Liza. I thought he was supposed to be in a home.
It broke Wendy's heart.
After all, Tootles is Wendy's first orphan.
- Which is which?
- The large bag is mine... that one's Moira's, and the two smaller ones are the children's.
Hello, boy.
Hello, Wendy.
I told you, Gran, I'd get him here, by hook or by crook.
Sorry it's been so long between visits.
It's been ten years between visits, but never mind.
Come and give me a squdge.
And this lovely lady can't-- it can't be Maggie.
Yes, it can.
And know what, Great-Grandma?
- l just played you at school.
- And don't you just look the part.
Oh, can this giant be Jack?
How much you've grown in a year.
Oh, can this giant be Jack?
How much you've grown in a year.
I'm supposed to tell you about congratulations for opening the... I'm supposed to tell you about congratulations for opening the... orphan hospital, and how great the dedication is.
orphan hospital, and how great the dedication is.
And-
- Yeah.
- Thank you so very much.
- You're welcome.
Now, there is one rule I insist be obeyed while you are in my house.
Now, there is one rule I insist be obeyed while you are in my house.
No growing up.
Stop this very instant... and that includes you, Mr. Chairman of the Board Banning.
Sorry.
Too late, Gran.
And what is so terribly important about your terribly important business?
And what is so terribly important about your terribly important business?
Well, you see, when a big company's in trouble, Dad sails in.
- And if there's any resistance, Dad--
- He's exaggerating.
I'm still into mergers and acquisitions and I'm dabbling into land development.
I'm still into mergers and acquisitions and I'm dabbling into land development.
Any resistance, and he blows them out of the water.
So, Peter, you've become a pirate.
So, Peter, you've become a pirate.
- Peter!
- What?
Brad's on the line.
He says it's urgent.
- Peter, do you like my dress?
- Great, Gran.
Real nice.
Thanks.
Brad.
Good news?
What?
What Sierra Club report?
I thought we had these guys.
He's trying to suck my blood, and he drools all over my neck.
- What did they find?
- Peter, that's a portable phone.
- A Cozy Blue Owl?
- There's nine other room in the house.
Well, listen.
Tell them there've always been casualties of evolution.
Ask them if anybody misses the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
I do.
Boy, do I ever.
Wow.
Are you kidding?
Wait a minute.
A ten-inch owl has a 50-mile mating radius?
Wait a minute.
A ten-inch owl has a 50-mile mating radius?
Why don't they just fornicate someplace else?
A $5 billion deal falling apart because of this?
A $5 billion deal falling apart because of this?
Why doesn't somebody just shoot me in the head?
Bang!
Bang!
- Will everybody just shut up!
- l'm sorry.
Leave me alone for one moment.
Moira, get them outta here.
I'm on the phone call of my life.
Come on, Jack.
Out.
Come with me.
I'll show you the window where your father and I used to blow out the stars.
I never should have come. I should have stayed till the deal was done.
You haven't been here for ten years, though Granny asked you every year.
- l've been busy.
- You promised the kids some real time.
- l just got here.
- You've done nothing but yell at them.
- That's not true.
- How many more broken promises, Peter?
I'm sorry.
It's Brad.
I gotta take this call.
I gotta fix this.
No.
You've got to fix your family first.
Peter, hello.
Are you there?
What- l'm sorry about your deal.
- You hated the deal.
I hated the deal, but I'm sorry you feel so badly about it.
Your children love you.
They want to play with you.
How long do you think that lasts?
Soon Jack may not even want you to come to his games.
We have a few special years with our children... when they're the ones that want us around.
After that, you're going to be running after them for a bit of attention.
It's so fast, Peter.
It's a few years, and then it's over.
And you are not being careful.
And you are missing it.
Peter, where are you?
All children, except one, grow up.
All children, except one, grow up.
You know where fairies come from, don't you, Maggie?
"When the first baby laughed for the first time... the laugh broke into a thousand pieces... and they all went skipping about.
That was the beginning of fairies."
And look.
I'm Wendy.
Or was, a long time ago.
But Jack says you're not the really real Wendy.
But Jack says you're not the really real Wendy.
Ah, well, you see where Jack is?
Well, that is the same window, and this is the same room... where we made up stories about Peter and Neverland and scary old Captain Hook.
where we made up stories about Peter and Neverland and scary old Captain Hook.
And do you know, Mr. Barrie-- well, Sir James-- our neighbor...
And do you know, Mr. Barrie-- well, Sir James-- our neighbor... he loved our stories so much that he wrote them all down in a book... oh, dear me, 80 years ago.
You're really old.
That's very true.
I'm sorry I have to break this up, but I have to steal Granny Wendy... or she'll be late for the most important event of her life.
Oh, dear.
Daddy, I made something for you.
You're gonna love this.
It's a hug.
Next time you fly you won't have to be scared.
She's made you a parachute.
That's very clever, dear.
Jack, get away from there.
What have I told you about open windows?
Keep this window closed.
I've told you this a hundred times.
- Do we have open windows at home?
- No, they've all got bars on them.
Come on, into bed.
Who took my baseball?
That mean, scary man at the window stole it.
- There's no scary man.
- But he says he's a window washer.
- There's no scary man.
- But he says he's a window washer.
- What is this?
- This is a baseball glove.
You can catch things with it, take hot things out of the oven... or hit your sister with it.
Tootles made it for me.
- lt smells nice.
- lt's paper, honey.
Night.
Hey, Jack.
Faker.
Jack, you're in charge now.
This is my very special watch so you can keep track of the time.
Don't go out, Mom, please.
Good night.
Dear night lights, protect my sleeping babes.
Burn clear and steadfast tonight.
I read recently that they're now using lawyers instead of rats... for scientific experiments.
They do this for two reasons.
One, the scientists become less attached to the lawyers.
And two, there are certain things that even rats won't do.
I want to thank the board of trustees of the Great Ormond Street Hospital... for having me here this evening, and beg your forgiveness... because normally I'm used to addressing shareholders.
We don't know each other, and I doubt that we have very much in common...
We don't know each other, and I doubt that we have very much in common... except this wonderful woman, Wendy Angela Darling.
Granny Wendy brought me in from the cold.
She taught me to read and write.
She even found people to be my parents and adopt me.
She's loved so many children... just so efforlet-- effors-- effortlessly.
just so efforlet-- effors-- effortlessly.
That's her achievement.
Many of you here tonight were once lost children... but Granny Wendy found parents and homes for each of you... and saved you-- that's her miracle.
And I know that if you could stand now you would express... much better than I have your feelings of... gratitude... appreciation... and warm feelings... for this wonderful woman.
I guess we do have something in common.
We're orphans.
Hook!
Are you all right?
Thank you, Nigel-
- Norman?
- Neville, sir.
- Neville. ls that English?
Merry Christmas.
- l was proud of you.
- Really?
It was a beautiful speech.
Hello?
My God.
The children.
Maggie?
Jack, answer me!
The wind came up, the door closed on me... and the children were screaming.
The window.
"Dear Peter, your presence is required at the request of your children."
"Kindest personal regards, JAS Hook...
"Kindest personal regards, JAS Hook...
Captain."
Have to fly.
Have to fight.
Have to crow.
Have to save Maggie.
Have to save Jack.
Hook is back.
Who?
Gran?
Well, the lab boys can analyze this little lot.
Mr. and Mrs. Banning, we've wired the phones, and two men will stay outside.
Mr. and Mrs. Banning, we've wired the phones, and two men will stay outside.
Of course, it is possible this whole thing is some kind of ridiculous prank.
My children are missing.
Yes, but the literary history of the family and everything suggests--
- Well, let's hope so.
- l've forgotten how to fly.
Yes, well, one does.
Good night, then, ma'am, sir.
No more happy thoughts.
Lost.
Nothing we can do.
The police will do everything--
The police can do nothing.
Oh, really?
Maybe we should call the American police.
In a crisis, we English always make a cup of tea.
Moira, would you?
- Tea?
- Of course, Gran.
Don't forget to warm the pot.
- l'll go.
Moira--
- Peter.
You stay.
Don't worry, Granny Wendy.
I wasn't going to leave.
Hand me my book, please.
It's time to tell you at last.
Tell me what?
How far back can you remember, Peter?
I remember the hospital on Great Ormond Street.
You worked with orphans, you taught me to read.
You arranged for the adoption by my American parents, Hank and Jane Banning.
You were 12-- nearly 13.
I mean before that.
There's nothing before that.
Try, Peter.
Do try.
Nothing.
You know, when I was young... no other girl held your favor the way I did.
I half expected you to alight on the church and forbid my vows... on my wedding day.
I wore a pink satin sash.
But you didn't come.
Grandma--
Yes, I was an old lady when I wrapped you in blankets... a grandmother... with my 13-year-old granddaughter asleep in the bed-
- Moira.
with my 13-year-old granddaughter asleep in the bed-
- Moira.
And when you saw her... that was when you decided not to go back to Neverland.
Where?
To Never-Neverland.
Moira!
I'm getting Moira.
- l've tried to tell you so many times--
- Maybe the tea's ready.
- l knew you'd forgotten.
- l'm not ready to deal with this now.
The stories are true, I swear to you.
I swear on everything I adore.
And now he's come back to seek his revenge.
The fight isn't over for Captain James Hook.
He wants you back.
He knows you'll follow Maggie and Jack... to the ends of the earth and beyond, and by heaven you must find a way.
to the ends of the earth and beyond, and by heaven you must find a way.
Only you can save your children.
Somehow you must go back.
You must make yourself remember.
Remember what?
Peter, don't you know who you are?
Yes, boy.
Sorry.
Parachute.
Firefly from hell!
Big damn bug!
Oh, it is you, it is!
A big you.
I guess it's not bad that you're big.
You were always bigger than me.
But now maybe this means you'll be twice as much fun.
What fun we'll have again!
What times!
What great games!
You're a little f--
Fairy.
Pixie.
And if less is more, there's no end to me, Peter Pan.
- Peter Banning.
- Pan.
Whoever you are, it's still you.
'Cause only one person has that smell.
Smell?
The smell of someone who's ridden the back of the wind, Peter.
The smell of a hundred fun summers of sleeping in trees... adventures with Indians and pirates.
Oh, remember, Peter?
The world was ours.
We could do everything or nothing.
All I had to be was anything, 'cause it was always us.
Oh, no. lt's finally happened.
I'm having a total nervous breakdown.
Oh, no. lt's finally happened.
I'm having a total nervous breakdown.
Peter, follow me and all will be well.
Or I'm dying.
I'm heading towards the white light.
I've left my body.
See, there's my house way down there.
There are my feet.
Oh, my God.
Where are we going?
- To save your children, of course.
- How do you know about my kids?
Everybody knows.
Captain Hook's got them and you've got to fight him.
Let's fly!
It is true, then.
You did grow up.
I drank poison for you.
You used to call me Tink.
- Have you forgotten everything?
- Are you in there, little bug?
I'm not a bug.
I'm a fairy.
I do not believe in fairies.
Every time someone says, "l do not believe in fairies"... somewhere there's a fairy that falls down dead.
I do not believe in fairies!
Oh, my God, I think I killed it.
Are you alive, little bug?
Look out!
Clap your hands, Peter.
It's the only way to save me.
Louder.
Louder, Peter!
Okay, I'm clapping!
Oh, God, you're alive.
All right, now.
Who am I?
You're, um--
You're a Freudian hallucination having something to do with my mother... and I don't know why you have wings, but you have very lovely legs... and you're a very nice tiny person, and what am I saying?
I don't know who my mother was, I'm an orphan, and I've never taken drugs... because I missed the '60s, I was an accountant.
Guess again.
Oh, look.
Stars.
That's right, Peter.
Second star to the right and straight on till morning.
Neverland.
What a nightmare.
Moira!
Hear ye, hear ye!
Roll out.
Roll out!
Neverbirds!
Three for a farthing.
Pies for sale.
Lovely fish !
Fresh fish!
We keep the eyes in so they'll see you through the week.
Excuse me.
is there a pay phone around here?
- That is so real.
- Peter, get back here!
Get down, get low.
Hide!
Hello.
If it ain't the Mother Inferior.
Gentlemen, I'm looking for someone.
I fancy them shiny shoes for my booty.
You can get them at Armani.
Tink, help me!
Tinkerball-
- Tinkerbun--
Don't get no blood on them boots!
They's mine!
Help me, Tinkerbell!
You pixie devil!
Oh, please don't.
I have a bad back.
Ya pixie devil !
Are you related to Mighty Mouse?
If you insist on seeing Hook and desire to be alive when you do so... do exactly what I say.
Your left arm is dead, it hangs lifeless at your side.
Lean on the crutch!
Left foot turned in.
Tilt your head and glare with your good eye.
Now crack your mouth and drool.
Now growl.
Growl !
- How are you?
- Not bad, and you?
- Not bad!
- All right!
Put your faces on, girls.
Here comes Smee!
Follow that hook!
Make way for the hook!
He's gonna love this hook!
Hook, show us the hook
Hook, give us the hook
Good morning, Neverland!
Good morning, Mr. Smee!
- Tie down the main mast, mateys...
- Aye!
'cause here he is-- the cunning king fish... the bad barracuda... a man so deep, he's almost unfathomable.
a man so deep, he's almost unfathomable.
A man so quick, he's even fast asleep.
Thank you.
Now, let's give him a very big hand, 'cause he's only got one.
I give you the steel-handed stingray...
Captain James Hook!
See how greatly the men favor you, sir?
The pewling spawn-- how I despise them.
Go get 'em, Captain !
Thank you, thank you.
Well, my stupid, sorry, parasitic sacks of entrails...
Well, my stupid, sorry, parasitic sacks of entrails... revenge is mine.
Long live the hook!
I baited that hook, and now I'm very proud to announce... we have his children.
Oh, my God.
Jack and Maggie.
Long live Hook
Finally I'm going to kill Peter Pan... that cocky boy who cut off my hand and fed it to the crocodile!
And who killed that cunning crocodile?
Who stuffed him?
Who made him into a quiet clock?
Who went into the other world and stole Pan's children?
And who didn't believe I could do it?
Who doubted me?
Who amongst us does not belong?
Someone here does not belong, a stranger amongst the loyal.
I will weed you out.
You!
Where's the carpet, Smee?
Oh, sorry, sir.
You.
That's right, you.
No, not you.
Not you.
You.
You bet against me bringing Pan back here, didn't you?
No.
Tell your captain the truth.
Oh, say it.
- l did.
- Yes, you made a boo-boo.
The Boo Box.
Not that!
Not the Boo Box!
Good.
You cannot lie to the captain!
Boo!
- Long live Hook
- Put me down !
I want my mommy!
I want my daddy!
Hello, children.
Comfy?
Cozy?
Those are my kids!
Are you okay?
Everything's going to be all right.
Get out of the way!
Daddy's here.
Hook, I want those kids, or you better get an attorney that's better than me.
- Who are you?
- Peter Banning, attorney at law.
- Those are my children.
- Those are your--
- Children.
- These are your children?
- Yes, they are.
- And you're--
- Peter.
- You're Peter?
- ls there an echo in here?
- My great and worthy opponent?
- Yes.
- No!
Smee!
Who is this impostor?
Peter-floggin'-flyin'
-Pan !
No, I'm not Peter Pan.
I am just an ordinary-- l've got a sworn affidavit by a T-Bell.
I've got his medical history, I've even got his dental records.
- Excuse me.
- You tryin' to do me out of a job?
- What's the matter with you?
- May I show you something?
- Will you let go of me?
- Release him.
- May I show you this?
- Will you shut him up?
Oh, flog off.
Just shut up.
- Captain, put these on.
- l want to see the scar.
The hypertrophy.
Here's the scar where you sliced him during the Tiger Lily incident.
- That's my appendix.
- What's this?
Fairy footprints.
He's Peter Pan or I've got a dead man's dinghy.
Fairy footprints.
He's Peter Pan or I've got a dead man's dinghy.
is it you?
My great and worthy opponent?
But it can't be.
Not this pitiful, spineless, pasty, bloated codfish I see before me.
Not this pitiful, spineless, pasty, bloated codfish I see before me.
You're not even a shadow of Peter Pan.
I think we have an obligation to clarify this Pan problem...
- This disaster.
- which must be remedied.
- Expediently, I agree.
- l want my children.
- For me the stakes can be no higher.
- For me they can have sunk no lower.
I want my war!
Blow him out of the water, Dad!
Daddy's handling this.
It's okay.
Oh, come on, Peter.
Pick up your weapon.
All right.
How much?
Hoist and raise the kiddies!
Dad, help!
I'll make you a deal, Mr. Chairman of the Board.
Fly up there and touch the outstretched fingers... of your frightened children, and I'll set them free.
I can't fly.
Explode out of there!
Stop the charade!
Free your children!
- Dad, help!
- Daddy!
- l beg your pardon?
- l have a real problem with heights.
You must be joking.
Peter Pan has a real problem with heights.
- l'm not Peter Pan.
- Dad, help!
It's okay.
Hang on, son.
I'm coming, sweetheart.
Someone give me a hand.
I already have.
Help us, Daddy!
- Come on !
- Save us, Daddy!
Save me, Daddy!
You know who you are.
What new game is this, Peter?
Fly!
Stop pretending!
Fly!
I know it's you!
Be the Pan you are.
Fly.
Fly.
Think a happy thought.
All you have to do is touch our fingers and we'll be able to go home.
All you have to do is touch our fingers and we'll be able to go home.
Touch them, Peter, and it's all been just a bad dream.
Just reach out and touch them.
Flap your arms and fly!
Reach !
Come on, Daddy.
Mommy could do it.
Smee, I don't understand.
Why doesn't he fly?
is he not Peter Pan?
Smee, I don't understand.
Why doesn't he fly?
is he not Peter Pan?
He's Peter Pan, all right, Captain.
He's just been away from Neverland for so long, his mind's been "junk-tified."
He's just been away from Neverland for so long, his mind's been "junk-tified."
He's forgotten everything.
Please don't give up.
Dad.
I wanna go home.
Gentlemen, I'm afraid I have decided... to cancel the war.
He can't fly, but he can swim!
Kill them.
Kill them all.
- Dad!
- Bring on the plank!
And I never want to hear the name "Peter Pan" again!
What about the name "Hook"?
is that how you want to be remembered?
As a bully?
Or as the great warrior who defeated a heroic Pan?
One week and I'll get him in shape, and you can have your dirty old war.
It's a trick, Captain.
Let me blast that buzzing vixen to pixie hell.
It's a trick, Captain.
Let me blast that buzzing vixen to pixie hell.
Smee.
You promised people the war of the century.
Your whole life has been building to this moment.
Mortal combat, glory, Hook versus Pan!
That is not Pan.
Two days.
Four-- bare minimum for a decent Pan.
Three.
Final offer.
Done.
And you better deliver, Miss Bell... or no amount of clapping will bring you back from where l will send you.
Hear me, men.
For reasons of good form... I've decided that the so-called Pan will return in three days... to commence the arbitrament of the sword.
Smee, translate.
In three days we're gonna have a war... a battle between good and evil, to the death.
Help me.
Snow!
Hot.
What?
Help!
Get me down !
Oh, you're alive!
Oh, get me down!
I believe!
Lost Boys, Lost Boys, wake up!
Pan's back!
Lost Boys, wake up!
That was my pillow!
Sure, yeah, I'm up.
Wake up, you sleepyheads!
Pan's back!
Who's the shrub?
Bangerang!
That ain't Peter Pan.
- He's old.
- He's fat.
Not so fat to me.
He's an old, fat grandpa man.
Rufio!
Oh, that is so dangerous.
That's enough!
Okay, mister.
All right.
The show's over now.
You put that thing away, put it down before you poke somebody's eye out.
You put that thing away, put it down before you poke somebody's eye out.
You're not old enough to shave.
What are you doing with a sword?
Flying around-- This is an insurance nightmare!
What is this, some Lord of the Flies preschool?
Where are your parents?
Who's in charge here?
No, Mr. Skunkhead with too much mousse.
You are just a punk kid.
I want to speak to a grown-up.
- All grown-ups are pirates.
- Excuse me?
We kill pirates.
I'm not a pirate.
It so happens I am a lawyer.
Kill the lawyer!
I'm not that kind of lawyer.
I've been shot!
Help!
Help me, somebody!
Boys, listen!
He married Wendy's granddaughter!
Hook has kidnapped his kids.
He's just out of shape.
We have to make him bangerang.
Why are you doing this to me?
Rufio, you're the best with a sword.
Please teach him.
We gotta make him remember.
Excuse me.
- Help me!
- Help me!
- Not you.
- Not you?
Helmets!
Oh, my.
A wall.
Stop it!
Lost Boys, stop it!
Play!
You're dead, jolly man.
He can't do those things.
He can't even play simple games.
Hook has got his kids, and I've got three days... to get him ready to fight, and I need everybody's help.
Peter Pan's gots kids?
You can't fly, fight, or crow.
So... if any of you says this here scug ain't Peter Pan, cross the line.
if any of you says this here scug ain't Peter Pan, cross the line.
Hi.
What?
Be right back.
- What?
- You are embarrassing me!
Oh, there you are, Peter.
But, Peter, you've grown up.
You promised never to grow old.
But, Peter, you've grown up.
You promised never to grow old.
His nose got real big.
Well, welcome back to Neverland, Pan the Man.
Don't listen to that stinkin' fairy and that brainless fungus!
I got Pan's sword.
I'm the Pan now.
You think this guy's gonna take it from me, Rufio?
Wait!
If Tink believes, maybe he is.
Are you gonna follow this drooler... against Capitán Hook?
What's he doin' here if he's not Peter Pan, huh?
He don't look happy here.
And who are them kids Hook's got?
- Give him a chance!
- Those are my kids.
And Hook is gonna kill them unless we do something.
Help me.
Please?
Come on!
Give him a chance!
I should claw myself with my own hook, Smee.
Not to kill Pan when I had the chance.
What have I done?
What have I done, Smee?
Agreed to a preposterous plan?
An absurd war?
Now I'm bound by my indefatigable good form to wait.
- l'll fix you a nice plate.
- Wait for what?
Whether it be three days or decades, he will always be a fat old Pan.
Whether it be three days or decades, he will always be a fat old Pan.
Oh, I hate being disappointed, Smee... and I hate living in this flawed body... and I hate living in Neverland... and I hate, I hate... I hate Peter Pan!
I hate Peter Pan!
Smee, I've just had a sublime vision.
All the jagged parts of my life have come together... to form a complete and mystical whole.
An epiphany.
A piffy what?
- My life is over.
- You mean you've lost your appetite?
Yes.
Good-bye.
Where are you going?
Are you getting dramatic?
Good-bye, Smee.
Captain, why don't we play with your island, eh?
You know, all the little injuns and soldiers and all the Lost Boys?
You know, all the little injuns and soldiers and all the Lost Boys?
No stopping me this time, Smee.
This is it.
No stopping me this time, Smee.
This is it.
Don't make a move, Smee.
Not a step.
My finger's on the trigger.
- Don't try to stop me.
- On, not again.
This is it.
Don't try to stop me this time, Smee.
Don't try to stop me this time, Smee.
Don't you dare try to stop me this time.
Try to stop me.
Don't you dare try to stop me this time.
Try to stop me.
You'd better get up off your ass.
Get over here, Smee!
- l'm comin'!
- Stop me!
This is not a joke!
I'm committing suicide!
-Don't ever frighten me like that again.
-l'm sorry.
- Are you some kind of sadist?
- l'm sorry.
How do you feel now?
- l want to die.
- Oh, now, now.
- There's no adventure here.
- You call this no adventure?
Death is the only great adventure I have left.
- Let's get you into bed.
- lt's all over.
- Don't upset yourself.
- l want to go beddy-bye.
- You're still you, I'm still me.
- My career is over.
- There's wars you haven't thought of.
- This war was supposed to end all wars.
- And it will.
- The ultimate war.
Rock-a-bye Captain in the crow's nest
There must be a way to get at him, Smee, to get even with him... to get him where it really would hurt.
There must be something I haven't thought of.
Where is he vulnerable?
Don't let's have any more of this talk about doin' away with yourself.
I mean, what would the world be like without Captain Hook?
Indeed.
Good form, Smee.
What would the world be like without Captain Hook?
- There you go.
- l'm ready for my nightcap.
Abso-floggin'-lutely.
I think a bit of skulduggery would do you good.
Take your mind off this Pan business.
First thing tomorrow morning, we'll shoot some Indians out of Long Tom.
I'm tired of killing Indians and Lost Boys. I've killed them most of my life.
I want to kill Peter Pan.
I want to kill him!
Give me the power to kill him.
Oh, dear.
I've just had an apostrophe.
I think you mean an epiphany.
Lightning has just struck my brain.
Well, that must hurt.
- Pan's kids.
- What about them?
- You could make 'em like you.
- Say what?
- We could make the buggers love you.
- No, Smee.
No little children love me.
- Captain, that is the point.
- What do you mean?
That is the ultimate revenge.
- What is?
- Pan's kids in love with Hook.
- What are you getting on about?
- lt's the ultimate payback.
- What is?
- lmagine Pan's puss...
- Yes?
- when he faces you... and his kids standing' beside you... ready to fight for the sleaziest sleaze of the Seven Seas, Captain James Hook.
ready to fight for the sleaziest sleaze of the Seven Seas, Captain James Hook.
- Captain, it's beautiful.
- Yes, I see.
Don't worry about that, Captain.
Thank you.
You know, Smee, I like it!
Oh, Smee, what a superb idea I've just had!
Tomorrow I'll make Pan's brats love me.
Oh, Peter Pan will fly again.
He'll remember how.
And if he doesn't, those dirty Lost Boys will jog his memory.
Yes, you'll see.
He'll crow, he'll fight, he'll fly... and then, he'll die.
Pick 'em up Move 'em down

Fight, Gramps.
Give it your best shot.
Rufio's only trying to help.
Listen, learn.
Okay.
Ready?
I don't want to hurt you.
- Watch it.
He don't have armor on.
- Be bangerang, old man.
What are you doing?
How does this help me get my kids back?
What do I have to do next?
Next: time to fly.
Just think happy thoughts.
Peter, think happy thoughts.
All you need is one happy thought.
One happy thought will make you fly.
I got it!
Not being in this slingshot would make me very happy!
Not being in this slingshot would make me very happy!
He's goin' up!
He's comin' down !
Now pay attention, class.
We have a lot to go over.
Lesson one:
Why parents hate their children.
Lesson one:
Why parents hate their children.
Anyone?
Doesn't Mommy read to us every night?
You, the cute little urchin in the front row.
You, the cute little urchin in the front row.
Won't you share your thoughts with the whole class?
Won't you share your thoughts with the whole class?
I said Mommy reads to us every night... because she loves us very much.
Loves you?
Isn't that the--
The "L" word, Captain.
Oh, yes.
No, child.
I think your mother reads to you every night... in order to stupefy you to sleep.
So that she and Daddy can sit down for three measly minutes without you... and your mindless, inexhaustible... unstoppable, repetitive and nagging demands.
"He took my toy." "She hit my bear."
"l want to potty." "l want a cookie."
"l want to stay up." "l want, I want."
"Me, me, me."
"Mine, mine, mine."
"Now, now, now."
Can't you understand, child?
- They tell you stories to shut you up.
- And conk you out.
That's not true, Jack.
You're a liar!
Lie?
Me?
Never.
The truth is far too much fun.
Oh, my child, before you were born... your parents would stay up all night together just to see the sunrise.
Don't be frightened.
Maggie, before you were born, they were happier.
Maggie, before you were born, they were happier.
They were free.
You're a bad man.
Flunk the maggot.
Abso-floggin'-lutely.
An "F"?
- He gave me an "F"!
- Jack.
Your father went to your sister's school play, did he not?
But did he go to your baseball game?
How'd you know about that?
He missed the most important game... on what might have been the most important day of your young life.
on what might have been the most important day of your young life.
- l wanna tear your hook off!
- Easy.
I hate you, Mr. Hook!
What did I tell you, Smee?
No little children love me.
'Course they do.
Come on, you.
You're depressing' the captain.
Jack, you listen to me.
Never let him make you forget.
- Never forget Mommy and Daddy!
- Maggie.
Think of a way to run home!
- Run home!
- Run home?
You are home.
Right?
Oh, yeah.
No, no.
We don't use them.
- Why do you have them?
- So we don't have to use them.
Don't crowd me!
Come on, Thud Butt!
- Everybody say grace.
- Bless this, Lord--
Grace!
All my favorite Never-foods.
Yams, mammee apples and banana squash.
Wash it down with calabash and poe-poe.
Can you blow on this?
Thank you.
This is good.
Are you eating that?
No.
Please.
Eat.
What's the deal?
Where's the real food?
If you can't imagine yourself being Peter Pan, you won't be him, so eat up!
Eat what?
There's nothing here.
Gandhi ate more than this.
This used to be your favorite game.
Forget the games. I want real food.
I want steak, eggs, coffee--
You can't!
Eat your heart out, you crinkled, wrinkled fat-bag!
You can't!
Eat your heart out, you crinkled, wrinkled fat-bag!
- You're very ill-mannered.
- You're a slug-eating worm.
- You can do better than that.
- You're encouraging them.
Yeah, show me your fastball, dust-brain.
You paunchy, sag-bottomed puke pot!
Bangerang, Rufio!
You are a very poor role model for these kids.
Do you know that?
I bet you don't have a fourth-grade reading level.
- Hemorrhoidal suck-navel.
- Maybe a fifth-grade reading level.
Boil-dripping, beef-fart-sniffing
Bangerang, Rufio!
Someone has a severe ca-ca mouth.
You are a fart factory... slug-slimed sack of rat guts and cat vomit... cheesy, scab-picked, pimple-squeezing finger bandage.
A week-old maggot burger with everything on it... and flies on the side!
- Substitute chemistry teacher.
- Rufio, hit him back.
Mung tongue.
- Math tutor.
- Pinhead.
- Prison barber.
- Mother lover.
- Nearsighted gynecologist.
- ln your face, camel cake!
- ln your rear, cow derriere.
- Lying, crying, spying ultra-pig!
You lewd, crude, rude bag-of-prechewed-food dude.
Bangerang, Peter!
You-
- You man!
Stupid, stupid man!
If I'm a maggot burger, why don't you just eat me?
You two-toned, zebra-headed, slime-coated... pimple-farmin', paramecium brain, munching' on your own mucus... suffering from Peter Pan envy!
What's a paramecium brain?
I'll tell you what a paramecium is.
That's a paramecium!
It's a one-celled critter with no brain that can't fly!
Don't mess with me, man.
I'm a lawyer!
Banning.
Banning.
Rufio!
Rufio!
Banning is bangerang!
Oh, Rufio, why don't you just go suck on a dead dog's nose?
Oh, Rufio, why don't you just go suck on a dead dog's nose?
- You're doing it.
- Doing what?
Using your imagination, Peter.
You're playing with us, Peter.
You're doing it.
Drink your poe-poe, Peter.
How is it?
Bangerang.
Catch !
Hey, Pockets, catch!
Oh, Don't Ask.
Bangerang!
Hey, Pan the Man, catch this!
- Peter, look out!
- Watch out!
Bangerang.
Peter, can I talk to you?
Sure, Thud.
I remember Tootles.
- You do?
- He was lost too.
How could you know Tootles?
He was a Lost Boy.
These are his marbles.
These are his happy thoughts.
- He really did lose his marbles.
- Yeah, he lost 'em good.
- Peter, you know what?
- What?
My happy thought will help you.
What's your happy thought, Thud?
Mine's my mother.
Do you remember your mother, Peter?
Wish I could.
Listen.
At night when I'm alone
At night when I'm alone I lie awake and wonder
My mom sang that song.
My young Jack, tell me about the game of baseball. I can't remember.
My young Jack, tell me about the game of baseball. I can't remember.
Are the mates standin' or are they on horseback?
The stars are all my friends
The stars are all my friends
Till the nighttime ends
So I know I'm not alone
So I know I'm not alone
When I'm here
On my own lsn't that a wonder isn't that a wonder
When you're alone
When you're alone
You're not alone
Not really alone
Not really alone
Good night, Neverland!
What is it?
I hear it again.
Smee, is that crocodile back from the dead?
Tick-tock, tick-tock.
is that the clock?
You killed that croc years ago, Captain.
We smash every clock we find.
The little elf didn't know any better.
To the museum at once.
Shine 'em up!
Put a fresh coat of varnish on your peg right here!
Shine 'em up!
Put a fresh coat of varnish on your peg right here!
Treasure maps!
Authentic treasure maps!
Broken clocks.
Each one ticked its last tock, and now all is well.
Each one ticked its last tock, and now all is well.
- Just listen.
- l don't hear anything.
I know!
Good form.
Exactly.
Jack, you see this?
Come over here.
You can take it.
This is Barbecue's very own bedside clock.
He was quite an infamous pirate.
I smashed this clock immediately after I gutted him.
And his ship made such a pretty bonfire on the waves.
What is that... I hear?
A ticking!
Smee, stop it!
Stop the ticking!
Stop it!
Stop that tick!
There's no ticking' here.
There's nothin' left to tick.
Oh, my God.
This is for the ticking that might have been.
This is for the ticking that might have been.
- Abso-floggin'-lutely!
- Get his father's watch.
Go on.
You know you want to.
Give it a try.
Go on.
This is for... never letting me blow bubbles in my chocolate milk!
- Yes!
- Good form!
Bravo!
Here you go.
Isn't that wonderful?
This is for never letting me jump on my own bed.
Make time stand still, laddie.
For always making promises and breaking them.
For never doing anything with me.
For a father who's never there, Jack.
Jack, for a father who didn't save you on the ship.
He wouldn't save us.
Who couldn't save you, Jack.
He-
- He wouldn't.
He didn't even try.
He was there and we were there, and he wouldn't try.
Jack, he will try.
And the question will be... when the time comes, do you want to be saved?
Don't you answer now.
Now it's time to be whatever you want to be.
Put behind you any thoughts of home... that place of broken promises.
That what?
Have I ever made a promise, Jack... I have not kept?
Have I, son?
Come on.
Let's go.
I don't like this game.
Steal Hook's hook as fast as you can.
It'll make you proud.
Then you'll crow like Pan.
Confound it, Druscilla, glove me.
The game is about to start.
I need my bubbly.
Give me my bubbly.
Steal Hook's hook, then crow.
Jackie, boy!
This is for all the games your daddy missed.
Hook would never miss your games, son.
You're almost there.
Just take it.
- What's he looking at?
- You're this close.
What's the matter?
It's right there.
Grab it.
Come on, Jack.
And-a-one... and-a-two, and a toodle-loodle-loo!
Strike!
Wait for the good pitches.
Jack, Jack, he's our man!
If he can't do it, nobody can !
He's stealing second!
Stop it!
We're playing this game according to Master Jack's rules.
Bad form.
Sit down now.
Let's resume the game.
Very violent sport, isn't it, baseball?
Run home, Jack!
Run home, Jack!
"Run home, Jack."
Smee!
No!
They've got it backwards!
Tell them to turn it around!
Maggie?
Switch !
Home run, Jack!
Home run, Jack.
He can't hit the curve.
My Jack!
My Jack.
You did it!
Hoist him up!
That's my boy!
You did it, son!
Two, four, six, eight!
Who do we appreciate?
Jack!
Jack!
Gotta fly.
Happy thought.
One great big happy thought.
Less is more.
I can!
"Tootles, Wendy...
John, Michael, Peter."
Be careful, Peter.
You're a lot taller than you used to be.
Well, say something.
Do you like my dress?
You look beautiful.
- What's the occasion?
- You are.
It's a "welcome home" party.
- What happened here?
- Hook.
Burnt it when you didn't come back.
Kiss.
Wendy.
This is Wendy's house.
Noodles and Nibs built it for her.
I remember.
- Wendy used to sit in that chair.
- Yes.
But it wasn't there.
It was here.
We used to sit here while she'd darn socks... and tell us stories.
She slept here.
Tink, your apartment was right here.
Yes.
Little Michael had his basket bed right here.
John.
Taddy.
My Taddy.
Mother used to put him in the pram to keep me company.
I remember my mother.
I remember her.
You can be sure of very fine schools indeed.
First he will attend Whitehall, then Oxford...
First he will attend Whitehall, then Oxford... and of course, after graduation... he will prepare for a judgeship in the highest court... making time for marriage and family... and all of that, just like his father.
Isn't that what grown-ups want for their children?
I was afraid because I didn't want to grow up... because everybody who grows up has to die someday.
So I ran away.
Tink... you came and you saved me.
You brought me to Neverland.
You taught me to fly.
But I was still a little boy... and I missed my mother... so I decided to fly home to my very own window.
But it was shut.
They'd forgotten about me.
I found other windows to visit... ones that weren't shut closed on me.
That's how I met Wendy.
I chased my shadow in her nursery.
I expected my shadow and I would join together like drops of water.
Boy.
Why are you crying?
What's your name?
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.
What's yours?
I came back many times for Wendy, always in the spring.
And Wendy kept getting older... and older... and then I came back the last time.
Peter, I can't come with you.
I've forgotten how to fly.
I'm old, Peter.
Ever so much more than 20.
- l grew up a long time ago.
- No!
No!
- You promised.
- l have children of my own now.
They have children of their own.
That's my grandchild, Moira, asleep in the bed.
That's my grandchild, Moira, asleep in the bed.
When I saw her lying there sleeping... that moment, something changed in me forever.
I shall give her a kiss.
No, Peter.
No buttons.
No thimbles.
I couldn't bear Moira's heartbreak when she finds she can't keep you.
I mean a real kiss.
I can see why you have trouble finding a happy thought.
So many sad memories, Peter.
Bye, Taddy.
Not Taddy.
Daddy.
Daddy!
Peter, you're a daddy.
Hi, Jack.
I know why I came back.
I know why I grew up.
I wanted to be a father.
I'm a daddy.
My happy thought.
I got it.
I found it!
I lost it.
Just hold that happy thought, Peter!
Peter Pan!
Pan.
He's back!
Play!
You are the Pan.
You can fly, you can fight and you can crow.
You can fly, you can fight and you can crow.
Tink, you in there?
- Are you sad?
- l'm neither.
Please go away.
Oh, you're sick.
Maybe you need a Band-Aid or a thermometer.
Thermometer'd make it all better.
That's how Nibs made Wendy better.
- No, Peter, it's not about that.
- Oh, yes it is.
Nibs put the thermometer in her mouth.
Got all better.
Don't we have the greatest adventures?
Do you remember your next great adventure to save your kids, Peter?
Kids?
Peter Pan's got kids?
Why are you in Neverland?
Easy.
To always be a little boy and have fun.
I like this game.
Ask me another one.
Oh, dear me!
I did it.
Tink, look what happened.
You broke your house.
You're humongous.
This is the only wish I ever wished for myself.
Peter, this is the biggest feeling I've ever felt.
This is the biggest feeling I've ever had... and this is the first time I've been big enough to have it.
Peter, I want to give you a kiss.
No. I mean a real kiss.
I love you, Peter Pan.
- l love--
- Yes?
- Her.
- Her who?
More.
Moira!
I love Moira... and Jack and Maggie.
Jack and Maggie.
I have a plan.
Come on.
You gotta come.
When it's all over, you'll leave and never come back again.
What are you staring at, Peter?
Save them.
Go save them.
You silly ass.
Go.
You know, Jack, it's a very special time when a pirate gets his first earring.
You know, Jack, it's a very special time when a pirate gets his first earring.
Such a very, very beautiful feeling.
It's like the first time you run someone through with your blade.
Now, Jack, I'm going to ask you to bend your head ever so slightly.
Now, Jack, I'm going to ask you to bend your head ever so slightly.
A little more.
That's it.
And brace yourself, lad... because this is really going to hurt.
because this is really going to hurt.
Smee, what is that?
Who is that, Captain?
It's Peter Pan.
Has it been three days?
'Tis true, Peter.
Time does fly.
And so do you, I see.
How did you ever manage to fit into those smashing tights again, Peter?
How did you ever manage to fit into those smashing tights again, Peter?
Hand over my son now, and you and your men may go free.
Why don't you ask the lad yourself?
Jack, someone to see you, son.
Jack, give me your hand.
We're going home.
I am home.
Good form.
You see, Peter, he is my son.
He loves me dearly and I'm prepared to fight dearly for him.
He loves me dearly and I'm prepared to fight dearly for him.
I've waited long to shake your hand with this.
Peter Pan, prepare to meet thy doom.
Dark and sinister man, have at thee.
Don't you love it, laddie?
Once you shed blood and dole out cruelty, it's hard to stop.
It's a pirate's life, my lad!
-Don't I know him, Captain?
-No.
You've never seen him in your life.
You won't believe this, but I've found my happy thought.
It took me three days to find it, but guess what happened when I did?
Up I went.
You know what my happy thought was?
It was you.
That's my dad, but he hates to fly.
Bangerang!
Bangerang!
Call out the village militia!
We'll need every last man!
If there's anybody not fighting, get here quick!
If there's anybody not fighting, get here quick!
Form ranks!
Form ranks!
Get ready to show 'em the white light we're made of, boys!
Remember the fires from hell that forged you !
Charge!
Now!
- Me eyes!
- l'm blind!
We'll show you who's chicken!
Watch this!
Smee, do something intelligent.
Smee!
Smee!
What about Smee?
What about Smee?
Smee's me.
What about me?
Thudball !
Fire!
Gangway!
Look out below!
Help!
Somebody, help!
Take it!
Lost Boys, down!
My eyes!
It's time for Smee.
Where do you think you're going?
Get away from that window!
Hook!
Rufio.
The old man is mine.
Jack!
Save me!
My Maggie.
Jack!
- Wait.
Ain't you--
- Peter Pan.
- Come on.
- Daddy!
Peter Pan's my... dad?
- Maggie!
- Get it off me!
I'll never lose you again.
Lost Boys, we got 'em on the run !
Bangerang!
Here comes Pan!
Looky, looky, I got Hooky.
Hook!
No!
- Do you know what I wish?
- What?
I wish I had a dad...
like you.
I wish I had a dad...
like you.
Oh, Dad, I'm sorry.
Are you ready for me, Peter?
Come on.
Humor the Hook.
Dad?
I wanna go home.
What are you talking about?
You are home.
Where are you going?
Lost Boys!
Victory banquet!
Peter!
Where are you going?
Come back here and fight me!
I'll find you wherever you are.
Do you hear me?
Bad form, Peter!
Come back!
You need a mother very, very badly!
Smee, follow me.
Stairs.
Just movin' your personals somewhere safer.
I swear to you, wherever you go, wherever you are... I vow there will always be daggers bearing notes signed "James Hook."
I vow there will always be daggers bearing notes signed "James Hook."
They will be flung at the doors of your children's children's children.
They will be flung at the doors of your children's children's children.
Do you hear me?
What do you want, old man?
- Just you.
- You got me, James Hook.
Pan the Avenger is back.
And the Hook is waiting, Peter Pan.
Put up your swords.
It's Hook or me this time.
- Prepare to die, Peter.
- To die would be a great adventure.
Death is the only adventure you have left.
- l remember you being a lot bigger.
- To a ten-year-old, I'm huge.
No pain, no gain, James.
Pan!
Good form, old man.
You know you're not really Peter Pan, don't you?
This is only a dream.
When you wake up, you'll just be Peter Banning... a cold, selfish man who drinks too much, is obsessed with success... and runs and hides from his wife and children.
- l believe in you.
- l believe in you.
I believe in you, Peter.
I believe in you.
You are the Pan.
You're Peter Pan.
I believe in you...
Peter Pan.
- Bad form!
- Stop!
Now we end this.
You blackguard!
Hello.
Tick-tock, tick-tock, Hook's afraid of an ordinary clock.
I think not. I think James Hook's afraid of time ticking away!
Good form, Peter.
I am fallen.
Give me my dignity.
You took my hand.
You owe me something.
You killed Rufio, you kidnapped my children.
You deserve to die.
You killed Rufio, you kidnapped my children.
You deserve to die.
Strike, Peter Pan.
Strike true.
Daddy... let's go home, please?
He's just a mean old man without a mommy.
Yeah, Dad.
Let's go.
He can't hurt us anymore.
Bless you, child.
Good form, Jack.
After all, what would the world be like without...
Captain Hook?
I want you to take your ship and go.
And I never want to see your face in Neverland again.
- Look out!
- Fools!
James Hook is Neverland!
Whenever children read, it will say...
"Thus perished Peter Pan."
What's happening?
What is happening?
I want my mommy!
Hook's gone.
Bangerang!
No more Hook!
No more Hook!
Hooray for Pan the Man !
What's wrong, Peter?
I can't stay and play.
I've done what I came to do and now I have to go back.
No, Peter, please.
Tink, make my kids glow.
Jack, Maggie... all you have to do is think one happy thought, and you'll fly like me.
all you have to do is think one happy thought, and you'll fly like me.
Mommy!
My dad...
Peter Pan.
Tink, you know the way.
I'll be just behind you.
Don't leave us, Peter, and don't say good-bye.
What's good-bye?
It's going away.
That's what it is.
Forgetting about us all over again.
You're all my Lost Boys.
I'll never forget you.
Never.
So who do I leave in charge?
I want you to take care of everyone who's smaller than you.
Okay.
Then who do I look after?
Neverbugs.
Little ones.
That was a great game.
Thank you for believing.
I know her.
She looks like an angel.
Let's not wake her yet.
Oh, my dear child.
Have you been up all night?
Oh, my dear child.
Have you been up all night?
I see them in their beds so often in my dreams... when I wake up, they're still there.
Mommy!
Tink.
Hello.
Havin' trouble with the missus?
You will have by the time you get home.
Say it, Peter.
Say it and mean it.
I believe in fairies.
You know that place between asleep and awake?
That place where you still remember dreaming?
That's where l'll always love you...
Peter Pan.
That's where l'll be waiting.
Nana!
Oh, give us a kiss.
Come here, you drool machine.
Maggie, Moira, Jack!
Brad, hi!
You've been holding this long?
I'm incredible.
Yeah.
Neverland.
Lost Boys.
Jim Hook, duel to the death.
I'll fill you in later.
I'd love to chat, but I gotta climb a drainpipe right now.
I'd love to chat, but I gotta climb a drainpipe right now.
Why?
'Cause I ran out of fairy dust.
If not, I would've flown up.
"Why?"
- Mom, I fought pirates!
- You would've loved it there!
Maggie, Moira, Jack!
Granny Wendy!
Let me in.
Please.
Excuse me.
Do you have an appointment?
What did I tell you about this window?
Always keep it open !
Never, ever, ever close it!
I have to take this.
Brad, have you ever wondered what it's like to feel the exhilaration of flying?
Brad, have you ever wondered what it's like to feel the exhilaration of flying?
Feel this.
Where have you been?
- Fly me, Daddy!
- Anytime, Maggie!
To infinity and back again.
Hello, Peter.
I missed the adventure again, didn't I?
I think these belong to you.
Look!
See!
Look!
I didn't lose my marbles after all!
Wendy, look!
I didn't lose my marbles after all!
Hello, boy.
Hello, Wendy lady.
Give us a squdge.
Boy, why are you crying?
I don't know.
A tear for every happy thought.
- One for me?
- One for me?
And one for me!
Seize the day!
So, your adventures are over.
Oh, no.
To live--
To live would be an awfully big adventure.
Boy, why are you crying?
Because I couldn't get my shadow to stick.
Besides, I wasn't crying.
I shall sew it on for you, my little man.
I shall sew it on for you, my little man.
It may hurt a little.
What's your name?
Wendy Moira Angela Darling.
- What's yours?
- Peter Pan.
Watch your daughter.
She's wonderful.
She's stealing the show.
I think it's perfectly sweet of you.
Louder!
I think it's perfectly sweet of you.
I shall give you a kiss if you like.
Don't you know what a kiss is?
I shall, once you give one to me.
Now I shall give you a kiss.
I don't ever wanna become a man.
I always wanna be a little boy and have fun.
We wanna be like Peter Pan We don't wanna grow up
Brad.
Yeah, I'm at my daughter's play.
It's impossible.
I'm on a plane to London tomorrow night with my family.
A children's hospital is dedicating an entire wing to Granny Wendy.
Brad...
Peter, you're missing it.
All right.
I want a meeting, tomorrow a.m.
Dad, my game!
You promised.
Listen, it's my son's big game.
Last game of the season.
Santa Series.
I gotta be there.
I promised.
We'll make it short.
I'll be there.
My word is my bond.
We never, never, never Never, never, never, never
Never, never, ever wanna grow up
Strike three!
You're out.
Bluejays, come on!
Jack!
Come on, Bluejays!
Bluejays!
Fire it up!
Where is your father?
He's missing it.
Daddy'll be here.
He promised.
Jerry?
Jack?
- Jim.
- I said that.
Go to the game ahead of me.
Film what I miss.
This is the speech for your grandmother's tribute.
- On cards?
- Yes.
- Number those.
Who wrote it?
- Ned Miller.
I loved his annual report.
Read it.
"For the past 70 years, the Granny Wendy we honor tonight has given hope and care and life to hundreds of orphans."
Great.
Mommy, where's Daddy?
My briefcase.
Gotta fly.
Don't worry.
More people crash in cars.
It's a lot safer to fly than crossing the street.
If it's your time to go, it's your time to go.
And remember, don't let your arms get tired!
What if it's the pilot's time to go?
Come on, keep us alive, Banning!
Keep us alive!
Okay, come on!
Hi, Mrs. Banning.
I'm from the office.
Which one's your son?
- He's up to bat!
- Thank you!
Come on, Jack!
Come on, pal!
Come on, Jack!
Don't look at me!
Focus!
Stay focused!
Come on, Jack.
One time, Jack.
Come on, Jack!
Come on, Jack!
Please, not a curve ball.
Mama wants a new pair of shoes.
Drive me home, Jack!
That's the game!
Yeah, Brad, that's real good.
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, your captain again.
Please do not allow this minor turbulence to disturb you.
For now, please sit back, relax.
Enjoy the remainder of the flight.
Thank you.
Look what Jack drew!
That's very nice, dear.
What's that?
Fire.
Fire!
Really?
Is that our plane?
Who are these people?
That's Jack, that's me, that's Mom and that's you.
Where's my parachute?
- I won't make it to my birthday.
- You won't die without a phone.
I got the phone in the briefcase.
Talk to him.
Why didn't I have a parachute, Jackie?
Take a wild guess.
- Jackie!
- Jack.
Will you stop?
You can break a window.
They're layered.
You can't break them.
Give me that.
You're afraid you'll get sucked out.
I'm not afraid.
Yes, you are.
You're afraid you'll be sucked out.
Just stop.
Jack, next season, I'm coming to six games.
I promise.
Yeah, be sure to buy enough videotape.
My word is my bond.
Yeah, junk bond!
When are you gonna stop acting like a child?
I am a child.
Grow up.
It's been a long time.
Let's have fun, Peter.
London's a magical place for children.
- It was for us.
- And expensive.
Jack, don't do that.
You could put someone's eye out.
Maggie.
Maggie.
Peter, it's number 14.
Sorry.
What do you say to Granny Wendy?
- "How do you do?"
- Jack, get down!
Be careful.
Is Granny Wendy the real, real Wendy from my play?
No, not really.
Sort of.
Don't be a sloucher.
Take that gum out of your mouth.
It's time to look our best.
First impressions are the most important.
Shoes tied.
Shirt tucked.
You know this.
Remember, you're in England, land of good manners.
Uncle Tootles.
It's snowing!
Look at these adorable children!
It's good to see you, Libby...
Linda...
Lisa...
- Liza.
- I said that.
Oh, Moira, how are you?
You look wonderful!
Oh, my God!
Look at the size...
Look at you!
Such a sweet thing!
- Granny Wendy will be right down.
- She's upstairs?
Oh, good.
- Big boy!
You could play rugby.
- No, baseball.
Oh, look.
- Did you do this for us?
- We've been cooking all week.
You've been cooking?
What've you been cooking?
Mince pies?
Peter, look at this.
Look at this.
- Who's that?
- It's you.
Was I ever that young?
- What's gotten into you?
- This house has gotten to me.
Some of those things I was when I was young have never left me.
Oh, thank God!
We were children in these rooms.
Lost, lost, lost.
Lost what?
I've lost my marbles.
Lisa?
Liza.
- He was supposed to be in a home.
- It broke Wendy's heart.
Tootles is Wendy's first orphan.
Which is which?
Large bag's mine, and the smaller ones are the children's.
Hello, boy.
Hello, Wendy.
I told you, Gran, I'd get him here, by hook or by crook.
I'm sorry it's been so long between visits.
It's been 10 years between visits.
But never mind.
Come and give me a skwoodge.
Oh, Moira, Moira, Moira!
Who is this lovely lady?
It can't be Maggie.
Yes, it can.
And know what?
I just played you at school.
And don't you just look the part.
Can this giant be Jack?
How much you've grown in a year!
I'm supposed to tell you about congratulations for opening the orphan hospital and how great the dedication is.
- Thank you so very much.
- Welcome.
Now, there is one rule I insist be obeyed while you are in my house:
No growing up.
Stop this very instant.
And that includes you, Mr. Chairman-of-the-Board Banning.
Sorry, too late, Gran.
And what's so terribly important about your terribly important business?
You see, when a big company's in trouble Dad sails in, and if there's any resistance...
He's exaggerating.
I'm still into mergers and acquisitions.
And I'm dabbling in some land development.
Any resistance and he blows them out of the water.
So!
Peter, you've become a pirate!
Brad's on the line.
He says it's urgent!
Do you like my dress?
Great, Gran.
Thanks.
Hey, Brad.
Good news?
What?
What Sierra Club report?
I thought we had these guys.
He's trying to suck my blood!
He drools all over my neck.
What did they find?
- That's a portable phone...
- A Cozy Blue Owl?
Well, listen.
Ask them if anybody misses the Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Oh, well, I do!
Boy, do I ever!
Wow, you kidding?
Wait a minute.
You telling me a 10-inch owl has a 50-mile mating radius?
Why don't they just fornicate someplace else?
You're telling me a 5-billion-dollar deal is falling apart because of this?
Somebody shoot me in the head!
Bang!
Bang!
Will everybody just shut up!
I'm sorry.
Leave me alone for one moment!
Get them out of here!
I'm on the phone call of my life!
Come on, Jack.
Out, out, out.
Come with me.
I'll show you the window where your dad and I used to blow out the stars.
I should've stayed till the deal was done.
Granny asked you to visit every year.
I've been busy.
You promised the children some real time here.
You haven't looked at them once.
- That's not true.
- How many more broken promises?
It's Brad, Moira.
I gotta take this call.
I gotta fix this.
No, you gotta fix your family first.
Peter, hello?
Are you there?
What?
- I'm sorry about your deal.
- You hated the deal.
I hated the deal.
But I'm sorry you feel so badly about it.
Your children love you.
They want to play with you.
How long do you think that lasts?
Soon Jack may not even want you to come to his games.
We have a few special years with our children when they're the ones that want us around.
Then you'll be running after them for a bit of attention.
It's so fast, Peter.
It's a few years, then it's over.
And you are not being careful.
And you are missing it.
Peter, where are you?
Peter!
Peter!
Peter!
"All children, except one, grow up."
Now, you know where faeries come from, don't you, Maggie?
"When the first baby laughed for the first time the laugh broke into a thousand pieces and they all went skipping about.
That was the beginning of faeries."
And look.
I'm Wendy.
Or was, a long time ago.
But Jack says you're not the really "real" Wendy.
Do you see where Jack is?
Well, that's the same window.
And this is the same room where we made up stories about Peter, Never Land and scary old Captain Hook.
And do you know, Mr. Barrie, well, Sir James, our neighbor loved our stories so much that he wrote them all down in a book.
Oh, dear me, 80 years ago.
You're really old!
That's very true.
I'm sorry to break this up.
I have to steal Granny or she'll be late for the most important event of her life.
Oh, dear.
Daddy, I made something for you.
You're gonna love this.
It's a hug.
Next time you fly, you won't have to be scared.
She's made you a parachute.
That's very clever, dear.
Get away from there!
What have I told you about playing near open windows?
Keep this window closed.
Do we have open windows at home?
No.
They've all got bars on them.
Come on.
Into bed.
Who took my baseball?
That mean, scary man at the window stole it.
There's no scary man.
But he says he's a window washer.
What's this?
A baseball glove.
You can catch things with it take hot things out of the oven, hit your sister with it.
Tootles made it for me.
It smells nice.
It's paper, honey.
Hey, Jack.
Faker.
You're in charge now.
This is my very special watch, so you can keep track of the time.
Don't go out, Mom.
Please.
Good night.
Dear night-lights, protect my sleeping babes.
Burn clear and steadfast tonight.
I read recently that they're now using lawyers instead of rats for experiments.
They do this for two reasons:
One, the scientists become less attached to the lawyers.
And two, there are certain things that even rats won't do.
I thank the Board of Trustees of the Ormond Street Hospital for having me here this evening and beg your forgiveness because normally I address shareholders.
We don't know each other, and I doubt that we have very much in common except this wonderful woman, Wendy Angela Darling.
Granny Wendy brought me in from the cold.
She taught me to read and write.
She even found people to be my parents and adopt me.
She's loved so many children just so efforlete...
efforse... effortlessly.
That's her achievement.
Many of you here tonight were once lost children but Granny Wendy found parents and homes for each of you and saved you.
That's her miracle.
I know that if you could stand now, you would express much better than I have your feelings of gratitude appreciation and warm feelings for this wonderful woman.
I guess we do have something in common.
We're orphans.
Hook!
Hook.
Jack...
You all right?
Wendy?
Thank you, Nigel.
Norman?
Neville, sir.
Is that English?
Merry Christmas.
I was proud of you.
It was a beautiful speech.
Yes, it was.
Liza?
Tootles?
My God!
The children!
Jack!
Answer me!
Maggie!
The wind came up.
The door closed on me and the children were screaming!
The children were screaming!
The window.
"Dear Peter:
Your presence is required at the request of your children.
Kindest personal regards J.A.S. Hook Captain."
Have to fly.
Have to fight.
Have to crow.
Have to save Maggie.
Have to save Jack.
Hook is back.
Who?
Gran!
Well, the lab boys can analyze this little lot.
We've wired the phones, and two of my lads will be outside at all times.
It's possible that this is some kind of ridiculous prank.
My children are missing.
Yes, but the literary history of the family suggests...
Let's hope...
I've forgotten how to fly.
Yeah, well, one does.
Good night, ma'am.
Good night, sir.
No more happy thoughts.
Lost!
Lost!
- The police will do everything they can.
- The police can do nothing.
Really?
Maybe we should call the American police.
In a crisis, we English always make a cup of tea.
Moira, would you?
Yes, of course.
Don't forget to warm the pot.
I'll go.
You stay.
Don't worry, Gran Wendy, I wasn't gonna leave.
Hand me my book, please.
It's time to tell you, at last.
Tell me what?
How far back can you remember, Peter?
I remember the hospital on Great Ormond Street.
You worked with orphans.
You arranged for the adoption by my American parents.
You were 12, nearly 13.
I mean, before that.
There's nothing before that.
Try, Peter.
Do try.
Nothing.
You know, when I was young no other girl held your favor the way I did.
I expected you to alight on the church and forbid my vows on my wedding day.
I wore a pink satin sash.
But you didn't come.
Grandma?
Yes, I was an old lady when I wrapped you in blankets.
A grandmother.
With my 13-year-old granddaughter asleep in the bed.
Moira.
And when you saw her that was when you decided not to go back to Never Land.
Where?
To Never Never Land.
- I'll get Moira.
- I've tried to tell you...
- Maybe the tea's ready.
- I knew you'd forgotten!
I'm not ready to deal with this now.
The stories are true.
I swear to you.
I swear on everything I adore.
And now he's come back to seek his revenge.
The fight isn't over for Captain James Hook.
He wants you back.
He knows you'll follow Maggie and Jack to the ends of the earth.
And, by heaven, you must find a way.
Only you can save your children.
Somehow, you must go back.
You must make yourself remember.
Remember what?
Peter, don't you know who you are?
Yes, boy.
Yes.
Sorry.
Parachute...
Firefly from hell!
Big damn bug!
It is you!
It is!
A big you!
It's not bad you're big.
You were always big.
Maybe this means you'll be twice as much fun.
What fun we'll have again!
What times!
What great games!
You're a little...
Faerie.
Pixie.
If less is more, there's no end to me, Peter Pan.
- Peter Banning.
- Pan.
- Banning.
- Pan.
Whoever you are, it's still you.
Because only one person has that smell.
Smell?
The smell of someone who's ridden the wind.
The smell of sleeping in trees.
Adventures with Indians and pirates.
Remember?
The world was ours!
We could do everything or nothing.
I had to be anything because it was always us.
It's happened.
I'm having a nervous breakdown.
Follow me and all will be well.
I'm dying.
Heading towards the white light.
I've left my body.
There's my house down there.
There are my feet.
- Where are we going?
- To save your children!
- How do you know about my kids?
- Everybody knows!
Hook's got them and you've gotta fight him!
Let's fly!
It is true, then.
You did grow up.
I drank poison for you.
You used to call me "Tink."
- Have you forgotten everything?
- Are you in there, bug?
I'm not a bug.
I'm a faerie.
I do not believe in faeries.
Anytime someone says, "I do not believe in faeries," a faerie falls down dead.
I do not believe in faeries!
My God, I think I killed it.
Are you alive, little bug?
Look out!
Clap your hands, Peter.
It's the only way to save me.
Clap...
Louder.
Louder, Peter!
I'm clapping!
Oh, God, you're alive!
All right.
Now, who am I?
You're a Freudian hallucination of my mother.
I don't know why you have wings, but you have lovely legs.
What am I saying?
I'm an orphan.
I've never taken drugs.
I missed the '60s.
I was an accountant.
Guess again!
Look, stars!
That's right, Peter.
Second star to the right and straight on till morning.
Never Land!
What a nightmare!
Roll out!
Roll out!
Lovely fish!
Fresh fish!
We keep the eyes in so they'll see you through the week!
Excuse me.
Is there a pay phone around here?
That is so real.
Peter, get back here!
Get down!
Get low!
Hide!
If it ain't the Mother Inferior.
Gentlemen, I'm looking for someone.
I fancy them shiny shoes for my booties.
I think you can get them at Armani.
Tink!
Tink!
Help!
Don't get no blood on them boots!
They's mine!
Help me!
Tinkerbell!
You pixie devil!
Please don't!
I have a bad back!
You pixie devil!
